2.0,This dress/long tunic fits really strange.  It's tight across the chest and I'm not busty and the dress fabric (not sleeve) is rough and scratchy and doesn't give like the sleeves do.
2.0,very thin. not sweatshirt material. its like a long sleeve t-shirt material.
2.0,Wore these stockings once and they ran through. Bought another pair just because it is so hard to find ivory stockings that I like. And yet again they ran through! It's true what they say that prices can match the quality.
2.0,"I got the 3X but lol this has hardly any stretch or you will pop the threads as seen in my photos. The part around your waist has a little stretch but none over the shoulders. The underwires come out. It’s cheap & cute but too small for this big girl. I’m 365lbs 48dd and brave enough to wear this but naw. So, if you’re about 265-320, I think it should fit or 40D."
2.0,hate the fabic
2.0,They did not look as flashy in person but okay.
2.0,"The colors are nothing like the picture and I am viewing them on an iPad Pro. The real life colors are more garish and not as muted as pictured, e. g. the blue is a bright royal blue, not a muted, almost greenish dark blue, the red is a very bright red, not like a burgundy. I was really hoping I would receive something close to what’s shown on the Amazon website. The material is not much to write home about but that’s what I expected and I’m fine with that. I wanted something lightweight to wear instead of a heavy scarf and this will work for me (its not itchy, that’s good). It’s the color difference that I’m disappointed with!!! Oh well, they were cheap, so the two stars are for the ok material."
2.0,Fabric  is not soft
2.0,I purchased the navy color in my normal size large and it was too big. I returned it to exchange for a medium in the beige color. It just arrived and I will be returning that one because the beige in real life looks more yellow than tan.
2.0,Wore this for less then 2 hours and little bits of paint were all over my chest. Do not purchase
2.0,I thought it was going to be a little more dressy. It's an oversized sweatshirt
2.0,Product itself is good.  Ordered a size bigger than I normally wear based on sizing reccomendations and it is still too small.  The red is more pink than red.
2.0,More than one pair of socks should be in the package for this price. Leaving specifics off the description is sneaky.
2.0,I’ve been looking for a cute blazer short set. I ordered the rose/fuchsia. The color was bright and beautiful! But it definitely was not what I thought it was. In the picture the shorts look like it has a hook closure. What I received was an elastic waist short. The material was like a satin polyester blend. The images make the short set look sturdier. I do not recommend. I will be returning this set.
2.0,"Fit great when I took it out of the package,  then when I washed it it shrunk in length and didn't fit as well as it did before"
2.0,"Nice cap, but not meant to fit an adults head. This cap is made for a child."
2.0,"If you can make your own, do it. I tried to put it on and I cut my nose because the edges are so sharp. I will need to sand it down to make it smooth and add detail to the mask."
2.0,small for a young child&#34;s wrist.Beads are not 6mm
2.0,"Came with a hole in it, did not notice until someone showed it to me ."
2.0,"The nightgown is too tight in the hips. It also has a seam attaching the bodice to the rest of the gown that has no darts or gathering and is not flattering. It would be better off to not have the seam. As it is, it makes the bust line look flat and the hips tight."
2.0,They are nothing like the picture. Very shinny yellow gold and much smaller than they appeared. But they are still fine earrings. Just not at all what is advertised
2.0,"The latch is so tight, I could not get the watch on or off without using my teeth. Also, the watch is so long and I have to get it sized by going to a jeweler to remove some of the links for me to be able to wear it. I am a big woman and the watch is too big on my wrist. I don't think it is worth the trouble to have to go to a jeweler to have to get it sized. Especially, not for a watch that is under $20. I do not recommend."
2.0,These are panty hose type of thin.
2.0,Paint came off after a couple days and irritated my nose. It's  too bad because they are super cute
2.0,"This is a really cute design but that is the only good thing about it. It’s really thin. It runs really small. I’m 5’5” 36B and usually wear a small, sometimes x small. I ordered a medium and could wear it but the room was limited under the armpits. The worst part about this is it is all polyester and will make you sweat!"
2.0,"The overall design of the suit is cute, but I ordered a size large based on the size chart as I usually wear a 10 in pants. However, the bottoms are definitely too small. The top almost fits, but I have a large bust (36 D/DD depending on brand) and I think an XL will fit better without making me feel like my boobs are being squished out the top. My biggest complaint though is that the super cute wide black and white striped fabric is pretty thin and the back of the bottoms are unlined so the white areas are pretty see through. I can only imagine how sheer they would be once wet. I am returning for both of these reasons. I have ordered an XL in a darker color so I can hopefully be a little more modest, but I loved the black and white pattern so I'm sad that the quality of the bottoms was so poor."
2.0,This runs big.
2.0,The fabric is great (black/white gingham) but I was really disappointed in the fit of this item. I ordered a medium but it did not fit right at all. I normally wear a small or medium.
2.0,"I usually wear a L. Purchased 2XL. It’s very low rise! Barely covers half my butt. Other than that, the fabric is nice and soft."
2.0,"The chain looks great, but broke in less than 4 months. I guess you get what you pay for, but I’m still disappointed."
2.0,Extremely tight under the arm pit
2.0,"Not cute like the pic. Jersey material, I was thinking it would be more flowy. Returned."
2.0,"I returned it - looks like a dress, not a swimsuit"
2.0,just looks cheap
2.0,"It's ok it was comfortable to wear.  You have to remove it, can't wear it in the shower.  I wore it to a wedding and it was a nice addition to my outfit.<br />If you're used to the finer things in life, this isn't for you"
2.0,Very form fitting. I will be returning this or giving it away .
2.0,I loved this as soon as I got it but once I washed it it looked cheap and the fabric no longer looks as vibrant. Super disappointing. I'm sure it looks nice from afar but up close it looks really cheap. Not worth the money I spent on it or the money I spent on a second one before I realized how bad it was.
2.0,makes my head hurt.
2.0,I ordered a 22 mm watch band. The watch band itself is a little bit too firm and stiff but OK for the price.<br />Problem: The included spring bars are about one millimeter too short which makes them unusable. I had to take out these and to use the spring bars from the original old watch band to be able to mount these WOCCI Quick Release Watch Band to my watch.
2.0,"There is thick stiff padding for your back and not where you need it.  Additionally, the leg holes are angled not horizontal.  They are long in the crotch and short on the sides. Strangest fit ever."
2.0,"It is supposed to be sterling, but does not look like it--not mellow glow but very shiny.  I will take to jeweler & update review based on that."
2.0,This is just one of those you-get-what-you-pay-for things. The only thing that I wish is that they'd managed to get it here more quickly.
2.0,"Lightweight and true to size however back heel  is pressed inward and side corners around the ankle are not formed comfortably with a poi yes edge and turn inward as well.  Within no less than 10 minutes of wearing the shoes, my son was crying because he had blisters on the inside of his ankles and I had to carry him.  Even after applying bandaids, the friction was too much and we had to come home to get a different pair of shoes."
2.0,The thong (piece that goes in between toes) is pretty thick and my toddler was complaining it hurt so had to return it.
2.0,I like the pocket for my phone but I don't like the fact that there is no bill size pocket for money. My bills have to be folded.
2.0,Slit in front is cut too high
2.0,Material was too warm for me. And with Summer coming. Was very well-made but I just need a lighter material.
2.0,The auto open/close broke after a short number of uses
2.0,Needed this for work...said it had no pockets ...it has a pocket....I work in a food grade factory and am not allowed to have clothing with pockets so this is a waste of money...somebody please make clothes that can be worn in a work environment
2.0,Really REALLY  bright; which is nice however it doesn't fit an 18 sized neck. Runs smaller. By fits most necks; means if you lift weights DON'T expect it to fit at all.
2.0,The metal is very soft and scratches/dents easily. It also doesn't swivel so it doesn't lay flat against the other keys.
2.0,I know the details say it runs small but needs to read runs &#34;real small&#34;&#34; like Barbie doll versus regular doll size small.
2.0,I bought 3x they more like a LG
2.0,The directions say to charge the batteries before using. There is no battery charger or any place to plug it in.
2.0,I love these  glasses
2.0,not much to it
2.0,They were a little too big even though I got my right size but comfortable. I gave it two starts because the material feels really cheap and one of the shoes had a stain on it. Also I thought they were going to be a lighter color like in the picture but it wasn't it was more of a dark colored nude and the shoe laces seem somewhat dirty.
2.0,"Very disappointed...fabric design is good but the skirt description is incorrect.  It says 'elastic waist with drawstring ' but this is just a wrap around skirt, barely enough to go around made of flimsy fabric."
2.0,"I bought this item based on reviews, primarily focused on the sturdiness of continual use. Sorry to say, the reviews don't hold up and the product simply is not of the quality stated. First off, the impression from the pictures is that a metal turnbuckle is under the plastic (black) sheath. NOT TRUE, it is simply hardened plastic with nut female receptacles at each end. I used this once on a cotton pair of shorts, and even in tightening there was play in the shaft and nut fitting together. Play is a simple way of saying the shaft and nut do not fit exactly and you can jiggle then when screwed into each other. Not good.<br /><br />The shorts did stretch as advertised. But then I used them on a pair of Levi's, and the unit simply bowed (as you tighten, the shaft starts to bend upward) and became hard to turn and the turnbuckle portion (the plastic shaft in the middle that I assumed was all steel) just bent. $23 bucks is not a bad price, and with the hardware and wood workmanship, is probably right on as a price point. The problem is in the missing steel turnbuckle in the middle, which is hard plastic.<br /><br />The best I can say is he/she designer gave me the blueprint to make something that will actually work and I ordered a forged (all) steel turnbuckle from E Rigging. I will cut my own wood pieces and have an ultra sturdy unit that will never fail. A six inch turnbuckle with a 3/4 shaft that will hold 5200lbs.<br /><br />Admittedly I turned it until very tight (stretching the jeans waist), but by<br /><br />the sellers description of the product and sturdiness, this should not have been a problem.<br /><br />I like to see inventive people successful, I hope they come up with a sturdier design and make a million bucks.  ;-)))"
2.0,These are what they say they are. But not what I needed. Thanks amyway
2.0,I bought these to replace a pair of real sterling earrings that I had worn for years. These are cheap and flimsy. They bend out shape very easily. You truly do get what you pay for.
2.0,it is over priced and too big for my newborn baby! i never used it. and the pic looks way cuter than the actual item.
2.0,"The print/font is larger than in the pic. Not exactly like the one Gilmour wears in the vintage pics. Not horribly big, just not the same. Not as advertised."
2.0,It does not stay on because there is no locking mechanism
2.0,Not material expected . Fit like spandex
2.0,"Its ok. I thought it was cotton or cotton mix, but its a very cheap polyester material. Kinda cheap idk. It also runs large. I ordered another one from a different seller and its way nicer. Going to donate this one."
2.0,It says it's handmade no it isn't and it looks a lot thicker in the picture. Not very happy with it.
2.0,Unfortunately these came with a crack in the side. Also they're pink instead of the purple and blue in the photo. Bummed because they were a gift.
2.0,The round part that goes into the wood is to large to fit stretcher.
2.0,"Just received today!  The watch band is nice looking however, the metal on the back of the watch band is discolored.  Disappointed that their is not a better quality control check in place.  I am not able to post a picture at this time or I would have. I so wanted to give this watch band a higher review but I just can’t due to the discoloration.  I hate having to hassle with returns so will probably have to keep it!"
2.0,These were pretty but impossible to put in and my ears got pretty gross. I’ll stick to surgical steel.
2.0,The material is a little thin and cheap. The neckline is like a man's undershirt. The buttons at the bottom are cute but not cute enough to overlook the neckline. Maybe if you wear a scarf to cover it.
2.0,They’re pretty but you can tell that it’s just cut up wires painted
2.0,Felt like it didn't have enough texture to the material. Felt baggy. I do love the colors. I'm just going to keep washing and drying in the dryer hopefully it will shrink
2.0,"This was a little small for my big head and wasn't that comfortable, as a result it seemed to move quite a bit and get in the way. Used it for about 5 minutes while walking my dogs then took it off and returned"
2.0,Material is so stiff no stretch what so ever. And the front where ur chest is supposed to go is so flimsy.  Overall an ok product for the price
2.0,Color is really faded...shirt is very soft...Not loving the fit. It runs small
2.0,it broke in half
2.0,"I don't like the height of the bag and the inner pouch that sits in the middle of the bag.  It is hard to find anything in the bag and the pouch in the middle makes it difficult without actually looking in the bag.  There are too many straps and the handle is not as flexible as it could be because of the metal.  Overall, the leather is really hard and I like soft leather.  I won't purchase any more products by this brand."
2.0,"This is a super cute, but ridiculously small sweatshirt. First off I should say it is well made, except for one little string sticking out of the shoulder. Also it's a really nice material. I love the pattern they have going on, but if you're over 100 pounds this probably won't fit. I wouldn't consider myself a fat person, but this made me feel obese. When it comes to sweatshirts I usually get a medium, because I like a nice baggy feel. So with this I got the US 10. Which is the 2XL in their world. I swear the women over there must be super SUPER tiny, because if this is a 2XL I can't even fathom what their Small would look like.<br />Anyway because their sizes are always a little off I figured go big. Worst case scenario it'll be too big, which isn't really even possible when it comes to sweatshirts. So, like I was saying I assumed this would be baggy on me. Well I couldn't even get my arms in it. Without putting my arms in the sleeves I could slide it past my shoulders, but it only went to about two inches below my boobs. So there is no way this will fit me. It could definitely pass as childrens clothing. Which sucks because it's really cute. Too bad it's so small. For comparison I put a photo of this sweatshirt laying on top of a medium sweatshirt. As you can see it is much smaller. So size ten my butt."
2.0,This thing was not even a half shirt. I'm 5' 125 pounds and a small fit like a training bra. Great material but way too short to even call a crop top.
2.0,"I cannot get the tangles out of the wig, it does not sit on my head correctly, the bangs are too long and it is very hot (as in warm) to wear. I wish I had gone with a short wig."
2.0,"They are super cute, but pinch my daughters ears when she wears them. She doesn't have fat earlobes, but they pinch her. She wore them for one day and left a red mark on her ears. She hasn't worn them ever since. They are also very difficult to screw the back on to secure the earrings in my daughter's ears. I would not recommend others to purchase. Don't get me wrong....they are super cute, but horrible on the ears. In the words of my 6 year old daughter, she said that she hates them and doesn't want to wear them again."
2.0,"I have a much older version of this same Russel Athletic sweatshirt and liked it so much I decided to order a new one.<br /><br />Pill city!<br /><br />And this after one single wearing and washing.  You would think they would have the technology to elimiate this problem. In fact they must've had it, because my old sweatshirt doesn't get pills."
2.0,I used this for no more than a week and it is already starting to come apart. I guess you get what you pay for. It looks nice but don't expect it to last long.
2.0,"The print and cut of dress are cute, BUT the actual fabric of it is EXTREMELY thin and see through. Not worth the price for how cheap the fabric is. Would have been perfect if not so thin and see through :("
2.0,"Sent back without even trying it on.  It is thick material, almost like a costume.  Couldn't wear this to my event."
2.0,I’m not even tall yet somehow this fits me like a shirt
2.0,The material and fit are great. Pattern is okay but the strap ripped making it unusable.
2.0,Did absolutely nothing for me. Maybe I needed to buy a smaller size.
2.0,"I got these for my moms birthday and turns out that when she opened them the owls were upside down. She said it didn't bother her, but just fair warning... they will more than likely come upside down."
2.0,"I will give 2 stars because it is not hematite stone how I wanted, that is black onyx, two different people confirmed it."
2.0,"I ordered based off the sizing chart, I'm rather busty. These bra's are awful. I was overflowing & there was way too much bounce. Not comfy at all. I'm disappointed. I had high hope's for these bra's."
2.0,Smells weird like plastic and looks like mustard.
2.0,It was much larger than I had expected. The material isn’t as soft and drapey as it looks in the picture. It looks like a lab coat. I won’t wear it out but it will make a decent house coat.
2.0,This was a good idea  for a 40th party - but it has a bunch of facts that no one really knows. Maybe include levels of easy/medium/hard. I may return since no one could play it. A party of 90% Detroiters (and metro Detroiters) and MANY Lions Fan attended :-/
2.0,"Siiigh. I really wanted to like this dress. I am 5&#34;3, 140 lbs. 35-26-36. I generally wear a size 4-6. I read that it was stretchy but got a medium. The sleeves DO have a lot of stretch in them, but it just looks weird and too form fitting. I have muscular arms. My waist is tiny however, the waist and shoulders were too big. I just feel like I would have to get the large to get the arms to fit slightly loose like in the picture, but would have to alter the entire middle to have it fit right. It just doesn't flatter my muscular hourglass shape. It 's a shame because I realllly like it on the model, I love Miusol dresses. But I feel like you need small arms for it. Mine aren't big, but they aren't dainty."
2.0,A little heavier than what  I expected.  They will be OK.  Very durable.  Seemed like they may have had something heavy placed on top of the package for an extended period of time.  There appears to be dirt and weak points where the bags were folded.  I hope they don't develop leaks in those areas.
2.0,The chain arrived in one day. However it was tangled in a knot and unusable.
2.0,The medium size is to big and the top doesn't  have any shape. i dint like it at all.
2.0,"looks nice. I ordered a 10, but the fit was a little too exact. I would buy it again but I'm no longer interested. gave it to my sister who wears a 9"
2.0,"NOT A SWEATER DRESS.  It's an ok and rather see through fabric.  I like the cut, don't mind the fit but don't call it a sweater dress.  Nothing sweater about it."
2.0,"The wasit band is a tiny elastic within a larger fabric band so it fits really weird. It's be better if the elastic was removed and the fabric stronger to hold the waist or if it was as wide as the actual fabric of the band. They are cute otherwise, but I won't keep them because of the waist band."
2.0,This brand runs small.  If you're a US 12/14 then buy XXL because this brand of dresses are made for petite females
2.0,Look and feel like toy glasses but I still wear them..
2.0,conform
2.0,Fabric is a spandex would have worked better in cotton<br />Not cut for bigger bust
2.0,Turned my ears green after wearing for about 3 days
2.0,not sure if they know correct sizes
2.0,Picture made purse look larger.
2.0,This is very large and gaudy. I wouldn’t recommend it for a Pandora or other charm bracelet.
2.0,"These are big and I like that but hate everything else. They do not sit on the face well at all. Looks very cheap, not good like the photos...and sort of dirty/dusty too. Ew. The fake gold finish looks so crappy. I wish I had a better camera to show just how crappy. On one side the hinges seem really stiff and the other incredibly loose. They won’t last, guaranteed. Good thing I only paid about ten bucks because this is a waste and a disappointment."
2.0,Not what it appears
2.0,"This is somewhat disappointing.  The pattern looks the same as the one in the photo, but the cut is different.  There is no slit in the side and it is significantly shorter than the ones in the photos.  It only comes down to around the bottom of my butt...and I'm not that tall.  The fit is pretty tight around the arms...not quite as expected.  Also in the photo it shows a branded tag, but this doesn't have that, just a small size tag.  It's clearly a cheaply made knock off.  It's still cute on, but is definitely not what is shown in the pictures."
2.0,"First and foremost, why the heck is the liner brown in a black purse!? I can't deal with that. Brown and black don't go together. Period. I expect black, I see black in the photos. Why do I have brown!?<br /><br />I also now see what the other reviewers mean about the liner not filling the whole purse. What's up with that? I've never had a purse like this. It's almost like the liner was an after thought, with no thought put in it. Fortunately for me, I don't need a huge purse to fit my stuff. I carry the basics and nothing more so while the liner is dumb, it's not too restricting if you're more minimal with the things you carry.<br /><br />Also, the way it's packaged, it leaves you with that bend at the bottom on one side. They literally wrap it around a foam tube which creates it. Again, not understanding the thought process here.<br /><br />This is a purse you'll use for a bit, throw it with your other purses, and probably never grab again once you buy another. I'll use it, but I'm not thrilled with it.<br /><br />Probably would have rated better if it were cheaper. I've bought plenty of good purses for $20. This isn't worth that price."
2.0,"The sizing is definitely off. I wear a 1x in shirts (large, occasionally extra large in mens), but ordered an XXL because a juniors XXL sometimes fits more like a women's 1x and this fits like a women's large or extra large (xl fits smaller than 1x for those that don't know) and is tight around my chest, but I've never had that issue before. Design looks cool and retro, but feels tacky and kinda sticky in some spots. Might just return it for my money back and get a different Disney villains shirt from Hot Topic instead."
2.0,These were wayyyy bigger than I expected and look really cheap and tacky.
2.0,These socks look good and you might like them if you enjoy hot compression socks.  They are very tight.  I doubt that they are made of the material stated on their Amazon site.  They dont feel like the material. When delivered they do not specify the material.  They also claim you can not return them if you try them on.  Luckily  Amizon gave me a refund.
2.0,Product broke after 3 months....i never got the lanyard either
2.0,Awful! The waist is so tight. They're soft but thin and hold NOTHING in. The waist band cuts in and is so uncomfortable.
2.0,"I love the necklace, but there is a kink in it"
2.0,The dress is entirely too long.
2.0,the material of the luggage is very thin. It feels very flimsy compared to other luggage in this price category. I used it on a road trip from California to Texas and the outside plastic started peeling. If your looking for something affordable look at another option this one is only a matter of time until i break it and it is a disappointment
2.0,"These were comfy the first day, but your foot contours and they get really really big after you start wearing them. They are flip flops and my feet struggle to keep them on so then my foot starts to cramp from clinging to the flip flop as I walk around the house. They are soft, the padding underneath is great, I just wish I had purchased them small since now I can't really wear them."
2.0,Something strange about the way the stripes are attached to the shirt. Makes the fit uncomfortable and cheap looking. Top was easily returned for refund.
2.0,"I was looking for a dress with built in bra padding and there wasn't any in this even though I read some reviews stating there was. Must have bra to wear this, unfortunately."
2.0,Ordered a size up came in 2 sizes smaller than what i ordered.
2.0,Looks way better in the picture.
2.0,Didn't notice much difference with night vision
2.0,too small and I did not like the material
2.0,Not what I was expecting.  The hoop is almost too small to close. I was expecting something a little bigger than this.
2.0,"I did not like this watch as much as I thought I would, seems a little cheap"
2.0,"In the picture, this off-the-shoulder sweater is cute. In real life, not so much. The waffle knit reminds me of long-johns and really doesn’t work with the design of the shirt. A plain cotton knit would be so much better. The shirt runs small too, so size up. The one-shoulder covered, one uncovered with a strap design felt weird, but I’m guessing I’d get used to it as I wore it (which I can’t because it’s too small). Overall not impressed."
2.0,Was going to purchase until I realized that Saturn is in the wrong place.
2.0,"This band barely fits over my mom-hand so I'd say it's not going to work for most American men.<br /><br />It's so small that I'm going to purchase another band, hopefully larger and of higher quality.<br /><br />On the plus side it is cooler to wear than the silicon band that came with my Apple watch.  And the magnet seems to work.<br /><br />One of the interesting things I noticed was that it 'changed' the relative color of my red watch.  With the official 'Product-Red' band my watch looked bright red.  With this band it now looks darker with some bluish hues -- like a wine color.<br /><br />Would work for children or people with very small hands."
2.0,"I loved the color, texture of fabric, and design of dress.  However, it was way too small.  I take a size 12 or a medium usually.  I sized up to a large since it was a brand with which I'm unfamiliar.  I still needed at least 2 inches to close the zipper. I was very disappointed because I really liked the style of the dress.  It made me feel very feminine.  I would have had to get at least a 2x for it to fit properly!  No way!"
2.0,The she is hard to keep straight on your foot.
2.0,It’s longer than 20.  It’s actually almost 21. It’s a bit itchy and color is off for being black
2.0,My heal is on the back edge of the shoe.
2.0,Does not work well.  Disappointed with the product.  Will be returning.
2.0,Got this for a 7 year old thinking it would be the perfect size but it was a bit big. Bigger than the dimensions shown
2.0,"Cute. The color was not what I was expecting though. The toe of the shoe in the picture looks round, but it's very pointy in person. Sizing was a little big, normally I wear a 9, but in this I could have gone with an 8.5. The zipper does not work on one boot so I'm stuck with a pair of boots I can't use and it would cost a fortune to ship them back to china."
2.0,Wires started poking out after only wearing a couple of times.. I would not buy again
2.0,"The top doesn't tighten, just keeps spinning."
2.0,"This is a kid, and I think this product is so fun, but the building material is not so good. My wheel’s rubber kept coming off of the wheel and stoped me from skating. Also, the strap fell apart, and I am writing this to help.<br />Above is from my 10yo son. As the mom who paid for these I think they’re junk. Poorly made and have broken in several places in only 2 months of use. Not worth the money."
2.0,"It seems the sizing on the Internet are kind of on the small size.  In hindsight, I would order either one or two size larger."
2.0,Finally a cycling jersey that runs true to size!
2.0,"I wear a 14/16.  If a garment is a loose fit I can wear a Large, fitted I get an XL.  I ordered the XL in this garment.  To fit comfortably I should have gotten a 2X at least.  It fits like a glove which is not how I want my sleepwear.  I ordered 2 other items from the same manufacturer,  1 was a Large,  the other XL based on previous reviews and both fit perfectly.  It is made well for the price for what that is worth.  Just remember to order up a size or two!"
2.0,"My husband wears a size 10 shoe. I felt considering the description these socks should fit him well, but they are smaller than described. Probably better for a woman than a man's foot."
2.0,Nice fabric but too small for my wife who is a size 4 in the rest of her clothes
2.0,Dress was to small. Ultimately the material albeit stretchy in my opinion was tacky. It snags easily so be mindful of your accessory choices. I returned mine which was an easy process.
2.0,Shoddy stitching. Threads hanging all over the stitch work when unpackaged. Buttons poorly fastened and started to come unstitched after wearing only twice. Both pockets came open at the stitching after only two washings. I would not buy this if you can find another pair of similar shorts for a comparable price. Wish I could return them but the return windows has closed.
2.0,"The boots do fit great,but working 8 hours in my shifts after 2 to 3 hours my toes are hurting so bad and I'm in soooo much pain."
2.0,Not for kids this is adult size
2.0,Really great mask (when it worked).  Within one hour of wearing the mask it died.  Thought it needed new batteries but that wasn't the issue.  Every now and then a brief streak of dim color would appear and then the mask went dark again.  Overall disappointed that I had to spend Halloween with a defective mask.
2.0,The sleeves on this sweater are huge bell sleeves. It would be much cute if they were tapered. Feel like I could fly away.
2.0,beads were falling off ties upon arrival
2.0,I follow the feedback i read to get the next size up but unfortunately doesn't fit right
2.0,"These were cute,  comfortable,  and breakable.  These do not get the Hannah stamp of approval."
2.0,Too big . Size chart not accurate
2.0,Product arrived way smaller than described. Material was thin. Returned.
2.0,"I'm disappointed. I ordered a size 4 and size 7. The shirts are nice. The pants, however, appear to be a different material than the shirts. The pants faded so much after the first wash (on cold cycle) that they no longer match the shirts. Also, the size 7 pants are way too small for my 6 year old, who normally wears a size 7."
2.0,I love the charm but lost its color within a week.
2.0,"Sent them back, Have a wider calf, not for me. Too stiff."
2.0,I ordered a large and it fits nicely. It is more nylon feeling.
2.0,"Glitter out super ruff, & coming off if your one that puts phone in back pocket. Also applied after cleaning phone with rubbing alcohol, let dry 100% & lifting on one side after not long use of liking cards in & out"
2.0,"My 7-year-old son has to wear a mask at school every day, so I wanted to find something reusable.  He loves playing Pac Man and these were marketed as child-size, but they are WAY too large for his face, even with the adjustable ear loops (fits me perfectly, as an adult).  He is very tall for his age and it was still too big.  Also, one of the masks had the metal nose piece on the bottom of the mask, so if he wears it properly, the design on the front is oriented upside down.  I didn't realize it was wrong until after I had already washed them, so I couldn't return them - otherwise, I definitely would have."
2.0,"Pretty but very cheap materials, really thin and flimsy, photo looks better then when it arrives!"
2.0,"Just vinyl on the shirt... that’s a lot of vinyl, makes the shirt feel sticky and not super comfortable to wear."
2.0,I like the style but I work at a bar with high volume and I have had better teeth in other openers it slips off a lot needs a better grip on caps
2.0,Disappointed in the quality of it.  I would only wear this on dog walks period.
2.0,"Flannel is beautiful, but it was sent to me with missing buttons"
2.0,It’s ok they are super small and slim not what I anticipated
2.0,Was not slim fit as advertised more of a relaxed/regular fit returned it after trying it on.
2.0,"my brother likes design, but sweater isnt of good cuality."
2.0,"Although this fanny pack is decently priced, I am very disappointed. It held more than I thought, which was a pleasant surprise, and kept my items dry when it rained unexpectedly (and I got soaked). However, after only one use, both zippers are getting stuck and the inside pocket is already coming apart (see photo). I will not be repurchasing and will be trying to get my money back.<br /><br />If all you need it for is one trip, vacation, festival, etc then it will serve you decently, but don’t expect it to last much longer than that. Very disappointed. Also, be aware of sizing! I am fairly average size I think (I wear a size 10 pant typically) and there was not a whole lot of slack in the waistband. If you are larger than a women’s size 12 or 14 this may not fit or may be very uncomfortable to wear. Better for kids and teens maybe."
2.0,I do like the it but the middle pockets takes a lot of room when you start putting your stuff in it.
2.0,Not what i was looking for
2.0,It looks like a nurses scrub top Very box like Not flattering
2.0,Nice but small. No slouch
2.0,Got shoes with a stain on it not sure what is was. So disappointed. It fits okay though.
2.0,"I was very much on the fence about giving this only one star instead. As shipped, this band was useless. The mechanism used to fasten the new band to the watch would not snap into place, while the band that came with the watch fastened immediately. Tried a few things to make it work, but there was nothing to do. I took a gamble with 5 minutes of my time, and removed the fastening mechanism from the Samsung band and put it on the new Moretek band. It immediately snapped into place.<br /><br />Using the samsung clips results in there being gaps at the center of where the moretek band meets the watch bezel. Not important to me, but it needs to be mentioned.<br /><br />To the good:<br />The band is comfortable, the color is exactly as advertised, and it fits as expected. It's cheap, looks decent (gaps aside), and gets the job done."
2.0,Like the color till it darkened and left black marks on my wrist.
2.0,Runs very small apparently.
2.0,"I love the style and fit but omg this dress is so itchy.. Washing has not helped, I tried wearing a tank top underneath and it helps and pushing up the sleeves but that defeats the purpose of it being long sleeve. So uncomfortable"
2.0,"Very small, already has a rip in the seam for no reason. I'm not a wild person who rips my aprons... Anyway, I do like the pics on the aprons. They are cute, but I am dissapointed."
2.0,"I like them, but one showed up with an obvious hole in the toe. Bad quality control to not have caught it. Otherwise I like them - rubber along the edges prevent them from slipping around, they fit well. Hoping a second set arrive intact."
2.0,"THEY ARE NOT STRETCHY.  THEY ARE SILKY.  DON'T LIKE.  CAN I EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER TOP IF SO I WILL PURCHASE A NUMBER OF STRETCHY XX ROUND NECK LONG SLEEVE STRETCHY TOPS.  I AM 74 AND OFTEN GET CONFUSED WHEN ORDERING, BUT I AM A GREAT CUSTOMER ALWAYS BUYING. JOANNE"
2.0,Just no!!!
2.0,"Was disappointed in the performance of the pack.  Internal support frame kept bending and digging into my lower back, had to keep bending back into position.  Would not buy again."
2.0,Will show your bra through the lace. Will show every outline of everything. Fabric is soooo soft though. Wish this had been nicer.
2.0,They worked great for about a month. Long enough for the refund time to be up and now they don't clasp anymore. My husband loved it while it worked but for the price it should have worked longer.
2.0,These stretch out and fall down... but the grips on the bottom work really well.
2.0,"My daughter picked this backpack out and was so excited to get it and all of the accessories, except that’s not exactly how it happened. It was all packaged neatly but when she opened it the scrunchie and bracelet weren’t included like the packaging said it was supposed to be. We looked in all the pockets of the backpack and in the lunch bag and nothing. She was very upset."
2.0,Pretty disappointed. More articulate dimensions should be offered in the description. These do not fit over my ear lobes. If I'd of had the inside diameter I would not have wasted my money. The product seems to be quality. The problem is a shortfall of the vendor.
2.0,"Of poor quality, I just put it on to test it and it broke immediately, besides it is very small, I am normally L and I have a sissy bust 41 and I ordered XL and it came to me small. the blouse is pretty actually"
2.0,Short and tight
2.0,"Con width of the lenses makes it feel bigger on your face than it needs to be, pros feels sturdy.<br />Unfortunately, I would be getting another one due to this."
2.0,"The case is kind of bulky, not very comfortable, and one of the straps sticks out, so you cannot set it down flat; it has to be on its side which I really do not like. All in all, it seems like it would protect the watch, but I'm only putting it on for special occasions."
2.0,These fit differently than their &#34;space dyed&#34; sock siblings. I do not like these nearly as much. They are a bit too tight around my ankle.
2.0,"Nice look, however was available in full size only.  The size 7 was too large even with heavy socks.  I had to return for a refund."
2.0,"The material of this is gorgeous and the color, as well. The suit, however, is too short for anyone on the taller side. I'm 5'8&#34; (not actually considered &#34;tall&#34; yet) and it was a few inches too short. Very disappointed because this suit was everything I was looking for in regards to style and feel."
2.0,"Really disappointed in quality of the dress and overall fit.  The lining itself is totally sheer, the lace somewhat hides that, but not much.  Dress was too short, the edges have fray which sort of looks like it should be there, but sort of doesn't.  Returning the item, cannot wear for intended use which was my bridal shower."
2.0,Disappointing purchase. Definitely not the quality shirts and print I've bought previously from Amazon. Text is small on a larger shirt and not easily readible except the word WOMEN. The print will likely not stand up to multiple washing. Additionally this is not a suitable shirt for a big and tall man. Shirt was not long enough for my tall husband despite ordering a 3x. This was a disappointing gift.
2.0,In order for this thing that fit my head I'm going to have to wear a hat inside it or get it sewn a little smaller.  It feels like it would be very warm though
2.0,Cardigan is bulky in shape and stiff/itchy. It is uncomfortable and unflattering.
2.0,Cute dress design but cheaply made. Sent back.
2.0,Did not fit Gerber onsies
2.0,"I ordered the rich red COACH Women's Gloveton Leather Saddle Bag which is GORGEOUS.  The leather is beautiful and I love the thicker straps attached to the handbag.  Lots of pockets and a great handbag,  I think this is one of the nicer designed handbags that COACH makes.  Definitely looks quality.<br /><br />Post comment.  The red was gorgeous indoors, but when I took it outdoors it looked more like a dark hot pink.  Returning it because of color, not the quality.  Too bad."
2.0,Cheap made. Very thin.
2.0,Much smaller on top and pattern stretches out
2.0,"I was looking for boots for my wonder woman costume and after a fail try at the official wonder woman boots I decided to get these. They came within 2 days which was great! Unfortunately they are too small! I'm a size 6 and though i could fit my foot in the shoe they feel entirely too small because the toe is too narrow. The tongue of the shoe is also very narrow and small. These are great for people with bigger calves because they lace up. I would definitely order a size up if you buy these. They don't seem very durable though. All in all, I would not repurchase these."
2.0,"I really like the length of the dress, I'm 5' 6&#34; and it drags but I can wear heels. I ordered XL and the top portion is tight, I'm a 36c and wear a medium/large shirt. I'm really disappointed that the dress looks to have pockets with the model but none on the dress"
2.0,"Although it heats and arrived on time, my father is 5’9 and weighs 140 pounds. I purchased him an extra large to wear over sweatshirts. He cannot even zip it because it is so small. A family friend who is a size 6 woman barely could get it to zip around her."
2.0,I bought the large and it was way to small and the skirt too short
2.0,"I loved the color and texture of this braided band! Unfortunately a week or so into wearing it with my Apple Watch SE the plastic mechanism holding it to my watch face broke. Would buy again if they could fix the flimsy elements connecting the watch face to the band, wish it would have lasted longer!"
2.0,"Wrong size, poorly made, thick, dye wears off.  I ordered a 21mm and got a 19mm?  Poor quality control.  I would never buy this again. The photos look 10x better than the actually band. I would not feel so bad if I knew that the purchase of this poorly made watch band went to a good cause or supported fair labor.  However I can not even confirm this was not made under poor labor conditions. Avoid... pay more for a true quality band."
2.0,"Too shiny silvery, looks so fake."
2.0,"Ordered this for my husband since he had a metal one and wanted one that would be more work friendly with a watch clasp closure.  He works outside everyday and unfortunately he said it hasn't helped him.  We ordered this based on the style and function, but are disappointed.  Save your money."
2.0,"Returning this one - it has a weird fit around the waist and hips, just not flattering on me."
2.0,"There was a hole in one of the pockets as soon as I opened the pack, and the pants are super super thin material"
2.0,"This a really big wallet, it felt more like a woman's wallet than a man, at least to me, and it comes from overseas so it will take longer to get it, I didn't like this wallet at all.....I think I would like to know if it is coming from overseas."
2.0,Every time I wash this clothe I need to use a razor to remove the lint all over the place.
2.0,"The color bleeds and fades, the pads aren’t sewed in and slide around the bra in the way, you can take them out, but it’s hard to get them back in without them falling apart. They are comfortable though."
2.0,"Very small stud, Even can’t hold them properly"
2.0,Very cheap material. I bought this for a last minute event. Hoping I can get it altered to make it look/fit better.
2.0,Don’t care for shirt
2.0,THE BACK PART OF THE SHOE RUBS AGAINST DAUGHTER'S HEEL AND CAUSES BLISTERS
2.0,Runs way small. Kiddo had already torn into the packaging before I realized so can't be returned.
2.0,Sooo I like it but doesn’t fit my wrist it fits my 5 year old son. So I would honestly not buy again
2.0,"These glasses are not red, is colored magenta, or pink, any of these colors less red, i dont like it"
2.0,"It's alright, but it's super thin. Not worth over $10 imo."
2.0,Not flattering nor good fit. Too tight. Go up a size or two .
2.0,There is too much give in this wallet so is looks awkward and misshapen. Also then keys can push in  to the material and puncture it and your credit cards.
2.0,"These were a gift, so I don't have a review"
2.0,"The belt loops are by the knees, I ordered a replacement and same issue"
2.0,"The pants are really nice.  However, I ordered a 10 because the reviews said they run small.  The pants I received said XL in the tag and did not fit.  I ordered another pair in size 12 and the second pair I received also said XL in the tag.  This second pair fit better than the first but they are &#34;technically&#34; the same size.  I attempted to return the first pair and the cost to return to China was almost the same as the cost of the pants.  This was confusing as I ordered via Prime and got free shipping.  If you can find a pair that fit on the first order, you will end up with a great pair of pants.  But, if not you are stuck."
2.0,"Nice replacement but doesn't have the dark orange reflection in the curve of the lease like the originals, or for that matter the photo posted. They're still good, but not the same."
2.0,"These are sturdy sandals which are perfect for my very active 2 year old.  But the strap across the toe on one sandal is not aligned right and his toes keep popping out no matter how we tighten the strap.  If there wasn’t that problem, these would be great, sturdy sandals for him to wear this summer!"
2.0,They are cute but I thought they where adjustable I must hadn't paid attention to the full description. They  where a bit uncomfortable to me because they where not adjustable just stretchy .
2.0,It seems like the size chart isn't the same for us in the USA.
2.0,I think I would have liked them if they were true to size. I returned them.
2.0,"I ordered a small because it corresponded to what I normally wear but it does not cover my chest AT ALL. If you have large breasts I highly recommend ordering a size (or maybe two?) larger than normal. My boobs are completely sticking out the sides of the shirt, it's like I'm not even wearing anything in the front.  However, the fabric is awesome, amazing material for working out, but unfortunately I have to return it for a bigger size. Hopefully a medium or large will cover the girls."
2.0,One of the masks is ripped!
2.0,"3pk of bottems, looks like u got me - trouble is they're 2nds in the pack. Try harder 2 b better next time.<br /><br />BT,<br />L-moe"
2.0,Sizing is way off order up 3 sizes larger if you plan on fitting it
2.0,"Pant lengths do not match, poor quality."
2.0,"This cape fit just fine as it was stated in the description it will fit size small to xl, but I ordered the &#34;pure white&#34; and when i got it it was not pure white at all more of an eggshell or an off white almost a cream color. I was very disappointed because I got this cape for an attention piece to accompany my pure white gloves and now they do not match."
2.0,"This jacket fit well and from afar it looked great. However, I’m returning it because - at conversation distance - the fabric looked ‘cheap’. I have happily worn other things by this designer, but was disappointed in this."
2.0,Too heavy to wear.
2.0,"This pair of shoes developed holes on the top of each shoe with minimal wear in a very short amount of time.  After 30 days and contacting this company about the defect, I was left with no adjustment, replacement, or reimbursement.  Definitely a no for the shoes and a no for this company.  Defective merchandise should be replaced, no questions asked."
2.0,Too big<br />Material is too hard
2.0,Sad that it was very sheer and thin material and didn’t zip all the way up. I’m a 14-16 women’s and got XL but it was too small and I worried about the zipper breaking because it’s not the sturdiest. Overall it’s a cute dress but didn’t work out.
2.0,Love the bag. Not sure why they would send me a strap that looks like it's been cut in half.
2.0,"As others have mentioned, the fabric quality is questionable at best.<br /><br />After a few washing and drying cycles the fabric appears to be damaged.<br /><br />I guess you could always air dry to be safe but kind of an inconvenience."
2.0,"i like it but digital part doesnt work at all, no event light but its ok, i mean for the price is ok i think even so i would not buy one again"
2.0,"I know I can purchase these at a much lower price from USA sources and even less from China directly. I needed some in a hurry and they offered quick 2 day shipping. I thought maybe these were a superior product so I took a chance since there are no reviews. Well they were delivered timely, that is why I gave them two stars. These are sourced from China. The tips of the shoelaces I am using with these barely fit through the holes. If I knew what I know now, I would have bought from a different supplier to get the same quality at a MUCH lower price. I can not recommend these unless you are desperate to get something in two days."
2.0,"I love the fit of everything, except the breast part (I spill over embarrassingly). I wasn't expecting this in the size I bought (plus size)."
2.0,"They are nice quality, but no two pair are the same size. Completely useless for the price."
2.0,Cute shirt too small
2.0,"The vest is nicer than expected. The product description in the title for the grouping clearly says Fedora Hat. There is no Fedora Hat. The arm bands are too small for any man with even a  a hint of arm muscle. The bow tie is only for very skinny necked men, more like boys size. In the interest of time we will make the costume accessories work."
2.0,Very cheaply made looks like it was made out of a plastic bag! I was very disappointed!
2.0,Scratches very easily and the color and quality of lenswas not satisfactory. Also fitment was not perfect.
2.0,"Way too small. More pencil skirt than A-line. The fabric is not great quality and it smells icky, but those things I can tolerate at this price point. The terrible sizing and misrepresentation of cut however are deal breakers for me."
2.0,They are too small I have 13 size foot there's noway these socks were going on..the socks are designed good but they are not easy to put on..im alittle disappointed that advertised that
2.0,"I found the size ran big for me. I typically wear a small to medium and I chose to order a small...it fit like a large. The material is really thin and I wish it wasn’t pleated, it makes the stitching seem off. The elastic had shifted too and I had to get it back into place.<br /><br />Ultimately I decided not to bother returning it. I like the print a lot and it will look cute with cut offs or leggings. If it came smaller I would order another size down. That being said I would suggest skipping this or ordering with caution."
2.0,Felt the item was not new. I didnt notice it when I received.
2.0,"Could smell it even before I opened the package , Hung it in the garage for 4 days , still smelled , soaked it in water and hung outside for 3 days , damn thing still smells . Good belt if you can get over the overpowering smell !"
2.0,Broke after one month an a half out use.
2.0,I like the style of the dress but the material--- no. What in the world were they thinking. You can wear it around the house but PLEASE do NOT go outside with it. NO!
2.0,Runs 2 small. I'd suggest going one size up.
2.0,Took long to get and they didn't fit right
2.0,Very small and ruffles look dented in/don’t hold shape
2.0,"I wore them 3 times and now they are faded in spots, other then that they fit as expected and they were the exact color I needed"
2.0,"Pretty ring, but sadly the lettering broke the second day I wore it.  I had to return it."
2.0,"Print was blurry and it was dry fit and thin which the picture is misleading, because it looks like cotton"
2.0,I wear a 2x but this was way too big and so not flattering. I ended up returning it.
2.0,Beautiful and warm but runs 3 sizes small.
2.0,"This blouse is not as pictured or described. I purchased a red one (different brand) that looked exactly like this and I love it.  This fabric is not chiffon, it is too long, much too large even though I ordered the same size as I usually wear.  I returned the blouse."
2.0,I did not like it. The material wasn't supple and not as spacious as indicated. I'm sending it back
2.0,I took one look at this and said nope. I have it to my not even half my size Daughter and it fits perfect.  Sad thing is I bought the largest size and my daughter is a small
2.0,Pretty dress but runs small.  Order 1-2 sizes up if you don't want a very tight reveling fit.
2.0,"The color is silver or light grey not the color shown.  The straps are very narrow, also not as shown.  I am returning the dress."
2.0,"It fitted a lil too long for me, I am short so it looked weird on me."
2.0,"The chain  looks good, but the size isn't what they say it is, that's the main reason that i chose this one, its all about the size, dont buy it thinking that you will get the size you chosed."
2.0,"I loved my fun Melissas until they began to separate at different points in the rose design. How disappointing, as they are not an inexpensive jelly shoe. The separation is quite noticeable, unfortunately, as it causes the rubber to gape at the arch and outer ankle where the separation has occurred."
2.0,It was cute for my sons Homecoming. He wore it for about 3 hours before he tried to adjust it and it broke.
2.0,Junk... at the second time I put into the charger did not work.... I had to change the battery from each foot to get it.. its so hard...really upset..
2.0,"You probably know the sound when your feet stick to the sandals as you walk. Well, these make that sound ALL THE TIME. I tried them without putting them on and if you squeeze the foot-bed, it makes that sound without having them on.<br /><br />Using other words, it sounds as if the foot-bed is delaminating from the out-sole; and that's in the first few days.<br /><br />I recommend that anyone going for sandals try Crocs in place of these."
2.0,"This item felt so cheap, I was worried it would fall apart in the washer. I'm returning it."
2.0,Socks looked awesome. But smell horrible after wearing them. Definitely a shame for how good they look.
2.0,I got a size smaller and it's still to big!! It's a very pretty top..
2.0,A 2xl is probably an XL size. Runs small.
2.0,Not made for anyone with a D size. Had to return
2.0,"I like the fit around my waist and hips. The ankle is not fitted, like the pic, it's very wide. In fact, it's not even a solid ankle, it is an open slit/flap of 7 inches. So when you walk, it opens and moves. Not what I wanted."
2.0,"Thanks to all the previous reviewers who helped me manage my expectations and make my selection. I'm 5'7&#34;, 150 lbs, 36D. I ordered a XL because I don't like tight fitting clothing. The unlaundered dress, layed flat, measured: shoulder 15.5&#34;, bust 20.75&#34;, waist 19.5&#34;, hips 22&#34;. See pics. For me the shoulders and sleeves were a good fit. If they were any smaller, they would have been too tight. I liked that the sleeves were long enough. The body on the otherhand was one size too large, especially the hips. The crooked kangaroo pocket was the deal-breaker on this dress. It was 1 inch lower on one side than it was on the other! See pics. It looks and feels odd. This dress will never see the outside of my house. I was hoping for a dress to wear in the classroom, but this is just a junky housedress."
2.0,The earrings are beautiful - found only one would stay closed. It kept following out.
2.0,Photo is deceiving. Hood is lined with wool but jacket is not. Very thin material. Photo makes it look like a jacket that can be worn outdoors. It is not. It is a very light hooded cardigan.
2.0,"This piece would have been cute except for two things.. 1.) The bottom stretchy part didn't stretch very much so it was very hard to get on  and 2.) The breast coverage didn't cover very well. The sides were exposed too much.  And if you're going to do yoga in it, you'd probably be falling out. Not a good sports bra imo."
2.0,Seams are irregular. Feels more synthetic than true silk.
2.0,"Almost love this, but the line is fine! Great concept, average quality. The convenience of snap twisting the phone on and off the armband is awesome. However the tabs that hold the phone coberbare plastic so wear and tear eventually tear them apart, rendering the armband and cover useless. Perhaps aluminum would have been better"
2.0,Broke after a few wears
2.0,These boots are the smallest size 8 I have ever purchased.
2.0,"They came damaged and had to be thrown out. One earring was in two pieces, and the second one the back was bent. I know they are cheap.... But I expected to be able to wear them at least once. No such luck."
2.0,Really cute top but it’s cut so far off the bias that it twists from top the bottom. The bottom of the center design ends up on my waist.
2.0,"I got a XL , I just don’t like they roll up and don’t stay put , so I’m not all satisfied with it"
2.0,"Foot is too short, leg is too short and won’t stay up. Compression at arch doesn’t seem tight enough."
2.0,18K gold my ass! This was cheap and broke in like a month. It was stiff and plastic.
2.0,Not warm or water proof. Practically see-through.
2.0,The strings began to unravel on one of the bracelets almost immediately. The colors are great.
2.0,"I wore this necklace for a couple weeks and was complimented on it every single day. Unfortunately, it broke within a month of my purchasing it. Nothing happened, it just fell off my neck and the clasps fell apart and detached from the chain."
2.0,Very large in size
2.0,"The problem with these bottles isn't the bottles; they are the spray nozzles, which have only two settings; heavy single line of spray or heavy (non-fine) spray. Neither of which work for cosmetic use. If these are strictly for non-cosmetic use, I guess they're okay. If they are in any for cosmetic use, unless you want a ""splash"" in the face, go elsewhere."
2.0,I usually love skirts like this but the shorts ride up constantly making it truly uncomfortable to wear.  Very disappointed.
2.0,The quality of these aren’t bad at all other than the sizing is off! I ordered a 3x since I just had surgery and needed extra room but these are more like a 14/16 size . But warning XXX: company will make you jump through hoops to return them and won’t refund if you don’t follow orders !!!
2.0,"The minute the wind blows so does the hat, and that could be dangerous crossing the street!"
2.0,Too small!! Reordered a larger size. Love the style!
2.0,"Not good.  Low quality but I guess you get what you pay for. The nose piece is extremely sharp.  The swim cap was so thin it was translucent and broke at first attempted use.  (I've been swimming for years, I know how to put on a swim cap)."
2.0,Came with a damaged zipper was missing 1 or 2 of the teeth
2.0,The mask is pretty comfortable but super large for my face when I was working out I felt the fabric coming into my mouth so it made it way harder to be through my Work out both through my mouth and my nose which defeat the purpose of my purchase but I do you use them just to go shopping and they’re pretty easy to wash
2.0,"Super pretty but way to small, I need size 16-18g and that's what I paid for but I can't even get it into my nose because of how tiny it is.<br />**Edit** To get it in I had to use pliers to make the opening bigger than use pliers to close it when in my nose. The ball isn't hard to get snapped in place, the only issue is how tiny it is to where you have to open and close it with pliers. Other than that it's pretty and durable."
2.0,"I bought these to block blue light because I suffer from chronic migraines. They do not help. No screen or any light coming through these lenses feels any easier on the eyes. In fact, the lenses appear to be slightly magnified, which, since unexpected, gave me a headache after only five minutes of wear. I do not need magnified lenses and would not have bought them had I known.<br /><br />They get two stars instead of one for being stylish. I will probably pop the lenses out of these and try to repurpose them."
2.0,"My daughter ordered this, and I know it's an inexpensive watch, but it came without a battery, I had to go to a jeweler to get it off, and when the battery was installed, the hands jittered and it didn't keep accurate time.  Obviously, it's possible she got a bad one, so I didn't give it one star, but it still is about as much a watch as the price indicates."
2.0,I’m wearing medium size always and I ordered Medium and large but non of them fited
2.0,"I didn't like this shirt, the sleeve shoulders pouffed out and it wasn't very good quality"
2.0,"Too small waist, legs are a bit more bigger.<br />Over it's okay."
2.0,"I know in the product description it mentions that the saddles were smaller than the norm, But c’mon! While I may not have paper thin ear lobes, I absolutely know that they are not on the thicker side.  I can live with the fact that these are  on the thinner side as far as gauges go,  but that coupled with the fact that the saddle is ridiculously shallow causes my plugs to pop out If I scratch my ear or if I shake my head too hard even. I purposely don’t wear them at night so as to give them a slightly tighter fit during the day. The other brands of gauges I’ve worn at this same size (9/16”)  I have not had anywhere near this degree of problem with. I think the design choice on their end is more in line with saving on material costs rather than a conscious aesthetic design decision. It really is a huge shame because the stone quality in the pieces seems top-notch, it’s just the shape that causes all of the problems."
2.0,Color faded after the one use.
2.0,My 3 year old daughter picked this out for her Halloween costume.  Saying this goes up to 4T is pretty out of line.  It hardly fits her and she is swimming in 4T clothes
2.0,The beads were almost all solid not showing the inner beauty of the beads. Without that opening they are just a mat tan bead.
2.0,Run small would like to exchange for a bigger size
2.0,"Poor quality, has no shape"
2.0,Patty but won’t stay put in my ear
2.0,"This product is extremely thin, it will be okay for occasional use but don't expect it to be your every day suit! Also, the sizing is horrible, I typically wear a size 18 and bought the XXXL which says it's a 14/16 and its loose. I won't bother retuning it but I'm very &#34;meh&#34; about it."
2.0,Runs small and very snug.
2.0,Disappointed in quality!!!
2.0,I had picked out a pair to put on my slim/natural 5T daughter and instantly stretched at the inner inseam to about a 1/2inch whole. Needless to say they are unusable.<br />The rest of them are tight and difficult to put on. I love the idea and thickness of them.<br />2 out of 3 negative
2.0,The cubic came off
2.0,"Small, thin & cheap."
2.0,"I loved the look of these on the picture but they ring part is way too long, so i constantly have to adjust it so that it looks decent.  The jewels stay in place very well and do not get faded with wear.  Overall I would not purchase again unless maybe I was pregant and needed a longer ring ."
2.0,Comfortable BUT would’ve been great if the lens wasn’t scratched :(
2.0,"POorly made. Putting it on wasn't a problem, but it kept falling within the crotch area which was weird"
2.0,Look Very cheap but can be worn
2.0,"Okay so don't get me wrong, they are absolutely so adorable and I am happy with them..... but I'm pretty dissapointed that basically every single one either has the paint messed up or the metal hoop isn't even at the top and is angled. I hate leaving bad reviews, they are definetly super cute! I just can't do what I wanted to do with them"
2.0,"Did not like these, nothing against the product."
2.0,Seems like a nice quality shirt. Very form fitting. Not too complimenting unless you’ve got a six pack..
2.0,"I love the buckle mechanism, but the belt quality won't make many years. Mine is already cracked. See photos."
2.0,Pretty color. Material is VERY thin.
2.0,The black bands get this weird dusty layer that u constantly have to be wiping or like little specks of dust no matter where u at so basically the rubber from the band sucks.
2.0,"This ankle bracelet was cute enough, but horrible quality!  I have other ankle bracelets that I have spent similar amount on and they have lasted literally 3 years with never taking them off.  This one broke in 2 days!!!  Just wearing shorts and sandals, nothing over it like socks/boots/shoes and the darn thing broke pretty much right away!  It broke right in half!!  Come on people, lets get some better quality control!  I realize this item isnt expensive, but I at least expected it to last for more than 2 days!!!  Not happy, dont buy this one gals!!!  Only gave 2* instead of one because it is cute, but could not have been more cheap!  Do not recommend!!"
2.0,Material is too light in texture. Length is not long enough. Rather disappointed to say the least.
2.0,I'm tiny all around and this is a thong on me not cute and flowy very disappointed  quality is decent for price for the money if the thing fit me
2.0,Magnets stink on these. Hard to pry apart to put on but then falls to various places on your ears
2.0,"Hat is very lightweight. It doesn't look as if it would repel much rain.  Sadly, I returned it."
2.0,did not like the fit.  had to return
2.0,"Way to small, sheer and too revealing."
2.0,"These are shorter than any other boxer briefs I have purchased.  The material is very thin and tends to bunch up from the bottom and roll down from the top.  They fit (I am 6'3&#34; with a 32 inch waist), but are not comfortable due to the bunching up.  Would not buy these again."
2.0,What’s the point of a light if it’s too dim? Can’t tell the time at night! Fine in all other respects.
2.0,"The material of this product is really cheap and plastic like, it does not fit in a comfortable way and it looks tacky, i do not recommend buying this product."
2.0,I love the quality I love the design but the only thing that keeps me from wearing it day today is that they need to make something on the chain where the infinity and the Shiba part lock in place. In another words the chain chokes you because the weight of the Shiba  part goes down and infinity goes to your neck making it a choker Necklace
2.0,"Didn't really work for me. Thought to be fair, I suck at facepainting. Thought it was too dry, and when I added a bit of water too wet, not thick enough"
2.0,Paper design around the earring peels off easily.
2.0,"Heavy, metal arms bent, silicone nosepads smell like chemical. Nowhere near as polished as Fost**Gr****. Returned immediately"
2.0,I had to return. It was too big for my taste.
2.0,"Received the product today, stitching is off, corners are not cut symmetrically, not a premium quality product, I would keep looking for a leather keychain."
2.0,Looks more like a smock then a dressy top in person.
2.0,"I like the concept of the dress and the idea of the animal print, but what I didn’t like was what the dress was made from. It did not feel like fabric, it felt more like what cheap dime store umbrellas are made from. Kind of a stiff plastic feeling fabric. Super weird"
2.0,"Did not come with free face protector as advertised. Also, the watch squeaks at the hinges when moving it around. I personally did not care for it."
2.0,This was not at all like the picture...was not two strands or long...just one strand..I am NOT happy with the purchase..
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:ed6a77204ce3c4fe177a9e2e495b2882]] I bought this a while back and was beautiful just as the picture. But it’s looked like this for a while too. It changes colors. It’s not silver, and will turn your finger green. As I wore it for long period of time, my finger stopped turning green. But it’s changed to weird colors, & don’t look at all, as nice as when I got it! 4$ is deff not bad, so I cannot<br />cannot complain about the price. But the ring is VERY short lasting so you decide, but will not last being beautiful."
2.0,"Day 1, already starting to tarnish"
2.0,The masks are very small! May be good for a child. For me it barely reached from the tip of my nose to just over the edge of my chin. When I opened t mouth to speak it slipped off my nose completely.
2.0,This just fits weird. It is baggy in the weirdest places making it very unflattering. The sleeves are shorter than I would like and I have pretty short arms. I wore this once and gave it away to a friend because otherwise it would have collected dust in my closet. It was very uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,"This was waaayyy too large for my 12.2lb 2 1/2 month old. I chose 0-3 months and even the skirt was loose on her and would fall off if I helped her stand. The onesie just swallowed her so much you couldn’t read the text from it hanging off her body, lol. This would probably fit a 3-6 month old better than a 0-3 month old.  That being said, the outfit itself is adorable and I would have LOVED it if it had actually fit. Now I’m hoping I can order another and it will actually fit, and that it gets here before Valentine’s."
2.0,Washed once and the letters began falling off. Always careful to follow directions on tag. Fot well and a cute shirt but not worth the price for one wear.
2.0,I bought these for my son and within the 1st time wearing them they started coming apart. He has worn each pair maybe twice and has to throw them out.
2.0,"I have been wearing this size for quite a while, and I like my shorts a little loose.  I couldn't even get these all the way up.  I returned them."
2.0,Okay so I bought this for my husband. We did not expect the hidden pocket to be so large or that it would as low as his crotch. Not convinient to have important document get so low you have to dig it out of your private wares. The fit was nice so he used it as regular underwear but to hold anything it was I convinient.
2.0,Way too thin and to small to be useful
2.0,These are really cute but only lasted 3 wears before one of the shoes broke. I know theyare inexpensive but I did Expect them to last at least a few months.
2.0,This product was not the design I ordered. The embroidered emblems shown in the pictures on the site were missing when the product arrived.
2.0,I love the bag. The design is super cute. I’m frustrated because the zipper inside the matching wallet was busted the day I took it out of the package. I hate to go through the whole return process.
2.0,It’s. Nice as expected just can’t move cause it pishes u together really good
2.0,"There is no way they would fit a teenager as listed. They were very tight on my 10 year old. They pulled his ears forward when he tried them on. They also had a stinky smell. That would probably wash out, but I'm returning."
2.0,I bought these after an ablation and Phlebectomy to wear to work. I was searching for something more opaque that I could wear under my scrubs but didn’t need anything to go over them before changing at work. I found by lunch time they were nearly unbearable. The mesh like texture of the fabric dug into my skin and the thickness of the tight felt like constant bunching behind my knee. I was constantly readjusting as it had created a pressure point. I don’t recommend wearing these with underwear it is lined with shorts. They were too long and bunched at my ankle. I am 5’5 and bought a large - I have thicker legs so the medium would have been too small. I found they were also really hot! I work at a surgery center - they keep it cool - but was roasting all day in these.
2.0,Once it it sized there is no adjustment available. Almost to wide for my jeans.
2.0,Description of band was leather...I really don’t think it was.<br />Great look alike for the new Hermès but not worth keeping because of the quality of the strap
2.0,A tank top bit NOT a compression top.
2.0,I really did like the cut of the item
2.0,They are made of great material. But they run almost a size and half too small. XXXL is almost an XL
2.0,"Fit is nice, but &#34;waterproof&#34; is a bit of a stretch. You will be soaked through in any sort of a rain other than a very light drizzle."
2.0,Disappointed by the color. Wanted dark green and they were light green.
2.0,it was too small and I would like to return it.
2.0,I thought these would be small lobe hugging earrings...the post is thick and WAAAYYY too long for an ear piercing and the dangle part was huge and looks like something u would use to hang something up with a nail on a wall with...
2.0,It fell apart in less than a month. Not worth sending back for the money.
2.0,I ordered this necklace and it came in gold not silver!!!  Now I will NEVER wear it!  Very disappointing!
2.0,"Bigger than expected. To me, it seemed a good gift for a little girl."
2.0,Sunglass storage bag Was not included in my shipment I was very disappointed I did not get the storage bag with my sunglasses as you Advertise
2.0,Color is beautiful BUT I am a plus sized female size 18 and this barely fits my size 1 daughter.  She said she would take it or it definitely would have been returned.  There are few seams; sleeve edges are cut but no hem-as is the bottom ruffles.  Cheaply made.  She plans to wear it around the house only.
2.0,black part was too short
2.0,The print pictured is not what I ordered. Highly disappointed. I ordered because they looked feminine and they send me dark greens and masculine looking colors. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because of tightness. I am using these as face masks so they stay flush to the face without having to pull them up.
2.0,"It's ok. Arrived smelling HEAVILY of chemicals (made me cough when I opened the shipping envelope), will def need to be washed before use. The color is not nearly as vibrant as the photos show, has a darkish muddy look to it. Almost like the dyes ran together so you can't see the details that probably prompted you to purchase it. Haven't worn it yet, debating on returning it because it is really not like the photos at all. Not as cute as it should be my camera makes it look way better."
2.0,Good product though the length at which it stops makes me look like I have cankles and it does not fit tightly. It is a little loose. That doesn’t matter too much but what does is the seams in the crotch becomes undone. :(
2.0,Yeah it's cute and the quality is ok but the buttons down the front are so far spaced you can't wear it for pajamas without wearing clothes underneath or your goodies will peek out. It should've been disclosed that it doesn't zip shut like every other sleep onsie. It's much more suited for a costume than pajamas
2.0,It was cut small although I ordered a size up
2.0,I liked color but shirt pictured is misleading its not shaped like on picture
2.0,"The coat is gorgeous, BUT while wearing it for the very first time, the stitching was coming undone in both pockets. There was loose thread everywhere! I was dissatisfied and disappointed because this coat was over $500.00"
2.0,"I love the actual design of it, but on the first day the letters already started to peel off."
2.0,The strap fits a littlw weird
2.0,"These socks are huge!  Nice length, but are far too wide and bunch up in the foot, angle, and lower calf area. The top fits nice, and looks good sticking out of the top of the boot."
2.0,Programs easily but range is poor. Old remotes worked from 100m as we approached garage. These have to be 25m from door so need to wait for door to open.
2.0,Cute but very flimsy-
2.0,"Have not worn this blazer because it's too small. I ordered a large, but it fits like a medium. Order Up!"
2.0,Durability isn’t great
2.0,"Too big at the base...maybe a good maternity shirt, but it fits strangely"
2.0,"Did not like the material. It was too light and clingy. 5'10&#34; size 14, and it fell above the ankle. I returned it."
2.0,The pants are very tight and not true to size
2.0,"The bifocal is very low & small area.  I do have a small face and while the glasses fit okay, I had to lift the frames up to be able to read out of bifocal portion."
2.0,Very small. Ordered one size up from measured size but still too small. Don't think that will order bigger size. Better order something different.
2.0,It's kinda okay but the pendant holder broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,Great walking shoes but they squeak
2.0,"This was a cute dress but it was way too big for my petite frame. Sadly, I had to return it. If this came out in a much smaller size, I would buy it in a heartbeat."
2.0,It's pretty but it is way to small. It's more the size for a teen.
2.0,I only wanted the bungee cords. Had to buy the entire tie down system. Expensive!
2.0,The pendant constantly falls off chains. The clasp that holds it on is very weak.
2.0,"Bought as a gift and thought they'd be smaller.  But, they are very sparkly, not too heavy but might be too heavy for some if you aren't used to big earrings."
2.0,The hooks are not well made. Do not stay together.  Will be sending back.
2.0,Pant and shirt combo is cute but sizing is off. The shirt is soft and fits my 2 year old perfect but the jumper/pants are very thin and too short in the torso. The jumper/pants being short in the torso make the dimensions look really off. Wouldn't order again. For reference my toddler is average weight and height according to current statisics.
2.0,"It doesn't look like an actual dress, it looks like a night robe. There is no way this would be appropriate to wear anywhere other than at home."
2.0,The sleeves were too short and it didn’t fit like one pictured
2.0,Really cute but it came broken. The clasp wouldn’t even open. Had to return. So sad
2.0,"very cute, ordered a large. absolutely did not fit. i normally wear a medium. disappointed."
2.0,"Usually great watches! This is my second one, as I lost my first. The backlight doesn’t work on this one!!"
2.0,"Earrings were darling but so tiny. Very disappointed at the smallness. As pictured they looked larger and longer, will keep  though!"
2.0,"An XL did not fit.  I am a 40D. I prefer 100% cotton.  Didn't realize this was all nylon.  Fine for others maybe,  but not for me."
2.0,don't like the material at all!
2.0,I bought other similar dresses from Amazon that fit much better than this one. The waist is in an awkward place. It’s too high but not high enough to be an empire waist.
2.0,"The design of the dress is nice but it looks very cheap, especially with the metal ring. I normally love Homeyee dresses but this was not one of their best dresses."
2.0,the screw came out . could be made a bit better
2.0,Nice sweater but runs small
2.0,Good material but runs really small. Ordered a XL and fits like a medium
2.0,Too small for my 9yr old boy and 12 yr old girl. Perhaps may fit a 4yr old which really doesn't need one.
2.0,"Looked great, but strap broke with first use."
2.0,No stretch and almost like table cloth material from like table cloths from the 1900’s lol
2.0,Not sweatshirt material. Very thin.
2.0,Can't put the charm on the necklace. Opening isn't wide enough. Nice necklace but super disappointing that I'm going to have to do extra before I can actually wear it.
2.0,one pair only has 1 earring in it..I did write to them but haven't heard back
2.0,"I had high hopes for this product but was ultimately disappointed.  While the buckle is heavy and of very good quality the actual belt material is light weight and, on the belt I received, was damaged from being clamped by the heavier buckle.  Everything still works but the edges of the belt continue to get chewed up by the buckle and everything does not operate smoothly.  Similarly, the end cap on the belt is not a good match with the lightweight canvas material.  My advice is to try another manufacturer."
2.0,Nothing like the picture.  Not happy with the look at all.
2.0,Don’t stay clipped to pants. Seller easy to work with.
2.0,It smells weird.  Poor material.
2.0,Dress was gorgeous it fit me beautifully. My problem was the corset backing goes far beyond the bodice. It laces down about half way to your bum. My bum caused the bottom of the corset to bunch up and it made me look like I had a tail. It seems such a long corset backing would only work for someone who does not have a well endowed backside. Besides that I loved it. I wish it worked out for me. Ended up returning it. Seller was attentive and understanding.
2.0,this watch came in  with not only a  different  design but a  broken belt.  the belt was  literally  peeling  into  two  pieces.  plus the face  was not  as pictured.  though  the seller  did personally apologize
2.0,"Says if you want a relaxed fit, buy one size larger. Yet they are described in the title as relaxed fit. What they mean to say is THEIR SIZE CHART IS WRONG. My husband always wears a 40.  Relaxed fit ?  HARDLY. He could not get the zipper up at all they run so small.  Really a pain and a waste of time unless you read all the reviews and know ahead of time... the seller isn't telling you."
2.0,"Set is colorful and bright.  However, the print is like a paint print rather than thread design. Which means it comes off after a few washes and disappointed my 5 year old real bad!  Hours of crying because his favorite engine print was coming off 😒"
2.0,"Absurdly small,  can't even use.  The medium might fit my 4 year old"
2.0,These shoes were very chunky. The overall look was bigger than typically crocs. Not satisfied so I ended up returning.
2.0,Very inconvenient where the buttons and not fit like I see on the website
2.0,"I ordered a size 11 for men’s, there is no possible way this could be a men’s 11. No mans foot is as narrow as this. Seriously compared to other shoes this is a women’s. Don’t buy if you are a man."
2.0,Cheap in price and quality. Since these are something you will rarely have an occasion to wear I would get a nicer one for when you DO have a reason to wear it.
2.0,too sort
2.0,Too small. Not stretchy. Took almost a month too come. It’s good as a nightgown though.
2.0,Poor quality. Pants look nice but are very thin material. Was a Christmas gift and pants ripped after only a few washes.
2.0,"Returned the ring, from pictures I thought it would look delicate and intricate, in reality looks small and chunky. Nothing wrong with it, just not my style."
2.0,"They were supposed to help with the temperature of your hands, but my hands still felt very cold. They also made it difficult to use a keyboard and touch screen. They felt too big in my hands to where the controller was uncomfortable, and I would hit the wrong button sometimes."
2.0,Super cute but fits strangely.
2.0,I bought this costume to surprise my elementary students on their last day of Kindergarten- I was disappointed when I had to keep holding the head up with one hand the entire time I had the  costume on.
2.0,These were returned. I realized I needed to be able to flip the lens up.
2.0,Only works as PJ'S or lounging.  Does not look like the photo
2.0,"Smaller than regular Skechers size, had to give away, disappointing."
2.0,"Not for women with a smaller waist and fuller hips, butt, thighs.  No support in the tummy supportive waist was to large.  High wait descends into the hip region(remember-full hips) pushing all weight to the buttocks creating bulges and a disproportionate look.  Way to long on the legs, I was walking on them.<br />Purchased a medium<br />5’6’’ 145-150lb"
2.0,"I came exactly as it looked! Good condition. But as for the chain? Ehhh. The chain broke as soon as I tried to put it on. I thought maybe it was just that one piece but no, I tugged on it very lightly and it broke as well. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice bracelet, just need to work on the strength of the chain, but you get what you paid for."
2.0,turned to dull Grey color after 2 weeks
2.0,I had expected them to fit my face better. They were a little big on my face.
2.0,"Hair sticks out of the durag, wave cap is way too big."
2.0,"One end of band about 1/4"" narrower than the other end creating a lot of slack and movement.  The larger end would not fit between the watch band posts.  Love the look and design just wish it would have worked."
2.0,"Way, way too large , but had to buy it that large to fit in the bust area, I will have to alter the sleeves, shoulders, and hemline"
2.0,Very sheer and strap broke after wore first time.
2.0,Love the print. But VERY see through.<br />Not worth the money.
2.0,Although this bracelet is an attractive bracelet and the fit was perfect.  It is already fraying.  I can't return it because it is pass the time when I can return it.  The price of the bracelet was not much but I believe that it should have lasted for longer than three months.  I would not suggest buying this bracelet if you are going to where more that once in awhile.
2.0,my toes came right out of the front of the shoe
2.0,"Pretty outfit, great price but never received the larger size after I contacted the company.  The &#34;small&#34; size is to small for a 7 pound dog.  I am stuck with an outfit that is too small and paid for. Ugh!"
2.0,"They definitely run small. I originally ordered a Large (which always works for me) but I had to return and re-ordered XL gloves.<br /><br />While the XL fit great, they ripped after only 3 uses. Poor quality..."
2.0,chains get twisted up
2.0,"Fabric nice, but found they tend to ride up a bit under the derriere."
2.0,Did not like it looks cheap
2.0,"At first it fit okay but on the first time that I washed it, it became extremely saggy and did not hold together well. The inside material hung open and constantly bothered my nose."
2.0,"I usually wear Size L, but these fit like a small...way too small...didn't fit at all above my knees!!"
2.0,"I unfortunately can't recommend this product.<br /><br />I was in the market for a good looking gym bag that was (1) affordable and (2) distinguished from the many typical Nike style gym bags. I wanted something that I could just as easily take to the gym, as use for weekend trip. Stylistically, this bag completely fit the bill.<br /><br />Functionally, however, my bag proved that you get what you pay for--after using the bag for a few months it is now unusable as the main zipper no longer works. The bag cannot zip closed easily as the zipper teeth no longer catch. If I position the bag ever so slightly I can get the bag to close, but there's no guarantee it will stay closed (it often doesn't), and the care required is really inconvenient.<br /><br />I've given an extra star here because the bag is stylistically great. It just doesn't actually work as a bag."
2.0,"The pearl is nice, but much smaller than the photo indicates. I returned it."
2.0,Very nice for price SLOW SLOW SLOW DELIVERY
2.0,The fit is super small for a Large
2.0,"Hi,<br />I ordered this and returned it same day. pretty but too thin and big for my wrist.<br />and the eye is hallow.."
2.0,"Bought size 9.5. Fit as expected BUT...<br />My husband used these no more than 5 months and this is what they look like now. He had to stop wearing them because they hurt his feet. The bottom of the sole ripped (as shown in pic)  and the soles inside also were wearing out (also pic shown). Cheap material, cheap quality. Definitely not happy. Would not recommend!"
2.0,It runs small but material seems durable
2.0,"It’s a very pretty dress, but unfortunately it looked weird on me."
2.0,The mask looks great for the rice but it's too small. Unless you are a kid or have a very small face it I'll not look great
2.0,I expected the dark blue color of laces hortizontally and vertically in the upper portion of the top. Also the overall design and color do not match. I'm kind of disappointed 😔
2.0,I thought it was gon fit but it was way to small then I expected.
2.0,gorgeous earrings but broke first time I attempted to wear
2.0,The metal to put in the ear lobe is very thin and crooked
2.0,"I was so excited to order this swimsuit and was quickly disappointed when it arrived.  The color is completely different from what is pictured.  The blue top is actually navy, and the colors in the bottom are off as well.  It was also too large for me, but I'm pretty small: 5'2&#34;, 100lbs, 32C if that helps anyone else figure out what size to order."
2.0,they are pretty but I cannot get them to stay on my top ear they fall off. I pinch them so tight then my ear hurts and they still  fall off.
2.0,"The quality seemed good but was a tight fit. My husband has a 33 "" waist and know he usually takes medium. Will not order this brand again."
2.0,I had this wallet for less than 6 months and the pouch for coins already ripped out. It loses it's shape very easily if placed in a pocket incorrectly. There are better wallets on the market.
2.0,I'm 5' 9&#34;. They reach mid knee cap. Very odd length. I'll now have to pay a seamstress to hem them. Would be nice to find a good all around bike/yoga short without having to buy online and throw away good money time after time
2.0,"Junk. I knew it with the price, but very cheap"
2.0,The pants were not the right size. Even though they said 7 the were more like size 5. Other pieces were the righ size.
2.0,Super tiny so really disappointed it didn’t fit. It is awesome and I gave it to my girlfriend who had a three year old this would fit. My 9 year old definitely did not fit in this and she is tiny. So sad 😞
2.0,"I'm 5'11&#34;, 245lbs and wear a 16/18.  This was the perfect length but was tight through the shoulders.  I wore it twice but it ripped on a seam on the second wearing.  It looked cheaper than I hoped for as well.  Won't purchase from them again."
2.0,Ehh looking like it was poor quality. The shirt itself it nice but the logo looks a little off.
2.0,the shoes was worn had  to return
2.0,The sweatshirt took an extremely long time to arrive and when it did it had a funny odor. The sweatshirt is not very soft and does not have much stretch to it. Would not buy again
2.0,"wanted this to work should have ordered a L, I normally 14.  The top and bottom we too big for my body trpe"
2.0,I did wind up returning this item as it smelled very strongly of mildew. The piece itself looks not too bad but it isn't as pretty as the picture. I couldn't say if it fit as due to the smell I did not try it on.
2.0,"The neck of the dress is sewn much different than shown in product pictures. It is sewn such that is looks like a mistake for pleats in the center instead of the lines.<br /><br />The dress was also a coarse fabric that was very wrinkled from being packaged.  The kid of fabric that if you are a bit person, and you sit down on a hot day, whil be super stinky when you stand up.  It also ran a smidge big.  Over all fairly dissatisfied, I am returning it."
2.0,"I bought this dress in 2 different sizes based on the size charts and both dresses were too large. The charts are so confusing. Amazon tells me I'd wear an XL (I'm between a L & XL in most items, depending on style) and the maker's chart told me I'd wear an XXL. Since I have mail ordered foreign made items in the past & found them too small, I followed both bits of advice. Neither fit me."
2.0,Way to small. This is supposed to be a size 2XL. it's more like a Medium.
2.0,"These are beautiful but fell apart after one wearing. The center is just string and is one long piece. If one string breaks, which it did , all of the rest unravels."
2.0,I should have purchased the bootcut style
2.0,"The fabric is very shiny, and the color is much different than photographed. It looks like a tan/light brown in the picture, but really it's a yellow/gold color. The color and the sheen make it appear cheap.  My husband said it looked like a tablecloth, and I think he was being kind. I'll wear it to work and allow the students to put their sticky fingers and boogery noses all over it, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2.0,Lacey part got a hole in it after two days of wearing it
2.0,I made the mistake of sizing up after reading the reviews; not necessary-<br />Go ahead and order your true size. Quality is good for under $20.<br />The color of the 'flowery' is not true to pic- more Ash gray. And I just noticed upon ordering a smaller.size that the price increases the smaller you go in size- (losing a star for that  dear seller)<br />Definitely hip hanging huggers😉
2.0,"I can honestly say 99% of the costume jewelry I have purchased off of Amazon I have been super happy with!  These earrings were not the case.  They came in a nice case, and opening them, I instantly thought there is no way this is what I ordered.  The pearls, are half white beads with a pearl coating, every thing about them screams cheap.  When I think of huggie hoop, I think of hoops.  These are a pierced cabochon stud with hoops attached."
2.0,The seam across the middle by your waist is very bulky and scratchy. Pretty uncomfortable. Its also a strange material. It says cotton but I feel it's not very breathable.
2.0,"It would be super cute if this was about 6"" longer, but unfortunately it is just crazy short wasted. It goes straight from the armpit to the peplum. Just a weird design that isn't comfortable or flattering on me."
2.0,"Beautiful; unfortunately one of the stones fell out after only being worn for a few times. At the price that this ring is, I would have expected that it would be of high enough quality that it wouldn’t fall apart so quickly with gentle use. I was not expecting a $300 ring quality for $30, but it’s just very disappointing, since I liked it quite a lot."
2.0,I knew it would take a while to arrive but it's so much smaller than the picture.  U can barely wrap it around your neck. It is a beautiful piece undoubtedly.  It was for a gift for secret Santa at work and the person I gave it to absolutely loved it.
2.0,Not a true black.  Very grayish.  Fair overall
2.0,To small not comfortable to wear! Hat was hard to stiff!
2.0,"Cute design, but thin fabric and it was too tight for me. Sent it back."
2.0,Not so cute when received.
2.0,The coat's zipper keeps splitting and it fits too small.  It is not worth the price.
2.0,This faux leather vest is so cute but unfortunately came damaged. Around most of the snaps there’s silver marks. Such a shame because it’s so cute but now I have to go through the hassle of returning.
2.0,These slippers are very hard to get on. They are very flimsy and my son ends up walking on the back part that goes above the heel.
2.0,"cute hat, but came damaged.  No response for return or exchange."
2.0,"Not a TRUE crossbody. Strap is too short. This purse hits me at the waist, and I am short."
2.0,"material is okay, they run VERY VERY SHORT. Returned them."
2.0,"Cute, but both broke in a couple of weeks."
2.0,"Pretty disappointed with this shirt, it does run a bit large and not as pictured color wise or how it appears to lay on the model. When you workout and move, the neck constantly rides up and you have to pull it down a lot and it's not that comfortable overall."
2.0,"Pants are a smaller size than listed, jacket/Blazer fit perfect."
2.0,"I wanted red sneakers. Despite the &#34;red rose&#34; color description, they are pink.  Wouldn't bother me normally, but I bought these for a Daniel Tiger costume and now I need to get other shoes...."
2.0,"The bags are definitely smaller than expected, not a lot of width either"
2.0,The connection attaching the shoulder strap broke and my handbag landed in the parking lot.  And the finish around the edges of the handle and the  bag is pealing away.  I've only had the set about a month.  Haven't carried the other two yet.
2.0,Looks great but mine broke in 3 months on the weld. Cheap made great look.
2.0,I ordered a large based on the sizing guide hoping it would be baggy and it definitely is not oversized. The quality is ok but the sizing is off.
2.0,The metal came out.
2.0,So I ordered a size up and I wish I order two sizes up at first I liked it it looked like the picture but once I put it on omg it was a joke the placing of this eyes are right on the boobs and I have large ones so his eyes bulge and he looks like a alien like I'm sure if I got a different design it wld fine but just ehh I don't see myself every wearing this I might take scissors and cut a huge v but then his head will be split. I don't know
2.0,"The material is almost like a cheap Halloween costume. It’s a cute dress, but would be better is it was cotton."
2.0,The fabric of the product is not nice for babies. Not soft or comfortable.
2.0,"The material is like plastic, with minimal stretching and even though I got the L/XL size after only a few uses there is already a ""run"" in the material.  What's worse is that your feet will not be able to breathe, and if you are susceptible to athlete's foot -- or even if you are not -- this will cause significant discomfort.  It's almost like wrapping your feet in plastic wrap.  As a result these socks are very uncomfortable over a short period of time.  The compression, however, is good, thus the 2 stars to be fair.  I would recommend looking elsewhere."
2.0,"Ordered based on size chart and I couldn't even get it over my head.<br />Size chart is not accurate.<br />I would rate myself a small frame person. 34c and 127lbs. From what I felt with the small, I would say maybe a L but might need to go even bigger."
2.0,Love the color but not a good fitting top
2.0,"Other commenters have mentioned that the pockets lie funny and don't look particularly flattering.  Sadly, I must agree.  I was looking forward to a skirt with pockets, but I am returning this skirt in favor of a similar skirt that falls smoothly.  I must also confirm another post describing the hem as a sharkbite cut.  This is true.  Subtle, but true.  The fabric is pretty lightweight and the fit was fine.<br /><br />For reference, I am approximately 5'8&#34;, I weigh between 170-180 lbs, and have a fairly proportionate build.  I ordered size Medium, which was probably satisfactory."
2.0,The photos of this product gave the vibe that is was a like a denim jumpsuit but it's actually made or polyester nylon and is completely stretchy (and not in a good way). It's blue like denim and that's it. It was way too small (I'm a 14/16) and bought XXXL (largest size they had). I will not put up a picture of me in it bc I look like a stuffed sausage lol. Buyer beware if you're curvy or with a bigger stomach that it will create rolls. No thanks.
2.0,Sent them right back.
2.0,"Really pretty,  but broke easily.  Did buy another one,  just because my daughter really liked it.  Won't buy it again if the second one breaks though."
2.0,"Quality wasn't what I expected - flimsy and cheap - but fit watch and resolved issue.  Better than nothing, but definitely does not compare to the original, considering the quality of the watch."
2.0,I order this product for my ceramic students thinking it would be sturdy and able to use as a mold. The masks are very flimsy and fragile.  Luckily I am innovative and was able to make it work.  But would not order again.
2.0,It’s basically transparent.
2.0,"The straps on this top are sewn too far in the center of the top, should be a little further out."
2.0,"I ordered the white with silver hardware. The strap is not paperwhite like in the product photo, but more of a cream color so it doesn't match the white purse I bought it for. The product images also show two different styles of straps. The strap you will receive is the thick one in the first photo, not the pretty, thin one in the third photo. Lastly, it's not leather (wasn't expecting it to be at this price) and feels pretty plastic-y."
2.0,"Pretty material but came about 18” off the floor. I’m 5’11” so yes, I’m tall but the model must be 4’6” to compensate for inaccurate depiction of length. Returning. Bummed because it was fairly nice!"
2.0,second belt of this type not sized properly
2.0,Material was what the picture showed but the fit was not nothing as indicated
2.0,"The front of the dress is longer in the front and short in the back. The A-line in the front is off to one side instead of in the middle, so it sits funny when wearing it.<br />The material is soft stretchy and comfortable."
2.0,The frame was is fragile
2.0,"The colors and fit are great. However, two bands have literally just broke right off of my wrist (at the pins near the frame) on the first and second days of wearing them (with no heavy/crazy use). For the price, you get 10 bands, so that's great, but two fo the four I have tried to wear have quickly broke (it's like the plastic snapped)."
2.0,This is a good buy. Runs big and is saggy on me but does the job. I normally where a L and this was more like an XL. Disappointed on size but learn from my mistake.
2.0,The top was just boxy with no shape and very short.  I didn't bother trying it on as it was for a gift and it just looked of poor quality.
2.0,Not for big boobs...I'm a size 4 and was &#34;blessed&#34; with perky DD's and this is just meant for ladies with a smaller chest.
2.0,"This hat is not very deep, just wider around. I need the depth as well... It sits on top of my head."
2.0,I needed a small but medium is the smallest size.
2.0,This is not a sweatshirt. It is a slick material t-shirt. Seems to be larger than I expected and the color is not as pictured.
2.0,Do not order this if you have any type of breasts because sis.. it's not for you.
2.0,"Cute, but fell apart easy. Have had to glue the color beads back on twice now."
2.0,"Wanted to love this toy/prop, but blades will only rise and won't lower. Given that it's a cheap consumer version for Halloween costumes, I'm not surprised, but annoyed that I paid more than its retail price to get it, only to have it not function correctly."
2.0,"This product is NOT navy, it is black with turquoise polka dots. It would still be cute except that it did not begin to fit my bust. I would not recommend this to anyone bigger than a C."
2.0,I like the way look but pretty disappointed on that the description saying it blocks blue light and it dose not block blue light which is important to me personally. Driving at night with the oncoming lights is what is most important.
2.0,"slightly small for my belly button but still fit, i loved them until they broke. The little rhinestones fell out within a few months of wearing them. All packaged very nicely. Clean and very pretty. Not a sturdy product."
2.0,Neck stretches easily
2.0,"The writing literally could not be ANY smaller. Pro and con: the silver is so shiny (pro) that I cannot even see the writing (con). There are many other birthstone rings I could have gotten. Does not look ANYTHING like the picture! If you are on the fence about buying this, keep looking!!!!"
2.0,Thrash
2.0,The silicone is not soft and does not conform to face leaving large gaps on both sides allowing air and dust to enter. Returned
2.0,"This was a Christmas present.  Mechanically it works fine.  Cosmetically it's bad.  The finish on the belt buckle chips and flakes off, revealing a light gray finish underneath."
2.0,Too small for my head. Disappointed with the quality.
2.0,I have a waist of 44 inch. and it barely fit
2.0,definitely not by American sizes...nothing fit me as an adult...ironically my 11yr old fits
2.0,I should not comment really cause you pay for what you get and while the concept is great the bag is so cheap. The ends are coming undone.<br /><br />The closure is stained badly. Would have been more upset if I paid more
2.0,Se ve la ropa interior
2.0,"Nice look, comfy feel, its a bit small on me, but stretches okay. my problem is a hole has developed in the right side by my hip. looks like the stitching came undone. what a shame."
2.0,"The item appeared to be the entire product from toe to ankle but it was only the anklet instead. I thought I was buying the entire product, very ornate but cheaply made."
2.0,"As other reviewers have mentioned, they do run way small.  I wear a 7 and ordered a 9, and they fit OK.  However, after wearing for only a week, one of the heels has broken.  I only wear them for work and change shoes when I leave, so they have not had an inordinate amount of wear in the week I have been wearing them.  It's a shame, because they actually look cute (if small) and are comfortable (since I ordered two sizes larger)."
2.0,"I love the color and very appropriate for what i got them for, I got them few months back but started using a month ago and one of the sprayer that i used more often than others already stopped working."
2.0,Made for people with tiny behinds :(
2.0,"The color and cut is nice but the elastic in the waistband gets bunched up and folds over ever easily, even when I rearrange it, it won't stay for long."
2.0,"The pants seem irregular. Other than that, they're cute and the fabric is nice."
2.0,"Hey guys study the only photo from of ring from a customer and advertising photo, the design of the ring you actually get is not as nice<br />The design you get is not as nice. There is a inconsistent pattern in the ring leaving a whole in pattern."
2.0,I like the color of the dress but it nearly tore at the seam when I put it on. I was expecting a zipper in the back but there wasn't one. Also if you will need to order a size larger. I am considering sending it back because of the fit. I don't like to wear my clothes tight and it fits really tight.
2.0,"Half of these didn't lit up, the plastic fiber optic-like attachments were either bent, or horribly glued and didn't fit in the slots."
2.0,Product description is incorrect. It says 288 earrings but I only received a pack with 144 pairs. See pic. Many vendors have better pricing for more stickers.
2.0,"The first time I wore the socks I got a nice blister within 5 miles, and had to end my hike early. I like the sock in general for the gym or whatever... but they didn't prevent any blisters..."
2.0,Was damaged
2.0,Great product but it doesn't match the samsung galaxy watch rose gold color
2.0,Warped view
2.0,"The clasp was always a bit flaky-hard to fasten and never very secure. The watch fell off my wrist a couple of times, and the clasp has now come off the band altogether."
2.0,They were much larger than I realized.
2.0,Nice gloves. Ordered some for my daughter and they were great. Ordered camo ones for my son and the velcro the hold the mittens up came sewed on the wrong side so I had to take a seam ripper to them (trying not to ruin the fabric and make it fuzzy) sew them on properly.
2.0,Very cute but cheap materials and impossible to put on without help
2.0,"The color, pattern, and cut does not appear as shown. The waist is high and the color of the pattern is much deeper. Price is acceptional to the quality."
2.0,It is sooooooo much larger then it looks in the picture.  I didn't read the dimensions...shame on me!
2.0,"I ordered this shirt in green and really like the color.  The shirt texture is comfortable and it fits as expected.<br /><br />Though the material will help keep you cool, it is thin and is a little translucent.  The pockets are more visible than I anticipated based on the marketing photos and tend to gap open unless you tuck the top back underneath the little lip."
2.0,"Looked good on the model, I can make something way better than this."
2.0,NOT MIRRORED
2.0,"While these boots fit as expected, I am doubtful about their authenticity. There's something fake about them. I have another pair of Emu boots (Stingers) from years ago and the stitching and sheepskin seem of a higher quality. These Bexley Los also don't quite keep away the cold and that for me is what I needed most from these boots."
2.0,"Ugh this bracelet is alright but after only two days of wearing it, it’s missing a stone! Feels kind of cheap but the style is really cute so I thought I’d keep it. Now I wish I just sent it back when it was delivered."
2.0,The quality of the leather section not of high quality for the comparative price of other stretch belts
2.0,"Pretty disappointed in these shorts. The green color I received is wayyyy lighter than in the photo. I was hoping for a dark green. and the material looks puffy and doesn’t feel soft.<br /><br />I am 5’6, 135 pounds and I ordered a medium. I have wide hips and thick thighs, but these mediums are pretty big on me. I could have ordered a small. I’m still going to keep the shorts and try to shrink them, but I’m not sure how much I will wear them."
2.0,Tiny! Although it was my fault for not seeing the actual size of the watch. This thing feels and looks cheap. The image is zoomed in to to make it look bigger.
2.0,Xl is not xl
2.0,"My 8year old daughter has size 3 feet (just barely) and these socks can't even make it around the heel of her foot. They look like something my 4 year old could wear, but he doesn't like unicorns so unfortunately that won't work. I'm dissatisfied with this purchase and wish I had just bought a pack of plain socks from Walmart for half price"
2.0,"Only giving it 2 stars because it was super cute. It broke literally after a week of use and it's not like I put much stuff in there just my phone, wallet, and some pencils. First the zipper stopped working and then long strap broke off on both ends. Not worth what I paid for."
2.0,Looks nice sizes are wrong got the 34C should have ordered a 36
2.0,"Came in a nice pouch,was so excited to receive it.The band is a little tight for me  but the one BIG concern is the blue dye that is being transferred to my skin..Its a nice bracelet but I would not recommend this for everyday wear.Unless you like blue wrists and a rash.."
2.0,This was tight in the Waist & hips
2.0,"This looked really weird when I put it on. It's a kind of stretchy cotton shell with the chiffon type fabric in the front. It's hard to explain, but the look and fit are just strange. I'm returning."
2.0,The elastic waist digs into my skin.  I wore it for three consecutive days hoping the elastic waist will loosen but it never did.  I would have returned it but it's too late.
2.0,Doesn’t fit small wrists. Or even wrists on the medium end.
2.0,This product looks cheap and cheesy. It doesn’t fit well. Would not recommend.
2.0,runs extremely small and material is really stiff
2.0,The fabric is a cheap polyester. I wouldn’t purchase again.
2.0,I don’t have a picture because it’s a gift for my mom but I’m not pleased with it. It’s definitely larger enough and will warm you up buuuttt it’s such a funky material and that’s what upsets me it cheap feeling. If you are someone or buying it for someone who doesn’t like weird material don’t buy it
2.0,Just got this and I was disappointed. I loved the color but the way it looks on me is weird. The collar is huge and looks like it is from the 70's. It's tight across my shoulders and is creeping up in the front. I'll be returning it. Sadly. It just hangs on me very strange.
2.0,"Pretty dress, but just didn’t like the material."
2.0,"I like the way this sweatshirt looks but the fit it strange. The crew neck is very high up and the bottom is also banded so its almost tapered at the bottom. I was hoping for a long, looser fitting sweatshirt but even sizing up wouldn't change the way it looks. Would not buy this again."
2.0,"Very flimsy fabric not well made.  Cute idea, but just doesn't hang right and not One Size Fits All"
2.0,The purse is pretty but the material is thin and I like zipper closures and this was a snap. I'm going to b4 selling this purse.
2.0,"Looks great but made poorly strap fell off in public .. Very embrassing !! Zipper didn't work from day one before I even put anything in it :( hoped it would get better only got worse :( does fit iPhone 6 but overall would not recommend waste of money I don't be using again .,,, but cute design they should of spent more money on making it though lol"
2.0,"Although other reviews said this ran small, I found that it ran really huge. I sized up according to the size chart to a 36&quot; bust and the shirt I reviewed measured 40&quot;!! Also the material is a glossy satin type and not the cotton &quot;stretchy&quot; type I gathered from the description. Sadly, this is going back. Positive note: quality seems ok and the colors are pictured correctly."
2.0,"Colorful printed design but is the texture of a plastic tablecloth.  No tag directions for drying. Plastic backing may melt in dryer, so take care.  The description is 100% polyester, but it does not have the feel of a polyester fabric because of the stiff plastic backing. The apron does not bend like cloth. Adjustable 3/4 inch wide neck tie but flimsy thin 1/4 inch wide waist ties. It would be a cute novelty gift, but it absorbs almost nothing. It is large and would not fit many small or petite cooks, but its sizing is good for most men or some larger tall women. I gave it 2 stars because the color is bright and it would be a good novelty gift, but it is not a ""serious"" apron."
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture in the top area. Looks more like a fashion project gone awry from the cage up. Not square around the breast area like in the photo. More like a rounded almost square with seams that are entirely too thick.
2.0,2 stars for the packaging everything else about these is garbage lasted 2 weeks before breaking without any stress
2.0,"The earrings themselves are fine, but the screwbacks are miniscule, and so very hard to manipulate. On top of that, one of the screwbacks didn't screw on at all. (I tried to make it work both off and on my ear. No luck.) I contacted the seller, and they did sent me one more screwback. Guess what? It didn't work either, but at that point I was done. So there you have it. I would not recommend buying these earrings. I have had much better luck with the same type of earrings from the seller Lovearing, from whom I've ordered the screwback ball earrings in both yellow and white gold. (I wear these in my second and third ear piercings, and leave them in 24/7, which is why I wanted screwbacks.)"
2.0,this was for like a toddler
2.0,Se rompió rápido
2.0,"Based on reviews and sizing, I decided to order a small but these still fit weirdly. They're loose in all the wrong places and the fabric is cheap. I'm 5'6 and 138lbs but these fit poorly."
2.0,I've purchased a lot of clothes off amazon and have not had an issue.  this dress is way too large.
2.0,"The zipper sucks and takes 5 minutes to get it zipped. First you have to match the zipper holders at the bottom and the it takes time to actually get it pull upwards. Then it gets caught in the fabric and you have to start all over again. Further if you’re big busted and order a size up, it still smashes your boobs. I would not recommend this coat."
2.0,i usually wear a large to xl in juniors shirts. i wear a 36d bra and this top buttons together all the way!! its good quality waffle knit like long johns. cute fit.
2.0,"Maybe I just got a bad one, but this was such an ill fitting dress! The length was good, but the top had tons of extra fabric under the armpits. Also, my dress had a whole in one of the pockets. Definite return!"
2.0,Definitely not correct sizes which in turn makes them a horrible buy.
2.0,Sent to family center as did not fit
2.0,"If you're looking for a simple fashion bodysuit, I would recommend, if you're getting it for dance like me, run. It is EXTREMELY see through, the chest part falls down incessantly, and the crotch snaps stick out making it look like you have a camel toe, but it's really hard metal stabbing into your lady bits. I still wear it with jeans and look cute but don't expect it to be good for anything more."
2.0,Was falling apart when we got it. It was for a school performance so not a big deal.
2.0,"I had to return my ring because it looked as though only half of it was plated silver. But as with anything you order, something can always go wrong. The rest of the ring was little and cute."
2.0,Bought it  a month ago and it is already falling apart.  Not good quality.  The return time has expired so I am out the money I spent on it.
2.0,"These tank tops are a great material and fit well at first. Haven't noticed any shrinking, but as you work out, if you sweat a lot, will begin to droop and sag much lower around the waist. Some of you may like the very long around the waist/dress/drooping look, but it's a bit long for my taste. This doesn't take away from their ability to be a tank top. They hold up and get you through the work out.<br /><br />The main issue I have with these is that they came with holes around the stitching around the tag. These holes have progressively become larger. It's just a sign of poor manufacturing. The majority of the tanks in my packs had them."
2.0,"my elephant is so cute, but he's turning pink.  bummer"
2.0,"I want to love the stroller organizer but every time I put my stroller inside and take it out of my truck, everything in the organizer flies out which basically makes it useless and I am picking everything up off the ground! The organizer does not hold shape Velcro will not hold the top close to hold your items in.<br /><br />Don’t even get me started on the drink holder it takes longer to get the drink in the drink holder and move everything out of the way if you even have any items in there because the cupholders not fixed it has a little piece of fabric that supposed to hold your cup up - you may as well pound your coffee and move on with your day before you struggle to try to get your coffee in here as you’re on a shopping trip with the baby."
2.0,good for its price ... cheap and poor quality
2.0,"I'm now wearing the 3rd band in the set. The first 2 have broken in the exact same spot, right at the loop. Both bands broke after 2 weeks of wear."
2.0,Bag is smaller than expected also usb don’t work for apple phones I will be returning item but I do love the fact it came with a matching wallet to bag
2.0,They are way to long for me
2.0,tight not the size it says .
2.0,The middle &#34;buttons&#34; were sewn too closely together so the shirt doesn't have the same upside down triangle neckhole as in the picture.  Instead my shirt's neckhole looks like a small square.  Not as cute at all.
2.0,"I am unsatisfied with the product and how to pack. The product is not manufactured with a resistant material, it did not fulfill my expectations. In addition, because the product is a poor material, it should have been better packed to avoid transportation damage with the carrier. But I have to recognize that the product is at a low price."
2.0,"This bracelet fell apart as soon as my daughter put it on.  I contacted the seller via Amazon's email contact and got no reply whatsoever.  It wasn't expensive or anything, so it's not that big of a deal, it's just the principle."
2.0,"Pretty, feminine style, but the fabric was just too rough for me! It wasn't like burlap, but it had a texture that was uncomfortable. I love off the shoulder tops, but the elastic on this was oddly tight, even though the rest of the dress fit well. Returned it, but wish I didn't have to!"
2.0,Don’t recommend if you are tall or have long torso.
2.0,"If you want to find a fabric that shows, well, everything - ding-ding, this is it!  This is not an expensive dress, obviously, and you could say “You get what you pay for”, but I ordered two other maxi dresses at the same time and about the same price level and the other two were great.  The fabric is very cheap looking, thin, and accentuating all the wrong places.  Also, the color that looks like a warm orange-peach online is a disturbing bright/light peach in actuality.  I don’t  want to sway you (haha, yes, I am trying), but buy something else."
2.0,Description says &#34;Thick&#34; but they are more on the thinner side.
2.0,COULDN'T put on in order to take a picture purchased one size larger & it still didn't fit
2.0,"I love the concept but it was WAY too large for a Pandora bracelet so I returned it. Also, the seller (Inspired Silver) is terrible to work with!"
2.0,Too small would stay on my ears
2.0,"Quality is what I expected for earrings of this price, but the kicker is the difference in the photoshopped product picture here and that of what you recieve. The backs of this earring are a fake gold CLIP that hangs down WELL past the earring itself (see photos). They look terrible from the front, as you can see these severely fake gold looking things sticking out. And then the front earring is rather heavy (to be expected with a button earring) but this 'fancy' clip is supposed to hold it close to your ear, and are NOT tight enough at their hinges, and the earring faces drop slightly downward and away from front of ear. These are the earrings you'd find at the front of an old souvenir shop in Chinatown for $2.99, or at your local DollarTree store. Although I like the blue rosettes, the rhinstones are not clear as pictured, but champagne colored. I would not recommend."
2.0,"I was disappointed, not for me"
2.0,"The material is very cheap and thin, low quality. The sleeves are very long. I wear a 2X and ordered size 5X. It fits like a 1X and I bought 4 blazers. The color is not like the picture...more pastel. If you're able to wear blazers may be ok to wear in the spring. I'm finding you're always taking a chance when ordering outside USA. I wasn't aware that I was."
2.0,This product worked 50/50.  It decreased the foggy...but it didn't go away.  Still took glasses off at work because it was annoying to have them fog up.
2.0,"I have many sets of Pajamagram jammies.  Have loved them all so this one surprised me.  The pants are the normal lovely soft material and the size was as expected.  Because I have always ordered mediums, I ripped the tags off and put them on - like I said the pants were great.  The top was so tight and uncomfortable I double checked that they hadn't put a small top in with my medium bottoms.  They are marked as medium, but there is NO WAY that they are the same medium that I received in the past."
2.0,The holes are too small for my but 😅
2.0,The product looks adorable but it ran small it didn't fit!
2.0,"Was not properly proportioned, lots of loose threads on the seams."
2.0,"It looks very cheap. I bought the same shape crop top (as per the pictures) from a different seller and it was perfect. The fabric 75% Polyester and 25% Spandex for this one is probably what makes this top look cheap and the cutouts for hands are way too open, so it can be worn without a bra (if you have perfectly shaped breasts) or everybody will see bra straps. Low-quality material and wrong design. Long story short I do not recommend it!"
2.0,Not really meant for rounder or larger faces. I bought these because I thought they were slimmer and more extended outward like a cat eye but the lenses are a lot more rounded than Id like and the frames are tight on my face and the bridge doesn't hit on my nose at the right place throwing the whole look off..l Pass on these if you're not super tiny with a much smaller face than the average female.
2.0,these slides come with a sweat liner that is poorly assembled and will fall off with very limited use....not recommended for daily use....
2.0,"Loved this dress but unfortunately it ran a whole size to small for me and they don’t carry XXL. I am 7 1/2 months pregnant and I’m wearing an XL comfortably, however this dress was way too small for me and I had to return:("
2.0,I bought a large & washed my gowns before use & it shrank. The elastic around the arms is tight.<br />Very disappointed.
2.0,I liked it a lot at first but after less than two months it’s becoming stretched out and loose.
2.0,"I ordered it about 9 months ago, but have not been able to use it.  It is too big , and can’t be adjusted."
2.0,"Very disappointed. The ad looks as if you will get both pairs, and I ordered them for a partners costume for Halloween. I opened the package and only found the red pair and need them both by tomorrow for a party. Now we do not have a blue pair...had to find some that do not match as well"
2.0,"I didn’t expect much considering the price I paid. However I was sadly disappointed when the one piece I was most looking forward to wearing came extremely tangled and broken. I didn’t bother to return it; The time and gas are spent would be more than the items. Too bad, the other pieces in the set are cute."
2.0,"Royal blue is pretty, but the material is different, and not as nice, as the other brands with the exact same style."
2.0,They are not all double lined at bust .. I've bought a few and dint understand why
2.0,Band Keeps coming undone. Doesn't hold on Fitbit Sense. Useless.
2.0,"I purchased the black color and what I received was grey.  I am returning the product.  The shoe fit somewhat small, if I had received the correct color I might have kept the product."
2.0,Was smaller than sizing indicated.  Also too long.
2.0,"Needed to return as the sizing is too small. I ordered 3T for my 2yo so we have allowance and will not outgrow it easily, when I received it, it looks like it is meant for 12mo baby. Also the terry cloth is very thin. I'm waiting for my other order for my 8yo, I ordered large."
2.0,"junk, in my opinion"
2.0,They are NOT FULL LENGTH!  picture is deceiving. Capris.
2.0,"The dress itself is very cute, and hard to beat at $8! It runs a bit smaller than expected. The dress is also shorter than I expected, but that isn't unmanageable. My biggest problem was the shipping. I ordered this at the tail end of July/early August for an event happening the middle of September. Not only did the shipping tracking give zero information past &#34;this item has left the facility,&#34; but it arrived on September 21st. A full week late for the event I was going to wear it to, and about two weeks past the arrival estimate at the time of shipping."
2.0,Muy mal producto ordené un L y párese un s no me quedó y muy mal material y no vale la pena por el precio debería de ser mejor material.
2.0,It looks nothing like the picture and I am very disappointed.
2.0,So far I’m glad I only paid $23. For this watch first the supposed genuine leather band is plastic garbage and the watch in person has a cheap look to it. I just received the watch and replaced the band so that’s all I can say for know except this watch will be the last purchased from this brand. When these companies lie about the bands being leather when in fact they are some kind of plastic makes me wonder what else about this watch they have lied about. Will update at about the one month mark.
2.0,"While it is pretty, t he leather is very thick, but the prongs are very delicate, no support at all.  Makes it very hard to actually buckle the belt."
2.0,Fit isn’t always good it can be a little uncomfortable and I guarantee they’ll fog up while you’re playing
2.0,"Cute, but it's so poorly made. This was bought for my daughters pageant as a modeling dress and whether or not it was for a pageant or everyday wear, I HAVE to do some &#34;repairs&#34;. The ends of the ribbons are frayed, the large bow in the center isn't cut evenly at all! A little upset."
2.0,Way too hard to pull the locking grommets from the straps out.
2.0,Super wide but the length of the sleeves is shorter then shown on model. Returned.
2.0,Product supposed to be one size fits all. the elastic waist band much too small. May fit smaller leaner individuals ...Mx waist size 30-32
2.0,They ended up being dif size then expected had to return twice and reorder somewhere else!
2.0,"The hat appears to be a good product. Only thing I don't like is the ZZ Top logo.<br />It's a decal, not a sewn on patch.<br />Also, don't order if you need it quick, mine shipped from China and took about 2+ weeks to arrive."
2.0,To don't sit flat on ear with martini setting.
2.0,This seems like a good slipper for the price but you need to order at least 2 to 3 sizes above your normal shoe size.  I ordered 15/16.  Too small for me buy fit my son fairly well.  His normal size is 12.
2.0,I thought the fabric would be more stubstantial.  It's thin and I didn't like the way the dress hung on me.  It looked cheap.
2.0,Wiring for lighting didn’t work. First one didn’t work & had a buzzing noise. Got a replacement & didn’t work.
2.0,"This is cute, however the colour changes super fast! I haven't work this 3 times and I don't think I can wear it again. Not worth the price."
2.0,The size ran small.  Shirt was good quality for the price.
2.0,Some beads are really hard to put together and once piece is completed beads come apart untimely
2.0,Not very shiny and too hard to work with.
2.0,It's a slip not a cover.  It's ok.
2.0,Very thin material provides no support
2.0,"Fur quality is uber crappy, even for a 13.00 hat. It is a little bit smaller than every other trapper hat I have bought....ever! Lol. Other than that, it looks cool, matches a bunch of stuff in wardrobe.  Gets compliments.  But fur tickling my inner ear is whack."
2.0,So I really love these! They are pretty and the right one fit great and was comfy but the left earing clip wont clip. It just keeps popping open. My left ear is no different than my right... very disappointed.<br /><br />Update! My wonderful husband was able to take pliers and for the clamp down more and now it works! So happy! So if yours won’t clamp get some pliers!
2.0,Cute look but way too small in the chest.<br />Originally ordered a large but no room for my chest. Reordered in an extra large but the fit was even smaller. Also would have fit a super skinny 6 foot woman
2.0,To big and falls apart when you try to put it on
2.0,Started to unravel before I even washed it. But great color.
2.0,"unless you're going to wear this as a swimsuit coverup, i would not purchase. Very transparent. I even wore nude panties and you can still see the color! I also purchased a different size and pants were very different in color, style and fabric."
2.0,Half the socks didn't fit him and broke when he tried taking them off.
2.0,Not very durable. Wore a pair once and both big toes went through
2.0,"Perfect size, weight! Contacted customer support via email to purchase additional keyrings. Reply was that none available from Troika Germany at this time, but using another brand would be fine. Purchased very similar keyrings (size, etc.) and while adding two rings, the ball that holds them popped out (see photo showing spring? That's where ball was before it popped out). We were stunned by how easily it broke.<br />  Dislike giving low reviews, but considering the cost, customers should be warned."
2.0,The design of the shirt is loose.  So it should be loose everywhere.  Nope. Its tight in the sleeves and therefore doesn't lay the way its supposed to.  It looks like there should be a lot of slack but there isn't.
2.0,Absolutely not true to size as the small I ordered was very large - the top is wider than normal and the trousers are baggy on the leg. The fabric design is nice but it creases easily and the selvage on the front hem of the top is insufficient where there is a strange piece of extra fabric
2.0,Very thing not exactly as I thought it would be but good enough i guess you get what you pay for!
2.0,Not good purchase broke within the first two hours the clasp broke and fell to the floor the back broke off and scratch the glass now it does not keep time I called the company and they are replacing it with a new one have not received the new one yet
2.0,Thin fabric. All lumps and bumps are visible
2.0,I thought it was women's size but it's one size fits all. Way too big for a woman's head.o.k. For men but too much style for a man well built
2.0,This product looks very nice but about a month into wearing it the magnetic adapter that clicks into the watch just snapped off while I was wearing it and the screws are so small I was never able to find them and now my watch band is useless.
2.0,"Can't wear this anywhere. Rides too far up the front when walking. Waste of money. Ordered medium. First well, but can't wear it out"
2.0,"Im 5’9” and wear medium size clothes. I purchased a US medium size. Waist up this fits ok, but the hood is way too small. Waist down is very confusing. They are super tight and super long, like a good 6” longer than my legs and fit like tights. The designers either do not understand human body proportions, or these are made for the aliens in South Park."
2.0,"I've had these now for several months. They are poorly made and very flimsey. The first one broke in my hand after a few weeks, when I went to flip it up. The second one lasted a few months longer, but recently did the same thing, falling apart in my hand. The concept is good, and when they work, they're convenient. But don't expect them to last very long as flip-up glasses. I have now superglued them back together and wear them as regular sunglasses. I would not waste my money on buying them again."
2.0,This was super cheap quality. The leg warmers look like cracked leather if stretched a little. I expected it to be a little better quality for the price. It was larger than expected and the bow was way too small. It worked for about 30 min but if you need something for longer than a few pics get another costume.
2.0,"Pissed that these socks got a hole in them within the first month. Like I literally have socks that I've had for years, but yet these don't last a month.<br />I loved them before I had to toss them since one had a hole in it. Smh."
2.0,"If you have narrow feet these shoes are not for you, unfortunately my feet slide right through the front. Beautiful shoes otherwise."
2.0,"The two stars is for the bottoms alone. I sized up and the bottoms fit perfectly. However, the 'sports bra' was too big. It has multiple straps on the back for design purposes, and when you adjust the two shoulder straps, the rest of the straps are just loose and it looks bad. The tank-top was too formfitting and small. I ended up returning it and receiving a refund."
2.0,"I was upset when I got this because it was very thin material you could see right through it , it shouldn't be priced at what it is there is not very much material even though it is stretchy and so it slips off your head if you don't use any bobby pins which you don't want to use cuz that's why you buy a head wrap it's part of a style but the picture is misleading because you can see your hair through the material would I buy this again no especially not at that price."
2.0,"I have a normal width foot and these were super tight and uncomfortable. Adorable and cute, they had to be returned."
2.0,All I can say is frumpy potato sack.  Nothing like that photo.  Thin and shapeless
2.0,"Very thin fabric.  Lace came off one pair after one wash.  Great idea for under dresses, but not highest quality."
2.0,"Cheaply made, had to remove the elbow patches made of cheap flimsy material and they were sewn in the wrong spot for the elbow!  I wear it around the house when it's chilly but wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Bought this case and I loved the way it looked but when I tried using the front camera it showed the case
2.0,Stitched were very weak and had to reinforce them by hand more than once.
2.0,"This hat fits my head, but it fits very odd. It's almost too small and too big at the same time.."
2.0,I did not realize the words silver and turquoise were just colors.  The turquoise is plastic.  The silver is metal.
2.0,"The print is awkwardly large which I should have known from the picture, and the arm holes are super small so it's not really a flattering cut. Material is super soft and cute slogan so...choice is up to you! :)"
2.0,When I first got it it was so pretty the color was gorgeous and the gems  we're so nice but then after three days it started resting I didn't think it was the type to tarnish so this is the type of belly piercing jewelry that you can only wear for certain occasions you cannot shower  with it or get and water at all it turned black within a matter of three days
2.0,"I bought this for my trip to New York and it was PERFECT!  All the pockets, the ease of carrying it around my torso made it one of the best items I took on my vacation.  I still carry it now that I'm home. However, 2 1/2 months later the strap breaks from the body of the purse. I'm not happy!!"
2.0,This case comes as 2 parts.
2.0,"The side of the top does not have ruffles has an almost bra-like cut out. It's unflattering. in order to ""line that part up,"" you have to keep pulling down the top. Pass on this one."
2.0,"Zipper broke first time wearing it! The coat needs to have more buttons.<br />I purchased an XL (I wear a med/large) and the length of the sleeves are just enough, but when I move around, it’s too short.<br />The pockets are too much at an angle and stuff falls out easily unless buttoned.<br />Good news: The coat has a nice cozy lining and the hood is roomy and comfortable as well. Most of the coat keeps out the cold,… just wish the front would close."
2.0,They fit two sizes smaller as needed. Metallic is good.
2.0,I ordered small and it was much too large.
2.0,"I wear a corset as a work uniform at a club on the weekend and I did not like the way this fit. It did not give me the waist I am used to having in a corset and it also bunched funny in the middle. It worked for the purposes I needed it to but I do not feel sexy in it. I also dont love the eye and hook clasps all the way up the front, it takes a long time to put on. Should have had a zipper."
2.0,"Cute suit, but not very supportive in the chest area.  Also, this suit doesn't have much tummy control."
2.0,"In fact, after recieving these pants I wish I had checked wish first because I probably would have gotten the same thing only cheaper.. anyway these are very falsely advertised and are NOT cotton. The tag says 95% rayon and 5% spandex. The material is very thin and these pants are definitely low quality. I do however feel like they mostly fit the same way down both both legs and around the body and such and what I do like is the elastic in the ankles - it is loose fitting but hugs enough that the pants don't go too long. That was mostly what I was wanting out of them - comfortable loose lounge pants that wouldn't go past my ankles on my tiny legs. I am only 5 feet tall. As for the fit around the waist if I pull them all the way up they will cover my 24 week pregnant belly easily and comfortably hug around my rib cage below my boobs. But I feel like I can probably also wear them low on my hips comfortably if I want to go MC Hammer style. Can't trust too much on fit though because you obviously can't trust the seller already with material and I ordered small and was sent pants with an M sticker.. so who knows what size they are.  There is no size identifier on the tag. I do wish they were cotton."
2.0,Cute but the arms were way too short for me
2.0,Nice dress but definitely Not a tie at waist.  Tie is more like an empire waist.<br />Buttons are closed with a small loop of elastic.<br />Top is very tight
2.0,these are very cheaply made........all of the longer ones have broke off. I would not buy this product again.
2.0,"Can't imagine why these are rated so highly.  One pair appears to have mismatched lenses (certainly not +1.50 anyway), glasses misshapen, eye piece / nose holders uneven, lense fell out on one pair and general quality seems sub par.  Granted, they are extremely inexpensive, but when it comes to my eyes I need a little more.  Never would have ordered without the high rating, but in my case it seems rating vs price way too good to be true.  I will be returning."
2.0,I read one review that said the band was too large but I am a 36B and it was a poor fit at best.  Possibly if you are a 32-34A then the 36B would fit but nothing larger by any means.  It is very nice otherwise and if it fit I could see myself buying several.
2.0,I can't really understand how to put everything straps on? .-. They were undone en it came in. I can't figure it out. The skirt is so way way way tighter than I expected. But it's hard to make the top flattering.
2.0,I thought these were very cute but after I got them they were a little small around the opening and  I didn't think they would be very warm. I ended up sending them back:(  Looking for something that will be warm.
2.0,Metal pieces on ends break off
2.0,"For other buyers - I am 5'3, 115lbs. I think I read another review where someone wrote &#34;just hangs there&#34; and I would describe that as accurate. I ordered medium which is too large but it's just like a sack. I can see maybe wearing this as a top with leggings or jeans but as a dress - the panty line is so severe I don't think I'd personally wear it as a dress. I don't believe I'm even going to bother ordering this in another size."
2.0,"Comfortable tunic, long and perfect for leggings. Thin material, ideal for the summer months. It came with some stains on it that I haven't been able to get out in the wash, along with two small spots on the top of the shirt where the top layer is torn and you can see white underneath. I bought it for everyday wear, but I guess I'll have to use this for a gym shirt instead. Disappointing, because other than that it would have been a new favorite."
2.0,These headbands are very thin.  They are not thick enough to do much good when the sweat is running down your face.
2.0,This outfit does not look like the picture they promote it to look like. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,Fits about 2 sizes smaller
2.0,The concept is good but you need to know how to pick the right strengths
2.0,"It serves it's purpose, but flimsy and cheap feeling.  Not worth the money."
2.0,Sandals were way too small. I ordered 7c toddler and they were like a size 5c.
2.0,Looks nice but cheaply made. Tried to make it smaller and all the pins are cracking in half which makes it hard to put them back in.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this shawl, but the color pink (mauve) looks faded and dirty.  the material is scratchy and the gray with the pink i thought would be beautiful together, but because the pink is so off-color, the entire shawl looks dingy.  Very disappointed.  The material definitely does not have a ""cashmere"" feel.  Pass this one up."
2.0,"The post metal is so soft that it bent the first time I put them on.  the clasp is very hard to push on.  It states nickle free, but my ear still turned red and irritated.  I wear them on a black sweater now instead of in my ears so I can make sure that the post doesn't snap off the back."
2.0,"Short through the rise, but otherwise fit as expected.  The material is not as nice as I expected; scratchy rather than soft."
2.0,"Although they appear to be packaged as original Harry Potter merchandise, they are very small and you can barely discern the design.  Would be OK for a younger girl not adult."
2.0,"This just isn't my style. I love the Pattyboutik sweaters, but this one is too long for me."
2.0,Shorts do not match what is advertise on the photo bummer
2.0,This was not. Flattering on me at all - retuned
2.0,"I really like the style....you get what you pay for, the boots were cheap for Frye boots, the leather is cheap.  I am keeping the boot however due to the cute factor, not quality."
2.0,The hat is more for men then ladies.
2.0,"I bought glass bracelets from our local flea market and I fell in Love with them, I dropped and broke two of them and search for them here and found them then ordered them, sadly they were too small so I had to return them. I hope Amazon gets them bigger than 2:6, for adults these fit kids."
2.0,"I only paid 8 dollars so I didnt expect these to last long and I was right. I wore them to our local river outing and the area where my fat toe is located ripped the  fabric.  I was upset but figured, I got what I paid for."
2.0,I’ll start by saying the colors and print were cute! That’s only good part. The fabric is very thin like a bed sheet. I ordered a medium however the chest area was huge. It’s supposed to be a wrap style dress however it was very loose on top. I returned it!
2.0,"These are highly elastic and in all the wrong ways. Falls apart quickly. Not super flattering either. Love the colors, though."
2.0,"Runs SMALL •  Not nearly as ""young"" looking leans more towards a patterned material your grandma would wear☹️."
2.0,the bracelet is alright but even on the tightest setting it's still to big for my wrist and slips right off.
2.0,I liked the colors... but too many clothing items from Amazon run small... giving it away.
2.0,Ripped off my keychain after 3 months.
2.0,"Surprised by this one. I've ordered four dresses from ACEVOG, and three of them were spot on for sizing. I went up a size on this one after reading the reviews, and the shoulders were still too tight. I felt like I would pop the little button closer open. It was very pretty, but had to send it back."
2.0,Bust recommendation up to 39.4 for a medium.. I am 39 and where the bust hits was too tight. Will need to return.
2.0,Ok bracelet if you have large wrist....too big for me
2.0,"So even after reading some negative reviews, I got this bottle anyway, and it was a mistake.  It's the perfect size for most of my runs, but that's about it for the positive.  The bite valve is the type that makes you work a little to get your water. I knew this going in, so that was my fault.  The real issue is with the seal between the cap and the bottle.  First off, if you lose the silicone gasket between the bottle and cap (which falls out easily) you will render this bottle useless because it will leak like a sieve.  In a best case secenario, it takes a lot of finegelling to get the cap screwed on correctly without pinching the fabric between the cap and bottle.  This will also make it leak.  This is not too bad when it's hot out, but when my hands are already cold, I don't want them cold and wet.<br />It's a nice looking bottle that holds the right amount for me. It's just riddled with design flaws and definitely shouldn't be used in a race situation where you need to refill quickly and go.  I should've listened to the reviews."
2.0,Ends of the metal wires hurt my ears when I ware them in sports.
2.0,Strap to tie too high up
2.0,I like them but 1 pair was broken
2.0,Could not use&#34;mommy girl&#34; was on the back side of the necklace. No way to get on the front!
2.0,"Although this watch clearly stated it was 40mm, it seemed much larger on my wrist.  Have wanted a Skagen for many years and couldn't pass on this one for the great price I purchased it for.  However, the one I got had a dent on the band and I was disappointed in the way it looked and wore on my wrist. Just wasn't what I thought it would be.  Courteous return was greatly appreciated."
2.0,Got a D fits big and not very sticky fots bubbly
2.0,"I actually like these pants, but hope with this 2 star review the manufacturer will read this and revise the label.  The washing instructions are ""Do Not Iron - Do Not Bleach - Do Not Wash (?)- Do Not Tumble Dry "" Then there is a""P"" in a circle with ""Day Wash"".  I hand washed them, to check they dye, and put them in the dryer... no problem."
2.0,"I ordered one size up - as recommended by reviews but these shirts are too big. I am 5'4&#34;, 115lbs and usually wear a small. I should have ordered a small. I'm returning this item. I don't like them enough to re-order a small."
2.0,Odd bust cups mess this up. I'm disappointed.
2.0,"I only had these glasses for a few weeks and they pretty much were kept in the car without much wear and tear, but the frame cracked around the lens. I tried to continue to wear them, but the lens would pop out each time. Not worth the time and energy to try to super glue and still be left with a visible crack."
2.0,Extremely small. If your a medium buy XL if your a large or bigger don't bother!
2.0,Purchased this hat for a 5 y/o. Hat size appropriate for a new born.
2.0,"Stretch was lacking, xx was not xx, very tight."
2.0,Beautiful color but several of the diamond chips fell out. I was so disappointed
2.0,A bit disappointed that these weren't longer.
2.0,Heel box to loose. Toe box to small.
2.0,"My 4 year old son got these for Christmas and he loves them, however the left shoe seems to die after only and hour or so of wearing them which makes him super sad when one shoe is working and the other is not.  We also did not get a charger with this pair so we have to use the charger his sister got with her pair every time.<br />I plan on returning these shoes and ordering a replacement."
2.0,"Stripes don't match at seams, quality disappointing!"
2.0,When ordering I purchased the 4 piece set. However I only received 3 strings of beads👎🏽The beads are nice but I’m disappointed that I didn’t get what I ordered. This is the first time in Amazon history 😔
2.0,"It’s a awesome watch, but the light is so dim I can’t even see it at night. I get that is a $10-15 watch, but the light is something that bugs me. If you’re just looking for something VERY SIMPLE than this is for you."
2.0,I nab this thing for a trip to Disney and worked well to begin with. The issue happened on about the third day with the thin pocket near the back strap. I put in a smaller notebook that put a little pressure on the zipper and it cause it to rip. Other than that the rest of the bag worked fine. Just a little disappointed that it only took three days to rip at the seam that connects the zipper with the rest of the bag.
2.0,Wasn't what we wanted
2.0,"I got this septum clicker for my daith piercing. It's cute. Wish I could wear it. I actually ordered 2 as the first one was so small I didn't see it in my Amazon order and threw the mailer package away. I had to adjust the closure as it was tight as hell. It was very hard to get it into my piercing being on the side of my head my fault, not the rings fault. I had it in for a couple weeks and I loved how it looked but it was bothering my ear, which makes me think it's not made from quality materials. You can see the swollen redness of my piercing in the photo. I switched back to my old ring and the swelling disappeared."
2.0,"I wish this would have worked for me. I'm 5'5 & 100 pounds & 32B chest and ordered a small. The top part of the dress had so much extra fabric that they waist can down to an awkward spot. I like my maxi's to touch the ground, and it was barely touching. It looked terrible one. me."
2.0,Stitching was loose and quality wasn’t up to par
2.0,normally I find PajamaGrams sizing to be generous -  not so with these / not even close
2.0,The seam was on the outside which makes it look super cheap. :(
2.0,Made my fingers turn color
2.0,Beautiful but didn't fit me at all.  I'm 36/37B and 30&#34; waist.
2.0,"I purchased the cross for my husband and he really liked it.  However, the top of the cross broke the second day and it was not repairable. I didn't return it because I got it for free due to another issue.  The look of the cross was great, but I was very disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Too small. Not a typical USA XL. I followed the sizing chart and went with the XL. These are very small and also short in length. Had to return. Also zippers seem like they won’t last too long.
2.0,"It's cute, but entirely too small. I have relatively thin legs and a medium was difficult to pull up over. And if you are busty, forget it. Im not even sure a large would have fit, and I am usually a small or medium."
2.0,I love the cut of these tanks but one arrived being damaged. Strap wasn't attached
2.0,This necklace is pretty but i do not recommend buying it. It fell off my neck twice the day I wore it. My step daughter wore it n she ended up losing it the next day.
2.0,Too long. Looks I'm trying to tuck more than just my fat
2.0,Product was soft. Had to return due to being to large
2.0,"Pretty but, I threw it away after 1 wearing. This was due to the fact it kept popping open."
2.0,"I liked the Heart shaped pendant Locket alot but after wearing it awhile the back fell off & now I'm worried it will fall off all the time! So I probably won't be wearing it much! So I can't rate it highly.<br /><br />  Sincerely,<br />  Audrey C. Johnson"
2.0,"The color and style are pretty cute. However, unfortunately, the fabric is thin and low quality and is very wrinkly :( The mom dress is about half a size smaller than normal fitting so you probably want to size up when ordering."
2.0,Nice dress but lasted only a few months. Color fades very quickly - not good quality.
2.0,The face was smashed so had to reform with heat gun. Fur around eyes was lifting so had to re-glue. Teeth were glued in very crooked so had to pull out and re-glue.  Added a foam liner to make more comfortable.
2.0,Not a true women's size
2.0,These gloves simply don't seem to be made for my hands. I use them to ride my motorcycle with and the knuckle holes don't line up with my knuckles. I think the only real solution is to find a store that sells gloves that I can try on before I buy. They were worth the price.
2.0,Did not keep mynhands warm in 20 degree weather
2.0,Does the job BUT the zipper keeps getting caught.
2.0,Fascinator is VERY cheap looking....Not worth the modest price!
2.0,"I have to agree with the couple of reviews stating that this item is too small.<br /><br />The &#34;Blue/Pink 01&#34; skirt is tea/midi length, and it is not floor-length as depicted on the model photo.<br /><br />I am petite...short :) ...5'2&#34;.  Wearing it with the waistband around my natural waist (26&#34;), the hem of the skirt just barely hits below my knee!  I purchased this item in a size medium, and it was just really unflattering.  The waistband is elasticized with button closure going down the top middle front of the skirt -- as on the photos.  There are two buttons on the elastic part of the waistband (one on top of the elastic, and another on the bottom of the elastic).  You can probably imagine how that would look unless the elastic aren't stretched at all; the material between the first two buttons bulges and leaves a gap.  Not cute! lol!!<br /><br />As far as the material of the skirt, it is thin, but it isn't completely see-through (maybe due to the print).  However, in a sunny setting, a silhouette of the legs can definitely be seen.<br /><br />******My tip:<br />Pay close attention to the (sort of) accurate size chart, and order according to the waistband as if it isn't stretchy."
2.0,"Yes, they are real. Includes The CLAWS. Poorly made, the foot pulls out easily from the metal clasp. Don't bother if you really want to use as a Keychain."
2.0,"I don't like to leave a poor review, but I have to share my experience. I was excited to find an affordable variety of bands. I recieved these items yesterday. I tested them on my Fitbit Versa and only a couple of them actually worked out. Whenever I was trying the black one on my watch, one of the pins broke (as pictured). Some of the pins were too long and they wouldn't even fit, and some of the pins were too short and the band would slide off. A couple of the bands had misaligned holes and wouldn't even fit on the watch anyways. I added a star because the actual watch material looks to be in good condition and the colors are as shown, but that's the only positive I saw."
2.0,These ears are so much smaller than the pic makes them seem. And they parts fell of easy that kept them on the headband.<br />They are the exact color shown. And the headband is quite comfortable.
2.0,"The arm holes are big. You would need to wear a second tank top under it. I bou several of these. I ended up keeping them, but I needed to alter each me."
2.0,"The shoulders of this dress aren’t stretchy at all so it either is super tight if you have broad shoulders or falling down if you don’t and the material is prone to static cling. Had to return. Otherwise, a very pretty dress."
2.0,"comfy. well made. soft around leg/ankle. UPDATE...OOOps! Spoke too soon...here we go...too tight above ankle, left ring indents @ band site. Might work well for a leg with no meat or cushion. Aaaand...too much tangly strings inside, snags up w/toenails. Then there's da too tight/short foot bed...gladly they are stretchy...gotta keep tugging/pulling da sock away from my toes...deadgum boa constrictor! I cut off da ankle band to just above ankle, works mo betta and no rings or, surprisingly, no fraying or falling apart! Whaaa?! NO buy again."
2.0,I received this product with a hole in the stitching of the thigh
2.0,"Nice print, but too thin, can see through, have to return it!"
2.0,Picture faded and peeled before first wash. Cheaply made.
2.0,Poorly made.. buttons fell off after the first and second wash. Hang dry to avoid wrinkled seams
2.0,"I really wanted to like these.  The sad truth is that they just don't work for me.  I asked my wife to try them and she could not use them either.  I thought when I saw this, that these would be great!  Maybe they will be for you.  I am sad that they don't work for me."
2.0,Good material and cute. Def not for a preemie or newborn. More like 3-6 months.
2.0,It is okay I realized I need a large instead of extra large... I thought I wear xl top my understanding bra should be also...well that was wrong... I will purchase a large an give you a better update... My aplogee I wasn't that much help
2.0,"Fit is too small and tight. It is also very short. I ordered a large. I’m 5’6 150 pounds, usually go medium in tops and large in bottoms.  Ordered this in a large and it’s basically useless. Also very see through."
2.0,"wear the bracelets every day , the thread became lose and couldn't fix it,it's a waste of money"
2.0,I really wanted to like these but they are not cotton and more polyester with 0% stretch except the waist band.  They wrinkle terribly and bunch up when sitting down. I was looking for a comfortable short and these are not that.
2.0,Medium is my size but they are too hard to put on my feet
2.0,Disappointed with quality of product/ Not to size.
2.0,The black band gets uncle real fast
2.0,The top covers the state name on the tag and the bottom covers the expiration date on the tag.  The camouflage washes out the unit name.  Not a good purchase.
2.0,Fabric not great
2.0,STill hanging in my closet with the tag. Missed return deadline. Is NOT relaxed. Might as well be a bodycon dress
2.0,Not white as ordered. Short and tool was strange. Hard to have high hopes for something so inexpensive. Returned.
2.0,"Mixed review on this - the fit is good (I usually wear a Med or Lg & got this in size Medium @ 5’8”, 140 lbs, 36B), but the knot thing is a wadded mess!<br /><br />PROS:<br />- armholes are cut so they cover well<br />- soft fabric<br />- back length is decent to partially cover your rear<br /><br />CONS:<br />- the knot came in a wadded up mess with a bunch of hanging strings<br />- fabric is thin & clingy - the kind that sticks to you like there’s static<br />- the knot is right in the middle of my body, so looks like an odd lump from the side<br />- the knot positioning exposes the V of my crotch is all that it does<br /><br />Not a fan! A fine idea but, unfortunately,  with a thin fabric that makes the knot a lumpy mess.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope it’s Helpful!)"
2.0,I usually wear 7 1/2 so I  Ordered size 8. They were really big
2.0,They are cute but the silver ones tore. 😕
2.0,"These are handy and help organize my suitcase. The extra pouches were great, too. However, the zippers seemed flimsy and I didn't trust them to last beyond a trip or two. I ended up buying another brand for comparison, and the choice was simple. For the same low price, other brands offer much higher-quality zippers and fabric, which is important if you're trying to stuff these full like I was!"
2.0,"I bought this as a gift for a former coworker and she loved it. It's a bit expensive, but it's a great ring that she'll keep by her side. Sadly, I only got the ring. There was no chain to wear as a necklace and no lomo cards as mentioned. I was pretty bummed out about it and didn't really have time to return and order another one."
2.0,"I loved how this skirt fit and looked, but ultimately it was so thin you could see through it and I had to return"
2.0,the dress was too small
2.0,My toddler will not wear these bc she tripped once in them due to her little feet sliding in and out as she walked.  Cute but not efficient.
2.0,"These are not buttery soft and although they mostly fit, the leg hems/stitching is super tight, making them poorly designed, uncomfortable and unattractive. I am a big girl but my weight is evenly distributed all over (I have average-sized thighs). I literally had to tear the stitching out to make them functional as I needed them under a dress for an event. I will not re-purchase these with much better options available."
2.0,"Well, I kinda figured they would be cheaply made, but I was still disappointed.  The frames are very wide and fit too loose, and the lenses are a cheap plastic that actually scratch my face.  I just didn't like them at all."
2.0,"I am disappointed in the quality of the fabric...especially the sleeve pattern which looks very cheap. If I had seen it in a store, I would not have purchased it."
2.0,Bought as a gift and was sent a shirt that was too small.
2.0,Not what I anticipated. I was looking for a more traditional style jacket and this was paper thin with no shape. Returned.
2.0,"These shorts do make your bottom look good, but I found the seams to be way to annoying to actually keep them. The size of the shorts was fine, but I could feel the seems against my skin even while I was standing still."
2.0,"3 of the 6 fit great and had a great elastic band that does not slip, especially with having a ton of hair. The 3 solid colored ones barely stay on. There is really no band to hold it in place."
2.0,"They fit great but was a little disappointed because I only received 5 rings instead of 6 and 3 we're black, 1 was silver and 1 was colored which was pretty much all green."
2.0,It was way too small not accurate to size chart.
2.0,"Love the look of the pocket watch.  Anyone who knows dr who can have an appreciation of the design.  However, it hit a table when it was in my pocket.  No damage tot he outside of the watch but the arms that are used to tell time fell off.  It didn’t even hit that hard.  I was sitting down and bumped the table."
2.0,The colors are very transparent and don’t look like the pictures. There was also a word dust all over them.
2.0,"The quality is nice, and they are soft but these are just leggings, NOT jeggings. They don't look a thing like you'd expect, they fit like pantyhose and look like it as well. Unless you plan on wearing these with a dress or skirts don't buy them."
2.0,"I had such high hopes for this product, but it was so small and fit like a shirt instead of a dress. I even made sure to size up due to online purchases and all. The texture is sort of like a blend of linen and burlap. If you can find it to fit you I'm sure it will look cute."
2.0,"Ok so here is the deal, I'm 5'9/10 and this suit is totally long enough to cover everything! Which is awesome! However I expected it to be way more forgiving in the mid section. I carry all my weight in my stomach and arms (I've got legs for days, if only the rest of my body would follow) I wear a 16 and 2 x and I got the size 20, it has enough support for me in the boobs department... BUT I'm not blessed (b or c... :( lol)  so it's nice that it fits better there but it sure did hug my stomach like no other! Not attractive,  but I needed something to wear so I told myself that I just needed to go to the gym and it would be fine... then I got in the hot tub and the layers are not made wel AT ALL and I got mega boob the entire time. It was a good laugh but really? Like it even did it when the jets were off. I'll be sending it back (if I can) i personally would have given it more stars (I'll admit I'm just fat) but the quality of it deserves 3 stars.<br /><br />It's ok if it were 10-15 not 35."
2.0,"Arrived in a small plastic bag. Beautiful, but didn't last the night. The stones chipped and fell out. Looked like it was crushed, when I just wore it out to dinner and the casino for a date night with my husband."
2.0,"Tried wearing it and got a headache within a few minutes because it was way too tight. My five-year old son liked it so I gave it to him but he even took it off saying it was too tight. No idea who they made the headband for, it is not wearable."
2.0,they turned red within two weeks...poor quality!
2.0,"It looks beautiful, but I've had it since October 21st to now, December 4, 2019, and I question whether this is really stainless steel, because the Rose gold plating has started to come off and it looks like low-quality rusty metal. It makes my skin itch and little tiny pimples pop up. So, unless you only want this watch strap for 51 days I would not recommend it."
2.0,Shirt isn’t a fitted shirt. The collar on it is huge. I didn’t return it but wouldn’t purchase again.
2.0,"Honestly Love the way these look and fit, but the broke after only a couple wears, and I didn't drop them or sit on them. They literally just snapped in my hand when I opened them to put them on."
2.0,Nice hat but should be priced at $25 compared to other alpaca hats
2.0,Couldn't ever get it to fit--either too tight or too lose. Finally it fell off the 2nd day and I cannot find it.
2.0,"Cute top, but it doesn't fit right. It's a little bit too short, & it flares out at the waist. I like the criss cross, but that's about it."
2.0,"I absolutely loved my ring, so beautiful... until my jewel fell out in less than a week 😔"
2.0,The navy blue color that it shows in the picture doesn't match with what I got in the package. The color is light blue.I don't like it. But I will keep it because to return it will be too much to go thru. So sad.
2.0,Fabric feels cheap
2.0,narrow also but they are warm with good traction
2.0,"good quality sweater, but be sure to order a size larger since this sweater runs quite small!"
2.0,Bigger than you think it is.
2.0,"Too small, I ordered a M and it fits like XS"
2.0,So far they are staying stuck to my sun glasses. Update: one fell of after a week.
2.0,"This is not the same outfit that is on the picture ,the picture has large floral prints and pleaded legs the actual outfit I received the  print has smaller floral print in non-pleated legs. I will still keep the outfit for vacation but it is not the picture."
2.0,The earring itself was cute and was as pictured with one exception.  The post of the earring was bent sideways when I opened the package.  The minimum force used to correct it caused the post to snap off. Glad I did not pay much for this since I never got to wear it.
2.0,"nice blue color, NOT COTTON, runs a bit large"
2.0,It fits but only with the extender that it comes with.. and it's not comfortable at all. It's stiff and scratchy. ALSO they lowered the price by like 4$ right after I bought it. :/
2.0,Not what was listed got 2 gray 2 navy blue and 2 tan.  Description says 1 gray 1 blue 1 white and 3 assorted ??? Well I guess you meant 1 blue 1 gray and 4 assorted. Very misleading not happy at all!!
2.0,"At first the tie was nice and looked great, but after a few wearings it has begun to fray on the edges and looks bad. I fear it has only a wear or two left before it's no longer wearable in nice dress."
2.0,"Great looking and comfortable socks. Wore out at toes in less than six months, wore about 3 times a month."
2.0,Falls apart very easy
2.0,"This mask was pretty, and seemed reasonably well made, but it was too flat for my face, and the eyeholes were too small for me. It might work for a child or someone with smaller eyes (my eyes are not particularly big). I sent it back."
2.0,"Not stretchy, so I can't get it over my hand due to swelling of my thumbs from arthritis.  Beautifully made, but worthless without the &#34;stretch&#34; factor."
2.0,Fit too tight for my taste
2.0,Ordered a large and it looks like a small or medium. Way off on sizing!
2.0,"Runs super small, not worth the money"
2.0,"Buyer beware:  This is a TINY, TINY charm.  It's about the size of a dime.  Would be good for a small child."
2.0,"I was excited to receive this dress.  Unfortunately, it runs very small!  I had to return it.  I'm 5'1"" and I could not wear it without something underneath."
2.0,"Very easy to break. I was putting one ring on and it broke, then being more careful I tried another and that one broke too. I'm sure I can fix it though."
2.0,Sent it back. nice material but wasn't what I expected.
2.0,This skirt was not floor sweeping as it said in the description. I returned it because it did not fit as it should have.
2.0,not a cute shirt.  The cut is very long and narrow over your hips. Falls much lower than the model.
2.0,"It's really cute but somehow someone managed to sneak a tuck on the lower half of the dress that made it look like a vagina had migrated to my lower abdomen.  Sadly, not a fashion statement I want to start."
2.0,"Truthfully, this product is difficult to recommend.  When it arrived, it was packaged in such a way that it was severely creased and wrinkled, and it is quite difficult to remove wrinkles and creases from PU leather without damaging the material.  Also, when tying/untying the tie, the material grips against itself rather than sliding easily, making it much more difficult to tie the necktie, and untying it is even harder to do still."
2.0,My wife was not happy the way it was made..
2.0,I like the quality of the product.
2.0,"The XL was extremely small on me, and I normally wear a size Large in shirts. The material is also quite thin; this is not a shirt that would keep you warm if that's what you are looking for. Return shipping is not free so consider that before you purchase."
2.0,Lost the pole/stick with 30 min on Halloween night.
2.0,Cute but broke easily. My boyfriend did love them(:
2.0,Clasp broke after several hours
2.0,I purchased a Da fit watch 2 years ago and loved it. Very accurate. This one smallest step you can choose is 30 inches. My stride is 26 inches. It wont stay linked w my health app. Wont auto up date blood pressure. The old one did all this. This one is water proof though and very scratch resistant. Old one was not. Just need a software update
2.0,It was small and easy to travel with but I needed an extra blanket and it did not provide much padding. Just ok.
2.0,"Zipper didn’t work, returned item."
2.0,"Pretty dress, but top too large for me."
2.0,I agree with other reviews that the top is entirely too tight.  I ordered three sizes larger than I normally would in hopes that it would be baggy but it’s not at all.
2.0,adorable piece of crap.
2.0,It was great at first but with one wash it shrunk so much it looked like a crop top on me. I had to put it in the donation bag.
2.0,I didnt notice just how off center the image is on the mask until I received it. You have to wear it so slanted to make it line up that it makes wearing the mask useless.
2.0,"I’ve ordered this twice. And if my nephew didn’t fall in love with it I wouldn’t be ordering a third one.<br /><br />First, the 8-10 size was too small so I then ordered a 12-14....it was even SMALLER. Problem is, there are no tags inside at all so I can’t tell which is which.<br /><br />I’m now ordering an Adult Small, (which is somehow cheaper ?) and he’ll grow into it.<br /><br />These are very cool, material is decent, design is good - but even for the reasonable price, lots of unfinished strings that I have to cut myself. They are rush made."
2.0,The bags were small
2.0,It lasted for like 2 weeks then the button ripped off. I don’t find it worth the money I spent on it.
2.0,"The main description says Leather Earrings. The details say faux.  I didn't see the &#34;faux&#34; and therefore am stuck with 4 pair of earrings that will most likely end up at the thrift store.  Bummed about it but, my failure to read the details resulted in the seller not willing to let me return them.  Not a lot of money was spent but still a waste."
2.0,"They look beautiful...for a few couple of month. I’m nit even sure if they are coated with gold and made of silver, cuz they turned black, and the front looks ugly because of weird rose-yellow spots. Very cheap. I wish I could return them."
2.0,fit's super small.
2.0,"Though product does provide heat the heat really isn't hot enough to relax tight muscles/pinched nerves as well as it looked. It is rather hard to fit for direct treatment. Everyone's neck not same size etc. Zipper doesn't do it. Think it would be better with Velcro adjustable strap to fit more tightly around ones neck. The hot setting really isn't up to par w/heating pad, but that too really doesn't fit a person's neck good too.<br />I personally would not recommend to someone with real neck pain."
2.0,Too small and pinched the toes badly.  Returned.  Really cute though - if you have narrow feet should be fine
2.0,"Very thin material,  not long enough"
2.0,"Cheap fabric, bad fit, save your money. Im size 16, bought an XXL, looked cheap and horrible."
2.0,"At some point after ordering, I expected to have issues with this hoodie. While waiting for delivery, the picture on my order has changed a few times and I wasn't sure what exactly I was going to get. This arrived earlier than expected - so that's a positive. With that being said, the hoodie that arrived was not the hoodie that was ordered. The print quality is just okay. The hoodie itself is made of a very thin material. I'm assuming that this came from over seas, so that was expected. Make sure you order up. This did not fit as expected either. I've requested to return this hoodie. We'll see what happens."
2.0,The product didn’t stay in place. Ended up losing because it fell out
2.0,"I sent this back as it made my mid-section look bigger.  I like the color and the v-neck look, all of that was nice but I just couldn't get past how the middle made me look."
2.0,Too tight so I returned them.
2.0,"The fabric is very good and light, but the style is not good for me."
2.0,"I didn't read the reviews until after I purchased.  I really wanted it for my son.  The watch arrived with a deep scratch in the crystal.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to make an attempt to wind it up.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed to discover that the watch was not working. Just as the other reviews said, this watch is a dud!  I'm happy for the 2 customers that it did work out for, so since I'm the 5th review, you have a 50-50 chance of receiving an undamaged watch that actually works!"
2.0,Glasses are very cheaply made.  One of the pairs arrived with a broken nose piece.
2.0,"The ears are cute but before I could even wear them the lace is coming apart and detaching from the wire in the ears at the bottom. Not sure what's going on with the veil in front it's only attached to the ears. And doesn't look very good. If I do end up wearing them I'm going to have to do some super gluing. Could be happier with my purchase. They are wearable (see picture below) and don't look too bad once you mess with them for a little bit but I'll probably need to iron down the lace somehow so it's lays flat and glue the edges of the lace to the headband. Unless you don't mind doing extra work to make this look like it's supposed to, I wouldn't buy."
2.0,Size didn't fit ...but if you are petite or for any small children it's a good choice...color was nice and the customer services are great
2.0,"It said it was a slouchy, baggy beanie. It is not. I have a small head size and it fits as a beanie should, not a slouchy beanie. Very disappointed in this as it was a gift."
2.0,"As soon as I received it, the batteries were dead"
2.0,Quality is not so great. It was good for a 1 time use. My daughter used it for Halloween and it served its purpose. After 1wash the material looked old.
2.0,"The design of this headband is really cute and pretty which is a step up from the regular<br />head bands I usually wear, they are one color and not very appealing. I always wear a headband it keeps me cool, keeps my hair out of the way<br />and I just really love them because it really beats doing your hair and just messing it up.<br />I really wanted to love this, but the simple fact that it has a death grip on your head is really not my kind of thing.<br />The force you have to put to get it on is ridiculous and isn't really the stretchable..<br />Another downfall is that your have to have it over your ears to even have a chance at staying your my head. (speaking on my behalf)<br />If I keep it behind my ear folds which I normally do because I hate things over my ears is very uncomfortable and just makes<br />me feel like I'm over heating.<br />It's really cute and the fabric feels very nice.<br />But personally for a retail price of $12. You are better off getting a pack of 3-4 headbands from Walmart for $6.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review, all comments, suggestions and opinions are 100% my own. Price reduction by use of a coupon or promotional code did not influence my opinion of this product, my opinion may vary from yours. I'm under no obligation to give a certain amount of stars and all my reviews are 100% honest. I do not have any association with any seller in any way."
2.0,Its not a french cuff
2.0,leaves a green rim around my ear holes
2.0,The image is of the fabric the first day I tried them on before even washing. The fabric is so cheap and looks like it's been worn a ton of times. Didn't want to go through the hassle of returning so i'm keeping as throw around shorts. I know they're cheap but even for $20 the material should not be looking like this.
2.0,"I sized up for a baggier look, and it still wasn't very long or off the shoulder. The fabric is a little stiff and itchy, but I think it will soften right up in the wash. I'm hoping to stretch the neck out a bit when I air dry it."
2.0,These are more like compression shorts than boxers.
2.0,"Very thin and very poorly marked.  I thought that I had purchased a branded shirt but it was really just some third party manufacturer.  Seams were sub-par at best and one arm hole is larger than the other (but thankfully, not by much.)  Would not purchase this &#34;brand&#34; again."
2.0,"They don't seem that warm, definitely not warm enough to get me through a Wisconsin winter. They smell very strange and leave your hands with the smell on them. Also some of the fingers are sewn shut so I can't actually even wear them. Will be returning"
2.0,"Just received them and they are huge. Very very wide. Also, a lot thinner than I expected."
2.0,Quality is not good. Pictures are so nice but actually product is matching in quality. I was disappointed.
2.0,Product was very cute but very small. I am usually a L in bottoms from Windsor so I decided to order a XL just in case and couldn’t even get it past my knees. No stretch. If you have a wider bottom I would skip this one.
2.0,"We loved these masks but the cords inside them are quite fragile.  We bought like 10 of them through amazon.  4 months in, 4 of the bands have broken and another is fraying to the point of breakage.  Not heavy hardcore use, just general use.  Love everything else, but the bands are too fragile for the price."
2.0,"Nice looking, well-made slippers, but clearly not anywhere near as big as the size 12 I'm accustomed to wearing. I held them up to the size 12 slippers I'm replacing (because the stitching is coming out) and they were a good inch shorter. I'm exchanging them for a size 13; we'll see if that does the trick. They were also fairly narrow. The low rating is simply because the sizing is wrong."
2.0,I only gave this shoe 2 stars because it still looks cute. They’re very cheaply made. They weigh next to nothing. The bottoms are very slick when walking. Definitely not worth $36.99. I wouldn’t have paid $10 for these if I saw them in the store.
2.0,This item did not come in the color it was supposed to be.  It will have to be returned.
2.0,I have been buying these socks for years but they have changed and I will not buy them anymore. The socks are shorter than they used to be and they keep sliding down my calves.
2.0,The top is really weird. Not a sizing issue - just awkward. Returning. Really wanted to love it!
2.0,"I wasn't expecting much from a $75 costume jacket, and I certainly didn't get a single penny of bonus value out of this piece. The construction is extremely poor -- right out of the package I noticed loose threads, strings of hot glue (yes, the chains are just glued on the front) and fraying, unfinished cord ends. The buttons have tangled wads of thread on the reverse. The buttonholes are incompletely cut, so it's also impossible to button the jacket without modification.<br /><br />Most annoying are the poorly-cut sleeves; I purchased this jacket to wear as part of a dance performance, but the sleeves are cut too short underneath, so it's impossible to raise your arms above chest-height while the jacket is buttoned. I am having to take the whole thing apart and add fabric gussets in order to have adequate range of motion.<br /><br />The only reason I haven't rated this lower than three stars is that given the cost of materials, I could not have made the jacket myself for much cheaper, so I don't feel like it was absurdly overpriced. Still, would it have been too much to ask to *sew* the decorations on instead of hot-gluing them?<br /><br />UPDATE: I've knocked off a star after actually wearing the coat for an evening. The threads holding the sequins on snag on the other sequins with casual movement, breaking them. I was shedding sequins all night, and now there are patches on the underside of the sleeves that are completely denuded of sequins. Also, two of the chains snapped while I was wearing it. Turns out some of the links aren't completely closed, so even sewing them in place is unreliable.<br /><br />Overall, this coat is a pretty awful piece of work."
2.0,Adult hat is too small for normal size head
2.0,"Put a pair on as soon as they were delivered to me. Fairly easy to put on; I liked the bar closure, but when I went to take them off that night, I realized that one earring was hanging funny. Felt around and discovered the clip part of the closure was still clipped onto the bar, but had come disconnected from the main part of the earring. After ONE wear, that wasn't even a full day's worth. These are pretty but don't seem to be well-made."
2.0,Looks great but I suspect the backing a aren't sterling silver because they began to make my ears itch.
2.0,"The fit was as expected and actually fit really nice, the problem was the material. It is shiny and cheap looking, reminds me of little girls dress-up princess dresses. The pictures look like a matte heavier stretch cotton material and the actual product is nothing like that."
2.0,"I didn’t expect much as this was so inexpensive.  I’m giving it 2 stars bc nowhere in the product description does it say that the when the mask is on, it continuously makes a beeping sound.  My son won’t even wear it bc the sound is so irritating."
2.0,"I'm a cosplayer by hobby. Let's be honest.... you get Mario's mustache, not Luigi's mustache... big difference. But you a variety of party mustaches that work well enough... I might be nitpicking though."
2.0,They do know look at all how the picture looks !! What a disappointment 👎👎
2.0,"Ordered based on the sizing chart, and my chest is a full 1 inch smaller than listed. As you can see from the picture...no way does the chest fit. The rest of the dress was fine so the chest just runs really small. Ordering up a size to make the chest fit would have made the rest of the fit look ridiculous. The color also wasn't as 'bright' and pretty teal as the picture showed. Lastly, and I knew it was 100% polyester going in to ordering it, but the dress has no stretch to it at all and really needs some."
2.0,"AWFUL!!!! Weird fabric, so unflattering!! I was dissapointed when I tried this on, fabric feels like  thick tissue paper ( if that makes sense). It doesn't lay right and puffs out in the front and back, plus a medium feels too big. I will be returning."
2.0,"I ordered my usual size and double checked the sizing chart, but the dress that arrived was super short and tight.  It looked much cheaper than the picture on the ad portrayed.  The fabric was too thin to hold its true color."
2.0,"I’m 5’10, with a longer torso. This top was almost a crop top on me. Lol<br />I returned it.<br />I would recommend it for someone that has very long legs and a very short torso."
2.0,Did not fit and not comfortable.
2.0,Cute but description is wrong small
2.0,This shirt needs ironing.
2.0,"la talla y el algodón son muy buenos, pero el vinilo del estampado no aguantó 1 lavado (con agua fría). terminé sacándolo entero y me quedé solo con una pollera blanca."
2.0,"these are pretty when they're laying correctly, but the fan part is not fastened onto the lowest part of the chain so they slide around and frequently end up sideways/lopsided."
2.0,"I received the incorrect dress, it was similar enough that I will still use it for a Halloween costume, but I was a little disappointed. Also, the dress I received had a really strong smell. I haven't washed it yet to see if it will come out."
2.0,I had to reglue the paw patches when I opened the package.
2.0,Incorrect size chart. You need to order 2-3 size higher for it to fit like it shows on the pictures
2.0,Jewels fell out and were at bottom of bag.  Needed to ship more quickly and needed to include matching earrings to complete this look.
2.0,the company is very good at returning items
2.0,"They're pretty but they're smaller than they say they are, I had trouble with keeping them in."
2.0,If these are men's sizes why when u pick the size it says big kids
2.0,Very cheap. You get what you pay for. Mine broke after second use.
2.0,"I have really sensitive ears and these are terrible. They were way too big, the backing falls off easily and the turned a milky color after only wearing them a few times out."
2.0,I bought these boots in black awhile back. However with pandemic no chance to wear. Between my daughter and I we wore 3 times. First was fine - great compliments. 2 time heel tips came off. Had them replaced. 3 rd time sole  unglued on right boot. Haven’t repaired yet. However very disappointed. They were a bit pricey to have these issues. And did love them and thought about another color. That isn’t happening.
2.0,"The puffy shoulders definitely are more of a problem than I thought they would be, it just looks odd. The fit isn't the most flattering either, don't try to size up"
2.0,"The pants fit great, and the reflective stitching on the seams was absolutely fantastic, definitely increasing visibility.  The zippers at the ankle were also good, with additional reflectivity, and the tights themselves were a nice middle weight, perfect for the ride I debuted them on: a century ride that started at 7 a.m. with temperatures in the low 50s that would climb to the low 80s by the end.<br /><br />all in all, a great purchase... Except that the pants ripped at the seam the very first time that I wore them.  if these had been better made, I would buy a second or even third pair, but as it is I am looking to return them."
2.0,"This was more like a bulky shirt than a shirt dress, could have been the wrong fit for me"
2.0,Printed image is much smaller than what is shown. Feels like a $5 shirt off of Shein. Do better.
2.0,This product looks nice. I kept it in the packaging it arrived in until I was ready to wear it. But I was not even able to wear it once because the clasp immediately broke when I attempted to secure it onto my neck. Disappointed
2.0,Too small...had to return.  Bought Fruit of the Loom instead and fit was perfect with the right size label for my size.
2.0,"color is not as deep as the photo, and the fit has stretchy fabric, which makes it fit tighter than the measurements. looks best in the photo."
2.0,"Poor fit, didn't keep my hands from getting cold at all and were pretty useless."
2.0,These pajamas are small.  The fly does not button so be aware of your audience. The flannel is nic and they would be comfortable if they fit properly.
2.0,"It looked great, but broke easily."
2.0,"Fits horrible, made for a person with with extended hips"
2.0,"I thought this belt would be very much like the others I ordered from ALLEGRA K. Unfortunately, it was smaller & not as well-made. I got a refund.<br /><br />Customer service was helpful, gracious, & very diligent. I will be returning to Allegra K for other things. I still like this store."
2.0,"I bought this for my mother who is 96.  She gets cold and wanted a shawl to wear.  She originally had picked out one from a flyer that came in the mail, but I read the reviews on it and people said it felt like the felt kids use for making crafts.  Well, this one didn't feel much better than that.  I was not thrilled with the quality of the item.  I really hoped it would have been thicker."
2.0,"I was hoping these would be the gold I ordered but some are gold and most were rose gold, which I did not order. Some of the septums  are too big and hard to fit to my nose because they don’t bend much ."
2.0,I ordered this shirt in a size medium I am always a size medium and it is really about a small for sure at least a small but could be an extra small it’s really small
2.0,"Unfortunately for such a cute and lightweight dress; it’s not fully assembled. At least mine was not. There’s a strap that was never fed through the back of the dress. I’ve never assembled clothing, but if you’ve ever lost the string out of your sweatpants and tried to feed it back through, imagine that.<br /><br />Not exactly what I want to be doing with a dress I just bought. I did try, probably for way too long, and I don’t think it’s possible for the average human. (Maybe some of you are above average, I must not be).<br /><br />What’s worse for me is that I didn’t realize this until after the return date. So now I’m stuck with this unusable dress. Unless I can find one of you above average humans out there... Not sure that it’s worth it. The quality of the dress is almost similar to that of slip, which is fine for the what I intended to use it for. Just a light dress. I guess we will see what comes of this. Really expensive rag or maybe you’re below average fellow amazon user will learn to sew and make something of this."
2.0,These are probably great for their design - sun and wind protection but not great as a mask for COVID protection. My daughter prefers the gaiter style to traditional masks with over the ears straps so I ordered these. They fit fine (she’s 9.5 years old) but offer no protection in terms of exchange of air. She was able to blow out a flame with the mask on.
2.0,Just started using and was disappointed. Ratchet mechanism slips.
2.0,"Great idea, but insulated lining gets caught I zipper and tears!"
2.0,Nice when new but gets dark very soon... poor quality :(
2.0,Too big...couldn't exchange for a smaller size.
2.0,Nice fabric but the sizing is way out of whack! I ordered the same size as LLBean pull on jeans and they are way too small. I'm disappointed.
2.0,These are very cute and soft to the touch.  Unfortunately they do not stay up on my kids faces.  I have tried pulling them higher in the back and they just continue to fall down.  A huge disappointment since that's the main point of them.  Would NOT recommend you to purchase.
2.0,smelled musty like it was used
2.0,Adorable shoes but run quite small for size 1. My daughter is barely wearing a 1 yet and these are too tight. She only wore them for an hour because they gave her aweful blisters
2.0,"just so thin, and blocky. Disappointed, but it does do what it says."
2.0,"Nice looking but pleather  sleeves peeled after wearing just once. I'd be mad if I paid more,  you get what you pay for I guess."
2.0,Poor quality workmanship.
2.0,The shirt fit great except the arms were crazy big.....haven't worn it because of that.
2.0,"Growing up a big Red Sox fan, I was excited to add this hat to my golf collection.  I love the look and feel of it, how you get your typical golf hat with Titleist on the front but it still throws in the Red Sox logo on the side.  It's not too overwhelming with the team pride, but just enough to show you're a fan.  Unfortunately the hat never seemed to fit right.  As much as I wanted to love this hat, I just could never feel comfortable wearing it for an extended stretch.<br /><br />I grew up wearing a hat every day until my mid-to-late 20s, and while I don't wear them often anymore, I do on the golf course, and comfort is #1 priority for me.  Unfortunately this one did not make the cut and has just become clutter over the years.  My Nike FlexFit is much more comfortable and always wins out."
2.0,Bottoms are tiny!  I ordered 2 different suits same size and these were literally 1/2 the size. Width about the  same but height wise it didn't cover my butt
2.0,WAY too small for my head. Good quality aside from that tho. I'll give them to my kid.
2.0,I love the look or design but this shirt is not as advertised (no cotton anywhere in site).  The look is still beautiful but the fabric is clingy.
2.0,Runs big!  Not as nice as expected.
2.0,I am a size 12 and bought a large and it was too small.  I would have had to buy a XXL to get the look of the picture. Plus I didn't like the fabric.  The picture makes it look very breezy and flowy but it's not. I returned it.
2.0,Fabrics...did not like spandex!!
2.0,"Poor material, very cheap and not true to color.  It is actually red not burgundy."
2.0,These are so very thin! Very cheaply made!
2.0,Purchased for my teenage son.  The rings are very small springs and look industrial they are not shined at all. The springs rolled off of his fingers again and again when he would do every day activities.  When they roll off they shoot into the air and across the room. The first day he broke one trying to take it on and off and he lost another one while goofing around with his friends.  I think they might be ok for someone who is not very active and is careful and slow when using their hands.  I will have to find a different kind of ring for my son because these simply don’t work at all for him.  The marketing and photos for this product are awesome but the product doesn’t live up to the marketing.
2.0,Honestly I like them but ! My straps came ripped hanging off the pants the fabric was tattered and I'm really bummed about it
2.0,"The material ripped right away as soon as you try on the outfit. Also, the zipper kept on rolling down as you move around in the outfit."
2.0,To small doesn’t work right when you strict out
2.0,Nearly all of these broke the first time I wore them
2.0,Again much too small--couldn't get them on.
2.0,Surprisingly small.
2.0,"For a 3XL men posted size, the actual product is sized for a child not a man."
2.0,Could not tell any difference
2.0,We loved them when we first got them.  But rook them out for Halloween and the wire connection went bad in one and he was deflated the rest of the night.  He had to use an alternate costume and he was so bummed.  Would like to get a replacement motor or costume.
2.0,"There was just way too much fabric,  probably  perfect for plus size ladies and would be cute."
2.0,"Pretty but Very small, very difficult to put on, hurt my ears and I never have a problem with other earrings."
2.0,"Fits alright length-wise. The unfortunate thing is that the seam for the crotch has been sewn down too far. This makes the shorts ride up your legs too high if you happen to be doing some stretching/calisthenics... exposing a little too much skin.<br /><br />Yes, this item fits the standards in AFI 36-2903. No, I don't recommend this item for the reason I mentioned above, though."
2.0,out of the package they are ok. the material is thin and once you wash them they shrink (and surprise you now have a crop top) I guess for the price I should not have have expectations.
2.0,Nice jacket over all my only issue is it already has a whole in the pocket and zipper is broke
2.0,"Love the laces- however, the gold ends were too big to fit through the lace holes in my converse shoes. Ended up having to cut the gold ends off and tape the ends to lace through my shoes. This proved difficult. They were also a bit short for lacing up an entire converse shoe, not much wiggle room for tieing afterward."
2.0,"Medal is nice, chain was all tangled up which makes it unusable"
2.0,"I ordered a size large, I’m a size D and it was still too small in the cup area, but a little baggy around. It’s very cute but sadly my under boob doesn’t appreciate it"
2.0,Half were deformed
2.0,Beautiful wallet but horrible quality. Used it for a week and a half and the zipper broke. 🤐 Sad I really loved this one.
2.0,"This works ok and is nice looking...  However, I much prefer the Mehr Classic Detachable Key Chain..."
2.0,Dress arrived in such a ridiculously wrinkled condition that it was unwearable. I have no idea how you would get the wrinkles out without having it dry cleaned.
2.0,"Calf too tight, thigh too small, waist and hips too big causing a poor and uncomfortable fit. The waist rolled down and the crotch hung down after a short walk. I normally wear a XS but read reviews to size up which I did and bought a Small. Unless you have skinny legs and big waist do not buy"
2.0,These would not stay up on my face over my nose! The fabric is way too silky.
2.0,"This handbag leaves something to be desired.  The leather is not nice and soft as many of the comments seem to suggest.  This purse is not worth the 35.99 they ask for it it more like a 19.99 purse.  I see in the price it seems to suggest that they are selling at a discount and that this purse is worth over a 100.00.  Nope, that is not the case.  If you want a real opinion and not one that has been brought and paid for read this post.  I will be sending this purse back.  This purse is not worth the money.  First time buying Hynes Eagles, do not know if I will purchase anything from them again.  Purchased to take to different military functions.  My husband works to hard to purchase crap."
2.0,"The graphic is beautiful, exactly what my daughter wanted. Unfortunately, they are super small. She is a teenager and while these claim to fit adults, I don't see how.  Its my fault for not looking at the actual dimensions before ordering.  I saw adult masks and just ordered. Make sure to measure for size before ordering."
2.0,"Ordered xtra large to have a bit of room. Nope too tight, not much give. I will keep them for when I drop a few pounds."
2.0,Too small ... It barely fits my teens arm too ... But very pretty and looks tough and durable...
2.0,Nice appearance but XL fits more like a medium
2.0,"Shirt pictured was different material. This is very cheap, rough, stretchy not chiffon. It's more polyester. Size was larger than expected causing v in neck to hang extra low."
2.0,Sized much too large
2.0,Most of the images were blurred and hard to see what they were. Especially the darker ones. The cupcake Unicorn ones are super cute though.
2.0,I have a very small wrist so it was hard to fit.  After getting it to fit my wrist it was very uncomfortable as it cut into my wrist in various places.<br />The quality of the band seemed nice.
2.0,It was way to small! I ordered a large. I wear a medium. So I had to give them away. You can everything through the shirt also  :(
2.0,The snap button came off.
2.0,"Nothing real special about it. Logo looks like a patch ironed/sewn on. Looks cheap. The hat is just a simple snow hat, nothing special. Keeps the ears warm though.  I would not recommend."
2.0,"The fit was great, the lace just didn’t look as expected"
2.0,It’s not that great tbh. Handles n all the straps around the bag feel like plastic. N logos do not align. One side has logos on the lower half of the bag only. You get what you pay for.
2.0,The fabric is nice and the color is great but the seams opened up in the first washing.
2.0,The fabric is unfortunately not something I would be comfortable wearing in public. Too shiny; looks costumey.
2.0,Sent it back. I was expecting the smaller size but the rose looked awkward. No issues with refund. 👍
2.0,not at all like pictured. much shorter!
2.0,Order size up. It constantly rides up exposing just the plain black tank underneath.
2.0,"Works fine for very light rain not moderate to heavy, a bit disappointing as the purpose of a raincoat is to shield you from the rain."
2.0,Turns out it was shirt and not a sweat shirt
2.0,"I bought an XL because i have big breast and wide shoulders. It fit more like a dress than a shirt. Quality okay, definitely would need to wear a tank top underneath, very see through."
2.0,"Dislike the rise, too small"
2.0,See through and the bottom rolls up and the dress rises up when you walk
2.0,"It was too small according to measurements, also it is very low quality but then again, the price is very cheap as well."
2.0,"I'm sure I had picked a size small, but it was wayyy to big and its' a really cute top. Sad I can't wear it now."
2.0,"The fabric description says it’s a cotton/polyester blend - and in parentheses, 95% cotton. One of the items was 92% cotton, per the label, and the other was 55% cotton, 37% polyester (rest is elastane). So neither of the items met the description, and one was way different fabric content. I really wanted 95% cotton.<br />Also, the label sewn inside the racer back is HUGE.<br />I did order a size up as others suggested - the tank top is a snug but comfortable fit (I got Large and am 115 lbs, B-cup, 5’3”). For me, the length is way too long - down to bottom of my thighs. I returned because too many issues and I don’t like being misled."
2.0,Pretty but back end  bends and breaks off so easy even no trying.
2.0,Cute in the pictures...but super matronly. Also came down to my calves. So not tunic top or even a mini dress. Also smells like cigarettes.
2.0,nice wallet meaning its pretty but it has been 3 weeks and the inside is ripping out! ugh
2.0,When I tried it on the style was similar however the sleeves were extremely puffy. It looked like I was wearing a costume so I returned it. It would have been great in a solid color but the puffy sleeves with the print was just too much of a busy look for me.
2.0,"The shirt quality is so-so. Fitting is somewhat smaller than expected, but works for my build. The cut hole is missing on the left cuff of the sleeve in which button should go in.<br />Nothing much in plus point except that I can wear it on very casual occasions if I am out of good shirts."
2.0,Nice but zipper broke on trip the first time I wore them.
2.0,very very cheap...dont bother.  The zippers did not wok and split open when in the zipped mode
2.0,What you see in the picture looks great. What they send you is on the bottom end of okay. The only way I can get this to keep its form is to wear another hoodie underneath. This listing is deceptive and this should be illegal. Pretty standard for Amazon though.
2.0,This wallet looks as if it had been wet at some point. The box was water stained. It left white powderish substance all over the back of the wallet.
2.0,Runs extremely too small
2.0,way too small; better for teeanagers/small children's hands.
2.0,The necklace is nice definitely isn't worth the price. Looks very cheep. When I gave the necklace to my boyfriend’s mom the card fell completely out on her lap wasn't a cute sentimental moment. I definitely wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,This did not cover up ANYTHING. I’d rather fashion a dress out of wet toilet paper because even that would cover more than this dress did. It’s also WAYYY too tight. And noticeably tight at that. Will be returning
2.0,Color did not look like the photo. It looked super faded and not a deep black and orange.
2.0,This is fake Lapis stone. I guess you get what you paid for. I should know. It dyed my wrist with a Blue color.
2.0,Bodice is too snug & skirt is enormous. The same dress in another fabric/color in the same size was actually too large in the bodice. Seems like quality control & consistency in sizing is lacking.
2.0,"I really liked this purse. It was lightweight and had 2 main pockets and zipper pockets on the outside.  I purchased this item in August and by October the strap came off (hubby fixed), then both zippers for the main compartment broke.  Thinking about buying another one, but don't want to have to replace within 2 months."
2.0,"I bought XL and they are TOO SMALL. I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 135 lbs. XL should have been on the big side, which is what I was going for since I have three children and am working on my figure. I couldn't believe that these were too short. They also don't fit like a compression tank should, there's no hugging in the right places...just a loosely form fitted shape to the shirt. Boo hiss."
2.0,Would be nice if it fit but it doesn't work well for D cups plus<br />Sticks good though for the amount of times I tried putting it on
2.0,This bracelet is large and gaudy.  Not my style at all
2.0,"It says that it is a fleece hoodie... it absolutely IS NOT!! It’s very very very thin. My daughter, whom LOVES batgirl, doesn’t even want to wear it because and I quote “Mom, it isn’t cozy fleece like my other sweater. And the ears don’t stand up. That said I would have returned it if she hadn’t immediately stained it.  Poor fabric, especially for little ones."
2.0,The stitching came apart within a year with light use. Contacted the vendor about their one year warranty and never even heard back.
2.0,"Some of the buttons don't have pins so they may not be used. Some of them has very rough edge so you cannot use them for delicate garments like silk blouse, scarves etc. Good idea but bad quality.  A little disappointed. In the end, I don't need that many buttons especially most of them are not in pairs, hardly in 3 a kind and none in 4 a kind . I wish they can focus on the quality instead of the quantity.  $10.99 for 20 good quality buttons is better 40 bad quality ones."
2.0,"I cut some of the material off it in the front, it was too floppy"
2.0,"These do not fit, your foot goes to the edge and your toes hang over"
2.0,"Love the band , but pins were too long"
2.0,"The product was meant for 7 women so I purchased mediums and larges. When I tried on a large, it was too small. I will have to return them mediums for large and XL. They were bought for a show we're producing in March and, if they're too big, when can take them in as necessary."
2.0,Cute style but material is thin and wrinkles up really bad after washing. Couldn't wear after they hung dried because it was so crinkled looking.
2.0,"They are very cheap looking, but for fun summer patio sessions they are still cute! They arrived all smashed in a tiny box, but I ""fluffed"" them out and wore them the same day. I'd say buy them if you're not expecting actual jewelry. The gold is plastic, but from afar you can't tell much."
2.0,"Shirt was more yellow than a mustard color, so wasn’t exactly what I was looking for, but still thought it was cute. Shirt was poorly made. Threads were hanging from bottom hem of shirt, as well as sleeve and had come undone. Never even wore it."
2.0,Quality of the mask is fine but the design is not well thought out because the NASA logo is partially hidden by the pleats due to its placement in the upper right. It's also a very large mask so not suitable for children or small faces.
2.0,"Cute Romper that I returned bc it was too short from the waist to the crotch. I am 61 yrs old & wear a size 6 in bottoms & I ordered a large. In all fairness, I didn't want a snug fit or camel toe.  The color blue was so pretty & the fabric was soft to the touch. I'm thinking about ordering an x-large lol"
2.0,Shirts are great but I ordered a 3 pack and only got 2 of them
2.0,Looks nice but stitching on leather area is coming loose
2.0,"These are nice and comfortable. It's a pack of 5 with two pins. They fit well in my Galaxy watch s4. However I did not realize until a couple months after purchase that the bands are all different sizes, with only 2 being a good fit for me."
2.0,This product wasn’t that great. I got it for my daughter for school. It was not the right color. Plus it was ripped before even taken out of the package.
2.0,"Ordered a medium based on other reviews about the size being too smart. The medium fit, and I mean fit. I'm usually a small.<br /><br />Love how soft it is. Love how big the pockets are. Even on medium it is really warm.<br /><br />Returned this because it's not efficient. I got the vest to be warm, not to be stylist. I ordered a far less stylist and comfortable heated vest as well and tested both with the same type of 20000 mAh battery multiple times.<br /><br />On medium heat, this vest only lasted 7-8 hours. The descriptions say it should last that on a 10000 mAh battery with medium heat. The other vest lasted 15-16 hours."
2.0,"They are just too big, and i have large glasses, but these are over the top! I've had these before that covered my large eyeware, but these are gigantic. I will not be wearing them. So sad."
2.0,Too big. Thin material. Weird smell
2.0,Way too big and hugs the wrong way
2.0,"I was dissapointed in the 3 items I bought for a friend's child's birthday.  They were of poor quality and probably won't last even as long as the movie is out!  The lantern was very cheap plastic and the handle came right off, the owl was sort of like styrofoam covered with feathers and just not of great, long-term quality.  Don't waste your money.  I had to give it to the kid or pay a lot for return shipping and have his present delayed even longer."
2.0,Measurements are way off! I’d size up by 2 sizes
2.0,The diopter has very little adjustment. So items are still blurry.
2.0,Fit was off too big and printing was poor
2.0,"Not pleased even though I only paid $5.00<br />I had to staple the straps to the purse, it came unattached to the purse. Very thin and very small! I like the color!"
2.0,I am 5'11&#34; amd 195lbs. 42B chest size.  I typically wear an XL/XXL.  I ordered this in XL and it was HUGE and unflattering.  Returning.
2.0,"When I received the product, I was thrilled with the fit. It made wearing my maxi dress much more comfortable by reducing thigh chafing and it fits comfortably, with no tightness, binding, or shimmying needed. I wore the item one day from 10am to 10pm under a maxi dress while I went to the Farmer's Market, did some light housework, and went to a children's birthday party. (Nothing strenuous!) I was comfortable all day! HOWEVER- When I got home that night, I noticed a 1-inch rip in the seam of the gusset of the garment. After 1 day of reasonable wear, I am very disappointed. I expected more from Spanx."
2.0,"You get what you pay for, though they're worth .99 cents as opposed to $9.99 ~ the set is completely see through."
2.0,"Short from the hips to the wast, the leg are normal.  Will not buy again."
2.0,"it is a cute skirt, but i ordered a size 10 and it fits my daughter who is a size 2.  and it was tight  on her...so back it goes."
2.0,Suspenders came broken and was smaller than expected.
2.0,"It fits expectedly small, as most foreign dresses do, so sizing up is necessary. I know my measurements, so the product's description didn't steer me wrong. I am 5'2&#34; about 170lbs and usually wear a medium or large in US dresses. A size XL fit appropriately, but it's too clingy for my taste. Even with foundation garments, it wasn't doing me any favors."
2.0,"Kids are wreckless, but when you make products for kids make them sturdy"
2.0,This shoe was way too large and didn't seem like a very good quality. Did not like the removable sole.
2.0,"These are not as they seem! I was looking for all leather gloves. These look beautiful (from one side), but the leather (albeit nice and soft) is only on the back of the hand (same on me for not catching that)! The palm is some sort of cloth and though the leather is tan-ish, the palm cloth is dark BROWN??? Very ugly. I have very small slender fingers (on slender thing on me) and they fit well, so I'll keep them. But I am on the hunt for truly ALL LEATHER gloves to replace the ones I ruined shoveling snow."
2.0,"Comfy - yes, ability to stay up - not so much, Fleece and warmth - not so much. The ""fleece"" is very thin.  Was hoping for thicker pants but really no thicker then regular leggings."
2.0,They are cute but did not stick on from the get go. Disappointing
2.0,It's advertised as a satin scarf but it's not. It does look nice and feels smooth but I wanted a satin scarf.
2.0,They ran small
2.0,"UPDATED REVIEW: (see below)<br /><br />Super light weight. My daughter loves them.<br /><br />I wanted something that wasn't pink for her but still girly. These aren't quite that as the color of the shoes themselves aren't as turquoise as I was hoping but we still like them and for $10, who can argue.<br /><br />UPDATE: my daughter has worn these maybe a handful of times and the stitching is already coming loose at the right foot toe.<br /><br />I had high hopes. So much so I ordered a larger pair but for $10 I suppose you get what you pay for."
2.0,Doesn't have a chest pocket.
2.0,I have a lot of these style bracelets. This one is dull and insignificant on its own.
2.0,"Such low quality. The ears aren’t even glued on all the way. Not sewn on, just barely glued. Fits more like a child’s set of ears, not well sized for an adult, as advertised."
2.0,"I like the item. However I ordered 2 items, but got only 1. Why?"
2.0,"holes are too small for th emouth and the eyes, difficult to keep"
2.0,"The material is rather cheap, short and clingy - all very unflattering, especially if you are over 130 lbs and that's being generous."
2.0,Love this necklace. Wore it with everything!<br />But it's so fragile it's my second one broken in 2 weeks span. 😒
2.0,"These socks hardly go to my knees, they are not nearly as long as the picture indicates."
2.0,"Don’t know how to tie it ,so I just tied it to the side"
2.0,"the ring is super cool, but I only wore it 4 times before the black started coming off and started rusting... finger was also turning green :( disappointed because it's so pretty!!!"
2.0,"Material is nice and silky, but WAY too small ... you need to size up at least 2 sizes from what the chart says ..."
2.0,I asked for a S size and the bottom is way to big for me. In addition material is heavy and it my not hold when in the water
2.0,The material is cheap. I expected as much cuz it was a cheap item. You can see my nipples for sure.
2.0,"Horribly sized. I'm not sure what product others recieved, but this cut terribly small through the shoulders, a problem I've never experienced before. Otherwise, the material was light weight, the seams were well-sewn, and the garment was fine."
2.0,"That is it. This runs way to small, by a couple sizes."
2.0,Doesn’t look like the picture and has the fabric of a Halloween costume.
2.0,too hard to put on and take off
2.0,"I bought this dress from my dad’s account, so here are my measurements for reference: I’m 5’5, 125-130ish pounds, bra size 32DD, hips 27”, and I usually wear a size 6 in dresses. I’m a bit of an apple shape, but it’s not super pronounced.<br />I’m attaching photos because no one else has, but I’m not a great photographer, nor is this dress a great look for me.<br /><br />Bottom line: The first thing my mom said when I put it on was “Well, that dress does nothing for you.” She’s right, but it will be culturally appropriate for an upcoming trip to Senegal, Mali, and Mauritania, and should be functional in the heat. I’ll likely get a few wears out of it and then leave it with friends in West Africa who will look better in it than me, which is fine at this price. I wouldn’t buy it again but it’s not bad enough to send back.<br /><br />Fit: Thanks to the previous reviewers who recommended sizing up! Large is the right size for me. The sleeves just reach my wrists, the hem grazes the bottoms of my ankles, and button up part fits well with no gapping. The elastic hits at just about my natural waist.<br /><br />Likes:<br />Modest - I bought this dress for an upcoming business trip to West Africa where I’ll need clothes that are presentable, modest, and comfortable in the heat. I really wanted to avoid anything that will require layering, and this dress hits the nail on the head there. The material is opaque enough to make a slip unnecessary, and I won’t need a tank top underneath the bodice as this shows no cleavage (it hits just below my collarbones at the lowest part).<br />Good for hot weather - During my trip it’s going to be 110 degrees F, and between the pattern and color, it shouldn’t show the sweat too much. The fabric feels like 100% rayon, so it doesn’t have any give to it, but it’s super light and breathable. It looks good with flat sandals and will be easy to pair with a scarf.<br /><br />Dislikes: The elastic at the waist feels a little tight, so I’m hoping it relaxes with time. It’s also an unflattering cut for my figure, maybe if the skirt flared a bit more and the top was less boxy I would look better in it. Although the pattern is pretty, it washes out my kind of pale features."
2.0,Cheap.  Metal had flaws.  Bird silhouette was poorly cut.  Was planning on giving as a gift but had second thoughts once it arrived.
2.0,The top is really cute but the bottoms are so flimsy. It’s literally just two pieces of fabric stitched together. It rides up a lot and twists around.
2.0,Ordered the pink purse but not the same shade of pink as shown and material is thin.
2.0,"I like that it’s colorful and the colors are brilliant in the website pictures.  But, the actual watch looks kind of cheap and tacky when received.  The band is really hard thick plastic, does not bend or conform to your wrist and it reminds me of a toy watch I had when I was a child.  The description is not inaccurate so I’m stuck with it.  The first person that says “I like your watch” is in for a surprise because I’m going to give it to them!"
2.0,Way too big and way too strong. There is no way somebody could wear this on daily let alone one hour. I am sure getting your actual nipple pierced is less painful. And I have a high pain tolerance
2.0,"Shoulders are cut really square so they get little ridges on fabric sticking up.<br /><br />Fourth time I wore it the zipper broke.<br /><br />The fabric is nice. Arms are good, not too billowy but room to move. Ordered a size over and it fits not snug but not loose.<br /><br />Zipper is going to make this go to the garbage prematurely, which is a shame. The zipper is too small for a jacket.  It’s a very small/ fine zipper. Before it broke it was hard to get the small end into the zipper pull because it’s so tiny."
2.0,"I was SO excited to get this dress.  But when I actually received the item, I was so disappointed.  I ordered a small and I’m 5’7”.  In the pictures others have shared, the dress goes to at least the knee, which is what I was going for, but on me it was several inches above.  The waist line hits a a really awkward place too.  It is a few inches above my waist so it’s somewhere between a-line and empire waist.  The actual fit on top was fine though.  I think short girls would love this dress,  but I wouldn’t recommend getting it if you’re over 5’3"
2.0,"The lights would not come on, even aftr leaving umbrella in sun for a full day."
2.0,"These are cute but unfortunately did not fit my 6 year old.  It's supposed to be 5-teenager age but I honestly didn't understand how it could fit a 5 yr. old face and a 14 y/o and now I know it doesn't.  Had to return because way to high on nose area and it kind of blocks her eyes.  Also, sides of face, around cheek area, are a little loose and exposed, so not a good fit all the way around."
2.0,"This case looks great, but it is very thin and flimsy. Had to order a different case to make sure my phone was protected."
2.0,"Updated 8/2020:<br />These poor pants are no longer, they didn’t make it a whole year before splitting at the seams. I have mostly washed these pants on gentle cycle so it’s definitely not due to abuse. I made one misstep and they split and kept going and going. Very sad to see these pants go, they were lovely while they lasted albeit VERY VERY small.<br /><br />Original Review 1/2020: I originally bought these for my boyfriend who wears a men’s medium to large usually, I ordered the extra large size and it was too small to even fit passed mid thigh. I ended up inheriting them, they are still pretty small they fit like a women’s size medium max. I usually wear a women’s size 4 pants. I love the pattern though and the material is light and breezy without feeling cheap or looking see through. They are great pants, they just run extremely small."
2.0,Looks and feels more like swim shoes. Very hard on the bottom. Too wide and loose
2.0,The top did not look like the picture at all
2.0,"They roll down which is very uncomfortable when you're working out. They don't have any kind of support on top to keep them up. They're soft and colorful and I like the pattern, but was looking for workout pants, and these are not for working out. They're probably more for lounging at home."
2.0,Bag color is not champagne or rose gold its<br /> actually yellow gold.
2.0,Runs small. I couldn't get it over my hand so was unable to use. Returns were easy.
2.0,"I loved these pants when I received them. They are nicely cut and the fabric is lovely but I just wore them for the first time and when I washed them (on gentle cycle) they tore at one of the seams, and the fabric is frayed so much they can't be repaired. So disappointed. :("
2.0,"I like the concept behind this dress, but there is way too much fabric. It looks frumpy. Sending back."
2.0,"Not sterling silver, made my ears itchy and inflamed."
2.0,Disappointed. It came with a bad chip. If you look at the pic they tried to cheaply fill it in. Looks sloppy ruins the whole look.
2.0,"I ordered an XL. I am 5'4"" and weigh about 220 lbs. I wear a mens size large shirt. These were wayyy too small. I gave them to my 13 year old daughter. Whose 5'7"", 115 lbs. They fit her well, but not as a compression tank. Just like a normal tank top."
2.0,The material is not what it looks like
2.0,smaller than I had hoped for. Thanks
2.0,"Liked it but they didn’t send the head wrap. Emailed them and they told me to send everything back. I didn’t do that all i needed was the head wrap, which i still want"
2.0,"I ordered the orange in a large. I am 5’7 165 lbs. this dress is long, it touched the ground when I was barefoot, wfuch I love long dresses, but this definitely dragged the ground. The material is like a spandex, clingy (in a bad way) material. It does NOT hang off the shoulder, if you did pull it off the shoulder it would look ridiculous. It’s an ok dress I suppose I could’ve kept it and maybe added a belt and did all that extra but for $30 no ma’am I want my money back! I want what’s in the picture! I couldn’t even take a picture as soon as I put it on I said “hell naw” off it went!"
2.0,"Cute but not as picture- for reference I am usually a s/m top and m/L bottom I initially ordered a small since that was the size recommended by Amazon- I received the package and the dress was relatively small but the area that bothered me the most was the length of the arms. In the pictures it shows a oversized looking sleeve. I returned an re-ordered a large thinking the increase in size would allow for longer sleeves- It fits exactly how the small fit.. I am not sure if they re-sent me a small on accident, unfortunately I can not check the size because it has no tag and the bag does not reference the size. The dress is cute and feels like good material but I think the material would shrink in dryer. I am really sad that I am going to return this item but sizing is completely off."
2.0,Super cheap and flimsy. Feels like plastic.
2.0,"Not as described.  Tag on garment says. 60% polyester, 35% rayon, and 5% spandex.  Also says 'hand wash'.  I will be returning."
2.0,Flimsy and fell apart. Bought it for my teenage daughter and it literally fell apart while she was wearing it. But what do you expect for such a inexpensive item!?! Buy at your own risk.
2.0,"Cool looking dress, but is somewhat see through."
2.0,"mom can't see she is elderly and loves it.<br />Wished the talking part lasted longer than one month. Been trying to get back off to see if it’s the battery, but I can’t. She asks me every day if I fixed it….?ughhhh"
2.0,The size was not accurate!
2.0,Nice tank tops but I found the run too large to be considered compression wear. I listened to others and ordered next size up and that was mistake. I will keep as I like them as daily tank tops but definitely not compression wear’
2.0,Polyester and just too thick for any shoe
2.0,It's huge and gaudy. The band is really ugly. Maybe this is just my opinion (and my 13 year olds). Ump... I'll buy a different band. But
2.0,"Very thin, you can see through the material."
2.0,Bleh... It turns rusty
2.0,Nope its definitely just a kiddie costume wig
2.0,"Ordered M but tag says L, too short, photo looks way below belt but the item is right on the belt. I like the material but comes short length wise."
2.0,Was shut a cute ring a week later ring started changing colors
2.0,It would have been cute if it didn't have sharp creases from it being folded in the packaging when it arrived. Returning for a refund.
2.0,The necklace broke and bracelet broke also after I took it off
2.0,I was so upset that I had to return this suit because it fit everywhere but the torso.  It was awkwaedly short.  Had it been a bit more proportionate I would've kept it.
2.0,I was very disappointed in my dress. I ordered a large. It is very small and certainly not a large. It also was not full as pictured in the photo.
2.0,"I like this jacket for everything EXCEPT the sleeves. Perfect length and just as pictured, but the sleeves were too short and normally sleeves are always long on me so if you don’t have that problem normally with sleeves, they will probably be like halfway up your arm... so sad because I loved this jacket 🥺"
2.0,"The first pair I bought broke really easily. I like them so I bought them again. They are cheap but, you get what you pay for."
2.0,La tela es muy mala calidad y los colores muy pálidos
2.0,Very cute but also very small. The XL is a medium at most.
2.0,They colors are very vibrant. It took me 2 hours to untangle all the waist beads. There is no clasp on them so putting them on over your head and looping is an issue.
2.0,The dress is pretty but the fabric too thin to wear in public. I kept it and wear it as a lounging dress at home rather than return it.
2.0,"The dress fit in the size I ordered, XL, but I just didn’t  like where the rouching hit."
2.0,I ordered a size to big an it was two sizes to small. It was a mini dress . An I'm 5'3
2.0,"I returned this item because in the picture it looks like a darker/mustard color and they are straight up yellow. In addition, there are shorts on the inside and you can see through the fabric. Cute but not what is pictured."
2.0,"Didn't help weight loss, just squashed me too much to move easily. Gave it away."
2.0,"These are very pretty earrings, but the box chain is so thin and smooth that the earrings won't stay in place. They were literally sliding back out of my ear lobes the moment I put them in.  I bought these to wear at my wedding and they'd be perfect except for this major flaw.  I'm going to buy some of those little rubber earring stoppers and give them a trial run that way, but sadly, I wouldn't recommend them based on this design flaw.  The manufacturer must be aware that their design doesn't work.  Why they wouldn't add a length of chain in the center that would hold well or at least ship these with rubber earring stoppers is beyond me."
2.0,"I LOVE backless strapless silicone bras. I'm a 36C and bras suck. I'm mostly against them because nobody cares if my back or breasts are supported - they only care that they can't see my nipples. I generally avoid wearing one whenever possible, but when I have to these don't feel like I'm even wearing one. They pull my breasts together and keep them from bouncing around without putting any pressure on my shoulders or back. Whoever thought of this design is amazing.<br /><br />That said... this one was terrible. It fit exactly as described but it was poorly made. Pro tip - get silicone bras with cut outs in the silicone. It allows the material to breathe and holds better even when you sweat. This one was not strong enough to pull my breasts fully together which wasn't a big deal for the three outfits I wore it with, but worth noting.<br />I wore it for an event and after two hours the bra completely lost stickiness and slid up my breasts. It probably would have fallen off except my top was tight and kept it pressed against me, but my breasts had totally fallen flat. I had to adjust every hour or two for the entire event.<br />I wore it again today for a photoshoot and had to adjust the string twice for the two dressed I wore. Each time I adjusted the string (never pulled it taut) the material covering the pad starting to separate. It worked out okay for the photoshoot but I won't be able to wear it again. And the silicone isn't even sticking at all anymore. I threw it out when I got home.<br />I honestly would have just ordered the brand I had used in the past but they're out of stock so I figured I'd try this. Good news - I learned what works for me! Bad news - I wasted $15."
2.0,Definitely like the colors together but it it very thin and flimsy. The first time it catches on something it will snag and fray.
2.0,"The blue color is lovely and the bottom half of this dress feels so floaty and elegant, but the waistband was oddly stiff and scratchy, almost like it had cardboard sewn into it, and the top half was weirdly voluminous and made me look matronly and bulky. Nah, bruh."
2.0,way to thin to be effective for anything other than peek a boo.
2.0,"Usually I'm very happy with Amazon's products, but this time I was rather disappointed. The product came in a dull color different from what was presented, the straps felt tight and dug into your skin, and overall just looked like it's been heavily bleached. It was disappointing"
2.0,These shorts are extremely baggy! I usually wear a small and that’s what I purchased and was highly disappointed.
2.0,"These shoes look great on picture. Once received we realized the shoe opening was very small. The laces are not adjustable, so my daughter couldn't even squeeze her foot in. Unfortunately, we had to return."
2.0,"It is not as durable and tough as I expected from Samsonite.  The strap is flimsy, overall construction flimsy."
2.0,Fabric is very thin. Size is big. I ordered a small because size chart indicated small was size 4. I should have ordered an extra small.
2.0,I wanted to love these they felt amazing but not good for short woman.
2.0,a great value but they are small but sturdy
2.0,"I wore it once and the threads starting coming off., doesn't stretch a bit! It is not an oversized sweater if you are looking for one! Poor quality!"
2.0,Pretty color and style but SO SMALL. Took 6 weeks to get here so shipping back is just annoying.
2.0,Not good quality.. fit was very bad.. my husband is an XL and this seemed like a XXXL
2.0,The quality is not what I expected.
2.0,The gold coated parts started to peel within a week.
2.0,Gave it to stars cause its pretty but fell apart as soon as I opened the package lesson learned with this one
2.0,"Thin straps gave it the dreaded ""back fat"""
2.0,"There does not seem to be any way to adjust them to my feet.  I would love it if someone could tell me or if they had some type of instructions in the box.  Currently, I can't wear them"
2.0,"Super cute, but was too small for my daughter, ordered xs she is normally that size in junior’s clothes"
2.0,"The color was not a pretty pink, it looks more like a granny nightgown."
2.0,They did not fit as expected. The arch was too high and my feet leaned in an awkward position.
2.0,Love my other La Cera gowns but this one is a big disappointment.  It runs small compared to other M.  In fact about two sizes smaller.  Fabric isn't as it was.  Just too late to return as have already worn.
2.0,"This product didn't last a month, the screws are loose. i wore it out someday and the screw fell off. i didn't bother looking for it, i just threw the glasses away since it's cheap anyways, but it's very pretty"
2.0,"The Almond Blossom is much darker in the picture than it looks, not impressed. Starry night, Rainbow colors, and black with feathers are pretty decent though."
2.0,"I have chosen this item because of it unusual design. I was unpleasantly surprised with its small fee(I am sixe 2-4 , and they claim this is sixe 6) and it is very tight. The quality is poor too."
2.0,"The arrived dress (sleeveless, orange) had a tag &#34;one size&#34; and was too large for me. I've ordered the size M.  So, I even cannot say what size it was. It could be good for the seller to indicate that dresses are &#34;one size&#34; and do not trick people with size choose option."
2.0,Way way bigger than pictured! It was really cute but just about the same size as me.
2.0,very hard to remove the PU leather smell
2.0,"This item is beautiful. But the cut is wrong. The dress fits perfectly but where the see-through mesh  is, was cut is way too low. It exposes quite a lot. So we need to return it."
2.0,We found them very flimsy and they were not very sturdy when fitting the poles together
2.0,"I wish I could have understood how small these are. I can't imagine they would fit anything bigger than a tiny string. I don't think they could work for backpacks or anything like that.  I tried to fit a small strap from a mask through the largest and it couldn't fit at all. I needed the opening to be big enough for TWO straps.<br />My fault for not knowing what size I should have been trying to find. Those cm and mm numbers just confuse me. So don't blame the seller, it just wasn't what I was looking for and I took a chance they would work. Will donate them to a friend who does crafts, maybe she can use them."
2.0,"The product is great quality! However, if you don’t like the waist being tight, don’t buy these. I bought them in a large thinking it wouldn’t be too tight. Nope. It’s tight, not uncomfortably tight but I’m too fat and have too much stomach fatness to have a waistband squeeze me and exacerbate my fatness."
2.0,They look very nice on me but the pants were way to long.  Had to return them.
2.0,I thought the diamond was going to show but it doesn’t. Had to bend it to make it look decent. I’m sad because I had an imagine in my head.
2.0,you have to press a button on the side to see the time. it would get 5 stars if the time were always being displayed. I'm really not sure why they made a watch with an extra step to see the time. That's the whole point of a watch.
2.0,The stiff feel and shapeless style of this jacket did not resonate with me. It's going back.
2.0,The necklace was very pretty but much to large for my small granddaughter
2.0,Fabric nice enough and fits as I expected; I ordered Plum color- sadly I got a dark purple instead. Back it goes.
2.0,Very comfortable! I ordered the two pack. Unfortunately the gray pair arrived defective with a big hole in the crotch.
2.0,"Cute but no support, returned it."
2.0,Everything is kind of cheap and the vest is tiny.  It would fit a size 2 but that’s about it.
2.0,Smaller then the picture shows
2.0,Nice shirt...poor sizing
2.0,"It's beautiful. However, it is just too heavy. I could probably wear it for maybe 10-15 minutes to take some pictures in it, but no longer. I'd recommend to make it in a smaller size, if it would help to minimize the weight. Also one of my earring back broke. Oh well, at least it's something easy to replace."
2.0,They broke in 3 days. Seams came undone
2.0,Material is not holding up well.
2.0,Too tight. Always wear large and it was tight
2.0,"I don't know if it was because of the shipping... but the string broke and the beads were scattered when it arrived :( I just had it fixed at a bead shop in a mall. If not broken, it looks awesome"
2.0,Doesn’t clearly look like a snotty nose. Bought it for my dad as a joke and you really have to look at it to see what it is and by then it’s like eh.
2.0,Too cheap and light..
2.0,I was excited to try this sports bra because I love the longer lined ones but it's SUPER TIGHT. If you're looking for something to minimize yourself then this is definitely what you're looking for. Otherwise I would recommend that you size up!<br />It was pretty stretchy to get on and comfortable Otherwise. But not something I could comfortably wear around the house for a few hours. :(
2.0,It's okay beautiful color. It is a mini crossbody.
2.0,Not looking good.  Shipping sucked.
2.0,I’m not going to send it back but for future reference. Please be more careful because my beads were falling out everywhere.
2.0,Not true to size. Will be sending back today.
2.0,Good hat but the slide out side pieces fell out pretty quickly but if you just want a visor it’s good!
2.0,"Two pairs and still too small, even after ordering a size and half bigger than what I normally wear."
2.0,It was a nice enough looking ring for a month and a half and then I looked down and was missing the opal.
2.0,Not great. Like the embroidered  message but that’s about it. I don’t have a large head and the cap barely fits had to take the strap out full length. Bill on cap too small.
2.0,"The dress fits alrights, and the pattern is cute. My issue is the material. In the pics it looks like a sturdy cotton blend, it's actuall a very thin satiny feeling material (reminds me of the parachute we played with in gym class). I'm still deciding if I'll keep it or return it."
2.0,"My husband loves Original Grain watches.  I bought my husband one of the Brewmaster watches about a year ago. A finishing detail/mechanism inside the watch has come undone. I will send pictures. Please advise on the next steps, Amazon or Seller."
2.0,Pretty dress. Soft material. I am a small. Ordered a small. Way way way to big
2.0,"Hatred it,  looks nothing like the picture, bad quality material.  Save your money!"
2.0,The thorns from the rose bush come through!
2.0,"Ok, i dint know if it was siblngs, cousins, aunts, uncles whatever, who wrote the reviews on these waders, but, the fit is rediculous!<br />I am 5'4-5"", 150 lbs, female, size 81/2 shoe, wear a size 10 to 12 Lucky Jean.  I have very long legs for my height...and this Medium absolutly Swallows me!  Even with straps shortened to the max, the legs are a good 8 to 10"" too longand seriously bag 4-5""wide.  And the neoprene stocking bootie is 3""(!!) longer than my foot(like a man's size10-11) with a width that could fit a Clydsdale...yet, true to Chinese made clothing, the hips fit almost right.  This would probably work well for a 5'10 to 6' man, 190-200lbs with wide, size 10 to 11 (or bigger) feet.<br />The med wt. fabric and workmanship seem good. Design of pockets good.<br />I will be returning this and finding an American made set (with American sizing)."
2.0,"I contacted seller prior to purchasing, asking if there was a recent manufacturing problem. It seemed that reviews were good, then suddenly complaints about quality. Namely, the green having straps sewn on unevenly, one side long, and one side short. It also seemed that size had begun to vary. I looked at reviews of women of my height, weight, and measurements. Some were sent Mediums that were too small and some too large. I explained I did not want tight not baggy. I gave seller my measurements, height and weight , 5’8” 142lbs 35.5-27.5-36.5. Seller advised Large. Well... Take a look a my photo. One strap “is” long and one short. Also Size Large is too big. It is baggy.  I wasted my time reaching out to them. I tried to avoid the hassle and time of returning, to no avail. Returning."
2.0,Purse was pink. Not red at all.
2.0,It wasn’t as distressed looking as the picture showed. Very thick decal.
2.0,I was disappointed to receive this shirt. I loved it but didn't fit @ all. Especially on the inderarm area. Had to send back
2.0,The discoloration caused the earrings to lose their appeal!!!
2.0,The top cups run very small. Not full coverage like in the picture.
2.0,"The sizing is very small for a sweatshirt.  Love the fleece lining for the warmth, but the sizing AND the quality of the material made it unusable for me"
2.0,"I bought this mask when it was $9.55. Now it's $23.88!?!<br />DO NOT BUY!!!<br />I wouldn't even buy it again at $9.55. I got it to cure the problem of my glasses fogging with other, non-vented masks. Doesn't work. Glasses still fog. Also, material is too thick to inhale OR exhale through the nose, so now I'm a mouth breather. Can't use earloops, too small. Only giving two stars because it seems fairly well made, and the behind-the-neck attachment is more comfortable than my other masks.<br />Also, didn't receive any extra filters. Maybe they knew I'd be unable to use it anyway, so didn't bother sending extra filters..."
2.0,So soft that a baby could snuggle with it...which is the problem.<br /><br />This is not a belt in the traditional sense. Maybe something for posers to where while looking tough. Why do I say these things?<br /><br />I carry a swiss army knife on my belt...the belt is so soft that the knifes weight is actually bending the fabric of the belt over...<br />100% junk. Even the buckle which looked nice in the photo is horrible at doing its job.<br /><br />Buy this if your going to a fashion show. Avoid if you want to work in the yard or god forbid take it to the woods.
2.0,"While the rainbow portion matches the picture, the plastic pieces do not. The pieces that attach to the watch are a mint green and the piece that adjusts the size is clear. In the picture on the product page, all plastic pieces are black. Unfortunately, the mint green really clashes with the light blue of my watch."
2.0,"I did not like them, too wide, too short did no stayed on and unraveled at first wash"
2.0,"These are cheap and break easily.  Putting them on my hat caused them to snap right above the lense on the thinnest part, lens falls out.  Wore them sporadically for 3 months before they broke."
2.0,"Runs much smaller than expected and ordered a XXL for a fit, but tall 6' son. Odd feeling material  - doesn't seem durable. Imagine it will rip easily and should never be machine washed and definitely not placed in drier."
2.0,Fabric is no good. Feels very synthetic almost plastic like.
2.0,Was not made very well and tore apart in less that a weeks time
2.0,"Ok for men, too big for women."
2.0,Love the colors but it run very small and also sEwing is done badly. It kept twisting around
2.0,Size is m to big
2.0,"It looks better in the picture.  The quality was not as expected. I thought I could wear this to the store; however, I can only wear it indoors as a house dress. Additionally, it is not at all warm as they indicated in the descriptions."
2.0,"Way to small and it’s swimsuit material. If you have any bumps anywhere this will cling to it. It’s not at all forgiving, it’s cheap. I guess if you were running around a swim park party and you thought you may get wet, this would be the only place I’d ever wear it."
2.0,It was terrible. The material is very thin and the dress had no angle or shape to it at all. I wouldn't buy it again.
2.0,Luv the colors but didn't like the white and black too attach mixed like that they should only used black attachments
2.0,They were not true to size. Was stated to be 48 but all three measured 42. Disappointing.
2.0,"I love the style of these jeans, but I don't think they're cut correctly for anyone. I'm a short person, just under 5'4, and I ordered these jeans in a medium. (I am usually a small or a medium and there wasn't a clear size guide, so I went up just in case) They fit high on my waist and were at least two inches too short. They looked extremely strange this means they would be even worse on anyone taller than I am, and these weren't even the smallest size. Unless you are short (5'2 and under for the medium I believe), these jeans probably won't fit you properly."
2.0,Said above the knee but it’s below the knee.  Very thin material.
2.0,"The stitching doesn’t look like it will hold, I purchased a second pair that was already coming apart. They also don’t feel like real leather, but maybe it’s treated with something that makes it feel weird. The packaging is very nice though."
2.0,"The material and fit of the shorts were fine.  However, the padding is completely misplaced and a bit thick. It needs to move forward at least a couple of inches. I’m giving them another try in a few minutes and will update if this changes but I think these might be unusable by me, at least."
2.0,"The dress itself in person is pretty. Not gorgeous, but it was going to get the job done. The material felt cheap, mostly scratchy tulle and a very rough crocheted weave on the top, with large gaps in the pattern. The arms run EXTREMELY small. This dress is not meant for anyone who has bigger arms. Even the largest size's arms were small in proportion to the rest of the dress. I can almost promise that if you try to stretch it at all, you will rip it. The only reason I gave this dress two stars is because the return process was very smooth and easy."
2.0,way too small....
2.0,Eh..tarnished wayyy fast.
2.0,It broke like right away
2.0,"Doesn’t work. It says to leave this on your glasses and let it dry. It leaves a nasty film on them though, where it’s hard to look out. Glasses look dirty after."
2.0,The fabric was so noisy I didn’t even try the dress on! I got pink and thought it looked too youthful. If I had loved the color or print I might have tried it on.
2.0,"Sold as Happy Lens, They ARE NOT happy lens!!"
2.0,much cuter online than in real life. just too big.
2.0,"One expects clothing to look better on the model and fitting problems after trying things on. Online clothing shopping adds color surprises, material disappointments, and quality problems not apparent online. For the convenance one might succumb to the temptation of purchasing a cute looking dress online.<br />Once you get the dress in hand and the color is not even close to what you saw online, or it fits all wrong, or the material is similar to cheese cloth, or you pull a loose thread, and the sleeve falls off.. You better be able to return the dress as simply as possible. Not so with this dress. The easiest way to return the dress was finding a suitable box;  printing return instructions and shipping label; opening the box I just taped up because the return authorization needs to be in the box; retaping the box; figure out a method for attaching the shipping label; driving 6 miles to UPS; waiting 15 minutes for the UPS clerk to accept the package and print a receipt; return home; and finally make note to never buy clothing online again."
2.0,"Looks great, but you get what you pay for. The color is coming off of the underside of the watch. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,The shiny part is actually detached like an itchy bra . Doesn't appear that way in the picture and runs very small
2.0,Very thin. Rip easily.
2.0,"I ordered a 3X because I am a 38DDD with a smaller waist. I got the 3X and it fit my waist, but the cups were literally the size of apples. I am not joking. Plus you couldn't squeeze the boob elsewhere like you can in other corsets because this one had specific cups for the boob.....so there was nowhere to go but out. Very odd fitting. Don't think it was made to go on a real human. lol<br /><br />Returned."
2.0,"These pants are not what we expected. They run tight and small for the size. The material is ok. But the main issue is that the string to tie the pants around your waist is only attached on the front half of the waist. The rear half of the waist is only elastic, so no matter how tight you tie the string, your pants will fall off if you put your phone or wallet or keys in your pocket. Ask me how I know...<br />Bottom line is you can find better quality pants at Walmart for less money."
2.0,"I usually wear a Ladies large (12/14)  is due to comments ordered a XXL. I should have ordered a XL. However even if it fit, there were a few disappointing features. The fabric is thin, too thin almost see through. Also, the armholes are so large that much of your bra shows. Lastly, the buttons look cheep. I will be returning this blouse."
2.0,Too redish for my tastes.  More maroon than brown to me.  Smaller leather strips don't go all the way to edge of band.  Also don't cross over each other.  Lost this same bracelet a few years ago and it was much cooler than this one.  Looked like one pictured.
2.0,Dark Blue Layered Dress Review-Super duper tiny. I wanted to love this dress-even had grand plans for it. But alas-it was just way too small. As in like 2-3 sizes. It was also not billowy-it was straight down.<br /><br />Return was great and received our refund without any issue!
2.0,"Flimsy material, stuck zipper, order 2 sizes up! I am an 8 and the medium was way too small."
2.0,"I am bigger around my torso. It fit fine but my complaints are that the fabric is too thin, the high low hem line was very low in the front and back (lower than in the picture). The side hem came above my knees and the low part too far below my knees. The color was more grey than the picture."
2.0,Lights stopped working pretty much immediately. We’ve tried recharging and pulled the sole out to make sure wires are properly connected but seem to have one shoe burn out and stop working constantly—even with being charged.
2.0,cloth is way to big to handle had to cut it into several pieces
2.0,It definitely runs large. A large felt like an XL. It has the potential to be really cute but it runs large and the fabric is itchy. I had to return it.
2.0,Bought a pair for my daughter and one for me. They're more sheer in both sizes than I expected. Definitely not squat proof. Will keep them to wear around the house.
2.0,"Was looking for a large-face, easy to read watch and this seemed to be it. Had to send it back because it didn't keep time. Isn't that a watch is supposed to do? You get what you pay for..."
2.0,Ripped in the washer after two washes ...but it did keep me warm and fit well
2.0,"I bought 2 of them for My Mother at Xmas.They were so fine she was afraid to wear her pendant with them.I ended up giving her 2 of my heavier ones.I would have returned them,but the price was mainly shipping!"
2.0,"I have always wore a medium in a open face helmet. But, this medium is smaller than any medium I have ever put on. I have learn my lesson as to buying a helmet online when there is no free return policy. The helmet itself is a very good product, and well made. Would recommend if the sizing was spot on."
2.0,"Fabric is very thin. Might be wearable as a nightie, but not something I would wear in public.  I appreciate that the company accepted returns."
2.0,Thin fabric that didn’t hold shape. The Yellowstone logo was a stencil that wasn’t very dark.
2.0,"It looked good but broke within 2 days, he was just putting it on and it snapped."
2.0,"Super cheap looking, even more so than I expected for the price."
2.0,I question if these are IZOD or knockoffs? I have previously purchased this brand at local store.  The elastic waist is much cheaper in these. Also does not have IZOD on inside. I purchased these because the other have worn so well.  These are should wear after one wash!
2.0,Pattern weird.  I bought as a gift. Not sure if recipient will like or not.
2.0,Novelty watch great for teenage boy as their first show off watch.
2.0,Material was very thin and suit was very large
2.0,"So I ordered this nose ring a couple weeks ago. I was supposed to get two but only got charged for one, when I specifically put down two. Luckily though, that was good because I wasn't satisfied with the jewelry at all. It kept getting caught on my pillow when I was sleeping & getting ripped out, would also get caught on towels & blankets, etc. causing my nose to become inflamed & swollen. That was the first time I tried a nose bone & needless to say, I'll never use one again."
2.0,Way too big for size
2.0,"So disappointed in this purchase. I bought this belt for my dad. It ended up being the wrong size. When we sent it back to return, we were later told the belt was discontinued."
2.0,"Received Saturday 8/25, and washed same day. Wore pants Sunday 8/26 and they have lint fuzzies all over the pants."
2.0,Faded after first wash. Cute suit though.
2.0,I bought these goggles due to the great reviews.  I bought 2 pairs for my wife and I.  They are SOO bluRRY.  Isn't the point of goggles is to be able to see out of them?  Soo disappointed!  There's $7 goggles that are WAY better than these.
2.0,"The shirt had wrinkles when taken out of the packaging. No matter how many washings, ironing, etc., the wrinkles remain. Not recommended."
2.0,"Fit well, but material is thin"
2.0,Poor quality. not appropriate for athletic use
2.0,Made it two flights. Not sure if it was the airlines fault but broke a wheel off!
2.0,Bracelet is ok.  Words are difficult to read and the charms continually fall off so I have not worn it much because the charms fall off.
2.0,it keeps count of around 35 days in a month so it has to be reset every month
2.0,Would've been fine if it wasn't so big. Will need to alter it.
2.0,Got a xxl - my friend who wears a medium can fit in this better than me. I usually wear xl but figured they ran small. Even stretchy- no way. I think they might be children sizes only... Except they were super long. They are also a weird plastic texture so perspiration would have been an issue...
2.0,they're OK. I wish they were a little bit thicker.  The company needs to be more creative with the packaging and make it easy on the customer to pull and store the Bibs.
2.0,"Sharp edges that could cut your finger if not careful. Holds roughly 20 cards. Not as pretty as pictured, without the gold highlights. Not sure if it’s just the one I got, but the corner has already peeling when received it."
2.0,"I'm 6' tall, 165 lbs. These don't even come close to fitting. I can wear it over my nose OR or over my chin, but not both. If you have a small face and small chin then these may fit you. I feel like they are 20% smaller than other universal fit masks. Not for strong chinned individuals."
2.0,If you can size down I would. I’m always a small in all leggings but there were toooooo big in the legs. They bunched up at my knees and ankles.
2.0,It was broken (the second chain) when I received it and then it broke completely within 3 days :( otherwise it was super cute.
2.0,I don't like the material. It not very soft and the hook in the front is too spaced out.
2.0,I wanted the waist band to be cotton for my kid and chose this. But it became too loose after 2-3 washes. Liked the material but not useful.
2.0,Did not fit and had to be returned.
2.0,"I've purchased the navy blue in this shirt and It seems a little too soft and feminine for my taste. As I am a masculine male and it doesn't give off that aura of a masculinity feel to me. I am 6'0 and 185-190 lbs.  Athletic build and I have purchased a large. I like my shirts fitted but this fits uncomfortably tight and short. I like an abstract look and I'm not totally against pink colors on males, but this pinkish color paisley design seems a little too distasteful for me. I will be returning.."
2.0,"Good quality but caused sunglasses to fog over. Couldn’t find a position where this didn’t happen, so not using these. Too bad. Looked good and nice material."
2.0,I'm not to impressed .
2.0,Nice idea but I could barely get an XL over my shoulders...let alone past my waste.  Bought two colors and had to send both back.
2.0,"Very disappointed that the ring my daughter wanted shows hardly any opal colors whatsoever and mainly just looks like a very small, thin band."
2.0,It broke in less then 3 month
2.0,"The ring I received is stainless steel and the quality I expected. So two stars because... although it is a spade ring, it is a different style then the image shown. I could’ve bought the ring I received through prime. Good ring. But not the specific ring I wanted and ordered. Size was correct."
2.0,First day of wear and the pair worn has a hole in the heal! It's probably worth it to pay a bit more for a pack of socks from another seller or a larger retailer.
2.0,I loved it until I washed it. It fit great at first but after I washed it shrunk. I didn't dry it and I followed the directions on the tag. Now it doesn't fit:(
2.0,This skirt is no where the same in picture. It's a different pattern & the bow is much smaller than actual picture.
2.0,"Looks like a 3D glasses; bought it for $15, sure, you may get almost same look/quality for a cheaper price. Besides lenses are really small."
2.0,Not the best quality looks better in the picture.
2.0,Material was way to thin. Looks cheap and unflattering.
2.0,"Returned, colors are attractive and cheerful however, I expected socks to be thicker and cushioned they are thin."
2.0,"I usually LOVE the 90 Degree yoga pants. Great pair of yoga pants for any price, let alone this great price! They stay put on hikes, runs, and in yoga! I would have given five stars, but the most recent pair I ordered has been worn and washed exactly one time, and there is already a huge hole in the center seam. I am hoping that the quality of these pants is not going down hill! Used to be my go-to pants, but even at this price... not worth only being able to wear them once."
2.0,"I got this suit and another from a different company. The bottoms on this were way to small,  while the top was way to big.  This suit would look great on someone more fit with huge breasts. I'm 5'3, 145lbs, and wear a 36C bra."
2.0,Cheaply made. Not as cute as pic.
2.0,This is the equivalent of buying a yard of fleece from a fabric shop. Looks like you’re wearing a blanket. I’m giving two stars because it was super warm and soft and would be great for just in the house but pretty pricey for something you wouldn’t leave the house in. Ordered a small and it was enormous.
2.0,The dress is so beautiful. Its more red than burgundy. But i almost didnt care. I ordered it for my maid of honor in a size 16. It fit me.... A size6-8. I had to return it.
2.0,The lava rocks are more like plastic
2.0,Beautiful watch  but consistently runs slow
2.0,"The fit & stretch are as described, but the quality of the material & workmanship is low.  I turned up the hems & opened a little slit at the ankles so that they look a little less shabby.  These pants are blue, but barely denim.  They're worth maybe a third the price charged.  I won't be buying anything from this company again."
2.0,"We really liked the watch but are returning it. It stops when the second hand meets passed over) the minute hand, sometimes it doesn't stop but it wouldn't keep time."
2.0,Cute but arrived with one large  jewel already missing. Great for price!! Lots of compliments 👌🏼
2.0,"Look and feel good, but within 2 months I was finding socks worn threadbare in areas. Don't hold up and shed black lint on your feet for all eternity."
2.0,I could not get it on and it is extremely see through ... would have to wear a slip underneath and it defeats the purpose of<br />a sleeveless summer dress !  I returned it.
2.0,Very delicate design and construction order various pairs two broke easily
2.0,Very dissapointed. Received this today and the necklace was broken and the ribbon around the wand unraveled within the first hour of playing with it. My daughter was not playing rough at all and it fell apart. The skirt and the wings were nice but extremely dissapointed in the broken necklace and crappy wand. My daughter was looking forward to the wand the most and is dissapointed that it’s already broken.
2.0,Not very durable...
2.0,These shorts dont really replicate the picture. The Jean material looks like 70s material. The waist fit my husband but the crotch area was too short he says.
2.0,THEY DO NOT STAY UP
2.0,SHOE WAS NOT FLEXABLE AT ALL.
2.0,"Buyer beware !! This product is advertised as an Olive & Pique hat, but it's not. Olive and Pique is nowhere on the hat. I have 3 originals and this hat doesn't have the insignia on it. That being said, it's a very decent look alike with great bling and I'll keep it, but just know you're not buying an original. I gave it 2 stars because it arrived one day late and it's not what I thought i was buying."
2.0,Hard as a rock!  Very uncomfortable to carry.
2.0,I ordered 00 and they seem a bit small.
2.0,"I was really dissapointed when I received this item. It looks like a pretty rich brown in the picture, but it’s more of a dark cream color - it looks washed out. 😔 The sleeves are not long enough and around the waist, its baggy and shapeless. The “turtle neck” looks like a stretched out hole"
2.0,Tear on side of boot
2.0,This hat is ok. I looks and feels like $9.99. Not bad
2.0,Too thin and runs large.
2.0,I order these shoes they very cute but run small in size
2.0,"I was hesitant to buy an XL because I'm very busty, so oftentimes need a 2X. The XL was actually a little loose, especially right below the bust. Also, the line below the bust is very high, so unless you have a teeny tiny chest, the line doesn't fall in a flattering spot.<br />Then there's the ""belt"". The picture shows a long bow, which is cute. They must not adjust the length of the belt for different sizes, because tying it in a knot even looks short and awkward.<br />It's a cute and comfy dress, and despite the high under-bust line, it's still pretty flattering."
2.0,"I bought this because it looks long, people said it's long and I wanted long tanks. These will land about at my waistline, not what I wanted at all. I wanted them to go down to my hips or lower. If you have a long torso these will NOT be long on you."
2.0,Starting falling apart day #2
2.0,Disappointed in the color of the beads in general.
2.0,I should have known better by the photo... this hat is not made for women with thick hair
2.0,These pants had an odd fit! They are too big around in the waist- but way too tight in the crotch area!!
2.0,Xl. More like a medium
2.0,"Nice shorts but Way too small.  My daughter wears a small, we ordered a medium and still way too small."
2.0,The material is weird and it is not cut straight. I would have returned it but I cannot find a long sleeve gold shirt for a Gold Out game.
2.0,"It's hard to keep on because it's slick material.  Looks in picture like it has a round top, but it is actually pointed on top and looks funny.  I really wouldn't buy them again."
2.0,"The shirt is comfy, but it starts out small in the shoulders and chest and flows out to a much wider shirt at the bottom. It is not a thin material, so it sticks out on my sides, and makes me look larger than I am. Not flattering at all on my body type."
2.0,One pair broke 30 minutes after I opened it!
2.0,Sorry but look cheap and fit even worse.
2.0,The suit was really small
2.0,chain it was on broke after about 3-4 weeks. the crystal snapped in half last week and I threw the whole thing away. What a waist of money.
2.0,I like the look of it but it’s too big despite measuring and ordering the small size accordingly. It’s too loose to even wear and the return window was short. Super disappointing.
2.0,"Polyester and cotton…not a blend. Polyester on the outside, the inside is cotton with a French terry, not fleece. It’s shiny on the outside and you can see every crease in my bra. So it’s not thick either. And it has pockets although it was advertised to have NONE. I’m a solid medium or small. This is a medium and is a bit snug.  Overall I just don’t like it. I’m not going to contact the seller for a return. Most likely we’d have the language barrier to deal with. Argh. Save your money and buy something different. I’ll send this top to the homeless girls."
2.0,I loved the design when I first got the watch but after wearing it for only a day that watch eye fell off without any propagation. I had to crazy glue the watch eye back onto the watch and this was annoying but it also meant that whatever stains or glue remained on the inside cannot be wiped away. It's just a fairly cheap watch in material (though beautiful when functional) but in this case it'll cost you in the end to have something this low of quality
2.0,The dress fits more like a robe. Not very flattering at all. The only way leg shows is if you physically hold the robe open which is obviously what the girl is doing in the image. If they designed the dress to fit tighter in the waist then allowed the legs to peak through as in the picture i think it would be worth buying.
2.0,The black one broke within a week 😞
2.0,This product was delivered in the above condition  There is no background packaging and the box was too big.  The ad shows the poem on pinkish paper which I choose for a baby girl. The paper was plain white.  Could not and would not give this as a gift.  Very disappointed.
2.0,It’s a gorgeous piece but extremely smaller than expected
2.0,"I was impatient to receive it, but what I got was too tight, returned it as I have received it. Although I have a prime membership, but I had to pay for the return postage, they might reimburse me later for it. The only thing I like about it is the hat band."
2.0,Probably would've been ok if I got it to fit.<br />No stretch whatsoever where our hips and cheeks are.
2.0,The barbell fits as stated in the dimensions but the angel wings are SO tiny that I cannot wear them. I basically just bought barbells. Would not buy this item if I were you.
2.0,"Cheap plastic, heavy and over sized."
2.0,"Not bad for the price, but very very cheaply made. The belt material is subpar, I’ve used it once, but bought 3 new belts since that are amazing."
2.0,My charger came broken...
2.0,"This arrived and it’s a swing and a miss.  The color is dull, it is thick like a sweatshirt and stiff.  Returning it ASAP😞"
2.0,"very low quality. It began falling apart immediately. If more companies sold in this color, I would have bought a higher quality sweatshirt. It served it's purpose briefly but I already need to replace it 2 months later."
2.0,"The chain instantly fell apart. The links aren't even together right. But for $6, I shouldn't be complaining."
2.0,"Not quite what I expected. It’s much cuter in the pic. The bottom of the top has a strange ‘wave’ to it which I don’t care for. The top also runs small. It fits, but it’s way too tight & clingy for me to wear outside of the home. Glad I didn’t pay much for this tank."
2.0,"The dress arrived on time, it looked as the picture; except that the fabric or better say the material of the dress i don't know what's called but is used for crafting. Very weird. Also, it sooooo hard to put on unexplainable eith er. You need a second pair of hands to put on and off .. funny because the dress Fi s as expected. I normally buy a Latg but this time I got an XL it fit well but it was just uncomfortable. Again the dress is not made of fabric but rather a weird thick material. Forgot to take pictures sorry"
2.0,As nice this watch looks. The band breaks so easily. I purchased it 2x. So disappointed. : (
2.0,You better have an incredibly skinny neck. Fell apart after one outing.
2.0,It broke pretty easily. I bought a few things from this seller & most of it had held up nicely. This piece didn't.<br />It looks great though & it's adjustable.
2.0,Smelled like really bad cheap plastic.
2.0,Not as long as the look & they do run small<br />Returned mine for a refund
2.0,These would be great if you wanted them for an added layer of warmth under pants but the weave and fabric are not very attractive with a dress they look and feel really cheap.
2.0,"If I were to buy a dress like this at the store, it would almost always be a size small.  This was incredibly tight, even in a medium. The material is also too thin to use this as a skirt -- it becomes see through and you can see every line.  The feature that makes this dress flexible are two very long straps than can be tied in various ways (that hang off the center of the bust.) Cute concept, but it really doesn't work.  Also, I'd mostly only use this type of dress in a hot climate, and those straps create a lot of extra material hanging off of me, creating bulk.<br /><br />I am giving stars since the fabric is soft and the color is accurate."
2.0,The temple tips were loose upon arrival. The lens was larger than I thought but still looked nice.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this!  And the look of it, I do love.  It's the fit.  It's just weird.  It's SOOO large under the arms, so you HAVE to wear an undershirt and the neck just cuts at a weird spot.  I mean, I wore it under a flannel, so it was fine, but it absolutely runs small.  Like 2 sizes small.  And if you're a larger gal- skip it.  It just fits wrong in all the right places.  Dangit!"
2.0,"They fit really well and are super cute, however they do not handle the washing machine at all. The seams around the neck and arms started coming undone after the first cycle through the washer. I even hung them to dry in hopes that it would help them last longer. No such luck."
2.0,Ok for what I paid
2.0,The pants have cheap and see-through materials. These sheer pants are NOT appropriate for business setting.
2.0,If you are tiny - these are awesome!  Free fit or whatever they call one size fits all is a joke.  I am 125lbs 5'6&#34; and couldn't even pull up the pants.  Silliness.  But if these are ever made in larger sizes - loved them and would buy multiple pairs.
2.0,"Super cute and decently comfy, but i suggest bringing to a shoemaker/repair to have the bow reinforced as they are only glued on."
2.0,"Here's the story on this garment:  See those long, dangling bits in the front?  They serve no purpose.  If you are short  (I am 5' 2&#34;), those things hang almost to the floor, but the back won't cover your behind.  I  don't need to feel wind on my behind.  Anyhow, it might work on a taller person -- except the back would be up to your waist!  Fabric is OK. Kinda thin.  I do love the colors (I got the navy one).  Fit is problematic as is the design.  It just looks so sloppy.  My favorite blankie would look better.  Very disappointed.  NOTE TO PRIME MEMBERS:  This company SHIPPED on the day I should have received the item.  It took SIX DAYS to get to me.  Not impressed. I will return it."
2.0,The item ran extremely small.
2.0,Runs big& just like previous reviews it was an oversized t-shirt with the arms sewn on the inside. Good to wear around the house or maybe as a cover up.
2.0,Ordered a large still was to small.
2.0,"Though I loved the look of the pendant, the chain broke the second time that I wore it."
2.0,I don't like the lint all over my lap or table when I use this polishing cloth.
2.0,Size way up!! I wasted my money on a medium.. currently have a xl on the way hopefully that fits.. would love a refund for the too small shirt
2.0,I only use these for when I travel and the zippers have already broke in them.  I don't over fill them and have only used them about 5 times.  I would probably not replace these when all of them break.
2.0,The backpack was not leakproof. It started leaking the second time I used it.
2.0,I really liked the pattern of this dress and the length of the sleeves. The fabric is not flattering if you have imperfections. Very clingy. It kind of reminds me of a swimsuit material. I’m 5’2 and the length was good. I would have kept it if it was a different fabric.
2.0,The neck hole is super large.  Its almost like a tank top.
2.0,"Honestly, not impressed. They are cute but arrived in cheap plastic wrapping. Slightly higher  quality than that of an egg machine."
2.0,Unfortunately these bras were too itchy for me. They fit really good but I just couldn’t handle the hem rubbing against my skin. Had to return
2.0,The tips of the ear pieces are plastic with a chrome wrap.  I have only had them a few months and the chrome has come off one ear piece.
2.0,Smelled like pants sat in a strong chemical and did not fit
2.0,"This is marketed as a set of 300 silver beads, but I received a set of 100 gold beads. They're decent quality, but not what I ordered."
2.0,Cap came finally but the back strap was not stitched on all the way.
2.0,"Nice color, fabric is on the cheap side, fitting is SO awkard, very unflattering on me, seemed like my torso was too long for it and where it was supposed to be wrapped up.<br />I'm returning it, think works better on shorter girls."
2.0,The color is off and not as pictured.  The sizing is also off.  Looks more like a large/x-large. Buyers beware!
2.0,Wore through much faster than the ones at Walmart
2.0,These earrings were a lot smaller then the picture looked.  Be okay for a child to wear them but too small for me.
2.0,kind of cheap.
2.0,The criss-cross at the shoulders was not well done (like thickly sewed?) so they did not sit on the shoulder in a cute or good way so the whole dress looked awkward - returned
2.0,Uncomfortable!!!
2.0,I wasn't imprssed. Small for a mans watch.
2.0,This looks awful on me. Had to return
2.0,some glue is visible. very pricey for its quality!
2.0,"Smaller than expected. Just fits me, but I am afraid it will bust when I am out on the dance floor."
2.0,I ordered a small and got an XL. The ribbon in the front tore easily after a couple of hours of wearing it. Because it was big I had to pull on it a bit. I didn’t realize it was XL until I washed it.
2.0,This ring looked cheap and gaudy in person.
2.0,Very flimsy material but serves the purpose. We needed them for family Halloween costumes. Ok for the price.
2.0,"Doesn't fit a large get the next size up, but are very soft."
2.0,Great looking watch. No smell. Impossible to remove links without breaking it.
2.0,For cheap they lasted not that long
2.0,"Everything looks red the second you put these on. Which isnt that big of a deal, I just wanted them to be mirrored and not see through"
2.0,"The waistband area doesn’t look like the image. There is too much material that gathers at the waistline which causes the skirt to flair out instead of going down. I also feel the pockets causes that. It does have a lining which is nice but the material isn’t breathable, not good for warm weather. I am returning this."
2.0,metal is not metal - cheap. Returned it.
2.0,"I tried several different brackets on both disposable and cloth masks; none if them prevented fog from forming on my glasses, which is why l bought this in the first place."
2.0,"Poor quality, fabric is too thin. Stitches are weak. The string came fraied with bright colored thread coming out. The hood and the collar are just about the perfect size shape"
2.0,BAD QUALITY
2.0,Well it was really cute but the symbol on the shirt started to come off as soon as I washed it …..
2.0,"The slides are comfy, however for a size 9/10 it fits somewhat small on the back heel for a open toe sandal, I'm usually a size 9. Finally after purchase I realized I could have saved more money buying it directly from VS PINK!"
2.0,"I really like the earrings when I opened the box they came in. The next morning when I was getting ready for work and putting them on, one of the earrings clasp would latch on to the part that holds the clasp. When I Iooked at the earring, it was to wide to for the clasp to even catch. I tried to squeeze the the part closer together so the clasp would reach, the entire earring bent. The pictures shows on the left side how it bent. I wish that the earring was looked at prior to shipping. I did receive complements on the earrings though."
2.0,The chain broke before it was put on.
2.0,It’s nice but material is very thin. I was hoping it would have been more like a traditional Santa hat. Overpriced for what it is.
2.0,The sweatshirt was damaged after one week of use. Don’t buy
2.0,The neck line sags and is wrinkley.
2.0,This is NOT a sweatshirt.  It is a THIN t-shirt.  It has a boxy fit to it.  The cuffs of the sleeve are not fitted as they are on the model.  Fit is true to size.
2.0,Dress is too tight and has a bathing suit material and feel to it. Sending back.
2.0,The bathing suit is cute but hard to put on And the size was too small. The underwear cut into the sides of my bikini. I gave mine to my little cousin. Will not purchase again.
2.0,Size 8 fit more like a size 9 for men. Too long and too wide for my feet.
2.0,It’s too damn long plus the fabric is too flimsy.
2.0,Broke while hanging off my shirt collar on Day-Two.
2.0,"I like the earrings themselves, but they have fallen out 5+ times, and I have finally officially lost them. Very disappointed."
2.0,The quality is poor…for the money!!
2.0,"While it came earlier than expected I'm really unsure of the quality of the metal.  It was definitely not made of steel and the gold plating, whatever it's made of, immediately began flaking off.  It is really pretty but I certainly got what I paid for.  Definitely not for the newly pierced, will irritate the piercing for sure.  Will probably not buy from this seller again."
2.0,The words “UNITED STATES” were blurred. I was disappointed since I was ordering these as a gift for the Marine Corps birthday.
2.0,We’re very small better for small girls not adults.
2.0,"The heel on these shoes are so tight I couldn't even get my foot in, but they are cute boots."
2.0,"Deceptive. Yes, Based on the picture that showed three bags I didn't bother to read the print that told me the package contains 1 VinniBag.  This product is not worth $30.00. My wife rolled 7 bottles of wine in her clothes and got the same results."
2.0,It wasn't a size 10. It felt like a size 8.
2.0,too small and was not satisfied at all.
2.0,"Ok. I think the dress I got was made on a Friday 10 minutes before quitting time by a cross-eyed 5 year old with the attention span of a goldfish using a broken rubber band as measuring device. Shoulda let them play in the bounce house with their friends, not sew your dresses.<br />Every one of the 4 triangular cutout details around the bottom of the waist band are in different, non-equidistant places from each other and are of different widths and lengths in size. If the front center one is at my belly button the rear “center” one is over my right butt cheek, and so on. AND the two breast halter panels are not centered either, nor are they the same width.  It’s impossible to wear straight. I have to strike some weird, contorted magazine pose for it to look ok but only from one side (boob falls out the other). I pulled a muscle trying to take a picture so you’re out of luck. I doubt amazon will pay me the $80 for the massage plus the refund for the dress. 2 stars because the material felt decent and flowed nice. Size is accurate to their guide. Tempted to order another and see if I get lucky."
2.0,It changed color after a week. But there’s a pic before it didn’t.
2.0,I wouldn't know how this product fits because I can't get the correct size in the set. The gray was a size small but the black was a large. I'm not sure is quality control needs to be involved before shipping to customer.
2.0,Not for me. Buttons are not easy to snap on/off with one hand. Ok concept but not a great value and more complicated than it should be.  Overpriced to add. I'm wearing blousy short sleeve button up the front shirts the surgeon recommended. . They are perfect. Just had a shoulder replacement.
2.0,"These are small, which I like.<br />However, they are very difficult to open and close. I broke a nail trying to open the silver one. The black one doesn't even align when in closed position, rendering it pretty much unusable. There must have been some sort of casting error because the little peg that goes into the other side of the ring is deformed. The silver one is okay once I got it in my nose. I will be having to use pliers to remove it."
2.0,"Instead of gathers at waist as pictured, the gathers are just below the bust, giving it the profile of a maternity garment."
2.0,"Well, sometimes I get burned on a deal and this is one of those times. Now, I don't know the brand in total,  but this bra is neither supportive or comfortable.  The material is on the order of a Jane Fonda legging (but baggy) and the front of the straps come up at my neck...no where near resting on the shoulder. I think you got the idea..it's a no go"
2.0,"The fit is decent, but the skirt itself isn't a full circle as it appears. It's a-line. I bought this with the intention of wearing a petticoat with it, but it'll look like crap."
2.0,I would not classify these as bathing suit bottoms. They are unlined with exposed seams that would be very uncomfortable if worn without underwear. These were returned immediately.
2.0,Liked glasses but magnet fell out.i returned product.
2.0,Run super small. But are nice and think
2.0,"When I got it I really liked this belt. Great looking, soft leather and a really cool buckle. Unfortunately the leather started loosing its color almost immediately. Very disappointing. I cannot recommend this belt.<br /><br />Update:<br />After writing this review the vendor immediately offered a full refund or a new belt with upgraded leather strap. Great customer care. Once I receive the new belt I will write another update."
2.0,"Ball screws in the back are an inconvenience and also easy to slip and go missing since they’re slippery in hands when putting on the earrings. Otherwise, earrings are cute, dainty and small."
2.0,Such a shame as it is a pretty dress. I normally wear M-L or 8-10. I read the feedback before buying so I ordered an XL and still too tight in the sleeves. Returned it.
2.0,"Looks nice , to bad the abalone keeps falling out. I would not get this again"
2.0,Larger than expected.  Not as nice as I thought.  Irregular stiching and stiff lining.
2.0,Looks very cheap. Not like pic
2.0,"In contrast to the other masks that I had purchased from the same amazon link (brand EQOBA, 2 Layer Face Madks, Galaxy red and also camouflage masks) These black masks are of a different construction. They do not have the bendable metal nose piece common in other masks and accordingly do not fit as well."
2.0,does not look good - too long.  Had to return it.
2.0,The packet is nice but it dosen't stay on me.
2.0,"It's a very pretty top, however, beware of the &#34;One size fits all&#34; if you're a little busty or have a little bit of a pooch in the stomach.  It will fit too tight.  It would be nice if you could order this blouse in the size that you specifically need and not &#34;one size for all&#34; because everyone clearly aren't ONE size."
2.0,Looked more like stainless steel.
2.0,"Very poor quality. Bought for aqua Zumba and got a bunch of holes in different places in the sock. The bottom of the pool shreads the sock. Very comfortable, but wouldn't use for anything very active."
2.0,"This top is way too long and doesn't have any real form, so I looked like I was wearing a colorful burlap sack. Immediately returned it."
2.0,Although this looks super cute sizing it as a 6 to 12 months is insane! It is more like an 18 month size and the width of the onesie looks like it could fit a 2t!
2.0,This dress was not a true extra large. Maybe it was the cut but it was clearly made for someone with less curves.
2.0,"These are nice looking glasses that fit well and are reasonably high quality. However, I have bought and returned two sets of them because of a design flaw.  One of the lenses appears to be misshapen, causing it to pop out of the frame under very little pressure.  I have had the lens pop out while just sitting in my car, and while just being held normally.  The first time I bought these glasses, I was willing to assume it was a one time defect.  Having received the second pair, I am sure that this is a permanent issue."
2.0,"It is a very boxy fit, too tight across the shoulders and huge everywhere else. Also, the fabric is thin and clings to other fabric in awkward ways. This specific item also came with a hole in it upon arrival. Not satisfied."
2.0,The cup area was too large for the cup we have so it kept moving around. Would not buy again
2.0,"When it came I was happy it is really pretty but I was disappointed in how cheaply the metal was made, there was a sliver off metal hanging off and it cut my belly button whenever it moved."
2.0,The band locks in place from underneath the underside or the band... makes it extremely hard to tighten especially when you need to tighten it past more than a few holes. Other than that its a comfortable material and fits securely (once you get it in place that is)
2.0,"I got it free with another order, so I can't complain about the price. But, if you have to pay for it, don't pay much. I guess it's kind of cute, but wouldn't expect it to last very long."
2.0,Very fragile. Plan to handle with great care.
2.0,Thin and narrow. My daughter isn't chunky and these don't fit her legs well at all.
2.0,The beanie was comfy. But the bluetooth headphones were mediocre. I was to charged it once but that was the only time that it worked.
2.0,No quita el reflejo de los carros. Como dice el anuncio.
2.0,"It is not 20mm, by far it gets to 19mm and the edges ends rolling to the outside"
2.0,"It was missing the belt. Had to return and reorder because they were unable to send the missing belt. That being said, it's very comfortable and fits well."
2.0,Cute design buy very cheaply made. Have to be careful that it doesn't break. So I don't wear as often as I would want to.
2.0,Quality was excellent. Size too small even though usual size was ordered.
2.0,The neck design is OK but the rest is shapeless.  The material looks and feels cheap and is see-through with any color undergarment.
2.0,"Return window closed yesterday. Boo Hiss! I will suck it up & wear them, not every day, to tight & smalla, should have gotten a half size bigger."
2.0,I do not like these. They hurt my toes after wearing them for 3 hours. I thought they would help me because I am on my feet a lot. But they actually feel like they are pinching my toes.
2.0,It made me itch.
2.0,Seem to be very nice.  Sent the wrong color.
2.0,Mask was fine but hat would fit one of my daughters dolls
2.0,"Looks and feels cheap, and is really short."
2.0,This products is made out of simple fabric and is lacking a backing or underside. You will need to wear something underneath this. I love the color (purple). It is not true to the sizing chart (at least one size smaller than advertised).
2.0,The quality is poor and material is weak.
2.0,DOES NOT FIT LIKE A 3X HAD TO GIVE IT TO A FRIEND THAT WEARS A LARGE. THE MATERIAL IS NICE DESIGNED BEAUTIFUL.
2.0,For the price it is okay but you would not want to look at it too closely.
2.0,The necklace is cheap. The pictures make the books look 3D as if u could touch/feel each book. This is not the case. It is just a picture of books with an acrylic type material over it.
2.0,a beautiful shirt but very low cut sewed in a piece of material so it wasn’t cut so low
2.0,"I really wanted to love these… I have a set in sterling silver and they are difficult being so soft and delicate! I was hoping this hinge/metal clasp would make things better.. hoping is key word!!<br /><br />• Metal is dinghy looking, right out of the package! I wish I could attach a photo to explain.. but, there is no bright/new silver look at all!! Instead you get the  “owned these a while and just left them in and forgot about them look.”<br />•I LOVED the idea of this clasp.. sort of flip up and spring/pop back into place. But, it doesn’t function that way… The pair I already own, you must tuck one end inside the other- and it’s not easy.. SSilver can bend when trying to close. Seeing this was a trigger shut- that would pull open, put in ear and it would naturally close, aligning the 2 ends.. NoPe! This too makes you “tuck” in just the very end, which is nice.. Except, this wants to open up on its own- all the time!<br />• Unless, you have skinny/thin or, a “close to the edge” piercing… These struggle to fit around the ear cuff at all! (If that makes sense?!) Not a chance at all of making the smallest fit. The other 2 sizes will just depend on each individual + your piercing placement as well as, thickness of outer ear cuff.<br /><br />• Lastly, keep in mind these are gauged fatter then, a standard earring post! I’ve had ears piercing in ears x30yr. and rarely struggle to fit a post into the hole- With these, I had to force it.. and actually only got it to fit in one side. IF, changing hearing from a stud or if, you uses gauges- this may not be an issue.. but, be aware- these are fatter then, a reg. standard gauged earring post!<br /><br />Sorry to say just “did not likes-“ I realize, these could work/fit for some. Take note: these are standard earring size and will need special caveat to make them work. For that I gave it one star and also, one for the price point.<br />I’m telling you.. Whoever makes a great self closing hoop it step sizes.. that is easy to close and stay that way.. and designed in a standard gauge size.. They will hit the mother load! I found its much harder to locate then, one thinks.. and I’ve tried a handful. For now, I’ll keep looking..<br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!"
2.0,"Bought it for my mother, it  stretched in a different form, and could see through the stitching."
2.0,They look and feel cheaply made. They run large. My left foot was falling over the front of the shoe. Very wide.
2.0,"This dress is very comfortable and has good quality of fabric. It's stretchy and not see through.  For reference,  I'm 5'6, 165lbs, 36D chest and the medium fit great.  However,  I have to return because the color is off.  They used two different black fabrics for the top and bottom part of the dress so it doesn't match and looks different from the online picture. So sadly... I'm going to return.  If you're ok with wearing 2 different shades of black then order this dress."
2.0,Feels like plastic. Bigger than size ordered
2.0,Was not to happy about this purchase. They were not flattering and a little see through.
2.0,I actually like the sunglasses. The main problem is they are too small. Do the come in larger sizes?
2.0,"I was so excited to get these to use on a garter belt. I spent the time sewing the things on, fully expecting them to work properly because they appeared to be sturdy. When I went to use them with my outfit, they wouldn’t even clamp down to stay closed. I am very unsatisfied with this product and I will be returning it."
2.0,It's not a bad shirt. Smaller than expected.  The material isn't the moisture wicking stuff I had hopped for. Feels kind of cheap really. Someone is making a killing selling these.
2.0,This is the cutest  dress. But it was mis-sewn or sewed as well as it was so wrinkled even steam didn’t help. I was afraid to iron it because of the fabric. I sent it back and requested another due to the damaged From the sewing
2.0,"Good concept, just way too small."
2.0,"They are really pretty and look cute on my little girl but after 2 months of using them it suddenly broke, the Hart just felt and the back stay an my 3 yo girl ear, which I find dangerous"
2.0,"When I say this is ugly, I mean it’s UGLY. It looks like a glorified nightgown. Don’t waste your money. Decent quality is the only reason why it got 2 stars"
2.0,"Low quality product, one was broken"
2.0,"All fuzzy after the first 2 wash’s, not really worth it"
2.0,Didn’t like the way it fit. It had a huge flair under the waist line which made it look like a little girl dress. It wasn’t a relaxed cotton either so it looked startched. Not happy with this purchase.
2.0,"Cute and Warm pink. Grey pair same size, style, and brand do not fit. Can't leave the house to return or I would."
2.0,It only get a 2 star because it look just like the picture and is really cool.....the problem is that it's so TINY!!!! I just wanted it as a work watch but it's so small. Looks like something for a child! Definitely not an adult watch. Guess I'll use it as Christmas gifts for my 11 year old cousins.
2.0,"Because this belt is elastic, it stretches way beyond the actual size of the belt.  In order to tighten the belt (so that it holds your pants up), you will be left with many inches of loose belt at the end.  If you are going to order this belt, make sure to order a smaller size than you think you need."
2.0,"Pretty product, but they fit very tightly"
2.0,"Fit is somewhat small.  They are nice and warm and very comfortable, but after only 3 months the sole has come loose and they are falling apart.  Would not buy again."
2.0,This wasn't a bad looking shoe but I should of known for the price that it was not a good quality.  Had to return this item.
2.0,"I normally wear an 8 wide and in Vionic I wear a 7.5 Wide.  In the sneakers and boots I can get away with an 8 wide (I actually own 2 pair of the same Vionic sneaker in both sizes, one to wear with socks and one to wear in summer without so I guess I’m in between the two).  But the sole of my foot is wide, my feet and ankles are not.  The sole fit but like most Vionic wide sandals, the straps were loose.  Normally it’s not a problem but one I tightened the straps on these so they were tight on my foot they looked like goofy old lady sandals with the straps hanging off the side.  It’s a shame, they could be cute.  But I am having to return them.  I will say I got the Vionic hoola sandals in a wide size and while the straps are a bit loose they look fine, stay on my feet and I can make a new ankle strap with a nail if I need to."
2.0,Smaller than normal sizing
2.0,"Both the description and photos indicate that this product comes with TWO clips.  However, the one that shipped to me only has ONE clip.  Although I was sent the incorrect product, it still works okay.  Just doesn't look as cool."
2.0,"I was attracted by the unique of the socks. The color is not as natural as the picture. And they are not soft or elastic at all. My size is six, but they are too big to fit my feet.  I am thing to reture or give them away."
2.0,"Material is nice, length is good, waist is a good width but It's tight around the thighs and the legs are narrow. I tend to like my pajamas baggy, and these are not comfortable to wear."
2.0,the knots are really tiny and not as well defined as in the image.
2.0,"You cannot tell that this is a rose gold ring unless you are looking at your palm face up. I bought both a rose-gold and white-gold of this ring and while the style and diamonds are nice, you honestly can't tell which is which. For almost $200 I would like the rose gold to stand out more because that's the reason I bought the two distinct metals. Can you tell which band is the rose-gold in my set?"
2.0,"Overall a nice dress, but there's an extra back cross strap that makes no sense, so it's not symmetrical. The size chart is wrong or the dress size is wrong. I ordered a L based off the measurements, but it was too big. I tried to order a smaller size on a Saturday, and it was supposed to arrive by Thursday. On Monday I checked the order and it changed from being delivered on Thursday to the following Monday. So I cancelled that order and I had to get the dress tailored. It costed as much to get it tailored than the dress costed itself. NOT WORTH IT."
2.0,Long time to ship from china for an adaquet item
2.0,"Teeny tiny and tight! Not suited at all for 'plus size' (XL/16). I can usually order XL in T Shirt dresses and they fit just fine. This dress would be adorable on a smaller frame (like size 10 or 12 maybe and below).<br /><br />Would have loved to keep this but because it was skin tight, I will be returning."
2.0,"This would be really cute, but is really uncomfortable.  Anytime most people want to wear a top like this that is sleeveless, it is usually hot weather.  The neckline is much higher than it appears in the photo; almost a mock turtleneck but not quite.  Much too warm for hot weather wear!  The fabric also felt very scratchy and I could not imagine wearing it all day.  I returned it."
2.0,"I liked it was inexpensive,  I like the color, and its easy to read, but the watch was very small, and product is made of low quality. I purchased it for work, and its not worthy."
2.0,"Pretty dress, but way too big and too long. I am 5' 2&#34; and 107 lbs. The smallest size was a small and it was very large and hung down to my knees in the front which is shorter than the back."
2.0,Although the dress is nice it looks nothing like the picture it is very deceiving!! Disappointed about that
2.0,Watch is much smaller than I expected. The night light on the watch is ineffective.
2.0,"I have a size 12 shoe, so one would think these would be a fairly snug fit. Quite the opposite, the foot size is even larger than previous socks. So if your foot is smaller, you may find them really loose. They also don't feel as soft as older versions. Probably because they now have less cotton and more polyester, rubber, etc. Even though I will still wear them, this will be the last time I purchase Hanes."
2.0,"The neckline is way higher than pictured, the  dress is a hot, thick material, and it was way too big on me despite following reviews and size charts.  It was long enough and did have pockets though. The dress was very costumey so I can't wear it to work as I had intended."
2.0,Not as expected. Looks like picture. Unfortunately it was too long for me so this kinda messes up the look for me. But most importantly I though the leggings were all in one piece. But they are made with one big piece of sheer fabric and the black solid fabric crosses over the sheer one and tou can put your hands in between the fabric. So things can get hooked on it easily and that lowers the life expectation of your legging in my opinion.<br /><br />But it is very sexy looking. And just for the looks I am debating if I should keep them...
2.0,"The sleeves don’t roll up well so you won’t see the dark white stripes. It’s basically your regular grey dress shirt. The material was okay, didn’t like or dislike it."
2.0,It’s cool looking but mine didn’t come with a stand and the pen doesn’t work.
2.0,"This bag pack is exactly the size I needed. I loved how many pockets this bag has, especially the hidden one in the back. The color options are also incredible! I gave this bag a low rating due to durability. I carry no more than three pounds and the straps broke. I use this bag every day, it replaces a purse for me and in under a year it was broken, (used from September-April). I had to order another bag and took a chance with another brand."
2.0,"Low quality bearings, nice style but not suitable for hard skating girls."
2.0,"Not durable, frayed at buckle holes within days"
2.0,Colors ran all over dress with first washing
2.0,I recived my pants and they are great material.  The pants size for waist was tighter than said.  I ordered 34. But in these pants I’m a 38.  Then I wore these pants for 2 hours and the crotch button popped off and it wasn’t even the right spot.  I was shocked this happened.  I recommend this product but be reminded that you should get 2 sizes bigger than your real waist size and be aware of fly buttons.  Jk. Otherwise great pants
2.0,"If these cost $35 I'd be all for them. At $85, they're overpriced. The sole has a logo on it that reads 'WORK BOOT' and the printing is off.<br />The leather was thick, I must admit. There was what looked like a goodyear welt, but everything was plastic or junky feeling rubber other than the upper. Really tall, too. I could have fit 1 1/2 of my feet in there.<br />They look good in the pic, definitely. But if you were in a store and picked these up you'd probably not buy them. I cant comment on durability as I returned them shortly after opening the box. Maybe they're better than they look, but I didnt take the risk."
2.0,Cute but super big in waist. Picture inaccurately depicts the silhouette of the dress.
2.0,"The product came completely hardened in the jar. I had to use the end of a comb to break the product up in order to get any product out. I loved the results after spending over 5 mins. breaking out the product for usage; but, it’s a pain! I want to be able to just scoop it out like other scrubs. It seemed like the oil may have leaked out during shipping as the wrapping was covered in oil when I pulled the product out of the packaging."
2.0,Niether
2.0,These run real small. I ordered the size for 3-4 year old and it came looking like it would fit an infant around 12 months
2.0,"Not the best quality, no stretch in the band portion (bottom ) (too tight)  Wasn't happy, I sent it back."
2.0,It have a big HORRIBLE print on the back between shoulder which is NOT CUTE and doesn't justify for the price i paid for that UGLY shiny publicity print on my back
2.0,I like the material and how it feels however this is definitely not a compression shirt at all.
2.0,Love the fit and comfort! However one time in the washing machine and th lace had BIG holes in them 😭
2.0,it falls off easily of my glasses
2.0,These are a little large for my three-year-old and are very thin. Poor quality. I don’t expect them to last more than a month or two. I bought them because it is so hard to find a pack of all white socks for toddlers and we try to do a single color so that they are easy to match. I won’t be repurchasing these
2.0,Nice set of pajamas except for one pair of pants. The seam on one of the legs came undone after one wash. There is a big hole as seen in the picture. I’m planning on returning them and hopefully get a replacement.
2.0,"No remotely pink.  Beige, maybe.  YUCK"
2.0,"I'm a big guy and I need to put some pressure on a belt.  The first time I put this on the buckle spread apart and the roller fell to the floor.  I bought it to make airports easier, but while removable, this buckle is worthless.  Fortunately I have other buckles."
2.0,so small i couldn't wear it...it is very cute though.
2.0,"Completely see through! The material is very thin and if you have any sort of hip, this dress is not flattering at all. I returned it as soon as I got it."
2.0,So pretty when they first came in.  Have discolored a little too quickly. Disappointed in the quality.
2.0,"Shrink after the first wash, runs very small"
2.0,Very thin not cute
2.0,"This product is exactly how it looks in the picture, and they give you the right amount, but the bracelets fall apart after a few days of wearing them. The metal beads do not stay on, and the knots unravel, causing the bracelets to fall off the wrist."
2.0,I don’t know if I got an allergic reaction but these gloves are not for me and the touchscreen feature doesn’t work properly
2.0,"Super thin, not very flattering"
2.0,camel toe galore! (never had this happen lmao)
2.0,broke after 2 days of use.
2.0,"I love how they look and how they feel on the foot. But I cannot wear them! They are so stinky- smell heavy chemicals, I get headache from the smell. How the leather can be so smelly of chemicals?"
2.0,I have been having a few leaks
2.0,"If you have long hair, it’s too small to be noticeable"
2.0,"One of the little beads was snapped in half, although the item was damaged I will fix on my own as I know my daughter will love this as a stocking stuffer on Christmas morning."
2.0,"The gloves are super soft, but smell horrible out of the package. Had to leave them outside a few days to get the smell to be manageable. They work fine on touchscreens so far. As far as durability goes, the material is very thin and seems like it will tear very easily."
2.0,The color was wrong I thought it was orange
2.0,Sooo disappointed.<br />I've been looking for a Japanese school uniform for so long.<br />i was so happy when this arrived but i couldn't even get my arms in the sleeves when i tried it on.<br />I got a size bigger just as many reviewers suggested.<br />but it was still way small and i'm sad now.<br />the material is ok and feels nice which is why i'm giving it 2 stars.<br />but i just couldn't try it on. i ordered a XL.
2.0,"I bought the largest size available (it says on the tag that it is a US size XL) but it wouldn't even be a medium. i tried to put it on and the zipper split, also. i usually fit in a us size L so i thought buying 2 sizes up would be safe. It wasn't."
2.0,Studs love them! Hoops do not latch correctly.
2.0,This product runs small; I will have to return.
2.0,Bought it for the wife for Christmas. Its July and she still hasnt worn it since trying it on Christmas night.
2.0,I’m still trying to figure out how to run this
2.0,Heavy rope chain and note is way too big and gawdy
2.0,My daughter loved it and wore it about 4 times and the chain broke
2.0,Fit is slightly snug. The elastic waistband comes apart from the fabric and is not sewn to the fabric well.
2.0,What I dislike about this product is I couldn't put my ponytail in it you need to make a bigger hole in the back and it should be for any height ponytails
2.0,"this necklace came in with pretty beading on an ugly blue string which does not match the pretty black, and crystal beads...  I will have to restring it."
2.0,These pants are colorful but ratehr see through - espcially in the buttocks area.  Obviusly this is not the area where you would want litter/thinner material.
2.0,Too small. It fit my 12 year old daughter like it fits the mannequin. I'll be returning this.
2.0,It’s really cheap.
2.0,Not true to size came in smaller but good quality..
2.0,"Very cheap material and not at all flattering for all body types. I'm 5'2, 140 lbs, wear a size 36 D bra and I looked like I was wearing a table cloth. May look nice on tall, slender frames though."
2.0,These pants are gorgeous. The reason why i gave 2 stars its because they are extremely see through. You have to wear shorts underneath or else you'll show all the goods.. Happy buying
2.0,"These are comfortable, I'll say that.  However, mine have neither the pleats or the fabric enough to drape as shown, even ordering up 2 sizes."
2.0,Cute dress but way too small.  Need to size up if you’re curvy in the hips/bottom.
2.0,"This fabric and style was nice as was the color but it was too short for my torso and the pleats made my flat belly look like I had a pooch. I'm 5'6, 150 lbs and ordered a medium. Large would be too big."
2.0,This is not cute. It looks cute on the model in the picture. But when I got it and tried it on my son asked me if I was an elf and my husband’s reaction was “Where’s Waldo?” The fit was loose but the sleeves were kind of short. I’m returning it.
2.0,"I was looking for a nice floral skirt for a white top when I came across this. I ordered it and it came quickly. The fit was nice and the length perfect but my daughter didn't like the shine so I returned it. It was a very shiny material, looked kinda cheapy. Pity cuz the fit was pretty nice."
2.0,"They're much bigger than anticipated, and was honestly hoping they would be smaller to put on a shirt collar like some of the characters do in the show. Also, when i recieved them the enamel may have melted and spread across the rest of the pin. I cleaned it up with isopropyl alcohol, but one was worse than the other and didnt clean up as nicely. They're ok enough and not worth a return, but I do wish they were smaller and less messy."
2.0,Quality differs
2.0,"I had the first generation of this wallet about 5 years, it was fantastic on every level. They changed it to have this stupid sticker on the rubber holding the two sides together and simply put it was a terrible change, the sticker was pealing off quickly and where the sticker was, the rubber was thinner that the original wallet and thus weaker and lasted less than a year. quite disappointed, and now have to find a new wallet I liked as much as the original, do NOT purchase this wallet you will be sadly disappointed in short time."
2.0,Runs a tad small.  I am actually okay with it being a tad tight. My issue was the ruffles. It doesn’t “ruffle” it just looks like to flat pieces of material added at the bottom.  Which makes it look a little more like for a more mature lady.  Lol.  Definitely doesn’t look like the picture.
2.0,This product runs extremely small.  The top is a joke.  The lady in the picture has large boobs and it is obviously photo shopped. There is no room for breasts. The top is a string.  The measurements are off because I measured before purchasing.  Not happy with this purchase.  I don't even know who I could give it away too.<br /><br />I was given a discount for my honest review.
2.0,Not what I wanted but not sending it back shipping is not worth it.  I do not like the material either. Oh well another bad buy on the internet.
2.0,The magnets came lose and I had to pop them back in anytime I took my watch off. After about a month the metal started to unravel and it snagged my shirts and made runs.
2.0,I liked the look... however you could see where a break in the chain was BADLY repaired and it turned my neck green after I wore it the first day.
2.0,I was going to wear it for a Victorian walk on Dec 3 but didn’t get it in time! Would like to return!
2.0,"Very poor quality, very poorly sewn... Save yourself the trouble and not buy this garbage... I think I've wore it five times over the past month and it's falling apart..."
2.0,Way to big... not impressed with material
2.0,"I wanted to like these, I really did. I wear an XL in every other brand of underwear I've tried. These I need at least a 2XL if not a 3XL. The fabric feels really great to the touch, but it has no stretch at all. If one has an XL waist, it's not unreasonable to assume one might have XL legs, too. This underwear didn't make that assumption. Instead, the leg holes are far too small and you end up having to force the legs up your thighs in order to get the waistband to your waist. Then the legs are tight, the waistband is pulled south, and the crotch is a bit too short to accommodate much of anything. Until they rethink and redesign, I wouldn't get these again."
2.0,"Lenses are FAR too dark.  They float which is awesome.  And they look different.  They're comfy, too, as the hinges are springy and expand outward as needed.  But the fact that everything looks dark through these completely ruins it.  My friends that have worn them say the same thing.  Compared to any decently priced sunglasses ($50+), the difference is (almost literally) night & day.<br /><br />If they start making these with higher quality lenses, I'd wear them all the time!<br /><br />By the way, I bought these directly from Swell, not Amazon.  The shipping was nice and the case is very high quality."
2.0,Looks great on the model in the photos but is like a thick unattractive crew neck t-shirt in reality. The quality looks good. Had to return.
2.0,Not as thick as I would think
2.0,"I do not know why but it did not felt like a stone to me, it is felt lite to me.  It felt like a plastic, I am sorry but I cannot recommend something that I do not feel is what it is."
2.0,Seems like when dealing with China and clothes you'd better jump up a size or two.
2.0,Adorable yet way too small. I like small purses but this went beyond small. Tiny.
2.0,The front rode up too high and the dress was mostly see-through...disappointing!
2.0,Beautiful purse but has a bad smell inside and the outside pocket tore after one week of purchase.
2.0,The plastic is too hard and inflexible for this bag to be of any use to me. I have to fight it to get the pockets open. Its really ridiculous
2.0,Ordered the right size but it's still too small.
2.0,Fabric is not as described. Very stiff. Shape is incorrect and sizing is off.
2.0,Jeweler had to install. Now the gold plating is rubbing off!
2.0,"I’m a plumber/pipe-fitter and I forget to put the water lock on my watch while working and I was hoping this would work so I wouldn’t have to remember. Following the direction’s I made sure there were no gaps around the rear seal. After a few hours of wet work the front plastic is foggy, opening it up there’s water inside.<br />I let it dry out over night and gave it a second try and same thing within a half an hour. More water inside and the front is foggy.<br />It say’s waterproof but I beg to differ."
2.0,The leg holes of this product is very large and my poor son hated them. He told me his junk hung out.  Lol not the conversation I was expecting.  We only opened two of the packages and we gave the rest away.  I had to go buy new underwear for him.
2.0,"Ive had these grey shoes a week and they're already meh. The stamps inside have constantly left in marks on my son's heel and top of his foot. The soles of the shoes have worn the color away from wear already. It's been 7days. We've had BirdRockBaby, which my son wore nonstop for 6+ months and they still look as good a the day we bought them. Considering these FP shoes are $20+ more than the BRB alternative, they aren't worth it. I'll probably end up buying another pair of BRB shoes."
2.0,"I like how long the skirt is, but the body suit part underneath just doesn't fit my shape. I've decided I have too much belly for a one piece. Basically the panty part doesn't sit flat on the skin because it's being pushed out by belly and being pulled up by the shoulder straps. I think it would be great for a plus sized person whose body is a little more proportionate."
2.0,"Like other reviewers noted after we used this the first time the zipper broke. We took a chance and hoped they had fixed the problem, but they haven't. Lucky for us we were with someone that could fix it."
2.0,"It seems like it is the watch I wanted and not some fake nock off, but at first I was concerned.<br />The watch which I had intended to be a gift came in a plastic bag not a decent looking, presentable box. So I'm forced to return it and look for something else.<br /><br />Not a bad watch.. just shocked at the lame packaging."
2.0,"No me gusto nada que ver con la foto ,la tela de muy mala calidad ,además muy malo las costura"
2.0,Cheaply made and color is way off from photo.
2.0,"Although these are cute, they are to big and fall off my 5month old. I have to return them, I would recommend them for a 10month old maybe they would fit better. Ok quality, spend your money on sandals instead."
2.0,"Cute, but sizes are way off. I bought an extra large, but this fit my best friend who’s a solid medium like a second skin."
2.0,"It's a great product but I want to wear it to work. I can't adjust it to length, so I only leaves it in my car. Too long around my neck"
2.0,"I really did like this bracelet at first , it was shiny and could withstand water and sun exposure without losing its color. However just a month after the clasp broke. I tried to fix it however it broke again. It kept breaking that the bracelet is now too small to wear because chunks were coming off of it. If it wasn't THAT fragile i would've given it 5 stars but i really didn't get to enjoy it more than a month. Disappointing !"
2.0,"To begin with, I have small hips, but this dress made me look like I had giant hips. And it was too long on my 5 foot six frame."
2.0,Uncomfortable in the back area.
2.0,"It's pretty, but one ""strand"" had a broken elastic thread and I had to repair before I could wear!"
2.0,"La camiseta tiene un material normal de algodón, pero el logo es de muy mala calidad, no se ve bien. Yo regresé el producto por que no es como se ve en la foto."
2.0,"It says 80% cotton. I think it's much less, there's no give. It is cute and soft, but runs at least 2 sizes too small. I ordered a 2x because I expected it to be small and I don't like things to be tight, so I tried to allow for that. If you normally wear a large, or probably even an extra large, or have a larger chest,, a 2x won't fit. At least not comfortably. Giving mine to a friend."
2.0,Very thin cotton. Feels super soft. Like underwear. Scared they won’t last after a wash or two. Truly too thin material for me to feel they’re worth it.
2.0,Cute but runs small. I ordered a size up from my normal size and couldn't even get them over my hips. Had to return
2.0,Both keys were cut at HOME DEPOT but neither worked.
2.0,Opened package and found that zipper was broken.  Tried on anyway to see if I wanted to order it again.  Wasn't crazy about the material.  Will return.
2.0,Difficult to assemble
2.0,"Beautiful-I thought. Once I got them, the pattern is still beautiful; however the fitting is incorrect in my opinion. The waistband doesn't fit well, which makes the pants slip down continuously."
2.0,Too big... I'm 5'2 105 pounds and I got the extra small and it was too big I will have to shrink it.
2.0,"Vans are great, hands down, but these did not look &#34;overwashed.&#34; They just look white plus several studs fell out the first week"
2.0,"I'm 5'5"" 130 pounds and I purchased this dress in a small.  It was a little short (but would have worked) and otherwise fit great.  It actually was very flattering.  But the dots... they ruined this dress!!!! They reminded me of shag carpet.  They were rough and ragged and made the dress look cheap.  Bummer! I sent it back."
2.0,We received it and when we took it out of package it was coming apart.  The strings that hold the feathers had not been tied or come undone.  You couldn’t tie it because the string was too short but I temporarily fixed it.
2.0,"I have thick thighs, not that much though... and they were so tight it looked like it was squeezing my thighs."
2.0,Turned finger green in less than 24 hours
2.0,"Cheaply made, pockets are now very well sewed."
2.0,these were way too tall for my leg....cant even wear them
2.0,Smaller size than Visual pic
2.0,"The glasses were well made and polaroid -- but while most reviews were great -- I did not notice any improvement in night vision,  and quite frankly, got more glare with them than without them.  Maybe just me due to cataract surgery?"
2.0,It’s okay but doesn’t look like the picture.
2.0,The nigth ligth doesn't work
2.0,looked like it was worn didn't look like picture in terms of the gold.
2.0,"Small one size does not fit all, very light weight and not warm but for kids or small women might be nice"
2.0,got it fallen apart
2.0,"Love the idea of the trident, love the aesthetic, the Trident head stripped after the first time I took it off to clean it! Made me so sad."
2.0,"A good novelty idea; poorly executed.  The sample flashlight gloves received to review looked like it was already used.  The black plastic dome on each of the gloves were all scratched and there were a few loose threads hanging from various parts of the glove, giving an appearance of poor finish and/or used item (the product gives an air of cheaply made product).  The package exterior box calls for activation of Glovelite, but that was not necessary because someone already removed the plastic battery tab.  Each pair of gloves require 2xCR2016 or 1xCR2032 battery(ies), and these glove flashlights are NOT rechargeable as it was advertised on the Amazon site.  I also noticed inconsistent stitching and misaligned fitment on the product.<br /><br />The glove flashlight, however, does work and functions as intended.  The lights on the thumb and index finger shine an appropriate amount light to get things done in the dark areas where flashlights do not work properly.  The glove fits my medium sized hand snuggly and the Velcro strap helps secure the glove.<br /><br />Overall a great concept, but the quality, the fitment, and the finish were less than adequate.  Plus the claim that this is a “Rechargeable LED Flashlight Gloves” is not accurate  I would be a bit disappointed if I had to purchase the product given the pricing point to the quality."
2.0,"Like the product when it works, but a thirty day return policy stinks. I just want this again, but not manufactured incorrectly. Bought it in January. It’s now March and broken. I work indoors, and do not wear it outside much (live in Florida - tan lines get bad quickly!).<br /><br />Seller - could you help me?"
2.0,I bought 2 in blue and 2 in black in size medium. The black were more like a size small and the blue were a size XL. All four shirts were fraying at the seams.
2.0,"Product not true to size. Not what I expected, I reordered an XS it feels like a medium or large, I tried it on and it kept falling. I'm returning the item."
2.0,I was disappointed..This item does not have any pink in it it s off white/ beige.It also looks cheap. I plan to return
2.0,Returned it because I was afraid it would rip apart after some use.
2.0,I don't like it. It's a lot larger and it's flat and hollow. Not really what I was expecting
2.0,"Disappointing!  After receiving the watch, reading the manual, and setting the city and Day Light Savings Time.  The auto setting for Day Light Savings time did not work.  The watch also was turned toward the west sun for 4 to 5 hours for two straight days, yet it never left M (medium power setting) designation for the solar battery.  It should have moved by the end of the first day to H for high battery power.  I returned the watch to Amazon, and received a full refunded of the purchase price."
2.0,"Too small, Sizing was off, had to return. Fabric also not very flexible, not good choice for Pajamas"
2.0,This dress was unflattering.  I give her huge shout to the makers of this dress.  To stitch something so neatly on the cheap material show skills.
2.0,"this is the second pair of blue glasses that I've purchased and the paint peels off.  I've had the gray and black without issues, but the blue seems to be inferior paint and quality."
2.0,"too flimsy, and it does not fit very good."
2.0,Some are not flush on your ears when put on.
2.0,Color does not match with what I received
2.0,the alarm is always on l can't seem to get it to shut up for long
2.0,It's nice but very cheaply made it has tshirt material on top on piece of cotton I could have made it at home
2.0,"They run too BIG, I got frustrated after 2nd  order and just gave up so I DON'T even own a pair. DISAPPOINTED  for sure."
2.0,Very pretty but the centers are fragile.  One center came off and needed to be glued back on.
2.0,"It is a cute mask. Bought because of the adjustable ear pieces...the plastic piece you slide to adjust...broke quickly. Now strings are too long. Tried to tie them to correct size for the child...not work well. Will have to cut strings off, replace with elastic I guess."
2.0,"I wore these about 4 times, and the entire heel of one boot is completely falling off.  I even keep them in the original box, on a shelf.  It's not like I have beat them up, or not taken care of them.  Super disappointed with the quality.  Too late to return them."
2.0,This is cute shirt but runs small. Ordered XL but fit like a large.
2.0,"This was the CUTEST dress based on the photo.  It was super cute in person, but the size chart was highly inaccurate.  I would assume that the size chart refers to body measurements, which would be smaller than the actual garment measurement if you want to breathe.  I got the 2X, which said that it was for a bust measurement of 43 and a waist measurement of 36.  It did not anywhere NEAR fit, so I measured the actual garment, which has only a very little stretch.  The garment bust was 40.5 inches at its widest point under the arms.  The waist was exactly 36 inches.  I am disappointed that the size chart was so far off, since the print fabrics are the cutest I have seen."
2.0,The buttons fell off within a 2 day period.
2.0,"I bought this dress one size up like the other Homyee dresses but it was way too small. A size 14 fit my friend who is a size 6! It's pretty, just not sized right."
2.0,I WAS VERY HOPEFUL THESE WOULD BE COMFORTABLE....THE LEGGINGS  ARE VERY SMOOTH BUT THEY WON'T STAY UP ON ME....I'M NOT A SMALL WOMAN....I WEAR A 16W USUALLY SO I THOUGHT THESE WOULD FIT....THE WAISTBAND IS VERY LOOSE AND THEY SLIP DOWN IN THE BACK AND IN THE CROTCH....THEY DROVE ME CRAZY WHEN I WORE THEM.....SPENT THE NIGHT LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO PULL THEM  BACK UP.....MAYBE I COULD USE SUSPENDERS WITH THEM...I WOULDN'T BUY THEM AGAIN ....  :(
2.0,Tarnished quickly and no good quality silver.
2.0,Love the frame and lenses but the problem is that they are too small. Doesn’t look or feel right.
2.0,It broke after a being worn only a few times. Not durable at all. Cheap made.
2.0,First time wearing them and the sock got a hole in it near the ankle
2.0,Bigger than expected<br />A little gaudy
2.0,Loved the ring but the stone fell out after a month.
2.0,Very poor quality.  I will be returning it.
2.0,"I'm a 36D with a flabby tummy.  I've done a lot of Amazon shopping an have learned a 40"" bust is usually on the comfortably loose side.<br /><br />So, I ordered up based on the size chart. An XL should have a 40.2 inch bust.  Here you can see I measured at the widest part... Not even close.  That about 4 inches off. That's significant.  So, even sizing up, it's too small.<br /><br />Other than that, it seems like a decent shirt. I pulled it out of the package and didn't even think I'd get this shirt on. But it has a nice stretch and is soft. The print is clear.<br /><br />But, due to the inaccurate sizing,it's unwearable."
2.0,Cheap hat material and the vinyl ooks cheap. Looks like a cheaply made hat.
2.0,I wouldn’t recommend this robe. It was totally wrinkled upon arrival which; even after washing and drying per instructions it still looks horrible!! Definitely made a mistake with this purchase…
2.0,"Ordered a white with black stripes.  It’s more of a cream, not white and the bottom section the stripes Don’t line up at the seam.  Would be super cute if it really did look like shown where they line up and show on a slight angle.  This was not the case."
2.0,"I'm returning these - they run so small, maybe by 3-4 sizes."
2.0,Mask is great. One side is already breaking/fraying after only 3 uses.
2.0,very cheap looks like its for  little girls not grown ppl
2.0,The fit wasnt a problem so much as the fact that the top was COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH! could have been a cute dress as long as you dont mind your nipples being part of the look. Nit supplying pictures of obvious reasons.
2.0,Wasn’t a big fan of the costume. The quality wasn’t  great. I guess it’s with the price you’re paying for it
2.0,Back of buckle digs into body.
2.0,"This is a decent watch band, and if you press really hard you can engage the Apple Pay button, but double pressing it is too hard, so I end up using my phone."
2.0,It looked really nice. But i ordered a 4x and got a medium dress...Not true to the size chart.
2.0,Product was a little small and tends to not stay in place while dancing
2.0,It's like Daiso quality.
2.0,Loved it until the zipper jammed.  eBags ignored my warranty request even though it was still under warranty.  :(
2.0,They don’t have the best fit/feel
2.0,"I was satisfied with the boots, but that changed today when the bottom began coming off. Only 2 months."
2.0,It looks nice but runs very small. An 8-10 size could fit a 5 year old.
2.0,looks hella fake
2.0,Wore out quickly. Used at a neighborhood pool and holes developed at the seams within the month.
2.0,The emoji faces fall off the earring very easy. My daughter loves them but they aren't very high quality.
2.0,Dress was ok but way to big! I ordered a size 12 and it was a monster...
2.0,The embroidery is of poor quality. Stitches are missed. Very cheaply made. Floral part is decent. Will not last long.
2.0,I bought a 3xl and it fits about 1 size too small.
2.0,"I bought this dress for work. It was not as expected, the material is not good quality. It is also too large on me so it just hangs. It is a very beautiful dress though I wish I would've got the lg instead of the xl."
2.0,More of a costume type skirt. Too large and having to return it. It's very long and puffy...and I'm 5' 7''.
2.0,"This jacket is made out of a great material but I typically wear a size XS or S (normally shop at the loft, limited, ny&c for reference) and I ordered a medium thinking it would be a bit roomier to wear sweaters underneath. But it barely buttons."
2.0,Not sure how these are all a size Small ?! Too bad because other than that the quality is great
2.0,The fact that he first time I used it the pin broke. I am very disappointed
2.0,Ordered the largest size. Did not even cover my chest it was so short. Very pretty print. Would fit a child
2.0,Ordered these and then it took a few weeks to deliver so it was almost a surprise when they finally arrived.  Put these on and wow are they short on me!  More like short boxers.  Husband loves them but I can’t wear them outside the house or if the kids are home.
2.0,"I have a very wide head.  The top outside corner of the lens digs into my head.  For reference, I wear 54x18 eye glasses."
2.0,The legs are way too tight if you go by the chart. The waist fits... but that's all. These look like they may fit a ten year old. I didn't know I ordered polyester . These are not for me
2.0,"The pattern is GORGEOUS in person. Unfortunately it is not at all flow-y like a kimono should be. I usually wear a M or L and have broad shoulders and this was tight on the arms, across the back and the sleeve length was really short. It’s only a “One size” so I can size up...so sad!!"
2.0,"Product was advertised as 95% cotton and 5% polyester, but when it arrived the tag said (and fabric felt like) the opposite. Returned item and was refunded quite quickly."
2.0,The color of the bag is not what is in the picture it is a lime green not light Green
2.0,"They are beautiful and you do get a pair. The stem is short to fit in my upper ear. The ball that is the backing is tiny and screws on. Its difficult to do. A little big for the upper ear, hurts. If I do wear again I will probably wear them on lower part of ear."
2.0,"Dress looked and fit nice. However, the zipper broke the almost immediately."
2.0,"Sneakers are very comfortable but I ordered on size 9.5 and received on size 10. It also looks that they are failed, there are holes in the upper. Im really not happy and I’m disappointed with this purchase"
2.0,a little too large for my face
2.0,Very soft. Returned it. I ordered an L and it fit like a 3X. Also the striped color was Inverted. Then I ordered a M and it fit like a 3X also.
2.0,"I think we all appreciate a decent deal, and that's what made me purchase. I'm disappointed that this purchase is UNUSABLE to me.<br />Unfortunately, the description is NOT CLEAR concerning wearability. For a standard lobe-pierced ear like mine, there was was much discomfort - and a little blood - just to get the post inserted. I could not get the hoop inserted at all; the curvature of its post and the lack thereof in my piercing was simply too painful when attempting insertion. It seems the seller is not up to speed re: gauge sizes. Product is listed as 18g - ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. Again, I CAN'T INSERT THESE AT ALL WITHOUT PAIN OR BLOOD. According to at least 3 charts I've perused, a more accurate measure of these posts are between 10g & 14g, depending on the chart."
2.0,"Too sheer, doesn’t look like picture, and itchy"
2.0,"Only buy this if u want something for a costume , it would do nothing for you outside of maybe Halloween. It looks fairly..... flimsy and cheap so if ur considering this for a &#34;sexy&#34; surprise , I would say.. don't do it sis."
2.0,it's not true to size
2.0,Horrible Fit
2.0,Not the best quality.  See through
2.0,"Item runs large, not sure why I listened to other reviews! Buy your size or size down."
2.0,They were too tiny for me. These are probably better for a woman or young girl/boy.
2.0,"No tags in dress, so not sure on the size. It was to small. Couldn't wear it. Returning it. Very inconvenient."
2.0,I have worn this particular style of pants for years now.  I love them  and thought I was replacing a well-worn out pair with a new pair of regular length ones.  But what I received were the SHORT style.  BEWARE the description does not specify pant length and I assumed that they were Regular length and was wrong.  They are going back....
2.0,Was to small tee
2.0,"Ordered a small, but feels like an extra small. I 'll wear it but have to stretch it out"
2.0,I received it with Macy's invoice in it and opened the box.
2.0,"they look cute but the sides do not come sewn,"
2.0,"This is as great package for kids wrists.  But, the charms are entirely too small."
2.0,"I really love the top of these pajamas. The bottoms fit wonderful in the butt area, the length of the legs is my issue....I would have to be 10 foot tall for them to hopefully fit me...but the material is amazing. It's nothing that a pair of scissors can't fix."
2.0,Wore and washed once.  Looked faded and worn after only one wash.  Disappointed.
2.0,"My kit came with a missing size, too, as I see others are saying. I had 2 of the 14g and 0 of the 12g.  Way too big of a jump from 14g to 10g. I didn't realize until I was sizing up so it was too late to return. I had to purchase additional 12g elsewhere. Also, it would be nice if the bags were marked. Maybe it would help prevent missing sizes when the orders are shipped out. Other than this issue, the product is of good quality, so it's a shame I can't give it 5 stars, when I would have liked to for quality!"
2.0,"Shirt design very nice, love the style, but the size is way off."
2.0,"This fit just as expected measurement wise. I cannot wear this with the insert because it has been warped, I guess by the way it was folded or stored before getting here. These inserts are easily pulled out with the premade hole on both sides. Sad that I can’t use it because it provides no nip barrier without the inserts. If I leave the inserts in it looks like I have a deformed nip."
2.0,Shrank to half he size after one wash. Not much stretch at seams.
2.0,The gem to peep into to see your photo is almost near impossible to look into<br />Also the Chain is thin and frail
2.0,A bit disappointed...they are pretty but not pink like shown in picture...more of a creamy off-white. I really wanted the lovely pink tinge.
2.0,The picture is much cuter than the reality of these shoes. The fabric is cheap and doesn't stand up well on the boot. Very wrinkled and also on the smaller side.<br />Overall wouldn't recommend.
2.0,Looks cool but the clasp part is very weak and hangs open like picture.
2.0,"I have ordered this same dress in charcoal grey several times over the past year or so.  It does tend to lose shape after several washings which is why the need for reordering.  Recently when I ordered it, the color was different (a much lighter grey) as well as the material and sizing (ran smaller), yet it was labeled as being the same exact style/color dress that I ordered in the past.  I thought it was a mistake so sent it back for a replacement and the same type of dress was sent again.  Contacted company to inform them and they said they were going to investigate.  I wear this dress as a uniform, so really hoped to receive the correct style/color dress but as of yet I have not been able to do so.  Have also not received a refund as of yet."
2.0,"Fit not quite snug enough in torso. Zipper broke after a month, rendering it useless."
2.0,"I was given a pair of these at a radiology facility around 10 years ago, when I had some diagnostic imaging done. They were huge for my women’s size 7 foot, but comfy, so I brought them home, washed them, put them in the dryer, and they turned out just right. They served me well over the years, but began to wear out. I was happy to find them on Amazon, and ordered 3 pairs. What a disappointment! Although my feet are still the same size 7, the socks were tight, uncomfortable, and flimsy, even compared to the old, worn ones!  They are made in China. I don’t know if the old ones were also, but the quality now definitely is poor. Returned for refund."
2.0,"Opened package & immediately noticed threading coming out all over the left sleeve & left armpit area. Threading has come out enough of the left sleeve that it’s not threaded correctly anymore & further use & washing of item will continue to deform it more.<br />Product also is way smaller in the sleeves than anticipated. I like my sweatshirts loose so I wear XXXL, but this one is SUPER-tight in the sleeves."
2.0,"Pretty necklace, but it reflects the words in mirrored view.  Contacted seller and no response from them  Disappointed."
2.0,"nice quality, however the color of this is much darker than picture shows. Did not show up on black shirt."
2.0,ITS TO SHORT!!!!
2.0,The top was normal sized but the shirts were tiny. I had to return.
2.0,"Now I absolutely loved the dress when I took it out of package but when I tried it on the shape of it was all wrong...like it loose at the top and the pockets on the side were way to high  then the dress narrowed when it got to hips. I took measurements of myself before I purchased the product so this dress confused me...beautiful colors,suoersoft but the cut was way off...sigh"
2.0,"The hat itself seems fine, but man is it tiny! Would be good for a small child."
2.0,"Baggy, wrinkles easily. Way, way too thin to be considered a hoodie. Completely see-through. I wouldn’t even consider this a flannel shirt. Old navy and Walmart have plaid shirts that are thicker and better quality."
2.0,Material to thin bottoms look like diaper. Top doesn't have elastic to hold boobs in first layer just loose material so don't lift your arms up in this suit.heaven forbid you jumped in water it wouldn't cover anything.
2.0,I ordered a dusty purple and got a very BRIGHT lavender. I hate the color so I only wear it around the house or as a night shirt. Really disappointing. Comfortable shirt.
2.0,"I really like the look of the dress,  but question  the measurements.  It runs  extremely small and doesn't leave room for breasts.  I will return it, if it doesn't fit my much smaller daughter."
2.0,"The elephant is a lot larger than I thought it would be, but I can find a use for it.  The chain was really cheesy and did not have a clasp.  I had to buy another chain for it."
2.0,Too small and a little see through
2.0,This is the third pair of See Kai Run's we have owned and I am really dissapointed with this pair. The back does not have the padding like lots of other SKR shoes and we have only owned them for 2 weeks and already the leather sole is pulling up from the inside of the shoe.
2.0,I returned them - they were too large and not at all what I expected.
2.0,Beautiful bag . Bad quality .<br />Purchased about 18 months ago and used lightly 4 times as carry on .<br />- first zipper on small packet broke<br />- then main zipper broke and bag ripped near strap<br /><br />Wish zippers were better quality and i could get more use out of this great looking bag .
2.0,"Elastic waistband is tight and bulky.  Pants don’t hang correctly.  Wrinkle badly !<br />Waste of money, not able to wear.  Not worth the money to send back."
2.0,I love these types of little shoes however i ordered ones with sea green unicorns with purple hair and got white unicorns with gold.
2.0,"BOUGHT 3 PANTS,VERY DISAPPOINTED,DEFINETLY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.THE POOREST MATERIAL YOU COULD FIND,ALSO VERY SEE THROUGH"
2.0,It's ok type
2.0,"I really liked the colors of this dress and the length was spot on.  It was supposed to be a loose and flowy, but was very form fitting.  I had even gone up a size.  I ended up returning."
2.0,Beautiful textured jacket. I selected this item to wear with sleeveless dresses into the office; it gets very chilly in the summer months. It arrived and I immediately tried it on...only to be disappointed that sleeves and shoulders were too slim.
2.0,So disappointed in these because they fit so well but the black is so transparent! Don't get these if you are planning to actually workout in them. I have the teal colored ones too and for some reason they're not see-through.
2.0,I bought this for my mom who is in a wheelchair. I was disappointed by how small it was. My mom is not a large woman but it was very small almost as if it was made for a child.
2.0,It looked like it had been worn. I ordered a large and an extra large. The extra large was stuffed in the plastic bag. Not folded. Appeared to have been previously worn. Also very stretched out. The large was neatly folded and fine.I returned both and got a different color in smaller size.
2.0,"Color is close, not as dark of a red in person. Description stated small as US 4-6. I'm a solid 4, the dresses looks like I'm wearing a Momo...way too big. I'm going to need it taken in about 3-4 inches on each side. Shipping was about a week sooner than expected."
2.0,"I ended up returning this bathing suit. I was really excited for the retro high waisted look, and ordered the size according to their chart, however the top fit well, but the bottoms were just oddly loose to the point that it really wasn't flattering. Mine also did not come with the modesty cup inserts (I usually remove them anyways, but still). I have two other Cocoship bathing suits that I ordered according to the size chart and I am absolutely obsessed with them, but this one just really fell short of the mark. Wish I were able to order the top in one size and the bottom in another. For reference, I'm 5'5&#34; 36DDD, generally a size 12 at 175 lbs."
2.0,Color very true to picture..zipper is very hard to zip without help.
2.0,Everything about the fit if dress was perfect. The rating is based on fabric being so thin it is see through and the hem is unfinished. The quality overall is terrible. There are similar dresses on Amazon that are much better.
2.0,"I like the idea of this item but I'm not sure they come in just one size, its tight in between the toes so after waiting over a month to get them....cant use them"
2.0,A lot smaller than appears in pictures. It’s maybe the size of an average ant and the chain is extremely thin. Seems like it’s meant for a baby. I returned.
2.0,I returned this because it was recommended to dry clean
2.0,runs really small.  I ordered a 2xl and it was super tight.  couldn't even zip it up.  I am a 1xl and wanted it roomy.  they were really good with returns though.
2.0,I liked the material but it has no stretch and it is not particularly cut in an oversized fashion like the photo shows. If I ordered again I would order a size up if not two for a slouchy look.
2.0,"Good necklace, bit birth stone color was way off."
2.0,"Not well made, and material is cheap! Not happy."
2.0,The earrings are very very small.
2.0,Shirt was great fits like the 9-12 mo like I ordered but the pants are the size of a 2t
2.0,It is a lot wider and does not lay nice like in the picture.
2.0,Looks good but not comfy at all.  The cut of the pants pull on my legs as though someone skimped on the cloth.  This is not what I'm looking for in lounge wear.  Waste size seemed to fit fine so going up in one size didn't seem ideal either.  Just a odd cut pattern.  Really tall and thin people might find otherwise but I'm definitely do not have fat legs.  YMMV
2.0,Doesnt work as well for the back area.  The front sometimes but it will eventually move up.  Just hope the strap doesnt go up then it will look even more funny.
2.0,No pockets:(
2.0,The fabric wasn’t as nice as expected
2.0,"If it's not the magnet part of the band sticking to anything metal it comes in contact with, then it's the actual band getting stuck in clothes. Beyond annoying"
2.0,"This was in no way a junior women's size. I ordered the tank for my 15 y/o daughter, and this fit my 6 y/o better. No joking. If you have any shape to you, including boobs, this tank will NOT fit. Sorry. It was so cute, too!!"
2.0,Ok product but the seller is dreadful and will only respond if you give a good review. Amazon did the right thing and took the bag back. Thye bag I bought had a problem and the seller would not respond to my requests for repair or replacement. It did look good and was big.
2.0,"This shirt was huge disappointment. It was on sale and I was so excited to get an oversized flannel for such a great price! I ordered 1 size up to make sure it was oversized. When it arrived and I tried it on, it fit and was definitely loose but wasn’t oversized by any means and I even sized up, so it definitely runs small. Even so, I would’ve kept it if it hadn’t been made of such awful material. It feels like cheap plastic. I know that sounds crazy but seriously. I don’t know how else to describe it. Not even remotely warm or comfy or anything a flannel is supposed to be. Really just not good at all. Will be returning."
2.0,I never bought
2.0,Very pretty but the post is incredibly long so it spins on my ear and sticks very far off the back of my ear. Also made my ear very sore. I have had this piercing for 20+ years its never been sore since the original piercing.
2.0,"This dress was ok but I must return it for a few reasons.  First, the material is rather thin and cheap feeling, I did not like the quality of the dress fabric because of this.  The ruching is good to flatter if you have a little pouch but most of my problem was with the chest area.  There are no buttons/zipper or anything on the v neck part so it just lays open on your chest, which isn't a problem if you have a smaller chest, like the model in the picture.  For me (i'm 36DD), it gapped open and the top of the v neck nearest my collarbone just flapped awkwardly whenever I moved.  It's almost like you need safety pins or something to hold it up, but the fabric is so thin, it just does whatever.  I really wanted to like it though."
2.0,Was quite surprised when this came! Was not at all like the picture! The picture made this seem a lot thicker like a jacket and better quality. Not the case. Kinda cheap looking and not thick. Light weight. Kinda wish I had gotten a medium.
2.0,Pretty dress but way too small!
2.0,The material was not soft or stretchy at all. Felt very rigid and on the rough side. I returned these and received a refund
2.0,They were bent on arrival and broke about a week later. But for $8.00 what could I really expect.
2.0,"So the material is nice... I am a size small in everything but this fit weird. Tight on my waist and loose up top... tried wearing a jacket with it to help but 10 minutes into wearing it, one of the seams ripped. Im 5 foot 4 and am petite but this dress kept hiking up and was so short... on me, a short person!<br />Returning"
2.0,Too small I had to return it
2.0,didn't care for these  to dark  to big
2.0,"I wanted to love this product. The quality of the material and construction is fantastic. I love the color and style. But the sizing is way, way off. At best, the XL will fit a size 14 (and that's pushing it). The torso is also ridiculously short. I couldn't get it over my shoulders. They need to reevaluate their size chart and be honest with consumers. What a waste of my time."
2.0,Fit Larger than expected
2.0,"I LOVE this dress and how it looks (especially the pockets),  but I only put the dress on for the second time and noticed a big rip in the top of the skirt, right at my stomach.  If this rip didn’t appear, this would be you would be five stars. Sadly, there are no returns, so it’s wasted money on the stress."
2.0,The buckle is amazing but the belt is a bit shoddy. The leather belt has a two pieces laminated together.  After about 6 months of almost daily wear it delaminated. I like the buckle so much I bought another and it did the same. If they would put a good belt with this buckle it would be 5 stars.
2.0,It broke with a week the loop came off
2.0,"Different color scheme and length than shown in picture. I saw other reviews claiming this as well so I will include a picture of what you will actually receive. As you can see the whole shirt is a light gray, except the white dress shirt part."
2.0,This product caused a rash and itching on my skin.
2.0,"Very cute, but clasp broke the first time I wore it."
2.0,This band is impossible to attach to watch<br />I change my bands often and these bans are just too impossible<br />To use
2.0,Cheap. Small.
2.0,Ordered XL. Fits like a small. Disappointing.
2.0,"Is see-through and much, much shorter than it looks. It also retains heat like the infernos of hell."
2.0,"These glasses were a big disappointment. I bought these for my 8 year old sons baseball tournament. He played one game with them and the fit well and stayed on. After the first game the glasses popped out and we were unable to get them back in. I tried, my husband tried, my son tried and they just don't fit into the track. A total waste of money."
2.0,it was not easy to get shoe on foot
2.0,I'm 5 ft 125 32 DD. Does a bra is beautiful in color I ordered the light blue. It was very digging to my armpits and back a little bit rough on the material side. I wanted to like it so bad because the cut was nice but I'll just return it.
2.0,"I bought these without reading the washing instructions. You are supposed to hand wash and lay them flat to dry. I hate that. Especially since I didn't notice until after I washed them. They are now at least two inches shorter. If I would have known I had to hand wash them, I NEVER would have bought them. It will be interesting to see how much they keep shrinking. Maybe I will have ankle pants soon."
2.0,Not quite a crop top but not quite the “normal” tank length. Tight fit throughout and runs small. Not a horrible buy but due to the fit not something I’ll wear very often.
2.0,"These socks were inexpensive.  You get what you pay for.  Don't be a tightwad, and spend a little more.  They're socks, and socks are one of the most important and most taken for granted articles of clothing.  These are uninspiring.  I think wool, and I think warm.  These ain't warm.  They're thin and they stretch out easily.  wouldn't buy these again.  In fact, the whole catalog of the company was full of cheap, cheesy stuff."
2.0,This item was way to small and not attractive to my body style one bit.  I returned them.
2.0,"First, the label was not the manufacturer shown. Second, the material is questionable. I opened bag and black fluff came out all over. Looks used. I handwashed 2x and still shedding. I think this is a knock off."
2.0,"Very small, doesn't even fit around my ankle."
2.0,Does not look like the picture. Has cheaper material and weird lines.
2.0,Pin is small. Hard to see print
2.0,We received a bag similar but not the one that is in the picture.
2.0,"Super cute but the material is kind of like,., a kids Halloween costume. Can't see it lasting through more than a few wears."
2.0,"The short material is great, light, and the top fits well. The bottom of the shirt though is incredibly short and barely reaches your waist, unless you are small statured. I am in the process of trying to request a refund but have not had the easiest time so far, nor have I received a shipping label. I will update as necessary to reflect any changes in the customer service/company responses reflecting the websites satisfaction guarantee statements.<br /><br />Update: Seller offered to return 60% of the purchase."
2.0,"Is really quite bad in reality. Boots aren't boots, hat is a flimsy hat not a helmet of course, and no whip. Keep expectations lows"
2.0,Cheap. Can’t get the ball off of half of them. Turned my skin green within a few hours
2.0,I was expecting better quality from this watch band. I purchased this to replace the original band on my smartwatch. This is weak and flimsy and doesn't have any cushion in comparison to my other band that was previously on  my watch. This band I purchased maybe will last 60 days of wear if I am lucky. Save yourself some money and buy a better quality band.
2.0,"Looks cute, fit good, but one of the plastic things that attaches shoulder strap snapped before I could wear it even one time ☹️"
2.0,"If you're planning on moving around at all, this isn't very good. Kept falling down even though the compression was adequate."
2.0,I love it but you can see through it.
2.0,The sleeves were too long and the middle a bit snug; the material was not as expected.
2.0,"Gorgeous and flattering cut but it easily shows sweat, the material on the shoulder pilled after I wore it for only a couple hours, and it wrinkles easily. I steamed it before I wore it and the steamer left a mark in the front that I couldn’t get out, which never happened to my other clothes."
2.0,Hang dried to save the elastic and the color faded in random patches.
2.0,So short. I don’t think it will fit after I wash it the first time
2.0,"This is not my favorite. If it had a hassle free return, I'd have sent it back. Didn't fit as expected and offered minimal coverage and support compared to others I've bought."
2.0,Looks pink on white golf balls.  Ran out of ink fast.  Clear image.
2.0,"Missing hair scrunchie. Shorts have lots of strings, sloppy sewing. Shirt also has a few strings showing. Not pleased with the quality.  Advertised as 3 pc set but only shirt and shorts were in package."
2.0,"A bit expensive for the quality. A little short in length, a little wide. Worst problem is the soles on both shoes started falling off at the toes causing trip hazard. Had to glue them back together in less then a month."
2.0,I ordered an XL and it was not even close to that is size. Entirely too small. I gave it to my neice.
2.0,Great quality shirt. BUT. Medium size was actually a small. 7 day return but I missed the window
2.0,Product is very thin plastic. Once photos are inserted you will not be able to replace photos. I expect this to break very soon.
2.0,General wear to include golf and reg. use and while comfortable they were too casual to be practical for anything but limited use.
2.0,"Broke the first time i wore it, for a halloween costume so could be worse."
2.0,My husband normally wears an XL and I got him an XXL and they would not go past his thighs
2.0,Took the hooks off and ordered some wires to hang the circles off of. Way too small for me with this closure style. Small child size.
2.0,Pretty comfortable but after wearing them twice my husband informed me that they were see through. Pretty sad because they were the perfect leggings besides that... I love the waistband and everything else but sad they are see through
2.0,"The dress is beautiful, but the top is very uncomfortable and not well distribute for breast. Is holds your body together, but its bulky on your belly."
2.0,It is very cute but tiny!  My phone will barely fit in it.
2.0,Cute but it broke the first day I wore it
2.0,"Not as pretty in real life as it is in the picture. Also, it was a gift and the coat doesn’t have any tags on the outside or inside. Looks like it could’ve been worn already. Amazon’s sellers should start making tags on clothing. Not even a small/med /large tag - embarrassing"
2.0,Very small. I was expecting bigger earrings. Returning.
2.0,"I liked the style of the dress. It ran a bit small, though I followed the sizing instructions. What I really didn't like was the color. The grey was more like a T-shirt grey than a nice lace dress."
2.0,Not what I expected different from pictures but it fits so maybe it will grow on me
2.0,I was really excited to try this. I also wear at least 2 necklaces a day and I'm always getting frustrated because I'm always having to adjust the necklace back in place all the time. So I found this and the Idea is great and the necklaces fit perfectly but the magnet wasn't very strong. Everytime I even slightly pulled it the whole thing fell off. If I tried to change my shirt it would fall off. My necklaces have a lot of sentimental value to me so I was to scared I would loose them so I did return it. This product would be good for anyone who isn't too active  all the time.
2.0,Did not have backs to the earrings
2.0,"This outfit is lovely.  I took a chance that the XL would fit because it looked so full in the picture.  Even though it doesn't look it, the top is form fitted.  I also thought the pants would be too large but they also run small.  After that being said, I would order again if they had a larger size."
2.0,They broke on the frame within the first three days of wearing them. Nice sunglasses but cheaply made.
2.0,Cheaply made and ripped on the first use. I do not recommend this poncho.
2.0,I am a 10/12 and ordered a 3XL - it fit upon first trying it. I washed it once in a dedicates bag/cold and hung dry it. It shrunk so significantly that it is too small now. Waste of money....
2.0,nice pair of shoes but left shoe is bigger than the right shoe?!<br />kicked one off just walking normally around the house.<br />arrived on time.  no problems with the seller except the product!
2.0,These did not look like the picture!!! They looked like a skirt!!! And was absolutely big!! I had to sew them smaller and give to my daughter.
2.0,Huge capacity is a huge overstatement. This wallet only holds about half of my previous one. The RFID protection is minimal if any at all. No wrist strap and no pen loop. Had to leave lots out or it wouldn't even fasten. Highly disappointed.
2.0,"It's not my style. Very pretty print but didn't like the fit. It is very shear , so you have to wear something underneath."
2.0,It was very tight and hard to breathe in. I wouldn't recommend it
2.0,One beats was broken
2.0,"Nice look, kept hands warm. However they got wet and did not dry well inside. Had to buy different because they began smelling after a few uses."
2.0,I like the dress<br />But a large is not really a large is more a small size.
2.0,"I haven't found ANY of this caliber that work. While they all say 15-20 mm, they are hard to get on and extremely hard to get off at night. If no one is here to help me, sometimes it's agony. Caveat, I am female and my strength is in my legs, not my arms. It's hard on the thumbs, the shoulders, neck. I HAVE thought of just cutting them off, but that would void my return [lol ya think?]"
2.0,The ears are great looking but very hard to get on and keep on.  We ended up getting a different pair that worked really well. These ears don't bend much. Pretty hard plastic
2.0,The neck area is too big.  It seems stretched out and shows my bra straps.  I am ok with just a bit of it showing but not all of it. And it also feels like it wants to stretch more.  Im not returning because I've worn it and got perfume on it but would have otherwise.
2.0,"These glasses look super cute. But the inside of the glasses tend to lay completely down the nose line, so if you wear foundation while wearing these, you have a nice long mark in your foundation along the side of your nose. Because I wear sunglasses on my way to work, I can't have my foundation getting that messed up, so I had to stop wearing these. If they had more of a defined spot to sit high on the nose, these would be perfect."
2.0,I bought this dress because it looked more like a nice sun dress but once it arrived it was more like a cover up for the beach
2.0,Its a tank top! Sheesh. I regret buying it. It isn't at all worth the cost.
2.0,I specifically ordered this product because it offered a silver and a gold. However I only received 2 gold. And it's already turned to my neck green. Extremely disappointed.
2.0,It kept coming loose. And also would pinch my skin.
2.0,The face paint was very hard. We had to add water to make it work even a little.
2.0,"Fit is as expected and material is nice and thick and not very see through so with the white I could have used many light colored bras. My issue is there is a second layer of fabric in the front to make it less see through, but it ends right across mid bust and you can see the texture of it plain as day. Disappointing design to an otherwise great dress."
2.0,From the picture you feel like you’re getting a sleek stylish watch that is a decent size and quality at an affordable price. The reality is that what you get feels like a small dinner plate on the wrist. The band is extremely stiff and makes it very uncomfortable to wear and difficult to put on.
2.0,These shoes broke immediately after I tried them on. One buckle popped off completely (I was able to reattach it but I dont think it will hold for long) and the other buckle cracked. Also they came a little dirty. Overall I would say save your money.
2.0,Did not come with chain.
2.0,Its beautiful but it turns my wrist green within hours. I have 10 watch bands and this is the only one that has ever done that. Returning.
2.0,"Thought I was getting a good deal. The material is too thin and looks really cheap.  Not going to be able to use these as a gift, like I intended.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,Hmmm Bret
2.0,"Pretty solid design, weight and thickness of the rings was just what I was looking for. I was pretty stoked this was a three pack even though I was mainly looking for a gold ring. Rings were actually delivered early. Took the gold one out, opened it and it broke. The other two seemed to be alright, but like I said I was going for the gold one. Refund went though without a problem and didn't have to return, so that was appreciated. Wish it would have worked out seeing as they were just about perfect."
2.0,Zipper button broke off after the first day.
2.0,"I ordered the small and I'm 130 pounds, 5'5&quot;.  It came way too large. It looks nice and good quality but I just can't wear it because it was too big."
2.0,Feathers Coming out of Every Needle Hole!!  Makes a mess and looks like pet hair on the car seats and my clothes.  I returned it after wearing it a few times.  Nice style but what a mess!
2.0,Too small.  Went from Tank Top to compression shirt
2.0,I do not care for these glasses. Never have I owned a pair of sunglasses that just sat flat across my face with no shape or curve or nothing. Now I have.<br /><br />I thought these looked like aviators a little from the picture. They aren’t.<br /><br />They look cheap. They feel cheap. They don’t really even do a good job of blocking the sun because my face isn’t flat.<br /><br />They seem like glasses that would go with a cheap Halloween costume.<br />Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,"I like the vintage looking Timex pieces, mostly because you can change out watch bands.  This one in particular died on me after a few months of use.  I changed out the battery, and the hour hand lost movement."
2.0,"Sweatshirt looks nice, but runs small and short, very much a crop top sweater."
2.0,Dont bother thinking these would be good for a septum piercing. The shape is very uncomfortable<br /> I had to bend them with pliers to help the shape.<br /><br />One of the pieces of jewelry was also missing in the pack despite me paying for it.
2.0,"I wanted to like this watch and I would, except for the fact that condensation forms on the inside and thus obscures the view (pretty much defeating the purpose). It dissipates when I'm not wearing it (see previous parenthetical comment) but forms again when I put it on. I don't think of myself as a particularly damp person, so I have to think we're looking at product issues here. I've neglected to take care of this in time and the return window closed yesterday--totally my fault for not being on top of it."
2.0,"I really like the black and white polka dot skirt that I recently bought from this brand so I decided to splurge on the holiday skirt.  I unpacked the skirt and was disappointed because they’d sent me the wrong size.  The skirt’s material looked cheap, too, compared with other skirts I’d bought on Amazon. I’m returning the item ASAP."
2.0,It’s absolutely adorable however it broke within minutes of it being put onto my husbands keys. The circles keep falling off of the ring that was provided to keep them together on the keys. I’m extremely disappointed and my husband is heartbroken.
2.0,"Smaller than usual. I have ordered these before. I ordered 1 size up, L & they are smaller than the Medium<br />i already have!?"
2.0,"Very tight, but stretch well. COMPLETELY SEE-THROUGH."
2.0,"Product is not at all as described. Well I guess the color was accurate. Otherwise fits different than described, sizing very inaccurate. Wouldn’t recommend."
2.0,Got the colors I didn't want
2.0,"Wide bore laces, not good for hiking boots with small eyelets."
2.0,Need to fix there sizing chart measurements
2.0,"This top is cute but VERY short, I have a short torso and it hardly falls below my chest. I even sized up but that makes it more boxy and doesn't add any length. If you are into the super cute cropped looked then it would workout, disappointing because  paying for return shipping would cost basically as much as the shirt does."
2.0,I ordered it the size I was supposed to and it was still to small
2.0,"The dress is really cute, but the cutouts are way too high. My butt was exposed through the cutouts. For reference, I'm 5'4&#34;, so not very tall. If planning on wearing with leggings underneath it would be cute, but not appropriate as a dress with nothing underneath."
2.0,Love it changes colors great but to small. For better coverage get a size or two up from what you would normally get
2.0,Runs short through torso
2.0,The bar is very long. This item is over priced for a cubic zirconia and one earring.
2.0,I am unhappy with this watch. The buttons are very hard to use and I have been working with the support because I can't get it to operate correctly. They have suggested a different want for me to purchase for my elderly mother so I will probably be returning this this week.
2.0,"Fabric is slightly awkward and is large in some areas and fits normal in other areas. Cannot keep the wrinkles out even with starch. not what i was expecting, would not order again. I would have returned this dress because i will never wear it."
2.0,"My son use it only 1 week. Now, only half have light."
2.0,"Not very comfortable, difficult to slip your feet into due to the ankle area being a fixed size,  and made of obviously cheap materials.  I do not trust this product to protect my feet from much, especially not from punctures.  I have extreme doubts for the slip resistance, being that there is no tread, and they are achieving 0 traction on a dry concrete floor."
2.0,"This is an oddly shaped shirt. The shoulders are tight and the bottom kind of flares out. I wanted to like this, but alas, I really don't and will not be wearing it. The material is light, but itchy, and has no softness or bend to it. I can't recommend this product."
2.0,"For sizing, my neck measures 14.5 inches and it fit me perfectly. I wear a size 2XL and the front and back were able to lie flat due to the adjustable side straps. It didn't work for me, because the shoulders ended up riding up and sticking out under my shirt. It'd make a really good costume piece, but I was hoping to wear it to work, and that isn't going to be possible. I also thought from the image that it would be backed, but it's actually sheer lace."
2.0,The underwear is so big...the upper is Lil but small ...but love the color and style
2.0,Could not stand the draw string. Aesthetically cuts your body image short
2.0,The mouth holes are very un-centered. Pretty disappointed with them
2.0,Nice earrings. Wish they made them bigger hoops.
2.0,Gets dirty easy and when clean it the color comes off.
2.0,They are nice but the post is too thick and I wasn't able to wear them but for 2 minutes and my ears started burning due to the pain. Very sad about this.
2.0,I ordered a medium that was a snug fit. I would go a size up if I were to order it again. It really doesn’t look like the picture. It’s not a bad pullover though. Textures outer layer and seems to be lined with softer material.<br />Visible loose string at the collar though.<br />I’m returning based on size and not really the look I wanted.
2.0,Broke when I wore for second time on strap.
2.0,Really nice belt but after a month it broke.
2.0,The length is the main problem they come to short
2.0,"Both my boyfriend and I have the same phone, so I bought 2 of these cases from Amazon.com and 4 additional ones for later in case they happen to break.  I was actually hoping the case would hold up for 3-4 months each, but unfortunately, both my boyfriend and I used up all 6 cases (3 each) in just 1 month.  With approximately $5 each excluding tax/shipping, that was $30 I spent for one month for the both of us.  I'll admit the item fitted nicely, and helped retain the phones original 'good looks' with the casing on; however, the durability is poor.  Maybe if this casing was used in combination of another soft casing (like one of those cell phone pockets made of cloth/leather) this will last longer."
2.0,"Beautiful color, weird sizing and cut. I'm a solid extra small. Rarely do I have to size up. This suit is held together by a very short string contraption you have to tighten in the back. When I pulled the strings to tighten- my skin would overflow out the back like a bound piece of smoked honey baked ham.<br /><br />Also it gives you a front wedgie. If you like it size up."
2.0,Crystal a lot bigger than expected. Looks ridiculous in my nose.
2.0,Way too small and uncomfortable. Wedgies galore!
2.0,"I still have doubts this is from Japan, but this kaku obi feels sturdy and strong not like the very elastic bull that is shiihan takashi brand. I still dont believe this came from Japan<br /><br />This obi is fraying way too easily rather sell it on eBay.."
2.0,The material is horrible it makes you sweat because it has so much polyester
2.0,Mine arrived today and doesn't look like the photo. The size was fine. But it looked faded and there are no pleats. I will be returning.
2.0,"I am 5'7&#34;, 125lbs, 36B. I ordered a size 6, which arrived labeled 'large'. The sleeves are slightly too short, while the rest of the shirt was much too baggy. It is also see-through. My bra was clearly visible, so you'd have to wear something underneath this. The buttons on the shirt are cheap plastic crystals, which I wasn't expecting. I ordered the pink shirt, which was more orange-pink than baby-pink, and it was a shade I didn't particularly like or think was very flattering. I cannot size down any since the sleeves were already too short. This shirt might fit a petite woman who isn't tall. If you're slim like me I'd try sizes 2 or 4 (which are probably small and medium, respectively).<br /><br />Overall, just not worth the price for me. You can buy much nicer blouses for $20 elsewhere."
2.0,I bought this for my 2 year old. Its actually says 3 to 5yrs and its still a bit short
2.0,Very poor quality. It came wadded up in a ball
2.0,"These pants were slightly too large, way too long, and see through. I had to return them."
2.0,"Glasses broke the first day my son had them. I’ve bought cheaper glasses that have lasted longer. He’s 3 so he’s not the most careful with stuff, but he had his previous pair for over a year before I lost them."
2.0,They were so tight they caused bruises on my calves.
2.0,Unfortunately for being an XL. I couldn’t get the top or dress over my chest. It’s smaller than it says on the site. Unfortunately these things happen. Delivery came swiftly and earlier than expected. Package is nice and able to see what you get.
2.0,"These feel like wearing tights. The material is like a thick pair of flexible tights. They have that itchy characteristic like tights and the minute I put them on, I regret having bought them. Completely see-through when you bend over."
2.0,I love the fit but unfortunately my cream dress came with a pink stain on it. Currently deciding if I’ll try to get it out or return it as it’s now out of stock.
2.0,Two small in the bust area
2.0,The thickness of the button is very thin. They felt cheap and flexible. I ended up not using these buttons and finding a higher quality product from a button company instead.
2.0,Clasp would not close had to return
2.0,Way to big! hope it srinks!
2.0,"The leotard is a high-quality made item. It's made from very durable stretchy material oh, very pretty. Unfortunately it was way too small. I am 5ft 2in and weigh 110 lb. I usually wear a size small but I ordered a medium. Even the medium was way too small."
2.0,I'm not even sure what type of material this is but it's obviously cheap--it's rough and for lack of a better word &#34;porous&#34;…it looks very nice in the picture and wile the color is the same it is not that cute at all…I would not recommend buying this scarf.
2.0,I ordered a 2 sizes larger that my normal shoe size and this item is still too small.  Hopefully it will stretch out with wear.
2.0,"Update: I received a replacement band but it’s exactly the same. I like the band but not the color. Sent back and continuing to look for something else.<br /><br />The band is nearly identical in design to my original Apple band. However, the color is way off. It was advertised as pink sand but you can see in the picture it’s really more of a beige flesh color. I’m contacting the seller to see if I got a miscolored band but if not it’s going back since it looks worse than my faded band."
2.0,"Very cute cap but not for high ponytails as described. Cap has regular sized opening in back, positioned where regular openings are. If looking for a high ponytail slot, do not purchase this one."
2.0,Product size is not accurate
2.0,"This dress is only $20 and you do get what you paid for. The inner liner is not as pictured, it is actually 20&#34; shorter that the embroidered mesh overlay making for an awkward look. The bodice is short waisted, fitting half an inch higher than my actual waist giving the illusion of a chunky top. On the skirt part of the dress,  gathers were not well distributed and seem haphazard bunching in weird places. It is still wearable just not to someplace special. After all it is only a $20 dress. The concept is good but the execution is bad."
2.0,"After one day of wearing, the sweater starting to develop those tiny balls of fabric that you need shave off.  This is even before it was washed for the first time.  The additional start is for design, Iooks sharp."
2.0,"I ordered a size large or size 8. I received 2 pairs XL and 1 pair XXL, needless to say that these items were unfortunately much too large and won't work out. However, aside from the size they are very soft and seem like a quality product.<br />I was bummed the wrong size was delivered."
2.0,Fit well and comfortable but I expected real sequins not a print that is supposed to look like sequins
2.0,A little to thin and short length in the arms. Other than that there ok.
2.0,MUCH more red than maroon in real life. Cute cut but because of the off coloring I returned it.
2.0,Very cheap made watch. You get what you pay for here
2.0,Not true  to it size
2.0,it waa too small. only went over my chest. I cant even return it since id go through a whole hassle of trying to send it back. waste of your 7 dollars if you have melons.
2.0,Check your size.  Cheap looking
2.0,Runs super small. Fabric is odd.
2.0,Chain to  necklace look very cheap. But since was cheap I won't complain.
2.0,"I loved these masks, my bf had bought us some at the start of the pandemic and I decided to order some more two years later. These however are much larger but it could also be because we purchased it from the actual site, not amazon. My only complaint is the medium large is more like a large. Next time I'd order a small medium."
2.0,I returned it material was not what I expected.
2.0,"I usually wear an XL, so I bought the 1X thinking it would be a nice loose fitting top. Not the case. It was tight across the bust and arms and the pattern was not as flattering as on the screen. I do like the sexy buttons up look in the back. Super bummed nothing else was what I expected."
2.0,"Colors are beautiful, very tight, material is smothering."
2.0,"They may keep your fingers from getting burned if you can manage to keep them on, and by that I mean size wise and if you can actually pick your hair up with them with only one hand. If styling someone's hair and using two hands, this may be possible, but alone seems to be nearly impossible."
2.0,"Returned this item. The sleeves were basically skin tight on me, as well as the rest of the cardigan. There was no flowy aspect to it as there is in the photos. I had high hopes for this but it did not meet my expectations."
2.0,Too loose for child head.
2.0,Some came broken. Not very sturdy
2.0,"Maybe it was the color, but it looked like a nightgown on me. I sent it back. It is well made and the fabric is nice, but as they say it looks better on the rack."
2.0,"Overall, this will work. However, none of the sizes were labeled.  which would be fine, if all of the sizes were here. But since I have three T<br />tapers that have no matching partner, & a few pairs of tunnels that are missing, it would be nice if the sizes were labeled so I knew what I still needed. Kind of disappointing"
2.0,"I ordered ""brown"" and got brick-red pants. The picture clearly shows ""brown"". Other than that, they fit well and feel nice."
2.0,The shells broke within 2 days of wearing...won't but again
2.0,"Way to tight, small"
2.0,"Took about almost 3 weeks. They were nice and looked exactly like the picture is shown. Too bad I didn't like it because the piece that goes in your ear pierce is a little too big for my piercing. My ears were pulsing with the earrings on which hurt. If it wasn't for that, I would've gave these 5 star!"
2.0,had it for a week and the strap broke.
2.0,Just didn’t like how it fit
2.0,"Not what it looked to be. It's t-shirt material, on the thin side and there is no shape to it. Not flattering at all. It just falls off and sort of sloops everywhere. Not easy to have to weave the 2 ""strings"" through all of the loops on the front and also all of the loops of the back of the item."
2.0,"Advertised as long, needed for gym,was fairly short, had to return. .pic shows long tank, was not."
2.0,"When this bracelet arrived, it looked beautiful. The problem, however, is that the writing faded VERY quickly. It is such a beautiful message and I am so disappointed that it wore off within weeks."
2.0,Cheap fabric. Low quality
2.0,The color is beautifull so It's too small. I cound't use it.
2.0,As soon as I got on the highway they came undone and I have standard snaps on my vest.
2.0,"The way I received the paxkaging, I was confused on how to even put them on. Also didn't like that it came with padding cups, that were sewn in. I don't like them"
2.0,Product does not fit at all with my normal size
2.0,It is a ladies watch.
2.0,This is NOT DOUBLJU. material is good but color fades and shirt shrinks little. Better off buying name brand for the same price.....
2.0,"Just did not like the way it look on me, the white against the black was not really flattening, it look Cheap"
2.0,Sure is pretty.  Wish it fit.  Order up a size!
2.0,These were beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. Too bad the construction of the clasp wasn't up to par. One of the earrings fell off within 20 minutes of wearing it. Lost forever. $25 down the drain. :(
2.0,"Sweatshirt is not as bright as pictured.  It’s more of a dull pink.  Not really what I expected.  Otherwise, it fits, and is good quality. If it was more than $16 I’d send it back.  😡"
2.0,If you're tall it won't work. The torso is so short. It stretches width wise but length wise it's very small.
2.0,"Sadly they were not the right size, they were too small. I was suggested by Amazon to purchase a small, most of my leggings are small, (very few are mediums and those are said to run small). They seem like really good quality and im sure I would love them if they fit. ): I don't really know if you should size up?"
2.0,I wear a size 26. I got the 2x/3x and while I could get the dress on- the stretchy areas were a bit too tight. I also am 6ft tall and the dress came up well above my ankles. I got my mum to try it on- she wears about a 14 and she said it felt too small as well.<br />Also the material is a very cheap polyester that feels like it will tear easily and has no air flow.
2.0,It's a very handsome ring. But I banged my hand against something and part of the paint flecked off.
2.0,Great product. Not very warm.
2.0,Falls off at the slightest bump not good for everyday wear
2.0,"Too small for my fat head. The center pushes downward, so it won fit snuggly. Decent looking, though it ain't fit for a king."
2.0,Shrinks and ties broke.  Not good.
2.0,too wide for my taste.
2.0,"I sent it back it was to big for me, I order another one that I really like"
2.0,If you are very busty like over 40d then this won't be a flattering look because the waist is way too high and will make it look like you are suffocating. I got an XL in red. I liked the length. I am 5'1 so it came past my knees.  It is also a bit see through like I could see my color of my bra. Not so cute..
2.0,Arch is very high almost impossible to walk in.
2.0,"I was happy to get such a warm, soft robe at this price, but, unfortunately, I have already found two holes after just a few days of wearing it."
2.0,These are thigh high stockings..... not thigh high socks 😔😒
2.0,They are still operational but crack after one month of use. Do not buy this.
2.0,"The pendant is pretty as every other pendant that looks exactly the same but I was so pissed and disappointed the description states “CRYSTAL” for the gems and these things are “PLASTIC” if it would of stated plastic stones then people would know what they’re buying. It’s not like a expected real gems but I expected atleast glass, or atleast to know what I’m paying for is plastic gems like the ones in my 3 year olds toys, these gems are also dull no shine or sparkle to them. I actually had to put water and rub the hearts and only some got a bit shiny the others are horrible. I’m so angry to be giving this as a gift it’s embarrassing I’ve gotteb glass stones on cheaper items."
2.0,I guess it's ok for what it is but would it hurt to have them clear glass or plastic?  You can't see through them they make everything blurry. I had them on with the Santa suit and could not read the gift tags through them.
2.0,Not a fan.  Should of sent them back immediately.  The reflective glare on the inside is pretty bad.  Cheaper plastic frames than I was expecting
2.0,Ordered a small based on sizing and it was just cut too large in all the wrong places. Would be a great top if cut better though!
2.0,These were too small and don’t believe the size given was correct. I now need to get one size bigger.
2.0,"I bought a size up and it still didn't fit right — there wasn't enough fabric to cover my chest (which isn't huge). It's also very thin and transparent, so I would need to wear a full slip underneath. Really wanted to love this, but unfortunately I had to return it."
2.0,Thought they would fit tighter an be a little larger. Slip off my head to much
2.0,The ears are pretty good! The tail is pretty cheap though. The collar is too big to fit snugly around my neck. The wrist cuffs are also to big to fit snuggly around my wrists. And the gloves are pretty cheap too; the pinky fingers are much too long. Altogether cute but the flaws make this overpriced.
2.0,Package came within a week which was great! The bag itself was not made well. Very cheap leather but an honest worth $15 buy. I would purchase other items from this company.
2.0,"For the price it’s fine, but don’t expect the silver version to last. It seems as though the rings are painted versus being made with colored silicone. After less than a week my husband and I both have rings with silver wearing off. And mine looks like it has a fingerprint over the “stone.” Disappointing because we wanted an option that looked more realistic instead of the more vibrant colors. Have had another popular brand silicone ring that was a bit more expensive for a few years and it still looks brand new."
2.0,The tail itself is cute.<br />The strap however. It's NOT adjustable (even tho the listing says it is) and it is definitely not made for the average adult waist.
2.0,"The fit is off...too loose at chest and too short in length. The material is soft but it looks a bit more stiff on the model. This is a cheap material that will definitely shrink at the first wash. I won't return it because the price was pretty cheap and not worth my time. I'll probably wear it once and give it away.  Also, it came pretty wrinkled in the package so it was probably returned once already."
2.0,"They are cute, but the material is very scratchy."
2.0,One of the &#34;tabs&#34; on the loom broke before my daughter could even use it Christmas morning.  The blue pieces used to connect the loom are smaller than the Rainbow loom holes so they do not fit together well and come apart easily while working on your bracelets etc. The edges are rougher than the original.  This is not a Rainbow Loom it is a generic imitation but does work with some patience and delicacy as to not snap the cheap plastic.  If you are looking for a more affordable alternative this product will work but you will be planning to replace it in the near future.
2.0,Gems in collar are not all attached and move around behind the mesh of the colllar often backwards. Otherwise great.
2.0,"These are very stiff in spring-action. I’ve worn cheaper ones that were more comfortable. The biggest problem is that they start hurting and irritating the skin after extensive wear. A couple of hours in, and the area starts turning red. Not from any allergic reactions, but from the clasp being so tight and not springing with the movement of the nose. Ouch!"
2.0,It’s see through so you can see everything
2.0,ran about 3 sizes to small. returned.
2.0,I didn’t like the design on me. It’s a pretty dress but not for me
2.0,I ordered a large because I wanted the bottoms to be baggy. The size was more like a girls large not an adult large.
2.0,Had to return as this came folded in thirds in a ziplock bag and then stuffed into a plastic shipping bag and taped tightly in an X pattern. This caused the visor to crease and the whole mask was so misshapen it was unusable. Tried letting it sit in the sun to release the folds with no luck. Not a helmet but a latex mask. Hope someone else has a better experience.
2.0,"These are great, well made, no threads hanging off everywhere. They're one sided which<br />is fine by me. They're well made hope they last.<br /><br />Update: I've worn the green one 5 times and washed it in cold water no dryer and most of the print<br />is gone. Only thing I can figure is it's painted on not dyed, if I wanted plain colors I would have bought a scarf.<br />Not good! I'll try the blue one and update."
2.0,They broke within a week
2.0,"These lasted a total of 2 hours before they broke.  They look interesting (I'll add a star for that), but they're really only practical for a steampunk costume or something, not for use as serious sunglasses."
2.0,I returned them because of the fit. If you are not a size 6 to 6 1/2 these sandals will not fit you. I believe they are made on the larger side of a six. I am a 5 1/2 and usually a six in that type of a sandal would fit but these ran a little big
2.0,"I ordered the beige to cover tattoos at work. I wear khakis and wanted something that would not look mismatched. They weren't beige, but more of a gold / yellow. They also did not have gathers on one end for your wrist like others I have ordered."
2.0,"Bought this ring about 2 months ago. Haven't worn it that much, did wear it today, very disappointed as it broke as I wearing it. The bottom of the band completely broke apart. Really loved this ring, thought it was better quality, but I guess not. Pretty disappointed."
2.0,"Everything sticks to the material (hair, fuzz, etc.)"
2.0,"I cannot figure out how to use this belt, even when I followed the directions it still comes untied."
2.0,Nice quality but sizes are way small. Had I known I would have but a size or two bigger.
2.0,The length is not accurate as the description
2.0,"This was stretchy but not stretchy enough to fit around my chest comfortably...I am a 36C...which was the main reason for return...but the sequined fabric used was very poorly constructed with many sequins falling off in just removing it from the packaging and trying it on once....it was also very itchy around the arms where the sequins would rub against your skin directly.  I returned it for a full refund, no problem...so that was good."
2.0,"Just an fyi to all;  this watch lasted 9 months, then quit.<br />We just ordered the ""Pangda Vintage Pocket Watch Gold Steel Men Watch with Chain for Fathers Day Gift"" as a replacement for almost twice as much.  Will enter a review on it when/if it dies within the year.  Stay tuned."
2.0,"The material overall seems to be pretty decent, but I have a couple of things that I don't like about this product. I don't have incredibly big lips, but they're full I'd say. The hoops that come in this pack are so incredibly tiny, I couldn't even use it for my labret. In addition to this jewelry being a little too small, the threading on some of these pieces is incredibly difficult to get all the way on. Comparing to the smooth glide of jewelry you get at an actual piercing shop, this does not meet up. Out of this entire set, I'm only able to use ONE piece."
2.0,I like the style that’s why I gave it two stars. But it fit too small had to get a larger size but still didn’t keep it because it fit too short. Became more of a male crop top to show my belly. Not what I really wanted so I returned it unfortunately
2.0,"Thin, bad stitching and not great quality."
2.0,"Short and after I washed it, it shrunk."
2.0,"I expected a thicker, looser dress and it wasn’t so, I ended up giving it away. It was pretty, but much too thin for my tastes."
2.0,"The color is just as pictured, it is a nice bright shade of green. The biggest flaw for me was that the division for the chest area is too high up in the dress and does not cover chest correctly, will need to pay to have this altered. It's a pretty dress, I expected more. It's just ok, but still need to fix flaw."
2.0,"While I could have given this item an additional star for being sterling silver, I was not entirely satisfied with how tiny the pendant was for the price and that it did not include a chain which might have made the purchase a little bearable."
2.0,they are very pretty but broke the first day and I don't know how to get them back to you
2.0,It was so cute and perfect minus being way too short! Bummer!
2.0,"These are a waffle like fabric, not see through and do give some compression. However the seem that goes up the front of the pants draws attention to the stomach and when you sit it pouches… these are really long (I’m 5’4” and had to fold over the hem and still had extra material. I returned them."
2.0,size is not true
2.0,"La calidad es hermosa, yo compre un talle más grande basándome en La foto de la descripción y resultó ser muy pequeño<br />Compre usa 10 cuando mi niña usa  talle usa9 y resultó ser pequeño"
2.0,"You can't really fasten them onto your wrist as they're made.  They're pretty, but they aren't functional."
2.0,Button popped off taking it out of the bag and is not true to color but I have the same one in a blue that was perfect.
2.0,Very cheap looking tie! Looks nice online but it's like dollar store quality.
2.0,"They earrings were not as pretty as I thought in the picture, however, They are nice for an afternoon of shopping nothing I would wear for date."
2.0,"Cute earrings.  But after 2weeks of wear, the gold finish is dulled considerably.  Unwearable now"
2.0,The material of the item was thin and looked cheap
2.0,Pendant is a blue colored metal and not silver or as shiny as shown in the pictures.
2.0,"Well, when I put the left sock on I liked it quite a bit. It went on well and fit nicely. When I went to put the other one on it felt crinkly at the top which I thought was weird but I went ahead and scrunched the sock as one does to pull it on the foot. All was going well until I got to the top of the sock. When I was pulling the top up it started to stretch and pull apart (with little pull, just the tug you would use to pull the top of the sock up). My fingers were starting to go through the fabric where the crinkling was. It was up at top between the first and third lines on the sock, to be more specific.<br />Anyway, for that reason I can't really give these socks a good recommendation. It does seem like most others had better luck with their socks so hopefully this was just a one off sort of thing. I liked the first sock a lot though!"
2.0,"Ford logo was very nice. Unfortunately it was put on a flimsy, small, light-weight cap. Too small for my husband’s head.<br />Disappointed."
2.0,"I wasn’t expecting a whole lot but I was definitely hoping the ring lasted longer than the 4 days I got out of wearing it before 2 stones fell out. The ring itself was beautiful. Perfect amount of petite feminine sparkle that I was looking for. Though I wasn’t expecting a high quality piece of jewelry to last a lifetime, I am sad that this was a waste of money. The 4 day beauty of the ring was the only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 as I was able to wear it to an event prior to the stones falling out."
2.0,I wore it 3 or four times then out of no where beads. Went eveywhere
2.0,"Pretty for the price, but the chain is very small."
2.0,"I actually liked the way the dress fit; however, the dress looked home-made.  I could have gotten over the home-made look, if the material was decent.  The material on the dress looked and felt like it was from the 70's.  Shiny and weird.  Just wrong, wrong, wrong.  I sent it back because I could not get over the material of the dress.  Just gross."
2.0,"The bracelet is held on by two giant brass snap buttons on the other side.  This keeps all the straps together and not as loose looking.  I was expecting a bracelet that was made up of many separate strands or maybe one long strand, but it is just one giant piece with an closure.  The material is really cheap and feels thin.  I am returning it."
2.0,"They didn't keep my fingers warm....I was cold all the time, especially my fingertips....."
2.0,"I was really excited to get these pants, I had put all the other colors in my cart but had the good sense to wait until until my first order arrived. I loved the material the pant style in general but when i buttoned it up it was AWFUL. It has sewing imperfections that made it twist to the side and pull. This cannot be fixed or covered up will definitely be returning.<br />UPDATE:<br />I decided to take a chance that maybe the imperfections was an anomaly so I sent the original back for a replacement. The new one fits a lot better, I'm still not 100% happy but ill still keep it"
2.0,Perfect size for my Amazon fire tablet but the Velcro tab ripped off almost immediately the first time I purchased it and still continued to love and use this bag. Years later bought another one to replace my worn original and I received this the other day without even using it with blemishes on the back....disappointed
2.0,Very small fitting. Also material is rough.
2.0,"This shirt is thin and wayyyy too big. I ordered a medium because I expected it to be some what small like everything else that’s ordered online, but when I got it and tried it on it was like a dress and not a cute one. I hate it. Even if I ordered a small I would still be returning it."
2.0,"Smaller than I thought it was. So I might give it away to a smaller person. (I’m 6 feet.) Still, a good weekend bag. Material is strong, especially the clips. Nice overall design. Good for the price, but it’s a basic bag and just not big enough. Pictures with models in ad were deceiving. Zippers are good, not the best quality."
2.0,The jacket died after a month!
2.0,The seems at the sleeves started tearing. The material isn’t soft. I returned this item.
2.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and they were still too small.  They are cute but they need to work with their sizing.  The chemical smell was also very strong.  Had to return.
2.0,Not as pictured very cheap looking
2.0,"I ordered these heated pants because I have a heated vest that works great and I was hoping heated pants would be just as good. Unfortunately, they only heat my knee caps slightly and only when I push the fabric down on my knees. They also run small on sizing."
2.0,"These socks were listed as Women's Socks to fit women's shoe size 5-9. I wear a size 7 to 7-1/2 shoe, so these should have fit perfectly. Somewhere else in the description, it says ""One-Size"", and in my order summary it said ""Uni-Sex"". Well, the package I received clearly said ""Men's"" and indeed they were. Way too large for me! I sent the seller feedback, in case I had received the wrong item but received no response.  They can call the size anything they want, but that won't make them fit. They were also quite scratchy and uncomfortable. These are going back!"
2.0,"For the price, can't complain too much, but this is comparable to other Miraclesuits in name only. Cheap quality, ungenerous fit. I'm keeping it as a back up suit for a cruise, but I don't like it very much."
2.0,It's a plain dress. If you dress it up in sure it's nice but there wasn't much of a shape to it. Not for me.
2.0,Very poor quality... It looks very cheap
2.0,Earring post broken so had to glue back because liked other pieces in set
2.0,"The sizing is way off. Went by measurements, sized up a size to 3-4T for my 2 yo...& It would barely even fit my 11 month old."
2.0,I can get one end to stay attached on either side of the Fitbit Versa 4. The other end just drops out of both sides of the Fitbit. Had one of these for my Versa2 and loved. Really wanted this for Versa4.
2.0,Wasn’t quite what I was looking for a little too small
2.0,Do not fit well as described
2.0,The bottoms leave a lot to be desired. The fit is weird and for a size large (when I usually wera a medium) there is not enough room.
2.0,"Bought this for use as a Halloween costume, but didn't even get out the door with it before the cheap, plastic boning in the corset gave out.  I really loved the skirt and the corset was pretty for the short time I wore it, but the boning they use just does not provide any functionality or support needed."
2.0,Do love the necklace. Can't wait to show it off to my friends.Matches my outfit perfect.<br /><br />THanks again
2.0,"These are comfortable pajamas, however after the first wash cycle the top stitching came apart at the neckline. So we sewed it back up, and continue to use this product.  Not real happy about this but we will make it work rather than pay shipping back."
2.0,Looked great but one arm has already snapped off.
2.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for, except that the strap will not stay connected to my glasses, which makes them useless for their intended purpose."
2.0,loved the dress just very big ordered a xl
2.0,Looks like one for a young child nice just way to small for a grown man
2.0,These run small. They hurt my son's head. I'm trying to return them.
2.0,For me the quality of the print was off. I hated the feel of the clothing themself as well. It felt like it would get hot and uncomfortable to play in. I would tell anyone to pass on this. I returned. I wanted to like it because my son loves godzilla but nope. Fit was as expected.
2.0,"This is a cute top, but has super cheap fabric, don't think it has one thread of cotton that it claims to have.  Runs small, but wearable.  Size L, 5'7"", 36D"
2.0,I don’t like the material. Wish it was cotton. Feels like a spandex shirt.
2.0,I loved this bag when I first got it and it used it often but within two months the straps started to come off. The stitching did not hold. It is too late to return it and I can't use it without paying to fix it which seems silly since it is so cheap. Bummer!!
2.0,"Wavy stitching, a small holl in the main lightning, details which should be parallel are not."
2.0,"Too small for my face, doesn’t cover nose"
2.0,"I got these hoping for compression type fit.  I ordered a medium since I am generally a medium in most things, they fit fairly loosly on me.  I should have got a small.  They are comfortable and I will certainly use them for the gym, i just wanted them to be tighter. My ribcage and waist are fairly small but I am a 36DDD."
2.0,"looks great, nice materials, but that ring is attached to the whole thing. it's stationary."
2.0,"Poorly constructed.  I've bought cheaper masks that were better constructed and more comfortable that this one.  Not worth the money!<br /><br />After writing earlier review (above) about my disappointment with this mask, I noticed the priced has dropped from $30 to $17!  I should be refunded the difference!"
2.0,Ordered the red but it has an orange tint.  Did not like the material at all - cheap.
2.0,"It looks cool until I try to bend anything because it fits weirdly. The fingers are long enough to cover most of my long fingers (~3 inches each) but the wrist fits too tight! For reference, my tiny wrists have a little less than a 6 inch circumference, they are 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick."
2.0,The material was kind of cheap and it was way too short I’m 5”10
2.0,Order at least 1 size up I ordered a 3x disappointed its tight on my son but was largest available he usually wears a 2x but this was really tight around the middle
2.0,"Not completely happy with this bag but it is not entirely the fault of the bag.  It is too large on the inside and not enough pockets so everything is loose and hard to find.  Would work great if you are carrying larger items like books or electronics, etc. Also the bag has a terrible smell that may go away in time but I found it hard to deal with."
2.0,They feel very comfortable at first but not great for too much walking.  They are a bit too cushy which isn't good for balance.
2.0,This is a cool case but way to big. I used it in the beginning but eventually because of the bulkiness of the case changed back to my original case.
2.0,Picture already wearing off
2.0,"legs tight, waist too large"
2.0,I didn't know the German sizes but I wanted the black dirndl. Hopefully the short version of this will fit.
2.0,"They look cute, I just had trouble shutting the hinge and they all ended up breaking before I could get it shut."
2.0,"The Pouch Broke Right When i Got It, But It Still Fits All Of My Stuff So I Guess Its Okay."
2.0,"As an avid trail runner, it’s so so important to find shoes that not only grip well, but shoes that fit well. These shoes, after months of wear are STILL giving me blisters, bad ones, too. They are the same size that I normally get, so I don’t know why it’s happening, but it’s really annoying.<br /><br />I bought these shoes because I am a severe overpronator and I had completely worn out my asr 12s. Those shoes were AMAZING and kept my ankles steady and where they needed to be. These shoes however are TERRIBLE at stablizition of the ankle. I have twisted my ankle, fallen, and limped back to my car multiple times with the 14s, and I’m so completely over it. The only reason these get even 2 stars is that they’re built well and haven’t starting breaking down, even from heavy trail use. If I could take them back, I would. I hope the next version is better."
2.0,"This is not a true wrap dress, it is a regular dress with a wrap belt. I usually wear a small and the medium fit almost a bit snug and since it doesn’t wrap, maybe size up! The fabric feels A BIT plastic-y which isn’t super noticeable but it’s not soft like I was expecting. I would return this dress if I could as I wanted a wrap dress."
2.0,This is a wonderful and soft night gown BUT it has glitter in it that leaves a Trace everywhere your child goes in it and soon your whole house is covered in it!
2.0,The shirts fit is horrible! I usually wear a small or medium  I got an extra large and the shirt tight in the arms and doesn't fit at all like the picture shows. The material is nice.
2.0,"It’s a nice swimsuit but it’s way to large in the cutout of the legs and big in the butt.  I ordered a size small, I’m 5’2” and 115 lbs."
2.0,"Soft and stretchy, but the hats I received weren't fleece lined - just standard acrylic yarn hats, and one of them was already unraveling at the top when I took them out of the bag. Also they definitely run small. I ordered 3-5T and they fit my 1 year old perfectly, and were way too tight on my 3 year old. Their heads are on the larger side, but not THAT large."
2.0,Glasses was receive defected. The arm does not touch on one side (unbalance).
2.0,I don’t think the sizing could be less accurate. I ordered a 12-18 month and it is so much larger than the 2T top we have that fits. The top is cute so we may keep it for next year but the bottoms are even bigger than the top. The picture is of the yellow “12-18 m” bottoms along with the red 12-18m that fit and a pink adult small bathing suit for size comparison. I knew it was a cheap bathing suit so I didn’t expect super high quality but am very disappointed that the sizing makes them unwearable.<br /><br />Ignore the height and weight because it wouldn’t let me select the smaller size of our toddler.
2.0,These would be cute but they don't stay in place so they are pointless. Also look very cheap.
2.0,"The text is hard to read from ANY distance, and if you have a smaller head like me, when you adjust the strap, it wrinkles the text. I might as well have just bough a black baseball cap."
2.0,First time we washed these shirts they had more wrinkles than a Chinese Shar Pei!! . I have never had shirts that wrinkled so poorly.. I wouldn’t be so upset if they didn’t say the shirts a wrinkle resistant
2.0,"The dress is nice;however, the waist band throws it off. It appears to be of another shade.<br />It could also be the bias that it is cut on...<br />Instead of adding that waist band, give some more length to the blouse and change the style"
2.0,"very pretty, but very small.. :("
2.0,the fabric frayed after some weeks of use
2.0,this was to have a play knife with it Wheres the Knife
2.0,Pretty but it would fit a size 8 and smaller
2.0,Terrible. I thought the green would be a little darker. And I swear I ordered Large size ...the tags SHOW M FOR MEDIUM and the shirts do feel like a very tight medium
2.0,I normally wear a 9 but ordered a 10....still WAY too small!  The strap didn't come up like shown in the picture and the straps pinched my foot.  I never got to wear them out.  Returned within a week.  Very disappointing product!!
2.0,These earrings are stunning and I received many compliments... the problem is that soon after I got them the clasp no longer holds so they won't stay on... huge bummer as I searched high and low for these and absolutely loved them!
2.0,Came damaged (stitching ripped out from belt loop) and smelled like someone’s heavy perfume. I didn’t choose to get a replacement because the fit from the waist down looks slumpy and baggy. Not flattering at all. Also the belt looks (is) very cheap.
2.0,"Look ok but they're not long enough (I'm 5'10&#34;)<br /><br />Also the clasps are pretty crappy, I wouldn't buy these again."
2.0,Pretty but didn't fit through my cartilage- the bar was too short.
2.0,"The bracelet is gorgeous  but unfortunately  mine arrived with the chain,that is supposed to go around your finger, broken.<br />I almost coniderd asking for a replacement  or returning the item but to took so long to arrive in the first place I just kept it."
2.0,"I only wore this shirt around the house for a little while when I first received it so I didn't wash it. However, the balls started falling off after I took it off and they keep falling off. I think at least 10 balls have fell off it and I haven't even wore it out of the house."
2.0,"Cheaply made, and way to snug (ordered an XL -- wear a medium)!"
2.0,"Liked the dress, but was very small."
2.0,It does run very small and is very see through. Its a pretty shirt. And very light. So this is for more for chicks on the thin side. if your an XL this isnt really for u. beware!
2.0,Eh. She wore it but you better be short waisted.
2.0,"Cute shirt but if you are tall, do not expect it to come even close to the length the picture shows.  It barely came down to my waist. Was hoping it was longer but no such luck.  I am 5'9&#34;."
2.0,"These boots are great for wide feet but my feet still slide forward and hit the front of the toe box. The worst part is that color is already peeling off when they have been worn only about ten times, mostly on the areas that bend. Not a big fan. Love the style but I won't be purchasing these again."
2.0,"This I wanted to really love. Great fit, material not of good quality but for running errands ok. One problem is when they were sewing the white piping they miss part of  the stitching and I think that was poor workmanship. It was very obvious. I kept it because it fit really good. I bought fabric glue to fix."
2.0,"There is no butt built into this product. When I purchase Chinese products, I add a size or two as U.S. sizes and Chinese sizes are not on the same planet. I wear a size 12 and ordered an XL. The legs fit fine, but the waist was too low, and as mentioned earlier, there was no room for a butt. However, I gave them to my husband who has not butt, and they fit fine."
2.0,"It will work since we only need it once. But not as black as pictures seem, and came scuffed up."
2.0,"I was really disappointed in this purchase. I am normally a size 14 and going by the reviews, I ordered a 4x. The bottoms fit great, but the top was way too big. This is definitely for a woman with a larger bust. I am a 38C and it was too big for me."
2.0,I bought a size up and it fits but doesn’t hold things in as I thought it would. No underwire in the bra area. I’m neutral on it. Don’t like or dislike.
2.0,I was dissapointed that they did not look like the picture. I ordered the green lens pair but actually look dark gray/black. Defiantly not the color in the picture.
2.0,dont like this at all.
2.0,The top cups fit fine but the top was too big around
2.0,This is a great costume except that the trunk is too small and it looks like a mouse costume. I would suggest trying something else.
2.0,Fit as expected but soooo see through & cheap material.. it’s a joke. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,The embroidery was beautiful however the fit of this was way too baggy. I am 4’ 11” and this fit way too baggy and long for me.
2.0,To large and fake looking---that&#34;s what I get for being cheap.
2.0,"Not good at all , too small and cheap quality"
2.0,The blue shirt stained my gee! Def wash first!
2.0,Would be an amazing pant if it wasn't several sizes too large.
2.0,"too small and the quality is very stretchy, it sticks to your skin"
2.0,"I’ve been wearing these shoes for a few weeks now for work, and though this shoe is clearly advertised as slip resistant, it’s very much not. I think a regular pair of sneakers are more slip resistant than these shoes, labeled pretty clearly underneath the shoe is “OIL&SPILL RESISTANT.” Besides this, the shoe fits pretty snug, thankfully my feet are pretty narrow, but if your feet are a little wider, you may experience discomfort. They’re very breathable and flexible out of the box, only time will tell whether or not the flexibility will degrade the material."
2.0,"It doesn’t look at all like the picture, and the sizing is pretty far off. It is warm but I’m returning it."
2.0,Too light - has no weight to it!!
2.0,Constantly pulling them up
2.0,I wanted to love this dress but just didn’t. It fit my body weirdly. I have a shorter torso so it just hit me at the wrong spot. Ended up returning it.
2.0,The elastic band across the top does not stretch much and cut off circulation for a child whose top of their bridge is higher/wider.
2.0,Broke to quickly
2.0,"This product was very disappointing. The material is SO thin and cheap, hoodie started pilling quickly, especially after washing. Runs extremely small as well. I bout it for my 13 year old and I’m glad we went a size larger than her normal Size, but even that was still in the smaller side."
2.0,It was not as flattering as I thought it would be reading reviews :(. But that’s not the problem I washed it one time and the color washed off making it look tie dye not in a cute way! I had to throw it away!
2.0,for the price...I expected better fabric. After the first wash it didn't keep its shape either.
2.0,Love the high waist on these HATE the balling that happens almost immediately. Think of how your sheet ball but times 10 and you won't even be able to wear these outside of the house after 2-3 wears. Perhaps I washed them wrong or something but definitely not a long term legging.
2.0,Slit was too high and arms were too tight
2.0,small and real cheap febric
2.0,Fabric is great quality and the dress would be easy care.  However it is very short waisted so not a good fit for long waisted individuals.
2.0,"There was a ranking chart that suggested these socks typically fit as expected yet they turned out being far too small, even for expected tightness needed in compression socks.  No time for the hassle of returning them.  I advise against this purchase or at least buy larger sizes than normal."
2.0,Cut weird!  It's shorter than ALL my other large shirts and the sleeves are REALLY short.  The shirt ends up looking awkward on guys.
2.0,It's too big ...
2.0,returned this item...size was too large for me
2.0,Didn’t like the shape
2.0,Cute and nice design but 2 sizes too small and I ordered as big as I could. So order bigger if you want to fit the right size.
2.0,There is no tie it does not wrap in any way. Pattern was cute but runs small and again it does not wrap.
2.0,Look wise color wise size wise is good But it's  Very very heavyweight
2.0,"do not buy these for what advertised. if you just want some eye coverings, fine, but don't waste money to get clear vision at night. makes everything darker."
2.0,"A waste of my money. I thought stainless steel didn't change, well not  within 2 weeks. The chain turned a piece of shabby metal. Wished I bought gold plates with silver instead"
2.0,"The material of this shirt/dress is basic t-shirt. I personally found it unattractive. It would make good lounge around the house wear, but otherwise it's just not something I could suggest. It fits rather large. The pocket idea was great, but in practice it comes our looking like you're wearing a square. Just not my thing. Overall well made, however, and the blue is true. Picture attached."
2.0,"They’re uneven.  There, I’ve said it.  If they help with fishing or sailing, I’ll be back to modify this review, otherwise my assessment that they sit unevenly on your face will stand."
2.0,Way too small.  Material is really thin.  Cute but wouldn't order another one.
2.0,"product came with a rip in the color, poor material not worth it"
2.0,Poorly made. The XXL fit my daughter who wears a size 3. I wear an XL normally this was a huge disappointment.
2.0,"Kinda disappointed that this was too small, based on the sizes I saw this item should have for (usually a size xl-Xxl) and it was too tight on the bust and waist to be wearable. It’s cute style but the material is VERY THIN AND SEE THROUGH (I bought pink) would not suggest if you are above XL"
2.0,Not at all what I wanted. The material is weird and it can’t be tumble dried. That being said it is cute (which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1). Unfortunately I already washed it so I can’t return it now...
2.0,Pretty looking - Broke within 1 week.
2.0,Very flimsy and extremely dark. Looks ok.  I returned because they were just too dark.
2.0,Very cute but very cheap. Had to resew the straps on bc they were hanging on by a thread.
2.0,"I bought these as a Christmas gift and ordered the normal foot size,  but they’re still too big.  Also, my boyfriend says says they don’t feel any different.  as in he wears around house, but his feet don’t feel any better.  But I guess it is what it is."
2.0,"When I first ordered this necklace, I was excited. I wore a bright smile, and all that came out of my mouth was an excited, &#34;I'm getting my Samulet on (date)!&#34; Finally, it came in the mail and I was so excited, God, most nights I slept with that thing. A month or two later, I went boogie boarding with friends and I got hit by a major wave. I looked down, and to my horror, I saw it hooked, yet it was only hardly clinging onto my neck. I wanted to believe it was only unhooked, but it was a tragedy. With great depression, I buried it within the hot sands of the beach, never to be seen again.<br />Although now it seemed as if it were not such a big deal, the ring-like object keeping it on the chain broke as well, so I could not have only replaced the chain. I will be sure to buy this necklace again as soon as I get some money, but surely I will not buy it from this seller. I am sorry to be writing a bad review, as I must carry on the message to future gullible fans such as myself."
2.0,The decal and color was the best
2.0,Dont like the material or how it fits.
2.0,"I've worn these pants about ten times maybe, got them four months ago, and a khaki pair as well. I really like the cut and I liked the color of these, but the build quality is fairly poor. On these the button on the leg pocket has already broken off (I guess it was riveted?), and on the khaki pair the stitching wasn't finished on the pocket from day one, I just didn't want to bother with a return since it didn't show too much.<br />So the synopsis is nice cut, poor quality."
2.0,The colors were not as bright as they are in the picture I returned it
2.0,The colours did not match the picture. They were duller. 🙄
2.0,"Way too small, it didn't fit. Wrong color sent, I chose white and received a dress with tan flowers. I ordered an XL."
2.0,"Was too small even after an exchange to a bigger size. Material is very stretchy and I think sizes are based on maximum stretch, which looks horrible.<br /><br />Both dresses felt Used."
2.0,In person it looks like a cheap plastic toy.
2.0,"I ordered these glasses just to take pictures/wear around/etc. When I got them I immediately noticed one of the one of the sides went much farther out than it should have. It appears that they were made with two different hinges that go out at two different angles. If you force it onto your ear, it will stay straight, but will sometimes shoot out, causing the glasses to fall off your face. I won't be returning these glasses because its not worth the money, but was disappointed with the product. If the hinges weren't different from one another, the glasses would be great, which why I give it two stars and not one. Maybe I just got a defective pair."
2.0,Picture totally different from product
2.0,"very cheap, I wore it twice I started to tear !!!"
2.0,"I ordered 2 tanks in the same size, the spaghetti strap one fit fine but this one was really oversize & got sent back."
2.0,"The sweater is very cute and soft, however it is very small. I’d order a size bigger"
2.0,The medals on necklace and earrings are totally different
2.0,This mask fits nothing like the photo of it being worn appears. I am unhappy with this purchase.
2.0,"Its like a raincoat shaped like a shirt. smells like a plastic raincoat. Feels like a plastic raincoat.  Hot as F#$% like a plastic raincoat. Wore it once, no air moved thru it at all<br /> It was like I was wrapped in cellophane.  If I ever need to needlessly sweat it out , now I can"
2.0,Not great lenses.
2.0,I purchased this for my daughter for a present it ran too small. She wears a 2x in womens and it was more like a large.
2.0,"It is a good idea and I will still use the hat, but the shield itself is too thin and wavy so your vision is distorted and I can't tolerate that.  Kept for the hat."
2.0,"After purchasing the long sleeved A Line dress by Honey Vanilla and LOVING it, we purchased this dress in a floral print for Easter - believing it would be the same. My SPD daughter is EXTREMELY sensitive to seams in clothing. The long sleeved trapeze dress had none. It was perfect! THIS dress has vertical seams every couple of inches ALL THE WAY AROUND the dress. My daughter couldn't bear to wear it for more than a few seconds.<br /><br />Please, please please offer the trapeze dress in prints and patterns, 3/4, short sleeved and sleeveless. KEEP the pockets (a big selling point for my girl). And please offer maxi dresses without seams. We love your seamless dresses!"
2.0,"This ring does NOT look as advertised.  The pictures make it look like a cute little ring that a grown-up could wear and it is advertised as being excellent quality and workmanship.  This literally looks just like the ring I got in 4th grade from the boy who proposed to me with a ring he got from Claire's.  I did not expect it to be dripping in diamonds as .031 carat is not much, but it looks like they spread some glue around the heart part and hoped the diamonds would stick on.  I think my expectations were a little higher because the company took the time to list the clarity, color and size of diamonds as well as to brag about conflict free diamonds.  I expected this little ring to look as cute as it does in the picture.  I imagine my 9 year old niece would really like this ring, but it is highly doubtful an adult will find this ""perfect for Daily Wear, Anniversaries, Weddings, Engagements, Parties"" etc.  I do not recommend this item and I do recommend the company ditch the barely there diamonds and step up the quality of their craftsmanship.  This could have been a cute ring."
2.0,the second time wore the a seam came loose at the crotch. The sewing quality is poor not the material or the fit.
2.0,fell apart within 2-3 months
2.0,Very cheeky bikini bottoms. Runs very small. Could be fun for a woman trying to show off their curves!
2.0,I love this but the fringe on the bottom pulls right out and is all uneven. If the fringe was attached better I would have given 5 stars and would probably wear it all the time.
2.0,This necklace is really pretty but does not rest on your neck properly.  It rides up and does not look good.  I have not worn it.
2.0,I fell in love with the look of these jeans and bought 8 pairs all at once without really getting to know how they fit. Its so hard to find low rise jeans these days so I got 8 pairs. Man what a mistake. These jeans look great for about an hour tops! Then you are swimming in two-sizes-too-big fabric. Must be something in the fabric! I would order a size down -but the waistline will probably be too tight! its a catch 22. So now Im stuck with them all because it was my fault for buying them all. Yes all 8 pairs stretch out upon wearing. Ive never had any jeans that stretch out so much.
2.0,Super cute but the design is almost fine in less than 2 months of wear.
2.0,"one of the gloves only lasted a week, im not sure if it was defective but the zipper broke iff"
2.0,"It looks cute, but the quality is poor...makes a swooshing sound when you walk"
2.0,Not what I was hoping for
2.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt, but I just don't think it's made for someone like me. I'm a small person, around 5'4 with a small build, no chest, etc. This shirt hung strangely on my shoulders and the flowy middle part shrunk a bit after washing. The back is very interesting though."
2.0,It did say women's but I gave them to my 6 year old. Maybe if you are under 100 pounds they fit.
2.0,Lace pulled from tank after 1 wear.
2.0,"I don't like the purse I contacted the seller as well as Amazon, I was not able to return it."
2.0,"I wanted to give this as a gift, but was very disappointed - much too small. I am returning them. They are good enough for a young person , NOT for a grown one."
2.0,"Good quality but too tall for most slip on boat shoes, moccasins or sneakers. The sock shows on the front of foot, the sides and back. Bummed as I cannot use them. Good quality though just don't expect to wear them with Sperry's type boat shoes, Merrel type clogs or slip ons or sketchers type short tennis shoes (like Blowfish or vans flat short tennies)"
2.0,The fabric is more like a long sleeve shirt than a sweatshirt/pullover. It's also on the shorter end. The design does look like the pictures.
2.0,Cup size too large and band too small
2.0,"These are soft and good for lounging but I would not call them a legging.  They run big and the material stretches a lot.  5'2"" 140 and I ordered a medium.  Length is good for me but probably not for someone who is tall."
2.0,It's very pretty but it doesn't connect to the fit bit properly - it falls off all the time!
2.0,"The neck wear is OK, but the box in which it arrived, has areas of mold on both sides.  It came sealed well, in an outside Amazon wrapper with no problem.  But I can't wrap thus box!"
2.0,"I wanted this to work..but I'm 5'9"" and it is way too short for my torso."
2.0,"I haven't worn them as yet, but tried them on, they fit ok, but I'm not sure I am keeping them. The foot part fells like it's made of cardboard under the suede."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:db4ce93c982a5f42116b8e09cbb63a0f]] It looks like a child made these shoes. There are a lot of imperfections like someone rushed through it. The letters are painted over blue and the blue paint is streaky and not even. The bumble bee has excess rubber on it like it wasnt trimmed when it came out of the mold. I bought this a size up for daughter and it fits like her regular size. If it wasnt intended to be used as house shoes I would return them.
2.0,"These are soft.. and that's the best thing I can say about them.<br /><br />Picked up a Medium, but they are a bit flopping/loose in the leg, so they seem more like a large. Don't bother trying to fit them under pants that even remotely fit, otherwise you'll be hiking them to parts better left alone.<br /><br />They retain a TON of moisture, so these are not worth a trip to the gym.<br /><br />And after only one wash cycle, the rubber waistbands were already flipped and twisting in the wrong direction.<br /><br />So.. why 2 stars and not 1? Because they are comfy. If you refrain from wearing them as you would wear normal boxers, that is - out of the house - and instead use them for lounging around in a robe or when it's time for bed, you won't be disappointed."
2.0,Sticky leather. Had to hang in my garage for days for the exterior stink to dissipate. Going to try foot powder trick on interior of bag because that still stinks. Ew.
2.0,Product broke before I was able to wear it. Colors were nice.
2.0,"Extremely thin; in fact they are so sheer that you can actually see through them when they're on: see attached photo. I suppose this can be a positive thing if you're looking for something to wear in warmer weather. I've only work them once but obviously have to question their durability, for the 20 bucks I paid I expected something better.<br />Also the left and right stocking are identical and the amount of pressure seemed even (no extra support near ankle or heels, etc like other brands provide). Overall disappointed and should have brought another pair of the brand I'm already familiar with.<br />I did however at least like the design, which is why I bought them in the first place."
2.0,The quality is poor. If your handy stitch the ends really well.  Grandson lives the picture.....
2.0,"So seriously I could have bought a little stick and the clip from a craft store and made this myself. While it does do the trick, it is literally a cheap wood stick with a clip at the top. Save your money and make one yourself."
2.0,"Tamaño pequeño, no cumple con las medidas, mandaron lo.que lea dio la gana, no enviaron lo que pedimos, pedimos tamaño 16 mandaron tamaño 12 o sea no cumplieron con la calidad que da amazon, si se.pide algo y no hay preguntar antes de despachar, ya es la 2 vez que nos pasa"
2.0,"Adequate, but as with anything made for kids, it needs to be durable. One did not survive half a summer at our house. I tried one pair the other day and it is very difficult to see out of the cheap plastic lenses. Can't recommend."
2.0,Glasses arrived with one of the nose pieces missing.  Glasses run small.
2.0,"I bought this very same dress in gray, same manufacturer but it shows out of stock so I'm reviewing it here with the same rating.<br />The cut of this dress is professional and suitable for a business setting. The fabric is a poly blend and thick. Nice hidden zipper in back. Cheap looking buttons on front and each sleeve. Self tie belt does nothing for the look, imo. But I've never seen sizing that is so off. I wear XL /16 in dresses and slacks, occasionally a large. I am very curvy, 5'8"",42D, and broader shoulders, average torso length. Going by the reviews, I sized up to XXL thinking it would be a little loose. Wrong. The dress is still a little tight in the hip. I can't wear it without shaping garments which in the summer won't work. It's cut ridiculously small. Arrived very wrinkled as well.<br />I got it at a good price so might keep it. I'm undecided if it's worth the hassle to return."
2.0,"I bought this in the rose/magenta, so that's the hat I'm reviewing, This hat is well made, and the color and floral pattern look like they do in the picture.  The problem is the shape, which looks NOTHING like the picture.  This is just a regular hat with a four-inch circular brim; the cut of the brim - of equal dimension the whole way around - makes it impossible to wear the brim turned down at a slope like is shown in the picture.  It's a cute hat, but just not cut as shown in the photo.  I'll keep it, but only to wear in the yard, not in public."
2.0,"I typically wear a size small band, and this is just a little bit too large for my wrist. I don't wear it because of this. The color is nice."
2.0,This material collects dryer lint like crazy and it balls up.
2.0,I didn’t like the Material... Felt like a T-shirt you get at the swap meet
2.0,"I would love it if it fit, I wear a 1x or 2x , but I brought a 3x n it’s very small"
2.0,The dress runs large and is made of costume type material. I ordered black but it looks more like a navy color. It was cheap so I figured I would try it out but I won’t be wearing it.
2.0,The color started to rub on my hand and created an itch
2.0,Looks good for the costume but it arrived with a broken clasp
2.0,This product would be nice if the material was a little thicker so it didn't just feel like I wasn't wearing a shirt at all!<br />Very soft though.
2.0,"The item looks nice but is very small.  I normally wear a size 8 pant, and these leggings were too small for me.  Also very low rise, which is not a style I like."
2.0,There is a huge seem right down the back.  So not worth the money.
2.0,I didn’t like the fit. But returned because no fur lining!
2.0,I ordered XXL and it did not fit.
2.0,"Fit was perfect and light weight!  However, after having them on for about 30 minutes, one shoe stopped working and it's not rechargeable."
2.0,"I tried to contact the seller to see if I could make this larger with no success.  I have a 7 3/4 hat size and this hat is really tight to small on my head.  I adjusted it to as big as it will go but still small.  The hat seems to be built very good, its what I was looking for keeping the sun off my ears, but if you have a small head it would be perfect for you."
2.0,"Im thinking i may have to cut a slit in the back as it is so darn tight i cannot get it over my head and i dont have a big head.. I think it would be good for a kid... its that small .. I gave it 2 stars because I loved the artwork, but I wish I did not buy it"
2.0,"I have to say that I'm disappointed with these briefs.  Just putting them on for the first time today, the design isn't the square cut as pictured in the photo.  Secondly, and I admit to some fault in this for not reading the description well enough, they don't have any opening in the front.  How is a guy supposed to relieve himself at a urinal wearing briefs with no fly?  I guess these were made for wearing on special occasions and not everyday use.  I won't buy these again."
2.0,over time the bird started get tarnished.
2.0,"The first impression - made well, soft and comfortable, look like in the description (photo) and positive feedback, the whole purchase was pleased. Size is the same, not enough halves, but not critical, for a wide foot is good. Who makes them is an absolute mystery. However, a week passed. The eyelets, as it turned out, were made poorly (after 3 days the lining began to come out from under the rings in a circle), in places the unevenness of the metal is torn off by shoelaces. In the ankle, the shoe does not hold the shape and the sack starts to sink down sideways. In the cold (up to -5) the material of the shoe is dyed, a white band appears on the fold of the foot (there material can crack). Maybe one season is enough."
2.0,"I'm a mail lady in Texas and was looking for something to help me keep the sun off my arms while maintaining some sense of cool out in the heat so I bought these. While they did help me stay a bit cooler, they are not very good at blocking the sun. I really hoped they'd do a better job. Unfortunately, all they did was create yet another fantastic postal worker tan line."
2.0,Material showed every curve and lump.  Just not for me.
2.0,"The belt was easy to cut to desired length. It is very convenient to have a finely adjustable belt. The belt seems to be of a good material.<br />Update on 6/24/2021: The belt was great new, then gradually it started to crack and fall apart. Product is not durable."
2.0,The dress did not look the same as the photo. The quality was poor I needed it to wear to a graduation.
2.0,Beautiful but the dress was about a size smaller than i expected
2.0,Misleading advertising
2.0,It didn't fit my ear.  Fits well on smaller ears
2.0,I really  didn't like the way they fit. I was hoping they would be a nicer fabric
2.0,"The ones I received look nothing like the ones in the picture. Very flat, very light, not really 3-D like I was expecting, and the detail is nothing near comparable to the quality I was expecting from the photos. Pretty disappointed, overall."
2.0,"These look fantastic however, the silicone eye cushion entirely separated from the lens so water just seeps in. So much for goggles!!"
2.0,No place to hold a water flask on the outside
2.0,The rubber bracelets smell terrible and the pins were cheap and very small.
2.0,These are hard to get on the glasses arms. My son wouldn’t wear them because of that.
2.0,"Returned it last week & I'm still waiting for my refund. The opening for the arms looks like someone just made a hole. I ordered a size down but still fit big. Bc I have a chest it made me look bigger than I am. Absolutely no shape, unflattering. I'm thinking this is more for a taller thin person, like the model."
2.0,"Cute fabric, not functional design for a small laptop or tablet that is being transported frequently."
2.0,Just need a long skirt for a single event. This will do
2.0,These pants I had purchases to use while attending the academy and then for use after for range days and other times normal uniform wasn't required. I am currently about 5'5 and 115lbs. I had ordered in a size 4 as the customer service rep suggested that size for me. The pants were a little snug around my thigh and to big in the waist. Had I ordered a smaller size the legs would have been too tight. The waist is low rise and not practical to wear with a duty gun belt. Very bummed these didn't work out.
2.0,Very cute dress but was just too small fit for me.
2.0,You get what u pay for. The material is not all that great.. Very see thru and the neck line folds on the front dont really look appealing. But i guess for the price its alright. would i buy again? No.
2.0,The tutu fell apart in the washer and the onesie is pretty cheap looking
2.0,I loved it until I saw the bottom hem line was totally blotched. totally uneven... sad because the material feels nice especially for the price! :(
2.0,"Came scuffed noticably ok the side. Especially obvious because we got the shiny pink shoes.<br /><br />Perhaps a return item that they reboxed? Or damaged/defective? Sad because this was supposed to be the big gift for our 6 year old for Christmas, and we had to return."
2.0,Looks and feels very cheap. You get what you pay for on this one.
2.0,It didn’t do anything for me but I do have a small chest area. However the delivery service was great. This product just didn’t work for me.
2.0,Way too long. Like Capri pants. Have to hem them if I want to wear them
2.0,"I love the pattern, but the sizing is not accurate. I should have sent it back, but I'm horrible at returns. It's very tight, but I admit I'm curvy. In most skirts an extra large fits just fine though. I do like the length."
2.0,Looks very nice off the head but appears too large when being worn and size size runs small.
2.0,I am a pretty small person but the item was too small girth wise. Also it was super high height wise. I am about 5'3. It goes partially up the breasts. The item was also in bad packaging and was obviously poorly made
2.0,This lasted for a couple of weeks or so before it broke in half.
2.0,Too small will throw away.
2.0,"Too much strap from the bra to the neckpiece with no way to adjust makes for an awkward look.  I’m 5’7, so it might be ideal for a taller wearer."
2.0,I'm returning the shoes  because the description said they were orange in color. I wanted orange shoes but received yellow & blue combination. Also the top and back straps are not connected which makes the shoes very difficult to put on. I would not recommend to anyone
2.0,"I'm usually a small but given the lack of stretch in this particular material, I went a size up because I thought it was a gorgeous dress- apparently, wherever this is made, they don't have women who've had a breast augmentation- I couldn't even button this up it. It would have been comical if I wasn't so irritated. For the record- I'm a 36 C, not exactly Dolly Parton, and given I'm already petite- a medium was already a little too big every where but the boobs. Sorry, but the maker of this dress deserves 2 stars for assuming all girls are both flat and narrow in the chest."
2.0,"We bought this for our 3 year old for our trip to Disneyland. When the dress arrived, there was a hole in the front where the bow meets the skirt - something I didn't see until arriving in the park (Murphy's Law at work). My daughter had already fallen in love with the idea of being Minnie for the day, so we didn't take it off to return it. From one day of light wear, the hole in the front got bigger and the back part of the skirt came unraveled.<br /><br />I know it's not a $80 dress like the ones sold in the park, but I would have hoped it would have lasted for more than a day..<br /><br />One star for quality, but I'll give it two since my daughter loves wearing it (even though it's falling apart)..."
2.0,"I liked the skin of the fabric and the stretch of it. I disiked how tight they were and that it looked like a pair of tights or basic joggins.<br /> There just wasn't enough structure there for me to feel confidant for an office. The pant would have worked great for waiting tables I think.<br />  I also did not like that there wasn't much room for the butt. Come on, if I'm wearing this size logic would say I've got a butt. Lol"
2.0,"I received the pajama today, and I don't like it. The material seems cheap, it doesn't touch soft or cool, just a wired touch feeling. Not recommend."
2.0,"I purchased the black cardigan with green bats in a 2xl based off the sizing chart. I am 5'4"", 178lbs, and typically buy an XL top. This cardigan is way too large and oddly shaped. The seam at the neck lays poorly and is curved in a way that makes the cardigan flop open and since the interior is white, it looks odd in contrast to the dark exterior. It is also a cheap polyester that is almost shiny. I will definitely be returning it."
2.0,not good Quality
2.0,"For reference my measurements are 39"" 30"" 46"". Although the chest and hip/butt area fit, it still looks very odd. Not a great design for bottom heavy, short, curvy bodies. The waist is huge for me. The dress kinda looks like a burlap bag and the material/pattern is very matronly and cheap looking (very different than what it looks like on the model)."
2.0,"Based on the reviews I really thought these leggings were going to be great, but I wore them once before they stretched out to the point that I had to continually pull them up. It’s a shame because I really liked them at first.<br /><br />I am 5’6, 140lbs, athletic build. I have a muscular butt and legs with a small waist. The first time I wore these I didn’t have to pull them up but after that I definitely did. The waist of these leggings is now just too loose on me and they won’t stay up during highly dynamic exercises. I do a lot of HIIT training and having to pull leggings up is a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />They’re also almost too high waisted. No, they are too high. The waistband literally covers my two bottom ribs. It practically touches my sports bra. I like high waisted, but not that much."
2.0,Not my favorite charm from this company.  I think the fact that it's set north/south on a braclet.
2.0,"Its a foam painted gold.  The pin back doesn't line up straight and its very bulky, not very realistic."
2.0,"After washing and line drying this item, a small hole appeared in the fabric."
2.0,"Fit is good, but it smells after a week. It’s not breathable and you can’t wash it. Maybe better for winter."
2.0,"Watch face, in fact, entire watch is much to small.  Barely makes it around my wrist."
2.0,Meh. Just didn't fit right. I bought a larger size and it still felt like it wasn't proportioned correctly.
2.0,"Very thin, can actually feel when your breathing and It feels like its only 1 layer, very cute though"
2.0,"The colors are very vibrant but the opening for your leg is very small, I ended up having to snip the elastic band to get it halfway up my calf, kind of ridiculous. Not at all what the picture showed"
2.0,Sized up to large normally wear womens 6p
2.0,Love the bling but gets caught on everything!
2.0,Purchased as a Christmas gift with not enough time to return / exchange so was disappointed to find a duplicate of one of the 4 different designs pictured. Meaning there’s was only 3 different designs and one the same as one of the other designs. Unfortunately the one I was really excited to give was the one that was not in the package. Was not a huge fan of 2 of the others and she only wears one out of the 4 due to this inconvenience.
2.0,There hard to put on keep folding over. I won’t buy these again
2.0,"These are very cute and fit a little snug in the booty, but the white fabric was so sheer that you could not only see panty lines but also the color and any pattern underneath! If you’re wearing over a swimsuit at the beach, that would be no problem, but I sent them back because I wanted something to wear out too."
2.0,The fabric looks like cotton in the picture...but it's not.  It's this silky kind of shiny material.  It would not be cool in the summer....no breathability. Also I wear a size 12...which I ordered ..L.  and I swam in it.  It was huge on me. I returned it.  And I got charged a 2.99 return fee...no idea why.  Very disgruntled.
2.0,Its almost like the mask was made upside down. It hangs past my chin.. where the linkin park print is..under my chin..  the print itself is also off center
2.0,Low quality.  You get what you pay for.  Order one size larger.  My husband's ripped after a couple of wears.
2.0,"Our Broncos boy loves them. He says they are very soft inside.<br /><br />Update on 7/5/2017. After my son has worn these occasionally for the last 6 months, he has a hole in the toe.  He's worn these no more/less than his other socks which have fared better.  In addition,  he hasn't worn these camping or hiking with his other, regular socks.<br /><br />Lastly, they frayed a bit.  I'm going to have to find another brand. for replacements."
2.0,Photo on the apron was blurry.
2.0,Way too small!!! I bought a 14 usually a 12. Has to return them
2.0,Cute! But cheaply made thin material and did not come with headbans as stated it supposed to be a 3pc!!
2.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and typically wear a 10-12, depending on sizing.  I ordered an XL hoping that it would hang well and not be too tight.  In terms of fitting in circumference, it was great.  I'm giving it two stars instead of one because of this.  However, the torso of this jumpsuit was incredibly short, which caused the crotch to pull up in a really unattractive way.  The pant legs grazed the floor, but if you intend to wear heels with this jumpsuit I wouldn't order unless you're under 5'4&#34;.<br /><br />It's also worth mentioning that the colors are much more vibrant than pictured.  The orange in the photos seems almost like a burnt orange...in reality it is bright Halloween orange.  The blues are quite bright as well.  Looks like a bad version of a 70's print."
2.0,Outstanding product. Only problem is that I received the blue/ yellow sunglasses instead of orange/ white.
2.0,It does not work with fanny pack to extend. Hoping to find one that does.
2.0,"I sent this back because it seems to fit in a weird way. On me the shoulders and chest area are huge, and the bottom part is tight."
2.0,Pretty bummed the decal came half peeling off...guess you get why you pay for but the delivery time was sorry and it fits well so it is what it is
2.0,"Too flimsy very disappointed, fabric was very cheap feeling.  The buttons are large cloth covered and unattractive. I would not buy this again. Will probably give it to my daughter who is a size 6."
2.0,I order this for my wife but sha was disapointment because the quality was so thiny.<br /><br />Yo ordene estas medias para mi esposa pero ella esta muy decepcionada de la calidad tan delgada del producto.
2.0,"The concept for this shirt is cool, but the t-shirt itself is cheap--not a great fit."
2.0,fall apart in the washer or dryer. all but one
2.0,These shoes were too small even though I wear a 9.5 in other Sperry styles.
2.0,Bought for motorcycling. Not great. Hands get cold after 10mins. at 40 degrees.<br />More of a general purpose outdoor glove.
2.0,Something about the fit was off. Sizing seemed fine but I couldn’t tell what was the back and what was the front and after trying both ways the fit still just didn’t seem right. I ended up returning it.
2.0,"Beautiful color. I was looking for a dress this color because I think it is so pretty but it just ended up washing me out. The really high neckline was way tooooo high for me and I tend to like things a bit more conservation, too! The ruffle at the bottom was just too overpowering on my small 5’1” frame. Overall just not flattering."
2.0,"I like this skirts it just runs small. I ordered a large, as I do all my skirts, but it was a little snug around my backside. I got a large. I weigh about 140-145."
2.0,"Ordered this in my size, 7,but it was a little too big so I ordered it again in size 6. They mailed me a size 9. At this point I am giving up and just returning it."
2.0,Legs were too short and material was really cheap like a cotton sheet. It got very wrinkly and had to return. I’m 5’6 and bought a large because I have big boobs but it was a bad cut all over.
2.0,Not at all what I expected. It did have the pockets.
2.0,Some of the pearls are not even attached to the earring...<br />It’s not glued enough
2.0,Nice ideal not a good product for areas that have to wear uniforms or welding areas
2.0,"The dress is really big.. I wear xl and I'm 5""6.5 186 lbs I ordered a xl it's like a 3x the back is so long and wornout, thin material, and shorter/loose in the front.. I wear a size 38 C cup but the cups were absolutely huge like for DDs the material doesn't stretch, but only under the chest where it has lace which is good.. the dress is see through... the dress is beautiful in pictures, but I don't know what happened.. perhaps I received a defective one but I really don't think so 😕<br />material= sheet like material"
2.0,Does not have a cover or see through top. It wasn't mentioned in the product description. So all the rings can fit but have to dust them off once in a while. Not happy at all.
2.0,QUALITY IS POOR
2.0,"If one does not mind losing about six to seven minutes every 12 hours, this is about what one should expect for ~$5.00. I &quot;charged&quot; the watch before wearing and noted it losing time. I thought that I might have charged it insufficiently, but the problem persisted. I think that I might give the watch to a young grandson who cannot tell time but might like the idea of wearing a watch."
2.0,"Ordered this hat for my husband and he didn't like it. It's a nice looking hat but it is very flimsy and overall kind of weak to be wearing.  His words, &#34;too weak to have such a prestigious logo on it&#34;<br /><br />hopefully this helps with others ordering"
2.0,"Ordered this based on other buyer’s positive reviews. I know it’s a $20 dress, but I was expecting the quality to be far better. It’s a lightweight material (semi sheer) and the clasps are poorly constructed. I wanted to love this but decided to return it"
2.0,No me gusto mug escotado la tela no muy buena se hace fe al lavarla
2.0,"hated the fabric and shape, have to buy the $60 original"
2.0,It's a cute top with nice material but unfortunately I am bigger in the bust so I cannot wear it it's too tight where the cross strings come out 🙁
2.0,"Product description says &#34;one size fits most&#34; - this is definitely NOT true. They might fit an 8 year old. The width of my foot was too much not to mention they are not long enough by far (if I could even get my foot in to test it). ALSO there is definitely a &#34;heel&#34; for them, so they are NOT a &#34;one size fits most&#34; which implies it adapts to each foot."
2.0,"Weight-160lbs Height- 5’8 Bust- 36D<br />Purchased a L. I usually purchase a medium or large. The large is loose, which okay but with the open arm holes the top makes me look 20lbs heavier. The material is thinner and clingy."
2.0,"It was alright, band could of been bigger or whatnot"
2.0,"Looks and fits very well, but the metal clamp makes an impression on the leather and slides off after a few uses and is not fixable. If they fixed the design this belt would be 5 stars."
2.0,These are way too small for an adult face. I will be giving them to my little cousin.
2.0,"Very cute, but extremely small."
2.0,Runs small and you can see through the blue fabric.
2.0,Style not made for me.
2.0,"This is a child's size, not men's as described. I wear 21.5&#34; and this was way too small for me."
2.0,The letters on my daughters flip flops starting peeling a few weeks after wearing them. I was disappointed in that.
2.0,Didnt fit right around neck. Bunched and hunched.
2.0,I got a size bigger than what I usually wear and it's still too small....
2.0,don't like material.  its not cotton and not forgiving at all
2.0,"The fabric is very nice, color is a little off, but for some reason, 2 inches long is sew shut. Since it is knitted, if I cut it, it will fall apart."
2.0,Didn't look as classy and nice as the picture. The front of the shoe has a pointy appearance rather than a square appearance and shoe seemed flimsy.
2.0,"Not true to size, it runs very small on the body and large on top, poor quality. :-(  very disappointed<br /><br />no way to really describe the fit, but, I think the best way to is, unless you have a large chest and small waist. I would not by this."
2.0,"Love the style and the fact that they're leather...unfortunately, the platform sole is very stiff and not padded at all, meaning the straps are where all the &#34;give&#34; and movement need to happen as you walk. I see nothing but blisters in my future with these, so they're going back."
2.0,"Sharp looking, but metal doesn't hold shape."
2.0,Reel fell apart in less than a month..cheap garbage
2.0,The mirror finish on the lenses have this warped look that makes them look like cheap wobbley movie theater glasses even though the lenses are as hard as glass. it kind of defeats the porpose of using a higher grade material if its just gonna make it look cheap anyways
2.0,"I bought these to use as facemasks due to the pandemic and I was really looking forward to the rainbow skeleton one, it was one of the main reason I bought this set. Well the sizing on the skeleton vs your face is way off, it is WAY too big. Also, the print on the skeleton is really blurry, but other parts like the rainbow at the bottom are very crisp. It looks really bad. It looks like someone took the skeleton image and increased the size too much and added the rainbow and kept it at the same size."
2.0,I ordered an XL and it didnt fit well. The top was short and very narrow.
2.0,Cute shirt but arms to small and bust area too big.
2.0,very see through. It is not a dress. definitely need to wear a slip under.
2.0,"This dress is advertised as100% cotton, even the tag in the dress says 100% cotton. No way, feels like a nylon or some kind of synthetic.  Not what I expected but it is still cute and fits well."
2.0,"Too expensive for the quality. I was looking for a structured purse large enough to carry a tablet and strong enough to sit upright on its own. I was also looking for quality materials and willing to pay for them.<br />Problem 1: This bag is big enough for the iPad, but it's weight makes the bag fall over.<br />Problem 2: After using this bag for four months, the lining on the handles is peeling off. The internal zipper is low quality (plastic teeth). The outer zipper catches easily. All compartment lining is pretty cheap material, as well. The outside looks like quality but once you start using it you learn that this bag will certainly not last the years that it should at this price point,<br />Problem 3: Because the internal storage (zipper and an open pocket) are both on the side of the bag that the external zipper is also on, one side of the bag is much heavier than the other if you are storing things (the very purpose of the bag). This makes the bag fall over. My bag sagged that way and never returned to the way it was at first, even after I removed all my things from the compartments and only used the center.<br />Good thing 1: The bag is gorgeous! Lots of compliments."
2.0,La blusa es bonita pero corre grande. La compré en XS y pensé que el cordón ayudaría a entallar pero no fue así. Ya había comprado otras blusas de Allegra pero con esta no fue tan bien.
2.0,"I'm a very tiny person (like 90 lbs at 5' 4"") so I ordered a small and it is unbelievably small to the point I could barely breathe. It was a struggle to get it back off. The material was okay, not wonderful but not terrible. It didn't go as high up as the picture shows either which was a disappointment. Unfortunately I waited to try it on after the return period had ended so now I'm stuck with it"
2.0,This shirt looks great but is made of the thinnest fabric. Putting my head through the neck hole nearly ripped the material apart as seams broke. The arms were the same. Cheap cheap shirt.
2.0,"This cover's zipper was broken when I took it out of the package. Sent it back without any problem, but there were not any more in stock."
2.0,Turns your fingers black...
2.0,"I love the look of these sunglasses and they seem to block the bad rays.  I bought two of them and within a month or so of regular use, each pair developed a problem--with one, one of the nose rests fell off the bridge and on the other, the rubber end fell off one of the temples.  Hopefully between the two, I will be able to make one good pair.  Hope it lasts!"
2.0,I was not impressed.  The hat didn't fit my head. The fabric was flimsy. Returned it.
2.0,Hat was fine. The strings were unraveled. Looks like crap.
2.0,Not a good idea whatsoever if you are a larger busted woman!!! The bottom strap that goes around your body is the thinnest smallest elastic strip.
2.0,"Fabric is comfortable, however you can see the bra through the shirt. It also does not cover the chest area very well and slides up your chest area so I am consistently having to pull it down then adjust it around my bra. Not one of my favorite buys"
2.0,Very pretty brooch but it arrived broken.
2.0,I ordered the suggested size and you can see my belly button through this.  I think it would be a great dress if I had gotten the correct size.
2.0,Cheap and very small.
2.0,These sunglasses are mainly just for looks. Nice looking but made cheap. You get what you pay for basicly.
2.0,"Pic is deceiving, and there isn't a boy outfit available even if u wanted one."
2.0,"They look cool, but the threaded part of the pistol stripped out the first time I tried put them in."
2.0,"I ordered my size 13 and they were way too large. Cant walk in them, can only wear them sitting down."
2.0,I am 175 lbs 40 inch bust and I should have gotten an XL.  The material is super itchy.
2.0,"As amazed as I was at the concept of bamboo socks, the style and cut made these too uncomfortable to wear for a long period. The material is smooth, silky, and thin but cushioned- Dress casual cushioned is a perfect description. However, these socks are also cut very narrowly, and there is strong elastic in the socks, making them dig into your legs relatively quickly after putting them on. (I have average sized legs and have never had a problem with socks fitting berfore.) I wanted to love these socks, but they just weren't for me."
2.0,I got the dress for a wedding this weekend and I really like it but the zipper in the back won't go down and there are pieces of the fabric sticking out of the dress.
2.0,Very pretty but I haven't been able to wear it because the clasp on the cheap chain that is used won't open. I'd like to switch it out but I can't even do that.
2.0,The feel and fit of this bar is actually very nice. The issue is the zipper staying zipped. The smallest movement and the zipper comes COMPLETELY undone. I am returning because of this.
2.0,Lining tore on first use. Price too high for the quality.
2.0,Fit to big for the size I wear ..!
2.0,washed in cold water and dried at low and they shrunk at least one size!!
2.0,We were sent the wrong color and the clasps are cheap and broke within a few days.
2.0,"It's like pictured, but the material is super cheap.  I might return."
2.0,Cute. Top fit great! Bottoms we’re definitely way too huge
2.0,Ordered 2 sizes bigger and still too small.<br />Very cute othewise
2.0,Bought this product as shade for my small koi pond.  A slight wind broke the arm holding up the umbrella.  So disappointed.  Plastic parts comprise the opening/closing mechanism.  The arm snapped at this mechanism.
2.0,"Not apricot as advertised.  Definitely cream. However,  the fit is accurate and the quality as expected for the price.  Would have preferred a satiny skirt Instead of a muslin one as it tends to ride up. Overall, a nice item but completely wrong color."
2.0,This top is ok. It didn’t fit really good cause there were some bulges on the sides from the way it was sewn. It is longer than I expected. I would not buy again or recommend it.
2.0,I was disappointed in the accuracy of this product. I wouldn’t recommend it if you are trying to maintain a specific pH or acid/base level in your soil.
2.0,"The style and the fit are great, but the fabric is WAY too thin; you can see through it when you bend over and it's stretched out a bit. I'll wear them around the house, but not in public. Bummer."
2.0,"too small to get in ear.  wanted a small ring that I could sleep in, but can't get in so they are not for adults."
2.0,"Just got it today, and not happy one bulb is dim and not as bright as the other. But it seems it could work if the other light was bright."
2.0,Clasp broke on second use
2.0,"The dress I received is not the same dress as in the picture. It is long in the front, the straps are very wide, and the neck is high, and not low cut. False advertisement."
2.0,"Very soft fabric, but the sizing was way too small...."
2.0,Make sure you look at the measurements - this is a really small bag.  I gave it 2 stars because the zippers are also hard to close.
2.0,Metal came off. Turned my finger green.
2.0,It was cute but started to shred and fall apart after 2 uses
2.0,"It was cute and delivered on time, but it broke within a week."
2.0,I got mine for the nostalgia and is great watch.  Was in tip too shape and works great.  The movement comes in many shapes and sizes but the module is simple.  As always I wish it had a countdown timer.
2.0,Doesn't been well to fit arm. Uncomfortable and do not see same pain relieving effects as I did with other copper bracelets
2.0,Band broke after a week. I guess that's what I get for buying a cheap watch
2.0,It was too small and the sides flair out way too wide
2.0,Thin and crooked
2.0,"Looks good, makes the gear fit 2 pro look very nice however, it would only securely latch on one side. Perhaps my band was defective. I tried several times to get it to hold but it wouldn't lock in place. Shipping was fast. It did come with tools to take some links out. I didn't use the tools so I can't speak to the ease of re-sizing the band. I was disappointed because I think the band the watch comes with makes it look cheap."
2.0,"My 10 year old nephew took less than 24 hours to break this necklace. I imagine that an adult would have no problem keeping this in tact, but it's a little more fragile that I would have hoped."
2.0,"Very poor quality, was disappointed"
2.0,"bubbles on top layer even before wearing,"
2.0,"Although the quality of the item is good, the picture showed in Amazon is not the real one - the lents are black and I bought cause was blue in the picture... wrong ad!"
2.0,Too short. Does not completely cover blade.
2.0,"Love the hat. But it is to small for my 8 year old. In the past 3 months I have purchased 3 other kid hats (kids are in a hat phase), and this one is the smallest. It would be appropriate for my 3 year old size wise, but not the child it was intended for."
2.0,"This bracelet is cute and all, but just about impossible to connect the clasp to put it on!! A different clasp or way of connecting the two sides should be considered..VERY FRUSTRATING to try to put on!!!"
2.0,"The fabric is very cheap. The concept is great, but it's very big. Kinda disappointed."
2.0,"I loved it, but sadly it broke in less than 2 months."
2.0,This tail is very cheap. The material is very thin and flimsy. There is a seam all the way down the back of the tail and the scales do not match up at all. It is VERY noticible.
2.0,"The strap seems flimsy, not made too well. I have a smaller wrist and it would not fit me. Too bad because the price is great."
2.0,FOR A VERY VERY SMALL NECK
2.0,"I purchased one of these and literally it was completely wore out in 3 months of light use, the pockets although thick material did not hold up to the tools and they completely made their way thru, so now I have a vest with nothing but holes in it. A redesign is definitely needed. Also note I’m 5’10” 210 lbs and wear thick coats and the vest is still quite large."
2.0,The small was too big.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Cute but one month of wear and the top came unglued from the sole. Hardly any wear on the sole. Not worth the investment.
2.0,"The pants feel like cheap yoga pants, they are super long and while the pants fit the belt was like an XS  and wouldn't even tie at my waist."
2.0,I’m sure it’s in the description and I did t notice it but this thing is really small.  Looks like you are wearing a bikini bottom
2.0,It was much smaller than expected. Print and fabric very nice. I ordered XL but it fits my daughter who is a medium.
2.0,"in light of what i paid for it, i was very disappointed in the thickness of the sweatshirt.  perhaps my mistake was that i assumed that it would be thicker than it was.  it is produced by alaskans so i figured it would beefy enough to withstand cool springs and falls--not so."
2.0,"My daughter liked this pendant because the cat was cute and there was an engraving pictured on the back of the product photos posted on Amazon. She was exremely disappointed that the engraving was missing on the pendant we received. Also, the pendant was bigger than expected."
2.0,"I was expecting it to just be lace. I was not expecting support of any kind, purely decorative. That is was.<br />The disappointing part was how smal it was. Not in wideth but in length."
2.0,"I purchased XS/S and it was too small on my thighs, M/L fits perfect on my legs but loose on the waist and butt  quality is ok,  little overpriced, letter are coming off on the first try."
2.0,"A &#34;Free People&#34; rip off.<br />I bought two of these dresses..1 white, 1 black.<br />There's no way that this can be considered a true maxi dress.<br />I'm 5'3, skinny, and it hit me at about mid calf.<br />I returned both immediately."
2.0,Not true to size at all. Ordered a size 4- the pics are comparing their size 4 to New Balance size 4. Huge difference. My daughter couldn’t even get the shoe on. Will be returning.
2.0,Fabric a little cheap but functional.
2.0,"Bought two pairs, one for my boyfriend and one for me.  They're cheap plastic goggles that have been painted.  The painting job looks great a rustic, but the paint came off on our faces.  We looked like raccoons with black rings around our eyes."
2.0,Waaaay toooo dark!
2.0,"Purchased as a dress to wear to weddings for the summer, received the dress and it had no shape to it, like I was wearing a bag. The piece of material supplied that is to be tied around the waist does not stay in place, it tends to ride up immediately after you situate it. Needs little thread tabs on the sides to hold it in place. I gave the dress away. Loved the chiffon material though."
2.0,Wasn't clear that this wasn't for a 7 plus. Gave to a family member
2.0,"I originally liked this belt.  However, after about a week, the screw that holds the mechanism together came out.  I have tried to contact amazon, HIMI Official but have gotten nowhere.  I'd like to just get a replacement buckle but no one seems to care."
2.0,"I really hoped this suite would fit. The cut is kind of odd.... if you have a longer torso or are busty, this wouldn't be the suit for you. I have a slim build and long torso, and this suite was super short...and i'm only 5'3&#34;! Chest pads seemed misplaced--they were super low too. Overall, I must've received a poorly produced product."
2.0,It's short if over 5'9. Seems small....
2.0,"It works as described, but the adjustment makes for odd hand/camera grip positioning. I like the grip firm, but doing so means the cushion placement is too high and the outside bottom of my hand rubs on the strap; leading to irritation."
2.0,"After using these holders for several weeks,  the area attached to the glasses separated. The item can't be used."
2.0,"The design on the front is cute, but that’s about the only good thing I can say about this shirt. The head hole is small and my daughter struggles to get it on. The material is super cheap and thin. It is not like sweatshirt material. It also took forever to arrive."
2.0,"These run really small, and the waist is not very stretchy. I will be returning them."
2.0,For the price you pay these boots should not be scuffing after one wear - very disappointed
2.0,Order 2 sizes smaller.  A small is like a large. No tags in item to know if correct size was received.
2.0,Very thin. The mask should come with at least one filter each. Some of the stitching and words were not done correctly.
2.0,Does not lay flat on my nose.
2.0,"I got these for my 4yo to use in the pool and surrounding pavers to protect her feet. Right out of the package they are very cute, easy for her to put on, light. But, less than a week of wear they started coming apart. She has worn them at most 5 times for the span of 1 hr each; they have holes, stitching is coming apart, and the reinforcement on the toe is wearing off. DO NOT BUY THESE."
2.0,"I originally ordered an XL for this hoodie and when it showed up it fit but not to where it was a comfortable fit. So I decided to order a 2XL and I’m pretty sure they sent me the same size again and it’s the same issue. Worried that it will shrink in the wash and the quality seems cheap, so I will be returning unfortunately."
2.0,"Although you can snug the hood up with the cords, they don’t tuck neatly away.  The hood comes one size, but it’s extremely roomy.  Lots of extra fleece to tuck away.  Wish it was a little more form fitting.  It’s very warm, so that’s good."
2.0,ankle area really gapped...too large around the ankle for me  returned
2.0,I order 3 pair xl I have many all large this product need to be make for man small as hell in 5'9&quot; a normal height this thing only cover 3/4 of my arm Chinese please make product for other race not only for your seen you make your money selling to others
2.0,"Only wore these socks TWICE, before holes started in the toe area.  Fit great, easy to put on, but didn't last long."
2.0,These earrings were a whole lot smaller than I thought they would be. I was disappointed in them.
2.0,These fit okay - not quite right and the color is nowhere near the same as the Oakley Red Iridium.
2.0,Good ripp off
2.0,"Give it three weeks, it'll fall apart on ya."
2.0,Had to return due to the white yoga pants being see thru.. I will be looking for another pair that isn't see thru.
2.0,this materal was made really cheap the bottoms were small and the top was very big
2.0,"This bag came to me with a lot of scratches on the part above the clasp, looking horrible. I love the model but not a new looking product"
2.0,it didn't fit and the metal was cheap. Metal began to change color as soon as I took it out of the package. Would never purchase again!
2.0,These make everything SUPER bright. Not useful as sunglasses to shield sunlight in any way.
2.0,"These pogies are so small. I bought them for my boyfriend and there's no way he could get his hands in there.  My hands fit, but they JUST cover my palm. I do,  however like the material used to line them.  I'm allergic to neoprene, and these don't seem to irritate my hands as bad bc of the soft liner."
2.0,I bought this for a wedding and decided to send it back because it arrived with snags and the slit in the front wasn’t sewed correctly. It bunched up really weird and looked even worse on.
2.0,Cute petals but they have a very strong adhesive that caused a reaction on my skin. It hurt to remove them and then I had a rash/redness for days after. The wingslove brand is so much better
2.0,Shoes are the worst totally huge look clownish sizing totally off! Onesies was also big but not as bad as the shoes. Order down a size
2.0,"it fit great, then I washed it in cold water and it shrunk. I hang dried it scared it would shrink some more. so unsatisfied with this product.6"
2.0,Too short and ran small.
2.0,"Like the size and shape but very disappointed with leather finish. Leather is faded and worn all around bag, especially top. I assume that's why cheaper price but should have stated that up front on ad."
2.0,I bought this for a bright splash of color to wear with a black top and orange patterned maxi skirt. It looks great!!  Problem is...I’m unable to keep it on. The screw closure has come unscrewed twice today. So sad 😔. I really like the length and neon color.
2.0,"Its okay, I dislike the material"
2.0,Color faded after one wash.  Now the lace is a completely different color than the top. Not happy since I only wore it one time.
2.0,"Very small, pretty much child’s size. Ok for like maybe a costume, not for normal use."
2.0,The belt was missing
2.0,Internet shopping woes... nothing more/nothing less.
2.0,"This is NOT MAGNETIC at all, very thin, so don't be fooled into thinking it will be drawn together.  False advertising in the TITLE.  It is only a basic set of key chains.  Why do people feel the need to lie?"
2.0,"The band was intact but it came in dirty, it actually looks like worn before. I’m not wearing make up but the stains look like make up or self tanner stains. Really disappointed."
2.0,"Hips: 41”, bust: 38”, 145 lbs, 5’5”<br />Ordered a large and it was a bit too big in the bodice.<br />Stitching was coming apart around the bust. The fabric and design are beautiful. Might’ve been a fluke that the one I received was poorly stitched. I have wider hips and smaller ribs."
2.0,"I don't know how I can find a product called pajama jeans uncomfortable, but I do. The L is too tight but the XL is too big. The ""shaping"" part doesn't really do anything, it's almost like maternity pants, and the heaviness of the pant tugs on it and you constantly have to pull it up."
2.0,Absolutely gorgeous but way to heavy to actually wear.
2.0,"These socks are in no way 90% cotton. I just reread in the description, &#34;up to 90% Cotton.&#34; well these don't even come close. My Husband doesn't like as he calls them &#34;moisture wicking socks&#34; as they make his shoes smell. So if you have the same preferences, I'd look at another pair of socks. They are not poor quality they are as described. They are &#34;summer weight&#34; and thin. I'm giving them to one of my nephews, and I'm sure he'll be pleased. I'll update (if I remember) as to the wear factor."
2.0,It's hard to clip into the fitbit.
2.0,This is such a weird fit. It looks like a short Moo-moo. I threw it right in the trash. the top does not fit like the photo for bigger chested girls. The seam sits on top of your chest. It looks so bad. I don't recommend this unless you're like a size 6 or under.
2.0,I waited three weeks to receive this from China. The material is super thin and the color pink is more peach. The style is actually cute if it wasn't for the overly thin super stretchy material. I'm typically a 6/8 and a medium was gigantic on me! Was hoping for a miracle but just ended up being a dud. Maybe a smaller size and a different color would be the winning combo. At least now it's on prime so it can be returned. Such a bummer.
2.0,It looks like a child's sweather!I'm an average sized woman. And is so thin and cheaply made. I'm so upset about this. Returning it
2.0,"The band is short. When attached, I cannot squeeze my hand through the band, unlike previous bands I have owned of the same type. The only way to get it off is to completely pull the magnetic end off through the loop. Getting it back on requires fumbling with the watch to keep it on the wrist, then delicately trying to thread the magnet back through the loop. 3 hands would be useful."
2.0,Ugly!!! Lol. But it’s super soft. I just wear it around the house.
2.0,These seem sturdy enough but there is not a clear plastic cover on the front to protect the written information from getting ruined. Without protection it can get easily wet.
2.0,"one of the flags was off the earring and in the package i super glued it on, the out side looked like rust as a mother's day gift I was disappointed"
2.0,"Cute cover.  Easy off/on. But, the paper the design is printed on is very thin/flimsy & the camera opening was not cut out.  The poor quality of the paper made it difficult to cut the openings, causing the paper to tear."
2.0,Pretties and not what you would call like your regular thick cotton hoodie but Graphics were nice and of course you can
2.0,"Really wanted to love this suit, especially at that price! But it was just a huge miss for me. I am 5'9 185lbs and wear a 38C bra and 12-14 clothes. The top was tight fitting getting on and the bottom half of my boobs were sticking out the bottom of the top.<br />The bottoms were ok, but the ruching kept bunching all to one spot and wasn't very flattering."
2.0,"I really want to give this ring more stars because it is absolutely adorable. It just did not last, it broke six days after receiving. I was so bummed that it broke too because I got it to symbolize a trip that I took in May with my cousin and really loved the way it looked."
2.0,"Jacket has a pretty good and snug fit, however, the inner pockets arrived ripped as you can see in the image. Not sure if it's HH quality but I'd expect better sewing quality or better product quality."
2.0,"I was disappointed with these slippers.  I used to be able to count on &#34;Dearfoams&#34; to always fit just right, but one pair I ordered was too tight and I returned them.  The other pair that I got (and now wear) are too big, but it seems that no one else makes this style of slipper using this fabric or colors, so I kept them.<br /><br />Also, the memory foam is an enticing gimmick, but I've had several other pairs of these slippers before with the memory foam, and they ALL go flat after about two weeks of wear and provide no cushioning."
2.0,There nice but a bit wide the woman says
2.0,Not what I expected. Looks more on the cheap side.
2.0,"I couldn't get it over my head, it has no give at all."
2.0,Dont waste your money on these. fall apart  real fast.
2.0,"Color and quality are ok. Fit not so good. It's fit me well ,not small, not big,but very short. And material is kinda of rough. So it's a big NO from me.<br />I am size 16,5'7&#34;."
2.0,"Material is very thin, loose weaved, size runs way...SMALL."
2.0,"The finishing is not as good as the picture, looks like the black leaves are painted with something and the paint is scattered at some places on the rims. I am not quite happy with this."
2.0,Very flimsy and kept popping off of my phone. Not the biggest fan of it so I switched back to the old case I was using.
2.0,"Beautiful, comfortable, but because it has set straps it sits too high on my chest. I'm only 5'2&#34; tall, and 105-115 lbs. My other lace linguine bralettes fit well, but this one can't be worn. It just pulls up until it's moving over my breasts."
2.0,Good quality but definitely too small.  Gave them to my niece.  Would have been better rating if the size was more accurate.
2.0,"I received the wrong color, they are also almost silky definitely not cotton not worth the money."
2.0,the magnet came out of the white one and we had to glue it back in.
2.0,Runs super small and does not look like the picture gave it to my daughter
2.0,I ordered an XL when I normally wear M to L in hoodies. It is still too small.  Love the color.  Ended up giving it to my niece.
2.0,the cut of this dress is definitely as shown. its very tight where the upper straps are so my fianc&eacute; and I cut it up and created something more suitable and comfortable to wear. perfect beach material
2.0,way too small than the picture
2.0,"Is cute but it runs to big, sad I couldn’t wear it."
2.0,I have a 6in wrist and it fits perfectly. It's really cute and had no problem getting it on and off.<br /><br />A metal piece broke off this morning making it unwearable. It's a weak link and no way of fixing it. I would no longer recommend.
2.0,Pockets where Sewn on uneven.
2.0,Bought two Gioberti Sweaters xxl fit perfect. This sweater was recommended as an alternative and the xxl was way to small. Disappointed as the style was nice.
2.0,"This coat seemed to be good quality, but the fit was more boxy looking than in the photo. The main problem was that although the overall fit was good, the sleeves are sewn in such a way that I could not raise my arms.  I don't think another size would alleviate this problem.  I returned it."
2.0,Basically feels and looks like a bathing suit
2.0,"I bought 3 asei Men's Quick Dry Compression Tights Underwear Pants Long, but one of them had a hole at the back upper left leg. I need to return it or change it. Please, let me know. Thank you!"
2.0,"The style is perfect, but the size is a size smaller than expected."
2.0,I though I was getting a bargain and I got a below bargain for the price.  I have had $10 watches that have last longer. The two button on the side fell off in less than 24 hours. The look is fashionable but do yourself a favor save up and get a real watch.
2.0,The color go fast and broken
2.0,Not sure who is supposed to wear this as designed. Not sure a child would even be able to wear it comfortably.<br /><br />I would suggest making the straps longer or possibly adjustable so they can be fixed.<br />The design is nice and arrived on time.
2.0,"The last couple of pairs of Crocs I've ordered have not been true to size.  When I compare 9s from this year with 9s from a couple of years ago (even 1 year ago), there is a 1/2 inch difference--later styles are bigger!  Just keep in mind, maybe order down if you need a half size."
2.0,"These yoga pants are extremely soft. I was super excited about putting them on. They feel amazing against my skin. They have two extremely deep pockets that almost go down to my knee. They are a good length and I like the stitching on the side.  I liked that they were not pants length but more pedal pusher length.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fabric is a double edged sword. The soft stretchy fabric which is 80% nylon and 20% spandex does not stay up. They are very low rise. I bought the right size according to my measurements which is a large in this case. The band has no grip. There is no tummy control because the pants band will not stay up. They are completely unusable and unwearable.  I can't walk in them so moving while working out would never be possible."
2.0,After two wears this stretched out and is baggy.
2.0,"Ok so I loveee the color of this nightgown. fabric is nice and light. If your curvy size up for a more comfortable fit. I originally ordered it in a small bc I have a small top and curvy bottom. The small fit perfect, however bc of the slightly higher side it appeared to fit like a club dress and I wanted it a little looser like a slip so I returned it for the medium which fits. They thong that comes with the gown is now too big but it’s fine without them. I don’t like the fact that one side is longer than the other it’s very weird on."
2.0,I question if it is real leather.
2.0,"Very short and tight. Gave it to a friend,"
2.0,"it is very good quality, not see through at all and a comfortable fabric. however the top portion of the dress is just too wide. it would probably be better for someone with bigger breasts, the extra fabric just makes it look weird so I will be returning."
2.0,"These look really neat, but they are unbearable. There's a reason they're less than $6! Everything is RED. Greens and blues disappear, making it impossible to drive with, and they just plain HURT my eyes. TOO much red, no consideration went into making them actually wearable. You definitely get what you pay for."
2.0,"I got these cute earrings today, but when I pull the lever back to put them on, it pops off. I’ve tried fixing it but can’t get it to stay latched."
2.0,"I have a South commute in the morning and a North one in the afternoon. The sun is almost always on my left. I go nearly 30 miles each way between work and home and I was tired of sun glare getting inside my sunglasses and bouncing off the lens into my eye. I don't like wraparound shades; they get too close to my eyes and eyelashes. I looked at the reviews and got these hoping to stop that dangerous sunglare.<br /><br />They're just as bad. The side shields are attached to two pivot points so there's a line between the shield and the actual frame where nothing connects. That doesn't matter though, because in their infinite wisdom they put a series of rivet holes all along that edge anyway (for style?) that let in a series of bright dots on the inside of your sunglasses and cause a lot of distraction and annoyance while trying to drive. The little foldover flap on the bridge didn't sit flat -- it wanted to spring out to a round shape -- and pushed the glasses out just enough to 1) cause you to see the black blob on top of your nose and 2) break the point of contact the side shield has with your face (letting light in).<br /><br />I might be able to tape over the rivet holes with electrical tap, and even bridge the gap between the shield and the frame, and I can remove the flap folded over the bridge by unsnapping it... But I shouldn't have to. In fact I cannot. The side shields are not symmetrical. There is less material on the bottom half and more on the top, because of the way the human face is shaped and how the sunglasses sit, you need less where your cheekbones are and more to bridge the gap at the top corner of your eye socket. Well... When I got mine the fit was atrocious and it took me a minute to realize why light was pouring in and it was so uncomfortable digging into my cheek: My left-side shield (IMO the more important side for a driver) was actually a right-side shield that was put on the wrong side upside-down. I had two right-side shields on mine, instead of one left and one right. I took it off and confirmed this with the other side's shield. You can clearly see the shape difference on either side of the temple retainer loop.<br /><br />This makes them, essentially, terribly designed, poorly executed, and just unusable in their current state. The packaging also said mirrored but they are only tinted. That's what I ordered so no problem, but just shows the uncertain nature of the quality control on these. I took a chance and I'm sorry I did. I will be looking in to how to return these. I had to take them off halfway through my first drive home with them because going without was less distracting than actually using them.<br /><br />I was going to create my own sun shields cut out of some rubber infused materials to block the sun. I figured I'd save myself an hour and just buy some. I regret that now. I could have done it much better on my own."
2.0,"The band was super cute, and I really wanted to use it but it would not firmly attach to my Versa 3. I had to return the band because it would not stay attached to my device."
2.0,"Cute but doesn't fit right. Ordered my normal size, cups too small but the band was loose."
2.0,Must have been mismarked<br />Way too small
2.0,The photo shows a completely different pattern than what I received. I received a bland and overdone pattern of plain polka dots. The dress I thought I was getting has different size dots sporadically placed and looks nothing like what I got. Also the bust is really big even after I tightened the straps far as possible. I’m a c cup so this has not happened to me before.
2.0,"Writing on my fiance's profile. The material is thin and sheer, you can see the color of undergarments immediately! Fit was okay, just couldn't get past how sheer the fabric is. Unwearable for my wedding rehearsal. Also note that the Large front hemline was extremely short on a 5'8&#34; 180 lbs build."
2.0,Didn't want to send it back but it was too small.  When ordering you should order a size larger than what you would normally wear.
2.0,Not good for women over 45 if your derriere has dropped at all. the elastic does not keep you in.  I believe someone else had the same review.  I should have heeded it.
2.0,"Looked cute, but the wife said it was too small and donated it to Goodwill.  I wish I could have seen the look on the face of the employee that went to hang it, and the person that eventually bought it."
2.0,"When I opened the package I was relieved by the look. It appeared big enough to fit my larger chest. Getting the bra on and off was another story. This top does not have much give to it which makes putting a sports bra on a bit difficult and the fit very, very tight. Wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,"Great quality and material, however the dress went down to my knees which looked horrible"
2.0,Size restrictions.
2.0,These shoes didn't last all that long. My daughter complained of them hurting after only about 8-10 wears. They started falling apart on the inside first and now the sole is ripping away from the top of the shoe.
2.0,it wasn't as comfy as I thought a sweatshirt should be.  Looks good on the hanger
2.0,It was larger than anticipated and very clingy to the body. Didn't care for the fit at all.
2.0,"Way larger than a medium should be.  Other than that, they are nice."
2.0,"Didn't fit quite right, had to modify it to get it to work. Very thin plastic tabs that broke off after a road trip. Not sure how long it will be on the vehicle before I have to give up and put the factory grille back on."
2.0,This was the most uncomfortable sports bra I have ever tried.  I returned it.  It runs so small as well.  I am 5'5 and weigh 113 lbs with an A/B cup size and this was cutting off my circulation!  AWFUL!
2.0,"This was ridiculous. The size I got had a huge hard bra that gets in the way. I wear a large size bra anyway but it still didn't fit. Not worth returning for the cost, am trying to fix it by hand."
2.0,I thought this item was a great find but it does not fit properly. It is not worth the effort.
2.0,"Loved that it was easy to breathe through the mask. But it broke after put it on 5 times, and now doesn't sit right."
2.0,Works alright. Not planning on keeping it.  To much work to polish.  I have used better clothes.
2.0,Product seemed to be good quality but too heavy for me and I could not get them on.
2.0,"If you are average height (5’5”) or taller, these are going to be much too short. I hate to give a low rating, but the photos are misleading in this way.<br />Also, make note that you will have TO PAY THE SHIPPING COST to return the item.<br />The models in the photos must be about 5’2” or shorter, for the pants to be that long on them.<br />That said, if you ARE on the shorter side, these will likely fit you perfectly.<br />Make sure you check the inseam length on the size chart to to see if the length will work.<br />For reference, I am 5’6”, 130lbs. I ordered a size medium and the length ended a couple inches above my ankles.<br />Other than this significant issue, the pants are as advertised."
2.0,The skirt is ver full. I think it would look cute with a crenilin slip
2.0,the majority of the short is stretch but the mesh does not give at all. Run kind of small overall.
2.0,Threading is very bad and there were hardly any 14g rings. Couldn’t even open the captive balls. Besides that there was a good variety.
2.0,"I love the style of this dress and am finding it really hard to return, but will have to. It was cut unevenly and the front doesn't lie the way it is supposed to. One arm hole area is cut about a half inch longer than the other and at a bit more of a slant. If it weren't for that I woule be keeping it. It feels strange and even though only I can probably tell, it looks strange too. Positive notes: super cute lace trim detail, heavy durable fabric, and it fits my frame (5'6, 225, 42E, however this number would require taping of the girls or adhesive bra)."
2.0,Looks kind of cheap.
2.0,The shirt had no hem. Worked for what I needed.
2.0,Didn’t like the way it fit// not what I expected — sending it back for a full refund hoping with a free shipping label— waiting—
2.0,"I could barely get this over my shoulders (and they’re fairly narrow!), once it was on it was AT LEAST two sizes too small. The padding is really strange, very small circular cups that do not come out and are very noticeable when worn. I wanted to love this, the color is beautiful and the the fabric looks really luxe."
2.0,"Quick shipping, as described, fit as expected.  Very comfortable, but developed a tear in the fabric within the first month.  Material may not be very sturdy since they are so soft."
2.0,"Unfortunately the ""WATCH"" every morning the TIME is (5minutes SLOW) I bought it for my WIFE, but although she likes the view of the watch on her hand, she has to look at the TIME on the CELLPHONE and adjust it again and again and again. NOT HAPPY"
2.0,"These Arch Support Boots were very cheaply made.  No support at all, it felt  walking on a thin piece of card board.  Very disappointed.  I didn't return because I would have had to pay shipping to China. Not worth it."
2.0,Cheaply made and the bow is missing. I'm not really sure they're original UGG to be honest
2.0,"The waist line is super small fitting, but it would be really cute if it was elastic band"
2.0,The fabric felt cheap and the fit was off. I.returned it.
2.0,I thought these sunglasses were really cute and I was excited to wear them however they arrived broken. There was one of the nose supports missing so unfortunately I won't be able to use them.
2.0,"The little pins, which you have to insert, kept falling out while trying to get one side inserted, the other side was a little easier once one side is inserted. You will have to keep the bags they came in for storage, as the pins do not stay in. The design is just okay; the band is so large that only the ""OVE"" show on one end, and on the other end the adjustment piece is on top of the ""O,"" you can kind of see the rest of the word...The band with the daisies, you can't really tell that they are daisies, look like yellow splotches. The band, while adjustable is really large. I have a wrist that is approximately 6.5 inches, and at the tightest<br />adjustment my watch still moves around.  Not really worth the $6+ paid. Wouldn't order again."
2.0,I wasn’t fond of the color of the shirt that arrived. But otherwise the shirt was a cute style.
2.0,"Tarnished quickly, difficult to clean."
2.0,Not what I expected. Very thin.
2.0,"Zipper broke fairly quickly, and it bunched up in the middle/at the waist weirdly. I still have it but I was only able to wear it a few times fully zipped."
2.0,Much to large slide off my feet
2.0,"Very thin material, faded after 1st wash, the edges unravel easily."
2.0,"Didn't fit correctly so that you could get your fit bit stats, either too loose or too tight unfortunately"
2.0,Broke after 2 months... got a replacement buckle and did some unstitching... so far so good....
2.0,"Size is WAY OFF. I'm 5'8"" and large framed. I bought XL. They do not cover full fingers and the wrist doesn't come up to wrist area. Things need made to fit larger westerns."
2.0,Thought this shirt would look much better than it did. It doesn't fit anything like the picture shows. It is baggy on me and the design makes it look like the old barbers shirt. Can't recommend.
2.0,I'm actually a little disappointed. The picture makes it look much nicer. In person  the stone looks tiny & cheap! I have bought things for my daughters in the past that looked really nice & my granddaughter always wanted a special granddaughter piece of jewelry which I decided to get for her 16th bday. Would love to put a nicer stone in if possible. I do love the saying on it though!
2.0,"overall a nice gadget, gave low rating because no carabiners were included. Two were advertised."
2.0,Ok.... I got the purse because of the good reviews. I’ve only been carrying this purse for a week and it’s already tearing up.<br /><br />See the pictures!<br /><br />Now if I continue to carry it for another 2 weeks it will be worth the trash. I bought this to take to NYC. I’m not carrying it around with me like a regular purse.  Using a smaller crossbody bag.<br /><br />I’m returning this for a full refund when I get back home from my trip.<br /><br />I paid to much for it be getting torn and raggedy already.<br /><br />I only gave it 2 stars because I do like the roominess of the bag.
2.0,"The thickness of the mask was good. However, the color on this mask was not as vibrant and the folds were sewn kinda weird so the full picture of the elephant didn’t show. I ended up giving it to a friend who really likes elephants and would appreciate it regardless."
2.0,"I bought one size up since I read some of the reviews. It fits a little loose. But you can see through the shorts. They are a very thin material. I only paid $3.90 because of a coupon, so not worth it full price!"
2.0,I got these thinking they were pen lights that I could give to nurses. They didn’t work for that. The eyes lit up blue and the light was not a focused beam. But they are cute just to give as a novelty gift.
2.0,Super disappointed in this. It’s huge and  it good quality :( but it got her real quick.
2.0,it's cool but my boobs are too big would be cute for perky small boobs
2.0,"This dress is ok. I like the color and the unique style, but the fabric is terrible. It is thin and plastic-y."
2.0,"The size I got does not look like the picture, they are very different."
2.0,Looks good but if your a 26-27 inch waist these will be way too big even if you order the smalles size.
2.0,Band tears easily and they make wrist have a rash.
2.0,"Only received the deer antler, needed the skull hands :("
2.0,"Would have loved if the calf part of the boot was not so small.  I've never thought of myself as having large calves and never had issues with any other boots- I am so disappointed that these boots are so tight at the top. They just fit (and tightly) if no pants in boots, but I really wanted to be able to wear with pants to keep dry on rainy days. The foot area fit fine (no need to size up as you do with many boots of this type) but you may want to only buy if you have extra small calves. Really cute boots otherwise- but can't keep if you can't wear."
2.0,"I wasn't crazy about the material at all or the fit, but overall the colors are true the picture"
2.0,"very cheaply made, 3 of the cz's have already popped out, I was waiting for another ring just like this to go down in price and then I saw this one. Wish I had waited for the other one."
2.0,"The dress smells weird, and while it technically fits, it’s definitely not for busty women. The fabric and sewing is poor quality too. I’ll probably just wear it as a nightgown?"
2.0,"Thin material, need to wear another layer underneath. I'm only 5'3&#34; and the front of the skirt came up too high to wear as a dress, need to wear leggings underneath."
2.0,"I really like the look of this shirt, but I ordered a medium and was sent an XL. I cant wear other than to bed or around the house. Disappointing."
2.0,Don't buy this for a belly ring is tiny... cute for anything else
2.0,"I ordered this &#34;dress&#34; for an upcoming event, but was very disappointed when it arrived. This is a top and not a dress. The material is very thin and it is extrememly short. You can see right through it. Very poor, cheap material. The shipping was fast, but too costly to send back."
2.0,Had to send these back.  Size was way too small for what they said.  Would have ordered 2 sizes up!
2.0,"My initial review I loved it, but after further review in the light I noticed the jacket and pants were 2 different shades of blue and it was a razor like cut in the jacket. Quality control was not conducted."
2.0,Disappointed that the seams were coming apart upon arrival.  Did sew up all the seams and so now am happy with it. Fabric is a little on the fragile side also.  Love how the color from the photo transferred to the bag.  Colors are bright and beautiful!
2.0,"It does run small. I normally wear a small, occasionally a medium if I want things loose for my mommy belly. Ordered a large based on other reviews and it fit. However, I returned the dress. The skirt part was not as flowy as I had hoped and it hugged my torso. Like I said, I have a mommy belly so it was not flattering at all! I could see where it would look great on someone with flat tummy though so if that’s you, try the dress. Material is thin and drapes well. Not see through. Seems like it may shrink a little in the wash like rayon would but I don’t know....it didn’t come with any instructions."
2.0,Cute top but runs wayyyyyy too small!!!!
2.0,Great quality in material.. make to order a size or two bigger
2.0,"Much shorter than expected, and very thin and dew through. But will make a great swim coverup or pants at the beach, light and airy!"
2.0,They broke after two uses :( and wish they both came in the same color
2.0,Not flattering at all. Looked like grandma shorts.
2.0,Cheap.... my step daughter will wear a few times.
2.0,It’s a tight fit on the size and the pocket already ripped on one side  from just putting hands in
2.0,"Garbage! Don’t waste your money, arm snapped after 3rd wear."
2.0,These earrings are horrible. I wore them three times and each time my ears became more and more enflamed.
2.0,"I ordered a purple one and the one that came was red, so I sent it back plus it was a little too small. It looks great in the picture....."
2.0,"These are comfortable as in laying around on a Sunday, but don't expect to excercise in them because they will fall off. There is absolutely no tummy control to hold them up.<br />I wear a medium and I should have gotten a small. They are too long. The mid section looks nothing like the picture. They are out of proportion with the long inseam. The material is some kind of thin rayon that is not flattering."
2.0,Supposed to be black and white. The white was more gray than white.
2.0,Far too small. Giving it t goodwill.
2.0,"Thought I ordered a terrycloth item, is not what I was looking for but an OK item."
2.0,The back of the suit isn’t close to your skin at all and creates a tent or bubble above your back or the small of the back area. Also color was not as expected either.
2.0,A little small and not much stretch
2.0,Not the best material but you’re getting what you pay for
2.0,I wanted this for Covid protection. I thought it would be great to have a full face shield that could lift up at a restaurant to allow me to eat. But I found that the shield does not cover properly in a vertical position. It hit my nose and does not allow for wearing glasses.
2.0,I like this keychain but it keeps breaking apart at the chain link part
2.0,"I've wanted a &#34;Hollywood Upstairs Medical College&#34; T-shirt for some time and gave this one a try. Unfortunately, the T-shirt is cheap and ill-fitting. With a single wash, the XL shrunk to what I can only describe as a double-wide medium. Just going to have to keep looking..."
2.0,"Don’t love this sports bra. Wish I could return but the window is closed. Wore once, tried to give it a second chance and wore agin but it’s just not supportive enough."
2.0,"Sigh.  I really like the color (light yellow, as pictured) and weight, so I girded myself for all the drawbacks that other reviewers found with this jacket.  It was actually ideal for what I wanted, with surprisingly nice fabric that is eminently (if laboriously) ironable.  It's basically an unstructured jacket that is as light as an overshirt, perfect for after-dinner drinks in very warm weather.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the size 46, which the listing said had 19.5-inch shoulders, actually came with 21.5-inch shoulders. I love the fact that the listing provides detailed measurements -- I just wish they had been accurate."
2.0,Me quedó grande y corto y era la talla M
2.0,"These aren't the least expensive leggings I've bought, but they look the cheapest. I bought the small with some hesitation since in some leggings the smells were too small, but these were too big! Baggy in places especially around the lower thighs/knees. Also, the material is very thin and see through except where the embossed snake skin pattern is. If you hold them up, you can see your hand on the other side. The waist panel had an elastic band inside that felt like it wasn't sewn into the panel, but was just kind of floating around. It did twist inside when I was putting them on and had to straighten it out. The pattern itself looks nicer in the photos and in person looked rather cheap with the ""scales"" being much larger than they look. Anyway, I'll be returning them. They weren't expensive, but they're worth about 2 bucks."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these boots since it looks very warm and comfortable. It is lightweight and the style is cute. It would be great for cold weather as a slip on and slip off bootie. However the sizing was off. My toes were against the tip of the boot without socks so with socks it was pinching my toes and then everywhere else was loose. When I wore it, my feet kept slipping out of the boot since it was so loose. However I do have slim feet so maybe for someone with wider feet, they would not run into my issue. Also the faux fur sheds, I now have black lint everywhere."
2.0,"butt not big enough to fill out the outline of the pants so it puffs out at my waist ridiculously and there you have it- RN to parachute at your service. material is okay but lord it wouldnt fit even if i stuffed the back with a pillow. who were these designed for? if im xxs petite, you can probably assume all of me is that size? you know, proportional? back to cherokee i guess"
2.0,"Poor quality, one of them had a hole in seam and zipper."
2.0,returned. super small and thin cheap fabric. more for a pre-teen maybe..
2.0,"Nice skirt.  However, I am 5'3 and weigh 160 and the Medium size is too large.  Sending back."
2.0,"I like the style and fit of this shirt, but the material doesn’t work well for me because I have long-haired dogs.  My other workout shirts are of smoother texture and don’t attract dog fur.  This shirt is a strong dog hair magnet which doesn’t release the hair easily.  I wish I could have sent it back."
2.0,"These are very cheap feeling handkerchiefs.  Very light weight and coarse feeling.  The majority of the packaging is paper.  the cloth itself is almost see through it is such thin cotton.  It feels like paper and not fabric.  Maybe they'll be better after a wash, but straight out of the package I am very disappointed."
2.0,The lips aren't centered and are low on the shirt making it look skewed. Doesn't open across the shoulders as wide as the picture shows. Had to return.
2.0,Really uncomfortable. Straps didn’t fit anyone in my family (ages 6-37) and just pulled the mask down so it wouldn’t fit right. Would not recommend
2.0,Very small and bad material
2.0,Keeps sliding on foot
2.0,"Two stars only because it fits well and is a well ventilated hat. However, the material wrinkles and creases and you can never get the creases out. Also the bill is made of cardboard unlike most hats which are made of plastic. So it can't be washed. I wear it when I take my trash to the landfill."
2.0,UGLY! waste of money.
2.0,I’ve owned this watch for 6 months. The second hand just fell off inside the case. I like the watch in that it’s stylish but it’s durability seems to be poor. I would not recommend it.
2.0,"Not the quality you expect from Casio.  Yes, i know its only a 10 dollar watch, but it is way over priced at that."
2.0,Received the dress with no tie of the waist ? And I have tried to reached out and no help .
2.0,"It was very cheap and thin material (to the point where everything you wanted covered up was showing). There was also bad stitching (thread was already coming out) was prior to trying on.  When trying to send it back to the seller, it was a hassle trying to get a hold of him (1) and (2) when I finally did get in contact with him, they told me that it would be a waste of time and money to resend it. The seller let me have the swimsuit and was only given 1/2 of my money back. I was very frustrated with trying to get in contact with the seller and they did not solve my problem. There was no way I was ever going to wear it so it was a waste of money and time."
2.0,"Not linen, runs small, cheap looking!"
2.0,Cute and fluffy but the chain came off almost immediately
2.0,"These are hard to put in place, awkward."
2.0,"these are pretty, but the posts are too thick to go through my ear.  I was ill and couldn't return them in time and now I am sad."
2.0,"Wanted it for a church event, too small, no lining, need to return i5"
2.0,"Ordered the correct size but her toes almost hung off edge.  So in my case these ran really small.  I know they are a fashion sandal, but these are really flimsy.  The sole is really thin and the strange thing is as another reviewer mentioned, there is no traction on the bottom so they allow you child to slide. I mean the bottom is covered in a felt material.  I could just see her walking in her school on those floors and slipping and falling.  The fringe is cute but these are simply not practical so will be returning."
2.0,way smaller than what was  expected
2.0,not what i was looking for
2.0,"The dress fits nicely and I love the color, but the fabric is very heavy and a bit clingy. I have not worn it yet so I don't know how I will like until after I live in it for a day."
2.0,"Fast shipping, band (black) looked very nice. No instructions, found some online though.<br />Band would not stay at the required length. Very hard to open clasp when wearing. Next to impossible to reposition the adjustable clasp, refuses to close after 1 use.<br />I also had my boyfriend try it out thinking I was doing something wrong, didn't work for him either.  Such a shame because it really is a nice looking band, seems that it would have been comfortable too."
2.0,"Turquoise color is not a turquoise but more of a teal, color on the picture is off from actual. Very tight fit although I ordered a size up. Keeping it because I can wear it unbuttoned with one of my dresses. Disappointed."
2.0,These were great for about 2 months and then the frame cracked right above the left lens.
2.0,Colors fade fast
2.0,Very pretty looking. But the latch gets loose and causes my fit bit to fall off.
2.0,Pants came apart after only several times worn. Jacket still in good condition.
2.0,"Update  since owning them  2 pair have fallen apart,  the elastic  separates  from the panty.  I  Since  I was needing some new panties, thought  I would give these a try.  They  are  soft and comfortable.  Not  sure  if  they are  a little  smaller than my old ones,  or maybe my old  ones are  just so stretched out.  They do  fit  well though.  The cotton  is  soft  They came  4 packs of three.  so  6 different  patterns.  Cute too.  and with 12 pairs  it  makes it easier for me to  be rid of the old ones . I will not buy<br /><br />Recieved  at a discount for my honest review.  my opinion is they are not so good."
2.0,I am a size large so I ordered a 2x and it was still too small.
2.0,"These were great, initially.  After about a year of wear the sole began to separate at the toe.  I'd expect a Reef product to last longer than one year."
2.0,"It’s not as pictured. The bracelet I received looks very cheap, the stones look plastic & fake and the bracelet is way too small for a normal, adult wrist. The item pictured is not what I received, which is really disappointing because I purchased this to replace one that I loved. Don’t be duped."
2.0,"fell apart after 2 months, decent for the price"
2.0,"This bathing suit is made for someone who has no boobs. I am 32d and I ordered a large (usually I do well with a medium in bathing suits). The band was loose but not too bad. The cups, however, were almost all molded padding - barely any room for actual breasts. This might have worked if the cups were removable. It looked pretty cute though. I wish I could have made it work."
2.0,I am 5'6 and 130 lbs and ordered Medium.  They were very tight in the waist.  I will order a large and see how that works.
2.0,"The quality of this product is not as good as I hoped for. The stitching didn’t look consistent, the material was not very soft, and it definitely looked cheaper than the photo advertised."
2.0,Didn’t fit despite the fact that the measurements said that it should
2.0,"Dingy manufacturing, too loose around the chest, zero nipple coverage."
2.0,"I'm not very impressed. Based on picture it looks like there should be two, but it's only one. The quality is so-so."
2.0,Was not the same color as the photo!
2.0,Did not fit.  Gave them away.
2.0,"The glasses are nice, but the past that goes over the ear fell off."
2.0,I have a small head and I couldn’t get this to fit so I had to take it apart to get it on my head. It does not look nice but keeps my head warm.
2.0,Very ok!
2.0,I had ordered quite a few of these earrings in the past with no issues. I recently ordered 2 more pairs that turned my ears dark green. I was livid. I can't even get a refund.
2.0,Not waterproof. The snow got through easily. Now I've got a cold.
2.0,We thought from the pictures they glow. My boy was very disappointed. Otherwise I'd buy the green one that's said to glow.
2.0,I thought a size 8 would fit a 5yr old and actually be a bit big on her but it is way to small. Buy two sizes bigger.
2.0,No where near as big as you would expect for unisex - large runs about like a medium would be expected. Also still stiff after several washes.
2.0,Cute earrings but magnetics are too loose
2.0,"Way too big, oversize us an understatement"
2.0,My boy liked these but they fell apart before he outgrew them - the soles separated from the shoe.
2.0,It's different from the pictures
2.0,nice and cute butterfly however after a few weeks the little stones started to come off
2.0,The material wasn't as stretchy as i thought it would be. It was also too big.
2.0,"these shorts are super cute! but the elastic band has no stretch so the shorts didn't fit. i bought a size up from what i usually wear because of the elastic band. but it didnt fit still. if your hips are as wide or wider than your shoulders, these are NOT the shorts for you!!! if your super skinny they go for it they will be super cute!!"
2.0,"Ok, I got what I paid for.  It was cheap.  It assembled easily onto my phone, but it is very thin and I don't think it would offer a lot of protection.  It looked nice for a week or two, then it started to get scratches.  Then the edge got caught on something, I think my pocket, and it cracked.  I tried using it for a day or so, but it got caught on everything, so I just pitched it out and got a new, sturdier case.<br /><br />If you are looking for a cool design case that might not last long but makes your phone look different, this is for you.  Just don't expect it to last long with every day use."
2.0,Scratchy and uncomfortable material
2.0,I had to return them because one lens had a distortion flaw in it.
2.0,Great material but was too short. I was looking for a true pencil skirt to come below my knees.
2.0,"I didn't like the material or wear to well, I shipped it back for a refund."
2.0,Runs kind of small....I recommend getting a size up.
2.0,"The gloves I got are not silk. They're nylon. They provide no warmth at all. They're only value might be that they make an air space inside your glove. Worn alone they're no warmer than no gloves at all. They are well made, and stretchy."
2.0,No son frías y siempre pasa el sol deberían de poner otras qe sean frías y de verdad protejan
2.0,"Very small, very small writing"
2.0,MODERNO sells better shirt. Too bad they ran out of US Medium.
2.0,It came in 2 knots. I can not get the knots out so it was shipped back
2.0,"I just found these to not look as cute in person, screen printing looked fuzzy. Felt cheap. I can't rate it a 1* since it was a real possibility these would look cheap, I was just hoping I would like them enough to wear with my Halloween costume. Oh well! Worth a shot"
2.0,Hard to place a return due to cost of shipping  would either order bigger size  or go though another company. unhappy overall
2.0,"These boots barely made it through 3 weeks.  I purchased them on 10/22/16.  I loved the style.  First, the zip ripped on the right boot after 8 days... the fabric on the boot seemed to pull apart.  I was away in the UK, so no real way to return them. Low and behold after the 12th day the left boot ripped in exactly the same place, by the zip.  The so called nice suede simply did not hold up, it started peeling and then finally today, the heel at the bottom of one boot gave way.  I am about to give my review and include pictures... these boots were of a poor standard. If I could give zero stars then I would.  It is simply too much hassle to return the boots."
2.0,The socks aren’t all the same size. The ones that are the correct size work great otherwise.
2.0,"This product seems cool, but much of the fabric is mesh and I don't think it will hold up.  It shipped PRIME, but they are charging me to return.  This is very disappointing, especially because it was fulfilled by Amazon."
2.0,Bracelets look like pictures. They are small to fit over an adult hand/on adult wrist. I bought them for my teaching team and we can't wear them...<br />.the first one snapped when an adult tried to put it over her hand.
2.0,"It was cute except for being too small. Then when I went to put it on for the third wear, the armpit seam got ripped. Such a waste"
2.0,"I am 5'6"" and 150 lbs, pretty evenly distributed. I love the cut of this suit, but the size 12-14 is much smaller than a regular 12-14. The top fit perfectly, but the bottoms were small. At the waist and leg holes the stitching is tight and makes it look like you have fat pouring out.<br /><br />So, I just ordered a 16. Hoping it works.<br /><br />I am usually a size 8-10 in jeans and M in dress pants."
2.0,"I didn't like that it doesn't proportionately fit and the blouse is too short, doesn't cover belt or button"
2.0,i guess for the price what can you expect.  the first one lasted about 2 weeks with minimal use.  the second is already starting to fray.
2.0,Backlight is too weak.
2.0,"Unfortunately even with dead batteries, the alarm that I never set for 11 PM and can't seem to turn off surprisingly works just great."
2.0,This shirt looks cheap up close.
2.0,"Love the scarf length. Love the soft feel. Love the intensity of the colors. Otherwise very disappointed with this item. Fabric is colored on only one side, reverse is white.....This makes it very difficult to position it to wear with only colors showing. Fabric contains ""pulled threads"" in places creating tiny white streaks in cloth. Also has what looks like a ""water"" stain. I am returning it."
2.0,The ball end of the attachment part does not fit through the hole of the Nano kids glasses. I think I will be able to shave a little off the ball to make it work but just beware.
2.0,My glasses came in bent and crooked. Shipping was timely.
2.0,Not worth the price. I cant even read that it says anything. Already falling apart when i opened it.
2.0,Poor fit...hole on the butt area. Not suited for the shapes of the Caribbean woman...the bust area is too small and the waist area is slack. Bathing suit just does not sit right. I'm 5'6&#34; 34C bust and 29&#34; waist this wasn't suited for my size and shape. My mom ordered one and there was the same issue...cant hold the bust and lose in other areas.
2.0,"It just hangs there without any fit. If you like baggy, than this will be the correct choice. Also the neck is pretty high - not a pretty scoop neck."
2.0,Nice material but way too small. I have a 34&#34; waist so I got the 32-34.  The actual size was probably about 31. I measured them against a 34&#34;.  The next size is 36-38. There is no 34-36 so I sent them back and I'll wait for someone to comment on the size of the 36-38.  The waistband is a strong elastic that make the tight fit too uncomfortable.
2.0,Based on reviews I bought a med. Too large on me.the material is a little cheap looking at a well
2.0,I returned these socks as the tops were much too tight. Too bad as the feet fit perfectly and they felt warm.
2.0,"This frame are comfortable and well made, and I like the blue blocker tint in the lens.  What I DON'T like are the 2 tiny circles in each lens, and one lens also has ""1.5"" (the power) inscribed in it.  While not directly in my line of site, I can see these markings as blurs at certain angles!  I have rubbed these lenses with a lens cloth repeatedly, but the markings seem to be etched into the lenses permanently!  Are these sample lenses sold to the retail market?  I have had many glasses over my lifetime, but I have never seen permanent markings in lenses like this!"
2.0,"I usually do the dishes in our house and I almost always wear gloves.<br /><br />I have two big complaints about these gloves though:<br /><br />1. The gloves aren't thick enough to give any insulation from the hot water. All of the other gloves I use keep my hands from getting too hot.<br /><br />2. These gloves aren't grippy at all. Just the opposite, they are super slippery. It's way too easy to drop breakable dishes with these gloves.<br /><br />I like the innovative design and I think these are really clever, but I can't risk breaking my dishes."
2.0,Very cheap. Doesn't look nice at all.
2.0,I had to adjust the ring so that the flower didnt stick straight off my nose. After that it was fine until a month into wearing it. It started turning my nose green and the flower fell off after a 1 1/2 months. I just wish I couldve had it a little longer.
2.0,Not very much padding
2.0,I would have giving it a 5 star but the shirt came stained.  Luckily that when I washed it the stains came out.
2.0,"Didn't look at all as pictured. Disappointing. No circular variations in pattern. Pretty plain. I am not returning. It will be a useful accessory, just not an attractive accent as expected."
2.0,"These pocket squares look nice, but they are small; supposed to be 10 x 10 inches, but are just under 10 inches square as shown in the pictures.<br /><br />They are decent enough pocket squares (they feel a touch thinner than my other pocket square, but still feel sturdy), but folding into more elaborate folds might be difficult due to the small size. Also, they might slip into the pocket for the same reason. However, if you use a pocket square holder and you don't use elaborate folds, then these should work out fine."
2.0,A little too big(could see my bra under my arms) and very see through in the white
2.0,"I was so excited for this product. I put it on immediately when it got to my house. But it was anticlimactic. It feels like the plastic edges will snap at any given moment. it’s a little difficult to take on and off because you fill like you’ll snap it. also difficult to adjust when it’s on your wrist. but, for the price, i think it’s alright."
2.0,Upper sleeves way too tight
2.0,"Just doesn't work for me, but well made just the same."
2.0,This is not a puffy winter coat! The picture is incorrect. I received the lightweight browning jacket. Same pattern but I got a hoodless lightweight jacket. I would return it because I wanted the puffy winter coat but it was a good deal for the lightweight zip up.
2.0,after one summer of wearing and washing it. The color has already faded.... that tells you about the quality of the ink. my husband likes how they fit.... and insists on wearing them.... I think they look ugly now.
2.0,It felt like paper bag
2.0,"This ring is not real silver. I have other silver ones and I know how silver looks like. Ring has a nice look but not real silver. Very disappointed. The ring on the left is mine and the other it's Ever Faith. Silver gets yellowish/dark brown when a little dirty, Ever Faith got really scratched the first time used it."
2.0,"I’m a petite girl - 4’10” and 125 lbs and usually a 4/6 or M (gymnast style muscles). Well, rompers are usually a hit on me no matter what. This one however was SO dang tight in the middle and made me look like I had a muffin top (which I don’t at all). The strips weren’t flattering either. I wouldn’t recommend for anyone tall or short."
2.0,"Colors are not the same as shown, much duller and not as dark or vibrant. Worn a couple times and where the seatbelt and my purse rubs against the shirt it already has a worn out look. Material is cheap. Not sure how it has all these good reviews. Too many fake reviews. No more ordering clothes from amazon for me."
2.0,"Nice shirt and soft fabric. Loved it, but the stitching came loose in one area after the first wash. Too late to return. : ("
2.0,Dropped iphone 6 shortly after putting cover on! Glass broke and frame bent on a corner. Cover provide little or no protection... but the cover looks really nice!?!?!
2.0,"I expected higher quality for the price and brand. The touchscreen feature does work well and the color/overall quality is nice. I like that they snap together and are relatively sleek/stylish for gloves. However, I live in a very windy city (constantly blowing 15+mph) and these do not provide warmth or protection from the wind. When the temperature is below 40, my fingers are cold. Better than bare hands but I would not buy again. If you live somewhere with more mild winters, they would probably be great."
2.0,They don’t seem to stay up on your face. They’re always sliding down
2.0,The picture is very deceiving. I loved it because I thought it had the little stars on it but it does not. It should be stated in the description that the stars are not on the band.
2.0,Sizing runs super small. Only buttoned at my neck. I’d keep it if it only fit!
2.0,"Do not buy this strap unless you are incredibly thin or you are very short. The strap is only 30&#34; long. It is definitely made well, and has a comfy feel to it. BUT the product image is extremely misrepresenting the length of this strap. I am 5'9, 175lbs, I wear a 42R and this strap causes the camera to sit barely passed my armpit when worn like in the picture. The strap isn't designed to be worn around your neck, so right now I'm only using the hand strap because I can only use this strap as a means of transportation, it's virtually useless and awkward in any setting where the camera needs to be held more than 12 inches passed your face."
2.0,"On first use, the screw came out of the strap of the wristlet."
2.0,They are very hard to get of the paper but they serve their purpose . I ruined two of them trying to get them off .
2.0,Doesn't fit at all too small.
2.0,I got these boots on  November 10 and they fit well and kept my feet warm and dry but that only lasted until now December 27th and now I find my feet get wet and cold. They don't last at all barely a month. Now they're garbage had to toss them out what good are they if they don't keep your feet dry
2.0,"It's a nice looking case, however, I am returning it as it does not fit my IP5 and the phone placement is on the inside of the case.  I have two with the phonecase being on the outside, which is a lot more convenient to get to your phone and I also have the phone in a Navor cases as well.  With the phone pocket being on the outside it's easy access."
2.0,The color and fabric were perfect. It was soft and comfortable. There rouching helped to hide my belly fat. But my boobs weren't big enough to fill the top portion of. I probably could have went down in sight I think my boobs still would have been too small to fill the dress out.<br /><br />#ittybittytittycommittee
2.0,Like them ... just too small
2.0,This is cheaply made. The elastic on the top is very loose and is very easy to slide down. The straps are in the very middle and does not support the bathing suit very much. Maybe this product is better for women with bigger chests.
2.0,"Great in appearance, but the seams are too weak. I didn't last me more than a month."
2.0,"The shirt is stiff and scratchy, even after washing it twice. I washed it hoping to make it feel nicer. No luck!  I doubt I will end up wearing it. The image on the shirt is even printed on the crooked! Not high quality at all. Very disappointed!"
2.0,Watch  won't work
2.0,Longer than I realized but cute
2.0,"This product has great elasticity and great hold on the Velcro but separates with movement, sitting down and getting back up, driving. Not what I expected. Return/Refund"
2.0,"Lovely necklace, BUT it tangles so easily,  even while it’s being worn!  I  spent so much time just trying to untangle it.  It now sits in my drawer (too late to return!). Big disappointment."
2.0,Said it was a poly/cotton mix. It's  100% poly! Talk about false advertising!!
2.0,"Really comfortable. But sadly, plast of the sole detached from the shoe within a few weeks"
2.0,"This is a very pretty necklace and reasonably priced. But the chain broke easily when a hair strand got caught in it - when I attempted to pull the thin strand of hair out, the chain broke, Its flimsy."
2.0,The silver is shinny. Looks more like a dull gray.
2.0,very painful
2.0,"I love the concept of the design of this suit for mature fashionable women, but it runs small. I'm 5'5&#34; 162 lbs. I purchased a large from amother Amazon Seller and it fit perfect, but the large from this Seller was way too small. I gave it 2 stars  because I like the patriotic theme and fast delivery."
2.0,"Upon opening, the first thing I noticed was the different colors/pattern edges leave like a thick, fuzzy fringe. Loving the looks of them, I wore them to work anyways (I'm a nurse). I've always worn another brand that initially work well but only last like 6 months so I decided to try these. Initial reaction was they had really great pressure in the right areas, but only a few hours into my shift and the HEAT of them was obviously noticeable. By 1pm, I honestly was so uncomfortably hot that I ended up taking them completely off and putting on a normal pair of socks. I've been a nurse for 10 years(10 years of ICU and now in a more laid back area) and I've actually never had to remove a pair of socks in a day but it was unbearable. I'm disappointed that they were a half day and done pair of socks but I definitely won't be wearing them, again. The pressure amongst the sock was great, heat not so much. And the all that fuzzy fraying on the inside, I could see them falling apart quickly, too, after washing."
2.0,"I'm giving this two stars because it is indeed a &#34;semi sheer soft&#34; scarf.  The fiber content on the listing is inaccurate, however, they are pretty much all polyester.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but if it matters to you, there it is."
2.0,Cute and small. Love the color. The zippers broke on my 2nd day of use though!
2.0,I don't think these are polarized.
2.0,"i wear a size x-small or size 4. this small is very uncomfortable.<br />i'm 5'5""  and weigh 125 lbs.<br />elastic waist is very snug. and in the wrong place.  high waist but not high enough for priness cut. and too high for comfort.  hits me right under my ribcage.<br />the fabric is really nice. soft, light weight, stretchy"
2.0,"Nice size, but material looks fairly cheap in person."
2.0,"It's a cute dress but the interior lining was extremely sheer and would not offer any additional coverage. The top half fit fine but maybe my bottom half is just a little too large for the lining, it was so short it didn't cover my butt. Will be returning."
2.0,"Pretty earrings but they irritate my ears and make them swell, itch, and hurt so I can't use them. Not good for sensitive ears."
2.0,I liked the color and texture of this shirt and was disappointed that the fit was very odd. If you are larger chested this will not work for your. Even if you aren't I don't think the cut of the shirt across the chest would fit properly on anyone.
2.0,No es completamente de mi agradó
2.0,I am returning this as I wore it once and it for a hole by the pocket. It is really cute and I’m going to try and get another one. The green color I ordered was fairly shear so I think I’ll go with a darker color this time and hopefully the second one won’t fall apart. I’ll add another review once I get the replacement one.
2.0,The top fit great but the flowy part on the bottom of the shirt is HUGE!
2.0,its normal
2.0,"I so so so wanted to love this ring. And in theory I do. It's beautiful, but it looks more like a cheap glass than a stone. And while it fits beautifully, the color faded REALLY fast, which was really disappointing to me for the price, as the other ring pictured literally to this day I wear every day and it looks good as new for a third of the price."
2.0,I read on the description that this was 95 percent cotton. It is actually 95 percent polyester! Not happy about that!
2.0,Really long for me and im 5'7 about 155 lbs
2.0,"This shirt fit really big. The material is pretty cheap. I really liked the pattern, so I gave it to my mom who is much larger chested (and I ordered this in a small)."
2.0,there solid built except for the weild on the edge for the belt hook up breaks real easly
2.0,Very long. Had to give away to someone else
2.0,"Ordered the 1/2&#34; wide skewer blade, got a 1&#34;.  Now I have to go out and buy some big delicious meaty steaks to cook.  My diet is ruined, and I blame you, incorrect skewer order."
2.0,My husband wears an XL but this brand runs much smaller than expected. I am comfortable in a L but these are even small for me as they do not cover my nose.
2.0,White fabric is cheap and see through... Too small for my daughter so I triedbro return and was told return fee was more than item cost...
2.0,Got this for daughter for open to elements job. Way too thin. She wants more cotton/wool flannel fabric not polyester feel
2.0,"Be aware, needs to be hand washed and not machine dried."
2.0,"I loved this purse, up until the strap broke. Enough said."
2.0,very cheap look plus sewing is so bad i could do better job at home
2.0,Not for a plus girl
2.0,"The only reason this product is getting a two star is because the style of this watch is classic and looks identical to the product photo.<br /><br />However, the watch clasp breaks off easily and is not covered under warranty. Sure it's not an expensive watch, but it should last longer than a few months."
2.0,It's nothing special. I would not recommend buying this necklace. It looks very cheap and feels cheap as well. It broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,Print is pretty but very short
2.0,As soon as I got this product one of the grommets fell out and since it has lost a few more however the belt is made very well and has held up for months of use. This belt shows no signs of breaking down
2.0,The lenses are larger than the original<br />Ray ban lenses. I basically had to force them into the frames but they still do not sit quite right. They must not have the proper dimensions for a good fit.
2.0,"It is cute, it gives a good body, but delicate, the threads do not go away at all."
2.0,"Item came as pictured, however poorly assembled as the foot came off after only two weeks. It has a notch that does not fit snug and would need glue to adhere it."
2.0,If you want to look heavier these are for you! So soft with no support at all. They feel like they might last for a week. Not for me. They are not like the photo they go all the way down to my knees ( cringe)
2.0,"I like the style and quality of the glasses, but the ""reader"" portion is some kind of sticker.  Not sure it is in the right place or if it needs to be bigger."
2.0,The band feels and looks cheap. Colors are def not as bright and vivid as in the product photo.
2.0,"Beautiful glass charms. However, about 10 of them arrived broken. Hoping to use with for making bracelets with my young daughter but had to remove all the little broken glass pieces first."
2.0,Too tight around the sleeves.
2.0,"This top could've been cute but the sizing was wildly inconsistent. I ordered this in size small in three different colors. One fit me, another was too tight and the third was huge. I returned them all (including the one that fit) because the fabric was too thin for me. Cute neckline, though."
2.0,very pretty design and looks amazing on but the latch is weak and there is discoloration of the metal after less than a day of wear.
2.0,"felt less comfortable than the usual less expensive brands. if you're a bigger guy, the waist band rolls up if you know what I mean"
2.0,Good colors<br />Thin Material
2.0,"Had to return wayyyy to small, I love the print though."
2.0,I liked the style but the material is ripping with holes after 2 washings.
2.0,"A couple of them, the galaxy pictures had wrinkles. In the add, they appear to have depth, but it's pretty much just a mediocre picture, with a shallow glass dome on it."
2.0,"The eyewear is cute.<br />Obviously, very affordable and basic but the lenses are made poorly.<br />I purchased a different style from the same vendor and they were fine, which leads me to believe this style was made improperly."
2.0,"Not impressed, it was too small."
2.0,Cheap material and not fitted correctly. Bought for adult. Donated to a kids group.<br />Not recommended
2.0,"For some reason it is impossible to find nose studs with an adequate ball on the end to prevent stud from falling out easily. THIS would be a necessary improvement. As it is, since they fall out so easily, all 20 of these will be lost in a short time"
2.0,You get what you pay for. Poor quality. I do not recommend it.
2.0,Cute colors but the fit is very strange. Tight and very baggy in other areas.
2.0,"you get what you pay for, in this case."
2.0,"Super thin, you can see underwear designs/diaper patterns through the Leo. It’s cheap and definitely looks that way. Stitching came loose after first wash. Runs true to size though."
2.0,"I ordered these socks for my teenage son for a hiking trip.  I received the box with the socks, a toy cash register and some hand and foot warmers. On arrival the box smelled very strongly like body odor .  Once I opened everything I found it was the socks, which were sealed in plastic, that smelled like a dead animal.  They looked new and unused so I have no idea what the problem was.  I had to wash them twice and they still have a faint smell to them.  I bought different socks at Bass Pro for my son because I'm worried that once they start hiking in them the smell will come back. Pretty gross!"
2.0,"I usually wear a Large.  Based on the reviews, I knew it ran small so I ordered an XL.  It was still tight around my stomach area and does not have a flowy look like the one pictured.  Overall, it's meh."
2.0,"The band around the top sock is tight, very uncomfortable."
2.0,Material is not of good quality. Will only be using as a shirts to sleep in. Already balling up after just a couple washes.
2.0,"Beautiful watch, but WAY too big for my wrist -- it looked ridiculous. Wish they had a version for women that's a little smaller -- not just unisex sizing."
2.0,"Shoes are really hard,  the nubs are very stiff.  Makes it difficult for your feet to reach the points where you can feel the tens unit."
2.0,"This wrap is really cute. I ordered it because it reminded me of something katniss wore in hunger games. It is supposed to be a one size fits all but unfortunately that is not the case. It’s incredibly long so despite the instructions, it’s still way too big and just falls off. The quality and color are nice but this will not work for all body types. It’s just too big."
2.0,"It might just be me, but I found these difficult to put in and uncomfortable to wear once I did get them on.  Quality was fine.  Maybe just not the style for me."
2.0,The fit is good.  Length is appropriate for school. It’s a little on the thin side.  It needs something underneath for sure.  I gave it 2 stars for that reason.
2.0,Color is more black . green is barely visible
2.0,"I got this hat for my husband and he doesn’t like it at all, as it doesn’t have the same fit as a regular hat.  It’s kind of hard to describe the fit, but it’s almost like it wasn’t made quite right.  It just fits on the very top part of the head, but doesn’t come down on the head enough to fit snuggly, so it’s almost falling off."
2.0,"I loved the print and colors but unfortunately the dress was way too small.  I usually wear a size Large, and I ordered an XL.  But it was still too small and tight to be able to wear."
2.0,"My arms are bigger than average, but I returned this because it was too tight"
2.0,"Product arrived and the material feels very thin and cheap, this will not last.  Hook is just ok and not sure if this will hold up."
2.0,I was expecting a cotton linen dress but this definitely has a different fabric content - kinda polyester feel mixed with cotton. It looks like an absolute sack out of the bag but the fit when it was worn was not bad. It is super voluminous in the middle and has a cute hemline. The ends of the 3/4 sleeves were pretty narrow and I could not roll them at all (and my arms are pretty average). Not very flattering on me so I am returning it.
2.0,This pant is very comfortable  but pills very easily even before washing. Rather expensive for cheap material. Good for lounge pant. Would not buy again.
2.0,Not as cute as pictured. Runs small
2.0,Loved the look and feel of these bracelets but they broke after only a few times wearing them.
2.0,"Could only grip on very end of nose, where it was painful."
2.0,It hung weird
2.0,"I am normally a size US 12, ordered XL (I expected it to be on the smaller size but xxl was not available and I decided to give it a try) - it is small..i would say it will fit in between 10 and 12.<br />Dress looks nice, I was surprised, however, it is Polyestery Nd in the description it is stated it is rayon or viscose. Back it goes. Maybe if they restock a larger size I'll get it, for the nice color!"
2.0,"This product is not as advertised. The fabric is not the same and the actual cut is strange. With respect to my experience, I ordered two sizes up and they almost fit around my high waist, but the legs are super short, the crotch hangs down low, and they don't fit well. In the photo the fabric is different and the fit is slim, high waist, with the long trouser wide leg look that slumps around the shoe or boot. That's an actual style. These jeans are frumpy, and not any style.  The color is really light blue faded, not the color shown. The photos should be of the actual product, not of a product for which a similar item is modeled from, that's not fair to the online consumer.  Also, the US have standardized sizes, those should be followed so people can get what they are expecting based on the size they know that they can wear.<br /><br /> I am 5'8"" 130.  I wear a 28 Long jean size. Waist is 28. My hips are 35.  My inseam is around 32/33.  I ordered these jeans for length, and they are 40"" from the top of the waist band to the hem.  I ordered size large, and the length reported in the size chart was to be 41.32 inches. That's almost 2 inches shorter than the advertised length. The size of jeans should be standardized at by country so that it makes sense to the online buyer. The photos must be of the exact product and the color should be exact.<br /><br />This size large jean has the following measurements.<br />Across the front of hip is 19 inches<br />Across the top of the waist band is 14 inches.<br />The total length from top of waist band to hem is 40 inches.<br />The zipper is 6 inches.<br />The inseam is 28 1/2 inches<br />The waist band to crotch is 14 inches<br /><br />One leg is about 1 inch longer in front that the other side.<br /><br />Essentially they are too far off.  Given that according to the size chart I would have ordered a medium, but  I ordered a large.  I figured, since I'm doing fabric painting and having a bit of a retro vibe happening, if I order large I can modify the jeans and use them. The color is different than shown so I will have to dye the fabric, and then perhaps ad fabric to the length, and a few other alterations. But, these are not the jeans shown and the entire fit around the hips and waist is not flattering either. Jeans can be great, they can fit well and look good, just not these jeans.  It looks like the holes were copies on a similar type of jean, but they are not made correctly.  If you look at the ad a few times, you realize that there are two pair of jeans featured and they are not the same jeans either, but neither shown in the ad are what I received. Sadly. They could be cute and fun if they were the right jeans. These are very light faded, thicker jeans with no drape to the fabric, very stiff, and the cut is wrong also.<br /><br />All that being said, I do offer photos and my measurements, and my expected size. I you like the images you may like the jeans.<br /><br />2 stars"
2.0,"I ordered these in the red color and LOVED them.  I immediately ordered 2 more, the black and green camo.  When I got them they were totally different leggings. No logo, totally different material, they were baggy and had just one piece of thin elastic at the top that made them awkward to wear."
2.0,"The docks look nice bout will never know how the feel, wear or perform.  I wear a size 7 women's shoe and the socks are about two inches too long from heal to toe."
2.0,"I decided to take a chance on some of the cheaper more basic clothing items.  While most of my order wasn't disappointing this cardigan was. Its basically like wearing a unflattering T shirt. The material doesn't flow and looks very frumpy.  Doesn't look as heavy or even the same shade of green,"
2.0,"It fit perfectly for a New Years Party, but haven't worn it since because all the sequins started falling off. very poorly made."
2.0,"I knew this wasn’t gonna be an OMG AMAZING item. It’s still dainty and cute. The actual chain should be longer. The extra long extender looks extremely cheap and tacky at the longest part of the extension, the necklace fell to about 18 inches give or take. And to put it at the shortest chain, it was like an extremely tight choker, leaving an extra long tail. For the price, you’d expect slightly better quality. This prob should be 20-25 bucks instead."
2.0,"Our three year old son loved these, and we wouldve preferred to keep them, however, one of the shoes wouldn't hold a charge for longer than an hour or so. They seemed to be very comfortable and lightweight, but as stated, wouldn't hold a charge."
2.0,Shirt is constantly riding up. Shorts are constantly slipping down. It's very uncomfortable to wear if it was wearable for longer than 2 minutes.<br />The sizes are off. I ordered my usual size and it fit more like 2 sizes smaller.
2.0,Cheap quality. Fringes were extremely wrinkled and stuck together. I was disappointed.
2.0,"Ordered by waist size in description, the size tag inside the product indicates as ordered but they are at least 4 inches larger in the waist than stated in the listing. More trouble to send back than worth, will give them to someone larger than me."
2.0,This item has no give! A romper should have extra stretch to take off and put on easy!
2.0,"It works. Which is why I gave it two stars. Although, the quality of the material is exactly what 15 and change will get you. The connector piece for the safety string broke as I put it on. Plus, no matter how I adjust the nose piece, the glasses sit so far from my face that it's almost like not wearing them at all. My face could be the wrong shape, though. I returned them."
2.0,I usually wear a large but decided to size up and ordered an extra large. The extra large fit ok. It wasn’t tight but the bottom seam had no stretch to it which made it hard to take off. The material is a slick material which is nice but the straps are awkwardly placed and roll in when doing shoulder work. It is comfortable but there are other options on amazon for the same price that I would go with.
2.0,Cute top.<br />Would look better on me if I lost some weight in the tummy area.
2.0,Had to return - wat too big - did not want hassle and the fabric did not feel nice at all.
2.0,Barely fit my 8 year old granddaughter’s head.
2.0,This item runs small and the seams in the cups are very unflattering.  The seams are very noticeable under your shirt.  This is an okay item if you are wearing under a sweatshirt but not under a typical workout shirt (in a fitness class or for a summer/spring day run).  If I had kept the packaging I would have returned it.  It runs small.  I can't breathe in it.
2.0,I was not able to download the app to the mask it gave know instructions on how to charge or turn on the divice.
2.0,"The fabric was very attractive. The fit was good. One of the pockets was not sewn in properly, such that there was a slight bunching of the fabric at the seam which made the pocket stick out."
2.0,Very large for my small face.
2.0,"Se supone que el artículo en su reseña dice que es de lino, pero en realidad es de Algodón y poliéster. Si bien el artículo me quedó bien, deberían poner más atención en verificar si el producto es el que están vendiendo o no."
2.0,"The material seemed cheap, buttons were a risk with how loosely they were sewn on. Overall to large in the shoulders and the look was not the same as advertised. To the sellers credit they made the process of return fairly simple as well as staying in contact regularly with me during the returns process."
2.0,"Cute shirt and my daughter loved it. Unfortunately, it fell apart after literally three washes"
2.0,Basically they are a bunch of CRAP<br />Don’t buy them - they SUCK
2.0,"It's very difficult for much of anything to be too small for me. I'm 62 yrs, 4'10"", 85 lbs, 34c, short torso. This shirt fits all except where it buttons across the breast. It is about 2 sizes too snug compared to the rest of the shirt. The fabric has a larger rib design than pictured and is not form fitted or as soft as depicted. The snug fit in chest is NOT a ""flattering snug"" simply because of the fabric, shape, and style, or maybe it's just made badly. Regardless, would not recommend or order again."
2.0,Very small I wish they would have started from the biggest pair then up
2.0,Way smaller than the sizing chart states. I bought accordingly but should have went a size up. Maybe even two sizes. I literally for the life of me could not get it sinched shut. I will attempt to order again bigger. I loved how it was made. The torso is longer as I wanted. Wished it would have worked out the first time!
2.0,I bought this for a Christmas party am 5'5' 150 and always got a large and that worked. i bought this dress in a L and XL there was no difference in the sizes and my husband could not zip them up on me  }:
2.0,Voice modification barely works.
2.0,"I love the color and style but the arms are so tight that it's uncomfortable to wear, I do not recommend this dress unless you have skinny arms."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:7c44f9f71ef0256058eee07180810786]] I returned this item because despite the fact it is very pretty and very easy to resize, there is a defect on the last clip which will cause it to open and fall off your wrist while you wear it. I have attached a video to this review showing that defect and how it works. I am giving this product two stars because if it were not for that defect it would have five, but it becomes essentially useless if it can’t stay on."
2.0,"These are pretty.. not as small as I thought actually. They hang off the ear a little lower than expected, but they were a steal for being real gemstones.<br /><br />Update 12/04/19:<br />Completely tarnished. Not durable. Price point reflects the quality, I guess.."
2.0,"I ski in Colorado and was looking for some replacement goggles. I ended up getting these ones since I really liked the look of them. They are fairly comfortable as well after a full day using them.<br /><br />However, they are not polarized so you get pretty bad glare from the snow. They also claim to have UV protection, I still got sunburnt through the goggles all around my eyes.<br /><br />I won't be using these again and will be getting a different pair of goggles."
2.0,Not what I expected but it serves a purpose
2.0,Perfect if you want a swimsuit cover up or a shirt to wear with leggings. This is very see through and fit very tight I would order the size up.
2.0,I'm tall so I didn't expect a long baggy sweater but also didn't expect this to be almost a crop top!!!!  Whatevs will work for Halloween
2.0,"The color is much lighter then pictured. FYI, you have to measure your waist and not go by your pants size."
2.0,"Love how these look, feel, and fit but unfortunately the seam ripped at the butt while I was wearing them. They’re a year old and I only have worn them a handful of times, so they don’t last long."
2.0,Cheap. Very fake looking/feeling leather. They stretch out and you will be tightening the adjusters every other time you wear them.
2.0,"the material isn't as warm as the previous model.  more plastic, not as neoprene.  I tend to have high expectations for Under Armor products.  These are very disappointing.  I would not recommend them for anything involving actual cold weather."
2.0,I was very disappointed that this ran so small. One review I read said it runs small so I ordered a size larger than I would have. Let me note that the cover up runs REALLY SMALL.
2.0,The suit looks cheap
2.0,I ordered this as a Wonder wallet insert. It is not.
2.0,"They’re really comfortable, but the Velcro keeps coming undone which makes the shoe fall off. Irritating. Plus, when they get wet, they STINK and make the child’s feet stink."
2.0,Sleeves fit funny
2.0,Peeled within two weeks of purchase. Sad. The first one I purchased lasted over a year.
2.0,"My son lives the design, and the fit was great.  My issue is that we have now washed it a few times and it’s all pilly.  He wears sweatshirts to school every day instead of a heavier jacket (we live on Long Island), and then he wears it basically all day, comes home and takes it off around dinner time.  We wash it pretty often, like once every other week.  He rotated between five or six sweatshirts...but this one just isn’t holding up as well.  It’s not necessarily falling apart, but he has others that have stayed much better."
2.0,"No size chart so I went UP from usual medium to large (I'm 135  5'9"") and it fits like a sausage skin. I laid it on a counter and measured and it was 36 inches across the chest. The Larges I'd been looking at were advertised at 38-39 and usually have some play in that for ease. 36 for total width gives no ease for sports tops. Too bad, they're cute but the fabric feels like it would be hot here in AZ unless there was some drape to it, not touching your skin everywhere. Too bad, waste of time, going back. They are cute, but if you don't like to wear your tops skin tight, go way up in size."
2.0,The photo is really blurry on the earrings. They totaly edited the photos or did something to it...
2.0,not quality wise
2.0,Item received damage. Didn’t send back since it would cost more to return
2.0,I ordered the size that I wear in leggings and these could not even go all the way up my legs. The fabric is soft and feels nice but is way too tight and is completely see-through the second it stretches.
2.0,"I payed for early shipping, but it came late and I could not use it for the event I ordered it for. I did size up, but it does run very small. Even the sleeves are a bit short on me. On their picture you can barely notice the two metal bars that adorn the chest of the blazer. It is very noticeable and it gives the impression that you work for an airline."
2.0,It looks wider and longer on the picture.
2.0,"the shirt cut out looks off and doesnt look good , it looks weird . The material seams like a cheap bathing suit material , the sizing of this is big because I ordered a size smaller and it fits other than me not liking how it looks on me"
2.0,These fit well and seem like the they would work well. But the chemical smell is unbearable. I couldn't stand the smell for more than a couple minutes and returned them.
2.0,Print was super cute. Came out just like the picture but sizing is way off. I returned
2.0,This looks good but is extremely thin. My husband can feel the large patch on the back while wearing it.
2.0,I don't think these are made for American women  odd fit and too small
2.0,"So I just got my order today and I was kind of dissapointed and happy at the same time. So as you can see I cut mine, I honestly like it better as socks rather than tights. I cut it right down the middle and just took off a bit more. The tights wouldn't even come up to my thighs. I'm like 5'6 and even though they were thingy they were short too. So I rolled the excess fabric and just made them into socks basically."
2.0,Stayed on for a couple of wears - lost adhesive fairly quickly compared to others.
2.0,"This dress was awful. I purchased this in hopes to find a bridesmaid dress but I looked like a nun. Hey if thats you're style, then go ahead and order it. The front ties are awful, it gave me grandma boobs. The material was nice though, so that's a positive."
2.0,"very poor quality of material too hard to put on, never did get them on, this is a terrible pair of shoes"
2.0,The eyes of my rod were to big to fit through
2.0,FIts very small....
2.0,"Love the material. No elastic in the waistband so it keeps falling down. Very annoying. That's the reason I wanted high waist, to stay up & not fall down."
2.0,Faded after one wash in cold- it was a bummer because the print and color was really pretty. It is really a long shirt.
2.0,I'm 5'7 and 146#. The large was too tight.
2.0,The plugs fit perfectly but I got sent two completely different looking plugs. One has vibrant pinks all throughout and the other has mostly dull greys and a small amount of pink.  Whoever packaged them didn't care enough to at least match up the colors which really sucks because they don't feel like a pair.
2.0,Changing colors of the leather not waterproof will not last a long time
2.0,"Do yourself a favor, and spend a little more money on decent ones. These are not worth it.<br />I only use these for keys, and they break with in just a few days of using. Also it says multicolored, im not sure about anyone else but I only got two colors: pink and gold.<br /><br />Two stars only because you get a lot in a pack if you dont care about them breaking and just want to blow through a pack quick."
2.0,"ordered a size bigger, should of ordered 2 size bigger!"
2.0,"Pretty gaudy.  I got it for a little girl, and it was big and very much like costume jewelry.  But it would be great if that was what you were looking for!"
2.0,While the color choices are nice the band itself is just too thick and won’t charge right while the band is on and it’s too hard to remove. I will be returning these bands.
2.0,"I ordered two of these dresses in different sizes (M and L) and colors (black and dark blue). I am 5'5"", 160 lbs, 36F, normally wear dresses size 12 and bottoms sizes 8/10.<br />M was too small in my opinion, mainly due to very thin type of material. Large was much better fit. Color wise I liked black better. However, it's more like a summer dress therefor black wasn't a right choice. When hubby saw me, he asked why I am dressed in garbage bag... It's an interesting style, so if you used to more classic style, you will feel weird in this dress. Lighter color ones might be see through so watch out for this detail.<br />The quality however doesn't correspond to asking price in my opinion. I had multiples loose ends all over my dress and I don't see it holding well through the laundry."
2.0,Fits weird. Kind of shapeless. Does not flatter the waist. Arms way too tight.
2.0,"These were way smaller than the picture! Cute earrings, but about the size of a pea."
2.0,Nice pretty watch. Downfall : came in awful plastic box which caused 2 different tears in strap.
2.0,The Light is not working
2.0,"Band needs to be 14-15 mm longer.<br />Item not specified as Men / Women.<br />Item received states 100 % satisfaction, but no response from ""wristologywatches.com"""
2.0,"Let me start off by saying these earring look to be very good quality. I was very excited to change out my piercings & did a whole lot of comparing and contrasting between sets of earrings, decided on these. I wanted to be able to wear these while sleeping , showering , & working out. Unfortunately, it came missing 7 pairs , & the pack of hoops. I had to come back to the listing to make sure I was correct & yep. Now I wasn’t going to return them because I was really excited for the rhinestone cartilage earring & figured I’d just work with what I got. However the ball doesn’t unscrew from the earring , the rhinestone part does ? Which was very confusing and I ultimately just gave up. I’ve decided to return these , went through a lot of trouble for a pack of earrings that didn’t come with what was advertised. :("
2.0,"Print was good and clear, shirt is soft but it's oddly sized. I would recommend sizing up one. It was a little short on my husband and the arms were on the tight side. It don't mind the tight arms 😜 but my husband does."
2.0,"Fit is about right, but cut in such a way (i.e., front panel so narrow) that my nipples show. And I'm not a huge bro or anything like that either. Not the look I'm going for."
2.0,"I really did not like the way these shoes looked in person. I was hoping for a stronger gold color instead of the pale, muted metallic. It kind of looked like the color on the shoes had been rubbed off or was chipped at some point, only it also looked like it was supposed to look this way. Hard to describe, but ultimately just unappealing.<br /><br />I do not recommend."
2.0,I bought this for a wedding but ended up using a smaller wristlet - this is a pretty bag but essentially made of cardboard - feels flimsy.
2.0,Dislike they were to small
2.0,I have had this product a month now. The gold plating has rubbed off all ready.
2.0,"Sharp edges on some rings, rings are quick to discolor (4-5 uses before noticeable discoloration), and some are just way too small. Not enough of a good deal."
2.0,"It was a good backpack for about a week, then the zipper broke."
2.0,No me agrado pues no es una sudadera es simplemente una playera en forma de sudadera la tela es como si fuera una playera normal no engañen ala gente
2.0,"The eyes were painted on, and it was not painted on well.  However, I thought it was still cute so I kept it and wore it, but had to stop putting it on because it caused some kind of allergic reaction that resulted in rashes around my forearm. It is now just an ornament in my car."
2.0,Like the design but it snags really easy.  I didn't get to wear it once before they tore.
2.0,Cute dress but very short
2.0,I love it but it broke so very easily. I was upset.
2.0,It came cracked but had to try to super glue it because it was needed the very next day
2.0,"Nice shirt for a soccer playing boy, but it was too small.  It was returned."
2.0,"The shoe looks cheap and it isn't cute at all. The material feels like a combination of plastic and velvet (weird) and there are embedded crinkle marks from the plastic it was wrapped in. The seams also looks like it was glued on to the sole of the shoe, not sewn. I wonder how many wears I could get away with before the seam rips off completely? I'm guessing not many! Welp, this was a bust. I will be returning this item as soon as possible."
2.0,"This jean is made with 95% cotton and 5% spandex. It is soft and very stretchy. The fabric is not too thin or too thick. However, this jean is not well made, no matter the stitch or the pocket on the back, and the zipper is also not smooth.  It is also fits too small, you'd better order 1-2 size up."
2.0,Short at waist. Picks up a lot of lint
2.0,"They are pretty poorly constructed. Even as I unpackaged them (carefully), there were finger/paw pad pieces that looked like they wanted to fall off. I sent them back and found a better alternative for my Halloween costume needs."
2.0,"It gave me no shape, the material was thin and flimsy."
2.0,There was a big tare in it. Cheap fabric!
2.0,"The suit is just ok. If you have a larger chest, you know the pain of holding everything up with a knot at the base of your neck. The ties on this suit are way too short and after less than 20 minutes wearing this bathing suit, I had harsh red lines on my neck from the strap ties. It’s cute, but I’ll never wear it again because it hurt so much."
2.0,feels like nylon.  does not feel like cotton at all
2.0,Fits fine before I washed it then it shrunk  Will order a large next time
2.0,No good does not stay on slips off
2.0,As soon as you wash it the bows come off the leg warmers. I am going to hot glue them back on. She will be wearing a baggy first birthday outfit.
2.0,The dress I ordered was very thin! And the quality was disappointing.
2.0,"I like the bag, but it didn’t hold up to my expectations. Need to be more sturdy and durable."
2.0,"This looked so pretty on the picture but there’s not enough beads on the strands so it looks like missing teeth in spots. Also, the clasp is weak. Gotta return it. Bummer."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this product, after reading other reviews and the Q & A's I decided to give them a try. First and foremost they are NOT thick or solid. They are 100% thin and see through. You cannot wear these just as shorts, which is the entire reason I wanted them. Second, they were entirely too small. The description says to order your size as usual because they have been converted from Asian sizes to US sizes. The size was still way off. In typical leggings I wear a size L, which usually fit slightly tight, but not buldging or uncomfortable for me. I ordered these in a XXL to be safe, thinking I'd rather have them slightly too big then too tight. They are still too tight. Tight enough that I will be returning them unfortunately. A note I'd also like to make is that the trim is like hard lace, so they were decently uncomfortable and even tighter around the legs at the lace. I decided on 2 star's because the item description is just absolutely wrong and misleading, but in the end if you are a smaller women and you ordered a XXL they'd probably work good for you. Moral of the story, don't be fat I guess lol"
2.0,I had bought another Jedi tunic outfit of a different color from another seller and wanted to get the black one also. The one I bought from the other seller was made really nice. The cloth felt nice and strong. It's like a thick cotton. This one though is definitely thinner material that is shiny and looks weird when light bounces off of it. It's pretty much the exact same fit as the other one I got but the quality of the material is just really cheap.
2.0,"Very very very stretchy but nice support around the waist.<br />I wouldn't say it snatches your waist but does have compression.<br /><br />I have a short torso so it was really high but not terrible, I was able to fold it over a bit.<br /><br />The ""holes"" in the leggings are fake...it's just a black hole pattern.<br /><br />I bought these in 2/2020 and now there's a run going down the bum.<br /><br />I do a lot of hitt workouts.... But I won't be wearing these outside the house as I'm worried they'll split down the middle."
2.0,"Big calves beware. They make great statements at the ankles, though."
2.0,Cheap purse...faux shiny letter...
2.0,Very weird fit. Does not fit like the picture. I wish I would've returned it.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress. The fabric was soft BUT:<br />The body of the dress was very big and<br />The tiny sleeves were very tight and<br />The hemline was VERY sloppy, twisted and unprofessional. If I’d made this myself I’d redo that awful hem before I’d wear it in public. Plus, it’s hard to understand how the body could be so loose and the sleeves so little. Maybe they put size SM sleeves on an XL body. I’m 5’6”/135 and I ordered a large."
2.0,"Very disappointed, item not as described.<br />The coverup material looks and feels cheap.  It's shiny, not like the soft looking fabric pictured.  It is SMALL!! I wear a US size 6/8 with a small chest.  I was hoping the coverup would drape the way it does in the picture, but it made me look like I was wrapped in a sausage casing.  Unless you are uber petite and don't mind the cheap fabric, I would not recommend."
2.0,"The shape of the hearts are very wide and a little strange looking which was sort of off-putting, but perhaps I will get used to it."
2.0,"I got this for my daith piercing but it doesn't stay clasped. It barely snaps together and isn't a strong hold. It is cute so I went ahead and super glued it. (Don't worry - it doesn't last forever, I've done this before on my belly button piercing because it kept falling out.) It would have been nice if it had a stronger clasp though."
2.0,"These would have been great because they were fairly easy to get on BUT my ears got terribly infected. I have<br />6 piercings on each ear and everyone of them got infected.  I even cleaned them...my ears are still swollen and<br />tender and I haven't had them in my ear for over 3 days.  I have never had an issue like this before, so it's not like<br />I have sensitive skin."
2.0,Looks the same as expected except it has sharp pcs of irregular shaped metal on the inside. I have not worn it because of sharp spots
2.0,The creases do not go away.
2.0,It’s a little too big for my head and it came dented on one side. I guess it’ll have to work.
2.0,Really cute but super small. I searched diligently for wider frames and these were described as such with over 140 mm. Not so. They were extremely small. Disappointed.
2.0,If light weight is important to you then these should fit the bill. However that light weight makes these feel flimsy. The metal portion especially doesn't seem too strong. I have prescription aviator glasses and these sat up way too high by more than a quarter inch in fact nearly one half inch. All aviator glasses I've seen have a metal bar running across the top of the lenses and that's what prevents these from lowering in the proper position.<br />UPDATE: The metal portion between the left and right lenses came apart despite careful handling. This plus the poor fit makes these a 1 to 2 star rating.
2.0,"Returned, look cheap"
2.0,This are really small<br />I'm an 8 and order a large and they don't even go over my tights
2.0,"Looks nice, however I don't know for how long...first time I  use it and I notice the bridge that secures the end of the belt has sharp edges and is already scratching the belt...I had to Polish  the borders with a dremel ...a lot of work for what it supposed to be quality brand...look at the pictures...sad for Polo...who is losing quality 😔"
2.0,"If you have any chest at all this is not the dress for you. I'm not even that big in the chest, I'm a D and I got a large and I can't even wear the dress."
2.0,"I loved the coat but was disappointed because it was advertised  to have a front zipper, that was one of the main reasons for buying this particular jacket, I haven’t worn it still trying to decide to keep or send it back, if there is one with a front zipper I would like to exchange it"
2.0,I have purchased earrings from Ever Faith before and have always liked their earrings.  These were not up to par.  There is nothing wrong with them but the gem  part that dangles just looks cheap.  The color was of course beautiful and the earrings were the sized described and comfortable.  They just did not look anywhere near as good as the picture. I feel bad about saying this but I do feel that others need to know.
2.0,Some of the nose rings are so small they couldn't even be used on anyone.
2.0,"It fanned out at the bottom way more than what the picture shows. Other than that, it fits, there is just way to much fabric :(  I still like it okay and will wear it around the house and while hanging on the deck."
2.0,I really hate having a seam down the front of the shirt.  I wish it would have had more room in the shoulders and a little longer in the front and back.
2.0,This dress was super cute but extremely large. I ordered a small and it was XXL
2.0,Was not at all what I thought I was ordering. Looks absolutely nothing like the picture.
2.0,Earrings looked just like the picture shown. Was satisfied until stone separated from post after only a few wearings. Get what you pay for I suppose. 2 star rating is because earring fell apart.
2.0,Who knew these were kids sizes. WAY to small.
2.0,Looks more like a napkin ring. Might use it to tie back curtains of the same color.
2.0,much larger then expected
2.0,"This is a very interesting dress shape, i really like the print and upper body fit, but the hips were really big, so it gave me this weird pre-columbian pottery shape."
2.0,"I’m 6’ 210lbs, very active and the shirt fit snugly/well around the shoulders, chest and arms. However it is about 5” too long. Too bad. Unless your torso is longer than your legs, you’re 6’4” wear your shirts down to your knees or tuck them in avoid this. Nice buttons though."
2.0,Earrings didn’t come with backs :(
2.0,I like the style and color selection but two of the gray fobs were what I could best describe as powder when I opened the package. They also smell terrible. I don't see them lasting long but they do look good.
2.0,Didn’t like the fabric! Felt and looked very cheap! Didn’t wear and ran small!
2.0,"I obviously misjudged the term oversized to mean, somewhat bigger.  The body of this shirt is like a circus tent."
2.0,"Cute and not bad for the price. Just wanted to use it as a headband for my hair so you won’t see the snag/hole in the fabric, disappointing that the product was damaged right out of the bag."
2.0,"it does not work with my watch - the straps I'm trying to replace are quick release so this strap doesn't work, won't stay on."
2.0,"Cute on the toe, not cute enough for a finger. Doesn’t stay closed on toe, spins around. Cannot wear."
2.0,The shoes fit perfectly and the squeaker works well. But the material on the back is already is already cracking and coming off after the first 5 minutes of my little guy wearing them.
2.0,A lot longer than I expected it to be and looks kinda awkward on so I’ve never even worn it...
2.0,"First, the good. I love the design of this jacket and the golden yellow is an excellent color! The fit is stylish, not too baggy but also roomy enough for layers when necessary. I’ve worn it in a few downpours so far and it has performed very well as my waterproof outer layer while working outside!<br /><br />That being said, I’ve had a couple issue so far. The first one they sent had a non functional zipper on the left hand pocket. I requested a replacement, so no lasting issue there. However, I was rounding a corner today and the lightly bumped into it only to realize a few minutes later when my arm was starting to get wet that the material on my left sleeve had torn open! I want to be clear, I barely skimmed the corner and now have a 3’x3’ tear in the sleeve of my jacket. I want to love this jacket, but it’s simply not durable enough for me to be ready to replace it considering a light skimming of a slightly rugged corner resulted in such a large tear.<br /><br />Overall, I’d really like to rate this higher due to it’s stylishness and excellent waterproof performance but really can’t considering how flimsy the material turned out to be. I’d love to hear from the company on this and will update my review if anything changes."
2.0,Cute but WAY too small and very see through!!
2.0,Did I buy juniors size by accident? Seems like different material than pictured and just way too tight to be an average woman's (with breasts) large. Wanted it to be loose/comfy. Was definitely not.
2.0,They are big and just make everything tan
2.0,"I am 5'6"" with normal size legs and it came up 2 in over my knee cap. So thick I could not even get it around my ankle very easily."
2.0,Cute but don’t really adjust.
2.0,The material is more like a swim short nylon. Very stretchy but almost too heavy for everyday wear.
2.0,"No tiene micha utilidad,  no caben 100 lapices"
2.0,"Design on received product was much blurrier than the image, and was very itchy. While the insides of the arms were fleece lined they both had a large seam that makes it uncomfortable to wear, which is why I am returning it."
2.0,Not what you think it would be in person compared to the picture. It's not a cotton feel like the picture shows and it's soooooo wrinkle. Only a super skinny girl can wear this without making her look three times her size! It's bad. It's really bad. I'm sorry.
2.0,"You pay for what you get. While the shirt looks nice on the outside, I doubt it lasting more than two seasons max, the material is just super cheap and is pretty noticeable from a user stand point. You pay for what you get. Probable would not buy again though."
2.0,Cheap. Poorly made garbage. Fell apart coming out of the package.
2.0,Product fit well but the shirt had a hole cut in the back.
2.0,"Yikes. Feels almost gross to wear. Like silky satin...but not in a good way. Feels very, very poorly made and low quality. Wish I would have passed this one up. My son hasn’t worn it once due to the texture and I don’t really blame him. The size seemed a little small, as well."
2.0,Extremely small thought it would be at least medium size...
2.0,"Bracelet arrived on time and looked great, but as soon as my daughter put it on it broke."
2.0,The entire back is very sheer and see-through
2.0,"Me quedo súper grande y la costura es muy sencilla se está descosiendo,la calidad no muy buena 😭"
2.0,Cheap fabric. It works if your kid doesn’t know any better.
2.0,"The first time my husband wore the belt, the brown leather crackled around the buckle.  It looked like it was worn out.  It is poor quality."
2.0,Did not like the material. Not sweatshirt to me.
2.0,Product about 2 inches too small.  Sending back.
2.0,It was very large. The chapstick DOES NOT fit in the spot. It will easily fall out. I am returning these things right away.
2.0,Showering alone fogged up this watch to where you can’t read it. The picture was taken after being in recovery (a rice bag) for three days.
2.0,I love the top but the bottoms are rough and scratchy. Not what I want in pajamas.
2.0,These socks do NOT stay warm like advertised!  Very expensive and disappointed
2.0,Returned; Didn’t like the appearance.
2.0,"Super cute, but the material was weird and also holds sweat/stank after a few times of wearing it. I ended up going it away after wearing it less than 10 times."
2.0,Great idea but who has wrists that tiny.<br />Holy crap small<br />Very disappointing
2.0,Really cute shirt but it came with a hole in it.
2.0,"I love leggings! I have several pair. Many of them are faux leather. This pair is by far the worst looking ones I've ever purchased. Not at all like what's in the picture. First of all, the zipper is 11 1/2 inches long. It comes almost up to my knee. Not a good look at all.<br />Secondly, the material is very plastic feeling and I think would probably rip after maybe just a couple of wears. Definitely a waste of money. Don't make my mistake. Save your money for something better."
2.0,"They advertise this as a sweater, but it's just a shirt made of polyester material like a running shirt.  I was very disappointed, but my 5 year old grandson wanted to keep it."
2.0,It WAS very pretty when it came but turned colors 2days later
2.0,Could not get on. Way too small although I followed the sizing directions. Had to give it away.
2.0,These were fine and worked great until they ended up breaking like the first pair I had - plastic frame around the lens cracked.
2.0,"These were not a good fit for me. The material was not what I was expecting. The pants had a very course feeling against the skin, which can be very uncomfortable when the quality of the material is not great. The pants also ran very small. I returned them and got a different brand."
2.0,"These ultraviolet aviator sunglasses are one of the most unattractive sunglasses I own. The frames aren’t the best quality but they do feel sturdy enough for the occasional casual wear. The lenses on these sunglasses are huge and probably won’t work for most face shapes. For some reason the entire lens is not within the frame, both outer sides of the lens are hanging out while that portion of the frame is indented. The nose pad can be adjusted but I don’t recommend doing it more than once, since I don’t think the frame will hold up to constant bending. My favorite part is the case, which I plan to use with a different pair of glasses. If you like sunglasses with huge lenses, this might be worth a shot otherwise this is a total pass."
2.0,Not stretchy like the other solid color<br />Versions. Not comfy.
2.0,thought they were clip on but it turns out that they are not my mother can't wear them sad face
2.0,"The criss cross back is cute but very frustrating, the pads are lumpy, and it gave me a rash. Probably best for only people with a smaller chest"
2.0,Expected to be much larger
2.0,"Its ""one size fits all"" is a size XXXL its huge. If you want the smile on your face find another mask- this one is down below your chin & ON the bottom curve of the mask so it tucks under your face. Looks less like a smile more like a weird white beard bcz it doesn't show most of the smile.<br />HOWEVER! Its a good quality mask if you disregard it being gigantic & the poor design, the removable filter inserts are nice, the side strap adjustments seem strong & the elastic is soft.<br />Unfortunately it still an instant return from me."
2.0,"Product came from China.  Flower pendant is beautiful.  The chain breaks very easily.  Just taking it out of the plastic wrap it broke.  I fixed it and trying to pass it over my head it broke again.  Bad quality but you get what you pay for.  Cute piece, though!"
2.0,"It fit my boyfriend better than me, he has bigger ears, and then it broke a few days later, it was alright though."
2.0,"My son finally fits this, he wore it once, I washed it and now it looks like it is a year old it's so faded."
2.0,The boned bodice is decent fabric. Size runs small. Returning because skirt is cheap costume fabric full of sizing.
2.0,"They work as expected, but the clip on the inside of your jeans is bulky metal which may mark/scratch your chrome when pulling down kick stand on dismount."
2.0,"Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations, but when the description says ""elastic"" take it to mean ""super duper stretchy like waaaay beyond what you'd think"". I was expecting something with a little bit of give, not 30% stretch factor.  It seems well enough made, but the band is so stretchy that you can pull it over your hand - no real need for the clasp at all. That amount of stretch is just silly as a watch strap. I may keep the thing and re-purpose the hardware using a normal bit of nylon tape - not decided yet."
2.0,Not only the size was off but the overall quality looks very cheap.  I definitely wouldn't buy it again.  It's been more than a year and I was never able to wear them because it looks too crappy.
2.0,Didn't look like the picture much. Much more gawdy.
2.0,Way to small. I’m a 42 to 44 waist with 32 inseam. I couldn’t get these past my thighs. Xxl did not mean xxl
2.0,"Very cute pattern, but it is definitely sized on the smaller side. I normally wear a 2X in lounge pants and the largest size were very very snug. Sure, they made my butt look great! But all of my fluff came out the top and it was not flattering or comfortable to try and make it work. Besides...the material was kind of cheap (not surprising for cheap clothing).<br />Unfortunately, these had to go back. :(<br />My suggestion? If you're a fluffy girl, STAY AWAY. Do not be tempted by the cheap price!"
2.0,Looked good but was falling apart when it arrived
2.0,"These fit great and I was super happy. Until I wore them to one yoga class and tore a hole in the crotch. As I go commando for yoga, this was disastrous. I threw them away."
2.0,not quite as I expected but will keep this item
2.0,so i bought this for a friend and they broke so
2.0,The only thing near the size was the length
2.0,I love how they match my earings. The only problem that the necklace is it's super tiny and u eso8the Fatma.
2.0,"It's a nice looking hat. But if you want a Red, WHITE & Blue hat don't get it since it's a Red, TAN & Blue hat."
2.0,"The dress material is very thin and cheap feeling. The top part was very loose, but the waist was a little snug. Very odd fit. I normally wear a size small, 34C bra, and size 26 waist, for reference."
2.0,Cuffs started to unthread within two weeks. Completely unacceptable. I guess that's what you get with an inexpensive product.
2.0,Fits great. But...It is hard to breathe with it on. I have to pull it down multiple times to catch a breath. Image is ok.
2.0,wish I had not purchased. Loose fit and ugly
2.0,"We received the dress, it was beautiful, the material was nice, but when my daughter tried it on I noticed something was wrong in several places. The seams were out in several spots. So if you order this dress make sure you thoroughly check the seams."
2.0,"The Buckles will not lock belt material in place, you have to have the Tri-Slide Buckles to hold the belt."
2.0,"It was paper thin, I can't imagine it being classified as waterproof  Also, it doesn't hang on the body the way it looks in the photos."
2.0,"The first time you wear them they’re beautiful. Wash them and the fabric is VERY WRINKLY! And they’re too delicate of a material to iron. But… iron pajamas? No way, not me."
2.0,Cute yet the charms fall out frequently
2.0,"Why does the watch say water resistant yet, the instructions say do not get it wet?  Don't buy if you plan on using it in water."
2.0,It is way too awful looking.<br />And it is not as pictured. Also size is little bigger than regular size.<br />We had to return it.
2.0,"Looked pretty good, just way.....way to small."
2.0,I returned this. The material was ok but the style of the shirt wasn't very shapely and the sleeves were too tight and too high
2.0,"This belt is very narrow, and way too long, like borderline obnoxiously long."
2.0,"It isn't so much that it is too small, it is just a really strange proportion for me. The waist come up too high, and it makes me look pregnant. If you have no torso, this is probably the perfect dress for you!"
2.0,Zipper keeps falling off when I go to get my change out. Hook that attached the wallet to the wrist part broke. I'd save up and invest in a better quality one..
2.0,Didn't work on a ring that I had lost that was Sterling Sterling that was very tarnished. Tried multiple times and returned.
2.0,"I’m five nine, this dress came above my ankle...disappointing because the rest of the dress was beautiful"
2.0,Loved the shoe- they fit perfectly and was excited for daughter to use them this summer at the pool. Returning them due to smell- holy hell they reek to high heaven like some kind of toxic chemical. Was too nervous to have little one wear them if they were that offensive.
2.0,Items seemed to be good quality. However the ears and tail are much smaller than they appear to be in the picture.
2.0,"It was cheaply made and the strap broke when I washed it. There were no washing instructions, so I assumed normal wash. It was too short for my liking. I don't recommend this."
2.0,Slips down a lot and the stitching came undone after a couple wears
2.0,"I bought this scarf in the light pink orange color. I wanted a soft, light, feminine scarf to walk on the beach with. I am 5'8&#34; and pretty lean. I recently got a pixie cut so I wanted to keep my neck warm without breaking out my winter gear. When I received the scarf, the fabric was soft and light and the pattern was feminine. I unfolded the scarf from its little plastic pouch and was overwhelmed. This scarf puts the infinity in infinity scarf! There was so much fabric!! Well, I tried it on, hoping that somehow once it was around my neck the fabric would lay like it does in Amazon's picture. No luck. I was lost in a mound of pink fabric on my shoulders. You couldn't even see my neck! So I went to take it off but I couldn't find the loop to take it off. I had to wade through the fabric to find the loop. My friend who was watching me this whole time started making suggestions, like, &#34;If you cut it in half, then this wouldn't happen. Plus you'd have two scarves!&#34; or &#34;This would work as a skirt. You would make this into a skirt quite easily.&#34; I have no sewing skills so that wasn't going to happen. I finally removed the scarf from my neck and printed off a return label."
2.0,"There is not a ""U"" loop like in the picture that rests in the ear lobe.<br />It is just a long chain to pull through the ear pearcing.<br />Kind of weird, ok but not good, not worth returning :-("
2.0,"It was alright, but my husband didn’t like the “dainty” clasp as he’s a bigger physical man. Said he knew if he wore it he would break it in the first few hours."
2.0,"Fits good but looks NOTHING like the picture.<br />Will be wearing for workouts still, but very disappointed"
2.0,Beautiful but doesn't fit my ring
2.0,"I only wore it for 5 days and one of them doesn't screw. I was in love with them, but  it's not worth the price I paid for."
2.0,Smaller than a normal medium and more of a muscle tank than a standard tank top. Returned it.
2.0,"I'm glad these glasses came in a two pack.  I put the first pair on to check the fit and when I removed them, the arm broke! I didn't have them on for 30 seconds!  Very disappointed.  But, the other pair has done well and I wear them every day."
2.0,I thought the fabric would be more cloth-like. It's more of a compression kind of material.
2.0,Had to give to my tern way to small.
2.0,"Was disappointed when I received it , some of the stones had fallen out and were loose in the bag."
2.0,So the body of the dress is too large and the arms of the dress are too small.  This is so frustrating.  Anything I order from overseas never fits right.  The arms need about two more inches of fabric to fit right and the body needs to be brought in two inches.  Last time I order anything from overseas.
2.0,For a pair of gloves that claim that they are a help to your joints and hands the pair that I have have had to be some 3 different places a repair of this seems I would say that this is disappointing but nevertheless it is something that you have to just deal with send me another pair Tommy
2.0,this was cute at first but then all pieces broke off after a few wears
2.0,They are pretty decent but get holes easily.
2.0,"This runs pretty large and is square shaped rather than fitted or tapered. The material is stretchy and cheap, a little shiny."
2.0,I bought this for my sister but it just didn't fit her as she thought it would. The dress itself looked decent though.
2.0,I ordered an XL size and the pants were tagged XL. They fit like medium size. No way was I getting those on. I had to return it.
2.0,"Don't fit a mans foot.  I washed them first.  They are just a footie, not a sock.  Sorry my fault, was thinking it was an anklet.  Not so, just a footie.  Small, tight, elastic."
2.0,Dress didn’t fit it very pretty but it’s a lot of trouble returning or replacing still working on it a month and a half later…
2.0,"Very cute, but run small. The belt also was smaller than the waist."
2.0,"I think I must have received a damaged or defective band. The color was way off from the picture and looks dirty or old. There were strange spots and kinks in the metal. I couldn’t get the case part around the watch face no matter what I did. Worst of all it was way too big, even at its smallest adjustment and I have pretty average size wrists."
2.0,It would have been nice to know it runs very small. I can’t wear it on the finger I bought it for. It’s always worth spending a little more money. You get what you pay for.
2.0,I thought I was ordering an adult hat. This thing barely fit me and DEFINITELY did not fit my husband whom has hair. It's warm but too small.
2.0,They are a little big. My biggest complaint is they aren’t very soft for sleeping and after one was they have faded so bad the look 10 years old.
2.0,Photo looked really cute but I found it was a little short.
2.0,"It’s a very nice looking set, but my girl really doesn’t like how the long sleeve piece feels against her skin, so she refuses to wear it. She is fine with her other long sleeve bathing suits, just this one she feels itchy and uncomfortable wearing. The other two parts of the set she likes, but they don’t really protect her from the sun, so, kind of waste of money"
2.0,These were sewn strangely & will be getting returned.  It was hard to get your fingers all the way in.
2.0,The colors and the fabric are much cheaper quality in real life than it appears in the pictures. Returned item.
2.0,Purchased through amazon March 2020.......frame completely broken and non useable Dec 2020......Nooz website says must work through Amazon for refund/replacement.  Who at Amazon do I contact?
2.0,"I want to love these shoes. They are so cute, for great, easy for my kid to get on and off, but the quality is terrible. In less than two weeks of wear the fabric is fraying and coming apart. I was hoping to have found the shoe brand for us in this shoe, but I can’t deal with it completely falling apart in such a short time frame. Bummed out about that for sure."
2.0,So pretty in person! I’ve gotten so many compliments on it!!<br /><br />Edited: ring is starting to tarnish bad just from normal wear. I don’t even wear it daily.
2.0,"Design looks like the picture, but not what I consider a lanyard.  This is just one long piece of elastic with a crappy hook at the end.  Plus it's not connected right, and the design isn't visible on both sides.  I probably won't ever use it for keys like I intended..."
2.0,"These fit nicely and felt comfortable. Unfortunately, the right leg had a hole in the seam upon arrival, so had to return for a refund. Otherwise would have worked well for a post partum woman."
2.0,Tops way too small for my legs.  They are so small and tight that they can cause blood clots.the tops are for small children not adults.  Otherwise seem to be of good construction tion.
2.0,"Extremely small, order up two sizes if purchasing."
2.0,"I ordered for my daughter, and the threads on the back popped apart. It is not too small."
2.0,Beautiful earrings and love the concept but they just didn't fit on my ears very well and they hurt.  I gave them to a friend who liked them.
2.0,But a true sandal in the sense that there is no heel strap.  As a result product easily comes off.
2.0,"quick delivery and seems to be good quality...however, I bought this for my son to use with the &#34;Sugarloaf&#34; helm I bought for him at Christmas. He cannot wear the helm with the coif and this padded arming cap, everything together is too much material. So, it's wear the coif without the helm or without the arming cap."
2.0,Ordered a 20mm must have been sent a 22mm bc they were so big.  Had planned to wear them today but couldn't.
2.0,Smaller and shorter than expected.
2.0,"I bought this to ugly up for a Christmas party, but it's just too tight, even going a size up. Super tight along the chest and belly. Cheap, scratchy material. Wasn't expecting much for what I paid but even calling this a ""sweater"" is pushing it!"
2.0,"They weren’t super baggy, but they were looser than pictured. They appear to be tighter on your body based on the product images, but in reality they fit like sweats, loose sweats. Wouldn’t recommend if you're looking for something to show off your legs, or something that actually matches the product images."
2.0,"Really nice dress but it didn't fit. I normally wear Medium and so that's what I got, 34B with hour glass figure,and it didn't fit. I am returning the medium and getting a large to see if it fits better"
2.0,Very pretty but I couldn't lift my arms. Looked great when my arms are down- I noticed the model never raised hers! I ordered an extra small which fit great on the sides. I thought about going up a size but that would have been too big on the sides. Plus it was semi see-through. I returned it.
2.0,Socks stated the sizes were the same but one is diffinately higher than the other.
2.0,Watch would not charge and then stopped working. I would not recommend purchasing. A vtech one would last much longer.
2.0,"I was hoping this was less sheer, like what is pictured in the photo.  It is cute, just a little too revealing for me."
2.0,Me gusta como se ve la cartera pero el material es malo se rompe con facilidad y se daña rápido
2.0,Ordered an extra large it fits like a medium
2.0,I ordered a 12 but a size 10 was sent. Even the 10 was falling off my child who in other brands is between a 12 and 14. Extremely large sizing. We haven't bought this brand in years and now I remember why. Their sizing is not like other brands. You always need to order a couple sizes down.
2.0,"I actually really like this shirt, but I'm giving a two-star rating because it's WAY too thin. It doesn't look like it in the picture, but that's because I had to really search through my closet for a spaghetti strap top that could go underneath it. You even have to be careful with that since this shirt will show nearly all of the outlines of any top you wear under it. Also, the arms of this top are too big to me. It will show too much of your bra straps, bra cups, and side boob, especially if you don't plan on wearing a jacket or cardigan over it. Luckily my tank top's color matched with the rest of my outfit. Otherwise, I'd HAVE to either always wear a tank top that matches or a jacket to cover my exposed bra in the arm openings"
2.0,Pretty dress but the color does not match the picture.
2.0,"Loved the look, but too small to put anything in."
2.0,"I didn’t like the material, looks too cheap"
2.0,Fits as expected except the length. The picture makes it look like a tee shirt fit but it hits right at the waist line. Really wish it was 2 or 3 inches longer. If it helps my torso is not long at all.
2.0,Not the best quality. Tough to pull apart
2.0,Top fits great but bottom no true to size.
2.0,"Odd shape. Made for a curvy figure, not a small child."
2.0,"The front of the shirt it too short, like a high low shirt, I like my shirts longer in the front, so it’s personal preference, besides that it’s good"
2.0,It was to snug for a 12 / 14 size L
2.0,"the dress was perfect...until i washed it.  i washed on delicate, cold and hung to dry, but the inside seam still began to fray around the buttons and it shrunk regardless.  if you buy this dress, but a size up if you plan to wash it.  it was a beautiful dress that i got one wear out of."
2.0,Hat was purchased as unisex but would only fit a women or child. Hat was too small for adult male
2.0,"I purchased this dress as a casual summer work dress. I am 5'7"" 130lbs. I ordered the small. I could hardly get the thing on! It was so tight. Definitely recommend sizing up. I ordered this in the blue and the color was beautiful and vibrant. It was just way too tight."
2.0,"Well, this pair of earrings is way smaller than I expected. My earlobes are probably average in thickness and these earrings barely fit. I guess it depends where on the ear they are placed. Therefore, these earrings may have fit better if placed further up towards the top, but that’s not what I needed them for. I wanted earrings for the first hole on the bottom of my earlobes.<br /><br />For anyone with thicker than average earlobes or nostrils, these won’t fit. The flat part that goes through the hole is very thin and not that long either, which is why it took me like ten minutes to put them in. I don’t have long finger nails either, but if so, it would be too difficult to put these in at all.<br /><br />While getting ready for work, there’s not a whole lot of extra time for me to play around with earrings. Fortunately, I received this pair of earrings on a weekend and had some extra time to put them in before going anywhere.<br /><br />On the other hand, I fell asleep while wearing these earrings and woke up not even realizing they were there! Most of the time, I wake up during the night to take out any jewelry. So, these earrings can be that regular pair I wear, for a few days or a whole weekend, without taking them out.<br /><br />However, the main purposes for buying these earrings was to have something conservative to wear to work and to look more “done” in my appearance.  My work environment is very conservative and being around kids all day, I didn’t want something in my ears that is too big or heavy. Although these earrings are really small, they do add a little something to my outfits and are better than wearing nothing at all.<br /><br />Also, I normally order silver in all of my jewelry, but instead tried the gold and am really glad that I did because it’s a nice change. It’s nice to have a balance of gold and silver jewelry to alternate throughout the week. As for that tiny stud on these earrings, as seen in the original post online, is not at all noticeable (as seen in MY photos).<br /><br />Lastly, the box these earrings arrived in had a small black hair in it and that was really gross, especially in the post-Covid era. I think this pair in my order was a returned item or repackaged or perhaps not and it was just a packaging flaw.  I don’t know how that black hair got in a small black box that the pair of earrings arrived in, but I know for sure it’s not mine, since I am a blonde!<br /><br />Over all, my expectations weren’t that high to begin with because I know the price is pretty low for earrings made of 14K gold. You do get what you pay for! However, the photos of these earrings originally published online, were misleading and made me believe that they were far larger than they actually are in reality. For that and the packaging flaw, is why my rating is low."
2.0,size is not as indicated.
2.0,I'm extremely disappointed considering it took over a month to receive my jewelry & when I finally did they were not the correct size. I ordered an 18g and received a 16g which is far too thick for my piercings.
2.0,"Although long it's nothing like the picture and looks nothing like the picture. All that beautiful ruching that you see that makes you want to purchase it is not on the actual dress and the material is more like sweatshirt material, not like whatever is shown."
2.0,The finishing is very cheap- the ruffle edges have a very coarse purl stitching so it looks like a dollar store scarf. Better workmanship would make this a wearable dress.
2.0,"This bag was beautiful but so small I couldn't get my wallet in it, had to go back :("
2.0,"This was super cute and I wanted to love it. I ordered the XL based on their size chart, but it was way too small. I wear a size 12, but it felt more like an 8 or maybe even a 6. So if you are over a size 6 I would be wary about ordering this."
2.0,"This dress for weirdly. It was much too tight in the armpits, I could barely pull it off as it stuck. It was big and very baggy everywhere else. Maybe I just have a weird shape.  I returned it and had no issues getting a refund."
2.0,"Beautiful earrings but more fragile than I expected.  This is coming from someone who had the same pair of sterling silver hoops (not these) for over five years before they broke.  Ordered one pair of these, loved them, but then they got ruined in airport security.  Replaced them with a second pair but, through no fault of my own, the lever on the fastener just snapped off, like it suddenly became brittle.  I really like these earrings, but I can't bring myself to buy a third pair of them."
2.0,I have only had this bracelet for a few weeks and it is starting to unravel already . Would like a replacement or refund.
2.0,Failed my expectation
2.0,lost the day I put it on.
2.0,The material of the shirt was very nice however the sizing is off. I ordered a 2X when I put on the shirt it fit more like a large. unfortunately had to return all of the 6 shirts i ordered.
2.0,Extremely small.  More suited for a toddler.
2.0,I must of overread that these are high wasted. I would of never ordered them. Returned
2.0,Says it should fit pretty much all 22 mm smart watches including my zenwatch. But it doesnt. One side it too big. And the otherside just barely barely fits. Which is just due to bad manufacturing.
2.0,"It looks much thicker on Amazon, but when you get this little anorexic band, the watch body looks completely out of proportion.  In My Humble Opinion Only.  I was just hoping for a more beefy silicone / rubber watch band."
2.0,"Great color and price, which is why I bought it, but the headband is very itchy, and mine came with a couple flaws in the structured part above the bill."
2.0,The belt loop is falling off and the fabric feels rather cheap for the price
2.0,Pants were not as picture. Jacket nice.
2.0,I love the style of this dress but the material of the dress is a thin jersey that is clingy. So if you are planning on wearing bike shorts or anything like a camisole under the dress the lines of that will definitely show through the dress.
2.0,They were way to small and narrow.
2.0,Price was good but some of the colors came damaged.  Like the quality control wasn’t there.  But we got a lot so we just pitched the messed up ones and used the ones not damaged.
2.0,Should have listened to the reviews! This was enormous on me and there was just no way to fix that with the belt. Had to return.
2.0,"The print is a darker and definitely blurrier then expected. I’m not a thin person and have a big rib cage and yet I’m still far from filling out this tank. Would of liked it to have been more fitting like the pictures. But, it was cheap and delivered fast."
2.0,"Nice hat but definitely NOT slouchy! This is a classic, snug fit beanie."
2.0,Too short for me but I like to wear them around the house and to sleep in.
2.0,Not even close to right size.
2.0,"The dress fit very weird. It was fine around the waist and bust but the actual dress (not including the fringe part) was very short. It did not cover my butt fully and would not look good even if I wore tights with it. The turtleneck part also fit odd. It was pretty loose around my neck and just looked weird. But this was just on me. My sister (same size as me) got the same dress but in purple and it looked really good on her. But for me, I ended up returning it."
2.0,It’s beautiful! Just as pictured! THERE WAS ONLY ONE! These are clearly displayed as a SET! This is seriously irritating and I’ve bought from this seller before and yet to be disappointed until now. I need a proper set for my kit so I’ll be ordering another assuming it’s only one... SERIOUSLY irritated with the false advertising.
2.0,Stunk after dry cleaning
2.0,The sound and speakers volume is too low
2.0,"I liked the price; but these were stiff and rubbed the top and sides of my feet. The sole thickness was okay, but they don't cushion as well as another brand I have."
2.0,The top fits really weird--it looks like the bikini is upside down. Does not resemble the picture at all. Returning it
2.0,"The shoe quality was fine, however I received two right shoes. No time to return them as this was an emergency order and family picture day was the next day. Used them for that purpose (worked out fine) but cannot use them again which sucks because they are so pretty sturdy and sparkly."
2.0,"Hardware is silver, not gold as expected. Gave as a gift and the recipient was upset."
2.0,The sizing on this was to be desired. I bought it for a backless dress but had an extremely difficult time even loosening the straps! The size is not correct so bigger chests beware!
2.0,Wayyyy too small & tight.
2.0,Print on shirt is not very sharp color around words looks like it ran.
2.0,Loved this dress and the color but I received it with a rip at the pocket so had to send it back.
2.0,The color is not iridescent as it seems in the photo. It's more pink on one side and blue/lavender-ish on the other.
2.0,It did not come with all pieces. Missing the matching cuff links. Very disappointing that I have to order those seperate now.
2.0,Low rise and short length don't work together. I'm 10/12 and ordered the XL. Might look ok if you've got a totally flat belly.
2.0,Hole near the crotch during firs use.  Bad quality.<br />Too bad because the design and colors are pretty.<br />Bought for my 11 year old son.
2.0,"Stone is beautiful, bracelet looks nothing like the picture"
2.0,ad was 11 and showed up as 10 to 11 size
2.0,"The jeans fit fine and look great, but the pockets are way too small/tight. I can barely fit my hand in the pockets.... Were these made for people that are malnourished?"
2.0,I'm a size 10 and this fits really small for a one size fits all. Very thin material.  It is nice and stretchy.  Not much support for 36C.
2.0,"really flimsy, not good for winter, to expensive for what you get"
2.0,Glass piece on the right hand side pops off easily
2.0,Bought XL and fits like Med. Had to return.
2.0,"I bought one of these for a Spellbound routine and wasn't impressed. Made of plastic and the edges are smooth thus very hard to grip. It's a pretty enough coin, but the light weight and un-milled edges are a definite deterrent for sleight of hand."
2.0,"My daughter is size 12 month. We tried 6-12 & it was too large, so I ordered a 0-3 month & it was still too large. Ended up returning both. Wish it worked out because it’s so cute!"
2.0,I ordered this dress in two colors bc I loved the look of it. I got them and they are very cheaply made and entirely too small. I went by the size chart but was very disappointed in the actual product
2.0,Not happy. Just opened these as I am making items for a craft show and so far 3 out of 10 chains do not close. The clasp gets stuck. Can't use any chain that doesn't close on its own.
2.0,Not the quality or color as shown in the photo but I'm just glad it's beige and not dark brown like others were complaining about. It's quite thin and flimsy looking and feeling. I just hope it keeps me warm...
2.0,Much too small to be called large
2.0,They began to unravel after the first wearing. Hem completely gone off one sleeve.
2.0,The balls feel very large. Also the purple/blue sparkle one is very pretty.  However the first time I wore it the glitter started to come off. It rubbed the inside of my mouth. I had to throw it away.
2.0,"The design is cute. The shorts part fit nicely, but the top part was huge. I returned and got a refund."
2.0,Description says that your eyes aren't visible through the black chrome mirrorshield but that's very false. I also expected them to be a bit darker but they seem to transmit quite a bit more light than my original Oakley lenses. On a good note the clarity is very good!
2.0,Purchased for my daughters birthday outfit. Looked nice however they were ruined after 1 wash
2.0,"I liked the material it was soft and comfy. However, overall I was disappointed.  The high waist kept rolling down.  The pants fit weird... never had pants that were both baggy in the crotch area and have a print.  Maybe I'm just used to having a seam.... or because I have a shorter torso.  I ordered 2 pair, returned one."
2.0,This was shorter than I had hoped 😕
2.0,"Too small for adults. We had to stretch them which left strings hanging, smh not worth the money."
2.0,"These are extremely loose shorts.  While the waist sizing is OK, the amount of material in the butt and legs is enough for a guy twice my size.  I won't be buying these again."
2.0,"Bracelet looks nice, but fits small"
2.0,This was not the scarf that I ordered. I was looking at the elephant and received a heart. I was very disappointed on the receipt of this scarf.
2.0,"I even ordered a size up but my wife could barely squeeze into these. She’s not tall and not skinny and I’ve gotten use to clothes not fitting as expected. But I’ve gotten good at figuring out what will work and what won’t. I actually ordered my wife numerous pajamas, lingerie sets, clothes and shoes this Christmas. And this is the only thing that didn’t fit as expected.<br /><br />Obviously for the price, you’re not expecting the best quality product. Which in general, these aren’t. But that would have been fine if the sizing wasn’t so far off.<br /><br />Can’t recommend."
2.0,These are adorable. BUT within a week both buckles broke. Requested a replacement which went smoothly but a week after the replacements those buckles also broke. So it's not worth it
2.0,Cute shirt but definitely the wrong size. I ordered a 2x and its more like a small or xs...
2.0,It sucks so I went to walmart to get one.
2.0,"Cheap feel to them.. I got two pair on QVC that were the same brand as these but the quality from the QVC glasses is 1000% better. I thought I was getting the same thing, since QVC didn't carry them anymore. but they feel like $5.00 sunglasses from Walmart."
2.0,"I bought a large which fits ok, but the top was too small.  I ended up returning it"
2.0,It came exactly as depicted. Only issue is the back irritated my neck a lot and it just hurt a lot to wear
2.0,It showed up damaged I won’t be back as a customer
2.0,"I got the ""Of course I talk to myself shirt.."" but when I'm trying to do my review it keeps coming up with the ""I paused my game to be here""... But based on the quality of the shirt I bought, that one probably is just as bad. I got an XL. It was skin tight on my husband and see through. I'm 5'5"" and 120lbs and it fits me perfectly. Don't bother with this shirt. It's cheap fabric. At least it's funny."
2.0,Much bigger than expected.  Never wore
2.0,"I didn't think it'd be the stretchy, shiny material and I don't like that.  The shirt is snug. The color is not what I ordered either.  Haven't tried on the pants yet, but they seem small too.  It's not a real, African garment whatsoever...especially when you see it's made and shipped from China which you won't see until after the fact and you see where it's shipped from.  Huge mistake.  The coloring on the items looks like it has run a bit and the seams are iffy.  I only give it 2 stars because I will use them as pajamas.  I really want to return it but it took forever to receive so I'm sure it'll take forever, if at all, for a refund."
2.0,There was no way these were going to fit on my dad’s legs even though we measured carefully and ordered according to their sizing.  Returned them.
2.0,"To small for me had to send it back, sizes run really small"
2.0,"Look nice and feel good. The interchangable lenses are the best part. Although, the glass broke after two uses. I guess you get what you paid for."
2.0,Looks nice but one of the buttons popped off as soon as I took hat out of package. They are now sewn on but glued on with a glue gun
2.0,"Too tight, but I am that size for all other brands...."
2.0,Screw came out 2 hours after receiving them.
2.0,My daughter had these on less than an hour and the unicorn already started peeling off.
2.0,Medium was a little too tight and not long enough to cover my butt. I returned it and ordered an XL. The fit is better on the top but not by much and it still falls just below my butt so there’s absolutely no bending room. There’s no flapper sway in this dress at all.
2.0,Like the bracelet but wouldn't clasp together and stay fastened
2.0,The shirt was okay but if you’re a girl and you have you know boobs the bts logo on the front kinda just goes inside your armpit or towards the side of my chest and you can’t see it. At least it was for me hahah. And if your a plus size girl like me I don’t recommend buying this shirt.
2.0,Jacket is super undersized XXL fits like a Medium
2.0,Some of the sets had really poor cutting and were warped.
2.0,I’m usually a size small but I ordered a large based on the reviews. The large was way too big on me. Just ordered a small in hopes that they actually fit because they’re super cute.
2.0,Had to send back and reordered twice to get them to fit. To have frustrations order 2 sizes larger than what you usually wear
2.0,Turned after first time wearing it
2.0,"These are annoyingly unimpressive. At least two of the clasps fell off and at least 4 of the 8 don't fit my neck. And not necessarily because my neck is small, but because the necklaces are huge. Oh, and one of them smelled like straight up body odor when I pulled it out of the package. Nice.<br /><br />I know these were cheap, but I expected to be able to wear more than 2 of them."
2.0,"Think of an Inexpensive basic black hat with a tiny, iron-on decal. The decal is thin, see-through and small."
2.0,Stretchy material and it was printed.  Color and print looked awful.
2.0,"I purchased these golf sleeves to wear at work to cover a full sleeve tattoo that I just started. I work at a preschool in Florida and we take the kids outside during the (hot) afternoons, so I needed a cooler option than wearing a long sleeved shirt underneath my work shirt.<br />The first day I wore them, I was very excited. They felt nice (second-skin feel), they stayed up fairly well (even though I have skinny arms), and they weren't too hot (I could actually feel air movement through the fabric). My only complaint on my first day of use was that the wrist part was not fitted (i have very skinny arms) and the sleeve was slightly too short for my arm, so I had to keep pulling it down to fully cover my tattoo.<br />The next day, I wore them again and noticed that the stitching in the wrist on one of them was starting to unravel. It got caught on something and pulled like pantyhose, it's never ending, there is now always a string hanging and the wrist looks all frazzled.<br />By the third (and last day I will ever wear them) they were falling down, riding up, and unraveling so much, I took them off and wore a sweater for the rest of the day.<br />I don't know if these would work better for someone whose arms aren't as skinny as mine, but regardless, they should not unravel on the second day of wear."
2.0,Needed it to be the color of the one in the pic but it’s definitely not and is very pink
2.0,Nice at first.. my son used for 2 weeks than it feel apart.
2.0,Over Priced
2.0,Not expensive but after one wear you will not be able to wear the dress again
2.0,"I loved this until I had to jeep tightening it all day, cheap not worth the $8"
2.0,This shirt does not look nice in person. I'm a size 4 with a larger chest I ordered a small and it was too big. Overall did not like the look so I returned it.
2.0,these were nice but the mens one seemed pretty flimsy
2.0,"A few weeks ago I purchased a pair of the Power Flex Capri 17 inch and loved them. The fabric was super soft and the quality was great. I immediately came back to Amazon to order a few more pairs. The problem was that there was a very limited color selection with the 17 inch capris so I decided to get these, the 22 inch. I ordered one black and one charcoal in XS (the same size I ordered the 17 inch in). They arrived today and I was surprised to see they are so different. First, the fabric is rigid and not as stretchy as the 17 inch; it feels like the material you'd ecpect to find on a cheap pair of workout pants--definitely not the super soft, four way stretch fabric that the 17 inch capris were made with. As a result, the XS barely fit. The lack of stretch made it feel like I was pulling on skinny jeans, not workout capris. It was just too uncomfortable to keep. I returned both pairs. Note I went back on over to the 17 inch Capri and order two pairs. They don't come in black or charcoal, but the quality level surpasses these completely."
2.0,This case is not as nice as it should be for the price. I wouldn't even have paid the sale price for this item. The inside feels flimsy and the hardware on the outside is cheap.
2.0,"This dress was not flattering at all. Too loose in all the wrong places, made me look boxy and I'm pretty curvy. Made my boobs look terrible. The color was pretty though. It just looked very cheap and not designed well. If it actually hugged you in the right places this would work but it doesn't."
2.0,These are cute and would be perfect if they were designed (length wise) with women 5’5” and taller in mind. The pants stop at mid calve for me. No bueno.
2.0,"I purchased these because they looked cool. I like the rose gold color. But they look cheap, not cool. Oh well."
2.0,"I received the cat beanie, however its not like the one posted on the picture."
2.0,I didn’t read what this shirt was made with. It’s basically a spandex shirt. It feels like I’m wearing a trash bag. My mistake for not reading. The shirt looked good so I bought it. Not again.
2.0,I'm 5'8&#34;<br />It cuts into my shoulders and I ended up throwing it away. This trainer should probably only be for 5'6&#34; or less and does not have extra fluff in the back region.<br />Will be buying a waist trainer without straps.
2.0,"Should have read the reviews before purchasing. First, the mask itself is thin mesh, totally useless on its own. The carbon filter doesn't line up properly, but does settle where it needs to be, after locking in place. The vents really do defeat the purpose of the mask at this point. You are in fact breathing in unfiltered air. The profile of the mask is not pleasing at all, you look like you have a beak on your face. Maybe slightly trimming the fabric and re-stitching it would help, but you don't buy finished products to have to make changes to them. The ear loops help more than the velcro closure, since the velcro sits at the base of the skull, it actually moves the mask downward. But atleast it makes a snug fit."
2.0,"In the paintball world, we all love the look of HK Army gear, and don’t get me wrong, “HHHHH!” has some of the best looking stuff in the game. But my problem with a lot of HK stuff is that it suffers from poor build quality. I had these pants for a year now and they ripped in numerous spots for me. I’m a snake player so i do dive around a lot but come on, it’s paintball not salsa dancing! I expect these paints to hold up! In addition, the lettering/decals on the paints started to peel/fray only after about 6 months.<br /><br />I would avoid these pants since they’re not durable enough for the price. I’d recommend the Planet Eclipse Program pants over these. They’re built a lot better and still lightweight. I rock those now and they’re much better."
2.0,"Cute dress, but super large. In the picture, you can't tell but the sleeves are extremely wide."
2.0,It was not as pictured. Was glossier. I think it would have looked a lot better if it was just like the picture.
2.0,"Looks nice but the fabric is very cheap, feels like you’re wear plastic fibers."
2.0,After one wear and wash in cold water the fabric was faded and fuzzy.
2.0,CALZADO DURO PARA LOS NIÑOS
2.0,"Was not true to size, even with measurements. The cut was ill-fitting and much to big on me."
2.0,This is a cheap product.  It's maybe worth $5.00<br /><br />DO N)T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!<br />you can do better on Ebay
2.0,I don't really like the way these look on my feet; they look better in pictures than on....
2.0,"Sizing didn't make sense, too large to where the top part just kept falling. No rubber backing to keep it held up."
2.0,"Like everyone else said. NOT THE ONE PICTURED!! Change the stupid picture! I should have read reviews... If you are trying to make Leatherface's Poulan 245A, the pictured one is way closer. The pull handle and round thing it's attached to in the picture, are not on the one you get. It's square, with a spherical knob. I had to go to a mower and saw shop and get parts, cut the old knob off and fill it in with Aves epoxy sculpt. The saw is also very quiet. I hear the older one by Gimmie is much louder than this Rubie's branded one. I guess after my paint job and parts it looks decent, but be prepared to work on this if you want your Leatherface costume to look good.."
2.0,"I wear a size 14 and bought these sandals for casual, warm weather.  Although the length of the ""shoe"" is correct, the straps would fit around a large bologna sausage...they are way too loose to fit; correspondingly, they fly off my feet as I walk."
2.0,"I was hoping these would look nice but the pearl effect is just too plastic and the ""gold"" looks plastic as well."
2.0,"waist was too small,i didn't like the material, I thought it was cotton,i didn't check first"
2.0,"loose fit, would not stay firm if you are riding with any wind, good for novelty or hair scrunchy but not for useful face cover on the ATV"
2.0,"The foam cups do not stay down, they keep moving up so the bust looks unnatural. Worse than this is the bottom since I have a full butt and it only covers half of my bottom, cutting halfway up my cheeks. My $10 swim suit I bought from Walmart 20 yrs ago fits better than this."
2.0,"Not all that happy with it. Seems cheap, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Although the look and size of the band was nice (even for my larger-wrists!) the clasp was very easy to come undone, which made me nearly lose my watch a couple of times."
2.0,sizes all wrong
2.0,Cute glasses but they are very loose and flimsy.
2.0,"Here's my story ...  Open the package and found a beautiful red bag and enclosed was one earring!! Not two (: you must laugh or you will cry !!  Would I recommend yes ,based off the one I received very nice.  I dislike when people write a review and say "" you get what you pay for"" yes that's correct however, for the price knew I was not dealing with a diamond store !! SLYN2599."
2.0,"This one is not for me. The bottoms fit fine if you like the high waist look but be warned, they are pretty cheeky. I think they may even have more fabric coverage in the front than back. The top had a weird fit. I like my tank top/sports bra style suits to fit snug up top so the girls are contained, but this one fit me strange. It felt fine around my arms and boobs, but is uncomfortably tight around my rib cage, and it doesn’t matter if the little front tie is tied or not. This one is going in a give away pile because the fit is just off for my frame. The only nice thing I can say about it is that I like the print. Overall, I cannot recommend it - it is the most uncomfortable suit I’ve tried in years and fwiw I typically have good luck online shopping for swim suits. For reference, rn I’m 5’5, 168lbs and 36DD."
2.0,Usually wear an 8 N. But these fit my mom who wears a 6 1/2 N
2.0,"They Said one size fits all, should have said one size fits small.  Also its hard to buckle, not happy!"
2.0,"Baggy, unflattering and too large"
2.0,Very very thin fabric !  Had to send back.
2.0,"The inside is not flannel as well, just the outside.  Little disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Took 2 months to receive earings. The colour of manufacturer stone not close  to pictured. Very dark
2.0,I have ordered two pairs and the seam on the but has started coming apart on two individual pants. Maybe I got a size too small or maybe it is a bad batch. I will be returning both of the ones I have presently but will try one more time on a size larger.
2.0,"Not as big as i was hoping, and it comes with the secondhand ticking. Not sure how long the battery will last now, but definitely not worth the price in my opinion."
2.0,"one of the ear holders was not moving properly, going out of the country the next day, it broke during trip.  Looking for the same features and a different brand, now that I have returned."
2.0,I love the design but the fabric is too thick and you can not breath through the material!
2.0,"Not the best product.  Tag was torn, looks like someone put a used sweater in the bag."
2.0,I guess I got what I paid for...do not recommend.
2.0,"Unless you are basically a SERIOUS &#34;skinny Minnie&#34;, stay away!!! These are WAY too freakin small, which is a pity; because, they're also REALLY cute! So if your like a size 2, go for it! If your a normal sized woman ( not plus, just average ), don't do it!!!! You have been warned! I'm giving a two stars only for the cute factor, not size..."
2.0,It was only one not 4 like it stated
2.0,The jacket is thin material fits good
2.0,Inside pocket tore the first day
2.0,"Super cute, but turned my finger green!  Description says it is sterling silver, I have my doubts.  The old saying comes to mind - you get what pay for.  The ring was very inexpensive and I will coat it with clear polish to wear it again."
2.0,"Pro: It does protect you from chill wind.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Highly uncomfortable.<br />2. Difficult to wrap it around your face and make the velcros meet easily.<br />3. Impossible to use earphones.<br />4. If you wear glasses, it makes them hazy with your breath."
2.0,"First, they run small. So baby only fit in them for a couple weeks before we sized out of them.<br />But the really annoying part? All the little plastic ties. There were THREE TIES per pair of socks. And that was just holding each sock together. There are additional ones holding the socks to the cardboard.<br />So- while juggling a baby- I had a dozen tiny pieces of plastic to cut. Then gather the two dozen smaller pieces so they don't end up on the floor, in baby's mouth, and eventually baby's stomach."
2.0,"That earring is very pretty. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to get it to close. Would not recommend this."
2.0,The second thin bracelet should be attached to main bracelet bc then you have to put in separate ones all the time! That’s annoying and not a good look! My opinion.
2.0,"the nasal bridge on the mask sticks out like a bird's beak, hard to tell from the product photo"
2.0,Love the socks but the embroidery is so tight around my calves I had to brake so of the thread to even wear
2.0,"It looked nice to start with, but the finish started to rubb off after it had been worn just a few times."
2.0,Not waterproof.  It is the type of nylon woven fabric that once wet the water seeps into.
2.0,"These maybe right for you, but they were more shoe than slipper. Excellent weight for a shoe but heavy for a slipper. I think the product is better for a shoe. As a slipper it was a no go for me."
2.0,"Way too big and clunky especially is you are less than 5'5&#34;  Very cumbersum  If it were a tad smaller it would be great.  Sorry, because i am 5'2&#34; I did not like it at all."
2.0,A lot of them broke the first wearing
2.0,"Unfortunately with the dress sitting how it should on your body the sleeves don’t sit off the shoulder like it describes. When pulled down to be off the shoulder, there is a pull of too much fabric under the arms and the waist sits awkwardly low. The material was also not how I expected, it was stiff, thin and shiny, almost plasticy; the slit is also goes uncomfortably high when you try to walk in it. I’m 5’5”, 130lbs and ordered a small in both the navy and pink. Perhaps it would fit how it should on someone taller."
2.0,Nothing like the picture.....skip this product
2.0,Color was supposed to be olive green but pants were brown in color. Pants were also somewhat small on sizing.
2.0,The pants received were not the ones advertised. They are boot cut not straight leg. They were also very long and nothing like the ones I had bought at sports authority a week earlier.
2.0,I judge T-shirts and sweatshirts by whether they form fabric balls or shrink. This is not shrink but the first time I washed it formed fabric balls on the inside and outside. This is a deal breaker for me and indicate crap materials. So I would recommend against anyone buying it.
2.0,Size chart was not accurate! I measured my kids waists and ordered based on the size chart. Way too small. They would have been great if they fit!
2.0,On the small side for men's socks.
2.0,"I loved these. I love how long and dangly they are. I love how they sweep my shoulders and the pendulum moves around. It's so shiny and glittery with the circles around it. It is light, and doesn't hurt my ear. However, I only got to wear one, briefly. When I went to put the second one on, the post just fell off the base. I hadn't done anything to it except try to poke it through my soft earlobe! I didn't even get to put it in my ear. I see in other reviews that I wasn't the only one with this problem. How will they survive a day of swinging around if they can't take being poked through my earring hole? I am so disappointed. They're beautiful. I'm going to try glue, but I don't usually have much luck gluing metal to metal, especially when it's going to need to support a moving, kind of heavy object. So disappointing."
2.0,quality not up to par...
2.0,"The 2 stars are for the appearance which is as advertised. Great colors and design. Unfortunately, I can't wear them. I have no idea how comfortable they might be if I could get them on my feet. I have purchased socks by multiple manufacturers on Amazon, so it's not like I don't know anything about socks in general. In fact, I only wear bamboo socks anymore because of the supreme comfort. These are the only socks I've ever owned, however, that fit so poorly and so tightly at the heel and toe seams, that I cannot get them on my feet. I have not washed them, so there is no possibility that the seams have shrunk somehow. I don't know what the manufacturer used as a foot model, but I promise you it was not human. The tube socks my blind grandmother knitted for me as a kid fit like a dream compared to these. I'm very unhappy with my purchase and I will be requesting a refund."
2.0,no way this is 3T as my daughter is 2 years old and it should be lose and it barely fitted her.
2.0,Very thin material. Not really worth the money.
2.0,"I bought the shirt because I wanted more casual clothes to wear while working from home. I bought it oversized, and I liked the way it looked! However, after washing it ONE TIME, the black horizontal ""stripes"" REALLY faded! I was going to buy it in another color, but this thing was just a waste of money."
2.0,average only
2.0,My son absolutely ADORES this watch.  So much so that the face completely fell off after only a week and he still demands on wearing it 24/7.  I just super-glued it back on and he was back in business!
2.0,"If you’re looking for soft and cozy Sherpa fleece, skip this - it’s not the same. This jacket feels like it was made from the carpet I grew up in my childhood home in the 1980s. Returned."
2.0,It was see through. Poor quality
2.0,"My fault - I should have read that it's man sized. Pretty, but the size makes it look ridiculous."
2.0,"I purchased these for my daughters upcoming Art Birthday themed party. My almost 7-year old and 2 1/2 year old tried them on. The colors were nice and vibrant, the material was pretty good, but my almost 7-year old said it looked like a shower cap! Ever since she said that, thats all we could think about. The fit was ok, just thought this was not a necessity for the party because who wants to wear a “showecap” to their party. Lol."
2.0,Beautiful hose but the band is too tight and uncomfortable (and I don't have thick legs).
2.0,"Would be super cute but even in the large size I ordered it in it won't fit. Maybe would fit a B cup bra size, & a 32&#34; chest."
2.0,It’s cute. But it does loose it’s shinny glams afterwards
2.0,Not good for large glasses
2.0,"Shipped fast. Received item as described. Chain is extremely frail. I would not sleep in this or work out with it. This is an elegant peice of jewelry for a night out to dinner, ect. As this is a fitness peice, I expected more durability. Its pretty. Not practical."
2.0,The size fits great but you can tell it's a costume and not a custom.
2.0,"dress looks cheap, not sure the clasp on the back would last long. returned"
2.0,"REALLY big. I got the small (5'7"", 125 lbs), and it was like a tent. If that's what you're looking for, this may be for you! I was just looking for something a bit more tailored."
2.0,Got them for my hubby and he said they are inky good for him for reading but they might work better for others whose eyesight aren't as bad
2.0,"The dangle part in the back overwhelms the cross.  And since the cross part is on a hook, I can't even tuck the dangle part into another hole. Oh, and they do to off. Not worth the price."
2.0,"Way to small, there's no stretch to it. Doesn't fit whatsoever."
2.0,Didn't care fro fabric
2.0,"This chocker is pretty and I've gotten compliments on it.  However, I didn't realize it was coming from overseas and it took quite a while to arrive.  I had plans to wear for a particular event, and it arrived too late.  Additionally it is hard to latch because the hook also has a hook and it is hard to maneuver particularly to get it off."
2.0,My daughter used this bag for HS the zipper would not function all the time  and the liner at the bottom of the bag busted
2.0,"I got these for my decade themed birthday dinner and the whole reason I picked these specific boots was because the reviews said they were good for thicker calves. When I tried them on, I literally had to blow a hot hair dryer on them to stretch out the pleather to barely fit my legs. The overall shoe aspect hit but the base was so poorly made that I spent the whole night falling and tripping (I can walk pretty well in heels so it was uncalled for) and I even broke my acrylic nails and injured myself pretty bad from falling. If you decide to still get them, score the bottoms of the shoes with a knife or scissors or something to get a little extra traction and have a blow dryer handy if you half thick calves."
2.0,Looks super cute but all the black and red lettering is smudged and looks terrible. It is super thin and completely see through. Runs small. Unfortunately I have to return it.
2.0,cute but discolored after only a month.
2.0,Very small.. uncomfortable on any toe..  I tried doubling up 2 of the rings and was even worse.
2.0,This dress just didn’t live up to the expectation and I sent it back. It was too big and the fabric is very thin...
2.0,"Unfortunately, I never got the opportunity to actually wear this shirt at length. I was only able to try it initially to find that it does not fit me at all.<br /><br />It is a very lovely shirt, and the fabric feels comfortable. I would in no way call this a tunic shirt, though. I am 5'7 1/2&#34; and 200 lbs. I usually wear size L shirts, and size 14/16 pants (depending on how they fit). Since I usually wear L and reviews were advising to go up a size or two, I got the XL (the largest size they offer) and kept my fingers crossed. Usually clothes I have ordered on Amazon that ship from China have fit (some a little more snug than others) when I sized up. This is absolutely not the case with this shirt. I can't even try to make it work. The sleeves are very adorable but were uncomfortably tight around my arms. I could not imagine walking around all day with my circulation being cut off. The waist of the shirt was also extremely tight and form fitting. This XL really felt much like a size medium.<br /><br />They do have exceptional customer service, though. I tried to get a refund and the seller worked with me on a way to avoid the shipping costs back to China. I really do appreciate the effort they put in to make the process as easy as possible so that we could quickly resolve the refund into an agreement we could both be happy with.<br /><br />I would recommend this shirt if you wear a size small or medium. Just be warned that it might be very uncomfortable to wear if you wear a large or higher size.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
2.0,The concept is nice but it tangles every time I wear it.
2.0,Waited until Monday to try this dress on have a wedding on Saturday and it does not fit in the chest at all but did everywhere else. Last day for return was july 5th and it's July 6th smh
2.0,"These are described as being suitable for use with hammocks among other things.  What I have in mind is nowhere near that strenuous on the carabiners, but I honestly expected them to be made of some kind of metal given what the description said.  Uncool, guys. Now I need to look for some REAL wiregate carabiners."
2.0,"I was so excited to get this dress. Unfortunately, it is huge. For reference, I am 4'10"" and about 115 pounds. Dress came to my knees, and was very wide. I felt that it looked more like a size Large. Sadly will be returning."
2.0,The quality and the design are poor
2.0,I would have to go up 2 sizes to wear the product. The suggested sizing recommended should be updated.
2.0,"Odd fit, runs small."
2.0,Sheap material!
2.0,"I'm always very skeptical when ordering clothes offline, but I decided to go for this shirt since the reviews were good. I ordered the olive green. When it arrived it was nicely packaged and seemed well made. HOWEVER, the &#34;green&#34; is barely green at all. It has lots of tan in it and the color is not flattering at all. I ordered an XS which is what I normally wear. I was expecting it to be a little loose, but it I felt like I was swimming in it! The cut of the shirt was also a little shorter than I was expecting. Sad it didn't work out. I had to return this item."
2.0,Had to wait a month for shipping and product fit very loose. Also very thin material not warm at all.
2.0,Just won’t stay on
2.0,Didn't like how the neck line fit.
2.0,"Beige looks like creme, frame too small, great quality was so looking forward to wearing them,gave them to my 9 years old daughter, fits her perfect. If u are looking for a large frame these are not it."
2.0,"Nice, but too big."
2.0,I love the feel of the shirt and the vibrant colors but I’m giving it 2*s because it fits way too small for an XL. Fits more like a M and just about rolls up when I stretch lol
2.0,much more blue tone in person
2.0,"I loved the picture of it, but upon receiving it I got a faulty jacket.  So disappointing."
2.0,"Beware! Fits great, looks great but will snag your clothing! :-("
2.0,"this product didn't come in for more than three months, and they do not stay buttoned"
2.0,Very cheaply made...disappointed. I purchased an additional handbag the same day for aprox. the same cost and was very happy with the quality.
2.0,"Lenses fit my Oakley Bottlecap frame.  However, the outside coating scratched very easily.  Had to buy another replacement lense after a few months."
2.0,"Cute and comfy dress. As mentioned material is thin. What I didn’t expect was that after wearing it my first day and taking it off, the dress split across the stripes at the bottom front. I guess I’m not wearing it a second time - who knows what will rip next."
2.0,"This runs SO SMALL! I'm a medium on the torso, and large on the hips. I ordered a 2xl since the sizing is so different, and still couldn't get it over my hips. Quality is okay."
2.0,"A very small XL.  If you choose to purchase this skirt, consider the next size up for a bit of room.  Like the color."
2.0,Not really what I thought it would be. The image in the middle isn't great quality and mine came looking kind of dirty. I'd return it but the cost of shipping was almost as much as the product itself so its kind of pointless.
2.0,Watch quit after 4 months after buying it!
2.0,Too small for D’s
2.0,"poorly made , broke within two weeks"
2.0,I've purchased two cases. within three to four months both cases experienced a spring failure which prevented the case from closing and rendering is useless.
2.0,"Very pretty but very difficult to get on, if you don’t plan ahead and put these on like 20 minutes earlier than you need to you’ll be late to whatever event you plan on attending"
2.0,Lace straps were twisted and coming apart<br />Fabric was extremely thin and rough
2.0,It looks really cheap.  I have had other gold plated items that looked a lot better than this one does.
2.0,The bottom comes out after a few uses.
2.0,"This shirt became pilled, stretched and unsightly after one wash and my daughter did not find it comfortable under her brace. We found the “MD Womens Undershirt Short Sleeve Bamboo” top a vastly superior choice- it is far more comfortable and much more attractive and durable— at about half the cost."
2.0,"I really liked these earrings!  However, after only a few wears, one of them broke 😭"
2.0,More like a junior size. It fit but fabric so has so much give it dose not have the body needed to make the dress look very high quality. Also it arrives so wrinkled that  without washing first and pressing it would be hard to tell how it might look at its best.
2.0,Terribly cheap. I'm going to have to re-wire them too as they both face the same direction and are no where near as large as shown on the model.
2.0,Very stiff and uncomfortable to sleep in. Crotch had a hole in it. My husband won't wear them so will donate to goodwill.
2.0,This runs very big for its size y daughter is 2 years old and the shorts for but the short was way to big 😢
2.0,"These were advertized as large, but they don't come close to covering my glasses.  The size of the lens should have been stipulated in the ad."
2.0,"Low-quality, again not surprised with the price. However target has similar prices and much better looking and feeling wallets with zippers that work."
2.0,It was so tiny that you could barely see what it was. I was embarrassed to give it to my stepdaughter.
2.0,"Do not buy these shorts.  They look good and fit well, but the quality is no good.  There's now a hole in the rear near the pocket.  I've had them for a year which doesn't sound too bad, but I haven't worn them very much; only once a week on hot summer days."
2.0,"I purchased this to have a cotton blend, short sleeve, comfortable nightgown. I got size 2X as I wear a 16/18 and wanted it to be roomy enough. I was positive 2X would be large enough since there aren't any larger options. The gown was a disappointment it was not only slightly snug in the hips and waist it was also incredibly short. It came down to the middles of my thighs. So I could definately not wear it as a gown, I'd have to wear shorts or sweats underneath. The one plus was the material was very comfortable and soft and I was pleased with the designs."
2.0,Really wanted to like this. But the fit and cut and shape was not portioned well.
2.0,There were no pins in these bands. No way to attach them to the watch. a waste of money!
2.0,Not very stylish. Just large-ish fabric with no forms. It's not form fitting at all.
2.0,I decided to use the purple one first and wiped it down with an alcohol wipe prior to using it. The purple paint came right off! They are also not as long as I expected they would be for pregnancy belly rings. I can use them for now but I will probably have to buy a longer one at some point before i deliver baby.
2.0,Stiff material.  Pattern is also not crisp and blurry/blow out looking.
2.0,"It’s pretty but the back pieces are not good I almost  lost my earring in the street, it almost fell down the drain more then once but basically it just came off my ear multiple times.. I wanted to wear them often like all the time because it is nice but I can’t because I’m afraid I may loose them."
2.0,Looks great but the threading broke after 2 wears.
2.0,size not correct the large is a small
2.0,Doesn't fit as expected.  Shirt is wide not long as it appears in picture.
2.0,"Nice quality shoe tree.  Unfortunately, they are too long.  I needed a size 8 1/2, but they only had 7-8 & 9-10. I have many other styles of shoe trees and they have a good 4 inches of spring so I purchased the 9-10 to make sure that they would have enough 'push' to keep the shoes straight.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these trees only have about 2 inches of spring so I'm unable to get them into the shoe.  If I purchase the 7-8, I'm afraid that they won't be long enough.  Too bad because, aside from that, they're good trees."
2.0,"i wouldn't suggest you order this if you have hips or a booty, pretty much unless you look like the model in the picture. I ordered a large and the waist fit fine, the length in front was fine but in the back it covered like half of my butt. Even if i got the next size up the front would still be longer for me."
2.0,"I love this jacket/coat. Being broad shouldered, finding a coat that I can comfortably drive in is nearly impossible. This coat has been a life saver. I feel free to move in it, yet it is warm and cute to boot. The inner lining keeps me warm but doesn't overheat me. You do need to both zip and button for a more professional/clean cut look, but even open it does the job well. The sleeves are not lined like the body of the coat, which I think it perfect since you are most likely wearing long sleeves anyway. I bought the black, and really love it. It is cable knit so on the sleeve if it is pulled taught you can see color through it. It doesn't bother me but I thought I would let those of you reading reviews know, in case it is a deal breaker for you. It is also long. Not so much that you look goofy (depending on your height), but enough that it can pretty much cover my bum while standing. I think it is nice when it is cold, but if that isn't something you like, now you know it does do that. I'm 5'9 and around 150 and I purchased a Large for size reference. Hope this review helps, as I looked and debated about this coat forever, and I'm glad I finally bought it!"
2.0,While the skirt is ok I had to return it because the slip was torn at one of the hoops.  It appeared that perhaps it has been previously returned for the same reason.
2.0,"I was looking for sleeping gowns and sleep sacks for long babies and I couldn't find much around. This product was the longest one available so I gave them a try.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these gowns, but they didn't turn out too well. I bought this for my 2 month baby that is 23 1/2 inches long.<br /><br />Reading other reviews and knowing that they may shrink a bit when washed (cotton usually does), I bought the biggest one they had, 12-18 months. They advertise it as ""29-32 inches"" so I figured even with shrinkage i'd be ok for a few months.<br /><br />After washing, mine are now a bit short of 24 inches. I lost 5 INCHES WHEN WASHING!!!!!<br /><br />The fabric is thick cotton, and arms have the mitten cuffs, which is nice, but length is way off now.<br />The manufacturer should pre-wash their fabrics so they don't lose this much.<br />I wouldn't recommend this product, unfortunately."
2.0,"Was able to unlock it, but was never able to close or lock back once opened. Renders it kinda useless. :("
2.0,"Its nice but my main down vote is because eventually the string starts to fray, split and become loose.  I lost one before bouggt somewhere else and I thought it was because i wore it in the shower.  Not this case.  I have others that last much much longer and still have.  So, i wouldnt buy this again"
2.0,"Not very stretchy and the cups are very firm, a little uncomfortable"
2.0,"This didn't really look fantastic on me - probably because it's so thin its almost see through. I love the softness of it though. I wear it to bed fairly often, but I wouldn't wear it outside of the house. The neckline also doesn't lend itself to an undershirt, so..."
2.0,"These socks were too big for my newborn’s feet and they kept falling off, which was really annoying."
2.0,It’s okay. If you have small wrist pls don’t buy it.<br />The locking is poor quality. I returned my product.
2.0,"Stitching is pretty bad. It's awkwardly long in my opinion, but this could be okay in the right outfit."
2.0,It’s not the same robe I ordered. It’s not waffle it’s flannel and it was suppose to be a solid color and it’s plaid. I was disappointed
2.0,"I am not saying that I hate this dress, I just don't like it. The quality is kind of bad, the finishing on the product is horrible. I believe for the money you can buy something nicer and of better quality."
2.0,"Loved it at first, but the strap broke off 2 weeks after using it."
2.0,Dress comes to a point where the pockets are so the dress looks like a diamond shape. Doesn’t lay flat like the picture
2.0,"Super cute, but because the design is open, it can snag on stuff very easily. This only lasted me like 2 weeks then snapped when it got caught in my hair."
2.0,This thing is cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.  The Bad english on the packaging is pretty funny to read though.
2.0,"I bought the big brother/little brother set for my grandsons.  Quality is fine and delivered quickly but the sizes are so far off.  The pants on the left are a size 12-18months which are going to be too short.  The ones on the right are a size 0-3months.  Anyone see a problem here?  The are way too big to even try to remedy without deconstructing the garment entirely.  The shirt for the big brother should fit fine but again, the 0-3 months onesie is much too large.  As you can see by the photo, they are basically the same size."
2.0,The sleeves and the top are different colors. I would like to exchange the item for one that matches.
2.0,This is cheaply made... the bow has come on the first wear... very disappointed  because  it is a beautiful  causal  shoe for school
2.0,Very short in the front
2.0,"Bottom is fine, the top is too small and the straps are too short. Very strange fit! I will be returning this one!"
2.0,"i choose this rating becos the design on the toe ring came off everytime i wore one.i bought this ring becos of the different color,i thought it would be cool to switch colors every now and then.But,Now am relunctant wearing the others left as i have already tried two of them with the design comin off.And also no matter how much i adjusted it,it wont fit properly.The design is cute,but color does not stay."
2.0,Bought them to make mask but did not work becuase the material is very thing
2.0,They are too short.
2.0,smells and too short
2.0,"beautiful, but had to return because a stone was missing."
2.0,"Well I should’ve read the description more but if your a curvy women with big hips, expect to suffocated"
2.0,"This coat did not fit as expected.  It was much too tight at the waist and much too short in the back.  On a very trim lady, it might be fine, but not for the average build woman."
2.0,Poor and cheap quality. Fabric is uncomfortable for skin. Joints of fabrics don't look good. For the same price it's possible to buy much better dress.
2.0,Broke the next day after i got it. Through when you buy something like this so cheap it can be expected to happen.
2.0,"I kinda like these pants... They're thin so they're &#34;Phoenix-Approved.&#34; According to my fashion advisors (AKA my 15 yr-old kid and her posse) the cut is outdated. The legs are MUCH wider than they appear in the product description. In the photo, they seem to be a straight leg but in reality, they're more like a wide leg flare style.<br /><br />Anyways, these have been designated as PJ Pants. No way would I wear them to the gym.<br /><br />Also, while I approximate the thermal coolness factor, I don't think the quality of the fabric warrants the cost. I believe I bought these when the price happened to temporarily go down one day, but the regular/full price far exceeds the value of the product."
2.0,"Yeah.  No.  If your ta-tas are bigger than a toddlers,  this isn't gonna work.  I ordered an xl, I usually wear a m/l, yeah sure it fit but the top part was like a tiny belt around my chest. As a busty girl I don't have the luxury of not wearing a bra,  there was more bra than dress showing. For funzies I tried no bra... as soon as I move I flopped the girls right out the bottom."
2.0,It's not for TV
2.0,"Quality seems good but I received the wrong bottoms. I ordered estella and received sandy, One side is grey and the other is silver."
2.0,Waistband of pajama bottoms has elastic which is not good for Atopic Dermatitis sufferers.  Ad said set was 100% cotton.
2.0,I love the styling but am pretty disappointed in the quality.  I had $400+ prescription lenses installed and now have to keep tightening the tiny cheaply made flathead screws on the sides every other day to keep them from falling off my face.  Really bummed but get compliments on them all the time-go figure.
2.0,"The velcro is come out, not properly stitches. QC need to improve."
2.0,"Was hoping this was highlighter yellow, but the color is actually green"
2.0,"Loved the color, usually love Pajama Jeans but these are VERY DISAPPOINTING :( They are stiffer yet thinner fabric than my other pairs and SHRANK AFTER WASHING in cold water/hang dry! No wonder they were cheaper than the bootcut ones too. These are NOT SKINNY LEGS, THESE ARE MORE STOVE PIPE/STRAIGHT LEG AND THE ANKLES FLARE. And it looks even more ridiculous after shrinking almost TWO INCHES in length- I'm a size 2-4 and these are a 4-6 and very tight (and now ""highwaters""). I'm going to wear them out and see just how ridiculous they look if they aren't ""pajama jean comfy"" or if they're silly looking after shrinking so much I'll just return them before the end of the month.<br />Shame, quality usually is good and this color is gorgeous but I'm wondering if they're KNOCK-OFFS since the inside string is yellow (not the usual pink) and the fabric is scratchy and not as stretchy. I'll avoid this vendor and let my friends know too so they don't get stuck with unfashionable, shrinking pants."
2.0,"These run small. I know compression socks are to be snug , but you have to get them on. I have purchased better for less. They also get very warm......"
2.0,It is very very small. Can't even tie it to the back of my heard. And I don't have a big head.
2.0,"I like the thickness of the fabric, and the seams haven't fallen apart yet (it's been 3 washes so far). BUT I can can only wear these at home. The waist to hip area is too small and there's no room for the butt, while the waist band has either stretched after washing or been so loose from the start, so it doesnt stay up at the waist line and gets pulled down all the time exposing a half of my butt."
2.0,Material is very thin and cheap. Turtle neck collar is too small so it doesn't shape properly. Closer to a high neck T-shirt than turtle neck.
2.0,Me llegó en dos colores los aretes son de otro color
2.0,The earrings look nice in the package but unless you have really large ear lobes the whole head doesn't look right on ears
2.0,Great concept!  Absurd price.
2.0,"This visor is just “ok”. It’s very large and awkward but does a decent job of blocking sun from hitting your face. In the end, it was just too bulky to easily wear so it ended up going back."
2.0,This shirt is just cut weird. I tried both the Xsmall and small. IFit was just unflattering. I returned it.
2.0,These boots run small. My toddler wears size 7 but I ordered a size 8 just to be safe. They were still too small so I have to return them.
2.0,The rose just fell off and looks cheap in real life. It might be good to wear once to a Halloween party or something though.
2.0,Right necklace wrong inspirational saying. Got 2 elephant necklaces one for me and one for my bestie because the message was about friendship. But got them and the message was about luck. Description of message is not right.
2.0,Love the look but the sharp edges on this cut my finger in the club and it's not really safe to be wearing in crowds. Wish the silver cross was inside the black and not elevated out.
2.0,"The pattern is cute, however-I will be sending it back. The picture makes it look like the sleeves come down more. I am 6'0, so I know my arms are longer, but these sleeves are much shorter than described."
2.0,Cute but didn't like the rubberized applique flowers. I thought the flower pattern was in the material.
2.0,"Was happy when they arrived, fit was good if a bit too big. After first wash, legs shrunk too much and pants are now too short and too tight. Disappointed as I waited a long time for these to arrive. Bought a “34” though I wear a 32” waist pants and am thin."
2.0,Sadly not the color in the photo. Looks super dingy and faded. Too late to return. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Top around bust is a bit small if you are busty, bottom is ridiculous like a giant frumpy sack. Just not flattering for shorter women."
2.0,Style is cute/- a pain in the ass to iron!
2.0,"The description says ""For Men & Women,"" but the 2.5"" ear loops are too small for the average man. The claim that the loops can be adjusted to 5"" is false, unless they're talking about stretching the loops, which bends my ears forward. I'm returning it."
2.0,The one strap was ripped
2.0,Way too small for an x large.  I wear women's m
2.0,"Price is good for a swimsuit to fit a short person with a wide torso.  Suit is simple, without support or structure."
2.0,Did fine for 16 months then died. Tried to have battery replaced but back was rusted on. Had to toss.
2.0,package was all taped up like it had been a returned item...torn package
2.0,"see through, but worked for a Halloween costume"
2.0,They were too small! I couldn't even get it on!
2.0,"Looked pretty good, and seemed to be reasonable quality. It was rather thick though, other that that very good"
2.0,"Poor quality, wrinkles easily, thin transparent."
2.0,"My first pair I bought months ago were great. I got a new pair and the new pair is about 25% smaller and of much cheaper quality. As such, they don't fit very well at all."
2.0,"1. Buy am extender, otherwise it is a pain to put on<br />2. The longest necklace is crooked and not properly aligned/centered<br />3. There is a large gap between the 3rd and 4th necklaces, making it look uneven when you wear it"
2.0,"While the material is nice and the dress is still cute, the only similarity to the photo is the color. My daughter was very bummed to recieve this dress for her dance when she ordered something very different. No ribbon, no high/low, it's a v-neck instead, the shoulders are very different"
2.0,"Purchased the light pink one. After a week of having it, this black mark started to develop. Now I have had it for a couple months and it looks like the attached pictures. I tried cleaning it with soap and water because I just thought it got dirty but the color is just faded.... It has not broken though so that's good."
2.0,"This dress came quickly and seemed to be of decent enough quality. It looked like the pictures and wasn’t too thin of a material. I ended up returning this dress because of the neckline. I looked at pictures other customers had posted, which showed a deep neckline, but not too deep. When I put this on, it was going down below my bust, probably by an entire inch. It was super open with too much fabric at the top of the dress, which caused me to barely be covered up. I’m not super busty, 36C, but in a medium it was tight near my middle, but loose on top."
2.0,"Dress fits smaller than expected, especially small in the arms"
2.0,"Previous bought an XL pajama shorts and fit great.  Bought a second pair of shorts in a different design, same size XL and they fit like a medium or large.  Will not pay $7.99 to return so I gave them to my skinny sister."
2.0,Item is cheap in quality
2.0,"Good Quality, lovely fabric but it was too small.  I gifted this item."
2.0,It's bigger than I was expecting. It almost touches my upper lip.
2.0,All the black dots inside fell out within a week. Not sure what that means
2.0,"cute look, bad fit."
2.0,This is after I tried using sweater shaver..<br />looks and fits ok but looks like it’s a very old shirt
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress. But the material was not as quality as i would expect for a fall dress. Very thim and could see through. The neckline had an odd scrunge piece that wasnt flattering. Lastly the small was too large. I'm 5'3"" 115 and small in the chest and it looked quiey baggy in a way that wasnt cute. Not for me but def not like the picture."
2.0,These are soo cute! but  I’m disappointed because I ordered the ‘pink’ color which shows a very nice soft pink. but these almost neon pink sunglasses came! Not quite my aesthetic😂<br />It didnt have prime shipping so it took a month and a half to be delivered.
2.0,Earrings arrived with center jewel unglued. I had to glue it back on myself but it still fell off at the end of the night. :(
2.0,"Cute, but the top was too short and shrank even more when I washed it."
2.0,Pattern was cute and material was light.  But the fit was very baggy in the seat and thighs. It looked more like bloomers.
2.0,Very small. Nice color and fabric
2.0,Very small Chief Anchor....
2.0,Bracelet is dull. Not really shiny like the pic
2.0,More white than dots!
2.0,"These are not pants, they’re leggings. While they are super cute, I can’t wear them without a long top. Which is not what I planned to do. Totally not work appropriate otherwise."
2.0,"Cute dress, nice colors, but size chart was way off..  I returned for a credit"
2.0,"looks nothing like photo...fabric stiff and scratchy.  very, very small"
2.0,Runs small and sticks to your skin
2.0,"The patterns and designs are cute, and they are not scratchy at all. But my son has had 2 of the elastics on them snap off on 5 masks that he’s used so far. He hasn’t had this issue with any other masks I’ve purchased; makes me wonder how many of the box we will actually get use of."
2.0,"Even in a big size, this ran super small. Looks nothing like the picture. Not only that, but the stitching was not straight. Not worth returning because of the cheap price, so I gave it away."
2.0,Not the greatest product but they served their purpose. Most of them had a ripple line along the top edge of the glasses which was kinda annoying ma
2.0,This dress arrived very wrinkled. I ironed it and the wrinkles came right back. It must have been packaged under something heavy for a long time. Nothing I’ve tried removes the wrinkles.
2.0,The masks are cute. But way too big for both my 5 year old and 8 year old. More like teen/adult sized masks. Couldn’t use them at all since I bought them for my kids to wear during their Xmas concert.
2.0,"These are short in length, but not petite-sized.  I'm 4-10 110 lbs and I ordered the smallest size.  They are way too high-waisted.  I have to fold the waist over to get the right fit, but then that obviously looks sloppy.  They are also much itchier than I expected."
2.0,I purchased this cap for my husband to wear during the summer to keep his ears and the back of his head from being sun-burned and attacked by biting insects.  I was disappointed to find that the removable flap that is supposed to cover the ears and back of the neck does not cover the back of the head.  The opening above the caps' adjustment strap exposes the wearers' scalp to the sun and biting insects.  I would not recommend the cap if you are purchasing it for protection from biting insects or sun exposure on the back of your head.
2.0,This dragon is heavy and only has one cuff so it doesn't stay on the ear. It needs two to stay on the ear.
2.0,The shoes are super cute but rub on the top of your foot. Gave me a terrible blister.
2.0,The mechanical clasp comes open all the time. Disappointed.
2.0,"This is such a fun and playful print and fabric I am really disappointed in the unflattering fit. It was so unflattering on that my husband told me to go change before we left on a hiking trip.<br /><br />There is some strange ruching at the neckline, lots of billowing fabric around the torso and then a snug waist band that fits about at the hips. I ordered a medium based on the size chart, I think I may have been happier with a small. It definitely runs big.<br /><br />There is so much extra fabric in the middle it could almost be worn as a maternity top. The other thing to note I the neckline is low for a sports top and the built in bra isn't snug. So don't expect to do an intense workout in this top without the potential for a serious wardrobe malfunction.<br /><br />I do not recommend this shirt."
2.0,"Very low quality materials were used for these hats and they are smaller than advertised. Would not a normal adults head. When I took the hats out of the cheap bag they came in, they immediately started falling apart. Would recommend a different brand instead."
2.0,Doesn’t fit like a traditional do rag - it’s extremely well made but the design is funky
2.0,Fits great but its nt the change at the picture.  It's way lighter and has more White on it.
2.0,I ordered a size smaller because it was noted that the pants were oversized.  I could fit the pants but it wasn't roomy as stated.  The material is rough.  So be careful when you order these pants.  The legs are tapered  to<br />tight which should be ballooned out.
2.0,the pockets are at my ribs....and I am 5'2&#34;
2.0,"I own two other down jackets by Orolay so I am familiar with their sizing. I love their balance in price and quality and I've developed a brand confidence with them. If I'm happy with my other down jackets, why did I buy this one? The style! Well, in order to carry this style, the jacket can't be too roomy or you would lose the trendy, fitted look. I am 5'4&#34; 125lbs in average shape and I wear US size small or medium. My other two Orolay jackets are in small, but I ordered a medium for this one per other reviews. I find the medium is still snug.<br /><br />The jacket arrived in a plastic zip bag. As soon as I took it out I knew it was not made with the same level of quality I'm familiar with. The shell is thinner than my other jackets.  The down fill felt thin too. I hung it up to air to allow it to decompress fully and unwrinkle. After a few days I checked on it and it did not change my initial thoughts. I decided to test it out on a 40° day with a little breeze given its lightness, I did not feel warm! My other two Orolay down jackets would have made me sweat. The only closure are snap buttons, no zippers, so I think cold air gets in easily in between. Also, the buttons snapped off easily; when I got into my car, the bottom two unsnapped. When I walked, the bottom most one unsnapped. Cold air could easily travel up from the bottom. We've had some really blustering weather this season in the Northeast and my other Orolay jackets protected me well, with some smart layering of course.<br /><br />More on the buttons... Because of the asymmetrical design, there are a lot of awkwardness with the button placements. In order to be sure I'm lining up the buttons right, I have to start from the bottom. Once I get to the neck, I have to feel around to find the button. If I leave the top unbuttoned, the look is weird and sloppy. The buttons are sewn through so the stitches are visible inside the jacket. That's not an issue; however, the button in the pocket area should not have been done this way because the pocket got sewn through! I was cold and I tried to keep my gloved hands in my pockets. The left hand had to be extra careful because of fear of ripping the stitching out from the inside of the pocket for that button that is sewn through! The left pocket is usable but it is oddly shaped inside due to a slight blockage with the button stitching. It's roomy enough to fit my wallet or phone, but not deep enough for fear of things falling out. Also, I think there's a worksmanship issue, the fabrics were not lined up right when sewning in that trouble button because the fabrics is not straight there.<br /><br />In sum, I think this jacket material and style combination is too ambitious and it failed in the end to satisfy functionality.  Disappointingly, I returned it and did not try a large because I would lose the fitted look."
2.0,"This dress isn't as feminine as expected.  I'm keeping because I can accessorize with it.  Without accessories, it is worthless.  I just ordered two more dresses from Amazon.  If they are as unremarkable as the last two I ordered I won't be ordering any more dresses through Amazon.  AND as I said, the garment is clingy.  I have to spray water or liquid fabric softener on it to make it comfortable.  I'm disappointed."
2.0,Suppose to be Aqua Marine but it's more just light blue!
2.0,"I have seen a couple reviews with this similiar issue so buyer beware. Product is one main LED that lughrs through the suspender side not multiple LEDs. I decided to purchase even with the issue in reviews thinking it wouldn't happen to be but it did. Only left side had the light bright enough that it lit up the entire suspender piece. The right side light was extremely dim not lightning uo the right suspender at all. Overall, product was delivered with only one side that lit up so i returned the product."
2.0,"This dress is super cute but was way too tight in the bust! I am normally a small but ordered a medium because other reviews mentioned it being tight across the bust, and it was still too tight. The top button was about to pop open. My bust size is 34D, so it’s not like I have giant boobs. I will be returning."
2.0,"Dress looks great, I ordered an XL - looks like I needed an XXL (US Reg 12)"
2.0,"pretty junky, the plastic wrap on the arms starts separating in a couple weeks.  I only use these as spare glasses for the car now."
2.0,"I purchased this bracelet as a gift. It was supposed to be 8 inches, but it was not and it did not fit the recipient. A waste of money, unfortunately!"
2.0,Dislike because it get rusty ans broke off easily
2.0,"I ordered these because they were priced lower than most compression socks. Although the sizing info seems to be correct and the material they are made of feels goods, they are not particularly well made. I say this because the toe seams are very thick--not flat like more expensive compression socks. They are thick enough for me to feel when wearing them and rub against my shoe. I didn't trust them not to give me a blister. If you have tough toes that can handle the rubbing of a thick toe seam, they might not be a problem for you. The seller does show interest by sending a follow-up email. When I described the toe seam problem I had, they wished me luck. I returned the socks."
2.0,Already broke. My son was showering and it just fell apart
2.0,"I am 5'4"" and 117lbs, I ordered a small.  It was huge...could have passed as a large. I tried so hard to tie the steps to make it work...no, nope, negative. I wanted to wear this so bad for my trip to Vegas! Returned."
2.0,Just received these today. They seem really thin which should be fine for Spring and Summer. Put them in the washing machine before using and one of the bows fell off already.
2.0,Though it fits around my head (and I ordered larger than I needed) it does not fit onto my head. It sits far to high on the back of my head and is very uncomfortable.
2.0,"I like how light these sunglasses are, and it was so affordable that I was able to buy 2 pairs. I usually go through sunglasses really quickly because our kids get a hold of them, thus the reason I bought these at a more affordable price. One of the pairs is still good, the other one had a lens pop out already. Then while trying to pop it back in, it cracked the frame. One down, one to go, I guess."
2.0,"The coat is advertised as waterproof, but it doesn’t repel water at all (see pictures). The fit and color is nice, and it’s fine to wear on a cold, dry day. I bought this jacket specifically because I wanted a waterproof winter jacket, so I’m disappointed."
2.0,Im giving two stars. It is a beautiful shirt and looks as pictured but....i am 105 pounds soaking wet and ordered a small and i put it on and it fit like a large baggy tshirt on me. Not satisified with the sizing.
2.0,"Size up. This sweater is small. It also has a tapered look at the bottom of the sweater vs. the flowy look as in the picture. Waffle appearance is adorable, love the look, it's just too small."
2.0,"First of all, I want to say that I bought this solely because the other big guy who bought this tie and supposedly worked out for him. He has a photo. I do not. My husband is about 61 260 pounds could probably get away with an XL but prefers to wear XXL. This tie comes up a little short on him and now that I think of it, I think I ordered the same one last year and black and we had to return that as well.  This Tie came up to maybe a couple inches above his belly button. If you are wearing it under a jacket and plan to keep your jacket on the entire time, then this tie will do the job."
2.0,"This is comfortable, but I have only washed it a few times and it is already pilled and faded."
2.0,It is Not like the picture
2.0,The four leaf clover in the picture is bright.  In person it is dull not very excited about it at all would not reorder
2.0,Beautiful ring BUT turned finger green 1 week after I got it and black spot in middle of ring the color always stayed blue.
2.0,"It was too tight and thin, look nothing like the picture wasted my money  I wear a size 10 bought a large didn't work and iam skinny😓"
2.0,Too small for my needs
2.0,"The tip and buckle ends of the belt are the correct size for a pair of Wranglers.  The ""scalloped""portion of the belt that comprises 80% of the belt is so skinny that it looks like it should be a women's belt.  Everything about the belt is just fine besides the fact that it's way too skinny for my liking.  I'm returning the belt.  Received the belt quickly, packaging was good.  Leather a little stiff but would probably soften in time.  Sorry to give it two stars but I don't have any cowboy buddies that would wear that belt and neither would I.  Far too skinny."
2.0,Order a size up. This dress is TIGHT.
2.0,Ass too fat. Cute though
2.0,"Was suppose to be an adult size, but didn't even cover my shoulders. Was not as pictured."
2.0,"Very small, slips of my head."
2.0,"Bought this for a specific event. I chose to go 2 sizes smaller because of the reviews and it was still beyond huge! The color is not as vibrant as the picture. Disappointing, it could be such a great look."
2.0,"Not impressed for the price , same as a $10 pair at menards. Also irritating to get fingers in with to much material inside glove it punches up."
2.0,Saggy  in the crotch area. Wanted to wear ankle boots with them but really loose around the ankles. Looked funny.
2.0,I bought this for my mom and she wasn't happy with it said it looks sloppy
2.0,I dont't like it.
2.0,"It runs very small. I wear size L but I ordered XXL, and it feels like I'm wearing size M vest. Also, material is very noisy and probably not very breathable. Too bad, the vest is well build with a lot of big and small pockets."
2.0,"I'm 6'1"".  The torso on this XL was made for someone that's easily 8-10 inches taller than me (the pockets/waistline are well below my hips).  But the arms and legs seem to be from a Medium as they come down to mid forearm and about 6 inches above my ankle.  The spider on the front wasn't centered and the hood was made for an infant.  The material is nice and the concept is awesome, but unfortunately the measurements just aren't reliable."
2.0,Enamel comes off pretty quickly otherwise I loved it.
2.0,Fits my 8yo daughter (who is small for her age) perfectly. Not for an adult.
2.0,"This was a beautiful costume ring, but the gem was crooked in the setting. Fortunately, it was inexpensive and hopefully no one will look at it that closely."
2.0,"This was advertised as an XL hat.  It was so tight that it was uncomfortable, and I don't have a big head.  I returned it."
2.0,"Oh yeah, the article on numerous fake ratings on Amazon.<br /><br />Soft? This fabric is anything but soft. It's like a shirt made out of a tent. If you wear it while running, you will be slower. If you wear it while playing tennis, you will get to less balls.<br /><br />What is with the Velcro on the sleeve and how come that isn't pictured?<br /><br />The good thing is if you buy enough of these and get caught in a rain storm, you can make a tent and be dry."
2.0,To small and looks nothing like picture.
2.0,"I wanted so badly to like this hat, I needed it for walking I couldn't fit it at all and no brim at all to keep the sun out I'm sending it back tomorrow. So disappointed I was baking in the sun today during my walk."
2.0,Cute but they shrunk significantly after the first wash such that they fit now a size smaller.
2.0,One lens wouldn't stay up so it was a bit wonky having 1 lens that didn't do up & was lose
2.0,The shape of the shoulder and arms are weird. They connect in an odd spot.
2.0,Not flattering if you have any bumps or curves. Returned.
2.0,Does not drape nicely. Too thin and the sleeves are weird
2.0,"These only lasted one season. I mean, they didn't break or anything, but now they are so uncomfortable, I would rather go barefooted. Those thinking about purchasing a long term flop, look elsewhere."
2.0,Was not easy to assemble.......had to change parts with primal band for it to fit
2.0,Literally faded within two wears lol
2.0,"The silver one was fine, but the gold one came broken."
2.0,"I know the dress is sparkly on the outside, but the inside is so itchy and scratchy, I thought it’d at least be a diff material on the inside. :("
2.0,Please keep in mind this dress looks nothing like the photograph. It was a thicker material than what is shown. They met the expectation on delivery date but a little disappointed that it wasn't exactly the same dress in the picture.  Great communication regarding size and delivery time. Thank you.
2.0,The sizing is off. The length especially. The fabric is very soft and washes nicely.
2.0,It's way to big
2.0,"I was so excited when I held the box it was in but after opening it I couldn't have been more disappointed, when opening the box I found that the gem had moved as if glued on at last minute and it has scratches on it, if you look in the questions someone asks what size it is and the answer is &#34;it's one size so it fits almost all&#34; but it's actual size is small luckily it still fit my finger, would not buy unless a new one is sent because this is unacceptable"
2.0,"The belt started to fall apart after no more than two months of accumulated use. I've had it for longer than a year, but used it only occasionally. In the beginning, it appeared to be of high quality, but all was just an appearance. Poorly made with poor material.<br /><br />Too bad, because I liked its low-key style. I don't like belts that have big gaudy buckles even with ornaments. The problem is that most dress belts are like that. This belt is a very nice exception. The leather is rather stiff, but I liked it this way.  It is true to the size."
2.0,"Runs extremely small. I bought (XL) because I'm pregnant and can still fit into Med. dresses, was buying more for the belly room and it couldn't even get the top over my shoulders."
2.0,The hat is smaller than shown in the picture. The face cover plastic is flimsy and makes everything look a bit distorted. Barely good enough to consider it a good purchase. Good face coverage though.
2.0,"I did not like the material. Thin, not soft cloth"
2.0,Not comfortable material is rough
2.0,The dog looks a little off like the stitching didn't match. It's an okay hat. Just not the best picture.
2.0,Waaaaaay TOO big so sending back. The print is beautiful but sewn in such a way that the pattern is cut off in obvious places :( Material was quality...Would have kept it true to size and the print was sewn to not cut the head in half!
2.0,"I wear a size L in pretty much everything. Ordered an XL in this and I can't even get my arms down the sleeves. Order AT LEAST three sizes up if you want it to come anywhere close to fitting. The material is super thin and feels fairly cheaply made. It's unfortunate, because I really wanted to love this jacket, but it's just very typical fast-fashion."
2.0,Not the color shown it's suppose to be Hunter green and it was lime. Other then that not to bad but you get what you pay for with that price.
2.0,Runs small normally I have no issue with my normal size but this was so tight even squeezed my thighs. Otherwise the material was good
2.0,"The quality is thin and cheap feeling, and the cut is horrible. It didn't fit at all like the picture although I ordered the right size for my measurements. Not good for curvy girls I'm thinking, the material isn't stretchy enough for bigger hips. The color is off, too, way more blue in the stripes than it appears. Oh, and the cuffs were missing at the bottom; they looked like they were unrolled somehow. Already sent it back, but wanted to wrige a review in warning anyway."
2.0,These are ok for the price but not made very well.
2.0,Didn't care too much for this item as it got tangled real bad and broke before could really use it.
2.0,"Super cool, but not true to size. Needed a 2 got maybe an 6 or 4. Had to return."
2.0,"REALLY pretty, but sadly the earrings broke the second time I wore them. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"Sized for Junior not women, I ordered the Large too; hem of shirt is rough cut and tolls up, does not lay flat, returned same day received."
2.0,"The quality is fine. But if you are above a B, don't bother."
2.0,The glasses I received have a scratch on one lense and a serial number on the other that is marked on the plastic. It cannot be removed.
2.0,Cheap material that clings. I'm too tall for it. I'm 5'7 and it's up around my ankles.
2.0,"The small fits way too large. It’s about a size 3.<br /><br />Also, the print is not as nice in person."
2.0,"When I first got this, I was in love. It is an extremely versatile bag. It has lots of compartments, and I love that I can wear it as a backpack or purse. However, after about two months, it started to unravel by one of the side pockets. If it weren’t for that, I would absolutely give this five stars. However, I can’t give a product five stars if it doesn’t hold up very long with regular use. It’s not like I was putting a bowling ball in the backpack. It was basic stuff like pens, a wallet, some make up, etc.."
2.0,"These ended up a bit small for me, not sure I will even be able to use them."
2.0,"The color is as depicted in the pic online.  However, after the first wash it seems to be dark and lighter in places.  Can't see it in artificial light but shows in sunlight."
2.0,A little bulky for my taste. Buyer beware. Good luck getting a refund!
2.0,"I bought this exact same jean a couple of years ago, same size/color.  The ones I bought were made in Sri Lanka, these were made in Jordan.  I guess the sizes in Jordan are smaller — I would say these jeans are more of a size 4 than 6.  Will be returning."
2.0,"took over 30 minutes to swap my band for this one. Should be under 2 minutes. Ended up having to contort the band is such a way to provide enough pressure to fit the poorly formed end close enough to get the screw started. Seriously though about putting the watch for sale rather than put the new band on.<br /><br />Once on, the band feels fine. Softer than the last replacement i had and the buckle doesn't dig into my wrist. If it lasts 2 years, that'd be on par with both the suunto original band and the previous replacement I had."
2.0,"Smaller than expected, thin and flimsy. Doesn't have a flat bottom to stand up."
2.0,Son demasiado pequeñas de las pierna y muy grandes de la cintura
2.0,This would be great if you are fighting a dust storm in Australia but don't expect this single layer fabric to protect against germs.
2.0,"The material and the pocket designs are great. I really wanted to like these. I just hated the fit. The legs are very wide. They fit like wide suit pants and not like a pair of straight jeans. The waistband was very irritating on the skin they may need to be washed to soften them up, I don't know. I wore them around the house for a bit and I felt like a kid wearing my dads clothes. I am short (5' 8&#34;) and ordered the 30&#34; leg which was ok but maybe these are pants that work if you're over 6'. I was really disappointed because everything else was great about them."
2.0,"The colors are very nice and the material I love. Very comfy but the waist does not fit as expected for my size. ( Small) Everything else fits nice but the waist area it's too big, they fall down."
2.0,"Love the look, the fit is a little off on side that it fastens on.  But now, it is falling off and not staying on as expected."
2.0,Runs a little bigger then I expected. It would have cost more to tailor the dress so I’m returning it.
2.0,I unfortunately had to return it as it is completelly see through ... the fabric is very light and for the price I expected something better. Somehow it was agreable to wear as a lounge pant and I know white pants are see through but I really didn’t expect such a thin material
2.0,"Read all the questions about coloring bc in pic Jersey looks looks cream and burgundy which is why I brought it but it's not that color at all. Its bright white red, royal blue"
2.0,Did not fit. The packaging was very impressive but the choker itself was too small; we couldn't get the clasp anywhere close to being able to close. We'll have to buy an extender yo even be able to wear it. Very disappointing because my partner is a huge Slytherin fan
2.0,"i bought it this christmas as a gift for a close friend..she liked it very much coz it really looks nice but in less than a month, this friend emailed me saying that she needs to buy a new battery for the watch i gave her bec it bogged down, which embarrases me coz she was using it for like less than 3 weeks!now she thought it might be the batteries..we don't know yet the cause of it bogging down but i'm thinking of returning it so it can be replaced..maybe you guys could check first little details like those so as not to have customers be discouraged of purchasing from you again."
2.0,I bought these teeth for a party but they were very uncomfortable that i could even wear them.  Don't buy.
2.0,Cheap quality but my daughter wanted it
2.0,"I ordered a 20 inch chain and got an 18 in.  I also ordered 1mm.  I am not a jeweler, however. I don't how it could be any thinner without breaking.  The price was very reasonable, so I am keeping it"
2.0,"It is a cute watch, but not really water resistant.  The product info makes it seem you can wear it in the water, but the fine print suggests you don't."
2.0,"The bands seem high quality, but the edges stick out beyond my smaller version of the Apple Watch 3. They’re kind of sharp, so I wouldn’t recommend them for a smaller watch."
2.0,"These earrings are so cute but the “gold” was already very discolored when I opened them. I expected them to turn eventually—I mean, hey, they were $7 dollars. The hoops themselves are cute though, so I plan to just put them onto a different pair of studs. Still happy with this purchase overall!"
2.0,The shoes are adorable but VERY narrow and short.
2.0,"The flimsiest glasses I have ever seen. They look gorgeous, but I feel like I'm going to break them every time I touch them."
2.0,"This suit did not offer the coverage I needed up top. Pretty material, just made for someone a little smaller framed than me."
2.0,"Love these Jeans so much, and it pains me to say they are literally coming apart at the seams after just a few uses. They fit amazing, look great, feel great but dont hold up. If they were $5-10 I would invest in another pair but at $35 they should last longer than 3 weeks.<br /><br />2/24/19: Update- I really loved these, so much so that I took a second d chance on them in December and ordered a 2nd pair after my first pair ripped hoping I just got a bad pair. I'm super sad to say these had the same issue and the back ripped out again. They lasted a bit longer this time because I only washed them maybe 4 times. Unless you only plan on wearing these a few times I sadly wouldn't reccomend buying"
2.0,"Bought this shoe for my 7 yr. old in a size 2.5.  IT FITS ME and I wear an adult size 6.5.  So it's looking like this is going into the closet for about 6 years until she grow into them.  Also, very cheap quality and the size inside the shoe is not a US shoe size so i don't know what size I actually received."
2.0,"Item was too big. I've ordered this same size for other similiar items. However, this particular item was way too big. Didn't even stay up without me constantly pulling them up. after washing and drying, they were STILL too loose. However, I had lost some weight in the last couple of months. So, I do not really blame the company that I ordered them from."
2.0,"pros:<br />the band fit my inspire hr and was easy to attach.<br /><br />cons:<br />the band isn’t nearly as flexible as the original band and because of that, not as comfortable.<br /><br />and after wearing it one time, it’s already stained from my black t-shirt (an old t-shirt i’ve worn/washed too many times to count).<br /><br />very disappointed."
2.0,Poor quality of decoration on shirt. First wash already peeling.
2.0,This wallet was okay
2.0,"I loved the bracelet and the sparkle, but I could not move the adjusting ball with out two hands. Impossible to adjust while on my wrist. I had to return the bracelet even though I loved the look"
2.0,"3 pairs of these sunglasses all of which broke in the same place. Longest pair lasted about 6 months, shortest pair a week."
2.0,Just really cheap and flimsy looking. Not wearing it.
2.0,The bra part of the suit had no form or support.  Is an attractive suit.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:91239f903f9931ba54a9d018afb6c342]] These “Water Terrarium Earings” are advertised as a pair of “hand-blown glass ball(s), filled with water and green moss, and hung nicely on long ear wire”  which is a straight up lie. The ball is entirely hard plastic, with fake seaweed suspended unmovingly in the hardened material. The plants look very plastic. Seller wrote that “The green moss and water in the glass ball are in movement, looks like seaweed/ seegrass under the water,” which is another total lie. Nothing moves (as shown in my video) because this is not actually a mini water terrarium/aquarium. Also, the balls immediately broke off from the connecting caps after sliding them onto the wire earings, so I had to superglue them back together.<br /><br />Overall, the seller seems nice, but they misadvertised their product and I’m disappointed with this purchase. At least it was a fairly cheap product (around $6 total), although I probably should have taken the low price as a warning rather than a bargain. A little wooden bracelet and cologne sachet were included, which was thoughtful, and the product was wrapped very thoroughly in protective bubble wrap (although that was unnecessary considering it’s a dense plastic ball, not actual glass and water). At least I wouldn’t need to worry about the plant dying or the glass shattering if I wore them. But I don’t think I would wear these; the design is nice but the balls look very plastic and cheap."
2.0,"This fit strangely.  The armholes were too low, the sleeves bordered on tight, but the shirt itself was really big (especially through the waist.). The straps on the front are kind of too loose and look sloppy; I'd cut them off and just have the v-neck.  I didn't like this and am giving it away."
2.0,Please read the description carefully. It is a piece of plastic. It will be really hot wearing it in the kitchen or back yard.
2.0,These thongs were extremely small to the point where I couldn't wear them.  It's too bad because the material was good.
2.0,"Bought this to replace one that has worn out.  The brim is not 4 inches, more like 3 or at most 3 1/2.  The fit is smaller than I want, so I'm hoping it will stretch a bit.  It is too expensive for getting a smaller brim."
2.0,Bought it for my 3yr old but ended up wearing the beanie myself... its hugeee
2.0,Love love the flare sleeves but runs small..
2.0,"These are smaller than I expected, which is fine, but they’re also less substantial than I thought. The rainbow is very thin and feel sort of cheap."
2.0,Way too small for an adult. The stitching was all wrong on my mask. On top of that I felt like I was suffocating.
2.0,The color shown was not what I received.
2.0,Not for busty women
2.0,"Horrible,  you get what you pay for!!  I bought these to replace some just like them I had bought years earlier.  These game with bent posts and when i tried to straighten it out,  bye bye earring!!"
2.0,Shirt is way too short and does not fit well.
2.0,"It’s really cute, it’s cropped, so it doesn’t come all the way down to your hips, hits mid waist. But the arms were too tight & I ordered the xl, I don’t have really big arms so it was a bummer."
2.0,Two stars because these where way too large. Defiantly for a man.
2.0,The waist and round the ankle are poorly done I tried it on and they ripped off.
2.0,"I was shocked when this item arrived because the color is not at all what I wanted. Also, the medium is enormous on me. And not in a good way, all bulky under the arms. The neckline is really boat shaped so you would have to wear something underneath it. I didn't like the feel of it either, not at all like the picture. Very disappointed. Back it goes tomorrow."
2.0,This is a very bulky watch that has not been received well by my daughter. I knew it was a low quality watch but this is way worse then I expected.
2.0,"fabric is obviously very cheap. Very cool design, too bad..."
2.0,"nothing great about it,cheep product"
2.0,"Even though I attach the velcro strap through my bra strap, the shoulder pads slide around. I don't recommend ordering the petite. They seem too flat, not rounded enough to fit snugly on my shoulders. Very disappointing."
2.0,"i'm really really really disappointed! first it was extremely difficult to put.. second, does not look like the picture and finally the ear is injured trying to adjust and I can not return it because it would cost more than necessary"
2.0,Poor quality material. Wear it at home only.
2.0,This dress fits very large.
2.0,This band is fairly comfortable when you have it on but it's a pain to get on. It's hard to line it up with the correct hole and also tough to get the excess band tucked into the little slot. The biggest problem I had with it is that it was constantly pulling the hairs on my arm. I don't recommend it.
2.0,it was a good winder while it lasted but a year and a half after purchase one of the 4 winders stopped spinning. And now 3 months later a second has stopped. Now brookstone says I'm basically s*** outta luck. Oh well. Not buying their product again. Oh and by the way this is my second one that I've had that has stopped like this. Only recommend if you want something to last only a year or 2
2.0,This says loose fitting but it is not. The colors are pretty but mine was totally see through on my chest. So bummed.
2.0,Don't fit that great and fabric is too thin with a leg band that makes your skin stick out. Very unflattering. Will return.
2.0,These fit too tight.
2.0,"they broke super quick, you get what you pay for. Im not saying to go buy a $200 pair cuz that's not worth it either, but a $20 pair probably wouldn't have broken if I dropped them once."
2.0,"As pictured, but they did not last long. Unfortunately my daughter, who is typically very careful with her belongings,  broke both masks during her first week of school. The valve on both masks completely detached from the material. I would not recommend."
2.0,Don't purchase if you have a life proof case. Won't fit.
2.0,This hat/cover is hard to get a proper fit.  Keeps getting up in my eyes no matter what I do.
2.0,"Asian size, so order two sizes bigger than what you would in US."
2.0,Cute but WAY larger than it said. Order the tiniest size they have and you may be ok?
2.0,Liked them but one of them fell apart.
2.0,"These are just OK. Fabric is light, will be good for hot weather, fit is as expected. But reason I ordered them was the cell phone pocket, which is no good - it's way too small. In all shorts and leggings that feature a cell phone pocket, they picture it with the phone peaking out to highlight that feature - not with these, the picture is true to life, my iPhone 8 only fits 2/3 into the pocket, I guess it would work if I stayed perfectly still but I got these shorts to be active in, for jogging, hiking, gardening, activities where I want my phone with me and secure. No way these will work for that, I'll be checking on it every minute. And, there is only that one pocket - being so small no way you could carry a key, phone, and tissue. I'm keeping them, they were so inexpensive it's not worth the hassle trying to return."
2.0,"The dress was way too short! Not as expected; the size chart was way off. Also, the dress was shorter on the sides where the material gathered and longer in the front. Disappointed."
2.0,"Pretty, but definitely no room to stretch. A bit snug"
2.0,They did not fit☹
2.0,"Pretty, but the earrings were not reversed for each ear as shown."
2.0,"After wearing this watch for only about 10 days, the hour marker at 4 o'clock came off. It is now rolling around in the watch. I still love the look of this watch (which is why I gave it 2 stars) but I will exchange this particular model due to this defect."
2.0,dress too short but to big in all other areas
2.0,"Very, Very small - doesn't even fit my daughter :("
2.0,"Too bulky, Wished I had sent it back. I will probably give it away."
2.0,These things do not stay put.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these dishwashing gloves. I hate using dish sponges for sanitary reasons. I replace them every few days. So when I found these gloves, I was really excited to do away with sponges for good.<br /><br />I really tried to make these gloves work. After one week, I even ordered a replacement when they developed tiny tears in the fingers thus developing little pools of water in the fingertips and rendering these gloves useless at preventing my hands from getting soaked.<br /><br />The replacement did the same thing after another week. At this point, I’ll go back to wearing regular dishwashing gloves and sponges.<br /><br />On top of everything else, these gloves provide no grip. I actually broke a very expensive wine glass when they slipped straight through the glove. ARGH!"
2.0,CUTE DRESS HOWEVER VERY FITTED
2.0,The fit is very off. Arms are not proportional sized to the size.
2.0,came in early but gauge size smaller
2.0,Really cute and fit fine. Only issue is the actual cat face must not be actual steel. My ears are in constant break outs right behind the face - no issues with the piercing area itself. I wore it for as long as I could before I had to remove them. If you have allergies to metals I would not recommend this - and also shame on the details saying the item is only stainless steel!
2.0,Dislike MATERIAL....cheap and fit smaller than it should
2.0,"This is a very cute show, however the toebox was very narrow. I had to return them."
2.0,"Clasp on the top was sewn incorrectly. Colors were great, too bad quality control was poor."
2.0,"This is really really really long. Went past my knees (I am 5' 4"", 170 pounds) and ordered an XL"
2.0,"Well, these only work if SOMEONE ELSE is doing your hair.<br />I say this because it is basically impossible to part or even separate your own hair, unless you use a comb.<br />Ultimately I cut the tips off, now I can part and separate with ease."
2.0,"I didn’t like the fabric of this “nightshirt” On Amazon.com it seemed like it would be a soft, stretchy, comfortable knit. It was anything but! It turned out to be almost all polyester and  quite hotl I had to change it  before I went to sleep because I got very hot. In addition, it had not one bit of stretch! Even 3 or 4% spandex would have been SOMETHING!  I couldn’t move very comfortably in it. I really should have returned it but I am disabled and it’s just  too much trouble. I will give it to Goodwill,"
2.0,"These boots were so cute when they arrived, but they lasted one month before they started to fall apart.  Four months later in the the trash can.  It's not like they were worn everyday either.  Two stars is probably a bit generous but they sure were cute and sparkly."
2.0,"It was a cute dress but too small!! I had to pay to return it, I won't purchase from them again. I lost money, never fun!!"
2.0,"If you are a petite person with a small head, this hat is not for you.  Even though it says you can adjust it, it wasn't enough for me with a 20inch circumference. Lesson learned, best to buy hats at an actual store. Kmart had good ones and I ended up buying two there."
2.0,"Bought this set for a trip to Alaska..very disappointing...the interior packing space is smaller than a similar bag I have from another company.  Also the sides did not even last the first leg of the journey.  The outsides of the bags are peeling,  I have 7 more days to this trip.  Hope I have something left to pack in"
2.0,"I am an avid hiker and really wanted a more comfortable option over a hat or a toboggan. Once I was approved to review this item for a discount, I was totally excited. The only reason I was interested was because I kide and backpack and I would like an easy and comfortable way to stay warm. Here are my honest and unbiased reviews:<br /><br />* The headband fit well. I guess I have an average size woman's head and the fleece stretch was great that it stayed in place even with prolonged wear.<br />* The color is neutral so it matched everything. I really liked the fact that it didn't stick out from my regular hiking attire<br />* LOVED the ponytail feature! I have very fine hair and wearing rubber bands break off my hair. I LOVE that this is a gentle pull through without bindings for ponytails. It kept my hair out of my face and I was able to know I wasn't destroying my stands. That is a win - win for me!!<br /><br />CONS:<br />* It shielded my ears from the wind, but it wasn't really warm<br />* If you are a child, the width may be too wide for your head<br /><br />Overall, if you are a recreational hiker, this item will be good for you. It is also great to wear outside when a winter storm hits. As far as wearing it for hiking, camping, or backpacking in the cooler months..... this headband will not help. This is one of those things that I deem as an accessory.... in this case for the mom pulling back her hair."
2.0,Definitely not 18k gold.  A little on the bulky side. The design doesn't sit well on the decollete and the earrings are too heavy and pull down.
2.0,The material was thin and it was just okay. Wouldn't really buy again and go over moon recommending to anyone. Cost is good though.
2.0,This hat is very cute in person and has a wide brim to cover baby’s head and shoulders completely but was large in size. My baby’s head is in the 40th percentile being 2 months old and the hat was extremely large. Unfortunately I had to return this product
2.0,Hated it. It's a soft material like from the dollar store. See through
2.0,I ordered up two (2) sizes.  I wear 44 waist pants.  I am not crazy about these belts.  The leather feels more like &#34;pleather&#34;.
2.0,These run BIG.  Both my sons could not use them. 😐
2.0,"Really, really small, had to give to my little girl.yarn is nice, but looks cheaply put together."
2.0,"The poster was like the image, but like other reviewers, my package was missing 1 page of stickers."
2.0,Will not hold any of the three sized racquets that she has.
2.0,It’s not distressed at all.
2.0,"The style and fit of this dress are very nice.  However, the fabric in the back is so thin that it would show every single line if I try to wear underwear or even a slip underneath.  The front of the dress is two layers of fabric.  The neck line does not have a hem, which I actually like, because you can fold it however you want to give more or less coverage.  It fits well, size is as expected.  I would keep it if the back fabric was a little thicker."
2.0,Está bonito pero está roto el broche
2.0,"Product is poorly made. First and only time I used it, the clip on bow tie failed. The cummerbund is skimpy and narrow. The handkerchief is too small to be useful.  All in all, I would NOT RECOMMEND !!<br /><br />A product made for a price and it wasn't even worth the price paid for it"
2.0,"I was honestly really disappointed by the crooked stiching, I expected the cheap material and it lived up to the expectations. I thought the style was cute but production for this product was less than satisfactory. I'd save your 20 dollars and go to target, I wish I had."
2.0,Color was not as advertised. More like a khaki
2.0,Ordered 3x It’s too small<br /><br />My clothes are 1X in plus/16W
2.0,I should have looked at the sizing closer. Very! Large charm.
2.0,Super cute but a cheap material. Says machine washable but ripped down the back seam after ONE was
2.0,Does not look or feel like real leather. Looks cheap!
2.0,Seemed to be for very short and rotound figures.
2.0,"The flare is WAY too big on these. I purchased a size 0, which I have been at for a while now. The flare on the ends of these are bigger than the flare on my 00 plugs that I have bought for later. You’d have to stretch your ears 2 sizes bigger just to fit the flare in. However they are beautiful and the quality is pretty decent. I don’t know that I would wear them for an extended period of time, but they’re nice for once in a while. That is if you can get them in."
2.0,I wish I could get a replacement watch for my husband and get our money worth
2.0,"The beads fell off quickly,"
2.0,Within a week I have lost all the beads they are flat so they don't fit in the groove hole on the bead well
2.0,"I am 5'1"" and ordered the XXL size based on measurements chart. It was overall too small in everything but length. It was too long for my height. Unfortunately the fabric of the dress was less than desirable as well. It was very stiff and an unusual color. Instead of true black it was almost a very dark brown color."
2.0,After washing it it looks like it’s five years old it’s not sewn the best
2.0,"Just received gloves and my they are slightly tight and I got 2 left hands, which is very disapointing considering Halloween is soon."
2.0,"I bought these in a ""rosy brown"" color and the were very nice. When I got the navy ones, the color was not right and even the material felt different"
2.0,They fit perfectly so size is true BUT they lasted exactly 61 days and then they completely fell apart. The l.e.d. Lights stopped working after 2 weeks but after 2 months the toe part looked like a tongue flapping in the wind which when kids run is extremely dangerous. Fortunately my grandson just scraped his knees when the sole at the toe split open and curled under his foot. I still gave it 2 stars because of the true fit and design.
2.0,I guess you're not supposed to have hips or a butt to wear this top
2.0,It is a decent ring for the price it's just not what's pictured
2.0,doesnt look that good
2.0,These shorts are very short. I was expecting a 12 inch inseam. They are 12 inches total from waist to bottom of shorts. I will continue to look for a more suitable fit.
2.0,Dislike that the bottom part was detached....
2.0,"Decepcionada con la pijama, pedí una talla s que parece talla l y llegó rota, sumamente decepcionante."
2.0,fair at best. quickly developed hole at the seams.<br />would not buy again
2.0,These are great for the price but they are VERY THIN. SO you need to be careful. I'm going to have to buy more 20mm spring bars but I'm going to keep the set for the future but I do feel these could be unsafe.
2.0,While these shorts are cute in person the sizing is way off. I ordered a large which is my normal size and I couldn’t even button them. Even though the waist is really small the legs are wide so I’m afraid if I sized up to make the waist fit the legs would just be ridiculously huge. I was bummed that these didn’t work.
2.0,Fits to loose
2.0,"I like the picture, but when it arrived it was just too big and heavy for my needs, so I sent it back. It's beautiful."
2.0,Totally cheap material and looks nothing like the shirt in the picture.
2.0,Very cheap material it almost feels like plastic. The white is completely see through. You also would have to iron it with every use. Looks more like a cheap costume than a dress.
2.0,"It's, maybe, .5mm too wide?... This causes the back to bulge just enough to fit poorly around the camera and the center clips on the bottom will not hold the bottom edge flat resulting in a 1mm gap. The leather portion is not much more than a sticker that doesn't cover the whole back.<br />Finally shipping took 16 days to arrive. All that said the qi charger does work!"
2.0,"Material not as expected. Kinda cheap, and ugly. Thought they were sweat pants with good thick material. They are stretchy and loose. Not my style."
2.0,"Just as the title says, the small shirt doesn't run like most, it was too big."
2.0,Material is to thin and you can see through i will not buy this brand again.
2.0,I love leather coats and have had several<br />Real and pleather items.  Just because it’s pleather doesn’t mean it can look and feel real.  It’s just not heavyweight enough to hold the flaps and belts in place
2.0,"I got this hat twice, once in a Med./lg., then extra large. Both hat were to small and are miss labeled."
2.0,This is shown as a long skirt. It is actually a mini skirt revealing the full leg.
2.0,It's a beautiful dress but way too short for me I'm 5'7. I was hoping it would look good
2.0,"They are super cute, but the elastic is scratchy and the sizing is way off. I wanted these to be comfy for sleeping, so I even ordered two sizes larger than I needed. Nope, too tight around the waist and the elastic is painfully rough. The leg holes are comfortable but they ride up. I'm a size 6/8 about 148lbs and the XL was not a good fit. Price is too high too for this quality."
2.0,"I bought pj's for grandson. He usually wears 2T's. I ordered 3ts thinking he will grow into quickly. Unfortantly the 3Ts where small and fit like 2Ts. Pjs are cute, made well, I would buy 2 sizes bigger if I was to buy again."
2.0,I had to take the rosary to a jeweler.  One of the links broke.  I know that it somewhat delicate.  This is after purchasing a leather pouch to put it in.  I do enjoy the feel of the wood though being a carpenter.  I would not have bought it if I had handled it prior to buying it.
2.0,"Not too happy with this purchase. The fabric is very cheap and they do not fit right. Very loose around the foot, but too tight around the thigh. The only reason I didn't return these is because I need them for my Halloween costume and it would be a hassle to try to find more stockings like these."
2.0,"They feel very synthetic and are heavy (not as in ""thick"" but as in they weigh a lot).  Also run very long in the leg and sleeve."
2.0,Pretty looking but cheaply made. The strings are popping out already. And I've only worn it once or twice. So very disappointing. I would not recommend this for daily use. Next time I will bit from a different company
2.0,The color of the fur is not even close to the picture I ordered khaki and it’s more like an orange.
2.0,"I really wanted these to work but unfortunately, they did not. They are super soft and when I pulled them out I could not wait to try them on. They almost came up to my waist but did not make it there. I'm wondering if I ordered the wrong size and or shape type. I looked at the charts and chose what I thought most described what I resemble but apparently something was off. I just want to know what shape on their charts I would fall into. They are so soft and I'm so disappointed they didn't fit."
2.0,"This looked adorable on and was flattering, however, it was sheer. Completely sheer. so i had to return it."
2.0,Half of them came with dead batteries
2.0,Huge! Stiff not comfortable to wear even after several washings
2.0,"I like the look of it, but it&#34;s made very cheap, which it is. I'm going to fine a better quality one, and gladly pay more for a better made one because I like the look. But it looks like what its worth, cheap."
2.0,Returned because it was more of a hot pink color than red. Wouldn’t really consider it unisex either.
2.0,"Very hard to put on watch due to , to much material"
2.0,Arrived in a good time frame but the side pieces don't close all the way so they stick out. Over the ear pieces are rough so they catch in your hair and pull hair out when you remove. Would be great for Carp shooting just think I got a bad pair.
2.0,"Love the pattern on these pants, but they were very baggy on me.  Disappointed."
2.0,These shirts fit veeeery snug and are also pretty cheap feeling
2.0,This is a very cheap quality dress which for the price you would expect. It does look very cute on.  I’m 5’6 and weight 155lb. Bottom part fit perfect but was too big at the top. Dress isn’t made for dancing. Material is very cheap. I’ll be returning.  I would recommend this dress for a theme/costume party more than anything else.
2.0,"The only thing I can say about these capris is that I like the style. Unfortunately, that is it. They do NOT fit at all. Moreover, I would not say that they fit at all. They are too tight, period. I love the fabric and there are side pockets on the pants. The bottom legs are a little wide, which I love. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I usually wear a medium in Calvin Klein tops.  Ordered a small after reading the reviews, but it was still one size too big!  I never, ever wear an extra small, but definitely should have ordered an extra small in this one."
2.0,I was surprised at how thin it is.
2.0,They are very thin and for my husband who works all day on his feet in steal toed boots; these socks were a bad choice.
2.0,It looked very cheap and I had really high hopes because my nephew is a musician but I was almost imbarrassed to give it to him for Christmas.
2.0,"I was easy to put and take off but the screen lost all sensivity. So i couldnt use my watch while using the case. Good price, maybe can use it for protection in travels or when its stored."
2.0,Pic is of mask before it is sewn together. Once it's together there is a pleat on the word government. Can't make out the first and last 2-3 letters.
2.0,"Se ve totalmente distinto en persona en relación a las fotografías, no lo recomiendo."
2.0,This dress is cute but it’s too tight around the arms
2.0,Its pretty design but was so thick couldnt breath felt like i was going to passout after half hour of wearing.
2.0,Great quality but I had to reorder a larger size
2.0,Very small did not represent size posted
2.0,Very cheap! Not a fan
2.0,My son wore it for a couple games but finally threw it out bc it literally melts on your face running down turning your entire face grey- better off using a wide tip waterproof eyeliner-
2.0,This is a great looking jacket however it is extremely large in the torso.  The arms fit as you would expect a wetsuit to but the torso floats like an outerwear jacket.  We bought a medium (same as all other wetsuit items he owns) for my brother 5'7&#34; 155lbs athletic frame.  We could easily fit pillows inside it once zipped.  Would be great for husky men maybe.
2.0,She died before it got here. Still sealed in the bag
2.0,Cute but WAYYYY TOO SMALL! ORDER 2 SIZES BIGGER THAN WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO. (I did one) and it STILL didnt fit!! very cute though on the other hand.
2.0,🤷
2.0,"The shirt is sized much wider then usual and the cotton material is very stiff even after a washing, not soft whatsoever. I ordered a 3x and it was much more like a 4x wide buy a 2x length (after initial washing)...awkward sizing. This shirt is not at all the proportionate appearing shirt as in the photo!"
2.0,Size fits smaller than expected. Got my child birthday gift and is too small.
2.0,"I ordered this bag through the website because it showed it was Plaid with Pink....photo showed color as well. When it arrived the Pink has now been replaced by RED.  Not a big deal, if you didn't buy it for the color.  I could have bought it anywhere if I wanted it in black....but my daughter requested the pink plaid....which I found and thought I bought.  Why bothering having photos with different colors on the website, if you are not going to sell them by the color...substitutions available??  I knew the bag would be great as I have had it in my  hand at other stores....but I wanted to get the color requested....I know red will not bring the smile to her face that I was hoping for. Very disappointing."
2.0,"Enjoyed it for what it was, but was a bit too pricey for everything it contained. The vest was the most useful thing in here, and for the longest time I couldn't get the headlamp to work. There was an issue with the button not fully pressing down and felt rather cheap, and when I did eventually get it to work the battery was only good for about 2 hours of continuous use (I used brand new batteries, not the ones included with the kit). There was also an issue with the red LED emitters, only 1 of the 2 functioned. I didn't bother returning it or making much of a fuss as my Ragnar relay event was two days away. I managed to run all 33 miles in the night time by borrowing my teammates headlamps. All in all, I was not very pleased with the product and was far more expensive than the sum of its parts."
2.0,This is a very strange fit....”normal” in the waste and ever area except for the legs. They fit like tight bike shorts in the legs (on a thin teenager).  The rest of the shorts fit like casual shorts....the material<br />Is very soft and nice colors but the legs are tight which makes the rest baggy.  Returned 4 pairs unfortunately.
2.0,"My 3.5 year old daughter was so excited about this set, and crushed when 2 pieces of jewelry broke right out of the box. The blue tiara snapped when I bent it to put on the headband. The shoes were way too small as well. Very disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Not made for adult sized head
2.0,Does not fit snug
2.0,"material to rough and see through thin, also too small.<br />Based on above I could not review wearing it other than it was itchy, too tight to wear buttoned up, material  felt very inexpensive."
2.0,Does not fit properly.  Made more for a small person.
2.0,Cup sizes smaller than expected order a cup or two bigger. Not good quality material disappointed!
2.0,"Bandana it self are nice, but the hair band ones don't fit nice, the elastic is not tight enough and falls off your hair."
2.0,Loved the color but it’s too small and they only come in one size
2.0,I guess just don't get the handwriting font because you can barely see the names.  It's so thin and small you'd never know there were names on it
2.0,I was disappointed with the fit usually I am true to size but this dress did not fit well at all. The cuffs are too small on the sleeves can’t wear this.
2.0,not big diference
2.0,"Definitely the quality you pay for: this &#34;suit&#34; is not meant for busty women. I ordered a size large, I'm a 36D, I'm 5&#34;6 and weigh about 170 lbs so I'm very too heavy and curvy with a big bottom as well. The bottoms (black) fit like a dream! The quality sucks, don't get me wrong, you get what you pay for, BUT the black bottoms did look like the photo: almost fit like a shape wear type of bottom which works wonders on my hourglass figure. If you don't mind paying the price, the bottoms are worth it I'm keeping them and buying a top to match with it later. Now the top was, as everyone else describes, a hassle. Even if I had sized up it would've been unfair since the bottoms wouldn't have fit well so what's the point? Putting the top on was impossibly hard and really hurt my skin and my breasts, it didn't fit at all whatsoever anyway you put it. It has 5% spandex but isn't very stretchy at all. I literally had to grab a pair of scissors and physically cut myself out of it because I couldn't get it off without damaging and hurting my skin from the pulling and yanking. All in all, if you're petite and slender and relatively straight sized this will work for you; if NOT, then please read these reviews before making your purchase. I wouldn't purchase this again."
2.0,"This top looked great on the Amazon web site.  When it arrived, I found it to be a little too sheer for my comfort.  Returned and received credit."
2.0,One of the two loops rings that secure the strap tore off after a few weeks. It's just a matter of time until the other one breaks
2.0,The top of the dress fit nicely but the body (especially the front of the dress) made me feel like I was trying to hide something. Would have been beautiful if the front wasn't 2 times too big
2.0,"I love the look but a stone fell out immediately.  I glued back in but somehow, that just ruined the purchase for me."
2.0,"Considering the reviews on these leggings I was expecting much better quality. Thin material, definitely not to be worn without something covering your butt/front because it would be see through for sure.<br />If your'e looking for nicer leggings for yoga/exercise/everything, try Zella. You can get them on Ebay, typically around $40, but after trying these leggings the $40 is well worth it. Zella's leggings are way thicker and more reliable."
2.0,Not what I was expecting.  For $17.50 it looks very cheap. Shipping took FOREVER
2.0,After first wash looks very outwashed. The same piece in black looks much better and stays the same after the wash.
2.0,Bought four of these for bridal party. Shoddy construction on some. Turns wearers necks green.
2.0,These socks are very very thin. They also hurt in between the toes in most active classes because they are not true to size. They are poorly made. After wearing them 2x in my barre class the rubber on the bottom is starting to come off and the stitching round the ankle is unraveling. I would definitely not get them again. It's. Shame because they are cute looking.... but that's all.they have going for them
2.0,picture isn’t what it shows! should have read the reviews. all the crystals are yellow and a lot smaller than it seems.
2.0,"It arrived damaged with a missing hinge and chips, it appears that it was a damage/return from a previous customer.  I was very disappointed and returned it.  I am re-evaluating whether I want to repurchase it.  It looks very nice, but this experience has a left a bad taste in my mouth."
2.0,It looks good but my son is 12 and usually wears 12-14. This would fit a size 8 comfortably
2.0,Very small is not size 7.
2.0,"Compared to other dresses from similar manufacturers,  this dress is way tight in the arms and chest.  Due to the border piping design, there is no give so limits motion and makes for tight fit. If you work out or have arms that are not sticks, this may be a bit tight.  Chest fit is way too small unless you're an A or small B cup. I am a normal C cup and it's a bit busty for work. Too bad. Really liked the design.  Other dresses bought on Amazon fit great!"
2.0,Loved it. I would've given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I received it torn in the front
2.0,"I found this shoe to be too sparkly and too bright--almost garish. In addition, the shoe is best for a wider foot and the strap is scratchy.  However, it is the material glued to the insole that my granddaughter found most annoying--do a close up of the inside of the shoe before purchasing.  Not sure that I will return them, as we live in another town, but I certainly was not elated with my selection"
2.0,The quality of the leather seems off - as does the construction. Nothing like the pair I got a few years ago - they were and are still beautiful and functional - I just wanted another color. Oh well. I”m sorry about this because I was so pleased with my old ones and these were not up to snuff. Two stars for being... gloves and prompt delivery.
2.0,"Honestly, the quality matched the price. I was trying to be thrifty, but was hoping for thicker material than these are made from.  If you want inexpensive leggings to wear under flow tops or dresses, these might satisfy you, but order a couple of sizes up. There was not as much stretch and I expected and the medium sized ones did not go over my medium-sized thighs."
2.0,Pro:<br />The lights were great.<br />Cons:<br />The clips are terrible.<br />Can’t change colors or recharge the battery.
2.0,"These pants fit everywhere except in the length. Way to short! I'm 5'9"" and these were about 4"" too short! Ridiculous! My daughter is shorter and she likes them so she gets them. The pants are fairly thin and light. They appear to be put together okay but they're not of the best quality. I think they're too expensive for the quality."
2.0,The letters are huge on the bride and groom masks the colors were very off as well
2.0,"Nice ring but Mich too small for a nose ring, it would be good for a lip ring or a very small nose"
2.0,It broke when i wore it out. This isnt much of an everyday bracelet either. Paint  chipped off the rose and im lucky my wrist are so small i was able to just attach the chain to an other part and make it work. You get what you pay for. Its cute but if I can only wear it once its not worth it
2.0,"Best thing to say, you get what you pay for.  Thin and cheaply made."
2.0,somewhat disappionting. The shirt itself it precious
2.0,"This dress looks nothing like the photo. Very plain cut. Nice fabric, but not chic."
2.0,The product does not match the image included with the listing.
2.0,The material was extremely stiff and the lace was scratchy.  I returned it the same day.
2.0,The necklace came in the package it was shipped in. No extra packaging and this is very disappointing. Looks very cheap and the necklace looks like a kids necklace
2.0,The synthetic smell could be sensed throughout the house for days after I opened the package.<br />I could not allow a child to wear this mask close to their face! :(
2.0,This dress is thick and heavy and weighs the dress down. So it doesn’t fits well.
2.0,"Although it is super cute, the T-shirt is very small and the pants too big. I bought the 12 months old size for my 9 months old baby and with the T-shirt he was showing the belly button while the pants were falling down."
2.0,"While this shirt fit well, it was very clingy and seemed to highlight all faws and imperfections, such as"
2.0,Flimsy material<br />I will return it
2.0,I love the print on this shirt but it’s definitely not green. More of a pale blue. I like it but quality control seems to be lacking as there’s a large hole in front. Here’s hoping the replacement is damage free.
2.0,I usually wear a medium (6-8) in bottoms but got a large in this shirt and it was still entirely too small. I would order 2 sizes up at least.
2.0,"I was very hopeful about these gloves.  The material and construction is of a good quality .. but they were definitely not waterproof.  The first time my index finger touched a small puddle of water, it was inside the glove at the seem.  Later, when using them in the rain, they were soaked through within minutes.  I had to switch gloves before my hands got cold.  I wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,If you are above 5.6 this Dress is way too short and not flattering
2.0,Constantly fell off my head.. I bought them for work and they’re pretty much useless as I spent so much time readjusting them
2.0,too tight on my little guy.
2.0,"Thin material. Stretchy, snug fitting."
2.0,Cute! Took a long time to arrive but Cute! You get what you pay for...
2.0,"For $20 ..what would you expect?  The dress was not exactly as described.. For some reason I thought the poka dots were smaller...but that was okay.  Its not really &#34;backless&#34; ....I am 5'8&#34; and weight 182....I didn't read the reviews until after I had purchased..so I was actually thinking I was going to return it..but upon arrival I immediately tried it on and have decided to keep it.  We live on the beach and I live in sundresses...this will be a perfect item to throw on after a day in the sun..I wouldn't call it an evening dress!  I would wear it out to dinner, etc...we live in a beach community which is very casual...material was certainly not a cotton blend, but its comfortable.  I think is was a good value for the money....but probably would not order another one!"
2.0,"Cute in pictures, but in person it was cheap looking. Wasn’t a fan of the material. Chest area was too blousy. Returned it."
2.0,"Really liked the fabric but the design is inherently flawed - unless the top of your ears are below your eyes. So if you look at the design, it’s basically a straight gaiter with some ear holes cut into it - and that’s the problem. With the gaiter hooked on your ears the front side naturally rides super high on your face (or over your eyes). When you pull down the front to where it’s not in your eyes, it actively pulls down on your ears which is pretty annoying."
2.0,"hmmmmm... While the shape & style hold some attraction for me, these sunglasses are SUPER lightweight - and not in a good way.  These (for lack of an eloquent term) are constructed of cheap plastic and give me zero sense they would hold up with any less than mindful care.  The &#34;gold&#34; on the bridge, side tabs, the arms and especially the nose pads are bright-shiny gold.  The black is a glossy plastic.  These seem more like a pair you'd pick up at a Dollar Store for a quick-disposable-only-in-emergency pair of shades.<br /><br />I will keep them in my car in the RARE instance that I've forgotten my prescription sunglasses as I can put them on over my clear prescription glasses for a temporary situation.  My vision is somewhat distorted with them this way and the sunshine block is pretty mild.<br /><br />They arrive in an attractive black box with OLIEYE in a handsome lettering, a chunky lightweight black plastic case with a snap, and a cleaning cloth.  (something you wouldn't get included at a dollar store...but then, these sunglasses feel so vulnerable and temporary, they don't say &#34;take good care of me&#34;)<br /><br />I would be okay paying $1 for these in a pinch."
2.0,"I tried to cancel it but they would allow me to. It only lasted about 1-2 weeks and then it broke. It took long delivery and the product at 8 dollars yet the total was 20 because of shipping? Don’t recommend but it’s cute, just takes too long."
2.0,"There is nothing wrong with the dress itself, I just don't like the color I ordered."
2.0,Bought product as a 5xl fits like a 3xl
2.0,has little pom pom tassels on the sleeves and bottom
2.0,The gold is very bright. Seems very costumish.
2.0,"Didn't fit the way I needed it to, but its sturdy. The red is not as deep as the picture"
2.0,They run small and don't have alot if give to stretch.  Look nice though
2.0,fit is odd and crumbled in center; material has a nice soft texture yet seems to be made  cheaply. I like the color and likely wear with long tee-shirts.
2.0,Light only lights a court of numbers
2.0,They were much smaller than I expected
2.0,How the seller has this listed is VERY misleading. You think your getting 60 of each. In reality your getting 100 feathers and onlly 20 dream catchers.
2.0,"Looks nice but made my ears itchy and painful, and I wear stainless steel earrings all the time. Couldn't wear them, had to give up."
2.0,small and very thin. not worth the money!!
2.0,Doesn't snug face like you'd want. Moves when you talk increasing exposure.  Think it would work better for children
2.0,Doesn't fit for me
2.0,"Cute dress. Cotton material, almost knee length and does hug body; usually size fit me a little snug. Returned because not as described: color not as navy or dark as picture shows."
2.0,Poor quality. Feels and looks like the baggy dresses girls have to wear in school choirs. Very unflattering.
2.0,I guess I don't like that it's only 1 earring. Why only 1?  It took forever to arrive and I can't use 1.
2.0,The ones that came in my package are so small you need a magnifying glass to see them. Much different than the picture and reviews I have been seeing.
2.0,"Edit: i ordered the small size in another color, and decided the small fits WAY better. So I reordered the small in this color for my maternity photoshoot dress, got it today, and the flowers are pink instead of white!! I'm truly devastated, and dont think another will come in time.<br />Original review: I'm 5'4, 135 pounds, and 22 weeks pregnant, so i decided go get a medium. I could've probably still fit in a small, but the medium is perfectly fine. I do have to pin the bust area together so that it doesnt fall, but other than that this dress is very stunning, gorgeous, and super flattering. The price is unbeatable, and the style is perfect. It just needs a good steam after opening the package. I'd get this dress without hesitation. :)"
2.0,I didn't like the material. It doesn't breath well. Made me sweat too much. Also the neckline was an awful cut.
2.0,pretty and light but too much fabric under that belt!
2.0,"5’11”,165lbs- I purchased the A2 and the pants were perfect! The top however is SO baggy in the front shoulders. I’m afraid it’ll become a “pull-up bar” for someone if they picked up on it. I was going to return it but I kinda missed the boat. 😬"
2.0,"Didn't block anything. just a regular pair of glasses. but they look close to tony starks, $12 for a Halloween accessory isn't bad"
2.0,Dislike: it began to tarnish after one wear. The gold tone was noticeably 2 shades darker then the pendant.
2.0,These were so big on my face I couldn’t even wear them.
2.0,two small. child sized
2.0,The xl fits like a small.
2.0,I really liked them at first but within a month all the cushion had gone flat.  I am disappointed.
2.0,"This is the second pair that ripped, not sure i could recommend this product."
2.0,This mask was too thick and heavy for me.
2.0,Tore the first week I had them.
2.0,Really horrible style hat
2.0,I feel like I wasted my money. Not bright at all. Lights up a little at the bottom then fades out quickly. Instructions say not to fold tie but it arrives folded. Avoid.
2.0,"Not for a person with big boobs!!! This outfit would be super sexy if my tits weren’t falling out of the bottom. This is a size medium, I have 34DDD"
2.0,Nice material but sizing is misleading . Had to return
2.0,"The metal surface of the studs is too slick to grip and screw into the backing, and the rod of the hoops is nearly too short to pass through your ear lobe and then secure into itself."
2.0,"I'm so sad about this dress. The length is perfect, the polka dots are adorable (larger than in the pictures), but the chest area is tiny. I'm 5'6.5&#34; and wear a 38B. I ordered a Medium in the navy polka dot and I suppose I should have ordered a large. There's no way I could wear this dress with a bra, which I'm not opposed to, but the dress squishes my girls. Honestly, they look like flattened bananas! The material is also not quite what I was expecting. I guess I should have read the product description more, but it's a polyester(?) and not very soft. Very cute dress and the pockets are adorbs. Unfortunately returning :("
2.0,"My husband wears between large and XL  on almost all shirt/coat/suits he owns. But this jacket, while is nice and well worth the price, is way under sized. We returned the XL for the 2XL and even the 2XL is small. The torso is slightly bigger but the arm holes and sleeves are the same size. I would not purchase if you have ever lifted a weight before."
2.0,Face features good.  Very cheap looking hair.  Distorted shape.  Returned.
2.0,"Cute jacket, sizing is WAY off.  Not recommended."
2.0,This top was way to small and the quality left a lot to be desired.  I returned it.
2.0,"This cover is so cute in the picture but doesn't look like this in real life. It doesn't have the same shape as on the model. I do like the material. I ended up keeping it to wear around the house but would definitely not wear it to work, which was my original intention."
2.0,They need to have a little bit more room.
2.0,Shoe is not well made and sized smaller.
2.0,"On the second day of using this purse, one of the handles came off the purse.  It wasn't actually adhered to the purse, it was just clipped in with two flimsy clips.  I stuck the clips back in the holes, I've had to do that a few times already today.  On the third day the shoulder strap stitching started to separate.  I don't know how long this purse will last.  The handles will probably give out before the purse body does."
2.0,I really like the way this watch works but one thing I have had trouble with is getting the compass to calibrate I have tried it many times in a field out in the open and it still does not seem to work well. The other functions are fine except the compass.
2.0,Really disliked the fabric. Felt very cheap
2.0,Product doesn't for as shown. A lot shorter than advertised. And doesn't sit on shoulder as pictured
2.0,"I purchased this dress to wear at work, but when I tried it on you could see straight through it. It looked nothing like the photo."
2.0,"Ordered this trip since I am fair skinned and was going on a trip to the Bahamas.  Shirt fit as described and was good for wearing in the water as it did not bubble up like a lot of shirts do.<br /><br />Unfortunately on my second wear, the shirt got a large hole on the back...I did not do anything particularly harsh with the shirt except go in the ocean so I was disappointed that the shirt was not more durable.<br /><br />In terms of sun protection, the shirt did its job and I did not get burnt on the trip, however I was disappointed that the material was not tougher and the shirt ripped so easily.  Disappointed-- I tried reaching out to Coolibar custom service via email and have not heard back."
2.0,"this fit like a women's 10, not a men's."
2.0,Received a used item.  It was on sale but did not say it was used. It did not have any tags and smelled as somebody’s perfume. I was going to give it as a gift but now can’t do that. Decided to wash and keep it since it was very cheap.
2.0,I read the reviews about this shirt running small so I ordered the next sz up.  Should have gone up two sizes.
2.0,too small. thight. does not fit me. but it's not a bad looking sunglasses.
2.0,"Bought these glasses to wear for work. They keep falling off. Constantly touching my eye area to straighten them, not something we should be doing in a pandemic. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,I wanted to like it but I had to apply several layers to make it show. Wont be buying again
2.0,"Brought this for my 5 yr old.  It was to big and will not stay on her face but she wont let me give it to soneone who can use it because she loves the ballerina puctures nd hoping soon she will grow into it.  It took a very long time to come, i forgot i even ordered it.  I put it on my face and it fit."
2.0,"My son is 6’1” and in any other clothing he takes a men’s medium. This is very wide, it looks baggy on him. The material is great, but for the price I feel it should fit better."
2.0,Bought these earrings for a particular outfit to wear this weekend (14th and today is the 11th) but sadly they are broken. A lot of missing beads.
2.0,Little
2.0,"Very small, more like a garment from China. Other than that, they are soft and seem to be made okay. Good thing they fit my teenager or I would have to return them."
2.0,I got wrong size.
2.0,"The material is good and I like that it allows your crotch to breathe, but I've got a plump derriere and this doesn't cut it for me. Went a size up and it gets scrunched up."
2.0,"Diaper bag looks like it good quality but it’s not so practical. It’s much smaller than it look in the pictures. There’s no way you could get diapers, wipes , toys, extra outfit, bottles , formula and snack in there.<br /><br />Looks nice and could use as purse but needs to be bigger"
2.0,"I love it, but it keeps coming apart. :-(<br />I've had to put it back together 4 times. The leather pieces keep coming out of the metal.<br />I know it wasn't vary expensive, but it would have been nice if it didn't come apart with in a week."
2.0,Nice fabric. Not see through. BUT it does seem like you need to have the longest upper body. 5’5. Wearing an XL. The bow is very short when tied so smaller than expected.
2.0,Stretched out.
2.0,"Nice shirt.... Runs small.  I normally wear a small, ordered the medium still way too small.  Gave it to my daughter, looks great on her."
2.0,uhhh.... really really to small... i ended up giving it to my 13 year old niece... no kidding
2.0,"I bought these twice. Sizing up the second time because I thought the stitching on the front weird from being too small. I was wrong, the puckering below the pockets looks like this standing, sitting, lounging, walking. If you have thicker thighs, you’re not going to get that ‘jogger’ look. In the plus side they are stretchy and very comfortable for sure."
2.0,Colors look different
2.0,"I was disappointed because none of them fit the two bracelet watch ands I have. The holes were way too small, & I should have paid attention to the other reviews."
2.0,Not stitched. False advertising. Don’t buy.
2.0,"My wife loved it at first, but the silver plating started coming off exposing the copper it's actually made of in just 2 days of wearing it!"
2.0,"I wasn't very pleased with this dress when I received it. The picture is different from the dress. It was an awkward fit because the front has a nice band that accentuates the waist when looking from the front but when you turn to the side or back the thick band disappears and becomes an elastic band which cinches the dress up taking away the structured look it had in the front. Then bust line was too, I had some seams loose and strings hanging. Looked like a rushed job. Not impressed at all."
2.0,about 1 size or 2 too small but cute
2.0,Shoulder area is very wide and so it almost falls off. Otherwise it fits.
2.0,"Bought for work.  Nose pads fell off after very limited use, at which point they got tossed in the trash"
2.0,"nothing special, meh!"
2.0,Sleeves need to be made large at the top because the material has no give in it. Larger people have larger arms than the average person.
2.0,"it was fun while it lasted, turned yellow within two days. waste of money"
2.0,The wrap that the shoes were shipped in worn the toe of the shoes. Shoe fit is very wide.
2.0,Pretty until I mildly sweated off and on for couple hours and it tarnished. I understand it’s just costume jewelry but I’ve had more than my share of costume jewelry in past and never tarnished and turn green this quick.
2.0,"UGLY & CHEAPLY MADE! I had to put that in all caps to stress that this bag does not look like the image. I ordered my a job interview but had it arrived to my apartment and not my leasing office screwing me out of using it, I would have been too embarrassed to take it. The tag indicates that it's made in China so yeah, crappy stitching and cheap fabric."
2.0,The fit was extremely too big according to your measurement on your web site.
2.0,"My daughter was so excited to get these earrings, they are very beautiful and came in a nice box. However... In order to get them to stay put you basically have to bend them to the size needed. They also fell off within a few minutes of wearing them. Not worth the price!"
2.0,Mehhhhh kinda girly
2.0,"If you are plus sized, especially with large breasts or ANY type of belly or hips, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! I bought the largest size and it was still too small ( I am 5'7 and wear 18-20 pant, 2XL top, and size 38DDD bra).  There is absolutely NO room for plus sized curves."
2.0,"Small was still too big around back, stomach and chest area. Even after pulling halter as tight as I could.  I’m a C-D cup. But the seam with the elastic to hold the back up was not as tight as it should be.  The bottom of the suit was fine. I’m 110pounds. 5’4"
2.0,Bought an xL but it was a large
2.0,I really liked these pants and they fit pretty good but the last time I wore these I was at costco and was picking up some soda boxes and the bottom ripped out. Good thing I had some underwear on. I mean a really big rip. So if you plan on doing anything where bending is required these are not the ones you want.
2.0,These don't look like the picture. They are misshapen and odd. I hated them the moment I put them on.
2.0,I'm not sure why my slit looks like this but it is a huge disappointment.  I have a wedding just a few weeks away so I'm not really sure what to do :(
2.0,runs WAAAY too small!!!
2.0,"Looked like a really cute dress but it had tons of strings all over it, the stitching was coming out as soon as we opened it and it ended up shrinking. I kept it cause it was for my daughters birthday party and we didn’t have time to order anything else. Really disappointed."
2.0,"One of the lady bugs was defective. This was the only pair I was really concerned about.  A few of the others were not centered, one of the backs wouldn't stay on any of the earrings. Very cheap quality.  You definitely get what you pay for."
2.0,I think they would be great if they worked. I can see to read from them but the other levels is not correct.
2.0,"Very pretty, but the third butterfly on each snapped off when my daughter tried to secure to her ear! Couldn’t wear!"
2.0,"No , plastic"
2.0,I wear size 7 in Born boots/shoes all the time. There were way too narrow.
2.0,"The skirt is so cute, but it was way too small for me. :("
2.0,"I ordered the largest size, I am a size sixteen..... The dress was maybe a size ten! This dress looks loose and long on their model, measure carefully!"
2.0,"La correa se deshilacha, no parecer ser cuero."
2.0,My daughter is at school as we speak. She texted me 2 hours ago saying it broke already we just got it yesterday. Da filter is trash she didn’t like it
2.0,"Very cheaply made, falls apart after one wash in the machine."
2.0,"La tela no es lo que esperaba, tiene una especie de satinado que no se aprecia a simple vista. La etiqueta dice lino y algodón."
2.0,The lights on the left shoe looks yellow but the light on the right shoe looks blue.
2.0,Such a weird fit. The waist band comes up to bra. There's zero compression and they're very loose in the knees and ankles especially. I got the smallest size s/m
2.0,"They are nice and fit well. I ordered a second pair because the tiny eye glasses screw came out of the first pair after using 3 times. If I could ever find a replacement screw , I would have a nice back up pair.  That's the only reason they are not a 5 star in my opinion.  Yes , I would buy again if I had to."
2.0,"Loved this perfect size contemporary look, until the strap came off on one side the day after I bought it."
2.0,"It actually is much bigger than it looks and looked rather cheap. I returned it.It might be ok for everyday but not an evening purse and though it is larger than you would think, it doesn't really hold much."
2.0,"The cut is just off - legs stretch out over the day and the crotch is too high. Just doesn’t fit crazy well.<br />I’m going to be looking into Lambs now - had high hopes this would fit well.<br />It’s not bad, just not great."
2.0,"All I did was wash them with socks, t-shirts and other underwear.  No metal, velcro or anything abrasive.  When I pulled them out the waistband is already frayed.  So far its only one pair but not sure how long they'll last."
2.0,Could not use the product and is now being returned
2.0,The color is great. I normally wear a xl so I ordered a 2x. Should have ordered 3x at least. Very tight on. Does not hang like in the pic. Seems like it is pretty short too. The sides of the shirt go only to where no the pic they start. I guess I will have to give this to my daughter who wears a med.
2.0,"for me run small, Normally my size is 8-10"
2.0,"Love the look, but I wore it once and the pin part broke beyond repair. At that point it was too late to return."
2.0,Great product horrible delivery
2.0,"Velcro ripped off after 33 days; return window is 31 days. I feel like I’m an anomaly since i haven’t seen anyone else with this issue. But still sucks. It’s a $30 kid’s shoe. Should have lasted at least a few months, i would think. Maybe they were just extra loved, haha!"
2.0,Don’t expect these to keep you warm very thin material
2.0,Everything on the hat is crooked.
2.0,"Sizing appears off, no life to the opal, dull-looking silver.  Disappointed."
2.0,"This is very very very small. I ended up keeping it as an overnight bag for my two-year-old. It's just big enough to fit a couple diapers, wipes and a change of clothes."
2.0,Someone returned the dress and simply put it in another bag. The dress has spots.
2.0,The ends that attach to glasses unfortunately come off easily when adjusting thus making the eyeglass lanyards cords useless.  Don't waste your money
2.0,"The crown of this hat is very floppy and limp.  I don't know if I missed this in the reviews or not.  It LOOKS like a ""pinch-front hat in photos, but it is not at all. Hat has no shape at all. It really looks quite silly on the head. The oil cloth material itself seems ok. Don't know if I will wear it in public or not!"
2.0,Cute colors but it feels like a cheap sheet.
2.0,"The fit was good, fabric comfortable, but when I first put them on, the very first thing that happened when I went to close the button above the fly, it came apart.  And that is the issue -- the product in the display picture is very close too, but certainly NOT the same pants as what I received.  The description shows BUTTONS all around and the descriptions says buttons.  In fact, these pants don't have buttons, they have snap rivets (which normally are more sturdy than buttons and which i personally prefer, but in this case, the one all-important rivet for the fly was made poorly and it just fell apart on just the first try.<br /><br />There are also a few other details that are not correct in the display picture as well.  The pulls on the bottom of the pant legs are not the same; the display picture shows some kind of a tie loop.  That is not there on the pants I got, there was just two pulls that seem to have no practical function at all.  Thing is, I don't really care it they don't match the display picture, but I am just pointing it out in case someone really needs those things.  And of course it's the principle of the thing -- you should get exactly what is shown and described.<br /><br />Oh, and the description says they have an elastic waistband -- FAIL!  they don't no elastic at all and that is a disappointment.  Many ties I don't want to bother putting in a belt and rely on full elastic waistband to hold up my pants.  So this is miss, although not big enough to go thru the hassle of packing them up and getting a refund, but a disappointment nonetheless."
2.0,"I absolutely LOVED this pattern and fit for my short and curvy body. When I first tried it on it looked amazing! That was until I looked in the light. Thank god I didn’t wear this outside. While I love this dress, I think they need to do it in a heavier less see through fabric."
2.0,"nice material but way too long for my liking, going to have to alter the length. good price for a shirt though..... I'm sure i do something with it"
2.0,"These compression socks don't compress.  They feel like regular long socks. I waited to long to return them, so Im stuck with them."
2.0,5 were smashed. 2nd time i order these. and previous one was 5 short.
2.0,It was week
2.0,The dress doesn’t look like the pic. I was expecting cotton and mustard yellow.. instead it’s shiny and GOLD.
2.0,I waited a long time for these and they ripped out of the package. Won't try this brand again.
2.0,I have had great success with a similar product that is also sold on Amazon. I thought I'd try the 40 piece bargain instead of the set with only five finger lasers.  Not only did half of them not light up they don't stay on small fingers as well as the others.
2.0,Nice looking watch but the wrist band keeps opening all the time.
2.0,But material not sufficiently fluffy and fit is too small
2.0,Nice looking hat but many of the stitches between the panels of the cap were loose and hanging when I received it. I had to cut them and melt the ends with a lighter in hopes of keeping the hat from falling apart
2.0,"My wife's wrist measures 5.75"" in circumference, so I ordered her this watch band in size small since it's advertised as being for wrists between 5.0-7.0"".  Unfortunately, it is WAY too big.  She couldn't adjust it tight enough before it ran out of room for further adjustments.  Instead of the small being for wrists between 5-7"", it's more for wrists between 6.5-10.5"" which is even larger than the advertised sizes for the large!  I've attached a picture of the watch band around my wife's lower leg which measured at 10.5"", so readers will know I'm not exaggerating at all.  Sizing issues aside, it is a well made band so I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1."
2.0,"I am so disappointed with these! I opened my package and could not believe how tiny this necklace is. The pearls are very, very small and the necklace does not lay smoothly. Seems to be bent in places.  I sold them to my landlady who bought them for a young female family member.  Saved me a trip to the post office and I did not lose my money.  Amazon...the picture of this item you have on line is NOT it's true appearance. Shame on you."
2.0,Just so everyone knows the picture doesn’t match the product you receive. The picture shows the bands have buckles but the bands you get are the same sport bands everyone else sells. They loop around your wrist and secure with Velcro.
2.0,The shoes were too wide my feet kept slipping through and it sheds.
2.0,"UPDATE: -3 stars. I just got the white one delivered. I ordered the same size as the black (medium) & it’s about 3 inches shorter so there is no way I could wear this with leggings. The tag on the white sweater does indeed indicate it’s a size medium so they didn’t send me the wrong size. While I still love the black sweater, I am very disappointed with the white and will most likely be returning. I have no idea if only the white sweaters are shorter or if they all have inconsistent lengths.<br /><br />ORIGINAL: This was much better quality than I expected! It’s a kind of a thick stretchy material, I was worried it would be thinner. I ordered it in black and I sized up to a medium which was perfect for me for the oversized leggings look. I’m 5’7 and I’d say this hit right at the bare minimum to cover everything for leggings, but with it being stretchy I can also kinda pull it down in the back if I need to. I plan on ordering it in another color!"
2.0,I love this bag I need to say that first. However it is now middle of July and I purchased the bag in early March. The black trim is starting to come off of the handles.  Extremely disappointing because I expect a better level of quality when I'm going to spend money on an item like this and normally I like coach. However now I'm concerned that there may be a quality issue  with coach and I  and that confident that I will buy another coach purse in the future if this is any indication of the quality of their bags now
2.0,tight around neck and too long for a 5'4 girl with Cs. oh well
2.0,"The first shirt I got smelled like chemicals. Replaced it with this current shirt. Worn it for the first time for a few hours  -nothing too physical, the sleeve was torn at the seam. I love the look but it is really cheaply made, may come smelling terrible and will rip. I'd love a replacement but at this point I doubt they will do anything.  Very disappointed..."
2.0,The sleeves are super long and it has this odd football pad look on one of the shoulders. It will not flatten. It's also wide. Definitely not as pictured or flattering. I am returning it.<br /> 
2.0,"The first image is what was pictured, but the second image is what i received. Disappointed as i was looking for &#34;textured&#34; oval earrings."
2.0,"I ordered the black/beige bag... Unfortunately, it only looked black/beige in the Amazon photo. In real life, the bag's stripes were black, beige, blue, green. Incredibly tacky-looking. I immediately packed up for return."
2.0,"This Charis Allure Drawstring Trench Coat is a very strange coat.  I'm not sure I would even call it a coat seeing as it has no structure, no lining and no insulation.  Its basically just a single layer of thin polyester, but unlike most modern polyester garments which usually have a soft hand and smooth texture this one feels like a throwback to the cheap polyester of the 80's and early 90's.  It has a crepe like texture which is itchy, not breathable and just generally looks and feels cheap.  It has hand pockets but they are sewn shut so you can't use them, I really don't understand why clothing makers do this.  I can understand decorative pockets on pants that are meant to be worn tight but to have hand pockets that are sewn shut on a coat just makes no sense.<br /><br />Aside from the material and construction issues, this garment also runs very large and has a shapeless unflattering fit.<br />The only thing I like about this garment is the sleeve length, I am tall and have long arms and often have trouble finding sleeves that are long enough on coats and these sleeves are very long which I like but they would probably be too long for most people with average length arms."
2.0,Did not hold up very long.!
2.0,"I hate to rate this so low, because I may have gotten one that was not so good. It can happen. Others might be fine. But on mine the holes in the belt wore right away and look lousy."
2.0,"Straight from the package the dress was soiled in the armpit area, the tail area of the dress, and the strap join us broken(the area that the straps are attached to). The dress runs large and I was unable to fit it, the shoulders are to large and was falling off me.. I have an event in 5 days and will now have to  recycle one of my old dress because I'm gonna have to return this dress."
2.0,The smell of this dress is aweful.I wasn’t able to wear it all because it smells of a musty odor.I was thinking about washing it first but honestly I’m hesitant.
2.0,This runs very very small. I love the fabric though. So I will remake the waist.
2.0,"This shirt isnt as described or shown at all. Its yellow, and pale bright yellow at that. Its also small"
2.0,Came crumpled with deformed inserts that I can’t seem to reshape no matter how many tutorials I try. It looks like my boobs got in a fender bender. The bra is cute but too thin to wear without the cup inserts.
2.0,"Boots are hard to slip on. Not plush, all man made materials."
2.0,I wear 14 but ordered one size larger but still too small. Good looking boots though.
2.0,"The dress was very tight in the chest, shoulder strap area and was just way too big elsewhere. Can be cute for a bathing suit cover up but overall not very flattering. :/"
2.0,Not as advertised. The logo is off.
2.0,Before I ordered this I was a carabiner guy.  I will continue to order carabiner type key chains. I thought I'd try something new. Bad decision. The hook loop on this is small and I have trouble hooking it to my belt loop when I'm in a hurry.
2.0,I got the largest size. D cup and these were way to small. I loved the feel and how they were made but the sizing was terrible.
2.0,"Socks were far too small for me to use. They are also very thin and are not likely to last long. I would have given a 1 star rating, however, I was able to given them to my spouse with much smaller shoe size. They fit her great."
2.0,"I liked this bag, but the stitching started falling apart after only a couple months of use. Poor quality."
2.0,Cheaper material and really itchy. The size fits good but it’s not too comfortable to wear.
2.0,This is not brass brass doesn’t break me out looks nice but it turned color after one day were and broke out my skin
2.0,"Not crazy about the material. It says it’s 60% Cotton, 40% Polyester but feels more like 100% polyester. Very stiff and scratchy."
2.0,Cute but dark
2.0,This is the first North Face apparel that did not live up to the North Face reputation. The  purported insulation qualities are a sham and do not provide any feeling of warmth retention.
2.0,This is beautiful.  Then it breaks.  So sad.
2.0,"This is a very nice looking bag, also very functional. However, first time out, the hook broke apart, like it was made of plastic. There were two suits, four shirts, and two pairs of shoes in the bag. Absolutely NOT stuffed full. It hung for about an hour, then just fell to the floor with the hook assembly in shattered pieces."
2.0,Had issues. Bought 2 sets to give as gifts for Christmas. One pair was in good condition the other pair had tiny holes in the shirt and strings hanging all over seams. There arnt tags which kinda makes it look janky. And makes it hard to know which is the front. They are nice and stretchy and are comfortable. But I really wouldn’t buy again at the price I paid. Def doesn’t look like the model in the pics. Unless you buy a few sizes larger than usual.
2.0,Guess it would work well if you worked in an environment where you needed to keep glasses snug on your head. Does not really work if you do not put glasses on top of your head
2.0,"Poor quality, not soft like other bamboo socks I own. Don't stay up."
2.0,"Very uncomfortable, I don't even wear them.  They are very narrow and I have small feet.  I wouldn't buy them again."
2.0,They fil ok
2.0,XXL is more like a small.  Order 3X your actual size. No joke.
2.0,"The XXL is closer to U.S. Large. That is the only reason I scored this one star. It's a beautiful skirt, incredibly soft cotton-like feel rather than polyester as the tag says and lightweight. I wish I could wear it, I normally wear an XL and purchased one size up due to other reviews, but it's still too small."
2.0,"The dress is made of shiny, slick material. It is Asian sized. I wear a US 14/16 and the 4X was a little snug, but workable. The biggest issue is that mine came obviously used and returned. Some of the buttons were hanging on by a thread, some were missing altogether. The stitching around the button holes was unraveling and part of the hem was hanging. It is too close to the event I need it for to order a different dress so I'll just try to fix this one up and make it work. It's just disappointing. Definitely not worth what I paid for it."
2.0,Cheaply made. I do not see any extra capacity
2.0,"I returned this watch within 24 hours.  The face was black and not the Blue-face I ordered.  The other bigger problem was that the clasp for the metal band did not close fully, and the watch fell off my wrist 3 times in 2 hours.<br />To be fair it felt good otherwise and had a time second-hand movement.  I switched to a leather-band with a real buckle clasp instead, and of-course a blue-face."
2.0,The earring itself is very nice but the screw back is way too small to handle.  They came with the white slide on earring backs and I think that's what I'll be using because I'm sure I'll lose the screw back.  First time I put them on I dropped the backs several times. Luckily I found them but I don't think I'll be so lucky for long. I bought these earring specifically for the screw back but I'm very disappointed.
2.0,This item does not look at all like in the picture. Cheap thin material and looks more like a shirt than a dress. Do not get it. This is what you can expect from China. Never again.
2.0,I had to return these because the size did not fit as expected.
2.0,"I tried it on, loved it, washed it and now so small I can’t even zip"
2.0,Returned. Too small
2.0,"Soft padded - come out and fabric come off during the first washing.  (gentle cycle),"
2.0,"Fabric is super soft which is nice, however the elastic waistband in the shorts is a joke. Worn ONE time to sleep in. Woke up and the elastic is all twisted - can’t untwist it no matter what you do. Tried to sleep in them again but it’s just too uncomfortable with the elastic mess. Shorts got tossed but kept the shirt."
2.0,"Good material, run small."
2.0,"The fabric is very cheap.  It's the wrong size.  It may have been my fault, but I can't wear this.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.  I guess you DO get what you pay for - but when I get a $9 dress at Zulilly.com it's good quality.  Go figure.  Sorry Amazon, you just don't live up to the picture."
2.0,"I really liked the look of this watch and it kept great time, but the crown fell out and wont work at all now. Rather then try the warranty system I just threw it away. Doesn't feel worth the time."
2.0,"Cheaper alternative to Nike’s expensive padded sports bras. Ultimately not worth the purchase. Cheaply made. Padding falls apart in the wash and once the outer layer peels off, the pads are IMpossible to put back in place. I’m now stuck with 6 bras (ordered two 3packs) and only about 9 good padding pieces and I predict that number will continue to quickly dwindle until I have zero."
2.0,It looks like a fake silk nurse's scrub top.
2.0,It was not what I thought it would be. I had to alter it for sure to fit me but I will say. I will keep it because I like the idea but I wish it came with instructions on how to attach the straps. I really enjoy the look of it when you get it the way it should be or the way I wanted it to look.
2.0,"It's a good skirt for the money but the white is a weird bluish white. I might order a color next time. Nice and long. I am 5' 9"" so short girls beware!"
2.0,This is not what it feels like when I had one from the Navy when I was in it. It was so much better when I would touch it or rub my hand over it. I would like a refund please.
2.0,The clasp broke after a week of wear. I was really disappointed.
2.0,"This product did not look like the picture at all. The wire in the front bunches up at my hip and causes a Lump appearance, and I have a long torso! The fabric looks cheap, the bunny tail in the back is too high, and it fits too loosely on my boob area-I am a size Small and have 32 Cs and it's still too big!"
2.0,To small I ordered an extra large
2.0,These pants are not the ones pictured.  The pockets are much smaller.  They are also not really slim fit.
2.0,"The shirt did not exactly fit like the picture. It was loose fitting. Also, the material appears more silky and thicker than it really is. It feels more like a very thin cotton blend. I would order a size down."
2.0,Fits fine but the clasps for the suspender part are so cheap that they broke right away and were impossible to figure out.  We had to pin them so my daughter could wear them.
2.0,It is a very gorgeous ring and wish I didn't have to send it back but already lost 2 stones of first getting it.  Unfortunately it's a cheaply made ring if the stones are already falling out within less then an hour of wearing the ring especially for the price they are charging.
2.0,Looks and feels nice but keeps falling apart
2.0,The item was too large for the size.
2.0,"For one, I didn't expect it to come in a little baggie... Maybe I thought it would be all nice and organized like it is in the picture? I'm not sure but what I got definitely wasn't it. I didn't like having to pour all the rings out just to find one I wanted and when I did, the balls kept falling off. Two rings are now without balls and I guess there's no returning it now. Aside from that, I can say that do like the quality of the metal. Overall, I wish I hadn't spent money on this. Bad purchase for me."
2.0,Didn't fit wt all inmy usual size. Fabric was strange. It smelled odd.
2.0,"I have been wanting to try something like this for awhile to balance my shape. Im blessed up top but not so much on the bottom... its kinda flat. I wasnt blown away by the difference it made, but at least it didnt look over exaggerated n fake. Very very subtle difference. I didnt use the hip pads bc they made me look lumpy not hippy. They run EXTREMELY SMALL. Im normally a xl to 1x in bottoms but due to reviews i ordered the 3x. They fit perfectly so def size up 1 or even 2 sizes. Im not sure if you are supposed to but i prefer to wear them on top of normal underwear n unless you are going to be in the A/C I don't recommend wearing them for long in the summer. They are very hot n the material made me sweat more. They didnt stay in place on the legs they rolled n rode up which was very uncomfortable (my thighs are a bit thick..not sure if they'd do that on smaller thighs) Im going to keep them bc i will most likely wear them again but next time i think ill try the ones that aren't shorts with a bit more padding. My husband said that he could see a difference so that was a plus."
2.0,"I love the color, design, and comfort of the shirt, but very disappointed that it arrived with a hole in it."
2.0,Poor quality does not play right when put on
2.0,Doesn't for like the pic. The neck part is sewn on really weirded. Not a fan at all.
2.0,"These ride, need a built in sports bra or they will slide on you"
2.0,I thought it would was 10 x 10 photo.  It was life size.  Not what I wanted but worth it for laugh’s.  Their grandma loved it.
2.0,Overall it's a really cute idea however the picture is quite deceiving. The picture above is slightly smaller than the actual ring and yet you can definitely tell what stone you are looking at. You can hardly see the stone. The stone appears to be vibrant and protrude out a little in the picture so it can be seen. The surgical steel border is much wider than it is in the picture and covers most of the stone... Which you can't even tell what stone might be in there... Without a flashlight and magnifying glass. I'm hoping that this was a flawed piece and the second one that I ordered will look way better or they're both going back.
2.0,The jacket is super cute but the smell is terrible. I mean it made me gag smelling it. I've washed it 3 times and the smell is still there. Would recommend buying this product unless you can get the smell out.
2.0,Thought it would be cozy and warm but the material is super thin. You can feel a breeze with it on so I wouldn’t recommend this product unless you do a lot of layers underneath.
2.0,"I loved the overall look and feel of them, but they kept rolling down and were not very functional."
2.0,"The pic itself on the pins were beautiful, but the actual pin on the back to pin into your clothing is way to thick causing permanent holes."
2.0,Very dull looking
2.0,"The hat is made well enough. The color pictured for carbon gray is accurate except for the stitching around the round holes, which is white. The hat adjusts with Velcro-style tape in back. The rough side is white and the soft side is a white tape with brown fuzz. Looks odd.<br /><br />I bought this hat because it is all cotton and was willing to pay a slight premium price for the fabric. It is very clearly advertised as made in USA. The tag clearly states made in China."
2.0,material is very thin
2.0,"I tried to make this review,, not sure if they deleted the first one, but basically this bag unfortunately has inexcusable cosmetic errors to the front and stitching throughout. I think it could even be a fake, the tag is from 2022 and looks different from the 2021 release. Would return it, but frankly I don’t want to, and I’m afraid the replacement they send might be worse, so capitalism wins this time. I love yellow submarine so I’ll take this chance to have a loungefly I can wear more casually, ya know due to the lack of quality."
2.0,Looked cheap.  And it was too small
2.0,"I loved it, but it was too see through. The tie dye was nice."
2.0,Not suited for cold weather. Soles made of a hard material. Very slippery on ice.  Returning them.
2.0,"They are light on the face and the design is sleek and flattering, but the quality is just not there.  The bridge broke just under normal use while sitting at my desk at work. Notice in the pic also how the colored film is coming off the sides. These are probably not healthy to have on your head."
2.0,Very cheap material train balls up due to it being a little too long. Made of spandex material that will show everything. The other material is comfy you can tell that this cut in sizing of this are meant for someone who is a bit bigger. I would recommend anyone who is the petite size to look elsewhere.
2.0,"Too Small.  Bought to replace lost earring backs.  I've yet to find a pair of earrings they fit, even my tiniest studs."
2.0,It’s cute but rusts very quick and easy.
2.0,"The shirt does not look blue, it's very dark and the material of shirt is kind of tough. I really wish I would of been satisfied because the image online is very nice. Unofficially returning shirt"
2.0,"On sight, it's a pretty dress. Thin fabric, as was expected. I ordered based on the sellers measurement guide and although it does fit, it's not comfortable. I have a large chest and the top doesn't quite fit correctly. All I know is, if a woman buying a 2xl has boobs that sit that high, I am jealous!! A minimizer bra helps. I had to sew 3 buttons back on before trying it on, so not the best quality."
2.0,broke after two uses  right down the center
2.0,"This is a really pretty necklace, but unfortunately, the chain was all bent and twisted. I tried to straighten it out, but the type of chain it is doesn't bend very well. It's the thicker type that, once bent, won't straighten out.<br /><br />Overall, it's a cute statement piece, but you're definitely getting what you pay for here. Based on the condition of the necklace I received, I would not recommend this."
2.0,I read the reviews about the sizing so I went up a size.  This sweater fits like a medium or small and I ordered an XL.
2.0,"You have to really push the on/off button to turn it off and something it doesn’t even turn off at all, the volume buttons are even worst 🙂😓😤"
2.0,Way smaller. I ordered a 2x so it would be good and loose and since reviews say runs small. But it was way small. 2x is at best a small large. Really hated it didn't fit.
2.0,It’s way to thin and see through
2.0,Not a true size 43 or what should be 11 in US sizing. They are about a full size too small in comparison. Please keep this in mind when purchasing.
2.0,"This pajama fits to size. The tank top is very sheer however. Not decent to wear in front of others whether you're wearing a bra or not. The quality of the fabric is very poor and looks like it won't last through multiple washes. On the other hand, the bottom is made of thicker fabric but is very uncomfortable to sleep in. It's thick and way too baggy, completely unattractive. Poor quality top and an baggy unattractive bottom."
2.0,Cute but sized way too small
2.0,It’s poor quality . We are reserving this for summer but I believe after few washes this will be unwearable .
2.0,I can see how useful this is but it came damaged during shipping wish it was more protected for shipping. But if it was not bent and scratched it would have great.
2.0,"This watch face is too big--might be popular these days, but I don't like it."
2.0,It didn't stay up-
2.0,Footbed was supportive. Straps were stiff rubber/plastic and had already started to degrade. I returned this product.
2.0,"I like that they feel lightweight? However, the sizing is out of whack and they feel cheap for the price I paid, even for it being on sale. I bought an XS. I'm a relatively built and short guy, and I received no support or ""compression"" from these tank tops whatsoever. It was still baggy and ill-fitted. They're paper-thin even without having to stretch much. I definitely wouldn't recommend these, especially if you're on the smaller side, or have remotely mild gynecomastia, or are transgender. I can't imagine fabric this thin doing anybody wonders, to be honest, even for someone taller and larger than me, etc."
2.0,I buy it!🤒🤒🤒maximum time I get worst😞😞one of these.i thought it’s gonna good but it’s too loose.
2.0,"Purple?<br />Hah.<br />The description says purple, the package, when received says purple, but the watchband is NOT purple. Not even pale lavender. It's pale grey."
2.0,"I bought for my girlfriend and it is not nearly as long as it appears in the picture.  As a result, the side slits go up way too high"
2.0,"It was a beautiful dress and I'd have happily kept it, but it just didn't work on me.  it wasn't too big or too small, just didn't look right on me and my shape. it seemed well made, and I hated to send it back. Too bad. Give it a try, though."
2.0,"Arrived quickly but found material to not be soft and felt rather ""cheap"".  Very disappointed as I wear alot of these and I am always looking for more. Returned and actually found one less expensive and better quality at TJ Maxx. Don't be fooled by the nice colors if you are looking for a soft and comfy sweater there are better options out there."
2.0,Comfortable  - too big
2.0,Ordered this bathing suit because of the longitude name. Definitely not a longitude size I always wear way too small
2.0,They weren’t all mirrored
2.0,Size charge is completely off. Don’t waste your money if you have a belly. Not true to size. Would have been very cute though
2.0,"I wasn't thrilled with this purse. Actually, I guess it is the color that I didn't like. The purse in the picture looks burgundy to me, but in person is was pretty red and I don't do red. I was really bummed. the other thing that surprised me is the purse is HUGE!!! I couldn't believe how big it was. So, if you like ginormous and red this purse is for you. I really did like the style and feel, but I just wasn't willing to settle with a red purse. i just couldn't do it."
2.0,The top was wayyy to small and I ordered up a size. It was very tight around the arms and hit and my belly button.
2.0,"Very pretty and soft but runs very small. I ordered an XL I'm 5'5"" 150 pounds and it just comes together in front"
2.0,"It was bent when packaged and doesn’t seem like it will go away since the material is now wrinkled in that spot. I will try to lay it flat and see what happens. It is however very comfortable, but the bend looks awkward when you put it on."
2.0,"I would not recommend this to anyone, and I won't buy it again because of the smell, even though the price is good and it's comfort. The first two days were really bad. After washed, soaked, and exposed outside for two days, I can bring it in. After a week, the smell is still there when the shoes are 2 feet away."
2.0,"Bracelet is perfect size to wear all day!  Box n added information a treat and makes it all a great value!!! - Those words were my original review and I still feel the same except you CAN""T wear it everyday since the thread on mine already broke!  Luckily I was able to get all the beads so will have to restring -"
2.0,"Las medidas están correctas, es muy bonito, pero la tela es muy fina. La tela no me gusto, no tiene mucha calidad, fina y transaparente."
2.0,"When the item arrived, I was delighted and would finally be able to stop shivering my entire morning. After not even a full day of light use, I noticed that a pocket zipper didn't even work properly. When I tried to hang it up, the hood zipper would give out and just fall to the floor. I really can't hang it up on anything. The water resistance is 'okay' at best. The water smears around, gets in zippers and got my phone wet. The coat's nice and fuzzy inside stops at the sleeves and continues down the sleeve with an uncomfortable feeling liner like on the outside of the coat."
2.0,Ordered Olive green color hat and the color I received was brown. I returned it.
2.0,Fits like a small in the chest. The seam is rigid and has no give.
2.0,It's not as shown in photo
2.0,These weren't so great...blahhh
2.0,The socks were so tight they hurt my legs
2.0,"These are very cute pajamas, with pretty feminine accents like lace, bows and embroidery. I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they were waaaay too small for her. She is plus size and I wear small/medium and they almost fit me! Sizing is way off. So if you are a small, order a large."
2.0,"too long for a petite size,  tight on my waist"
2.0,Seems like good quality but didn't fit the thick screw-on posts of my  22k indian gold earrings. So actually doesn't fit EVERY screw on post - and kind of useless for me.
2.0,I ordered 3 sizes up & it was still too small
2.0,This watch band will only last 2 years max. The strap holder on this band will last about a year and then roughly a year later the whole band will break. The price seems too steep for a band that won't last
2.0,"Not very flattering, it's made of a shiny material that looks cheap."
2.0,"Didn't get to choose my color of beads as I understood you would get to at check out. Bracelets are made well, but color choices were ugly. Please make an option for people to choose their colors!"
2.0,My daughter loves this bag but it cannot hold her books . The strap broke and I exchanged it and it broke again. Now I can’t return it and she can’t use it.
2.0,It is see through and the color is not accurate.
2.0,es demaciado grande la tela me gusta
2.0,"Going back.  That tie in the back is just weird and I don't see that it has any function.  The elastic in the waist is not flattering to me.  I thought it was going to be longer on me.  I can say the color was nice, though."
2.0,I returned this item. The material resembled polyester and I did not like it.
2.0,"This the first Wacoal bra that I don't like. It has an awkward fit (and I bought my usual size, 34D). It also has such a &#34;severe&#34; look. I don't like this style at all."
2.0,The top of this dress is cute with the off-the -shoulder design.  But the bottom looks ridiculous.  It has tiered ruffles and is too short.
2.0,These are comfortable but I did not like the colors.
2.0,"Nice case, did not realise there would be no screen protection if you lay the phone face down."
2.0,It was a Halloween costume of Evie in Descendants.  It was not worth the costume because it was not the real costume.  It was a photo printed onto fabric.  Don't buy this.  It's not worth the 45-50 dollars.
2.0,"If all my fingers were the size of my pinky..my hand would look like the photo..unfortunately I have life size Adult hands, and cant get but 2 on--BOTH on my pinky and turned my finger green by the end of the day. Give them to the kids."
2.0,Weird dress.... I don't know what else to say. Its funky.
2.0,I wanted to love it but so much material it seems to add volume...
2.0,"Fits good but the pants are way too long, I’m 5’2 these pants are for tall girls"
2.0,Cute jacket. The xxlarge is like a US medium.  Still trying to figure out how to get the wrinkles out. Tried to tumble dry it and the wrinkles did not come. Not sure if I'll keep it.
2.0,"I purchased the Grey in size Medium. Approximate measurements laying flat unstretched: chest underarm to underarm 18"", length shoulder to longest hem 26"", length shoulder to bottom of side seam 22"", across hem at widest section before the curve 19.5"". As a loose fit style top, this runs small. I wear a Medium in relaxed fit basic tops, 36C bra, and if I wanted it to fit loose like the picture then I would need at least a Large, possibly XL. The issue I had was with the sleeves. In the picture they look like the same fabric has the body but different colors in heather. The actual fabric is almost like swimsuit or gym material and not heather, it's some kind of weird pattern. I've added pictures. Overall I wasn't particularly impressed, even for the cheap price, and it certainly wasn't what I expected."
2.0,"This gets the job done if you need accessories for your costume but for me, my face itched so bad with the lace. I had to return it."
2.0,These are ok. After 3 uses the rubber started to peel off the glove. Had to buy new ones *I bought elsewhere from a different seller*.
2.0,terrible quality . I could save the money for being so cheap and purchasing such a cheap blouse
2.0,"Quite disappointing! It tarnished a lot in a very short time! Right away, I was put off by the look of the pendant, which is glued in from one side, with an empty hole on the other. It looks pretty, but only from a distance."
2.0,"A low quality product. Barely fits my Apple Watch, have to try to put it on for 5 mins every time."
2.0,"Although this shirt is cut like a Tshirt it is definitely not the fabric I expected,  this is more of a nylon fabric like what yoga spandex pants feel like.  Not crazy about it.."
2.0,I am an XL so I ordered an XL.  It did not fit. I passed it to my 11 yr old daughter that wears a Large in girl size. I ain't going to lie it was a cute shirt.
2.0,"Way too tight, gave me headaches if I was wearing too long.  Gave it to my 7 yo son and he loves it, fits him perfectly"
2.0,"Bought this for my son and he loved it.  But in a few months, the wristband became worn and before we replaced it, it fell off his arm and broke into many pieces.  He was heartbroken.  May be ok for just an occasional wearer but you do have to re-set the time often.  I will not order this brand again."
2.0,Picture was upside down.  Also it was hard to see.  Very cheaply made.
2.0,Disappointed.. I am not sure if i will give her
2.0,"I usually wear a large. Even the XL was tight. I'm 5'2"" and the pants are too long for someone my height.  The material feels good though, don't know how long it would last and what it would look like after washing, as I'm returning it"
2.0,"Very cheap quality, see through and arrived with a hole!!!!"
2.0,Pants ran small and are hand wash or dry clean only.
2.0,weird material and a little washed out looking but it will do
2.0,The hat looks fine - it claims to be environmentally friendly being from recycled materials on attached boiler plate leaflet - Then is says on the actual hat labels that I cannot be washed and cleaned.<br /><br />This hat is simple not fit for purpose - hashing clothes is basic expectation.<br /><br />The only reason I got this hat was expectation of quality from North Face versus generic $10 hats - That was a mistake I will not repeat.
2.0,"Very comfortable joggers, colors are as expected. I enjoyed the fit and comfort of these pants, but they lasted about 5 wears before they started tearing at the seams. Really sad, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Look cool and pretty.<br />Super heavy!! They WILL fall of your face if you look down. Constantly readjusting them to stay on your face, super annoying."
2.0,the fabric is not a flannel type fabric it is a cheap replica the inside is white and the outside has the printed pattern on it.<br />the fit is as expected and fabric is soft.<br />I guess for the money... :(
2.0,I just got my tops and they are not compression tops.  They fit like a comfortable loose fit workout top. compression shirts should be tight all around. these definitely are not and i ordered according to the size chart.  The material is the same as other work out tops I have.
2.0,"My package came early but it didn’t have all of the pieces on one and the other broke instantly, I am very disappointed with this package and we are going to return it."
2.0,"Terrible fit and fabric, way too short and sleeves are unproportional"
2.0,This shoe is a bit 'snugger' than I thought it would be and the back straps won't stay up on my heels like they should.
2.0,Make sure you order two sizes bigger they run really small.
2.0,Cannot read watch ver well. Built in light very weak. Overall unhappy with purchase. Would not recommend purchasing this watch. Disappointed with purchase.
2.0,the band on this watch broke only after 3 weeks.
2.0,"I bought the black zippered front one, its totally see through and super thin! And will need to be ironed everytime it is washed. I will be returning it."
2.0,"Works, but I like my slide belt much better. The buckel is bulky and the release is awkward, I will not buy again."
2.0,My daughter loved product until they turned in food and made her ears green
2.0,My brother picked these masks himself and loved them (they fit him nicely) but after one wash they shrunk and now fit him tight. Disappointed.
2.0,"I found these to be rough around the band edges. The elastic is not wrapped and irritating to the skin. Great price, very pretty, and almost perfect fit."
2.0,Not for me. The hinges grab my hair and the bevel edges create odd light reflections. Got a good case and small screwdriver out of it!
2.0,A little small and what is up with the flap of fabric inside the dress on the chest area?! It looks so horrible and shows through the dress.
2.0,"Although I have skinny ankles and wear a ladies size 9 shoe, the size M socks were much too tight around my ankles to be comfortable. Will be returning them to get a larger size."
2.0,Unfortunately... this was much too bulky for me.  I was looking for something to use as a concealed carry.  I still plan to use with my range bag... but... it's just not what I hoped for.
2.0,"The seller was prompt in sending the product, but the glasses are not the way they appear. The bottom of the frame resembles a heart, but the top part is almost a straight line, unlike heart shaped."
2.0,Top and bottom were two different sizes. Wrong color rec'd.
2.0,"I really wanted this suit to work.  Extremely short torso.  I decided to get an xl after returning the l and there was no, I mean no, difference in the size.  What a waste of time."
2.0,"Very uncomfortable after a full work day on my feet. The woven design ends up leaving patterned indents in my skin. I’m not particularly old or overweight. I wanted to wear compression socks to prevent varicose veins, but I find these unwearable for work"
2.0,Hold everything in but only because it squishes my boobs and makes me look like I have none
2.0,I'm so upset these run small.
2.0,"I bought these glasses because they are extremely compact -- they fold up into a flat plastic case and, in that respect, are convenient for travel, and for situations like boating where you don't want to risk losing a $200 pair of Ray-Bans. The lens clarity is OK, but not what I'd expect in a $70 pair of sunglasses. What really annoys me about these glasses is that, when the sun is at certain oblique angles, the sunlight reflects on the inside of the lenses. I've noticed this with some, but not all, inexpensive sunglasses (it won't happen with high-end glasses but that's not the comparison here). All in all, they're OK but I'd rather find a cheaper pair of glasses that doesn't reflect on the inside, or take a chance with my bulky & expensive Ray-Bans!"
2.0,Wore it and noticed anything or anyone I touch black stuff was coming off from the shirt
2.0,I love SoJos. I have purchased few pair and I highly recommend my friends and family to purchase this sunglasses. The reason for two stars is because this pair came in a bit defective. One of the legs was very lose.
2.0,"I thought these would be alot better for $40. They don't change color and lenses cant be turned.. The strap doesn't really adjust, it's kind of stuck in place and the band feels like it's fragile. I don't want to pull or adjust it and have it snap.<br />The plastic nose piece in between the lenses looks like it could break easily too, and then your goggles are useless.<br />Says on a tag to read cautions before use, but didn't arrive with any.<br />I feel the case could be better quality too, it's just a thin soft material.<br />Overall honestly, I am bummed with this purchase and wish I hadn't."
2.0,Request for picture
2.0,"I bought this in white so maybe it’s the color but the sleeves look weird to me. They look like they don’t belong, like an afterthought"
2.0,"Was disappointed when I opened this package.  Lots of stuff that I’ve known right away.  Lots of the beads were loose and not sewn on properly, breast padding is attached by a single thread, back does not have any security, and it’s time consuming because you have to tie it, it will take another person to assist with this dress.  Yes it’s pretty design but overall quality it is poorly made."
2.0,"I wear an 11 USA...ordered 43 which is the largest.  Toes were at the end of the shoe.  So disappointed...they were so cute.  Had to send them back.  I f you are going to order, I would go 2 sizes up."
2.0,does not fit as shown. I will be returning this one.
2.0,"These look fantastic and fit my face perfectly. But as sunglasses they are sub-par. I find myself squinting when I am wearing them because they do not provide enough protection. I do not squint with another pair I bought off of Amazon.<br /><br />Also, the lens color has already rubbed off in one area with just normal use."
2.0,This would have been a great jersey but the fit isn't as stated. This runs smaller. Unfortunately thst is the risk of buying online and not being able to try it before buying.
2.0,Super cute but seem big. They don't fit my 8 month old. I thought it was going to be soft rubber sides of frame. And it's not. They are hard plastic. Kept hoping they will fit soon
2.0,Out of all of these their were only 2 that I wore. I also wore this other one but the chain broke right as I tried putting it on..
2.0,"Fall off your feet. Don't stay on the bottom of your feet and I wear a size 9 shoe, medium width."
2.0,They broke 2 days after I had them. The pin came out on the lens making them useless. I don't recommend buying these.
2.0,Don't fir on face correctly
2.0,This was obviously tried on and worn out and about. This would take sitting in a wooden bench or grip on a skateboard to create this amount of pill in one evening!  I don’t know about the fit because I can’t bring myself to try it on!
2.0,I wish they had fit they were so comfortable!!
2.0,One pair had holes after first time wearing them
2.0,"I got a 5X (I'm normally a 2X) after checking the measurements in the chart. It's way too small, which is a shame, because it's gorgeous. Shipped quickly and in perfect condition. I may try untying the back strings completely and trying it on that way."
2.0,I ordered the 9-12 months and it was definitely for a 18-24 month old.
2.0,"Mine didnt come with a strap, but other then that, its just as pictured, and pretty big in size. Daughter loves it."
2.0,LACE DOESN'T LAY FLAT. Such a cute shirt but the lace is not sewn down everywhere and it makes it look like someone just happend to sew on some lace and did a poor job.
2.0,I like the material but its too small.
2.0,"This is such poor quality for a ridiculous price. I know you can get these much cheaper at the big box stores and while cheaper isn't always better, in this case the cheaper ones at the big box stores are a million times better in quality. I ordered the panda set for my daughter's birthday and have had to return it twice. The first time the puffy ear fell off and the second time, the seam split just below the belly in the crotch area. Super disappointing since my daughter loved the design and style and wanted to keep them. Such a pain! The feel of the material is also very thin- it feels like it could easily get a hole in it just from washing a few times."
2.0,Okay so I'm dropping to two stars from five because after wearing it a total of 10 times the band looks extremely worn and loose and the battery is going out already.
2.0,The quality was not what I had hoped for.
2.0,"Poor material, fitting to big and sequins were missing"
2.0,The fit is too loose and the Velcro is at the very edge it could possibly be. Very uncomfortable to walk on because it's very hard under your feet.
2.0,The package was very good when I received this item in my mail box.<br />Had a nice gift box with nice greeting card and it was light pink box very impressive!.<br /><br />But it broken in just 2 uses<br /><br />This chain is pinkish and very thin.
2.0,There is a large red rim behind the sunglasses that I didn't see.
2.0,"This dress was overall a good fabric and relatively true to size. However, it was cut super weird in the arms, like the holes were not large enough. I am very well endowed so this may play a part. It was actually painful how it cut, so unfortunately it had to be returned. So sad because it was adorable."
2.0,Super bummed I was looking forward to this dress arriving!  It came and has a color bleach like stain on it!
2.0,Pretty but wished it was shinier. It is dull in color compared to other silver jewelry. It has more of a nickel finish.
2.0,It's the equivalent of a flex fit small. Beautiful quality though.
2.0,I thought there were a pair instead of a single strap.
2.0,It was soft but didn't fit well at all it was a total crop
2.0,"I was torn about this romper because of the length, so I went through practically all reviews to decide. Buyers who wore similar sizes to me didn't have issues with the length, so I decided to give it a try. I can normally fit small or medium, so I got a large to be on the safe side.<br /><br />Large fit great, but I didn't feel comfortable moving around in the romper. The romper was either going to ride up or fall down."
2.0,Not that gray really. Mostly the buckle feels flimsy. It’s also difficult to get through belt loops because of the buckle shape. It says inch and a half wide but its not especially when stretched out. Definitely not worth $30 more like$15
2.0,"This was t-shirt material and not thick at all. too flimsy to wear to the office, which is what I was hoping for. Returned it."
2.0,I threw this unit away. It was hard to coil and uncoil. The bag was too small with very long handles. This deserves one star but I like the idea of easy storage and hope they improve the design.
2.0,"Exactly as described. Pros same print and style seen at online boutiques. Cons definitely not a high end shirt as cut is awkward and seams are not even overall. Very much usable though, just not something that will last for years to come"
2.0,The sleeves are to small to get my arms into it. I ordered the larges size but it does fit.
2.0,Nice Shoes....but why do you sell product that is not size accurate?  Unfortunately if you wear a 14 and it runs atleast 1 size small I have NO options!
2.0,"Based on other reviews,  I got an XXL. Which was a tad too small. The reason I'm returning it is the neck and collar hang weird."
2.0,Too small that says it all.
2.0,Hardly any feathers and too small in the shoulders.  Would not buy again due to the lack of feathers.
2.0,"Very very dainty... thin but, 925 sterling however, its a Christmas gift for an 19 year old who does where jewelry.  Its very simple, plan but very thin."
2.0,"You get what you pay for with these belyd. The design is great, but not quality materials."
2.0,one of the lens wobble and the sun hits on your eye... no good!
2.0,The clasp finding broke
2.0,cheap in style
2.0,Suze runs very small at the waist.
2.0,"bigger than it looks, does not look or feel like leather and smelled awful. I sent it back"
2.0,"Doesn't look at all like the pictures. The pale peach pink shown is a much deeper rosy pink. The texture doesn't resemble at all the photos. And although I ordered a Medium, it fits like an XXL. Would not recommend"
2.0,"Ordered 50pc<br />Out of 10 I opened so far,<br />4 has scratches.<br />Some the cover won’t snap in because<br />The size doesn’t fit."
2.0,It's pretty but runs large. No shape at all.
2.0,"I don't like the way this dress hangs, maybe because it was a little eon the large side. I got a medium and really needed a small."
2.0,"I'm a size 2x I bought a 3x because most of the reviews said they product ran kinda small, boy who are they telling. Normally I could slide right into a 3x but this one was either the wrong size or just made wrong."
2.0,Look very cheap not impress
2.0,"Tela muy ordinaria, terminados y costuras mal elaboradas"
2.0,The pattern is flattering however zipper is in the back and very difficult to zip.. suggest making zipper on the side.
2.0,"Run small, touch for my phone does not work!"
2.0,"These are very nice socks. But they are not 100% cotton. They have something stretchy that makes the top bind  and throughout the sock I believe. I'm 70 yr. old women and have worn cotton socks my entire life. Real cotton socks will bag out a little and leave no marks on legs because they are cotton and are harder to put on, There is no elastic in sock that is 100% cotton. Years ago a few stores carried them now difficult to find. So beware, These shrink quit a bit and they make marks on legs and the top I'm sure has some kind of elastic in it. Legally, they need to say how much of whatever makes it keep its shape and be stretchy on top and/or throughout the sock. Since its false advertising, even tho' I washed them I should be able to return at sellers expense and get my money back. my guess is they have 1-3 % other (elastic/spandex/whatever) After washed in cold water and dried, they are too small and I bought largest possible . I take a 9 1/2 shoe. Do not buy if you want really a  true 100% cotton."
2.0,They  are smaller than the ones i ordered before and are tighter
2.0,I am returning the nightgown because it was not the quality I expect. Design of nightgown is good.
2.0,Winter Gloves? NOT! These are thin fabric gloves like any other rubberized work gloves. They do not provide any insulation from cold weather.  The rubberized coating is so thick the gloves are stiff and almost useless.  Would not recommend.  Very disappointed.
2.0,I pulled it out of the pack and was shocked at how tiny it was.. The size isn't for adults I guess.. Strap and watch face looks damn small.. Well I'll manage
2.0,Cute top. Bottoms are see through. 😕 Sent it back. Bummer.
2.0,Might be slouchy on a midget or child or adult missing majority of skull.
2.0,It’s pretty but item arrived w the stone detached on one of the earrings.
2.0,"Product came in on time. However, it does not look like the picture portrayed in the advertisement.  It’s smaller and quick to turn into a brass color instead of the original color of gold."
2.0,No difference between front or back except for the draw strings. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2.0,This watch was a disappointment.  The 2nd hand kept sticking.  It also came with no instructions on how to change the links.<br />Being returned
2.0,"these earrings are gorgeous. unfortunately I have no idea what to do with them. I the part you put through your ear is so very delicate and thin its scary, don't talk on the phone with these on you'll break that peg. the hole you are trying to put the peg into is also very tiny I haven't managed to get it right so I haven't worn them, you'll either have to be very good, lucky or have help putting them on. absolutely beautiful but not real practical. too bad i love the feel of them. I also can see them scratching behind your ear if you get them on the beg is very sharp!"
2.0,Runs small and has no stretch
2.0,Poor quality. Broke within a month.
2.0,Shirt wrinkles. My daughter complains that the outfit is uncomfortable and won’t wear it.
2.0,"Very tacky, not at all as pictured, and WAY bigger than expected."
2.0,These sandals had obviously been worn before. They had sweat residue and the stickers were damaged. I cleaned them up but they still turned out too small.
2.0,"I eventually found the picture in the bracelet, but it took about 45 minutes to do so! It’s cute though."
2.0,This rayon dress is going to be wrinkled all day!  It's very thin fabric.  Not going to work.  Sad.
2.0,"The company should probably write in the description that this bag comes with a tag on it that reads “this product may contain lead a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.” That was a wonderful surprise when I opened up the package to see this label when I was going to gift it to my mom, a breast cancer survivor. I would have never bought this had I known this information prior. I’m really disappointed. The bag is just what I was looking for to give as a gift, but I’m now returning it. It’s unfortunate."
2.0,I thought the stainless steel posts would help my daughter's ears with their sensitivity to metal but they did not. The clarify and variety of sizes was very nice though.
2.0,"The strap itself is great, soft and good quality. The buckle however is garbage. I almost lost my watch today at work and I’ve had this thing for exactly 7 days."
2.0,Definitely not true to size. Order a bigger size
2.0,Horrible horrible panties. They were made for I don't know who but not for women. They are not breathable at all! Returned it.
2.0,Looks cheap. Didn’t come with tags. Stitching not very good.
2.0,Wanted to like it but it just never fit right. The tie in the back was weird and even ordered 2 different sizes.
2.0,"A very very beautiful and very stunning and comfortable belly ring. I loved and it looked great. BUT after about 3 months of having it, it started rusting and turning my belly/skin green from it being cheap. If it was better quality and didn’t rust/make skin green it would be the perfect belly ring."
2.0,just was an odd fit
2.0,I would not try this shirt unless you are tall and skinny.
2.0,"This shirt was ok, I didn't like the material and the arms looked funny. I would size down as well."
2.0,Terrible quality. Hardly any elastic. Lots of stray strings that catch as you are trying to put them on!
2.0,Very thin and tight.
2.0,"Read reviews and many said the fit was good. If you have any curves this is not for you. Originally ordered large, I take caution because of my booty. Couldn’t even get the costume over my bottom. Then ordered the xxl thinking since it’s being sold as unisex it would definitely fit. It’s still very tight around my booty. It works, kinda squishing in them, just wish the sizing and measurements would make sense for customers. Quality of costume is good. Just be aware of the slim fit to the costume."
2.0,There was a plastic powder/residue where the bar and ends screw together. They were a little on the flimsy side and you have to screw them together gently or you will strip them out right away. Wouldn't recommend this product. You're probably better off going to a local piercer or tattoo shop.
2.0,not form fitting as shown
2.0,"The product did not came as expected, in the description it is stated that it comes with the box. hoever mine came in a plastic bag..."
2.0,Not best quality or fit
2.0,The socks don't stay up.
2.0,Very cheaply made and too big.
2.0,"For the price, this product does not offer the compression strength if you are purchasing for medical reasons."
2.0,I mean you definitely get what you pay for. But they aren't the worst things on the planet.
2.0,"Very cute! Looks just like the picture, but runs small / short."
2.0,The black beads are kind a large....so it is a little disappointing and very uncomfortable.....would not recommend purchase this item
2.0,"Looks so cute on the model--of course, she is cute to begin with.  I am bigger than her--on me it looks like a tent.  I kept it, but probably should have returned it.  I'll wear it with a long sleeved tee and some tights--but it still looks big and feels big--and worst of all, it makes me look big.  The material is thin, but it is not cheap looking.  The price is good.  Just too big."
2.0,"This sweater was very frumpy. I ordered it keep warm on my wedding day but, it was so frumpy that I had to deal with being cold."
2.0,"Pretty color but don't care for the fringe, there's no closure in the front, strange cover up."
2.0,Likened the shirt but was expecting more of a light sweat shirt .. it came super thin and like the other buyer it took me off guard it was a see threw white on back !
2.0,"Way too small. I'm so mad, I even went two sizes up."
2.0,"Returned items, material isn’t good for me"
2.0,"This is my second order of these ""hiking"" socks.  Sometimes my washing machine ""eats"" socks and for some reason it always eats the right sock.  So I'm left with a batch of left feet.  Anywho, I loved the comfort, feel and durability of the socks so I ordered what I thought to be the same sock.  (Ordered from my previous order). The socks have changed since my previous order.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The new socks are taller<br />Fit is great<br /><br />Cons:<br />The socks are not as comfortable and feel as if they have more synthetic material.  When you have the socks on with toe shoes, a comfortable feel is imperative.<br /><br />The socks are not as warm as the previous version.  I wear these socks during the winter months.<br /><br />I am.now in the process of looking for a new winter toe sock."
2.0,Way tooooo short. I’m 5’6” and it was about 5 inches too short.
2.0,"The leather strap is rather flimsy. Plus...even though i need a wider wrist band, this one is too big. I would not purchase this type of strap again."
2.0,"I love the colors, but the fabric is wayyyy to thin, you cant wear a bar and underwear alone under this because it is that seethrough.. I will need a tank top and spandex to be able to wear this in public. Highly disappointed, but glad it's was cheap at least."
2.0,"I already own the largest piece in this design in which i bought at my local Marshalls,  but I wanted the full set. The kitty design is adorable and it is really easy to pick out on the turnstile at the airport. I have gotten many compliments on it. The problem that I have with ordering it on Amazon is that in came in a ridiculously flimsy cardboard box. The luggage had a huge gash in it and was beyond repair. I had go through the trouble of repackaging it in a different box just so that it wouldn’t fall apart on my way to return it to the post office. I would not go through the trouble of ordering this luggage set from Amazon again, because I’m pretty sure it will be packed in the same kind of flimsy box with the great potential for another damage and return."
2.0,Returned these as soon as i opened them. They were very small and the wings were tiny and hard to put together.
2.0,The color is much more of a muted/dusty color than the picture shows.  The fabric is very thin.  It's tight around the bust and too loose and long at the bottom.
2.0,"The tire is not attached and took forever to try to feed they the hole, once I found the hole. The bottom seam has two loose strings in the hem so I’m not sure how long it’ll last. I went one size up from my normal size and it fits very well. The neckline does sit weird on my collarbone tho."
2.0,Purchased for pool. Easy on easy off.
2.0,The sweater doesn't look like this in person! More bright pumpkin orange in color and the sweater is way shorter than pictured.
2.0,"Disappointed. Thought I was getting knuckle rings, but they are regular sized rings. My fingers are a bit pudgy so they don't fit on the top or bottom of my fingers lol. Good thing they were so cheap. I found doubling up on the skinny ones is my best bet, even though they give me a little bit of a muffin top effect."
2.0,way too big - the picture looks danty
2.0,Slips off way too much even with the silicon pads on the back. I'm fixing my socks after every 20 steps or walking in a awkward way so they dont slip off.
2.0,"Super sad. The strap came broken. The dress arrive quickly and on time. Beautiful color. Full is sequence.  But with a broken strap, it's useless.<br />Also there really isn't good lining between your skin and the sequence."
2.0,A little disappointed of size. Thought it was a little bigger. I order a chain to go with it and not receive it yet
2.0,Not well printed .  The sweatshirt itself is of good quality though.
2.0,Cheap suede. Not recommended. Colour does not match. It's a little bit more reddish.
2.0,"Gold was too yellow, looks very fake. The cactus pendant it self was too big. I was looking for something smaller. From the pictures it looked like a lot smaller. Not happy with my purchase."
2.0,"Very cute, but wrong color! The boots were white, not winter white. My daughter now has the boots."
2.0,"The zipper was a real problem, right from the start.<br />I should have ordered an XL instead of L.<br />It was a nice looking coat. Sorry it didn’t work out."
2.0,"I purchased large and it was more like extra small. Thin material, not good quality. Very disappointed."
2.0,"This was a bit small, but not too bad since it is supposed to be tight. The real issue was the smell. Upon opening the bag, it smelled awfully of chemicals. I thought letting it hang for a few hours before trying it on would help and it really didn't. It was a terrible smell."
2.0,Bought a size larger than what I normally wear & they were still snug.
2.0,This dress is adorable but absolutely see through on the bottom half
2.0,"The very first time I tried the bracelet on, it broke.  I am going to try to return it.  It's a very pretty bracelet, but it must be low quality.  I am disappointed to say the least."
2.0,The picture began pealing immediately
2.0,I only got 14 instead of twenty. :(
2.0,These aren't bad shorts but they get 2 stars because the are much longer than 7 inches and they are baggy.
2.0,This item runs 2 sizes too small and is not the item pictured.  It shows it is long but it is a short one...
2.0,"I ordered Red, I received Hot Pink.  The White dress is super thin"
2.0,"This product looks so glamourous online, but when it came in the mail, I was appalled by how thin and cheap it looks and feels. There's no way I could wear this to a formal event - such as my work holiday party that I was planning on wearing this to. Something this thin would expose every nook and cranny on me. I can't wait to return it."
2.0,"I loved this anklet. Unfortunately it broke in under a week. I purchased it again, and same thing. Kinda knew that going into it bc of the great low price point. But if you’re careful with it, it could probably last you longer. I walk around barefoot as a yoga instructor and am at the beach a lot. So I’d say my wear ‘n tear is possibly higher than most. It doesn’t look cheap and hangs nicely. Super bummed about it breaking. I’m guessing I’m gonna have to bite the bullet and get a real gold one."
2.0,Super cheap and thin material
2.0,Way to thin
2.0,High waistline. Unflattering on my body type (chubby)
2.0,Tight and uncomfortable although it looks ok.
2.0,"The pants have torn in the crotch area and butt area down the middle, I’ve only worn these about 5 times. Look elsewhere, wouldn’t recommend unless you’re gonna use for just lounging but definitely not working out, if they stretch enough they are see through."
2.0,"I prefer the SZone brand, simply due to measurements.  I cannot fit apple laptop with case into the bag.  However, if you have smaller laptop, may work."
2.0,"Love the color scheme of this. It’s so retro and awesome. But unfortunately the fit was just off and I ended up returning it. Places say to size up for it, so I got a M instead of my normal S. But then the legs/hips fit and the torso was left gaping. The design creates a weird gap."
2.0,"It's very sad because I love dumbo, but in this pajamas the neck expanded. The printing of the drawing on the fabric is excellent, it only has that defect."
2.0,"The dress is cute, but extremely tight in the chest. This would be great for a girl that has a small bust."
2.0,"Ordered a size large purple. Material is fine but there is weird amount of space between the straps and arms, leaving a lot of room for armpit flab. Fits comfortably but looks uncomfortable. Will be returning."
2.0,Originally ordered a Lg but had to exchange for a Xl.  The Xl were no bigger than than the Lg.  Dissatisfied with the product sizing.  Elastic in the waistband does not stay in place due to it not actually being sewn in. I would not order from this brand again.
2.0,"I sadly have to return it.<br />1. It's red. I purchased Bordeaux. It's not a pleasant red either.<br />2. While it's very wide in the waist area and hips<br />3. Strange 7/8 fitted in the legs<br /><br />So it's pretty tight around the legs. My estimate is this will fit someone 5.2. I'm 5.6 and the legs are way too short for me.<br /><br />The tight legs with the fluffy part around the hip/waist, is not a good look for me."
2.0,I bought two pairs of these for my boys to go see monster trucks. I like the variety of colors and the folding aspect so they are easy storage. Hearing is muffled but I’m concerned it won’t be enough for something as loud as the trucks. The ear pieces keep falling out of their setting. They click back in but it’s annoying to have to constantly fix something that is brand new.
2.0,I ordered size small but way too big! However the material was good.
2.0,Loss  Colores están muy bien
2.0,They are hanging backwards.
2.0,"They are pretty, but I should have ordered the smaller size.  Plus these made my earlobes itch."
2.0,"I bought two sizes, 5 and 8 and they were just way too inaccurate in sizing. I bought the size 5 for my gf (she's 5 ft) and the wader is literally her height. I had her try it on and she looked like the old penguin from batman... or an oompa  loompa... so instead of opening the size 8 for me, I tried the size 5.. it fit me pretty well, aside from the waist to chest area. This was clearly made for someone who weighs at least 200 with my height (I am 5'6 160lbs).<br /><br />If you're ordering, I would size way down."
2.0,I ordered a med and it was way to big
2.0,"I love the design on the sides, but there was a rough edge on the side (almost like a wood sliver) and not very comfortable. Just seems cheaply made. I know they aren't super expensive but I had hoped for more. I ended up returning."
2.0,"It was a very cute idea, however it runs very small. I got an extra large hoping to have some wiggle room but it was still very tight and short. Wore it to virtual teach in but probably won’t wear out."
2.0,I thought it would be better quality...but for the price
2.0,The buttons doesn't go with the shirt and it runs small
2.0,I liked the material it was thick. I tried them on they actually fit very good. They were kinda loose towards the middle area. I had to roll them down my waste a little bit I think I should’ve gotten a size down. But I’m pleased. Don’t know if I’d buy again. They stain very easily.
2.0,The fit was very unflattering for me. And I didn't like the feel of the material the skirt was made of. I had originally ordered a black and green one and the shipping was delayed so I had to cancel it and order a different color and I really didn't like it nearly as much.
2.0,Poor quality the thread is very thin and not tightly woven. Not worth the price I will be returning.
2.0,"I really like this bag it is perfect for travel. However, the main zipper on the top of the bag is faulty and is difficult to zip. I did not return this bag because I needed it for my trip. Other than that it's a great bag."
2.0,"Not very breathable, diaper-y fit."
2.0,"I ordered black, blue, and purple.  I love the black and the blue.  They are beautiful and as expected.  The purple fits beautifully, but the colour is far from expected and the colour does not match the picture.  I am very unhappy with the ugly colour of the purple one."
2.0,"Its ok. Its not as nice as it looked in the pic, and its see through thin. I would not buy again."
2.0,Runs too big - size down
2.0,"The top I received was different from what was pictured. First, it's very sheer. You can see right through it. The pattern was not the same and did not look good. The sleeves were too open, if that makes sense. There was too much room there. The fit was not cute. I didn't like the color on me. Decided to return."
2.0,I ordered size 18-24 months and it fit my 3 year old who wears size 4T. The sizing is way off!
2.0,"I purchased the red ones (twice). While they do an amazing job of making your shoes look fabulous, they did not last more than 20 mins on my shoes. I wore these for my graduation celebration, looked down and one of them was not only missing, but when I found the one piece they were broken completely in half.  Too bad!! It's a great idea, however these have proven to be a complete waste of money. (Did I mention...I purchased them twice?). OH...the return service was excellent."
2.0,"I don't love this wallet.  I had hoped to be able to fit my phone and be able to just carry this with the wrist strap and leave the purse at home but that would never work for a couple reasons: First off it did not come with a wrist strap as advertised.  Second, it is way too tight to put much of anything in.  No way could I dream of fitting my iphone 7 in here (again as advertised).  I can barely get my 6 cards out of or into the slots.  The color is nice and exactly as expected but I don't imagine I will really use it without a wrist strap and since I can't fit even 6 cards in here."
2.0,"I know I'm buying something high fashion here. You get what you pay for but this was rather disappointing. The stones were glued horribly. They looked like a child had done it. That I could have overlooked because this was really only apparent up close. However, one of the main center pieces was not attached properly and hung crooked when worn. And it clearly should not look that way. The condition was not acceptable."
2.0,"How disappointing. When I got the robe, there were a bunch of fraying threads coming out all over! It is very light and a little cheap feeling, but it's fairly cute and convenient which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Seriously though, so disappointed with how the product was coming apart right out of the package."
2.0,"Looks great.  Appears solidly made. Bought as a gift, so have not used.<br /><br />Update 9 months after purchase -<br /><br />Cable unraveling which punctured the hand of the gift recipient. I've taped it up with electrical tape - not too flashy.<br /><br />The similar cable key fob she received was still in good shape after five years, so can't blame her for excess wear and tear.  Too bad - even the Honda service people were impressed by its design."
2.0,"Purchased the plus size. WAY too small. Perfect if you're a size 8, which is most definitely NOT plus size. Incredibly disappointed."
2.0,"I may have received a size too large for me, however the size said on site that it was true to size, and all my tshirts are a medium. This tank feels like silicone, i'm just not a fan. It's too thick and although it may be moisture wicking, it's too uncomfortable to wear long enough to find out."
2.0,Had to return this. I am almost 5'9&#34; and the bust line was too high. You would need a really long torso and high bustling to make this fit. Very disappointed.
2.0,This was very small. Not stretchy! Not comfy for a child to wear.
2.0,Clasp broke after first time wearing
2.0,I like the hat...bit it came with the little logo upside down.
2.0,Pretty cool glasses but definitely a little feminine in their appearance.
2.0,Did not fit ....
2.0,Leaves this white powdery residue. I bought it to clean the hardware on my purses and it made the leather all dusty and powdery.
2.0,Fits ok but way to long for a shorter person.
2.0,Zipper came off in the dryer in 3rd wash
2.0,Didn’t really care for it or the material. I ordered my normal size but maybe I should’ve gone up two sizes. I ordered a large
2.0,Dont waste your money. The sole tears easy.
2.0,It fits ok and looks nice on my wife but she doesn't like the material that's why I returned it.
2.0,This was advertised as one size fits all.  I am an average size male and they are too small for me. That's with them adjusted out as far as they would go.  I sent 2 emails to Copper Compression regarding the issue and have yet to hear from them.  Not up to the same standard as their Arthritis Gloves or Knee Brace. I ended up giving them away.
2.0,"As with some other reviewers of this brand, I found the bead I was sent was not nearly as colorful as pictured. Mine is pale blue, and definitely not the look I was going for. But that is the hazard of buying on Amazon."
2.0,My boyfriend is about a 34 and we got him a Large. It was WAY too small.
2.0,Was too tight on calf even though it was plus sized.
2.0,"Wanted to wait before I write a review on this ""watch"" the watch is good until its not. Coming off of night shift this watch was great. I was using the QR code scan feature with the shock which is slight pinch in the morning it gives you 3 zaps then waits 15 seconds before delivering the next round (all adjustable) I should've trusted the reviews the watch lasted for about a month and a half now the shock feature is pretty much dead :( going to try and contact them to receive a new one. I mean for the price this watch should've been 30 bucks especially if its gonna die in a month"
2.0,Would fit great if I had a size up
2.0,They are very large and heavy. I didn't like the quality either
2.0,The purple looks plum in the picture but is really a royal purple. Not my color but a really great dress for the price. I wish it came in more colors.
2.0,it works a little she shape really didn't work for me because it shows where it's on through my shirt and it didn't really lift i have other ones that i buy from walmart that are way better
2.0,"I got a small. I’m 5’3, 115 lbs and it’s a little big. I got green and I wish I would have gotten black. Green is a tad bit see through from behind."
2.0,Both broke before I could leave the house. You can't tell which links need adjusting so I just sent them back.
2.0,They really do look big and fake and cheap. Color rubs off and heads don’t last. Not worth it.
2.0,I gotta be honest I bought these socks in a 12 pack a few years ago. Were they the best I’ve ever had?? No but they were ok. I went to my purchase history in Amazon and bought these.  These came and they are only a six pack and they are a different color on the bottom of the sock. They are not the ones that I originally bought. Just wish I would have been told that they weren’t the same. Aside from that they are comfortable.
2.0,The saddle is a little shallow causing them to fall out. And one had a defect on one side and wasn’t round. I also thought the front and back would be flat but they’re beveled out.
2.0,Too small  soft but not good quality.
2.0,Supposed to be extra large but comes extra small. The people in Asia do not use the same measurements as those of us in the U.S.
2.0,It was too small the measurements are not correct and the material is not what I expected.
2.0,Sizing was not true to size. Size up two sizes for a good fit.
2.0,Size was to small and ripped when I put them on had to throw them away
2.0,NO SE LOS RECOMIENDO
2.0,Beautiful but not quality wear...Bracelet broke one week after receiving it (and I was very gentle with it).
2.0,"These took so long to get to me that by the time I got them it was past Amazons return grace period. The pants are nice quality and comfortable but I did not like how they looked on me. When I tried to return I contacted the seller and they offered a return and refund but only if I sent pictures with a good explanation of why which is uncomfortable after I already expressed that the product wasn’t the problem it was that I didn’t like it on myself, so the last thing I wanted to do was put them back on and snap a picture just to get a refund that I wouldn’t have had to go through all these hoops if it didn’t take a month to get to me. The seller was kind but now I’m stuck with pants that I don’t like how they look on my body."
2.0,Color not as shown. Purple is more pinkish burgundy.
2.0,"I like the look, but it's SO uncomfortable. I'm a size 4 and got a large, and it is way too tight in the underarm area. The stretch material rides up my torso. Not sure a larger size would solve this; there seems to be a proportions issue with the cut."
2.0,Purchased a medium in black paisley and it was too short and very tight in the chest area so I ordered a large same color. The arm holes are huge and again this dress is short. I was expecting it to be a bit more stretchy and not so sheer. Feels more like a very thin cotton not polyester. After reading the reviews I don’t think all of these dresses are the same so maybe it’s just a flaw with the black paisley.
2.0,"First things first, not silk......100% polyester. Not to mention, the amount of shine on these handkerchiefs would surprise you.....look like a freshly waxed car. Only reason there are 2 stars here is because of the number of colors. Shine.....shine.....shiny."
2.0,Way too small watch carefully for measurement.
2.0,Product didnt have the spring bars . Package didn’t have none of the 3 spring bars it mentions.
2.0,bag scratched and not shipped in original packaging
2.0,"Received bag today, was so excited until I got a look at the bag. I guess my initial question was &#34;where was the rest of the bag&#34;...lol ..way,way -much,too much smaller than what I wanted or expected. Cute bag none the less, just not for my taste.....I have too have a much bigger bag..."
2.0,Run small and very little stretch.
2.0,"This had absolutely no stretch to it, not even the elastic waistband!"
2.0,Pants were too small even though i ordered a XXL.
2.0,quality of fabric and collar are not as expected. Collar could be smaller and a better fit.
2.0,My daughter loved these.  But after one day wearing the seam in the butt came apart. They were not tight.  It was just poorly made.
2.0,Lovely but sleeves do not fit to size.
2.0,"If you're a medium, definitely get the L size. Runs very small."
2.0,"Front top button  is stitched  so flimsily,  it came off  the  first  time  I  put  it on...!  Fitting is good tho,  does<br /> not  come with a belt,  no  tears  so  far  but am forced  to  wear  it  withy my belt(since button came off so easily),  avoid this product,  should have stuck  to Walmart to buy shorts.<br /><br />Color:  Grey"
2.0,They were super cute. But the glasses have a really bad glare that gave me a headache.
2.0,wore out in 1 trip each
2.0,This was my second one and I was actually happy with st first but a month down the line the looping mechanism starting not catching and the return window ran out so I'm stuck with a loose belt .
2.0,"Not my favorite,  only because they kept sliding down and didn't cover my whole bicep."
2.0,"I was sooo excited when I bought this.  It was more than I would pay for a sweater but I liked it so much I splurged.  I counted down the days until It came.  I got it today.  It is not cute.  It does not look embroidered, it looks like a cheap sweater you buy at goodwill.  AND to top it off half of the yellow Pom-Pom’s are half torn off.  It is warm, which is the only good thing I can say.  I did buy the black and the contrast may be why it looks so cheap.  The other colors may work well but this is going back.  Super disappointed.  :("
2.0,None of the zippers would stay closed. They would unhinge and items would fall out. Ended up donating to Goodwill within a month.
2.0,Glasses still fogged with the product
2.0,"Beautiful, changes color as promised.<br />But the chain is too short for my 8 y old!!!<br />She can’t wear it over her head. Chain is short and it can’t be open in order to put it around the neck. Was it designed that way or i got a defective chain?!"
2.0,"the necklace was broken , material was so bad . wasted my money"
2.0,"The kimono has 2 tears in the left sleeve, and the butterfly is broken in half. Super cute costume, but I’m sad it came ruined. I’ll be returning."
2.0,Overall not bad. Stars given was the result of the product shipped to me in a plastic bag. My items were stuffed inside a small plastic bag. Not to mention it arrived late as well.
2.0,"It was recommended by other buyers to order larger than normal. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. I order xxl and it was way too large. I washed it hoping that it would shrink a bit but it did not. It came out really wrinkled after washing and drying. It is hanging in my closet, never worn."
2.0,Was a little surprised these are T-shirt material not sweat pants material. I was looking for warn sweat pants and these are not warm material. T-shirt material.
2.0,Pretty but arrived with 3 stones missing.
2.0,"Although I really like the safari design & they fit amazing, I am not a fan of the Supplex fabric. It says it feels like cotton but I disagree. Once I get them on it's not so bad, but just the thought of having to touch them makes me shiver. Maybe it's because my hands tend to be a bit dry during the winter...either way it feels awful."
2.0,"Difficult to line up properly, they slip off, but will continue to try"
2.0,I really wanted to love this dress. The yellow color is gorgeous but the material is very thin and see through. I wish it was lined or something. The dress itself is  super<br />Comfy but the material was a big no for me
2.0,It is MUCH smaller than I anticipated. Almost  the size for a child
2.0,"The i hate people graphic is good quality, but the shirt is not 100% cotton as advertised. It is 35/65 polyester/cotton. I don't usually wear polyester and bought it because it was 100% cotton so my review is low for false advertisement."
2.0,no strong  its oaky for 2weeks my be
2.0,Elastic at waist and on legs is not covered with fabric and was too thin for my liking.  I returned it.
2.0,"I was not pleased with the plastic frames.  My glasses are thicker than the hooks would accept.  The lenses were not he amber that I prefer. and the size was too small, even though I ordered the largest size."
2.0,It said that this is for BIG GIRLS!!! These are ADULT sizes!! Very disappointed :(
2.0,Do not look like the photo.  Just look black.  Still fun but not what I was expecting....
2.0,This is not at all a sweatshirt and it's cheaply made.
2.0,I have ordered many caps from Amazon but this one is strange. I expected a rounded BRIM.. this one is SQUARE.
2.0,Not much stretch in these
2.0,"While these look lovely enough (bright silver, modestly sized round, studded charms), they arrived with a majority of the stones missing; they weren't even present in the bag so I could glue them back on."
2.0,I typically wear a size 2-4. I purchased the small in this dress and it was WAY too tight. The material is very thin and very clingy.
2.0,I like it as a gift but it was too small in size and needed longer chain so the trinkets could hang separately not side by side
2.0,I did love  the colbalt blue color however the gem was just too small it was not noticeable in my French braid or French  twist. So I.returned it
2.0,More than 50% of seashells with broken ends. Bad quality. I do not need trash.
2.0,"Cheaply made, short and not true to size"
2.0,Bottoms are too small. Sizes listed don’t align with true size. So now can’t wear. Love the material and colors.  Was just what I looking for! Too bad money wasted.
2.0,I think the dress will fit better for short people. I am almost 5’6 and weight 120 pounds. I ordered a small. The dress is too tight and the waist line fits right above my chest.
2.0,The material was horrible and cheap. Definitely get what you pay for. I will never wear this😕
2.0,"Purchased as a gift for lady who itakes 4-6 Petite pant, XS or S.  I ordered the Small.  She could not get over her slim legs. Material is soft but the waist has no stretch.<br />I measured the waist at 22"", seller size chart shows 26-27"".."
2.0,"The material was larger than expected on the top, but the bottom did not thing to control the tummy. furthermore, the line where the top of the ""bottoms"" cut into the stomach was not a flattering spot, so it kind of cut off a more flabby section into 2 pouches of flab. There is nothing about this cut or material that helps with tummy control. Would not buy again."
2.0,Way too long & not what I expected.  I returned it.
2.0,"The dress itself was beautiful- great fabric and length, but it runs small. The elastic around the middle/waist area is not very flexible and hit me in a weird area, so it accentuated my belly. I would suggest going a size up if you order."
2.0,"Is the model in your picture a little person? Do I have a massive Charlie Brown head? Because I don't think I do, but according to these ears I just received I must. The ears are cute but are not the pictured size. Perhaps you could find a normal sized adult to model your ears? (Not a slight on the vertically challenged, just pointing out that for marketing purposes you should take into account that the average sized adult is above 3 foot 2 inches. with a head size of about 9 lbs. That was a Jerry McGuire reference. As for the tail, this would work great as a rat tail for Peter Dinklage should his Game of Thrones character ever make some sort of weird transformation into a rodent who drinks wine and knows things. As for me, a 5'11 woman who many have ""kindly"" referred to as ""big boned"", this will not work."
2.0,"This is a package of three Cotton Spandex bike shorts. The fit is good. One huge problem that renders them unusable. When the shorts were made they were made out of two different colors of pink fabric. One pair is bright pink on the right side and a softer pink on the left side. One pair is bright pink on the left side and a softer pink on the right side. The third pair is without issues. I tried to get the company to remedy this for me but was unsuccessful. However being FBA, Amazon stepped in and did an awesome job for me. To Amazon I give 5 stars. To these shorts, I give them to the garbage man. That may sound harsh but I tried to fix this appropriately and did not succeed.<br />I received these at a discounted price for my honest review and feedback and they aren't worth the discounted price. Sad."
2.0,"Does not fit how it should. The top is too tight, it goes on but too snug to wear"
2.0,"I mean for the price, I didn’t expect much…but didn’t last longer than 3 mins before the shorts ripped!  They served their immediate purpose but don’t waste your money"
2.0,Tight and way too see through in the white area.  Nothing left up to the imagination. Veru light weight fabric and not much support. Good style but not enough to get more than 2 stars
2.0,"product has a stretchable waist band, but the material is extremely cheap. i ordered an XL and i am 5’4 and 160 with wide hips and a booty.. this XL was so tight around my hips/thighs/booty. the product was also not the same color. it has the dark colors, but what i thought was white is a very cream/light tan color."
2.0,Not a very well made shoe . The materials look very cheap I am returning the boots
2.0,Stone fell off
2.0,The hat was OK but it is just a iron on sticker on front it should have been monogram  or some thing else my husband will not wear it
2.0,Runs small and did not like the way it fastens. Never wear it.
2.0,"I saw this watch and it just seemed so cool looking and something completely different. I did like the look of it when it arrived but then I realized how hard it was to connect the clasp on the band. It took a while to figure out to clasp the band together. It  does require two hands to clasp the band, so there is not an easy and quick to put on the watch. Also, there was no way to adjust the band so it was loose on my wrist. I figured I would need to go to a watch shop and pay to have the band adjusted. It wasn't worth the time or money to have the band adjusted so I returned the watch. I did like the look of the watch and wish the band had not been an issue."
2.0,"The material looks ok, Size is completely wrong I bought a 3XL and It fits as XL."
2.0,You cannot tell what paw prints are because the ring is so thin!
2.0,They came apart after my son wearing them 2 times
2.0,"Being a new transplant to the Midwest, I learned very quickly that winters are tough. That shouldn't stop me from riding. When these gloves came in and were used the first time, its like another piece of the puzzle was placed correctly. I feel like I could conquer the world with warm hands now! Easily chargeable, easy to use, and overall very comfortable. I love these gloves!<br /><br />Update 10/31/2022<br />It's now randomly cold again in the midwest and it's time to use these puppies again, except that I no longer can. The pinky seems to of shrunk from the heat to where it is so uncomfortable to wear that they are now useless. Once again, I am on the hunt for hand warmers that won't melt ."
2.0,Way too big plus it look irregular
2.0,it's too large (wide) for me.But it is pretty.
2.0,This item broke the second time I went to put them on and is NOT ELIGIBLE for a return? I'm only giving two stars because they are so pretty.
2.0,"This jacket is sold as a men’s but  I’m pretty sure this is the women’s jacket since the zipper is on the opposite side of every other jacket I own.  Also, I purchased an XL and it is VERY small.  Overall the jacket is very thin, not like most bomber jackets I’ve seen."
2.0,"You think it is a quality glass even if it is cheap because it says Mercedes sunglasses. You think it must be good quality, however, it is in the sale and maybe it is discontinued and that is why it very affordable. However, when I got the glasses, I was surprised at how cheap it is. It is something like a dollar store glasses, but it comes with a box."
2.0,"These would be at least 4 stars, but one of the silver rings tarnished to a horrible black in places after only 2 weeks of wear. I had another pair of these that I wore for over 10 years continuously (I keep them in my top of the ear cartilage piercings) that NEVER discolored.  I have messaged the seller for a replacement but have not yet heard back. I will update if they are willing to replace."
2.0,I love the way these look but it's super hard to open and close them! I haven't been able to wear the silver or gold at all because of this.
2.0,wanted to use this to remove a stain on my yellow suede purse due to some denim rub-off. no english instructions on product. arrived as a brick in a box with foreign language instructions. read other comments for a clue and proceeded to work on my purse. stain is still there. maybe a little fainter but still very much there.
2.0,Wore it twice and it stretched out to the point that it no longer has support.  Im a 34 C.
2.0,Cute but extremely small!
2.0,"Cheap. I had to do some modifications to it. It has really cheap quality tool fabric in between layers in the skirt making it very loud when you move and super puffy like a costume poodle skirt.  Cut that all out of the skirt and it's not as puffy but the skirt material is a cheap plastic like nylon. As long as you don't look closely it's not too bad, I doubt it will hold up well for multiple wears however."
2.0,Im 6'2 and 190lbs.  In this photo all the belts are set at their shortest length.  The sun belt still falls off my waist and the over the shoulder sword belt falls off easily too and is way too big.<br /><br />There were no sizing options at the size of purchase.  Overall the quality was surprisingly better than I thought it would be for the price.<br /><br />Just have better sizing and this would be a great buy
2.0,I was looking for more of a compression fit. This was very stretchy. Short on length and rises up easily.
2.0,Did not come with the brown tie around the outside of the hat. Disappointed
2.0,the gold is not the same color as shown in the picture. one of them broke within first use.
2.0,Hi My charm is changing colors is there anyway I can get a refund?
2.0,"The material seem to be strong but within 2 weeks the pin broke, the watch fell and the glass cracked"
2.0,Demaciado transparente
2.0,"After three months, the plastic wore out on the left ear strap.  it was where it connected to the metal front piece.  Looked like a brittle plastic collapse at the weakest point.  They were fun while they lasted."
2.0,not for plus size women
2.0,"Material doesn’t feel as soft compared to others at the same price. I do not like the fit. The horn buttons are much lighter brown than they look in the product photo. I don’t like how the collar wears. I don’t see myself wearing this, I’ll likely give away.<br /><br />I am 5’6, 36C, 29 waist, 38 hips. In order between a small/medium, 6/8."
2.0,"I guess I'm not the first person this has happened to, but I received gold mirrored glasses (despite the title saying &#34;mt black-red&#34;). They are nice glasses, but not what I ordered."
2.0,Frames are flimsy and the lenses make things look distorted.
2.0,Most of the huggie pairs either won't open or they won't stay closed again when you put them on. The post earring options are ok.
2.0,Its not beautiful
2.0,"The arm holes didn't have a good shape, they flopped inwards."
2.0,Weird fabric and weird fit to it; unlikely to wear it and would not suggest it for anyone
2.0,The chain is pretty but too delicate.  I should have spent more money and purchased a heavier weight.  The bonus chain extension included was not yellow gold but white gold so cannot be used.
2.0,"I have ordered Baleaf workout v-neck shirts before and they have been great! This time, I was a bit disappointed because the shirt was poor quality, see through and not very flattering like the prior ones."
2.0,Will tarnish and turn copper color
2.0,"You get your money's worth, which is not a lot. Cheap material and poor finishing."
2.0,"Oversized bill, small for and awkward style. Overall a goofy had that doesn't fit."
2.0,Returned. Bottoms were good. Top was way too fitted and narrow. If you are a junior size 2 the top would be perfect for that person.
2.0,"[[ASIN:B00RQZ96B6 Mormaii Floater Surf and Sport 57mm Polarized Sunglasses, Black with Red Trim]]<br />Like an idiot, I bought these twice.  First time I had them, the right lens popped out and after looking EVERYWHERE for a replacement set and not being able to find them, I just bought the whole damn thing all over again.  and by saying I looked everywhere….I mean everywhere.  I even contacted the guy that owns the company that makes these things and he wouldn’t help me out.  So,  bought them again because I wanted to give them a fair shake and…..wouldn’t you know it…..the right lens popped out again.  now I have donated 2 right lenses to the Pacific.  Before the lens popped out I can tell you this, they are uncomfortable as all hell, the rubber guard they insert into them to keep them away from your face restricts your vision a massive amount and, they fog like crazy. I mean….like CRAZY.  Restricted vision, foggy lenses that pop out and painful to wear.  Yeah…..skip these and find something else."
2.0,The shoes were delivered already worn. The soles were dirty. I can’t return because she needs them for her birthday in a week. I’m really disappointed but I guess she’ll be too excited to notice the dirty sole...
2.0,"I really loved the suit and fit, ordered a medium when I usually wear an XS, but the top mesh arrived ripped. So that's really disappointing"
2.0,"It is good quality at this price point, but you can order 2 size down it could be still consider as &#34;over sized&#34;."
2.0,"Slim sizes. I ordered xl for a large fit but even 2x would have been ok. It ""fits"" bc I wear it open if u want to button together then 2 sizes up For sure. Smooth fabric probably better with out softener and hang to dry. Very nice deep black minor stitch imperfections love the length, about 2"" past finger tips at hip"
2.0,The material is far TOO thin.
2.0,It's big. Looks nice. But most of the watch is fake decrotive stuff. 4 buttons are nonfunctional and 2 time zones are fake.
2.0,"When I saw this watch on sale for $15.99 I had to pick it up. When it arrived, at first I thought this was a steal for the price. It wasn't but a few weeks later it's flaws began to show through.<br /><br />The band has already worn out on one side so much that the pin that holds the band to the watch broke at one end and the band came off. After only a few weeks of use this is unacceptable.<br /><br />Looks 4/5<br />Build Quality 1/5"
2.0,Terrible! Looked like it had already been worn. Huge snag on the sleeve and across the front. Also a  glue spot on the bottom of the dress.  It ran really small too. Disappointing. Back it goes!!
2.0,They slip off my feet all the time
2.0,I personally felt like this shirt ran small. It was cute but the material was different.  I returned the shirt and received my credit for it.  Several weeks later I received a email saying shirt wasn't returned when it was returned along with several other shirts I returned at the same time.  So paid for a shirt I didn't keep
2.0,"This is a pretty band. It pinches my skin. It comes undone very easily. It is difficult to assemble, and the pins randomly disengaged this morning sending my band new watch to the floor."
2.0,I was really hopeful but the fit was somewhat irregular and sloppy but I am also very picky in how my clothes fit.  It was only around $10 though so I will just give it to someone else.
2.0,The isn't strong enough and unravels when you pull bracelet close
2.0,NOT A GREAT PRODUCT...CROSSES WERE UNEVENLY WELDED
2.0,"I have mixed feelings with this product, I do not like it very much. I bought size L after reading the comments, however I stay a little big, I weigh 155 pounds and I measure 5.5 inches.<br /><br />PRO<br />- It's the same as the Amazon photo.<br />- The coral color of the girdle is very cute.<br /><br />CONS<br />- The fabric does not feel comfortable on the body<br />- At the waist has no garter (a broad band) and fits with a cord, which makes it uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"The shoes are really cute. My daughter LOVES the way they look. HOWEVER, there is a part of the stitching inside the shoe that is so uncomfortable that my daughter won't wear these. She yells when we put them on. She has small, narrow feet and these shoes are the next size up so it's not a sizing issue. Very disappointed. She loves Frozen."
2.0,I really like the look but on line looked better They look cheap.
2.0,"It was not worth the purchase. For one, it is significantly smaller than I was expecting it to be, even after reading reviews. Next, it’s from ROMWE. Don’t get me wrong, I like Shein and websites alike, but I was expecting to get something of decent quality, hence why I came to Amazon and not those sites for this item. It is paper-thin. The cuffs are super tight. I thought it would be heavier and fit in a more appealing manner. I’m happy for those who enjoyed it! I did not."
2.0,This t-shirt was a knockoff and fit way too large.
2.0,This watch feels cheap and is much darker than the photo that is shown on this site...
2.0,The cup sizing is really off.  I returned.
2.0,not easy at all to adjust.  Gold color wears off the band quickly.
2.0,They look great but they are way to small for a man arms
2.0,Once you insert the tap through the charger hole youwould think it would essentially work very well but when I went to plug in to charge with  the little plastic tab for. the lanyard on and it wasn’t enough room for the cord to fully engage so it’s not working for me.  I was Disappointed was hoping thi son would meet my need
2.0,The sunglasses were bent weird and did not sit on face properly. I guess that's what I get for not going to the store to buy my sunglasses.
2.0,"They were nicely made--so soft!  The problem is, these run AT LEAST 2 sizes smaller than marked."
2.0,"Color is nice, however, it felt like a slip. I gave it away."
2.0,"Romper has no shape and doesn’t stay up, the top just flops over"
2.0,They are very cute but they are way to small for what the size says.  My daughter wears size 3 and these were right to the toe on her.
2.0,mor or less
2.0,Small runs too large. So it’s not possible to change for a smaller size.  The dress doesn’t look fancy as it seems on the picture. It look cheap....
2.0,Not as comfortable as the actual crocs. These are a hard plastic. I will go with the actual brand of crocs the next time they are just as expensive as the crocs anyway.
2.0,Glasses are not dark enough
2.0,They are really cheap and they don’t seem polarized.. the case they came in was nice though but that’s about it..
2.0,The red color on it is so dirty and it’s made of really weird feeling rubber. I am returning this
2.0,"This dress is made poorly, the fabrics are low quality and very rough. Not something I want to put on my baby's skin."
2.0,not anything like the picture. UGH
2.0,"As soon as I took these boots out of the box, I realized that the picture I saw online looked different than what I got.  The fabric making up the boots is cheaper-looking in person, plus, the ""fashion"" tape runs all the way up the back of the boot.  So, looks alone were enough to make me want to return them.  Also, they were about a half-size too big.  Didn't have any trouble returning them, though, and I've already received my refund."
2.0,"The fit is about a half size small and the cut is awkward, I have to wear this hat much further back on my head to get the brim to sit where most driving caps sit normally."
2.0,The jacket leaks in the rain!
2.0,"I loved this. However, when it arrived the entire interior lining of the arm had not been sewn. Furthermore, the rest of the linking was way to big for the actual coat. It stuck out of the sleeves and at the bottom of the jacket.<br />I wanted to like it but i was absolutely ripped off."
2.0,I love the color but they are to small
2.0,"The color is actually more of a dusty rose color, almost dingy looking, especially the cuffs. I washed it as soon as I received it because of the ""musty new clothes"" smell. It appears to be large/long for the size I bought. I won't know until my granddaughter opens it for Christmas. It just doesn't appear to be a true Carter sleeper. May just donate this one and go to a Carter store."
2.0,I really think this bathing suit is cute but one of the straps were sewn twisted. Also the bottoms were very tiny. They looked longer on the legs in the picture.
2.0,They looked cool until I put them on. I'm very aware my head is large which is why I ordered them but these are tight. So tight I have to pass them on to someone else. Cool color and shape
2.0,"I ordered this for my 13 year old daughter, who is a really small girl. It's so small that it fits my 7yr old daughter."
2.0,"These unfortunately arrived damaged, not surprisingly as they are quite fragile as they appear to be balsa wood"
2.0,"They look cute, but they definitely don't fit the OS model as advertised (90-150 lbs.). They barely fit over one leg! They are stretchy, however, and once stretched out they're quite see through. I recommend these for novelty. To use as lingerie would be potentially destructive for sanitation and health. Eek!"
2.0,"Seems like the green ones aren’t the same sizing as the other colors, kinda weird. Definitely go for any other color."
2.0,"Nice colors, however the coat was super small in the arms for the age group, and was really very flimsy and thin for the price."
2.0,Cute shoe. Way to narrow and small
2.0,Arrived fast and product was well made however it caused a rash so not recommended for those with sensitive skin!
2.0,"The necklace came packaged in a nice sturdy plastic box and had bubble wrap. However, the earring came with the big center jewel missing :( Must be low quality. However, you are paying for what you get. It is a pretty set that you can rock maybe once or twice, but I don't think it'll last longer then that."
2.0,I loved it at first. Wore it daily for about 3 weeks. Never got it wet. One day it fell off and I thought I just didn’t snap it on all the way but it actually completely snapped in half where it connects to the Fitbit. Maybe I received a bad one but for the price they just might not be made well.
2.0,sorry.  couldn't figure out the strap in back.  front hung too low.
2.0,"It’s laughable that they call their small a 4/6. I’m a 4, couldn’t even get the buttons close to one another."
2.0,I like it just was too small. Would like to send back for a size bigger
2.0,I expect a better material more ticker
2.0,"The dress is not as pretty as in the picture, but it would have been cute. However, you can’t tie the dress bc they put the strings on both sides in the same place. It leaves the dress open!<br />Unless they give an answer on how to tie this, I’m sending it back!"
2.0,not what I thought would be and not much support
2.0,very manly!
2.0,I did not like this sweater at all.  It is stiff and scratchy and runs small.  I know it was inexpensive but I had hope.  Now I just say it is cheap.
2.0,Unfortunately this didnt work as expected. The fit is very comfortable however the shorts kept rolling down. It didnt stay in place. It was a hassle try to unroll it back up. Not happy at all with this purchase.
2.0,"Looks too fake.  Nice watch but couldn't really pass as gold.  Color is too bright. Beside my solid gold ring, it looks like a neon color"
2.0,"This hat was huge. It  was  too  big  nit  only for  my  toddler, but  also  for  me, his  mom. I'm not  sure whether wrong size  has  been  shipped  or  they are  all  like  that, because  it  doesn't indicate  the  size  anywhere. Returning."
2.0,"Very, very cute and versatile - matches with gold or silver jewelry, so I could wear these all the time.  I would say they were NOT super-small as others have posted.  The moon goes beyond my lobe.  However: I believe the posts might be short, as the star dug into my lobe and caused a lot of irritation (to the point that I can't wear earrings until it heals).  (And I do not have extra thick lobe!!!!!  ;-)  I'm not sure these are allergenic, as I thought I understood from the description.<br />I probably would have returned these, but I threw out all the packaging.  If you don't have tough lobes, I might not recommend these."
2.0,"Ordered 4 sweaters in  2 xx to be sure of large fit... ordered last summer to have ready for winter. SURPRISE  !  took sweater on a trip with me to have a light cover. It was way ! way !  too small... wish I would have tried it one when I got them .... did not think a xx large would fit like size med !<br /><br />Please let me know if there is some way to exchange the sweaters for larger sizes.<br />Thank you , Kathryn Duke"
2.0,"Don't li ke these but will keep them since it will cost more to send them back.  These are definitely made for a man.  They are huge and very uncomfortable to wear.  I really want some bifocal sunglasses since I need them to read when in my car.  I need bifocals for women that have small area lenses and are dark, not necessarily reflective."
2.0,I love the thick jean material and they are definitely figure flattering but it seems that these are most likely not sewed perfectly as one side seems smaller than the other.
2.0,Eye holes are way too close together
2.0,"Looks and fits great, but broke while taking them off on the 5th or 6th time wearing them."
2.0,"These are very nice looking, but the 1st day I received them 2 of them broke!"
2.0,Its cute but the band is cheap and the metal piece broke off when I was trying to attach it to my watch.
2.0,"Did someone put the wrong size sticker on my shoe!? I pretty much always wear a size 6, so I ordered a 6. but these seem to feel more like a 7. As I walk, these shoes literally fall off my feet.<br /><br />Will be returning these."
2.0,"I bought these because I thought they looked really cool. I've owned a lot of captive bead earrings, but these are by far the hardest to get together. I don't even wear them because it's so difficult. Also, they're really heavy once they're in your ears."
2.0,Glove are not strong these fell apart in snow
2.0,Does not run true to size. Very disappointing
2.0,The listed size was not the same is that the fit. It was way smaller than what it's listed as it didn't fit me and I was really looking forward to these shirts but was very disappointed they didn't fit.
2.0,Lining does not meet hemline. Not work appropriate
2.0,They look nice but one got a big rip in the fabric on the first flight!
2.0,Too bad the stitching is all bunched up around the necks on both my shirts. It ruins the whole look of the shirt. Not worth the price . They look cheap
2.0,"No hem on end,  probably lasted only 1 wash"
2.0,Didn't like the material. Color not the same as pic posted online.
2.0,"Though it looked similar to the picture, the colors are all too bright. The nose is very pink. Not even close to flesh tone. The nose is twice as wide as it should be. Looks more like a cartoon character than a real face."
2.0,"Its the color, not the style, I don't care for."
2.0,I’m glad I only paid $6 for it. It’s not extremely flattering. I don’t love the neckline and the material kind of sits on my body strangely. I think it would be cute with a short or long sleeve shirt underneath. If it wasn’t so cheap I would return it
2.0,it is sized wrong
2.0,Damage came broken between my legs
2.0,Started falling apart after a few weeks
2.0,"Cheap stretchy material, no style."
2.0,"Very nice jacker material. But, way to tight at shoulders. Luckily, I know someone who needs one. And I will keep looking."
2.0,"Horrible smell, too big doesn't lie flat. Returning"
2.0,It way to short I haven't wore it yet because I have to find some tires or something to wear with it
2.0,"Cute & sparkly shoes. Ribbon was red versus the pink glitter on the shoes. My 5 yr old daughter wore them for a week. Complained of friction on her heel after the 1st day. Used with thin socks. Ribbon came out after day 4. Wore as flats without the ribbon, but sides started cracking. Cheaply made, but cute the 1st few days. Definitely not worth the price."
2.0,"I’m 5’6”, pear shaped and I bought a large. The material was not as soft as I was expecting and it was small. Like could barely move small. It might have stretched if I had kept it on for a while but it was high water panting and I was totally not into it. And tight even on my torso."
2.0,"In order to get the loose, drappy look of this t-shirt, you would need to order it in two sizes larger than you normally wear."
2.0,A little thinner material and baggy at the ankles..
2.0,"AS described above, it runs a bit small, the quality is not that great for the price. And it is difficult to get my refund."
2.0,They arrived not in a box. They are very flimsy and really not worth the money you can find a better set for a little bit more.
2.0,"I liked the feeling of the product fits well, and shipped fast. I only give a 2 star review because the first one I went to try on I barely got it over my head and the strap came off 😥"
2.0,"I ordered size 5/8, and got size 1/2. Whoever is selling these clearly doesn't have a ruler."
2.0,"The product was NOT as advertised.  Specifically, they description states that there is an expandable, waist on these pants.  That was not the case.  Unless the pants they sent me were defective, there was no expandable waist.  Returned them immediately and got a refund.  Ordered Hagar instead and was completely satisfied."
2.0,The fit was too small for me. I was hoping to size up but Amazon was out of my next size with prime shipping.
2.0,"The dress is cute but it runs small. I couldn't even button up my 2 year daughters botton on the dress. Your kid would have to be super skinny to fit in her own regular size, so I suggest to size up."
2.0,"This necklace is extremely heavy.  I like it, but I notice its weight all day long."
2.0,"I don't know what world this is an extra small,  but I don't live there. I'm 5&#34; and 95lbs and this is a tent on me. After receiving this item and trying it on, I looked at reviews and saw that an extra small fit someone 130 lbs. By no means is that an outrageous number but it's just not an extra small.<br />The fabric is nice and the dress itself is so cute. I just wish I didn't have to get this fitted now."
2.0,I bought a pair of the snowflake ones in small and I'm 5'2 and weigh 110. I had to pull the weigh over my belly to keep the crotch from hanging down and the legs come up up to my ankles. I gave it 2 stars because they were comfortable to wear around the house and somewhat warm.
2.0,NICE SHIRT BUT DID NOT CARE FOR THE WAY IT FIT.  SENT BACK WITH NO PROBLEM
2.0,I like the looks of it but the adjustable strap keeps failing to hold at the place I set I to so it's constantly falling off my head because it won't stay. Major letdown
2.0,Not actually chevron pattern. Cheap and very thin.<br />It's cute enough that I won't return it but not nice enough where I would buy it again or recommend it to a friend.
2.0,Great concept but terrible execution the chain often breaks and because of the style you are very limited in your range of movement
2.0,Cute idea but looks much cheaper then the actual price tag. I would not order again.
2.0,"These are cute and comfortable, but they do not fit.  I specifically shopped for the shoe size 10-12 because I wear an 11.  These were way too small and squished my toes.  I wasn't sure if I was getting 3 pair or 6 pair--happy to report it was 6 pair--but giving them away now."
2.0,"This is a cute belt, but the quality is poor and it started fraying after only one wear. Returned it for a refund."
2.0,"Fits fine,but what I ordered was petite,what I got was maxi .Have to cut off a large portion"
2.0,"The sizing is off and not only with the chest but also just in general (shoulders, waist, etc.). Plan accordingly and I would suggest sizing up!!"
2.0,"Wrinkles easily,  but soft"
2.0,It is too stiff and the large one has creases in the exterior of it from sometime being sat on it.
2.0,Size is too small and material is cheap quality.
2.0,Dress is pretty sequin is beautiful but it is not fitting at all. it scrunches up when you put it on.
2.0,I thought that I was getting a necklace and bracelet with this well I was wrong read the fine print
2.0,"I usually wear a medium in dresses like these, but this dress was huge! Unfortunately, I had to pay to ship it back after waiting over a month for it to arrive."
2.0,"Its not very loud, not what I expected to receive. I was disappointed when I received it."
2.0,"Material is like Pajamas.. I am sensitive to most synthetic stuff.. anyway, I returned it and after a few weeks I got a message to call Amazon after 8/28 and then Amazon said I had to wait until 9/1 to get my money back, 14 days AFTER I returned it. Meh."
2.0,Size runs extremely small!
2.0,"The medium is a large, at least for a person that is 5’1 tall... I couldn’t find the size chart so I got my regular size Medium tooo big..."
2.0,I loved this ring but it bent out of shape quickly. Very soft.
2.0,"Purse is cute, and will work for occasional use. The &#34;bling&#34; is glued on & started to peel up after 1st use."
2.0,It was too much like a T-shirt
2.0,I am short at 5 foot but this dress was short and the pockets were not flattering . Had to return.
2.0,So disappointing especially after the rave reviews. Not nearly as classy as pictured and I bought the tie-dye. Order a size down maybe a snug fit would have given it 3 stars.  Material is comfortable and very soft. I'm size 10/12 and large was too big
2.0,Loved the bracelet but after wearing it a few times it broke.
2.0,"were supposed to be here by July 21, arrived in September. Much bigger than the image lets on"
2.0,This is a really pretty top and it’s lightweight and comfortable however once it is wash the lace on the sleeves and the front tear and unravel
2.0,Not very sturdy and they run about a half a size too small. Won’t order them again
2.0,Might as well carry a soft duffel bag. No support and too short for a 6’1” man.
2.0,I bought this for my wife. It worked great for about two weeks before the elastic gave out.
2.0,I thought I was smart to order the 3X (i usually wear between 1X and 2X.... the 3x fits me like a U.S. made Large -- very disappointing.
2.0,"I would give these a 5 star because I have a pair in blue that I absolutely love but after washing once, the stitching pulled out and created a hole in the groin area.  Definitely not what you want to find out as you are changing in the locker room at the gym.  So disappointing because they fit great and stayed in place.  Plus I love the high waist.  Only reason this is two stars instead of one is because I've had my blue pair for months and they are still holding strong."
2.0,"Finally, an adjustable belt came that seemed pretty easy to use and durable. Then, within a week of using, the buckle came off and can't be put back on without super glue. I love ratcheted belts but I have not found one that is durable and doesn't break."
2.0,I actually do like the shoes and the way they look however I purchased 2 sizes a 7 & 10 in toddler.  I have a 2 & 3 year old.  The shoes that showed up the 7 fits my 3 year old and the 10 fit my 6 year old that wears a 13.  Why are the sizes so completely off from regular shoes??  Of course now I have to return the 10 wait from them to get to Amazon and then reorder a size 5 for my 2 years.  Annoying
2.0,"I like the robe.  It's well-made .  The fabric is fine.  The fit is fine.<br /><br />However, when it was tried on, there was something odd about the way it looks and it finally dawned on me.  The pockets are set too high.  The top of the pocket is set about 1 1/2 inches higher than the belt loops, so that the belt runs straight across the pockets.  Am returning it and it's really too bad.  Other than this -- but it's a big ""this"" -- it's a very nice robe."
2.0,So the material was a good quality but the sizing was way off. I ordered an xl and they barely fit a friend of mine who wears a med.
2.0,cute but huge - too big for people with a small nose bridge
2.0,It should be advertised as kids size.
2.0,"Not spandex, which implies it's stretchy. Simply cheap looking polyester."
2.0,It fit nicely & the quality was not as described. Fabric is paper thin & not warm at all
2.0,I must of got a dud because the stem of watch wont stay in and the time keeps stopping. It hard being a medical assistant and not being able to take pulses
2.0,There were only two in the package...
2.0,Just a cord no beads as shown in picture.
2.0,"Material was a lot flimsier/cheesier than I expected. Doesn't fit particularly well. Not impressed, but wearable for the price."
2.0,"I was also disappointed with the size of the bag.  It is much smaller than the measurements say that it is 13x10x3, it's more like 9x7x2.  Also it was shipped in plastic and arrived with scratch marks.  Although the surface of the leather was smooth, it was dull in appearance.  It looked used. It looks like it is a real coach bag but just too small and notnice enough for $250."
2.0,Nice design and very lightweight but I wouldn't recommend using this as a motor bike jacket. Very thin!
2.0,Its dens narrow and small!  The heel area very narrow
2.0,"I have bought this brand in the last and it has been high quality.  This one seemed cheap, very thin material, and very baggy."
2.0,I am an average size girl but they did not fit over my calves right. way too tight
2.0,"This review is after one year of use.<br /><br />I purchased the carry-on and the 26” both.  I love the look of these pieces.  As with aluminum luggage, the inevitable dents are part of their charm.<br /><br />The carry on bag is great.  But as others have stated, if you check these they are going to break.<br /><br />I lost a corner piece, and another corner is already missing 2 rivets.  I’ve read on here that others have had the same problem.<br /><br />I wrote to the company asking to buy replacement corners so I could repair and keep using the bag, but they have failed to respond.<br /><br />Sadly, I can’t find anyone who can or will repair them - not even luggage stores out of town to whom I would have to ship for repair.<br /><br />Unfortunate.  I really wanted these to work."
2.0,"Did they even check the dress before they shipped it?? The dress is very cute online but its not great quality, however I realize its only $50 so I cant complain for the price. But when I received the dress in the mail it had so many problems with it I am not sure where to begin. Ill start with the most noticeable, I could tell immediately something didn't look the same as what I remembered online, well one of the little lace pieces(left side when looking it dress) had come unsewn from the inner layer of dress so outer layer and lace piece were hanging really low and un-level with the rest of the dress, there was a hole on one side but its not hugely noticeable because of the layers, there is two ink lines on the dress, and there is somehow a stain on the front of the dress. I saw some really good reviews on this dress so maybe I just got a bad apple but unfortunately it was for father/daughter dance and didn't have time to get another one ordered! My daughter absolutely loves the dress so I'm hoping I can make it work. When I contacted the sellers they offered me 20% ($11) refund so I could take it to a seamstress. Although that is nice of them to offer, its not going to compensate me for the time or money spent."
2.0,It was listed as medium but fit more like an extra large
2.0,"so i got this for work (work in a kitchen) and it does the job hasnt broke with me putting my hands in water all the time, its not pretty and its face is huge which is actually what i wanted so for 7 bucks not bad oh but the light switch on the watch doesnt work but hey u get what u pay for<br />UPDATE so it been a few weeks at work and the light on the watch stop working after 4 days and no the watch doesnt work like ya 7 buck but i thought at least i would get a few months out of it before it died completly"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:1ba01a51dfeb9dd33ae20838922687e7]] The material around the neck is wearing out and is already shedding lint and loosing colour.  The cuffs are also showing the same signs.  Also the zipper male/female are not the standard for men.  Could live with that but very disappointed - only wore it twice.
2.0,"I had gotten this before as pattern to make similar ones, but not the same but lost it, so I ordered another one, it fell apart, the braid came unraveled, there were only 4 rings on it & they were badly tarnished with no medallion on it, it was NOT what I expected & the ones I made were so much nicer..I'll continue to make my own & possibly submit them to Amazon for sale as I'm a USA  certified jewelry artisan."
2.0,It’s doesn’t look exactly as pictured... lower quality and doesn’t really flare at the bottom.
2.0,"I purchased this item sometime last year,  I was stoked unfortunately that was short lived. The item is a little on the short side, it also begins to unravel a short while after and the bonding was exposed and begin jabbing me in the side."
2.0,"It might be Adult Size, but the mask fit super tight and was uncomfortable."
2.0,Way smaller than expected. Gave it to a friend as a gift after I realized the size issue and it looked great on her but it is very thin and not well cleaned up with all the stray threads underneath.
2.0,Runs small I ordered a medium and shoulder seems are a little small.
2.0,Pants are short and I’m only 5 ft 2. Top fit good
2.0,"Adorable and appear to be well made, but WAY too small. My toddler has always been true to size or a few months behind on clothes (she's 2-1/2 and wearing 18m, 24m, and 2T depending on brand. Got 3T and will only get a couple uses out of them because they're so small. Of course, I wash everything before I put on my kids so can't exchange for the next size up. To charity it will go."
2.0,"I thought it would look great.  I figured it would be a MADMEN type of dress BUT I was wrong. Does nothing to flatter my figure. Perhaps if I was super super skin OR in the adverse, if I was a super curvy chick, this might have looked good. I am neither. I am in between and this dress was NOT flattering on. I should have returned it...but I forgot about it, until it was too late. :("
2.0,I am not sure these are authentic authentic
2.0,"Pretty in the photo ad but murder on the feet and very poor quality shoe material. Glue around the sole of one of the shoes was very noticeable and especially on the lower part of one heel, where the heel appeared as peeling apart and then very poorly glued back as well. The slope of the heel makes it very uncomfortable to stand up or even walk, and at the toes the fit is too snug and very tight, too tight to wiggle the toes and painful. Also appeared that this order of booties had previously been worn and then returned back to the shipper, because I noticed the scuff marks were already at the bottom of the shoe, wear marks were at the sole and along side the toes too, there was even a small dark smudge at the outside that appeared like someone's toe had pushed pass the material and brushed against something and left the smudge, and a hairline crack was starting to form along the outside of the faux leather material. Asking for a full refund on this pair. Toes are too pointed and the heel is too chunky."
2.0,The elastic is too thin to hold shape on the body
2.0,"Cute but not great for iPhone, and some parts are falling apart already. Have used for maybe two weeks maximum."
2.0,Center spring may hurt the skin over the nose bridge. The lenses may not cover the spectacle lens
2.0,I bought the next sizes than my usually size and it still is a bit small. Material is also on light side and cheap.
2.0,Holds the girls i. Place. Has a horrible seam right in the middle of the girls that shows when worn under some shirts
2.0,"The product appears good so far. My 2 Star rating is because of the fact that I need to replace one of the metal plates of this product w/original OEM straps to get it connect correctly. I shouldn't have to be performing fixes to make this work. It should work out the box. Search reviews for a more in-depth tutorial on swapping out parts. Otherwise quality seems great and color perfectly matches original, Navy Blue in my case."
2.0,"flimsy - ok for delicate necklace, but did not meet my needs"
2.0,They don't last very long! Sole came apart from slipper about 2 months after wearing them. Not very well made 😢
2.0,No me gusto muy diminuta tela I muy desajustada
2.0,The shirt smelled a bit off when I opened the package. The cotton isn't very soft and the print is rough. Not very good quality.
2.0,"Fits small. No stretch, very thick fabric. It may be nice for the winter, but I live in Florida and the material is just too thick. Doesn’t stretch at all so it’s kind of uncomfortable."
2.0,I really loved this shirt all together but as soon as I opened up the mail package all I could smell was cigarettes. The shirt reeks of cigarette smoke Ive washed it twice now and can still smell it a little when I have it on. Maybe Im over sensitive to the cigarette smell being a non smoker but I couldnt even appreciate the shirt when I first got it I had to throw it in the wash before I would even attempt to try it on.
2.0,"The color of this dress is not as pictured - it is definitely BRIGHT Royal Blue. It is also a bit large for the size, I' 5'2"", 135lbs usually wear a large (12). This dress actually fit length wise but was a bit large elsewhere. Fabric is nice, dress is very pretty but the color is awful. Just didn't work & returned."
2.0,One side off the watch strap will not stay on.
2.0,"Bottom line: There are straps in the picture, but there is no strap in the package.<br /><br />I ordered the glass hoping to have something to wear when playing watersports, and I just found out that there is no strap included in the package.<br />Since there is also no instruction as of how to get one even if I am willing to pay. I will have to classify this product as below expectation, and therefore giving this product a 2-star."
2.0,"This jacket keeps me warm, is well fitted, and I like the bright orange for biking. However, I’ve had the jacket for a few months and the zippers are just horrendous. The pocket zipper jams 1/4 of the time on both sides. The zipper gets caught in the material which isn’t sized well. It drives me up a wall and basically since I’ve had the jacket one of the zippers has been jammed shut... I just alternate which I’m using when the other jams in a major way. I expected far better from HH in the way of basic construction."
2.0,"Ok, if this pajama set ran true to size.. this would be a win. It definitely runs small, I’m a medium and it was a little bit tight. I checked the tag “Made in China”... hence why it runs small. There’s a couple things you need to know. First of all, the tank is cropped. Not an issue for me, but may be for someone else. Secondly, the pants don’t have a regular draw string. Not one that’s sewn into the material. This one is on the outside with 2 loop holes on the waist. Which to me looks more like outer wear  then sleep wear. Again a non issue for me, but may be for someone else. Lastly, the color is advertised as black. But it’s not a true black, it’s charcoal gray. The lace on the tank is a true white though. This material is so soft and comfy. And I love the wide leg pants. I just wish it was a true medium. I won’t get many wears out of this set because of the size issue. I don’t know how comfortable this would be to wear to bed. I just tried it on and wore it around the house for a couple hours.  I haven’t washed it yet, so I can’t say if this set washes well. Like I said.. runs small so this wasn’t a win for me. But it’s cute though."
2.0,"Fit as expected from the reviews I read. Because of the price, I didn't mind it needing to but cut to a shorter length. That was an easy fix.<br />What was NOT an easy fix was the HORRIBLE smell. I read reviews with some claiming it had an odor but thought I would do like others and air it out. When that didn't work, I washed the sucker on the delicate cycle and it STILL REAKED of a fish smell. I would swear it was made in a fish  market . The TWO star rating is because I cannot get over the smell and will most likely have to make my daughter one this weekend, as she needs it for next week."
2.0,Doesn’t look like the pic
2.0,Could not get a card to work with it. Battery does not hold a charge. Seems very fly by night. Like something you'd buy from China not Amazon. I strongly suggest Amazon take this product out. If you do get it to work with a card the display is very good and buttons all work
2.0,"I was so excited to get this outfit! When it arrived, I tried it on and the top, which I thought would be scrunchy and fitted because of the elastic design, was super big. The elastic was not stretchy at all, very disappointing."
2.0,The bow popped off as I was putting them on. The material snagged pulling them up. Very cheaply made.
2.0,"I would have loved to give these to my husband and try them out, but… we received one shoe, not a pair. Quality seems average. Sizing seems a bit big."
2.0,"I like these glasses, but the arms fall off too easily. It’s very frustrating to be out with these glasses and have an arm fall off. I’ve had it happen on multiple pairs. If you buy these glasses, carry a small screwdriver and extra screws or you’ll be sorry."
2.0,The color is really nice and better than I expected. The problem is with the collar. No matter what you do it doesn’t lay right. It is the most uncomfortable collar like this I’ve ever worn. I wouldn’t buy this again.
2.0,Not a good quality shoe.
2.0,"The product looks good at the beginning and after a month some parts are coming apart, it's light so I can walk all day long but the quality is cheap."
2.0,"The bracelets lasted maybe an hour before my girls tried to adjust them and the bands came undone. Also the clasp on one necklace broke as I was putting it on one of my girls. The earrings, however, are super cute and good."
2.0,"Cheaply made, does not hold up well to daily use, latches broke quickly. Capacity is small and paper currency especially does not fit well in the slots."
2.0,Ripped. Super cheap. Smells weird.
2.0,"Low price , low quality.  On the second day of ownership the right side arm failed to open. Looks like the internal spring mechanism failed and the arm will not open.  Sometimes we get what we pay for. I hope others have better luck.<br /><br />The lens was nice tho. Very clear and the tint was spot on perfect."
2.0,"I almost thought my necklace didn't come with a pendent, that's how small the letter is. Smaller than a dime."
2.0,"excellent product, is just kids size at best.  barely fits petite wife."
2.0,did not include the bottoms but the top is cute
2.0,"The hoodie is way too small, a XXL fits like a large. Additionally the material is far too thin, it feels more like a T-shirt than a hoodie."
2.0,"I wanted a packable hat, and this is packable, but it's hard to shape it up after unpacking -- or even after taking it off and putting it on again. I had thought I could remove the band to use my own scarves, but no, and there's a mashed down (sewn in) bow at the back that looks ridiculous."
2.0,The inside of the purse is coming apart.
2.0,Threw it away. Not a good bra.
2.0,"It was shaped weird, very long and just too big. Also it was orange. Not yellow. A very gross orange, not flattering at all."
2.0,top is way too small for a 32DD....
2.0,Its a cute dress but too short - on the sleeves and dress length. Not meant for tall women.
2.0,"The fabric is way flimsier than I expected.  But for the price, I got what I paid for.  Might wear next summer, but definitely not a layering cold weather item."
2.0,Cheaply made busted with only a couple uses
2.0,"Fits too tight around arms, no stretch at all."
2.0,"It protected the glasses very well, but the clip is a weak link.<br />I could not recover the case so I do not know where it broke.<br />The item was securely clipped to a D-ring on a backpack, then it was gone.<br />The case worked well enough, I am sure my glasses survived their fall ... but that is only a guess.<br />If you never use the tether, this case will do an adequate job of protecting eye glasses."
2.0,"I am 6'4"" and 180lbs I ordered a large and the sleeves only just fit lengthwise. The torso is too short but I can pull feet of extra fabric away from myself.<br /><br />The sleeves and therefore the pads inside rotate around my arms and DO NOT PROVIDE CONSISTENT PROTECTION.<br /><br />The fit is terrible for me personally.<br /><br />Also definitely more of a jacket than a flannel, it's pretty warm."
2.0,Too short and tight — doesn’t cover your midriff. Cute but definitely for teen girls.
2.0,The silicone band broke already where it hinge to the watch part
2.0,made for a size zero!
2.0,"Don’t waste your money. Small to begin with, they would fit a toddler after I washed them. I wear a size 7 shoe and these were miserable to wear ."
2.0,"Zipper is flimsy and broke right off in less than a month. For the price, I’d expect better quality."
2.0,The material is a true denim so it doesn’t conform to your body at all and doesn’t wear comfortably
2.0,I wasn’t expecting it to be the highest quality but... I did expect the seams to be sewn! I discovered a large hole under the left arm. So disappointing!
2.0,Plain and ugly
2.0,"Not as pictured. I thought it was going to be vintage like, it just looks like a regular cover. Not different than another you could find anywhere. If you want something unique look elsewhere."
2.0,"These are cute, but run very small.  Ordered a 2x and it fits like a small/ medium.  Would not buy again."
2.0,I bought medium thinking they were sized for women but they were lose and sloppy.
2.0,"You may as well just roll them down and add another roll to the tummy..<br />I think they maybe a nice panty, but they just roll down to the lowest part of your waist as soon as you put them on"
2.0,"This is not a caplet or a shrug, it is a chiffon borelo. I order this item believe it to be a caplet and was surprised it was not. It will serve a purpose for something but if you are looking for a caplet, I suggest looking else where."
2.0,"Not a big fan of these leggings. The stitch work was done poorly. If you take a look at the pictures I have uploaded you can see where on the back seam the material must not have been laying flat when they were sewn together; part of the material is folded and sewn in where it shouldn't be. These are also very see-through. In my last picture, you can clearly see my underwear. I don't like when leggings are not fitted throughout and these are loose down around the ankles. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,The press on graphic is badly done. I kept it to wear around the house because the fabric is soft.
2.0,"I ended up returning this item.  I have a short torso, and the formed boobs of the bodice were nearly at my chin."
2.0,This dress is about 1/2 the size of an adult dress.....maybe some people like it that way....i did not!
2.0,worked great but were very long and came out of my nose very easily so it didnt take long before they got lost
2.0,Hard to remove cards in and out.
2.0,These shoe clips are not attractive; they look cheap. I tried them on a few pair of shoes and was disappointed with the way they look. This purchase was a waste of my time and money.
2.0,"The second I took it out and tried to put it in shorts for my Halloween costume, the pin part snapped off. I was able to fix it somewhat but it just kept happening"
2.0,"Not a good onsie for babies, the letters peel off easily, I pefer screen printed Tees. Size purchased was 6-12 months, my grandson is 7 months old and it was too small."
2.0,I got pink and it was see through the style of its cute the material not so much.
2.0,"You get only 1 Keychain in this purchase and even then, you don't get to choose which one you want. I ordered 4 and got 3 of the same type. Not worth it. Unless you're just buying 1."
2.0,"I sent it back because the fabric has a Lycra feel, there is a lot of pink in the gray plaid, and the fit was strange."
2.0,"This polo looks great.  Note, it is hand wash only.  Will not hold up to machine washing.  Mine has a loose thread that unraveled and ruined shirt."
2.0,Very cheap looking and feeling. Not what expected.
2.0,Didn't like the material - shoulders narrow.
2.0,I didnt care for the fit of this shirt I plan to return
2.0,"Not solid color, looks faded blue, like its been washed 20 times. It's loud & crinkly, I tried it on for 6 seconds & couldn't stand how loud it was.The worst part is the hood, if you look at the 2nd to last picture of the back of the collar, that is where the hood is rolled up. Its held in place with velcro. So if you use the hood the collar automatically pops up ( your neck then popped up collar then hood). If you want it hidden, then you roll it up under the collar like a weird huge tie on your neck.  I'm bummed because I choose this jacket over another one that was $2 cheaper & now the price of the other jacket has gone up $15 in 2 days. Plus XXL is small. Sending this back."
2.0,The shoe wasn't true to size and gapped in odd places. I wear Sperry Top Siders all the time so I guess this was just an odd pair
2.0,I like them but one arrived defective. I cannot close the pink one because one of the ends its defective. Could you please replace it
2.0,"Update: lost 2 stones, purchased November 17. Sent it back.<br /><br />Lost a stone a week in. Thought it was good before that. Still looks real. Get compliments all the time."
2.0,"Loved the glasses at first, purchased for vacation in July. By the end of September, lenses seem to peel around the edges. I did write the seller in October. I’ve waited 4 days and haven’t heard back. Hopefully there is some type of warranty."
2.0,I didn’t like how this fit so I returned it.
2.0,"Cheap, Zipper is very cheap and got stuck. Selling it at my garage sale."
2.0,Bought better bags for less from Whole Foods. Returned these as soon as I opened them and saw them.
2.0,"The top of the shoe is too wide for the bottom.i know it doesn't matter about the pronation of my foot.Very uncomfortable to wear and I feel that these shoes could actually be dangerous in certain situations.The sole is way too narrow.I would send them back,but,I have worn them for three nights while I am away from home.Sometimes it is better to spend  more for better comfort,wear and safety."
2.0,I wish I would have gotten a smaller size. It was defently way to big to wear.
2.0,"This luggage looks like hard shell, but it is cheap plastic.  I could not get the locks to change from 0-0-0.  If you need this for a trip or two, this will do the job, but it is too cheap to be a long term durable product."
2.0,"Usually when a garment is listed as ""one size"", it means that there is enough room in a garment that it fits most people.  I am a true size 12, and usually I can fit into anything that is ""one size"" .<br /><br />What I got when I ordered JSK's Women's Boho Harem Yoga Pants was something that was a pair of trousers that were made of beautiful 100% rayon, soft, lovely fabric witha great design that would have been great to wear anywhere.. However, there is no way at all that these have a 35"" waist. None. These pants were made for someone who is very petite - as in a size 4 -6.<br /><br />I"
2.0,Not a fan of this. it didn't look good or fit right. will be returning.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
2.0,The nose grip is VERY uncomfortable. Difficult to recommend. Shipped fast product as pictured just does not work for me.
2.0,These did not stay on my feet. I tried wearing them with different types of shoes with no luck. I did like how they felt on but the sliding off was annoying. I have wide feet so they may fit someone with average or slim feet. The quality of the product is good.
2.0,the belt fibers started coming loose after six or seven months.
2.0,The dress was great but the leather arm part was really small.  I had to return.
2.0,My niece had to return it as it ran small.
2.0,Sizing is way off. I used chart and it doesn't fit.
2.0,Not actually a beach throw type mayerial. The tassels are flimsy. Would be better if marketed a tapestry
2.0,Ordered a size 5-6 t<br />Runs extremely small and there was no size indicated on the clothing.
2.0,I like the length if the socks as the came over the calf.  There was little to no compression in the foot and ankle area.  Not what I was looking for so I returned them.
2.0,it is only for winter. it is rather warm
2.0,This hat is made for children or an adult with a child's size head!!!
2.0,it works but poor quality
2.0,"Nice enough hat, but much to big for my smaller featured oval face.  I purchased these to keep the sun off my neck, shoulders. Just didn't suit me."
2.0,"Quality seems ok, but these should state for children as I'm not obese by any means and this strap fits on literally only the last setting (not really the look, feel I was going for)."
2.0,Didn't like how the straps go around your arms.  It was uncomfortable. But nice quality material.
2.0,"Stiff, and they smell terrible."
2.0,Change zipper broke. Disappointed.
2.0,It's ok not thick as I thought!
2.0,The picture on the website is different than what I got the ones on the website have white threading going through and it's kind of shiny and that's what I liked about it when I got them it looks like the threading is gray and just looks like another pair of black boots nothing special about them so I'm going to return them
2.0,It fits very nice. The color changes after one wash.
2.0,"The reflective lenses cause you to see your own eye when getting to wear these. Also, because the arms and frames are yellow near your peripherals the sun highlights them constantly and it's incredibly distracting."
2.0,"Way to small, better size up a couple sizes for this to fit."
2.0,Not the best quality. Mine tarnished in my ear and it got infected
2.0,I do not like the fit... it is not flowy at all it is very  stiff no movement as you see in the image.
2.0,Not as pictured. It is knee length and has no shape.
2.0,too heave. but beautiful color so I still keep it. but hope it should be lighter.
2.0,I did not find these very attractive or well made.
2.0,"I'm not sure why this belt gets such high rating. Immediately upon opening it I could feel the cheap quality of its materials and construction. It's like the freebie belts you get sometimes with a pair of shorts. And, unlike most belts, you have to take it off to make small adjustments in the sizing.<br /><br />It also snags easily & is difficult to thread through some standard-size belt loops.<br /><br />For $30 you can do a lot better-- and I suggest that you do!"
2.0,"Rusted, the stone isn’t clear, definitely NOT sterling silver. Clasp broke on me within a month."
2.0,"They run small. I purchased a 4t for my average size twins who just turned 3 and they fit snug, with not a ton of stretch. They fit about as well as the 2t I'm replacing. Also, the lace design is pretty scratchy, I could imagine it irritating sensitive skin. Especially it being snug and not as stretchy. It did not bother my girls, however.<br /><br />In the picture I have different brands to compare: Cartoon ones are 3t, Stripe ones are 4t (this company), blue ones are 4t/5t Fruit of the Loom, and pink ones are 4 Cat & Jack (runs huuuuge)<br /><br />The second picture compares the stretch of the smaller 3t with the stripe 4t. While the 3t is about 1/2 inch smaller, it stretches almost 1/2 inch further then the stripe. (Making the 3t more comfortable to wear)"
2.0,I loved the high quality of the gloves and how they fit my hands
2.0,I like the colors but I think it need to be a little bit more breathable and the neck line needs to be more stretchy
2.0,Elastic became all wavy when not on my wrist and was problematic with my nightstand charger.
2.0,Nice gloves but they advertise falsely as touch screen / texting gloves. They don't work at all on your phone. I had to continuously remove my gloves in frigid weather to take pics with my phone which is why I purchased these gloves to attempt to avoid my hands being cold as well as the gloves holding up. The knit kind in other stores that advertise you screen gloves work well but unravel after extended use. These simply look good but have little functionality when operating your phone or other touchscreen device
2.0,"I bought these leggings for running and lounging. First of all, the sizing is way off. I'm about 5'6"" and 125 lbs, small waist but wide hips. I sized down based on reviews on Amazon and on YouTube and bought an XS. Out of the package, these leggings looked TINY - like for kids. But they stretched out a lot and now fit me fine. They make your butt look great, but good god, are they ITCHY!!!! I would not buy again, and I hardly wear them after a month. Overall, they look good, but they're not comfortable. Especially itchy if sitting down with the fabric pressing into my skin."
2.0,very cheap looking. but i guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"the appearance of the bracelet I love it, but when I got it, the bracelet was too small, I have very petite wrists and it didn't even fit and shortly after I bought it it started falling apart."
2.0,Its cheaply made the flowers are an iron on piece that looks like it will fall off easily.luckily its just a dress for pictures.woukd not stand up to normal wear for a three year old
2.0,Cheap material a few bends and it leaves crease's all over. You get what you pay I guess I recommend getting a size bigger because the shoe runs small
2.0,I am 5 ft high with  somewhat full legs.  I need the socks for lymphedema.  I bought a pair in medium size previously but was unable to wear because they were too tight at the top. This time I bought extra large because it was saying it was large in US. The stockings ended up too long for my legs that are as short as I am and still somewhat too tight at the top because I have to turn them down.  I wish I could return at least the pair that I did not open yet. They may be good for a slender tall person but they are not one size fits all.
2.0,I only wore it a few times and the faux leather is already getting torn up where the buckle sits.
2.0,"Size is fine, but you can see through the fabric.<br />Now only using as pajamas."
2.0,"I loved the way this dress fit when it came out of the bag. It was at my knees, which made it modest enough to wear to work. Then I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat. Now it's a mini-dress, and I can't wear it anywhere."
2.0,Runs small.  Color is more mottled that photo shows.  Fabric is very soft but looks like it would pill very easily.  Returned.
2.0,The Large fits my daughter who normally wears Small.
2.0,It was a very light piece of tin that made a clink kind of noise with every step i took. Felt and looked very cheap.
2.0,Didn’t like how it laid personally. I think if I’d reorder that I’d go down a size.<br />Cute dress!
2.0,"La tela es como sintética y no de algodón por lo que no me gustó, aparte de que la talla queda muy justa"
2.0,they were to big
2.0,nowhere does anyone show how to adjust the band (bracelet) Please send me instructions on how to adjust the band.
2.0,I dont like how the pants hang around my ankles. They are nice enough just not for me.
2.0,These are supposed to be replicas of Gucci but unfortunately they don’t copy Gucci exactly and the frames are way too big.
2.0,"Beautiful rings and easy to apply however, the base of the bar is way thin and cuts into my lip so I can't wear these."
2.0,"Beautiful suit, but the cups are tiny.  Also, there are inserts that slip, slide and fold in the cup area.  However, my biggest concern is that my ""girls"" kept slipping out of the top!!  Absolutely no support under them or around the body of the suit."
2.0,The plastic clasp in the back is not a good design feature. The fit was small and the overall effect was that's cheap looking.
2.0,All the zippers broke and I only used it for a month. Looks good but not made real well.
2.0,"This dress fit horribly. The top, the mid section.. it all ran very small. Does not hide imperfections well."
2.0,"I loved the nightgown. Albeit a bit then it was soft, comfortable and just the right length. My issue was that it did not wash well. If it weren’t for that I would buy more of them."
2.0,Shrunk a lot
2.0,"Not true to size definitely size up, bought this for my granddaughter went by the sizing chart and the actual body of it was so small that if she sat down I’m sure she would’ve ripped the whole shorts out from the underneath the dress itself was roomy but not the under piece that is the shorts that are built in all the way up so it looked cute definitely size up"
2.0,Not what I expected at all. Thought it would be a stretchy work out set but more like a pajama set. The pants are too big but the shirt fits. Material is a soft cotton
2.0,"Not what I expected.  Bought these because of the cute frenchies.  Pants fit fine, but they aren’t super stretchy.  The top, barely fit, and it was because I have a bigger chest. As far as comfy, I honestly have bought super soft and comfy pajamas at Walmart that were 5 times better than these :/<br /><br />Oh, I also wear a size 16 women’s, ordered XL (16/18) and definitely wasn’t expecting the top to be this snug"
2.0,Material was very thin and see-thru. Will be returning.
2.0,Looks better in the photo
2.0,Should be more clear that only 1 earring comes
2.0,"Negatives: I was mostly looking for something to provide a little padding in the crotch area when I ride my unicycle so that I can increase my distance.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice any difference in pressure when I was wearing this underwear compared to just plain old briefs.  The underpants did, however, create more chaffing than I was used to, actually making me worse off than before.  That would probably be different for everyone though.<br /><br />Positives: The fit was good.  For reference, I ordered a medium for my 5'4"" / 125 lb. self.  Although still nearly new, they appear to be well-stitched, and I believe they will hold up well to wear."
2.0,"Fits small, if you’re in doubt size up. Nice jacket, good with rain and water, stitching already coming apart less than a month of wearing."
2.0,I went by the size guidelines and I could barely squeeze in...
2.0,"Looked very cheap in person, and unflatteringly baggy. It looks much more polyester/shiny in person than the nice muted almost rustic looking fabric in the photo."
2.0,"Positives: lightweight, soft, flexible, no odor.<br />Negatives: Hot, hot, hot!  I bought it specifically because it's supposed to be cooling and all I've done is sweat wearing it.  Very disappointed!"
2.0,Its almost impossible to detach the legs...
2.0,It was supposed to be rose gold. Color came put to he gold no rose tint at all
2.0,"Cute pattern, but I returned it. I'm a size 2 and it just felt too big on me"
2.0,"I'm 5'4 and 124lbs and I got the smallest size -- The dress was pretty, but really loose and looked kind of dumpy on me. It was also still too long even with heels."
2.0,"Very cheap feel ,fits small for size."
2.0,Fit very tight. Need these in sizes or to be adjustable. Not usable for a 7 1/4 hat size head.
2.0,Not good quality.  Took them on a 7-day trip where they were packed and unpacked a total of four times.  The color has already faded in places.
2.0,"No stamping as shown, to prove its stainless steel. The &#34;gold plating&#34; looks more like costume jewelry purchased out of a quarter machine. I'm very disappointed in this ring."
2.0,Dress was very large through the chest but I was unable to get it fully zipped. I am typically a size 16 but went up a size even. Also dress was extremely long.
2.0,"The only way you'll fit these is if you are a size 0.  I normally get a size large in any of the leggings and they fit perfectly, however the large in these would not cover my behind.  I got an x-large and I had the same problem."
2.0,El delantal es muy transparente entiendo q el precio es bajo pero había comprado baratos y la tela era mucho mejor . Pero estos son muy baja calidad
2.0,"I am not sure if it is the material or the copper inside the mask, but I cannot wear this mask for any long period of time as it is hard to breathe, I feel like I ran three miles when I remove it because I am out of breath once I take it off. It also arrived a week late after saying it was delivered a week earlier. My apologies but I would not recommend this mask."
2.0,"The mask is very high quality and looks great. However, the mask is to tight on the face regardless of loosening the straps that it's pressed up against my eyes to where I can't even open them. Had to put extra padding in to make it sit away from my face. Mask is a little big as well for a female"
2.0,"I just got this and it has nothing that's on the picture even the hello kitty is different. there was only 1 hello kitty head made of clear plastic mostly huge glitter stars and half yellow bows, bats, and Pikachu, flowers and bees. different color girls. I wish I would have gotten something different. maybe I can use them for something different later."
2.0,"They work, but are not as soft on the inside, which is what is on my hair. That was disappointing. Otherwise they’re great."
2.0,"First of all, the most important function of the bag, the closure and protection of the items within, fails miserably. I only keep a small wallet and keys and a lipgloss and the button never stays closed. It’s always falling open in public, and my wallet is constantly falling on the ground. I have lost it in this manner multiple times. I am constantly keeping my hand on the flap to keep it closed. The multicolor reflection is lovely and if the design was different I might enjoy it, but this is a huge NO. I am giving it two stars simply because I like the appearance, but despise the functionality. Do not buy this version!"
2.0,Over all very comfortable pants 👖
2.0,Sleeves are tight and the back is to short.
2.0,"The silicone part is breaking so easy  , and glasses  fall  down"
2.0,I dont like how the color came off so easy...its painted black...get the silver one you wont notice the color as much...just know its not solid black.
2.0,hugeee!!
2.0,Does not brighten night time driving although they do reduce the glare of headlights from oncoming traffic somewhat. Don't highly recommend this product. There are less expensive products that produce the same effect.
2.0,"It looks like a sleep shirt on. I'm 5,8 160lbs B cup, and I got a medium and it was still too large. Has potential for the right person, just not me."
2.0,"runs small; very thin and cheaply made. Most importantly, when I ordered it on prime, the next day the shipping changed from 2 days to 2 months and I couldn't cancel the order. Very annoying."
2.0,"Item is not very well made. It's in my hand for 3 minutes and the valve is already half falling out. Also, not very breathable at all. Glasses still fog up."
2.0,Cheap. returned these
2.0,"After reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes up and the fit was OK.  The blue color though, is darker than depicted and the fabric is like canvas.  Also, the embroidery around the skirt bottom ends in the FRONT and there was a noticeable 3 or 4 inch space with no embroidery at all where the seam comes together.  With the apron over it, it would be ok, unless the wind blew.  I might have kept it even with these faults, but the fabric in the blouse and the apron is a heavy, scratchy, wrinkly cotton.  I could not tolerate it for a few minutes let alone for an entire Oktoberfest.  Sorry."
2.0,"I know some people like this but I am not a fan. It gave me the WEIRDEST shape and it felt like it way too big even though I ordered the smallest size (I'm a large A/small B). Maybe these are better for women with bigger chests or a rounder shape? I have other ""sticky bra"" products and they all have carrying cases that help them keep their shape. But this just has a bag which does nothing to keep it from getting folded, stuck together, etc.<br />The stickiness seemed good, hence the second star. Although since I wouldn't dream of leaving my house in these, I have no idea how they would stick over a long period of time."
2.0,Too large for the wrist
2.0,It’s alright. I had fun scaring my one year-old with that but the problem was I couldn’t breath when I wore it.
2.0,Horrible material. Bought 2 and threw them away.
2.0,Wear out super fast. The seams are already starting to tear apart and I’ve only had them since March.
2.0,These pants are quite thin and the sort of slinky material one expects to find in PJs.  They are also extremely long and so stretchy they don't stay up.  Care is very fussy--hand wash drip dry.  I ran them through the washer and dryer to shrink the length and size in general.  The best thing I can say about them is the color is pretty.  I will wear them around the house.  Would not buy again.
2.0,"It's okay.  Crochet top is nice, but very see-through."
2.0,Cute Disney but very thin material
2.0,"Fabric advertised on website and label as 95% rayon and 5% spandex. However, the fabric is definitely made of polyester, and it pills and loses color after one wash. I bought three dresses from this brand. Two of them had the same issue. They were the ones with patterns. Only the solid color one is as advertised on the site and the label (95% rayon and 5% spandex)."
2.0,Good idea but not for people who actively move around
2.0,very thing
2.0,"The clasps are really cheap and break off EXTREMELY easily. But, now that I have it, it'll be fun to make an art project with. It sucks as a bracelet, but can be good to use as a necklace or something like that."
2.0,It looked cute but the material was a little cheap
2.0,The shirt is comfy however the color was barely even there! It was such a light pink I would call it a beige pink. And I was mistakenly under the impression the pockets were in front not on the side
2.0,"I was disappointed in the size.  For unisex, I would have expected a larger XL.  The foot heal just bearly fit my size 10 women's feet.  They also were not long enough and way too tight- I usually wear stocking meant to fit a length of 19 inches and a calf of around 18-20.  They left indents from the fabric seams.  The different colors are not of a continuous piece of fabric.  Each color in the pattern is a separate piece of fabric connected together. They left quite a pattern on my skin!  I wear compression socks to prevent blood clots and lower leg swelling.  I don't think these were really medical grade.  :( Too bad as they were super cute and the outsides feel fantastic."
2.0,Cheap/small
2.0,"Looks nothing like the picture, more like a weird lacy ring around your neck than an actual collar.<br />Returning."
2.0,Too wide.
2.0,"This gown was too large for me, I have to return it"
2.0,The rings were pretty but after wearing them a couple times (2-3 uses) they turned green.
2.0,"Make sure you get the right size for this thermal set. I am 5'5 and 200 lbs. and I ordered a large size couldn't even get the shirt to go on. I really liked the material of this set, but couldn't get it to fit."
2.0,"Nice color,falls of my shoulder."
2.0,I forgot to take pictures and I'm sad since I was so busy w/my birthday. But I am on the bigger side and I weigh about 200 Ibs. I thought that this would make a good fit but I was wrong. The sash somewhat fit me but at the top it was poking out (hopefully that makes sense). When I tried to clip the bottoms together they were a bit short so therefore didn't sit on my shoulder correctly. If I would have known that this was not for big girls I would have returned it and bought something else. What a waste of money!
2.0,"If you have very heavy breasts do not buy this. It fits just ok, but i do not feel confident in it."
2.0,Fake stone
2.0,Found a ripped seam on the day I was wearing it.
2.0,I thought this wallet was a lot smaller. Barely fits in my back pocket.
2.0,"I expected it to be small, so I ordered XL (when I usually take L or M), and it's still a little too snug.  My chief complaint, however, is the zipper: flimsy material (maybe aluminum?) so teeth are already bent after only a couple of wearings; and zipper incorrectly sewn in--when the teeth to the zipper mesh correctly, the two sides of  the sweater don't quite line up, so it is impossible to get the front to lie flat.  Also, peculiarly, the zipper is installed backward; when it is open, the pull to the zipper is on the left side, and the right side fits into it--as though it were a lady's garment.  Not a big deal--you can't tell when it's zipped; but confusing if you're used to dressing yourself with the zipper the other way."
2.0,"I ordered this for my daughter as a Christmas gift because I thought it would be perfect for a young girl. As soon as I opened the box and took the sweatshirt out I could tell that this was not what I had pictured. The image makes the top look thick and fits the model perfectly- this is not the case. The fabric is extremely thin and scratchy, she said it is not comfy to wear.  After reading reviews that it came too small, I ordered a large for my 19 year old 120 pound daughter and it still did not fit right. The design is cute on the front, but the quality is just not worth the price. It is also not suitable for larger chested females, my other daughter tried it on and it just did not fit right on her body. The design and idea is good, but the quality of the fabric is just not the best."
2.0,These fell apart the first day worn
2.0,The necklace is very cheap. The ring is well made but who ever that puts BTS debut date on the rings needs to put the correct date. It's actually 6-13-2013 NOT 6-12-2013. Got this for my 14 years old daughter and she noticed right off the bat the date is wrong. The Q&A is misleading also. Some answers says the 13 and some says the 12. I didn't know which date is actually on it till it arrived. Please have this corrected. I'm keeping it cause it's cute.
2.0,"Received product looked awesome, but has a strong smell and washed Jean's 4 times and still cant get the smell out. I haven't worn the jeans because of the smell."
2.0,Nice cords. I wish they were a little thicker.
2.0,This would go perfect with my Michael Myers mask. I just hate how long the pants are.
2.0,"The outfit arrived and is wearable (no holes, etc). However, the fit is extremely odd. The one I received, the onesie was incredibly wide and short. The waist of the pants was too big and the pants didn't fit the way they were designed to. The seams don't match up, so you have red pattern abruptly turning into green pattern at the seam. The material is also super thin and slightly see through. I really wanted to like this outfit, but it's just so cheaply made I don't think I'll be putting it on my daughter a second time."
2.0,"Eh, too tight. Made me look like a little blue sausage. Not loose and swing dress like which admittedly could be on me not the dress."
2.0,one of the belts on the side broke off already<br />not worth the money
2.0,it this are supposed to fit up to a size 12-- it must be in the Barbie collection-- going back
2.0,Appearance is worse than gunmetal & stones have no shine to them
2.0,Looks great but fabric is stiff and wrinkles! I returned it.
2.0,Was not a fan. Material is awful.
2.0,"Cross came off of heart after 4 days, replaced and same thing happened"
2.0,"The dress runs big. I wish I would have ordered a size down. The material is thin and is see through. Those were my biggest complaints, other than those two things, the dress was ok!"
2.0,"This was a great price, but I had to cut the seam in the back as it would have been too small for a child. It was so tight I couldn't breathe. I had to cut eye holes because I couldn't see out and it was so tight it hurt my eyes and lashes. Otherwse, the quality and the look was good, but hard to wear without modifications."
2.0,I have bought betting sweaters before.  I would not wa are my time on this.
2.0,This skirt should cost $10! The fabric is cheap feeling & tissue paper thin! I could've bought a large instead x-large.  I kept it b/c I didn't want the headache of returning it.
2.0,The charger didn't Work... One shoe had more variety of light colors than the other
2.0,I could get them on but they kept falling off.  Guess they were not the right size.
2.0,"if you have a butt I don't recommend this, squeezes you in the wrong way"
2.0,Could have been GORGEOUS but all are so thin that they bent during shipping. No way to flatten them perfectly. Also there was a big ole nasty black hair in the bag as well...gross!!!!!
2.0,"The package came incomplete.  It was missing an item, and the bow tie was broken. The hats really hard to form. It's very flimsy material, so it won't hold shape."
2.0,Dress is not true to size. XL fits like a small.
2.0,"They did arrive earlier then stated, I was very happy about that. However within on hour of putting 3 in, they broke! Three of them literally just broke in half in my ear. I was very upset! Will not buy again."
2.0,"The awesome rainbow finish rubbed off very quickly, any smudges show up very easily as well."
2.0,"5'7, 32C, 121 pounds. I ordered a small: the bust is too large and the actual dress doesn't match the picture."
2.0,The chain faded to a copper color after wearing it once. The earrings are cute the pendant on the chain is nice but the chain was not good
2.0,"OK for a purse or basic protection, but softer than I'd like. I store sports shades in my gear bag, so should've gotten something sturdier!"
2.0,"it arrived on time, but it is not how it looks on the screen, also it was too tight when you put it in your arm"
2.0,It states navy blue/dark blue and mine came as a turquoise blue.
2.0,Wife dis not like
2.0,This bracelet was not as I expected. It had a mildew smell I'm hoping will go away or I will not be able to wear it.
2.0,They’re OK. They worked for the day of my wedding and that was it. Don’t expect them to last longer than &#60;24 hours.
2.0,Bunches funny in the breast area...
2.0,"My daughter ordered this because she needed a purple dress for an event. When she received it, it was the Wine Red color, which was also cheaper than the purple one. She loved the fit, but was very disappointed that the color was wrong."
2.0,"such a plain sweater, doesn't look like the pic. Returning it."
2.0,Broke after a few weeks. The butterflies must of flown away. The second pair did the same.
2.0,I probably would have loved it… wish they had sent the correct bands
2.0,very small and broke after 3 wearings...
2.0,"Is for a kid, really small and has no stretch, fabric is itchy"
2.0,"They look great, but way too tight for my 13 year old grandson. And he’s a pretty slim boy."
2.0,This dress is too short for me.
2.0,Poor Quality and not much space
2.0,"they were too big for my head, just fell off. But they are a very soft material.  If I had a bigger noggin I'd probably like them."
2.0,"This is a very thin sweater and not soft like most merino wool. Based on other reviews, I will definitely hand wash this item. The fit is tighter than expected, so if you like a looser fit, size up on it."
2.0,"The line of the dress is ruined by the pockets, otherwise it would have been perfect.  Sadly, I had to return."
2.0,Size chart is off
2.0,"While this bracelet is beautiful, it arrived with a broken clasp. I returned it."
2.0,"The ""white"" dress is not white. It is a cream color.  That's too bad because it is a really cute wrap sweater dress.  Unfortunately, I need white, so I will return the dress."
2.0,"After a few washes, thr fabric felt dry rotted."
2.0,I have only worn this once so far to do a zumba class and the description said high impact thats why I bought it. I am a 38DDD and it did not hold up to its description. I was bouncing all over the place. Not a good fit for me wish I could send it back!
2.0,"I’m 5’0 and 132 pounds after reading the reviews about the sizing being too small for other customers I decided on a medium. Medium fits me too large. Debating on exchanging it for a small but the sizing is off so it’s hard too be sure a small will fit me. The costume itself is okay. The cape is nice quality, the bodysuit is a fake leather material but isn’t uncomfortable. The belt jewels fell off the moment I touched it. Disappointed tbh"
2.0,I just purchased these in white. I thought these were the same but they were not. Material is thinner. Inner seam had a long string hanging and if I pull it I know it will unravel.
2.0,I liked the quality of this dress.  I ordered a medium for bust size.  I am a 36C.  However the medium was too small in the bust area and I could not Zip the dress.  So I had to rerun it.😞
2.0,"Shirt is gray printed on the outside, white in the inside. 65 cotton/35 poly blend is soft but not breathable. I was expecting a comfy cotton shirt and this isn’t it. Returned."
2.0,The stones were bigger than I expected.
2.0,This is not a typical North Face dry fit shirt. Shame on me for not paying more attention. I didn't like the way the fabric feels.
2.0,"too small across chest. I ordered a size up ,and it was still too tight across the chest. Other than that, nice fabric."
2.0,Broke after only a few times
2.0,There's some adhesive that was used during it's production that keeps smearing on my cards when trying to take them out. Really annoying. Going to end up throwing it away soon. Give it two stars because I'm assuming it's just a manufacturing defect.
2.0,I like the dress but it arrived dirty. :(<br />The fabric is stretchy and thick - feels like good quality.
2.0,"Ordered a XX and it was barely the size of a large.  Otherwise, the jacket was nicely made.  Would have kept it if it hadn't been so small."
2.0,"The dress is cute, but it came with a huge hole in the armpit. You can tell by the hem that its poorly put together and cheaply done."
2.0,Cheap chain. It broke after one wear.
2.0,The bridge is too narrow so the glasses sits higher than they should.
2.0,"Poly-synthetic leather which is cheap to make, but this one has too much of a fake look - almost plastic and rubbery looking. The heart pendant is an alloy metal that's coated. Made for looks, but not to last. It's a cute design, but made too cheaply. With all that, it's not worth price. You can import one for less than half the price, but you have to wait for it.<br /><br />You're limited to 3 sizes. For me, it was either too tight or too loose. It's made for average to small necks."
2.0,I don't really like them for me.
2.0,Runs way too small. I wear 1X so I ordered a 2X and it fit more like a  L. Disappointed because I really liked it.
2.0,"More like a toy than a real hat, looks good, but poorly made and feel like plastic,  but I kept it for fun parties."
2.0,Very pretty. Gave it to my daughter. It fight too tight for me.
2.0,Product doesnt match measurements listed. Its so big the laptop fits inside.
2.0,Good quality but a little too small.
2.0,It started falling off occasionally. Over time it has got much worse. Once or twice a day. I have become an expert at catching my watch as it is falling. Almost lost my watch several times. Am ordering something else today before it is too late.
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture online at all.  Awkward fit. Ok for wearing around the house.
2.0,Really cute - but broke after 2 weeks.
2.0,"Beautiful and comfortable, great size... But it broke less than a week after I started wearing it. Snapped right in half. It wasn't even on tightly."
2.0,"Bought this for a reward to get my stubborn 3.5yr-old to go potty. It worked. However, dress is cheaply made. The arm fabric ripped after two days of wearing it. One wrong tug at a seam and this dress will rip. Paid $40, when it's only worth maybe $15. Thank goodness she's potty trained or this dress would have been a complete waste of money.<br /><br />(She also wears 4T and I bought a 5T dress and it reaches her ankles. I bought it that way on purpose so she could have this dress for a long time; buuuut that won't be needed now with the tears all over the place now.)"
2.0,Ran small. Adidas box was damaged and was held closed with rubberband. Shipping charges and fees the customer eats up even if your unsatisfied and return product.
2.0,The picture and the arrived product is not the same. The fabric is cotton and not as flowy. The bottom is not rounded out. I ordered 2 sizes bigger just to have it more flowy and large but it not as long as I thought it would be.  I'm only 5 ft and ordering a XL should have the dress hit the floor. Also because its cotton I'm sure once I wash and dry it it's going to shrink from the bottom. So it will show more of my ankles.
2.0,"Ordered small, my usual size, and the waist is too tight. I had to order a medium. Manufacturer should make the waist band looser to conform with other sweat pants companies waist size, so as to reduce returns. Looks great on!"
2.0,"Although these claimed to be hypoallergenic My ears swelled up within the day. I am really disappointed. They are pretty, but if you can't wear them what is the point?"
2.0,"No photo size description, covers did not pop out and photos were hard to insert causing scratches to them. Chain immediately was tangled. Nice looking, but not great."
2.0,The material is soft and comfortable with light padding. But the hem is small. I got Medium and I usually wear 36B and it is a bit tight on me. I wonder if Large would be too large since it's not adjustable. I have a feeling my size would be between Medium and a Large.
2.0,Rediculously too small. First this would not be a KLR length on a 5’ y’all woman let alone a 5’10” woman. Secondly according to their sizing crap this should be about a 12-14. One size larger than my wife wears. Rather it is not even remotely big enough for her!  Great Christmas gift if it sucks completely!  Thanks a lot for the woefully inaccurate listings.
2.0,Most 7/8 are alittle big on my daughter but the swim suite seems to run abit small also the gems fell off the first time swimming
2.0,Omg I ordered my regular size which is a large because I am top heavy. Wear a 38C. The entire thing hung on me It was like a 2x. Rather than returning I altered it....the cups are still big and I had to take in about 3 inches to the back seam. And take the crutch up about an inch.  I don’t know if I would even trust a medium at this point.
2.0,Fits tight- order larger when you order
2.0,"The part for the head loosely fits my 10 month, although the brim is huge; this could be a good thing though because it provides shade for the back of the neck. My kiddo wouldn't keep it on though. The string is very long and not break-away, which I don't think is safe for a baby as it is a strangle-hazard. The piece on the string to tighten it to the chin doesn't stay up. I may cut (and shorten) the strings to tie them under his chin, or maybe add velco to velco it under the chin, or I may just remove the string entirely. In conclusion, I would not recommend this product to a friend."
2.0,"Very pretty, but too tight on my head. Could not wear it. Made for small heads or children!"
2.0,I was ordering a man’s wallet. This is definitely a woman’s wallet. As a woman’s wallet I’d give it 4stars
2.0,"The dress is pretty, but even if you get a plus size there isn't enough room in the boobs. The boobs are made for a size medium."
2.0,The products biggest flaw is that it does not have a band elastic enough. The mask does not stay on very well.
2.0,These shirts look and have the fit of a child's size.  I ordered the xl and my 11 year old it fit perfect.
2.0,These are super cute but insanely hard to take out of your nose. I had to cut it with pliers so I ruined the gold hoop. I do not recommend these if you plan on changing your septum ring often.
2.0,Cute but ripped in less than a month.
2.0,It’s really pretty but i think it’s for people with big waists coz i have a small waist and it was too big for me
2.0,Spare watch
2.0,"Face shipment, poor quality."
2.0,Cute but extremely small. I can't wear it.
2.0,"Entirely too tight. Definitely go a size up. I didn’t do that, so I sent back. The last, of course, you like it skin tight."
2.0,"The main pro about these pants is the fabric. It's soft, comfortable and, despite it being 'pre-aged' it remains decently sturdy. The stitching throughout is also well-done.<br /><br />However, the list of cons is a bit longer. The overall sizing is unusual. Only one measurement (waist) is provided which usually means the length is the same. Not in this case -- I received a 34 waist but a 30 length, which is well short of what would fit.<br /><br />Length aside, the overall cut is not to my taste at all. The rise is very short, making these rather uncomfortable to wear. The relaxed fit is mainly in the seat area, and the combination of a short rise and a large seat makes them look ill-fitting (in addition to feeling that way as well).<br /><br />I'll give it 2 stars since the material is nice, but these are not pants I would recommend even if you need 34 waist and 30 length."
2.0,"Very cheaply made, nothing like the photo"
2.0,Very thin fabric. A bit small on arms for my but I'm a taller person .. Wanted to use for cold times in the house but didn't really keep me warm.
2.0,It's a rayon/poly blend so the material is shiny and stretchy like a camisole
2.0,"At first the glasses were great until I wanted to switch out the band for the sunglass arms.  Nothing would stay attached or lock in.  I only had 1 week to use them and after that it was annoying to have the selections and not able to use any of them. I had hope for the price and quality, sorry. no good."
2.0,Sizing of shoe was really off. Too small.
2.0,The ring broke after only wearing it for a few hours. Otherwise I like it.
2.0,I knew the minute I took it out of the bag that it wasn’t what I had thought. I have bought three dresses this summer on Amazon and everyone of them have been perfect fit and great material. Well that has come to an end. Beware it’s not what it says it is.
2.0,This cell phone case/cover isn't horrible but it's made out of cheap material and is not 100% waterproof. Your phone will be f#$%ed if you drop it in a pool. This case is water resistant at best!
2.0,The first pair came with a hole in one.  My replacements ones already have a run in them and strings are coming out.  They certainly aren't any easier to put on or better than any other compression socks I've purchased.  The price point is lower than most and so is the quality.
2.0,I would really like to return this item but for sentiment my husband won't allow it. He won't wear it because of the way it is made and the yucky feel of material.  Read material contents carefully! Look closely at the sleeves and waist!
2.0,"I was going to use this item to protect my hair at night while sleeping. Cap was way to large and did not stay on at night, when i floded the front back it did not look right.I did keep them but would buy again."
2.0,Broke first time wearing.... just broke in half right off my finger
2.0,I love the design and price but the zipper ripped in a week.
2.0,Necklace was so tangled that it broke.
2.0,This watch does look like the picture but the links are plastic....you can see where they break apart from each other from the mold. It's really light and I like weight on my wrist. Itcomes with a little tool to take the links out but the instructions didn't make sense.
2.0,"ordered a small and they are way too large for me. I am 5’4” and 105lbs, a small is my usual size but even an XS thats half an inch shorter would still be wayy too large on me. great material and was exactly what I was looking for, its unfortunate they do not fit."
2.0,"Material too thin, too form fitting."
2.0,The size was a bit small. The XL usually fits me but I guess this material runs small.
2.0,"Looks great, last long ."
2.0,"I purchased these to dry out my work boots during a trip where the area is in its rainy season.  The deodorizing feature does work fairly well, and my boots were completely dry by morning.  However, they only worked the first two nights.  Now, only one of the two inserts function, so I have to switch it during the night.  It's disappointing as I cannot return or exchange them while I'm out here in the middle of nowhere.  If the second unit dies out, I'll just have wet and smelly boots for the next few months."
2.0,"I was going for a nerdy, cute look, definitely didn't go well. They look cheap and they weren't flattering on any of my friends faces."
2.0,Pretty flimsy.  They're ok but not great.
2.0,"The fit is veryt weird. I read the reviews and ordered a size that I thought would be good. I'm large chested (DDD) and the top was still big.  One other thing, the swim suit was very to difficult to put on"
2.0,"beautiful looking case. appears to be good quality but very soon after  purchasing one of watch rotation tables operated intermittently, but by changing the rotation direction the table turned. now the table will not turn in any direction. not wanting to return and being too late to return i wanted to repair it. just try and find a  repair manual or even a point of contact with the manufacturer. recently learned that the motors are cheaply made and have a high failure rate.  hoping Amazon will help me find a repair manual or manufacturer contact."
2.0,Picture looks more green but it's actually more blueish (teal)
2.0,"Somewhat on the small side, fabric is a little itchy and the sleeves are already starting to fray and become unraveled after one wear."
2.0,It look very inexpensive and the fabric is very thin and gets hot really easily.
2.0,First the top I received was obviously used. The burgundy was very pretty but this top is not off the shoulder. It doesn't stretch at all to be pulled down the arm. The material was somewhat cheesy.
2.0,Fit is as expected for a men’s large and the shirt feels good quality but the product photo is very misleading. The printed design is laughably tiny compared to what is depicted. Pretty disappointed and will be returning.
2.0,Not worth the purchase. My daughter wore the rings a few hours and it looked like it was cutting off the circulation. Her fingers were stained for days
2.0,Cute but lot smaller than imagined
2.0,It was too small even though I got a size bigger than I needed.
2.0,"Did like how it fit or the material, I returned it."
2.0,The band frayed within a week or two.
2.0,Too small and TRANSPARENT.
2.0,So super see through!  And shinny.  My pair had darker lines I tried to show in the picture also-defect in the pants.  But I just threw them on to run to the store so I can’t return.  But I can’t stress this enough-totally see through!!! Last I tire I tried to hold up to window w one hand while taking a picture-they were not stretched out at all and you can see the sun-would not but again.
2.0,"Cute, but the eyes are so far apart I cant see out of it, therefore can't really wear it (safely) anywhere"
2.0,Cheap looking but still pretty diamond was falling out already
2.0,"For the price, not good quality. I got a better quality coat at Ross for only $15. This jacket is thin, like a spring jacket. NOT A COAT, NOT ""PUFFER"", THIS HAS HARDLY ANY FILLING!"
2.0,I’m usually a huge fan of this brand ! However this dress was very thin and see through! Love the style may try different color !
2.0,The pants fits good but the top is very short like a crop top
2.0,"First impression when you open it, is that it looks great! Printing is beautiful! But as you can see in my photo, that doesn't last long.<br /><br />If you have adult-thickness legs, these socks will be tight and uncomfortable to pull on. As you pull them on, they will stretch, and the image will no longer be the clear, beautiful picture it was moments before.<br /><br />The stretch also stays after you take them off. You can actually tell which side was facing up when you wore them, because that's the side the stretch will be on."
2.0,"I like the concept, if they are all working.  11 out of 40 lights weren't working."
2.0,My waist size is 24 inch.<br />But X-Small is too big.<br />Waist band is nessasry but I don't pants like this weird size
2.0,Is much smaller and more delicate that I expected
2.0,"I loved the idea of this hat and still do, but the bluetooth on it can be extremely spotty!! I will have my phone in my pocket and the hat on my head and it just randomly disconnects. I bought this hat for winter running and it totally sucks when I'm in the middle of a workout and lose connectivity. The sound quality is also just OK, it's definitely on the lower end of quality, but what can you expect for $20, I guess?"
2.0,i ordered it in an xlarge for my son but it fit like a medium. the graphix and colors were gorgeous
2.0,But it’s not the colors as advertised. It’s red shades. Not pink.
2.0,I received this handbag as a Christmas gift. Loved the design even if it looked like faux leather.  I have used  it frequently but not permanently. Now the handles are torn appart and they do not look like real leather. Poor quality.
2.0,Cheap and mine broke after 3 times wearing it. But I did get it caught on my purse once that contributed to that.
2.0,The socks are too thick to fit in my shoes.
2.0,The shirt was a bit heavy and itchy. It returned it.
2.0,The valves for the mask snap come undone too easily. I made sure they were in right before the gym but bumped one halfway through and it came apart.
2.0,"I ordered the Red Rubber Sole's for my Christian Louboutin espadrille's.  The item came in the mail a few days later when I went to the cobbler to have them put on I only had 1 sole.  They are not sold as a pair?  Furthermore,  the red was not a bright red it was more like a brick red color.  The color was no big deal .  I was bothered more that they only sold (1 sole) in a package.  Therefore, I returned it because I can't use one sole."
2.0,"Way too small. I am 124#/5'3"". and a medium should have fit, No give to the material."
2.0,Not as nice as I would have liked for the price . Plus it is also very small
2.0,"Honestly all this really does is smear a greasy film on my lenses. It’s soft and evenly distributed the greasy film, but it’s not transparent."
2.0,"These have a very fake gold look. They fit but you can see the seem on the bracelet, they are flimsy and just don't look great.  If you are looking for an over the top jewelry for a costume you could go with this but otherwise, skip it."
2.0,Not a great shape for me.
2.0,To short.  I will have granny bring it up to under my knee. Just isn't flattering above the ankle. Disappointed. It was hit or miss from the other reviews.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this shirt. Unfortunately, the picture is so pixelated, it almost hurts to look at it. From really far away, you can kind of tell who it's meant to be. It's just so unfortunate"
2.0,"The band was too big for my head and because you cannot adjust these, I had to send them back. Also, the fur is not as full as what you see in the picture (kind of flat looking)."
2.0,Would have been ok if it would have fit
2.0,"These were too large and stretchy. Also, I ordered black (even said on package) but a jean color appeared. They were almost a metallic jean material and looks very cheap and not like jeans or black pants at all. Save your money and just wear yoga pants."
2.0,The keychain itself is super cute and matches my baby blue purse perfectly. The only downside is that the clasp that is shown in the product pictures is different than the one on the item I received. Unfortunately the clasp is too small to fit on my purse strap making it unusable.
2.0,Material not sturdy<br />Holds fingerprints
2.0,The dress is nice but runs too small.  Gave it away.
2.0,"I wish I went a size down, these pants are an interesting fit.. not a fan though"
2.0,I wear a size 11 shoe and this seems to be for a size 2-7
2.0,It's really thin and tags showed lower price but my daughter already ripped tags and packaging away so I kept. Not really impressed with this one.shipping was quick though.
2.0,Smaller then shown in the picture
2.0,Gives off a lot of white dust and doesn't polish effectively. I won't be buying this again.
2.0,"My previous Taxi Wallet was brown, but was of a much better quality leather.  Also, the flap where credit cards and/or ID cards go will only let you put in just 2 or 3, or else the snap on the flap will not reach to snap it securely closed.  If you have a Driver license, a Concealed carry card, and two Insurance ID cards, you will be lucky to get those in and still snap it closed.  The only place left for cards is to tuck them into the middle of the folded wallet, where the ends of the remaining cards are exposed.  This wallet does not look like it will last nearly as long as the last one I had.  The design is good, but the leather may or may not hold up, and the wallet seems skimpy compared to my other one - I got all my cards into the other one.  Will not be purchasing again unless the &quot;snap closed&quot; compartment is redesigned."
2.0,"I normally wear a size 14/16 in pants, and I generally carry my weight in my stomach (so, not much junk in the trunk).  While these generally look and fit great, if I bend over in these, my underwear are *thoroughly* visible -- which is fine if you're wearing them as tights, but terrible for stand-alone leggings.  I will be returning them."
2.0,Wayyyyy to big! Tool wayyyyy to long shorts not to short or to high.. I ordered a medium but it's more like a large! I have it two stars because it is as described
2.0,"It looks cheap, the material is cracking and the color is wearing off 4 months after purchasing. My last leather belt lasted 5-10 years. I hoped to find a good replacement for that belt and this is not it."
2.0,It doesn't show it has a clasp instead of slipping it on u need help to hook it.
2.0,The pins i received did not have the clips. I'm attempting to return them.
2.0,Belt started to stretch from the first day. Poor quality
2.0,2x fits like a 1x. Fraying in the seams everywhere. Ok for the price but I recommend knowing how to stitch. The color and fabric were nice and match picture.
2.0,"Wasn't very please with the dress, the elastic sits way too high."
2.0,We liked the umbrella but the clip broke within the first year and made it almost impossible to use..the wind also catches and blows it around quite a bit
2.0,its cute. In the the color in the photo is like pink but honestly is like red or almost orange. the color doesnt bother me but I prefer pink. the cloth is low quality.
2.0,Does not work.  Just a tight shirt is all this is.  Don't waste your $ on this.
2.0,Was a great idea but broke with in an hour of my son having the tried super gluing then the other side broke very disappointed cuz he t really liked them
2.0,The rubberized ear stem portion of the glasses came off while playing golf and was lost after 3 rounds. not very well put together.
2.0,"I liked the suit overall, but the upper portion was huge on me. I attempted to remove the padding to see if that would help, but it just didn't look right."
2.0,Wore it 3xs and its got a gapping hole in the arm pit ordered xl and its not a xl and i normally wear a medium . it is soft thoguh
2.0,It does not stay on your face.  It falls to your neck.
2.0,"This was soooo cute, but way too big for my piercing :("
2.0,"have had these less than 2 months and so far 3 earrings have broke or stones have came out.  too late to return, good thing they didn't cost very much"
2.0,Crazy long
2.0,Disappointed in the sizing. It was way too small for me. Ordered my normal size and the torso was too tight.  Returned immediately. Not sure if I will reorder the next size up because I don't know if it would fit.
2.0,"This is an attractive bracelet; however, I purchased it to wear on vacation and it fell off my wrist several times.  Someone noticed it falling each time, so it was not lost - but I stopped wearing it for that reason."
2.0,Save you money
2.0,No es igual que la foto es muy chiquita
2.0,One size too small. Not a size 8.
2.0,"I purchased this for my best friend for her birthday and it was very well received. It's beautiful, the packaging and the bracelet itself.<br /><br />After a few months of wear the platinum plating peeled off. Waiting to hear from the seller to receive a refund/replacement."
2.0,Hat is not how it looks in picture. Picture looks like a nice stiff and firm hat. Nope not at all like that. Fits flat to your head. Also no description on the buckle style adjuster.
2.0,"I appreciate the quick shipping, and I like the pin how it is.<br /><br />But it's not like the one in the picture. In the picture it's 2 colors, the actual pin is just gold. It's also smaller than I expected (there's nothing in the image to show scale, but the spaces in the font and between the letters are quite different and indicate a slightly larger pin).<br /><br />The weird thing is if it was a picture of the actual product I would have bought it, I like it, so I don't understand why someone would mislead the customer with a picture of a different product."
2.0,Looks really nice and I really like but for some reason whatever itbis made of made my skin irritated and it burns. I don't even have sensitive skin and 2days after putting it on I had the skin reaction.
2.0,Dress is not stylish at all. Very dowdy. I look like a belong to conservative cult. Fake buttons cause gapping and i am not a large woman nor have large breasts.
2.0,"After only 2 weeks of use, the strap is coming apart.  It's cute, small, and light with lots of pockets, which are  all the things that I love in a purse, but it isn't b durable"
2.0,"I like that I got it ahead of estimated delivery, and  I like the picture. But you can never see the whole picture at one time and you also get a good upclose view of what dust looks like"
2.0,1 loop is too big for it to stay buttoned not happy
2.0,"This is an okay turtleneck. Probably not worth the price.<br /><br />Neck is GREAT. That’s hard to get right. They nailed it. Not too tight. Not too loose so you look stupid.<br /><br />Cut of the body fits perfectly and they have the sizing of the neck, chest, sides,  etc. right.<br /><br />Sleeves are okay. Way too loose at the cuff but tight at forearm. Sleeve seams aren’t straight.<br /><br />Shirt is WAAAAAAY too short. Unless you have high-waisted trousers, you’ll have to leave it untucked.<br /><br />So, again, this will work but it isn’t great and not worth the money."
2.0,This is Okay ..... I felt like I wasted my money. It took forever to come & it's so confusing to wear... Don't waste your money in this .
2.0,"Omg the smell is horrid! It’s overwhelming how chemical it smells. VERY hard to see thru. My kid will NOT let me return it, so I’m having to cut some of the mouth out to allow her to see, but if I had my way I’d be returning it today."
2.0,I bought one size up from what I wear in regular shoes. They are still too small.
2.0,Not a fan. The arm holes were too loose and stuck out funny. It wasn't flattering at all
2.0,Came in great packaging and arrived quickly. All rings were broken within a week...total bummer
2.0,"I ordered &#34;Picture Color 1&#34; which is a lighter grey & they sent me &#34;picture colo r2&#34; of the options. I am 6' and 190lbs. The pants & vest were a perfect fit BUT the jacket was much larger than described and the shoulder pads were HUGE and sewn in uneven. I ordered an XL. I fear if I bought the large size-  the pants & vest would be too small but the jacket might be just right. However, I just can't get over how large the shoulder pads were. Shoulder pads on &#34;slim fit&#34; suits should be nearly non-existent."
2.0,Theses run VERY SMALL.
2.0,"I bought these to replace my old studs. I was excited at first to receive my new pair of jewelry, but when they arrived the gem itself was really pretty, but the part I disliked about these earrings the screw. The screw  is so small that it takes hours trying to get it into the post. If you want to buy it go for it, but good luck trying to screw them in."
2.0,"Does not fit well, band is too tight and hat fits like it was made for a child. Also very thick."
2.0,For some reason the neck was super wide. Not like a normal crew neck fit.
2.0,to many warnings about when to wear. Could not  get necklace to close.
2.0,"The key itself is super cute and perfect for my daughters Coraline costume, however the chain was broken and it looked like someone attempted to poorly rework the chain. (See attached photo) not great considering the price, however it’ll do. Just feel meh about it."
2.0,"PROS: 1. The color! ( Army Green) 2. The feel of the fabric ( even though it is rather thin) 3. Packaged nicely<br />CONS: 1. It literally stops two inches above my ankle! Much longer than in the picture. 2. Not very fitted around the rib cage, so this definitely looks 100% like a nightgown.<br /><br />I'm afraid I have to return it :("
2.0,They are very pretty but didn't hold up 5 minutes after put on my cat :(
2.0,"Loved the look and lightweight feel, but these earrings are very fragile and broke easily."
2.0,The pictures make it look much more opaque which is not the case. It's completely see through and looks pretty cheap. I will use it for a beach cover up but I don't think I would wear this dress out of to the party I originally purchased it for. Not the worst but definitely not the best either.
2.0,Way too small; extremely tiny and awkward to try and put them in your ears!!! Definitely not my favorite!!!
2.0,"This sling was the same as one I have on another rifle.  Comparing the 2, the new sling was very hard, the ends stuck together, and the edges had excessive dye and a laquer like buildup.  My older sling was pliable and workable right out of the package, and this new one was 180 degrees the opposite.  I am very disappointed.  If all their (the sling maker) leather products are of like quality I will not be buying anything else from them, and I have plans to pick up other leather goods."
2.0,not really classy
2.0,Wasn't impressed with the way the leather felt.  It felt kind of cheap.  Especially for the price of the bag.  Returned it.
2.0,My daughter loves the print and it is super soft. Only problem is that it really isn’t stretchy enough to go over her head. She likes to wear it around her wrist.
2.0,Regular thin canvas bag. Overpriced.
2.0,This is not a winter scarf.  I was disappointed when I picked up the package and noticed how flat it was and when I pulled the scarf from the bag and saw the lack of volume & warmth.  It is appropriate for a dress or a to add style to a bland blazer.  This is more of a very long neck scarf.
2.0,"The pictures make it look like its a feminine chunky necklace, but in reality it's not even a choker and the chain is only a little more than a centimeter thick. This is NOT cute and I will be returning for a refund."
2.0,I loved the halter tie back neck and open back but the ruching along the chest area didn’t lay right and looked strange on.
2.0,"I didn’t like it at all,don’t waste your money"
2.0,"I ordered this in an x-large, which is what I typically wear. Pant size 14-16.<br />This was huge. Just taking it out of the bag I thought it looked way too big-I could fit 2 of me in it. I returned it. Not only was it huge but it also had no shape."
2.0,not what i expected lens was advertised as penny lens was not to big
2.0,The ad said it had a hood it does not have a hood.
2.0,Poorly made Falls apart in days.
2.0,Very short wasted not long wasted like pictures. An extremely small head needed to fit through hole of collar
2.0,cute but kind of cheap looking
2.0,"This ring was so pretty in the picture.  When it arrived, I was very disappointed.  The ""silver"" part of the ring was very dingy & looked like it had been worn for years!  I tried polishing it & that helped a little.  Would not recommend this ring to anyone else."
2.0,"I really needed this kind of slippers and it was so hard to find at the shops. I followed the reviews regarding sizing. I wear an 8 so I bought the M but it was too big for me. Way too big! I thought the nodules were a little bit higher on the arch since it was a &#34;reflex massage sandals&#34; like the one I bought from another country (which was only 6.50usd)but there was none. Apparently, it's  just like a slider with nodules."
2.0,WAY WAY WAY too small. I wear sz 10-12.  Ordered XL -- fit must be a sz 6-8.<br />Material is pleasant lightweight and quite pretty.<br />Unreturnable
2.0,A little annoyed read reviews got a bigger size then what i wear doesn't fit well oh well
2.0,"For reference I am 5'6, 160 pounds and wear a 40DD bra size. The top fit well everywhere besides the built in bra. The top was way to small and I ordered the largest size I could find. The bottoms were of course the largest size, so they fit too baggy. I returned this piece."
2.0,"Okay, so the fabric is nice and thick enough where the pants aren't see through but not too thick where you get swamp butt, BUT the size in the waist and crotch is too big where as the length is too short. Like awkwardly too short. I'm 5'10 with bodyyyy so I can make them work because I can literally make anything work but they are definitely not at all like what is pictured. Anywho, that's my review. Oh also, the belt looks Uber weird tied because of the fabric used. It just rolls up all kinds of strange."
2.0,"This did not fit me well. Plus the fabric is too thin, a lining would be needed."
2.0,"I needed an eye shield after surgery. The shields have rough edges, the elastic bands don't keep the shield on your face very well, but for my needs, I made them work. I got what I paid for."
2.0,"The color is nice. The fabric is soft. Mobility in them is great. Good for general wear or light exercise.<br /><br />Here’s the thing. These pants do NOT pass the squat test. At all. I was very careful to get the right size, but that didn’t make a difference. The material is too thin, and the fabrication of the garment is too loose. It is loose behind my knees while I stand up straight for goodness sake. For those who are looking for something to get them through more serious workouts, stay away!"
2.0,It is okayishhhhh
2.0,"This product doesn't fit me at all, it looks weird on my face. It's made of a material that isn't particularly flexible so If you have a narrow face like I do, it's not a good fit."
2.0,"I wanted to love this belt, and I actually did for a while. I've had it for about six months, and the leather as well as the finish on the buckle has held up very very well. It's attractive and very easy to put on, adjust and take off.<br /><br /> However……<br /><br />Not long after I got it the latch that attaches the buckle to the belt stopped holding well. It would be fine when I was actually wearing the belt, but very prone to fall off when I was putting the belt on or removing it. That was terribly annoying .<br /><br />And yesterday, about six months after purchase, the latch that adjusts the length of the belt simply fell apart (see attached picture). I have tried to put it back together without success, and I think a very small piece that holds it in place actually broke off. So unless I can find a replacement buckle, which I am not hopeful, I think I'm going to have to throw the whole thing away .<br /><br /> I'm going to be gracious and give it 2 stars rather than 1 because it does have some fine features. However, it does not seem to have the ability to go the distance."
2.0,Purchased these for my son and after a few weeks of use the stride/crotch failed. I would not recommend this item for purchase.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, and it is very soft and comfy but wayyyyyy shorter than it looks like in the picture. It's not really even long enough to count as a dress. It's also pretty thin...my light colored bra could be seen through the fabric at the bust. I am going to have to return it."
2.0,No son como parecen en la foto
2.0,"Purchased two of these tops in a size 2X even though I'm a 1X expecting fit to be quite loose. Instead the fit was loose on top and skin tight around the bottom - exactly where one would hope the fit would be looser in this size range. Also the top is extremely long which ends up making a person look short and dumpy even at 5'7"". The material is 95% polyster, 5% spandex - not a shred of natural fiber. Gross....made in China....need I say more? Kicking myself for this purchase."
2.0,"Earring was beautiful in color, and fit perfectly. But after 3 weeks color starting chipping away. Disappointed.."
2.0,These ripped only after 2 wears
2.0,"I really loved this dress until I tried it on. It fits perfectly everywhere until you look at my hips. There is a “poofy” piece of fabric that sticks out on both hips. It’s as if the dress is made for someone who’s hip bones jut out or has a pocket of extra skin on both sides. I can’t for the life of me understand who that would fit. Just for reference, I am curvy, so my hips aren’t exactly small."
2.0,"UPDATE— I wore this 1 day and the charm and tassel came off.<br /><br />Super cute! I love the triple bands of beads, much more feminine looking than the traditional band!"
2.0,"The earrings are pretty but they broke almost immediately. In addition to the backs not staying on the post (which was fine because I have spare earring backs I could replace them with), a stone fell out (before I even left my house) AND later, an entire section broke off. I planned to just glue the stone back in, but after the other part broke in a way that doesn’t seem reparable, I’m just giving up. I bought the earrings for a specific occasion and I wore them, so I guess I got what I needed from them. But it’s a shame I can’t wear them a second time. Maybe I just got unlucky."
2.0,Pretty dress runs long (I'm 5'6) runs big and it's a little on the heavy side do to the weight of the material.
2.0,I guess They give you 2 since the rings are so cheap they break. We switched the small ring and one is useable. The design itself is nice.
2.0,Tiara arrived with missing stone.
2.0,"Mom jeans. They're not baggy, but they aren't slimming and the position of the back pockets are wide and small so it makes my butt look dated."
2.0,Got these to replace the laces on my Georgia boots. The laces that came with them lasted nearly a year. These lasted 2 days. If you're looking for boot laces to last you awhile these aren't it. I'll be sticking with Georgia/Danner/Redwing laces from now on.
2.0,"Fit is good, true to size, but less than 2 months in it is getting very pilly. Fabric is really poor quality. Look elsewhere"
2.0,Product came ripped at seam
2.0,"I have bought 6 pr of these to see if any of them were sterling silver. They are not, so if you order these clean with a brush and tooth paste. DO NOT use the sterling silver to clean them, or you will see the true metal. Which looks like copper. I think they should send me a year supply, from all my troubles and false advertisement. Then I can just treat them as desposible. Wear a week and when they tarnish, just through them in the trash. Jus' saying the pure truth.."
2.0,I was disappointed when I open the bag they run small yes they fit but tight. They are see thru so my suggestion is to where a black thong. Over all I will wear them to work out in my house. The mesh part is good material. Good for thin people. Thick lil mamas need to get one size or two bigger.
2.0,"The right itself is bulkier than I thought it was going to be.  I ordered the ring size to fit on my ring finger, but the width of the ring itself is so bulky that I can't comfortably wear it.  It will need to be worn as a pendent as a necklace - but it doesn't hold its shape well on its own when open."
2.0,I purchased this in a medium which is what I usually wear. This dress was not attractive at all and It was so large I could fit two of me in it.
2.0,Too stiff....not comfy...
2.0,"This dress looks okay. The style is fine. However, it is shorter than I expected. I thought it would be knee length and it was closer to mid thigh. Also, it's super cheap. The fabric is really cheap and it's made really cheap. It looks cheap. I wouldn't expected this to last."
2.0,"It is supposed to be 3 pairs of hands, I received 1 right hand and 5 lefts! The look of them are ok as long as you don't look too close."
2.0,"Not lush looking....a bit on the cheap side. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I wanted to have plenty of extra room, so ordered an XXL  Still very small.  Like the material"
2.0,the literally tangle ALL THE TIME. i had to fix this threw out the whole day
2.0,"I ordered a large pair of the ombre green socks. According to the sizing chart I was barely a large over medium, so I figured a large would work fine. I was super excited when I got them, but I was very disappointed when I tried them on. They were very tight which was nice, but they stretched so much that the beautiful deep color of the socks was was distorted by the bright white underneath.<br /><br />That's fine. I just sent them back, got a refund, and waited patiently for them to restock their inventory as I saw it was going to happen a few months later. Well, here we are, they've restocked, but instead of resizing the extra larges, they simply removed the option. My calves are not particularly large either. They have about a 17 inch circumference. If they were to restock those XL, I would happily change this rating. I'm extremely disappointed."
2.0,Nice shirt but runs a bit small.
2.0,"Not fan of the material, wore it once only because of this reason"
2.0,Very see through and poorly made. I will be returning this.
2.0,Se paró
2.0,Fits. Does not smooth or control anything. I am not overweight. I’ve had 4 pregnancies that have left the belly region less toned than I would like. I had hoped this would at least smooth a little. Sadly does not. So I am returning 😢
2.0,Material is very cheap for what you pay. I expected something a little better constructed.
2.0,Did not help stretch western boots one iota. Waste of money.
2.0,"Arrived quick but my clasp was welded shut, got a refund for it!"
2.0,The material is very thin and stretchy. It would need a full body shaper underneath to prevent all bumps and bulges from showing.
2.0,The material is kind of hard and uncomfortable. I would not recommend this shirt. I don't think I will wear mine again.
2.0,"I actually use rashguards for walking and jogs during the hot summer months. They are a protective and attractive alternative. so it was with high hopes that I ordered this one. It looks sporty and colourful. The fabric is nice and it seems well made.  But for whom? I didn't know. The sizing is wildly off. It is small., ridiculously small. Granted garments of this type are supposed to fit snugly and I did order up. But this could not accommodate a curvy medium much less and XL. No room at the bust and the arms are too tight to provide any range of motion. Good idea badly executed."
2.0,"Much, much smaller than I thought it would be, and very short chain. I ended up giving it to my daughter, as it wasn't what I was hoping I'd ordered for myself."
2.0,They started to tear in less than a month
2.0,"I received these shoes as expected. However, I was very disappointed when i opened the package and found that they were not the traditional lace up shoes as pictured but the quick elastic closures. It it wasn't such a hassle to return the shoes (they weren't shipped in a box) I would return them right away. I was hoping to have the lace up shoes to teach my child how to tie them but I guess I'll have to find another pair to teach him with."
2.0,Purchased the compression socks due to me having surgery. There not tight enough and most of all do not come all the way to my knees for compression.
2.0,"received complements on the look... but it for a too small, even when ordered larger."
2.0,Giving this product a 2 star because of the quality of the metal (if it even is metal) was cheap and plastic feeling. The ring attached to the butterfly itself was not closed or welded all the way which had the butterfly fall off. Not worth the $9 as I could have easily paid cheaper on Aliexpress or Wish for the same quality. Eventually returned the productz
2.0,Color faded and changed to gold shortly after I started using it.
2.0,Very small for adult wear
2.0,Material was thinner than expected and the tan is very brown; too dark for my color scheme. But otherwise okay.
2.0,They are cheap and flimsy. The case that came with it is cheap too. The zipper broke after just a couple of uses.
2.0,"This is one of those blouses that in theory could have worked, but just doesn't. First of all, the 'one size' for the actual sizing is laughable. Whatever happened to small, medium, large, extra large? What I received was a medium, and it SHOULD have fit, but this is clearly Asian sizing. When will Amazon understand the average American woman is not built the same way? UGH! Then there's the fabric of the blouse. Some sort of cheap polyester that had no give whatsoever, so if you're busty or have 'gravity handles', you're out of luck. Smaller busted women with not an ounce of fat, or for junior girls this may work, but the fabric is cheap. The sleeves are adorable, but on me, I saw a hint of Carmen Miranda, and all that was missing was the bowl of fruit on my head. All in all, the purchase was a mistake, and I warn anyone interested in this blouse to be aware of sizing and the quality of the fabric. It's on it's way back..."
2.0,Did not fit my watch.
2.0,"Not made to traditional Buddhist tradition. And some other issues. I'm keeping them though. But of course I only have the sellers word that the beads are indeed sandalwood...<br />I had a hard time finding sandalwood malas, so I bought this one, the problem is that mala's are supposed to be strung on three  threads, and the turquoise divider beads seem to be plastic, then some tacky silver colored metal filigree larger than the turquoise beads and were not only tacky looking but tacky to touch, like unset glue. So, the sandalwood beads are going to be reworked on by a friend with real turquoise and three threads as is the custom in Buddhist tradition. I'm a new child of the Buddha and I'm just glad to have the number 108 beads exactly. so I can do this."
2.0,The lobster claw clip is decoration only. It doesn't slide open to clip on the collar ring. You still need another clip to connect it. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Although the cut was good the fabric has no ‘velvet’ texture or appearance. These are very heavy stretch denim type jeans. They appear to run significantly small, which may speak well for compression if you can get them on."
2.0,"I had too return these.  I was surprised to find a large serged seam about 1"" down from the top of the back heel flap (about 3"" up from the bottom of my heel).  This rubbed exactly where the heel cup of my five-fingers ended... terrible placement; would have certainly let to blisters and chafing."
2.0,"These looked fresh, but broke with the quickness."
2.0,The shirt is very nice. I was expecting it to be a sweatshirt not a long sleeve t-shirt. it is very thin.
2.0,"Although I love the style and fit of this shirt, the stripes are pink instead of red. Not light red, not faded red, pink. Definitely pink. Disappointing."
2.0,this hat would be best suited for a child
2.0,"Very cheap material and badly made. Undervest is very, very short and far too thin and baggy. Get what you pay for I guess."
2.0,scratched on arrive
2.0,"Love the design and fit. However, after one month, the second hand has broken. I am reaching out to the Swatch manufacturer and considering taking it to someone who can repair."
2.0,Very beautiful but needs another strap to hold in place. It flips around ontop of your foot and will end up sideways Since its so heavy. Also my feet are size 8 and occasionally my toe slips out since they are loose on me so id suggest if you order to have atleast that size foot if not larger. Also when mine arrived one piece had disconnected and needed re attached
2.0,Beautiful watch band however the pins are very flimsy and wouldn't even secure correctly. I bought a previous onw in a different color and it waa great. Not sure what happened.
2.0,I wasted impressed with this shirt. Cheaply made and not a flattering
2.0,not like the others I bought totally different material and buttons
2.0,"Latch hook sucks, always falls off!"
2.0,"Not what I expected, we are just keeping she can use for sleep over supplies"
2.0,"Very thin, cheap material that had several fabric pulls resulting in some small holes when I tried to straighten the material. I will still wear it but am not pleased with the condition."
2.0,"I absolutely LOVED this pendant; however, after a few weeks of wear the chain totally came undone. The necklace kept getting longer and longer. I am not certain about that, as I've never seen it before. I emailed the vendor but never received a response."
2.0,Looks cheap and childish.
2.0,"I like the fit and color, but I really do not like all the lines appeared after washing as instructed.  It has a dark wrinkle lines everywhere. It looks like stain and blood vines... too bad it's too poor fabric, otherwise it is a lovely dress."
2.0,"I really want to like this pant.. its beautiful and flowy and the colors are accurate as in the picture. I ordered the brown. I wear a size 14 dress and the large fit well...i love the loose style..... But i had to return for two reasons..<br />1. the waist band like many others describe bunched and the elastic was all twisty<br />2. I think they sent me an used dress, it was shrunk all over, not folded and packed well and smelled badly.<br />It's a soft material but not see through, not sure how it will hold after a wash.<br />But I really like the style, so if they fix the waistband and awful stitching, i would buy this.. till then NO!"
2.0,It is a lot heavier than you would want a necklace to be
2.0,One of these broke right out the bag
2.0,"For people who suffer from bloating and colitis, these pants are the worse. Extremely tight and suffocating. I guess for a very flat tummy would work fine. They are warm for sure, but very itchy and not convenient for thin tops or sweaters to be wearing on top."
2.0,My granddaughter wasn't able to wear too tight in the waist
2.0,"I ordered these in wide calf, since my claves are about 15.25 inches, and they wouldn't even come close to zipping. The foot was also extremely narrow, and I have skinny feet and they were tight on me.<br /><br />The color was nice, but I could tell they would be uncomfortable.<br /><br />Returned for a refund"
2.0,"I ordered these pants in a medium because the product claimed that they were made of a stretchy material. When I received the pants they were made of a tough material. I put them on and they fit but they were a little tight on my thighs, when I sat down the pants completely fell apart. If you are going to order these size up. I wasn't able to wear them once."
2.0,Great idea but my order was repackahe with slashed bag! So returning for replacement
2.0,"How I regret not reading reviews prior purchasing two Minibee Women's Boho Embroidered Linen Shirts!<br />Instead, I purchased without reading reviews because the style and color of the shirts in the photo was close to what I was hoping for a summer change.<br /><br />Big mistake.  Because as others mentioned, the material was very thin, and not true linen quality.  Worse, the blouses were way overpriced for these inferior made tops.<br /><br />Lesson learned: READ REVIEWS PRIOR PURCHASE!"
2.0,It was wrinkled on the bottom and the zipper to close the purse already broke.  For the price I guess I didn't expect much but thought it would last longer than it did.  I like the idea of the purse and several other items but will spend more next time
2.0,This top would be cute with a more snug fit. The strap is too long without any hold so it slides back and forth leaving your girls exposed.
2.0,"It’s beautiful, but it’s unraveling. Cannot wear anymore. Did not last long"
2.0,Just looked a little too fake for me.
2.0,The dress fit  ok but the sleeves were too small for the rest of the dress. Had to return .
2.0,"Love the earrings and color, broke after wearing them one time.<br /><br />Would really appreciate a refund and relacement!"
2.0,"It's pretty, but small, not worth the price."
2.0,"Ordered a size 8, the actual shoes are more like a 6-1/2 or 7. Wish they'd been the right size. Sad :("
2.0,"Well, it’s cute… but I ordered a size small& I received an EXTRA small 😕"
2.0,Gold belt came damaged!
2.0,"Smaller than I expected, nicely made"
2.0,Too long and the material is very thin and see through
2.0,These pieces are very beautiful but the quality is very poor. This is the first time I broke out around the neck area wearing 4 out of 5 pieces of jewelry. The chain is very badly coated.
2.0,Looked nice but made cheap. The bracelet bends very easily and came apart at the clasp on day one.
2.0,Smaller than what I expected the  credit cards are very hard to get into the slots..
2.0,Not very great not really strong on the blue
2.0,Not high waisted. I looked like a fat marshmallow with a camel toe.
2.0,"you can see through the top half and its kind of baggy ,but the color was great.<br />Returned it"
2.0,"Will not take a chance with this company again. Watches are advertised as LADIES, but they fit the four year old next door.  All was not lost.........I donated them to a worthy cause that will make sure  that some little girls will think they are very special , and that's what matters."
2.0,I can't knock how pretty this dress is...it's gorgeous!! My issue is the sizing. I normally wear a large so after reading the reviews I ordered an XXL in this dress. It was too small & way too short! I wish the sizing was different 😩
2.0,"When I received these slippers, my first impression was disbelief at the size of the slippers. At first, I thought they must be for men. But after double-checking the listing, it was clear that they were intended for women. I wear a 10-10.5 wide, so I ordered a size 11, but these slippers are HUGE. The listing states that the insoles are deerskin suede, but upon looking at the slipper, it is clearly fabric, not suede. The sole itself is also fabric and is very flat, with little cushioning and no arch support. Although the stitching is done well, the actual shape of the slipper is almost like a ""clown shoe"". The fabric is a faded blue stripe, almost like old mattress ticking. Overall, I am unimpressed, and think that a buyer could find a better product."
2.0,Love the NINE WEST BRAND.<br /><br />Item was never received from seller. Hence the 2 stars.<br />Disappointed. Had to buy another dress last minute.
2.0,"Like them very much as the inside plush lining was very plush and the fit was snug due to the plush. After 3 months in, the plush lining has flattened and worn out. Feels like a cheap house slipper afterwards"
2.0,Don't know where the 'antique' applies. Cheap metal but it's simplicity might allow it to be wearable.
2.0,The eye of my sneaker was very small and had a hard time lacing.  I finally  got them on and they work just fine .
2.0,Pockets too small. Phone keeps falling out.
2.0,Go Fish.
2.0,These are certainly pretty but they don’t fit well…. The straps are flimsy and break in the process of putting the mask on……
2.0,The sleeves are way too short! They are like 3/4 length. I am sending back
2.0,It’s just k
2.0,Very thin. Not comfortable.
2.0,"Beautiful, soft fabric.....however, NOT high quality as the seem under the bust was very noticeably crooked once the dress was tried on. Unfortunately, now I have to deal with a return."
2.0,"I asked for this watch for my birthday. My brother got it for me. It was an awesome watch! I loved it! Everybody stopped to look at it. However, about two months later, the battery died. I went to the jeweler to get new batteries. That worked for about two days. Now it keeps resetting itself. I know this is not a quality watch, and I will not suggest it to anyone."
2.0,"Very hot polyester material. I was expecting a cotton/poly blend. Nope, it was like thin nylon. It had no stretch at all so it just gaped open at the arm holes. Sent it back."
2.0,"The pretty picture on the belt, just peel off after 5days use. Feel bad. My little daughter not wear it any more ."
2.0,"Super thin material, like a long sleeve tshirt with a hood.  Will not keep you warm.  I guess I expect flannel to be thicker, not just “look” like flannel."
2.0,I like the dress itself but way to small.
2.0,"So I love the colors and they came exactly as pictures but I honestly felt like with the placement of the fabric that I was wearing a curtain. It just made me feel large (yes I am 7 months pregnant, however I'm not as large as this shirt made me feel)."
2.0,"Too small. Wouldn't hold what I need to carry -- Iphone, wallet and iPad mini tablet is all I carry. Return process worked quite easily."
2.0,It's smaller than other nightgowns the same size.  It's not cotton.  But it is soft.
2.0,This item is really cute looking BUT the white design around the border is made of a sticky-tacky type of raised embossing that causes the tunic to flare weirdly at the bottom.  I returned.
2.0,"Me quedo grande, no vi especificado el talle y en la foto se veia pequeña por eso la compre. No digo que sea culpa suya, pero la verdad que para el tipo de reloj que es que mide pulsaciones me queda grande y no me sirve, porque no arroja datos precisos"
2.0,"The clips constantly fall off, and the strap will either fall down or cut off circulation to your thighs. There is no inbetween."
2.0,"When these arrived before wash I noticed they were significantly smaller than another well known brand size 2t jammies. About 2 inches smaller in width and length in the top.<br /><br />We tried them anyway since my son loves Mickey and they were his Valentine's gift. They were good enough but he wouldn't be able to wear them long.<br /><br />Then we washed them once, and now they would only fit a newborn. They were washed once on cold and dried on delicates and shrunk SOOOOO much. We will never be able to wear them again. So disappointed in Disney's quality."
2.0,"I normally wear a pants size 0-3 but these ""one size"" leggings were way too tight to be comfortable on me, could barely pull them all the way up. They fit nothing like this company's regular, unlined ""one size"" leggings. - Their regular leggings fit and are comfortable!"
2.0,Disappointed in size. Ordered a plus size but seems more like an large than a plus size.
2.0,"For the cost of these glasses you do not expect 10 cent frames!! The lenses are wonderful, but be extra careful with the frame. Any stress sideways will snap one of the ear piece sections, as my frame snapped while taking the sunglasses off."
2.0,too small - could only fit a small wallet and cell phone.
2.0,"Pretty, but runs small..."
2.0,Sizing is way off; it came from China.
2.0,Neck could be smaller  Photo is not like what you recieve
2.0,one side would not slide into the slot no matter what I do. it's cute and lightweight it came on time just sucks that only one side fits!
2.0,inconsistent sizing. one is a lot bigger than the other on the foot so there’s no compression on one.<br />like one is size 6-8 and the other is an 8-10.
2.0,not as described. sleeves were way bigger
2.0,It made me look pregnant
2.0,Cheap. Falling apart within a week.  Incredibly disappointing for my kids.
2.0,"Definitely size up. My son wore it once and it was already too small even though I ordered his size, after I washed it looks like it can fit a 6 month old"
2.0,"It's an ok hat,but color is off,more of a mulberry color.  Not the rose pink  I wanted but maybe I'll give it to someone."
2.0,"Cute, but fell apart after being washed once."
2.0,"This is a very well made suit and arrived exactly as pictured and described.  Unfortunately, I'm giving it a low rating because it should have been advertised as a petite.  I am 5'5 and even with the straps let all the way out, the bra cups were still several inches lower than where they should have been.  If you are 5'3 or shorter I would say definitely give it try; anyone taller than that should pass.  I've requested a refund and waiting for the company to process my request and send me a shipping label.  Very sad this did not fit, because it would have been a great retro look and very flattering to curvier figures."
2.0,As soon as I took this watch out of the box I knew I was going to return it. I could tell just by the sound the parts made when I took it out. Made with lightweight low quality parts.  The blue portions of the band were scratched when I opened it.  I could tell it would break with the littlest wear and tear.  The picture makes it look like its made of quality metal but it actually has more the feel of being made out of plastic.  Just didn't feel right.  I wouldn't buy it for $15.  You are better off paying more money for the higher quality.
2.0,I really wanted this skirt and I ordered my size and it's WAY to small. Very disappointing
2.0,Cute but came with a small hole in the top and kitty is missing an ear. Got it gift so I’m not going to bother returning. My 4.5 year olds loves them and has lots of room to grow into them.
2.0,"This product came with only 8 windows (4 sections), not 10 windows as advertised."
2.0,"Like other reviewers said these leg warmers did NOT come with the strings, which definetly takes away from the look. Do not buy these if you want them to look like the picture presented b/c they are missing half of the product! Very disappointed!"
2.0,"Not big enough for my Samsung phone, and wallet"
2.0,"This is the second package I bought but different vendor. I sized up (Large) on my order but the bigger size I got is exactly the same as the Medium that I recently purchased. The waist tends to roll down.  2 good things about it are, the silky feel of it and no panty line."
2.0,Love the look and the concept but when I first tried to unsnap the pouch the snap came completely off. Then when I put the Hoodie on it was too small. The sizes are either really off or I got one that was sized wrong.
2.0,I have small feet and I buy boys dress shoes for work. I work in a pharmacy so I'm on my feet all day but wouldn't consider the conditions rough on the shoes by any stretch of the imagination. I will say they get points for being comfortable but that's about it. After less than a month of use the glue between the two layers of the sole failed and the shoe started to separate. I've owned several pairs of Toms and up until this pair I never had a problem with quality or durability. Needless to say I found these to be a disappointing buy. More importantly I would never buy them for a young boy because any amount of activity by the child and these things are done for.
2.0,Decent fit but holy horrible fabric ... think your moms poly fake satin like style pajamas from the 70s and 80s
2.0,"Cute but hardware fell off while using, the pieces screw on, lost screw on piece"
2.0,This dress ripped at the seam after one wash. I didn’t even get to wear it.
2.0,"Very cute but I’m very disappointed that it didn’t come with all the peices that hold the earring together, needed this for my bridesmaids for my wedding day."
2.0,"Looks cheap, metal not great.  I know you get what you pay for, but I have replaced this at the same price with a band I far prefer. I don't like the NATO style either, but that's not their fault, just my preference."
2.0,"Top has a pre-shaped bra form that is simply ridiculous. It fits no-one. After it did not fit me, I passed it around hoping it would fit someone else.<br />Everybody laughed and complained about the top. So sad, since its otherwise a great design. Bottoms are cute."
2.0,"Wood necklace seems like nice quality, but looks nothing like the pictures. Very light color, not a dark beautiful color like in the pictures. Wouldn’t have purchased if I knew it wasn’t stained dark…"
2.0,Comes loose throughout the day. Fails at being a belt.
2.0,"Very boxy and not flattering at all. Nothing like what I expected. I returned the dress. I gave it 2 stars because the material is super heavy and great quality. But the fit of the dress was......yeah, no."
2.0,Uppers are flimsy and pockets tore after first washing!
2.0,"Ok for starters these are nearly clear with almost no hints of green to my disappointment. That's one strike/star. Secondly the description does not say dangle like some of the other products from this company so I was expecting a huggy type of earring when really it's a dangle, the gem is several mm below the earlobe, and that is exactly what I was trying to avoid. There's the second strike/ star. Third the lever isn't well made I can see these breaking with regular use in less than a month. The lever isn't tight so it goes left to right. Overall you get what you pay for and take a chance with the online shopping experience. Next time I'll go to a local shop and see before I buy. Very disappointed"
2.0,"I am 5'7&#34;, 100 pounds. My measurements are 31, 25, 35. I ordered a US tag size medium and it fit. You have to remember that these are Chinese sizes, so they are SUPER TINY. I am returning the item, though, because of the material. The fabric is a thin stretch rayon. That means when you look at the fabric, it almost has that &#34;waffle shirt&#34; texture to it. Due to the thinness of the fabric, the collar and lapels are 'flappy' and do not hold their shape. As a seamstress, I thought about putting an interfacing and lining into the jacket so I could keep it, but that thought led me to evaluate the construction of the jacket. The stitching is uneven in some places and the collar is not even. Most people wouldn't notice that when you wear it though."
2.0,"Look really nice and seem to be decent quality but I think they run way small, I'd say a half size smaller than they should be at least."
2.0,Very cheap looking for a man or woman. Very disappointed
2.0,If you're a size 8 1/2 to 9 don't bother purchasing these foot liners because they will only continue to fall off your foot due to a poor elastic design. They look better than they perform.
2.0,I don't know where to start. This wasn't oversized it was just very big and I was very disappointed because it was not what I was expecting at all. Lastly there was no product tag and that just seems a little sketchy to me and it smelled like smoke
2.0,Frames turned out to be of rather poor quality.  The color around the frame began to chip off within a few weeks of purchase.  Also the nose pads plating wore away down to the base metal and began to discolor my nose.  Would not recommend
2.0,I like the variety of sizes however they are pretty difficult to put on and close... to be honest it hurts my nose when I try to close it
2.0,"While I received the SIZE I ordered this was NOT a maxi dress as shown in the pictures.  The photo is clearly a dress that brushes the ground, as a maxi dress should.  This is, at best, a midi dress."
2.0,"Socks are nice and thick,however holes seem to form in the toe area.in every pair."
2.0,Had to return because they were too big.  I even went down a size like other reviews and they just slipped off my feet.  I suggest looking for a different shoe/slipper.
2.0,This shirt has a super low neck and the 2xl fits more like a medium/large. Not a relaxed fit at all. I would say its more like a workout tank.
2.0,"it's really perspective, and the cloth just like plastic and not comfortable. it is a little bit weird even u wear vest under it."
2.0,After one wash decal was crinkly and peeling off
2.0,"They were pretty. My biggest issue is that I've lost several, the stud doesn't go deep enough into the plastic part. If I used them for my nose they'd be perfect. But in my lip it's not working out."
2.0,All the gold came off.  I just got it and my husband wore it a few times.  Very disappointed.  He really likes it too
2.0,"Nice blouse, however material was so thin."
2.0,"Material was different than the floral one I ordered, so this one was too tight would need a XXL with this type of material."
2.0,This shirt was to big but going to keep it.  I like it just a lio big on me and I oredered the small!
2.0,The shoe quality is as expected. Its a soft soul and thin material so the baby can walk easily. The stitching and quality is fine. However two major downfalls. First off the sizing is way off. I ordered a 12-18 month shoes and received a shoes that had tags for 9-12 Months. Needless to say the shoe did not fit. I contacted the company and they said the size they sent me was the largest one they own and that the size on amazon are just a suggestion. They ended up refunding me $2 and let me keep the shoe. (which is why i gave them 2 starts instead of 1) So I will have to use them on the next baby. Second is the shoe is similar to the pictures but NOT the same shoe. The color is a little more sandy then in the picture which is not a big deal but it also does not have the grips on the bottom of the shoe and its not a high top shoe it fits right under the ankle like all shoes.
2.0,these socks were way too big. the sizing is way off. not happy at all.
2.0,Fit excellent but not a Compression material. Regular spandex material.
2.0,I wanted to get these so I could see what the piercing would like on me. Everyone’s mentioned how it would suit me to get my septum done but I’ve been squimish to get it. I bought these and BOY does the magnet hurt my nose. Accidentally touch it while it’s been on for awhile? My eyes water it hurts. Guess I could’ve expected that or maybe I could just go get the actual piercing… but man these weren’t “it” for me.
2.0,Not what I expected...it didn't work for me at all. I gave it away.
2.0,"Extremely sheer fabric and far too short. I'm 5' 6&#34; and it hits me mid calf. If the length and thickness of fabric were different, I would love it."
2.0,"color is much different than the picture, and was not a fan of the material.  But very comfortable."
2.0,"The material was very poor, wrinkles would not come out. fits as expected."
2.0,"I'm a 34c so I purchased the C cup.  It was perfect fit, but the silicon wouldn't stay in the position I needed it.  No matter how long I held it in place it kept releasing on the sides.  Maybe I needed to go a cup down for a firmer hold, I'm not sure.  I messed with it for an hour during a wedding ceremony before taking it off and just opting for a different bra and subsequently,  an outfit change."
2.0,"Beware:  This does NOT appear to have a silver-plate finish as described.  It will go with my antiqued silver charms, maybe, which is the ONLY reason I'm not returning it.  It has a grayish tone like stainless steel.  Here is a photo for comparison of a very same bracelet from a competator that arrived with the same order (different sizes) Yeshan is on the left."
2.0,"When I opened the box I was surprise to find a small, wrong colored stone, and tangeled chain. I was very disappointed and don't recommend buying this."
2.0,Waste of my time and money the material they made it with is somewhat of a net so that's uncomfortable and it does not fit right and sizing is way of xxxl is large us size no way mine fit exact and that is the last adjustment doesn't hold down your tummy I saw that in other pictures that the material looked different than what I received
2.0,Half my boob hangs out. It might fit my 7 yo.  I don't have big boobs but I guess made in China they expected me to be absolutely flat.
2.0,you can't sit comfortably in this.  Wore it to work and had to take it off on my lunch break. Didn't really hold in the muffin top either.  Very disappointed.  waste of money.
2.0,"I received the item pretty promptly. Appreciate the fast service, however the bud of the earring was bent and I carefully had to straighten out without the risk of breaking it off."
2.0,Too big...going to send back and order smaller size.
2.0,Looked great with everything except it broke after two weeks
2.0,"US size 38 DDD.  purchased per chart. 38E<br />would not go around my chest at all. like 4"" from closing.<br />Niece is 34 D. too small for her as well.<br />returned."
2.0,"Cute hat, but the material is too loose and looks awkward on my head, regardless of how loose or tight I make the hat. Might be good if you prefer larger hat sizes, but otherwise it's no good."
2.0,HUGE!!! Don't know any man who would actually carry it.  Also weak zipper.
2.0,"The material isn’t at all what I expected. I thought it’d be sweatshirt like, nope it’s this cheap silky feeling. Not happy with it at all. Goodwill bound!<br /><br />UPDATE:  The customer service is on point. They reached out after my review and they’re sending me a different shirt which I got to pick out. Very impressed with their customer service! If the new shirt is better quality I’ll definitely increase my review!"
2.0,Returning. The bust area runs very small.
2.0,"I wore this twice in one week, and it's already lost two stones. On it's inaugural first introduction into society I went out for a bite and caught a movie with a few friends. I wore it sans pendant and received quite a few compliments. Unfortunately once i got home I noticed that the chain was missing a rock, and also had a slight angled bend in a few spots. Nonetheless a few nights later thinking that it would still look good enough for a second exhibition (tucked beneath a V-neck Tee with the few twisted areas and missing jewel hidden) I rocked it once more. Regrettably half-way through the evening I became aware that yet another gem had vanished. :("
2.0,"had I paid attention and noticed these were mostly acrylic, I would not have purchased them, They make your feet hot and sweaty, and in summer that is unacceptable."
2.0,We received this watch as a replacement for my husbands original that I got for his B-Day. It was suppose to be durable. The Chrystal face has broken once again. Please refund or add it to my amazon gift card please. TY
2.0,"Ehhh very cheaply made, you get what you paid for"
2.0,Item too small. Probably will fit one size larger.
2.0,"After reading the reviews, I sized up because I have pretty big thighs and a med/large booty.<br />I'm 5'4, 130lb. I could definitely have gone with the medium. The size large was bulky and unflattering<br />with a lot of space in the front making it look frumpy.<br />Get your normal size."
2.0,"This 'dress' was too short for me at 5'8, and the fit in the back was pretty awkward so I returned it."
2.0,"So the leggings are true to size and definitely soft but these leggings are horrible for athletic use. The material is way too hot, and definitely see thru. I can see thru the fabric without them even on. I’d say these would be good to wear in the fall or winter time with a long sweater because they are cute, soft and the material gets you hot. However, I don’t think it’s good at all for athletic use, which is what I bought it for."
2.0,"These earrings are a great price and look great, but after about 2 months they broke. I previously bought a set that look very similar from a big box store and they broke after a month so I was extra careful when removing these each time."
2.0,"I got the cropped grey merle top in a small and it was way too big. I’m 5’2, 115 lbs and get smalls in all of my workout tops but this ones sizing is definitely off. Goes down a lot farther than a normal workout crop top and the sleeves are at a very awkward length. Material is thinner than other workout tops i’ve ordered from amazon."
2.0,"XL, described as size 13-15, are very tight on my size 12 feet.  I’ll be returning.  Very disappointing. Seem like good socks otherwise but don’t get seduced by the sizes."
2.0,"These look good and if you're only going to use them for a prayer or meditation session they should be fine.  However,  I wanted a mala that I could keep on my wrist all the time, including in the shower.  These are not for that as the seeds crack and break off. I'm going to send mine back and get something more sturdy."
2.0,These are big and won’t stay up. I’m told the material is soft and is comfortable.
2.0,This item is cheaply made.  It fits a little small and lace was torn up even though washed on delicate.  Do not recommend.
2.0,Hated the openings (peek-a-boo) slits on the sides.  They poke out awkwardly and mess up the flow of the dress...it went from being a cool evening dress on a cruise to a bathing suit cover up :-(
2.0,Not professional work pants. Material is similar to spandex.
2.0,I ordered an x-large and recieved a small. Will be returning.
2.0,"So these earrings where so cute and never came loose or un tightened. My daughter wore them all the time. Until she rubbed against the couch and the deer fell off, the stud still in her ear  we had these earrings for 4months."
2.0,The material is beautiful however if you're 5'7 and above with long legs this will not be long enough. It hit me at that weird unflattering spot just above my ankles and far below my calves.
2.0,I needed something very snug in the waist and this didn't come close.
2.0,"Holy cheap and small. Only M and 3x available and reviews showed that it runs small. Because of this, I took a chance on a 3x, even though I normally wear a 1X/XL. The material is so stiff with no stretch, thus it was challenging to get on and rode up instantly because the pre-stitched breast area was incredibly small and the arm holes tight and unflattering.  I knew it would be short as in the pictures, but with the riding up, it became more of a shirt than a dress. It may work for someone with a smaller chest and hips and probably only for naughty time, not in public. This is going back.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5’9”, 240-ish lbs. with 40DDD chest and hourglass shape."
2.0,"This dress had great potential but the execution is terrible.<br /><br />- I'm short (5'3"") and this hits right at an awkward midcalf length. It's not midi-length but not floor length. Just short enough to look awkward.<br /><br />- Arrived with holes in it from being sewn incorrectly. The biggest hole being in the right pocket, it was a solid 4 inches and made the pocket unusable.<br /><br />- Fabric is particularly thin and even the dark green color is nearly see-through.<br /><br />- Threads and poorly sewn seams all over the outside, inside isn't much better.<br /><br />- This dress had potential but is absolutely not worth the $40. Won't last more than a wash or two."
2.0,It’s cute but the straps are basically useless. I had to take the straps out and make my own out of black ribbon.
2.0,After about a week the top decorations on the shoes fell off.
2.0,Arms are too tight.  Fabric is thin.
2.0,My daughter is a solid size 6. The dress was huge on her so I ordered a 5t and 4 and although the length was shorter they were also huge on the waist. If I stick w it I may have to get it taken in.
2.0,Jajaa
2.0,I bought this because the reviews says it’s for women with big breasts. I’m a 32H and this was not for me running in it. This is more for yoga with no impact. I also don’t need the pads that came with these. My breasts are already big enough
2.0,"When I received the purse, I thought it was adorable and just the right size to carry my IPHONE and a few cards.<br />After a week of using it, the sewn threads on the back of the purse unraveled and the strap came off. Upon close inspection, I noticed the same process was occurring on the second strap. So cute, but unfortunately it's not well made."
2.0,"Nice color, even with following the size guide it runs very small."
2.0,"Cute with logo of superheros, but the nose strip was not secured and the stitching came off in one mask. Other masks had every sharp nose strip poking thru & my kid had scratches on cheek."
2.0,"This shirt shrinks like none other, and the material is very translucent and feels like gauze. After one wash it is unwearable."
2.0,Very disappointed in quality
2.0,Order the next size up. They were way too small.
2.0,"Thought these would be much smaller, or at least adjustable"
2.0,too baggy and poor material
2.0,The suit gapes quite a bit if you are not standing up or laying down.
2.0,Is a pretty set. Stone inside is very cheap and does not look like the picture. One side is flat so if it turns it won’t even shine. Had it one week and the “gold” tarnished and turned brown and copper color. Too bad the quality is bad because it was pretty.
2.0,Not the material I was expecting and way to large.
2.0,"So I bough these a while ago; however, I have worn them roughly 20 times. The fabric near the toes is thinner than the rest of the sock.  I always keep my toe nails cut nice. I have 3 pair of them with holes in them. They are a great price, but I have socks I paid double for that have lasted me years."
2.0,Too small and material is gross and rough. Would be cute if material inside was soft and definitely order 1-2 sizes up.
2.0,"The black one is pretty good for a cheap shirt -I wear them all the time to work but the blue one however is thinner and runs a little bit smaller in size,  it is also very very wrinkly. Just be aware. I get the large because I like them a bit loose fitting."
2.0,"Product looked nice. My brother loved it as a gift. But within a day of wearing it he noticed that it wasn't keeping time properly. The watch was defective and had to be sent back. May just be this one. Buy at your own risk. Was able to send back with prime, but it was sad giving a defective gift. (Especially since he really liked the watch before he knew it wasn't working)."
2.0,"I don't know, maybe my head is just wider then most although i've never had anyone tell me that. When  I put it on it pinches my head cuz the frame isn't wide enough. Looks like a good product but too small wish it came in a wider size"
2.0,I purchased the belts in response to a search for belts that could be used with the Marino ratchet belt buckle. They were to WIDE to fit through the buckle and so were returned for refund.
2.0,It is a old mobel
2.0,"The dress color and design are different from the picture, which was very disappointing. Thin, cookie cutter made, runs small, the design isn’t the same as the picture. I ordered what was suppose to be a 10-12 XL more of a 8-10."
2.0,"Color was not as expected, it was supposed to be olive green and it was more of a puke brown"
2.0,I have only worn these a few times and the frame cracked. I loved how they looked and I am disappointed in the lack of quality in these glasses. I take very good care of my glasses but these barel lasted. I think I only wore the 6 or 7 times.
2.0,El color no es igual por el resto está perfecto thanks Amazon
2.0,"Far too small, had to junk."
2.0,"I like the fit, but the construction is a bit off. The lense fell out almost immediately and it doesn't fit back into the rim correctly. There's a gap between the lense and the frame. They're fine for yard work, but I don't expect them to last long."
2.0,Unfortunately I'm going to have to return this watch..the hour hand is off centered and instead of going inside (which I shouldn't have to do) and adjusting it..im going to send it back and opt for a different watch
2.0,Material is thin and doesnt stay in place
2.0,"Let me start by saying the dress is awesome! But going by sizing and other reviews with the same body type, the XL should’ve fit. Also the bows are nothing like the picture or other people’s! I’m assuming a different manufacturer but now I’m worried if I size up it’ll be too big. Also the length is made for a very tall person haha, like why is it SO long"
2.0,It too small would not recommend
2.0,I absolutely love the color of this purse ! I received many compliments the first week of wearing it BUT after a week the handle broke ! I am super sad because I loved it for that week I was able to use it!
2.0,these gloves were ok after putting on the first time but after taking off the gloves the 2nd layer turned inside out and you cannot fix the inside to put it back on. When i was actually able to war the glove they were warm.
2.0,"Pretty color, not satisfied with the product, I brought a size Medium, I’m 5’5 and weighs 131 it was small and short.. it will fit me as blouse, but not as a dress."
2.0,Broke 2 days after having keys on it
2.0,"Cute boots, but not adequate toe room. The top of the boot rubbed my nails so I had to return them."
2.0,"These shoes run very small in my opinion...contrary to others reviews! I ordered true to size for my daughter and couldn't squeeze her foot into these shoes even with thin stockings. So disappointed as they were intended as holiday shoes. Had to buy a pair at a local store last minute that were, indeed, true to size. Will be returning."
2.0,I bought this dress in green and white. I couldn't get it to zip. I was so angry because I was supposed to wear it to a wedding. Neither dress zipped. Its such a beautiful dress.
2.0,"Too small, ordered a large"
2.0,For someone with really small arms. Not really stretchy material.
2.0,"This looked super tacky when I got it. The pattern on the sleeves is stamped in plastic - I probably didn't read the description properly, but I was not expecting funny smelling rubber sleeves. It went right back."
2.0,It's pretty fragile and didn't last long at all. It wasn't worth the money I spent.
2.0,I've sent a review in 4 separate times for these. Stop asking me to review them. The large is sized to big compared to other slipper like this on Amazon. The medium fit my daughter good but was to small and still to wide for me. Had to send mine back. My daughter liked her medium black and white ones. The purple and white ones were very pretty and vibrant but it's a larger large
2.0,"It’s absolutely no way to wear top the way how it made . I bought size M . Breast  area on top too high it looks so ridiculous and tight , but waist area too lose and no belly support"
2.0,"Blouse was cute, but way too small.  Sizes are not US sizes, so I ordered a size up.  XL fit like a small."
2.0,Not satisfied with the dress but i will keep it to encourage me to loss weight
2.0,"It's a cute pattern but the fit is awful. I had to return because it was too big and I got a small. Also, the material is just kind of weird, but I guess that's my fault for not looking at the material."
2.0,"As I wore it, it would roll, and the back side would show."
2.0,"This is a cute style dress, and I liked the colors, but everything else about it is just wrong. The material is a very thick, very cheap feeling polyester. I usually wear a 16 and bought the XXL based on the size chart and it was still a little too tight. I probably should have sized up because it didn't fit right in the shoulders--they bunched up a bit. The dress also had many loose strings hanging from it, and the belt loops were very poorly sown on. As another review mentioned, it was also very short. I am only 5'3&#34; and usually a dress that is a mini-dress on someone else comes down to just above my knees. This was a mini-dress on me for sure. I can't imagine how short if would be on someone with shorter legs. I will be returning it."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress.  The purple color is beautiful, and the fabric is a soft rayon. I first ordered it in a large (my normal size). It fit, but the thin fabric was a little more clingy than my curves liked. Also, one of the side seam pockets was sewn in upside down!! Seems like it wouldn't matter, but it made the dress hang funny as well as making that pocket ridiculously small/awkward. I decided to reorder it in an XL, hoping I would like the fit better, and that the mis-sewn pocket was an isolated goof. NOPE! I did like the fit of the XL better, but it STILL had one upside pocket. I realize this is an inexpensive, China made dress, but I just couldn't deal with that issue. So, both dresses went back :("
2.0,Very small great for a child or someone with a tiny head. I have a normal sized head lol but seriously it was like you like and not at all what I pictured. I really wanted that cat eye vintage look.
2.0,Ordered an extra large thinking my husband could have them if I didn't like them. My hand measures a large on the chart's. They were big enough but the seams must be very small or the stitching to close.
2.0,"Meh....  Thin, lightweight, questionable quality.  I returned it."
2.0,The item was too small though I ordered one size bigger than measurement stated. DID NOT FIT... chest way too small arm width not large enough. I followed size chart and added.... it should have fit for price!
2.0,"Fitted tee shirt, not at all like photo.  I am 5' 11&#34; and about 130 lbs.  Ordered extra large and it fits but not flowing as on model.  Shipping took quite a long while.  For the price I can wear it to do yard work in the summer heat.  Cheap looking ."
2.0,"These run SUPER SMALL!!  Both the pair I bought for my daughter and the pair I bought for my son were too small for their feet and I had already sized up when I purchased them! Other then the sizing issue, they seem to be well made for the price.  I will order some more sizes and see."
2.0,"I have been wearing silk tee  shirts everyday every winter since I have been living in New England. And this is the stiffest ""silk"" that I have ever owned. A simple job of trying to tuck the tee unto jeans is a major job. Never even thought about it with other silk tees. I guess that you get what you pay for. A little bit more money is worth it. Who needs a cardboard silk shirt?"
2.0,My wife and I bought the orange and purple versions of this bag and they barely lasted one trip. We took them to Japan in December and both of them broke in transit by the wheels. We ended up having to get them replaced by the airline. I'd say don't waste your money.
2.0,Cheap but decent
2.0,"I loved the fabric. However, after washing it, the black fabric stained the white fabric. Now the white just looks dirty! Not happy at all!"
2.0,"These yoga socks are really cute and the elastic bands are comfortable, but the bottoms aren't very sticky. My feet kept slipping during Pure Barre class. They're fine to wear around the house when I would rather be barefoot but not for Barre class."
2.0,The shows are way too big. It suggested going bigger so kiddo can wear them for awhile but my daughter won't fit into these this season.
2.0,I ordered a medium so they would fit respectfully.  They were big in the waist and I am a size 6.  I gave them away
2.0,"Pants are waaaaay small, ordered a l/xl and I’d be surprised if these were a medium."
2.0,"Nothing like the photo. Fabric is thin. Shirt was misshapen. Wanted to wear it to the office, but this is more of a tshirt than a work shirt."
2.0,Fit a little larger than expected. Poor quality fabric & not sewn together well.
2.0,Will return! Too small and material seems cheap.
2.0,The material is very thin and too light to provide compression even if it fit tightly which it did not. Very disappointed as the reason I got them was for the compression. I was also hoping the compression and the material would be heavy enough not to require a bra it is too light to provide either the support or coverage. It is just a nice light weight shirt. The length is good.
2.0,Very pretty but the bill of the hat is oddly long.
2.0,Well all I can say that it didn’t fit or flattering as I saw. As I know everyone body is different.
2.0,"I wanted to love it! Just not what I wanted or expected. The chain and clasp broke the next day, and the stone is more like polished glass. I was hoping the quartz would have more of a unique personality, instead of a perfect manufactured look."
2.0,Too long and too tight. Only fits tall skinny girls
2.0,Cute earring but the face is creepy.
2.0,Buy only if you enjoy ironing. Wrinkle Release product probably not adequate for all the wrinkles after one wash.
2.0,"stones fell off, a few so not well made."
2.0,"In the past I've gotten these and they were great.. I recently went to buy them again and I can only assume they are made much more cheaply. I bought 2 pair back to back and they both broke with no trauma around the lense within 24 hours. After the first pair I thought maybe I just got a faulty set I'll give it another chance. First pair just popped on my face, second I set down after the first day. Woke up and the we're broken around the lense again. Sad I really liked them but obviously I don't see it worth the risk for a 3rd pair. Be warned"
2.0,"Photo on the left is what was sent to me. My size is 2xL, I ordered and received a 3XL, that fits too close for comfort and drapes down to my knees.  The photo on the right is what's listed in your advertisement. It is a different shade of brown and is about 6"" shorter.  I placed the order based on the advertised jacket. Nice product, but not what I had hoped for."
2.0,the colour wasn't as rich as what was advertised. a dull and dirty looking beige/brown bag. I like the separated compartments but it is also a very busy bag with the additional loop for closure. Half the time i don't bother to zip up the two inner compartments as it is too much to get into for quick access.
2.0,Product was folded up in the package and this caused it to be shaped strangely. The forehead and cheeks don't lay the way they should.
2.0,These don't have a good clamp or fastener system. But good leather.
2.0,Very misleading product descriptions. I ordered two sizes larger than I'd normally wear and they say stretchy. This fabric has no stretch at all. I will be returning these.
2.0,"Its definitely comfortable, that's probably the only positive thing. The material is like a cheap stretchy faux silk fabric. So it definitely keeps you cool.<br />Bought an XL<br />I'm 5.3' (just shy of an elf) and due to my cancer and autoimmune disease, steroids have made my weight just shy of a baby hippo.<br />Short, stubby and about 190<br />The shirt took light years to get here, I had it sitting in the bag still waiting to be washed. Well an emergency occurred and I was being rushed off to the hospital but needed clothes quick (because a night slip isn't in the E.R. dress code)<br />You guessed it, I reached for that black big over sized shirt sitting there in the bag. Thought that will be comfortable enough to sit and watch paint dry in the hospitals emergency room wait area. Threw it on over some leggings, grabbed an overnight bag because I know the drill.<br /><br />After the paint dried I was finally called back. The doctor and nurse are examining me and I get asked the ultimate question ""why are your hands and fingernails black"" as I drew concerned thinking something was seriously wrong, it hit me! This dang shirt that I didn't have time to wash before frantically throwing it on for my hospital debut.<br /><br />Fast forward 17 days later finally home from the hospital, I had to wash this shirt immediately before it caused an epidemic turning my already dull life, black & grey.<br /><br />*watching more paint dry........<br /><br />The black hole is now fresh. I hand washed it, because I didn't need it infecting the rest of the load.<br />Laid it flat to dry, for fear it would shrink more then the asian womans measurement chart.<br /><br />Excited to retry it back on now that I was in  less of a hurry. I put it on, one arm at a time like most people and somehow it has now shrunk. Scratching my head with my again black fingers as to how that's possible, the only logical explanation I could come up with is. The shirt is made only for the wicked witch with special fabric that also shrinks when it gets wet.<br /><br />Conclusion: Pass on this shirt, unless you are a witch. In that case make sure you size up 2 times, and get yourself some flying monkey's."
2.0,"Mixed feelings about product.<br /><br />The first pair we received was unusable.  The inside glove was sewn incorrectly so that 2 fingers on the right hand didn't have anyplace to go.  Amazon was great with the return.<br /><br />The gloves were bought for a 7 1/2-year old who is normal size.  I therefore, purchased the 6-7 size.  They are too big.  There is a good 1/2 inch at the end of the fingers.<br /><br />My 7-year-old son LOVED the gloves, so I was willing to try a second time.<br /><br />The second pair was sewn correctly.<br /><br />I ended up re-ordering the 6-7 size.  The first time I ordered, it was single digit temperatures outside and my son's current gloves had holes in them.  I was looking to immediately replace them, but the stores were already stocking summer stuff.  By the time I re-ordered, the temperatures were in the 40's and 50's.  I decided since he loved them, I'd order with the intent that he could use them next year.  So, I can't speak to how to properly order for size.<br /><br />The other disappointment was that they don't glow-in-the-dark as indicated.  I didn't check the first pair because I was so unhappy that they didn't fit.<br /><br />If I would do it all over again, I would not have let my son see them until I checked them out.  And I would not have bought them."
2.0,Did not like the fit. They kept sliding down.
2.0,The shirt is way too small usually wear an XL which is loose bought this in XXL and it was tight! The sequins are also itchy as hell!
2.0,"Second time around with this type of Michael Kors purse. The first one did the exactly same thing with the straps. Guess I was trying to give the benefit of the doubt buying a 2nd one. Straps started tearing apart with the first couple of months wearing. For the costs of these purses, the quality should be much better."
2.0,This will work if you are a 28-32 sized bra...they literally just send extenders which provides inaccurate cup sizing. Its super cute and worth the cost if you are smaller.
2.0,Necklace showed up broken. Not very good quality at all
2.0,The sweat shirts was too short but they fit everywhere else!!  Such a shame!!  My husband really liked them!!  Will not bother to<br />Order anymore shirts online!!!
2.0,"This shirt was an oarnge red, and was tight."
2.0,Their very loose and the material Is itchy. Don’t understand how they have so many five star reviews. Shipping was fast
2.0,"It's shirt, just not for me.  If you have a butt, it fits a little odd.  I think if you are thin it would look good but if you have a fuller figure it doesn't work."
2.0,"Weird, unexpected thick material - i thought these would be a soft/silky kind of material but they were stiff and stuck straight out, making my hips looks very wide"
2.0,Love the socks but the tread began peeling off the first day!  So for that reason I can not recommend this product
2.0,The material seemed nice and comfy but I ordered a small and medium and both were too large. I am 5'2 150 usually wear an 8 pants. It was also too long but that was probably to be expected.
2.0,"Disappointed. The shirts were very thin. Have to wear bras that match the shirt- and on some of them- even if you do, depending on the type of bra your nipples can be seen.(the old saying- your headlights are on)."
2.0,I ordered a ex large was so small and the style was different from the one on the model
2.0,Sleeves were EXTREMELY long.... Did not come off my shoulder just isn't for me.
2.0,Loved it. The reason I’m giving 2 stars is because it didn’t come with the belt and that was what would have made the dress!
2.0,"Read expecting more like royal blue, instead it is more of a powder blue"
2.0,"This may be my personal preference, but I like retainers that are harder as I tend to bite my piercings a bit, these are really squishy and become warped and sharp even if you don't bite them. They dig into and cut my piercing holes, 4 broke on day 1, and all the rest the head fell off. 10 of these last me 2 days, when before I've had 4 that have last me 3 years (I have 4 lip piercings). And I only got 10 instead of 12.<br /><br />Terrible durability, extremely uncomfortable, you can get better ones for only a bit more, it says you get 12 but I only got 10, and the shipping on mine was delayed so I had to take my piercings out entirely during work for a few days."
2.0,This is a pretty top. Not what I had expected. It's a little on the cheap side in how the material looks and feels.
2.0,"Very poor quality. As you can see in the second photo, what I assume is hot glue, coming through the fabric. Just not well put together.  And not impressed with the overall look of this dress. Unfortunately, will be returning."
2.0,"Be sure to note that there is a white design on one side of the dress- you can't tell in photos because the models hair is in the way. You can slightly see it on the picture with the purse. I wasn't aware this was there. The zipper also was broken so I had to return. If the design wasn't there, I would have kept the dress."
2.0,"Sweater is too wide for any normal sized human being. When it was washed, it shrank vertically, but it stayed the same width, making it even worse. The only reason it got a 2 star is because it is a nice material, just the sizing is horrible"
2.0,It is beautiful first few min. Then it picks up wrinkles fast.  Blended material.
2.0,Purchased for my wife. Says she is not happy. Thought they would be darker.
2.0,"Material is super thin, I bought a size bigger and it was way too small (Asian sizing). But it was very short, being 5’1”, it went mid thigh! Wouldn’t recommend"
2.0,Bought 2 of these.  Had to return one.  Not very comfortable and open on the sides and not approved<br />by many places.  I was asked to use cloth face mask under it.  Really defeated the purpose.
2.0,I got the for posy op tummy tuck. In aa few months. We will see.
2.0,"I love the style; like the color but in oh Etsy the fabric is too thin, if you made this in a better fabric ( heavier) with more color options, I would buy it.  I almost sent it back because the fabric is so see through.<br /><br />Thank your u for asking. Great STYLE.<br /><br />PAT"
2.0,"Too small the size, they must devise a better way to sell because the information they provide is bad."
2.0,I had tried some Fruit of the Loom 2XL boxers and they were a little too small.  I couldn't find any 3XL Fruit of the Loom boxers so I decided to try the 3XB Fruit of the Loom boxers.  They turned out to be too big in the waist and too small in the thighs.  I washed them to see if the waist would shrink them at all.  It didn't help.
2.0,Tight around the arms and does not drape down to my calf/ankles like the photos indicate.
2.0,Item leaked out of box and went all over my house. Will not ordered again.
2.0,"NO WAY TO HANG CLOTHING, WELL BUILT BUT , THE BAG IS VERY WELLBUILT , BUT LIKE I SAID NO WAY TO HANG CLOTHING,<br />NO LOOPS OR HOOKS !"
2.0,Did not suit my needs.
2.0,"The bows came off after a couple wears. They're still super sparkley, and my daughter loves them, but it's a big bummer the bows all came off."
2.0,"Although it was very pretty, it was way too large for my frame.  Also, I ordered white.  When I opened the package, the color was actually off-white or pale yellow.  When I contacted the seller, they said they don't have a true white.  I was really disappointed.  But, the seller was easy to work with."
2.0,"This strap is shorter than nato’s I have purchased from other companies, just enough that I cannot tuck the excess. Also the quality of manufacture is not as big as straight s I paid significantly less for...  I returned the strap!"
2.0,"I love the design of the bag.  It would receive a 5-star rating from me, except that the zippers are not well made.  I returned the bag about a month after I purchased it because the front zipper compartment broke.  Since I am a fan of the design, I exchanged it for another one.  That one lasted less than three months and the zipper broke again and I can't return it.  Therefore, I do not recommend this bag."
2.0,"A couple of things before I break it down for you: 1) I have a background in men's fashion (editorial & marketing for 10+years). I don't consider myself a fashionist-o (frugal and hate shopping, but vain enough to want to look nice). 2) Amazon is my everything as I love a bargain, a  great find/deal/steal, and if I find something I love, I buy 10 of them.<br /><br />This is a perfect cardigan! ... for your 6-year-old nephew (when you want to get him something fancy and fashionable, but it's not really made for a man, and you won't feel guilty in two weeks when said nephew has destroyed it). Oh! I forgot one thing... it WOULD be great only IF the price were $15-17.99, and not $35 dollars.<br /><br />Why? The knit is so lightweight it has no shape or structure. And because there are no buttons to button it closed, you can't even fake shape/structure.  It feels and looks cheap (very much unlike the image attached in the advertisement). It's just NOT what you're wanting. And if you're unsure of what you're wanting, you're not wanting this for this price... unless you really have some money to toss around or you want something like this specifically for some purpose rare to adult humans.<br /><br />Now... I will say, it's soft and comfy. But so is the floor if ya wear a sleeping bag, ya know? ...  If i was in the shower, and the doorbell rang, I'd feel very fashionable tossing this on, still soaking wet, to answer the door (obviously, still holding the glorified robe shut in order to not flash the person at the door because, again, it has no buttons). And i'm borderline on sending this back for one reason:  it's a body cover made of yarn that's nice for around the house and it serves that purpose perfectly. But for 35 american units of money? .... I feel like my wallet has been physically violated and has been left to shake, cold, alone, in a corner, without a Penny in sight to cuddle against for comfort and warmth.<br /><br />Boooooooooo!"
2.0,Not the color or pattern as shown
2.0,"I was very disappointed with the value of this item; hollow-backed and very light weight. I ordered this one because of all the negative reviews of other similar motifs, and did not have time to do a return. Item was shipped and delivered in a timely fashion; I simply waited too long to shop."
2.0,"It's from China. It takes a month to get here. When it came I was not happy, it was very small and not as good as it appeared online"
2.0,the silver ring is painted. It did not last one day. Since this is the only reason I bought this set I was very disapointed.
2.0,This was not very flattering on me! I’m 5’5 about 150lbs and wanted something that was flowy since I’ve had 3 kids! I got the medium and it was a great length but too wide for my body. There was about 4 extra inches near my waist where I wish it had hugged me better. I ended up returning it because of the fit and the weird white line at the top of the dress.
2.0,"Bought this in October for a Christmas gift.  The beautiful blue coating had a little spot peeling off by the handle when we opened it brand new.  The coating is continuing to peel.  Unfortunately, I did not try to return this sooner, but being it was a Christmas gift bought in October, it was over the 30 days with Amazon. The Seller said I had to go thru Amazon, they could not help me either.<br />It's a beautiful, sturdy product.  But if you have a problem, needs to resolve in less than the 30 days."
2.0,The strap is way too short.  Disappointing.  Cute otherwise.
2.0,The top isn't ideal for smaller chests. No matter how tight I tied the front the material was so stretchy that I couldn't get a good secure fit. And it seems the tighter you tie it ( despite it not loking right I the front) the back of the top rides up your back and doesn't stay put. I would say if you are an A or B cup to avoid this swim suit. The bottoms did fit well tho.
2.0,Didn't hold up.  After 6 mos it came apart
2.0,It would have been nice if I could have ordered the pants separately. The pants were to big. Now I have to spend more money to have them fixed.
2.0,The hole in the croth is much larger then show. Besides that it was a good fit.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:f0b0c8e7fd9f16e988d31458de94c95a]] Great look, idea and inspiration. How ever bad execution. Love these kinds of bracelets because they don't hurt or pull to get on. But these have the reinforcement for the key chain make them too snug and uncomfortable for the average women/adult. Great for kids!"
2.0,"The size ran small, I wish I had gotten a size larger.  It also had a label for a health advisory for the State of California, saying it may cause cancer or birth defects, not to ingest, which was a little unsettling."
2.0,The material was strange
2.0,Awesome looking watch. The reason I returned it was because the second hand acted as the chronograph second hand and the second hand on the chronograph was the actual second hand. I would have loved to keep this was but what a HUGE flaw.
2.0,"It sheds a lot, and the seams are ripping quick"
2.0,I love the fact that the glasses are two toned. But I expected them to be shades or actual sunglasses. Instead they’re just tinted glasses and don’t block out sunlight at all.
2.0,Liked it but ran too small
2.0,The colors are not as bright as expected.  Does fit well though.
2.0,The fabric was very flimsy.  Dress did not arrive looking like the one in the picture.
2.0,"Too small like the other dress I bought with it, and the material was spongy feeling and clung to your skin."
2.0,"nice top -- just is much smaller than typical sizing, and i ordered TWO sizes larger than my size!"
2.0,The magnetic strip doesn’t stick well
2.0,Let me start off by saying I LOVE this shirt.. That why I was so disappointed about how uneven the hemline is. Seriously? I'm so upset because I really love the design of the shirt but the execution is terrible.
2.0,"The dress arrived however, it was apparent that this dress wasn’t new and it had a stain.  I’m not fond of  the material used to make this dress.  Very disappointed."
2.0,It a tight and stretchy material.  Made for shapely ladies.
2.0,"Sent back. Too long and baggy at M. For the price, just spring for REAL equestrian attire which will last longer anyway."
2.0,"They looked great online but I was disappointed when I got them. Didn't pay a lot for them, so I guess I got what I paid for. Very cheap looking doubt I'll ever wear them."
2.0,I just got this not even a month and it broke off already! Going to try to fix it????
2.0,Material itchy
2.0,"Quality was okay. Fabric felt like those swimsuits we used to wear as kids from walmart, but slightly thicker. My main issue with this dress was the fact that the dye is basically only on the top layer of the fabric, so when you stretch it you can see the white in between the seams. So if you are busty like I am, the part that covers your boobs is a lighter color than the rest of the dress. My boob size isn't changing so I returned it."
2.0,The zippers were both broken.I returned the purse.The return process is very easy!
2.0,Wish it had ring size
2.0,Bubble gum jewelry
2.0,They run really big.  Three of us tried them on and although two of us have big heads they wouldn’t stay up.
2.0,Cute but fit really strange around the neck line it was really loose bulky and felt like it was sewed wrong because this I don't wear it :( it pretty much just hangs in a large lump around shoulders and u can't bend over cause everyone would see your tah tahs.  Too bad I've liked everything else I've ordered from alegra k but this one was a fail. I gave it 2 stars just because I like allegra k and how they make sizes that actually fit American women.
2.0,"I like the product, but half of them were already broken upon delivery. I'm cautious about ordering with this company again."
2.0,"Way bigger than I thought they would be!  Will use them for Halloween.  Very pretty detail, but really heavy."
2.0,I had to return the dress. It was super cute and looked good until you get closer and realize that it is paper thin and you can see through the dress. You'd have to wear a dark slip underneath but that causes bulk. I saw the other posts that it was very thin material but thought I could wear something underneath but that didn't look good. I so wish this had worked out.
2.0,"I'm busty but take between a large and xlarge in shirts, a large in bottoms. hourglass shape. The XL top is skin tight all over and uncomfortable. I don't mind form fitting things but this is too tight. Otherwise it's nice material, very soft on the body though it's ribbed, and washes very well even if washed in warm water. (the fit was tight before I washed it and didn't change)."
2.0,"Father's day gift and it's too tight and not returnable!  5&#34;9&#34;  200 lbs XL,"
2.0,"Quality of these is comparable to something you'd see at F21. Not the best and definitely more on the costumes side. For the quality I think you could find earrings such as these for less elsewhere. But if you're in a pinch, the different shapes offer nice variety and if anything they make good backups."
2.0,Metal piece fell off of the side which made my glasses super streched. Luckily i had an old pair and took the metal piece off of it to super glue on these. Besides that the price is great and the frames havent had any further issues since.
2.0,Beautiful lace fabric but way way too tight and short. I’m 5’6” and typically wear a large (10/12).
2.0,I bought the Amethyst. They were smaller than I expected and the color is nothing like the picture. The picture is so pretty. Mine are so dark they don't look like Amethyst or even purple. I'm disappointed.
2.0,"I was disappointed with the return options for this dress.  The quality is good, just a much wider fit and fall than I thought it would be. I maybe would have liked it better it I was pregnant, but there is so much full fabric it looks really wide and round on me.  I’m 5’6” 125lbs. The return option isn’t worth the effort so I now have a dress I won’t wear and am out my money."
2.0,Simply nice and so far it's good. Comfortable and matching for most kinds of cloths. So far so good and would to purchase one more if required.<br /><br />Edited: Reduce the star rating as it didn't last for long.
2.0,remote does not work
2.0,Poor quality material.  I bought it in black and it's a shiny material as well.
2.0,"Unfortunately the underwear were way too small.  I ordered the size my son normally wears, but the fit was very tight.  I will be making a return."
2.0,this shirt is too heavy. thought it was going to be more lightweight. many users are moving off these heavier shirts for the new generation lighter shirts. wish i would have gone that direction.
2.0,mask is worthless metal cage no filtration
2.0,Really nice soft material...  I ordered a large and returned the product because of the cut. If I would have put the seam under the breat area where it should have been I would have been exposing myself.  I am a D cup if that helps any of you looking at this product. I was super bummed cause if it wasn't for that area not fitting right I would have kept it.  I just really have a hard time wearing dresses with a seam line running in the wrong spot.
2.0,Very comfortable and nice that you can adjust the straps.<br />But I only had them for roughly 4 months and one strap clip already broke on one. Other then that they work good.<br />Update another strap clip broke so now I'm down to the 4 . Comfortable but cheap material
2.0,"It came very late. Around the arm hole area, it is big and doesn’t lay correctly. The material is a little sheer."
2.0,"The fit is perfect, but they are cheaply made. There’s a hole & yellow stains. For $30 bucks, these were not worth it. Check your local beauty supply store for a pair."
2.0,This does not match the measurements provided at all. Horribly sewn--all totally crooked seams. Ridiculously tight at the shoulders because the sleeves aren't sewn on correctly. Not worth the price. I am still considering reordering a size up just because I really want a jacket in this style and I can't find any others like it...
2.0,"The only thing I don’t like about this top, is that it’s see through."
2.0,Were too tight on my face!
2.0,"These shoes sounded great, and look really cute. However, they seem small for the size and my daughter won't wear them anymore because they hurt/gave her blisters. The back strap has a &#34;cushion&#34; attached that seems to be the culprit - too narrow and stiff, and makes the shoes more uncomfortable than they should be."
2.0,"Not too crazy about this.  It's not as universal as it seems - the hoodie would be a STRETCH as a style... literally.  You have to pull it up and over your head along w/the rest of the shirt, so the neck seam is basically floating at the nape of your neck, and the shirt looks ridiclous.  (I don't have a long torso, I'm 5'1&#34;.)  Also, definitely going to have to employ the use of a belt or something with this, otherwise it looks like maternity wear.<br />2 stars for fabric - it's stretchy, and super soft."
2.0,returned these
2.0,"Even though this is obviously fake and cheap it’s pretty, and I love rose gold which is an option and so I had to get it. However a “jewel” fell off while I was making dinner so I would say it is fragile lol."
2.0,"These are exactly what you get at a spa during various treatments. They are individually wrapped with the size written real big for everyone to see.  Embarrassing? Yeah.  I was hoping more for travel underwear like Onederwear, which are packed even smaller and the size a small label on the right side of the inside of the underwear....so nobody but you will know the size. Onederwear is much more comfortable and pretty so I am going right back to them.  As for these disposables, I plan on donating them to a local day spa. I sure won’t ever use them."
2.0,Beautiful. ..however the charm hangs too close to the moon. Also when I received it the circle was bent.
2.0,I have very thin. silky hair.  They slid off my worse then any of the others I have tried.<br />Returned.
2.0,"Great concept, adorable socks. However, sock “1” had a hole in it within 3 hours! I’m so disappointed."
2.0,I intended on ordering again but the clips broke 😭 I wanna give it another chance but I’m still on the fence about it.
2.0,"Gorgeous color, bit fit 2 sizes too small."
2.0,"So I ordered the tye-dye one with hopes that it was going to be as pretty as the dress on the first picture.... DO NOT TRUST THE FIRST PICTURE! The dresses look NOTHING like that.. swipe to see the second picture. I’ve had this dress for a while, just can’t bring myself to wear it. Don’t like the style or the color/pattern. I was hoping for that first picture dress... so disappointing!"
2.0,This dress was made from cheap material. I returned it.
2.0,Not as advertised. The material looks cheap too
2.0,The fitting was not great at all. I ended up returning this.
2.0,The jewels fell out after 2 months and its past its return time
2.0,"The dress was too big, didn't like the fit. Gave it away."
2.0,"Fit was fine, material was not. You have to wear something under this, more than a bra. It is see through."
2.0,THE middle zipper broke the first time I used it.  Not pleased with that at all.
2.0,The tip of the drop is super sharp and pokes me when I bend I over. Otherwise it’s really cute!
2.0,"This band is very loose on your wrist and it is very hard to tighten. Even when you do get it tightened, it comes loose throughout the day. The material is nice and it is very lightweight."
2.0,As cute as these are there is no way they would stay on someone's wrist unless they have larger arms/hands. Disappointed.
2.0,"READ WHOLE REVIEW- Love this dress's style and how it looks on me but don't be fooled. It was shipped to me already falling apart it came with a missing button and pulls everywhere and usually a company will send you a dress that is steamed and looks nice, I should know I work in the fashion industry, but they did not have the curtesy to do even that. The dress fits very well on me but I was also sent the wrong color and after using it once it looks like the material is falling apart. Will not buy from this company again cheaply made."
2.0,"Beware, these fit like booty shorts. Not great for little girls IMO"
2.0,As soon as I opened the package the stone in one of the earrings fell out. I’m not upset because I only needed one earring anyhow. I’m adding it to a bridal garter. I got what I wanted for what I paid.
2.0,"First of al I thought this was suppose to be a long dress and not a two piece..I Got the pink and blue outfit,Small size. The skirt fits fine ,very long even at me being 5'9 but the blouse is not as expected. It is huge!.<br />Very disappointed and will return"
2.0,Not clear like in the description. Looks nothing like the picture. Seems to have a crack. Maybe an optical illusion.
2.0,I find it hard to put links together. Cute though.
2.0,"Quality isn’t as good, you get what you pay for"
2.0,Pouch is too small and poorly designed. I had to add a &#34;snap&#34; to keep the pouch closed.
2.0,I didn’t like the splits in the sides.
2.0,"this would be fantastic if it fit true to size, it was waaaaaaaaay to small and you could hear the fabric ripping trying to get it on, and when you did get it on, it squished the life out of my girls.. sooo disappointing, I would say the XL would fit a medium on the smaller side. WIll not be buying again"
2.0,runs really small and the zipper is cheap made
2.0,SHORT. I looked for ages to find a shirt that looked long enough to fit a plus sized 30 something. THIS IS NOT IT.
2.0,Didn't fit a large suitcase. Lock is just a snap close.
2.0,"Just received these sunglasses. And I should have known better reading the reviews, they showed up cracked."
2.0,order at least 2 sizes larger for a normal fit
2.0,Wanted to like this skirt but it fits awkward....does not look like the pic.
2.0,Looked to be good quality I hit my watch on my car door and it detected almost immediately it wasnt even a hard tap.
2.0,"Cool watch, but my son got it wet on the second day he had it. It no longer works."
2.0,Waste of money considering I don't fit in after the 2nd wash.
2.0,"I bought this for my dad for Christmas. He owns a Breitling Super Avenger. As much as we played with the winder, we could not get it to mount. Upon calling Brookstone, they said &#34;oh yeah, it won't fit that watch&#34;. Perhaps a disclaimer on the site would have been helpful. Product was nice quality, but not right for us."
2.0,Solo lo use una vez y sele perdió la luna
2.0,The fit was odd and not consistent between the colors. The waist band did not provide tummy control. Items were returned.
2.0,"The picture of this dress is not accurate. The dress is super long, about 4'' past my knee. It's also rather form fitting, rather than a fit and flare style depicted in the photo. Since return shipping isn't covered, I have to eat the cost now. Super disappointed."
2.0,"Although the purse is gorgeous, when I recieved it, every jewel along the top had fallen out. They were all in the bag and I superglued them back on just because I don't have time to send it back and order a different one. Dissappointed."
2.0,very cheap thin fabric
2.0,The pendant was not colored in all the way with the black enamel and I could not use it for the gift that I had planned. Very unsatisfying.
2.0,"The cufflinks were as expected, but one of them broke after not much use. Bummer."
2.0,"I don’t normally post reviews, but this belt is not worth the money. Bought this belt in the army June. 6 months later the leather has cracked and beginning to peel off the belt. Additionally, there is now some new tear in the belt material."
2.0,It were ok not to my expectation kinda of small but am utilizing it
2.0,"Took a long time to receive this product, I should have looked better at the pictures because I couldn’t tell that these are bell bottoms! Also I’m 5’2 got the size small and the length of these are super long! Even with high heels I’d still be stepping on them. Price is also expensive for the quality they look like more like something you can buy on the streets of LA for $20<br />Gonna send back for a refund and hope that dosent take as long as it did to receive this item!"
2.0,They're nice but arrived broken with two pairs missing. Contacted Amazon and received a full refund when I sent them back. I wish they would have worked out.
2.0,The bow is not even attached to the blouse it is a separate sash not sure how this would work . Fabric is scratchy and not soft
2.0,This dress is well printed but it has no shape or curves. Just material in the shape of a large tank top.
2.0,I was hoping it would be larger and more pashmina in style.  It is exactly square and awkward and the material reminds me of fiberglass.
2.0,"I thought it would look different, but it was too big and awkward with the shoulders cut out the way they were."
2.0,"Bought this for my sons chromebook for school daily use, the strap is adjustable buy he keeps making the strap out no matter how many times we shorten it."
2.0,The cut in the ring tends to get tangled up in hair.
2.0,"Dress looks very cheap , but it fits great, so I would suggest using it as a layering piece. Like where a wrap over top. And put some more expensive looking  jewelry  Paired  with the outfit"
2.0,Button was cheap and delivered broken and the skirt is WAY too small!
2.0,Chips were just that...chips...a lot smaller than they looked on picture. Not very well made but I guess the old adage is true...you get what you pay for.
2.0,This t-shirt has a wonderful fabric but the make is off.  The neckline is too high and won't lay flat and the sleeves have an odd shape.  Instead of the sleeve lying flat against my arm it points out as if there is too much material in it.  I ordered the short version but it was pretty much as long as most t-shirts.
2.0,"Too roomy for me.  I also dislike not having an area for change and credit card slots.  I should have stuck to my guns and purchased an organizational handbag.  Biggest complaint is the strap keeps getting twisted and the 2 thicknesses fall either direction making a tangled mess.  I hate straps that when you shorten it for a shoulder bag you end up with double thickness and that drives me nuts.  I already sent back and ordered another with an organization section on front with credit card slots, coin pocket and folding money slot."
2.0,The diamonds are cloudy but that is to be expected by the price. The ring is nothing to get excited about. I should have passed on this ring. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Ir is not what I expected yo be stretched material and see through
2.0,The Suit if you order it go bigger than what they say. The bottoms they sent were like child size and it was def not medium. The top fit fit and . it was cute but the bottoms were too tight. and they did not match the suit. It cost more money to ship it back than to keep it
2.0,"I am disappointed too small, in the picture it was loose fitting."
2.0,Started loosing its color after 3 wears
2.0,"I loved this set!! I received so many compliments when I wore it. I know it’s costume jewelry, but after wearing it only once, it turned black! I was so surprised and disappointed. I’d like to order another one, but I’m checking into how I can keep it “golden” for a longer period of time."
2.0,returned as dint like the quality & fit. Although the zipper & length was nice..
2.0,These things are huge. neat but huge.
2.0,It was not what I expected it did not fit well at all made poorly
2.0,"They are very warm and comfortable. Unfortunately the graphics are not done well. Mine were worn twice, then washed, and after you can barely see the images. You probably get what you pay for with these. They were fun for a couple of days, and now they’re going to be donated or thrown out."
2.0,Really cheaply made and thin. Would never buy again
2.0,They were cute and cheap. Emphasis on cheap.
2.0,Very thin and cheaply made. A lot smaller then I expected
2.0,Not good for motorcycle riding
2.0,Too tight. Great fabric but wished I would have ordered a size up.
2.0,Size up! No stretch in them
2.0,This shirt is too wide and too short... Dos not fit well
2.0,"Not at all flattering unless you have the perfect build. It was so horrible it was cringe worthy. It is the weight of a light tshirt material (Jersey knit) and it shows EVERYTHING. You can see every dimple, curve, ripple that you have. You wouldn't have known they were there until putting this dress on and looking! It is slightly sheer too so you have to wear something underneath but unless you are wearing a full body spanx I dont know what wouldnt show. The straps are wide and unflattering. There is an odd ""V"" that they stitched in the center front and a terrible center back seam that runs the full length of the dress.<br /><br />This was one of the worst dresses I purchased off of Amazon yet. It is just a poor design and not suitable for many body types."
2.0,The shoes ripped open at the toe seam the first day I put them on. She didn’t even have them on more than an hour and I noticed the whole. Poorly made but I guess you get what you pay for. I just needed some new gold shoes for picture day.
2.0,Crooked and sharp/pointy edges earrings. Don’t waste your money on these
2.0,This is soooo cute but it broke within a couple days
2.0,The fabric is flimsy and the white shirt had the red dye rub off on it and it did not wash out. I ordered way too big and they were small..They were a disappointment.
2.0,Chain broke literally as i was taking out of the packaging. didnt get a chance to wear it
2.0,"Weird fabric, color was off"
2.0,"After one use , it started coming apart :("
2.0,"Way smaller than it should have been, it fit like a small. I ordered a xl"
2.0,Lasted about a week before stitching broke. Had to return. Don't waste your time
2.0,Unfortunately this pair has developed a hole at the toe area and have only worn them three times.  I've just missed the return window so it looks like I'm stuck with them until they become unwearable.  It's a shame because I have another pair that's worn well for a year.  I can no longer recommend these at this price.
2.0,Nice but the fabric isn't what I expected. It's thick polyester which will be too warm to wear during warmer weather.
2.0,"I bought size 100cm (2-3yr) for my daughter who is almost 2 and wears a 3t. I think she will be able to wear it when she's about 6 or 7. But, hey it's cute!"
2.0,"It's really a cute little shirt, but due to the EXTREME size discrepancy, and the fact that my daughter had to give it to a friend right off the bat, I'm giving it a bad rating.  We purchased a size 14, but they should've sold it as a 6-8."
2.0,"Not thrilled :(  Love the look of these shoes, but not nearly as comfortable as my past Air Max's.  For the cost, I'd shop for something else.  Had high hopes, but alas, ...  Not nearly as supportive, lack any arch, and honestly, not very soft.  I couldn't wait to get home and take them off after wearing them all day.  Disappointed."
2.0,The 1st time I wore it I woke up gasping for air after dreaming that I was being suffocated.<br />I haven't worn it again since.<br /><br />The inner surface is rough and irritating to my skin.  Even with the Velcro adjusted as large as possible it fits very tight.  Maybe that is how it is supposed to function but it was not very comfortable.
2.0,Does not look like pic at all
2.0,Too gaudy
2.0,Beautiful but needs to be better fabric! I wore this only one day at a party - by the end of the night the right leg seam ripped from just moving around! It would be nice if the fabric had more of a stretch to it!
2.0,"Cons:<br />Deceptive imagery makes the bag look bigger. I measured it and compared with the listed measurements and it is definitely smaller. Being made in China, I'm not sure if this really had quality-assurance as two side straps were already disconnected upon delivery and thus useless.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Held up to about 20 pounds of books and items being lugged across Australia, and the neck strap never broke! ALSO, LOTS OF POCKETS! Probably the best feature.<br /><br />I wish the bag were bigger though, as well as the little accessory pouch. I couldn't even fit a regular water bottle inside it."
2.0,"Why are the cups so needlessly oversized?? I can't get any smaller than the smallest size, so I can't wear this at all. The band size seems accurate; tried two sizes and the band sizes were good, but the cups were too big, BOTH times! It is comfortable material and seems to stay up well, so that's two stars, but the stupid big cups bring it down.  If you have no boobies, I wouldn't recommend"
2.0,Doesn't fit as shown in picture.
2.0,The sleeves are shorter than expected and the hood is smaller than expected.
2.0,Color ok. Material cheap. Fit not great fill full chest DDD
2.0,The color isn’t “grey”. More of a muted light green. Fits way too big. Size down. I got the smallest size available and I won’t be wearing this shirt as it’s unflattering. I’m a 32D and the chest area is still huge.
2.0,Zipper not functional
2.0,Run crazy small. XL is seriously like a small.
2.0,"These are cute on my daughter, but now the Velcro WILL NOT stay put so they are always falling off. I would honestly rather they have a real buckle."
2.0,"The heart tarnished very quickly. The rope cord has a silky feel to it and tends to loosen a bit. This was a gift to my 5 year old. So for the price even tho the heart tarnished, it was more for the idea than the idea of it lasting."
2.0,"I got a Men's size Large, left-hand glove.  I'm hoping it will break in and stretch a bit but overall the size is a bit smaller than other gloves.  Next time I'll spend more money and buy a name brand."
2.0,Definitely not for women
2.0,"Very thin slick material, unpleasant feel to it, seemed very cheap material"
2.0,There needs to be more assorted products.  Not just 12 of per necklace.  Really disappointed
2.0,The jewels don't seem to fit very well in the posts. They keep randomly falling off. The variety of colors is nice though.
2.0,THE POUCH FOR YOUR JUNK IS TOO SMALL FOR YOUR JUNK. TYPICAL OF ASIAN MANUFACTURERS. THEY DESIGN FOR SIZE OF CHIPMUNK JUNK.
2.0,"For the price, I was expecting better quality. I bought these to use as headbands/hairwraps, but they're uneven and don't fold up and tie right. My cheap Walmart bandanas are better made."
2.0,The clip-ons curvature or other characteristic allowed for one lens to contact a spot on my prescription eyeglasses leaving an opaque area.
2.0,The colors were bright and pretty which was nice but the fabric was like a tight plastic type chiffon. Also the chest area was extremely tight and was very unflattering. The shape would have been nice but overall it was a let down.
2.0,Bag is excellent in design but quality control was missed by zipper end twisted so closing zipper were impossible. I had slice threads untwisted then resewed. Didn't to return easy fix.
2.0,"I bought these for my 9yr old, who is on the heavier side for his age, so I got him the 14/16 and they were still too small. They also seem to run on the shorter side."
2.0,I love the stone. The necklace itself is made of rubber that smells so bad I had to put it on a different chain
2.0,"I have ordered several different styles of lined, waterproof, windproof hiking pants in an effort to find one that will keep me warm and dry on the motorcycle during cool weather and still be comfortable to hike in when we get where we are going. I ordered two different sizes in this style and started with the larger Size 32. I am 5'4""/134 lbs. and usually wear a Size 8 in pants. The Size 32 was very tight in the calves and also very long. (and I have thin calves) It was also tight around my hips and felt constrictive. The description said ""stretch"" but I didn't feel much stretch. The WORST thing though was the SMELL! I don't know what chemical they used on the fabric, but I couldn't take them off and shove them back into their bag fast enough. YUK! They are made in China, so I wasn't sure it would even be safe to inhale. Order up a size if you don't want them skin tight and are willing to brave the smell."
2.0,Laces came a part after little use.
2.0,The material sucks I washed it one time and it's fraying.
2.0,"I loved this bag when i saw it, loved the idea..told everyone about it.. Then it fell apart.  I used to back and forth to work to hold my purse and laptop.  the burlap started falling apart and leaving burlap pieces on all my clothes...i tried sewing it to make it last longer, didnt work...better to get a 10$ bag and give the other $50 directly to WFP, with the bag only $20 goes and you end up looking a mess due to the burlap falling apart.  I think mine started falling apart in three months and i wasnt very tough on it...used it for flying a few times but that and work, and i drive to work so it's not like it was doing much more than being toted from the house to the car and from the car to the office.<br /><br />Also, depending on what you are wearing the burlap can make pulls or wear your clothes in spots... thats why i always used the cotton on the outside...plus the cotton print with the 1 is really great looking."
2.0,too small not like picturee
2.0,They don't look anything like the picture.  Very disappointed
2.0,"My wife said they ran way too small, typical Chinese was her response. She wore them once or twice but they just aren't the same as the old Joe Boxer satin underwear she loved from Kmart. She has worm them a few times but that is it. Oh she said there is no cotton in the crotch at all."
2.0,"Love this bag, but have had for about 3 months now and print is wearing off."
2.0,"Ordered a small, size is more like a medium and the inseem is way too long. They have a very cheap feel to them. Probably will return"
2.0,Incorrect listing for size.<br />Far too small to even make it over my size 10 heel.<br />Literally seem to be child's socks.
2.0,"An awkward fitting shirt, to be 100% honest. I actually ordered a size larger than I normally wear because of some experiences with previous orders. And, the larger size did not help much as the shoulders and upper part was quite large while the remaining portion from mid-chest, down... seemed to be either sewn poorly/lack of material cut or something  because it was like it sort of ""telescoped"" . Difficult to describe actually... it went extremely straight down like a tube. Anyway,it looked silly to try and wear this with big, poofy shoulders and a tube type body.<br /> P.S. my body shape is very proportional,  flat tummy,pretty narrow hips. No way would someone with midriff or tummy thickness, much less curvy hips ever wear this! And, those shoulders!! Yikes...<br />Very, very disappointed."
2.0,I found I must order a size larger then I always did AND I have lost weight. The materiel is thinner also. All in all a cheaper version. I consider them disposable!
2.0,The shirt is thick and a good soft material but has a really oversized fit
2.0,The band is nice but the adapter on one side doesn't  latch correctly and has caused the watch to just fall off my arm unexpectedly several times.
2.0,This is a cheap product. bad mistake ordering the glasses. the review made them look good. not true
2.0,This skirt runs extremely small for its sizing. Ordered a XXL and it fit more like a medium (maybe a 10-12 missy). They do include the measurements---I just failed to read them before ordering. I don't know why manufacturers use misleading sizing. So here is the heads up.
2.0,This is cream color not white
2.0,A Again I like these sandals but they were too narrow for my feet I hope to return them for a credit thank you
2.0,The way it looks the connector is not shown. But the 2 rings are in center. So as soon as you put it on ankle the clasp is hanging right there which takes away from the look of the rings. Do not like that at all. Very disappointed cuz otherwise it would have been great
2.0,very cheap and not made well
2.0,"Very cute design, but too small for both my 6 & 8 year old. I would suggest these for ages 3-5."
2.0,"It appears to be vinyl, not leather, am I not correct?  It is quite large for a cellphone bag, plus the cord is very long.  It looks more like a small lady's purse than a cellphone holder.  It is not worth  returning it for the small amount it cost.  The color is of course a matter of taste."
2.0,"Jacket was to small for with it being a medium, felt like it was a small"
2.0,Bra fits okay but the cups slip out or move often. I have washed it several times and one of the cups came out each time and now it has disappeared. I assume its in the dryer Narnia along with some socks
2.0,"11-12 size is way too much of a gap if you are trying to buy new shoes, your child is either an 11 or a 12, you can't buy shoes that are inbetween."
2.0,"When I saw this piece, I was disappointed. It looks very cheap."
2.0,"These glasses are NOT polarized, they’re advertised as polarized so I’m leaving a poor review for incorrect description."
2.0,"My waist is 34 Inches and I am 159 pounds. I expected the large to be just right on me because some of the reviews on here specify to buy a size smaller since its stretchy, but I would advice to buy 2 sizes down.  I am returning the large and going to try out the medium. I'll review again after I recieve that one."
2.0,While the shirt itself looks good the sizes are WAY off. Bought a 2X and it fits more like a medium. Very disappointed.
2.0,broke within 2 days
2.0,Was not as pictured. Our daughter is only 5'5'' and it hit her mid shin. She wanted it to the floor as pictured. We returned it.
2.0,"I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas to put pictures of my spouse and I on both sides for him. He really wanted a picture clip and I thought what the heck, it was a good price & a cute little last minute gift. It arrived later than I expected, 2 days after Christmas & it broke the MOMENT I gave it to him and he opened the clip to put on his keys. Very disappointed."
2.0,"For some reason, this red dress looked great online.  In person, not so much.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />The good news is that this really IS rayon.  It has a beautiful flow to it and looks great in the breeze.  The print is awful.  It just looks really off and I am not a fan of it.  When I saw it online, it did not seem to look this ugly as it does in person.<br /><br />FIT/STYLE<br />I wear a size 14-16 misses US and this fits in XL okay.  The problem is not really the fit, it is the style.  The rope belt set in the casing of the dress is way up high.  That makes it look frumpy.  The sleeves are okay, but not that flattering.  The neck is pretty low, but that can be fixed with an insert.  The ruffle starts up too high and cuts the dress short in proportion.<br /><br />I tried to like this dress and I just can't.  I feel frumpy and dowdy in it.  I do not have an odd figure and look great in a lot of different styles of dresses and clothing.  This dress is not flattering.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This dress looks much better online than it does in reality.  The fabric is off in colors and design, and the style is unflattering.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  I gave it two stars because at least it is rayon as stated. Many dresses are not rayon but poly and that makes me frustrated.  This one is actually rayon so I wanted to give a star for that.  Other than that, the dress is not a winner for me."
2.0,"I really liked the weight and feel of these socks, BUT the toes are weirdly bunchy!  Too much fabric in the toes made them very uncomfortable, so i returned them."
2.0,I am hippy and this was too tight there and too long for my liking.  Loved the tie dye
2.0,Broke after 7 month and mesh broke down after 5 months so used pliers to mash wire down that stuck out from mesh band. Durability 0 stars.
2.0,"First attempt to wear it the chain broke, was not even able to wear it. The elephant itself is kinda cute, but cheap material for a cheap price ;)"
2.0,"These earrings are definitely beautiful but they are not in for more than a few minutes and instead of staying as they should, they are hanging down like a dangle earring, not as they should be. I order everything I need to shop for from Amazon and never once returned an item. I may try to slightly bend the back to fit more secure on my ear as they should because I really love them and would like to keep them, we will see."
2.0,"I do not recommend you use this as a real hammer, nor do I recommend you use the hammer to make a point.  For example, Do Not point in at your girlfriend and say ""I will get a job when I'm good and ready!""  If you do I suspect, like me, you will no longer have a girlfriend."
2.0,Run really small.  I’m 5’9” and ordered an XL and they are really short waisted and too short legged.
2.0,soso Poor quality don't like
2.0,This is pretty but runs way too small in the groin area.  If you have a torso do not get this.
2.0,"Had to cut a little on the sides to fit the pins to my watch.Not an issue.Also, nothing to secure the excess after putting watch on. The picture shows the band having this feature. Would be happy if it had come as pictured. As is, into the trash."
2.0,"These pans are excellent, if you're a woman looking for shiny, satiny hip hugger pants for working the streets. However, for men's yoga pants, they missed the mark in a few areas.<br />1. THE SIZE IS WRONG --- These are NOT American large. Since there's so much stretch to the fabric, I can fit into them. However, my crotch and thighs are encased in skin tight satin. They ride very low on the hips.  The area from the crotch to the waist is very short, so they press up against my crotch. My package looks like it's going to burst out of the pants. Great for porn videos, not so great for around the house. They fit my legs, so the inseam is 28 inches. (I have REALLY short legs.) These are probably American men's size medium. (Or they're women's pants, which is what I think they are.)<br /><br />2. THE STYLE IS ALL WRONG -- How are these yoga pants? Yoga pants have a way to tie them around the ankles, so you can perform the inverted asanas. Since these are so lose, they're going to fall to the knees.  Because of the poor fit around the waist and crotch, any asana where you pull your legs apart, is going to further pull these down from your waist. The drawl string closure on the waist, is the only closure. But since the drawl string is really the same stretchy material as the pants, it doesn't really hold them on. The material is all wrong for yoga class obviously. (Or maybe all right, if you're a very good looking guy who wants to show off in a class of all super hot looking young women. But ONLY in that situation.) Real yoga pants are made from cotton canvas with 7% spandex, at least for men. Even if these did fit me, I wouldn't wear sheer satin pants in public. Really, they look like pajama bottoms.<br /><br />CONCLUSSION --- The only conceivable way a guy is going to wear these, is as pajama bottoms. Plus, he better be no taller than 5' 6&#34;, and wear a size 32-34 waist. And, he better have no parents, children, siblings, buddies, or basically anyone he doesn't want to look lascivious around, when he does wear them.  I would gladly have given these pants a five star review, however the product description just doesn't describe what these are.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional item for testing, examination and review purposes."
2.0,I am sorry to say it was soooo much smaller  than I expected.  Especially the diamond.  I could hardly see it.
2.0,I was too difficult to get my head through the top.The neck of the Hoodie was too small.
2.0,Loves the dress but I put it in the wash because it comes with blue stains on the cream material and not only it comes out all blue but everything in the comes out blue so disappointed
2.0,"The black coating on the frames is peeling off within one week of use.  Good price, but dont expect them to last."
2.0,"For other buyers (like myself) who are reluctant to buy clothing on-line... this product is why.  It's okay looking - the fit a tad small and material wrinkly - but would have no problem buying this t-shirt for $2.99 on a big box clearance table... it's not worth $14.99. The material is quite flimsy - and while that can make for a nice light, soft & comfortable summer garment... combined with poor quality workmanship it's a garment that can look sloppy / tacky, especially once washed.  Almost all the thread ends were left long and untrimmed and need to be snipped off - and as my pictures show, the hems and seams are poorly made, unfinished and flimsy and you end up having to iron after washing to keep the unfinished hems and neckline seams from showing and hold the garments shape.  The sleeves are cuffed but only tacked in place on top and bottom of the sleeve so the rest of the sleeves cuff flops and the unfinished seam shows.  Anyway - I thought I would spare anyone else who doesn't want to pay this price for a $2.99 t-shirt.<br />Oh, and the Made in China tag says it's 35% Cotton & 65% Polyester and to WASH BY HAND & DRIP DRY ...hmmm, maybe the workmanship can't hold up to a washer and dryer???"
2.0,"Ordered a large, definitely fit like a small. See pic used my hand for reference."
2.0,I have purchased many of the Smart Knit socks and have Loved the fit of them all including the 10 that I ordered this last time.  I order all the same color so that I know where they are in the rotation.  I ordered the grey this time which looks really pretty on the screen however when we received them and opened the package they look dirty not grey.  I don't know if the batch didn't get enough dye; but these are no where near what I expected.  All other colors have been what is expected - just not the grey :(
2.0,I was excited to put these earrings in our Advent calendar for my 10 year old but one pair was missing and I had two pairs of the same earrings as well.
2.0,I returned this item as it was too small and I didn't care for the material.
2.0,The chain was kinked and bent when opened. 😞
2.0,really hard to put on also kind of painful to put on all day i don’t know why i thought these are perfect to wear
2.0,if you do contracting work or outside work I would not use this band.
2.0,Impossible to pass the strings through holes. Only sent me one size and therefore had to return all the way to China. Beware before buying. Not an easy return
2.0,"The shirt is super cute, but not soft.  It was itchy and uncomfortable to wear throughout the day.  I washed before wearing and still found the item uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"i find the engraved text too small, smaller than visualized in the image shown<br />cuff is also not so good since it is not adjustable to wrist size. perhaps a bracelet type would be better..."
2.0,Useless & waste of money
2.0,"The soles of this sock are made of fabric and not a rubber based sole. There's no protection from rock, urchins, etc. when walking in the ocean or on land. I have several pair that I have purchased for the same price or less that do offer protection. I will not be buying again."
2.0,"I expected these to be made of the same quality, sporty material as my other buffs. To my disappointment, they are made of a threadbare, itchy, scratchy fabric. My brand name buff can hold my curls straight up; with these, the fabric is so thin that my hair just goes limp. I do not recommend these cheap alternatives. I am only giving 2 stars because they are technically functional."
2.0,"Very, very small. Nowhere close to the states size!"
2.0,they broke we brought them in July know what do I do?  he hardly wears them he wears Spiderman the most!
2.0,SUPPOSE TO BE LONG PANTS-------THESE ARE SHORT CAPRIS---NOT BOOT CUT AT ALL---WILL BE RETURNING
2.0,MUCH smaller than described & not worth it to return.  So now I am stuck with it.
2.0,Cute sweater. You get what you pay for- the sleeves were already coming apart. If you don't mind sewing them shut- it's not a bad sweater. Cute- but be ready to patch it up.
2.0,"I would suggest going up at least 2 sizes from whatever you normally wear. It is stretchy but I think it would lay better if it was a little loose. I normally wear an extra large T-shirt and a size 18 pants and I ordered the extra extra large, and it is really too small."
2.0,I got these slippers for my daughter and although it keeps your feet what only looks like a comfy pillow blanket is covering the feet. It has no warmth at the foot of the feet. It’s pretty much the cloth. I think there should not be a huge cushion on the bottom but something a little more comfortable on the foot of the feet 🦶.
2.0,WE WILL SEE HOW THIS GOES
2.0,Very thin. Won’t last after a few washes
2.0,i have the hardest time finding nice fitting bras.  the wire on these dug into my sides.  had to return them.
2.0,These were not true to size they fit like a 8 to small
2.0,"I’m 5’5 and ordered the dress a size BIGGER than anything else I wear just in case, as others have said the dress was small and let me tell you, they were right. The dress isn’t made for someone with a booty, and is EXTREMELY short. I wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing this without leggings or shorts underneath. Beautiful design and color, but not really anything I could wear outside of the house. Very disappointed, returned the dress."
2.0,Really cute but very disappointed. Bought these for my daughter for father/daughter ball and the strap on one shoe came off completely first time putting them on. Overall very cute but run a little big.
2.0,"Usually when you track a package there's like a million updates on where its at and what carrier facility has it. I only had three updates the entire time and thought I was getting scammed because there was no communication. The bag is cute, but not like the other reviews say its an exact replica and has the original designers name on it and it does not. Also it took forever and a day to get here."
2.0,"I had to return these shoes, The lights on one of the shoe wouldn’t come on even after I charged them. They were cute and looked comfy though."
2.0,"The paint/coloring comes off easily.  Given, your child shouldn't have them in their mouth, lol, but it was only for a second and he scraped some of the coloring off waaay too easily."
2.0,Was not true to size... I liked the look and wished it had fit
2.0,This product runs extremely small. I wear a size 14 (L) and ordered the XL and they are too tight for comfort.
2.0,"This item looks great in the pictures and is actually a very interesting piece of jewelry, but it is not practical for actual wear. The necklace is far too short to be worn in the manner suggested by the pictures. It also has a tendency to get snagged on pretty much everything. The wax twine is very strong but looks chintzy with all the knots."
2.0,"I ordered this dress for a '20s themed, work holiday party. I was a bit nervous based on some of the reviews, but decided to give it a chance, since I thought it was beautiful. Unfortunately, the reviews about it running small are true. It doesn't just run small, it's comically small. There are no measurements on the listing, so I went off the sizes listed - Medium being an 8/10. I am a solid medium top and either 8 or 10 pants. My measurements are 37 (34C), 30, 38. I'm 5'8&#34;. I ordered the medium and could not get the zipper anywhere near zippered. The gap was about 4 inches. The back of the dress just barely covered my butt. If I were to bend over, I would have mooned anyone within eyeshot. The dress is beautiful and appears to be well made, thus two stars, instead of one. Fit would be zero stars."
2.0,The top is a bit tight if you have broad shoulders I wouldn't suggest that you buy it. The quality is good the bottom is good the top isn't!!
2.0,This came looking like a curtain!! I would order two sizes smaller.
2.0,"I loved it until I got in the shower and it barely got wet. The ink from the black hearts smeared everywhere and stained my forehead. Other than that, I have no complaints"
2.0,"This top is really cute in the photos and it looks good on some of the people that have posted photos, but I think it is geared toward a certain figure.  I am on the curvy side and this was far too big!  I ordered a medium, but this top is not fitted remotely around the midsection, not even slightly.  It added about 30 pounds to me from appearance.  The top itself is a lightweight material and is overall comfortable, but not even that level of comfort is worth keep this top.<br /><br />Yes, I paid full price for this."
2.0,"If i buy the size in a local store then it fits my son, this online size is too bad"
2.0,Brown trout patter is not even remotely close to the picture. It doesn't even look like the same material that the picture advertises. Not impressed.
2.0,"Not recommended for persons 5'4&#34; and under. Even with pulling it up, it was way too long. Made me look frumpy. Plus the material was too thin for a ruched style skirt. It appeared to be cheaply made. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Too small even though I ordered a size up. Too short (I'm 5'3""). Fabric is cheap nylon feel. Only plus side is that they look cute in the photo. I've returned them."
2.0,"34c, this is a bit big. I’d exchange them, but I don’t care for padded inserts which tend to roll and crinkle in the wash. Too much of a hassle to deal with."
2.0,clasp very hard to open and close!! chain very pretty!!!
2.0,This cannot be extra large. The put so much pressure on my ears that I can’t wear them.
2.0,"This is a great classic style of dress, and the fact that it came in larger sizes but still had sleeves - a miracle!  There are so many designers who make sleeveless dresses for larger women, which is not a very good look.  Anyway, I ordered the grey in both M2 and M3 just to check fit, and put all the other colors in my cart in both sizes so that after I knew the fit, I could come back and buy them.  Unfortunately other than the design, this dress did not work for me at all.  The M2 fit in the bust but was too tight in the rear; the M3 was large all over, hanging like a sack with no shaping.  The fabric is good, the length is good, the color is good...the pockets were useless.  I generally don't like hand-pockets in dresses, and I think it looks dumb when women stand around stuffing their hands into side pockets.  Makes their hips look bigger.  But, in the interest of ease of travel, I thought I'd give this one a whirl.  First of all there is a horizontal-zip pocket at center lower back.  Impossible to reach.  I can just imagine the frustration of my family if I had to ask them to unzip this every time I needed the item in it!  Then there are two standard hand pockets, one at each hip, and inside each of these is a very small Velcro-shut pocket, maybe big enough for a pack of mints?  I wouldn't want to put anything too irregularly-shaped in there, because it would bulge.  And then on the left thigh there is a zip pocket which, unfortunately, extends around to the back.  This means anything you put in that pocket is going to get sat on.  So, it'd only be good for something flexible, passport maybe.  Definitely not a phone.  Sadly, I am sending these both back to Amazon, and will continue my hunt for flattering short-sleeve dresses in larger sizes."
2.0,I'm not thrilled about this umbrella.  It faded and now looks baby blue instead of navy.
2.0,"I bought it based on the image, and the earrings are not polished silver. It’s like a dark painted ones.  I’ve been using it alone because it doesn’t match with my pendant."
2.0,"Overall, it looked like the photo.  The fabric wasn’t itchy and it seemed pretty well made.  The issue is with the fit.  It was made for someone who is petite and has a very short torso.  I am 5’3” and 125lbs and wear a 32C bra but have a longer torso for my height.  The size small was a little loose around the waist and the breast area fell at my rib cage.  It looked really awkward as a result.  Had to return."
2.0,"It was cute, but it stopped working."
2.0,The top is quite long and slits are so high on the sides that it looks strange. I don’t like the look at all. I may just cut the hem a little so it’s isn’t as long and maybe the slit style will look better.
2.0,Super ill-fitting I immediately gave it away
2.0,Run small need send back
2.0,For $80 wallet its not worth it. There are better inexpensive alternatives with more ergonomic design
2.0,"Size was way off, not even close.  Also, the dots were orange, not white as shown.  I returned the suit with no difficulty."
2.0,"Not a bad lense, install was a piece of cake, however, after 2 weeks of wear, the lense coating started flaking off. To say I’m dissatisfied is an understatement, but I guess that’s what you get when you buy a cheap replacement."
2.0,"The spacing of the pearls was not as shown in the picture.  Also, it arrived in a tangled mess."
2.0,Second one that I bought and neither has fit.
2.0,"Fit is good, cut is fine. But the material is very see through, which wouldn't be a deal breaker except it looks like it's going to fall apart after a couple of washes. Sending it back."
2.0,"Order a size larger, runs small"
2.0,"These shorts are way too small! I’m typically a size 8 across brands and these shorts were 1-2 sizes smaller than a typical size 8.<br />The fabric is nice and the length is nice (not too short, not too long). I also like the color of the shorts. So disappointing that they are too small."
2.0,It's ok for a small kids gift or stocking stuffer. It is cheaply made. But fun for the cause
2.0,I ordered a size bigger that what I normally wear and it still did not fit. Runs extremely small.
2.0,"I ordered an xl in this dress,  as this is my normal size.  It is easy to small,  I would say about 2 sizes too small.  It is a cute dress, but I obviously won't be able to wear it."
2.0,"At first I loved these. They are very comfortable, they are oversized and very shady. I had no problems at all until I went to clean the lens one day & one of them popped out. Ever since then, that same one kept popping out every time i tried to clean them. I ended up throwing them away :/ not a satisfied customer. Was ok while they lasted tho."
2.0,better suited to home lounge wear than something to wear in public.
2.0,"Unfortunately, the tie or elastic for the waist was missing.  The waist was huge making the dress unwearable....I will have to return.  I am 5'3"", 146lbs I ordered sz M.  The length was perfect with bare feet, minimal support, maybe I will try a size S.  The print/dress is so cute!"
2.0,The material is thin as paper. I bought a size larger and the dress is too tight and see through. Great colors just poor quality.
2.0,"Most sunglasses are tight on my head.  These are for people with really big heads as they are hugely wide.  I also got a lot of glare from them when playing golf.  They may be great for some people, but not for me."
2.0,One of the laces looks dirty straight out of the packaging.
2.0,Very wide & tent like
2.0,Runs really smalls
2.0,"I ordered a band size up like other reviewers mentioned, and I was using the tightest hook.  For me, if I ordered this again I would order my normal size.  The bra itself is cute.  The straps are too short.  The bra was digging into my underarms, even after I lengthened it all the way.<br /><br />To me, this is more of a crop top than a bra I would wear under clothes.  The straps themselves are too wide, taking away from the cuteness of the bra.  I have smaller boobs, I don't need wide straps for support.<br /><br />My boobs did look like the model's in the picture though, when I had the bra on.  I'm a 32B."
2.0,The plastic broke after 1 week
2.0,The small was way too big!
2.0,"The shoe fit true to size; however, the straps were too short to close tight."
2.0,Pretty fits small
2.0,"Ordered gauge 6 plugs, but sizing is inconsistent and inaccurate (see photos). The ones I got are between an 8 and 6. I also didn’t realize the plugs were rounded at the end, so when they’re in they look like ball earrings more than plugs. (I was going for a more “punk rock” look."
2.0,crap...
2.0,Shirt fits as expected everywhere except for the mid section. You figure you'd have a little more gut space for a 3XL.
2.0,"Skirt is lovely but way too small, I'll be returning. I did go with the size chart and my measurements but it is way too small. I would order a size up for sure."
2.0,I just got this orange jelly fish Nixon watch in the mail today… It is a Christmas present for my son. I am returning it because what was called orange is more like pink coral. It just looks too feminiI just got this orange jellyfish Nixon watch in the mail today… It is a Christmas present for my son. I am returning it because what was called orange is more like pink coral.
2.0,"I bought this for a girl's trip to Vegas in November.  I received a discount code and was super excited as it was exactly what I was looking for.  I am a size 8 with thick thighs and curves.  I bought the M which showed as being able to fit a size 10, but was highly disappointed when I tried to put it on.  Unfortunately I was unable to get it over my bum.  Definitely would suggest going up 2 sizes before buying this romper.  The fabric is very durable and has just enough embroidery that it isn't tacky or overbearing.  Super upset this didn't fit."
2.0,Had huge rip in the knee was not at all what was in the pic.
2.0,"Super cute,love the cut, although in my opinion it is not true to size; fits tighter then a medium"
2.0,"They seem nice, but this is crazy small. At least 2 or 3 sizes small. And I even sized up."
2.0,I really did order the size I wanted but when i wear it was to big very disappointing.  :(
2.0,"Bought for a 3 Little Pigs birthday party.  Cheap, uncomforable, unattractive, unrealistic, unpleasant smell.  Did I say cheap>  You get what you pay for and they went into the trash!"
2.0,The RED string bracelet is not RED its like orange its nice but its not RED
2.0,Not what I expected.. Slightly disappointed...
2.0,I got these to protect my thumb while using hook grip on olympic lifts. They don't do the job.
2.0,I guess I expected a little more quality since I had better results with other cheap-priced sunglasses.
2.0,The slippers were so cute and comfy! The only issue is after a couple months of wearing them the material started to come apart around the smiley face.
2.0,The top of this dress did not fit and I am a tiny frame. Disappointed.
2.0,To small. not for plus size girls!
2.0,"Wsy to big and heavy, I returned"
2.0,Much bulkier than the picture makes them seem.
2.0,"This is supposed to be a dark green crystal. It is not, this is a lilac color. Order at your own risk."
2.0,So i had a good review at first but after using them for 2 weeks at work the cracked down the middle right at the nose probably wont last much longer. But they where cheap so it is what it is.
2.0,"The simple fact is they didn't fit. I like and have used Clic readers for years. I thought the sunglasses would be a nice option, but the temples would not extend enough for me to get the magnetic nose bridge catch to click together. Very disappointed. The glasses themselves are the usual great quality, I just wish they had enough &#34;stretch&#34; to fit an adult male's face."
2.0,"This is an extremely cute top. When I took it out it looked like it would fit... But no, way too small... Not getting this over my chest area lol. It would probably fit fine for anyone without boobs."
2.0,"The fabric imaging is adorable, but otherwise, it's a no-go for two reasons: 1. The fabric feels cheap - that cottony/polyester mix really missed the mark.  It's drapey, yes, but it feels and looks chintzy.  2. The birds are mutilated at the back seam - you've got some half-birds combined with other birds and chopped off body parts.  Very poor planning."
2.0,"Nothing like I expected, they feel solid and the clasp is actually really strong but I don't like this style at all. Also the ""jewels"" look cheap and just stuck on, one is already hanging off. Not impressed, probably won't ever wear"
2.0,"I am 5'5&#34; 140lbs and I ordered a small and the top chest part was huge! there was no way anyone under a D bra size could fit into this without wearing tape, which in 110 degree weather isn't the best idea."
2.0,Looks good. But real fragile
2.0,What I don't like is the dress is too short
2.0,Not a and the material. Will return
2.0,"These are warm and comfy but they are NOT leggings. They are absolutely boot cut and baggy in the lower leg. If you’re looking for leggings, these are not them."
2.0,It said it had a stop watch as well as a watch.  It is only a digital watch.
2.0,The shirt looked really nice online. It is very cheaply made and you can see through it. I paid way too much for this cheap made-in-China junk.
2.0,"After one wear and one wash, there is a hole in my new sock."
2.0,They are what they are. Cheap plastic vampire teeth. Fits a little kid's mouth better than an adults.
2.0,"Imagine the course ruffles on a child's toto,that rough stuff mesh material poking out of the sleeves of this shirt. It's so NOT the fabric on the picture. It would have been awesome if it were the sleeves shown on the picture. Way hard stuff ruffles"
2.0,"The size is not correct, I bought a 6 and the ring fit is as 5....."
2.0,"I liked the color and the fabric looked okay online. When I got it, the color was off and the fabric wasn't good. After I tried it on, I had to return it since it was too big for me."
2.0,"Cute no matter what, but the material is extremely thin, and it appears kind of cheap looking. The picture they show is certainly what it looks like, but the patches on the elbow look like they might come off after one wash."
2.0,"I ordered these slippers in the size 5.5-6, but the slippers were much too large.  When I looked at the size on the bottom of the sole, it showed European size 36-37, which isn't the smaller size.  Although they are too large, I didn't return them as I will wear them with socks, but will not wear them up or down stairs as they may slip off easily."
2.0,only used for holding up my pants; nothing utility or outside of normal dress wear. Was the best belt I ever owned then the pin fell out and it wont clamp any longer. Worked great until it didn't work anymore. Belt was only 3 to 4 months old when the pin fell out. Had it not mechanically failed it would have been the best belt I had ever found.
2.0,"I bought these in XL  because they claimed to go to 14.5 which would give me a little extra.  However, there socks are small and  hard to get on.  Also, because they are small, the toe seam rolls under my big toe and causes me discomfort.  I wore one pair on a 3 mile mini-hike to try them out and they failed.  If you have a 13.5 or 14 size foot than these socks are not big enough. I will be returning."
2.0,The material is not flattering and it's very thin. Cute neckline.
2.0,"I ordered the small in Cappuccino and like other reviewers I was disappointed when I received a Taupe brown color, not the pretty neutral pink that is advertised as Cappuccino. To make it worse the sticker on the bag my robe came in even said I ordered it in Taupe. I provided a photo to show they sent me a completely different robe than what I ordered. That color isn’t even an order option on here. The fit and quality is good though. I like that the tie is sewn in to the robe so there is no adjusting or losing it. I can’t speak for other colors but beware if you want the Cappuccino color like I did. Returned it."
2.0,"Way too small, its pretty, but thin fabric"
2.0,Amending my original review.  The shirt is nice but it snags easily.  I was only able to wear it a couple of times.
2.0,Material feels like plastic. From China late delivery
2.0,Ok. I didn’t think they helped much with packing and organizing. Zippers are cheap and many broke.
2.0,only because the face is small and I cant see it...
2.0,"I recently bought two packages of this headbands and the animal print ones are ok, so I kept those, but the glitter ones were horrible, look very cheap and kind of ugly,  like a kindergarten kid glued the glitter in, the fact that they are adjustable is great though because they do stay in, but i guess you have to watch which ones you get, i will buy again but definitely not the ones with glitter.."
2.0,Gave it away too small
2.0,"Beautiful dress, beautiful embroidery but runs way too small, at least 2 sizes too small. I’m returning but unfortunately not replacing with same dress. The bust runs even smaller than the rest of the dress."
2.0,"This is a great addition to my patio. I ordered this to accompany my other multi colored umbrella that I purchased from a store last year. The poles for this umbrella were white so I sprayed it bronze to match my other umbrella. The umbrellas are different colors but match well together. Also my older umbrella has solar light throughout which is why I gave 3 stars for value for the money. However, I still love the new one!<br /><br />Update  7/12- The pole is crap! One of the ribs broke making the umbrella unusable! I had to order a whole new umbrella from a different company! I threw this piece of junk in the dump! What a complete waste of my hard earned dollars 🤬"
2.0,"Product says it's for sizes 8-12. The heel doesn't come up around a size 12 foot. Even 11 might be pushing it. And the top of the sock is cut awfully short, leaving your calf too exposed when your trousers ride up. Nice fabric, but I would avoid buying this unless your shoe size is smaller than 11."
2.0,The reviews were accurate.  It was cute while wearing it.  Then it broke i haven't tried repairing it.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"If you plan on wearing this, you better size up 2 or 3 sizes. I am usually a medium or large, I ordered larges. They fit like an extra small. They were also incredibly short."
2.0,I was so excited to get this robe in the mail this weekend. I really want to love the robe but it didn’t come with a belt. It looks amazing but there was no belt!
2.0,not too happy with these bands. some of them came apart could not fix them could not get the band to work with the clasps very difficult to work with but I like the colors
2.0,Top section is to large and won’t stay closed properly
2.0,"A basic watch.  However, the backlight is very dim or I had a watch that was defective.  I couldn't see the time at night.  I purchased based on reviews, but returned for reason stated."
2.0,"The plastic feels cheap and flimsy. These sunglasses do come with a cloth bag to keep them in, as well as two small cloths to wipe them down with, so that is a plus. The sunglasses are also a bit oversized on the lenses, yet the sides press into my head. I don't have a big head necessarily, these sunglasses seem like they're sized to a child."
2.0,"The middle is to long, so it hangs over or under the cresent."
2.0,Not even a month it turned.
2.0,"bought a medium, seems like an xsmall"
2.0,"The material for this dress is a nice, medium weight; too bad that there's about half as much as the photo would lead you to believe. I am 5'9"" and about 170 lbs. The length hits at just below my unsightly knees - I was hoping it was more of a tea length style. As for the top, I'm not sure who has boobies on the same plane as the top of one's armpits, but that's who the dress was made for. I expected the black ruching to cover my breastal area and the butterfly printed fabric to ""hug"" them from below like an underbust corset would... I was wrong. Instead the underbust part of the dress falls right along the pointiest part of my bust and the ruching above which looked very odd until I altered it. (I removed the ruching and reattached it after removing about half of the material). Amazingly the dress still looks cute even though the curved underbust isn't under the bust. So if you stand at 5'0 and you have some serious curves, this dress might fit you with a few modifications, otherwise you must be handy with a sewing machine to make this dress fit properly."
2.0,"Didn't like them at all, cheap and looks cheap"
2.0,"So the length of this dress is perfect, and I like the material, but the reason why I'm giving this dress a 2/5 is because there's way too much material for the top part of the dress. Also, I thought the color would be burgundy but instead it was red."
2.0,Fabric seems nice but the sizing is so off my husband can’t even put them on to review how they fit.
2.0,They aren't good quality. My half didn't last two months.
2.0,"Comfortable, Sized right, washes well. (It's not cotton, its more rayon) However the material very thin.  I'll have to wear a tank top under it otherwise my children will be able too see through it."
2.0,"One of the small crystals fell out, a week later the large crystal came out"
2.0,"Dress color didn't match the picture, and the material was very coarse and scratchy. Sleeve size was too big and it was terribly unflattering."
2.0,"Sizing is not correct,"
2.0,"It's a nice scarf, but not gray. It's more of a blue/gray, almost a light lavender. I really needed a gray scarf,  so I was very disappointed, especially since it took almost a month to arrive."
2.0,Unfortunately I ended up not wearing this band at all because the rubber loop that holds the other side of the band down (I don't know what it's called) was so thick - that it irritated my wrist. Too bad because it was a pretty nice looking band
2.0,"Quite oversized. On the positive side, the fabric was lovely. Returned."
2.0,"Fitting is small, and fabric is like wearing a rubber band. Will not buy again."
2.0,"lovely cover,  ....But checkbook itself thin and flimsy."
2.0,"I have no quibble with the price, but I would have bought a much more expensive item to get the weight to make the piece hang correctly.  This one is too light weight and has no drape to it at all."
2.0,"I bought a 2xl but it fit like a size medium and it was also short lengthen, like a cropped shirt.  I gave it to my wife to wear because she's much smaller and she Saud she could wear it over something and it only came down to the top of her pants."
2.0,Seem to be very flimsy and not very good quality.
2.0,WAY OVERPRICED!
2.0,"I got these to use on a Pandora leather bracelet, as those don't have ridges on the length of leather for Pandora stopper clips.  I tried assembling (they come with the rubber washer not inserted in the silver ring) the stopper ring, then tried ""slipping"" it over the ridged thin end of my Pandora bracelet.  There was NO way it would go over the ridged end.  I then tried it on my silver Pandora bracelet, so see if that was different.  It would not fit on that bracelet either.  The only way I got it to work on the leather bracelet was to disassemble the stopper bead, first force the rubber ring on, then the silver ring, then took about 30 minutes to force the rubber ring into the silver ring while on the bracelet.  This pretty much guarantees that I will not be removing it--certainly not if I intend to put it back on.  It is ridiculously thin, and absolutely not meant for Pandora bracelets."
2.0,Son bonitas pero pequeñas y estrechas
2.0,I ordered a blue one and they sent a grey one other then that it fits my sister perfect
2.0,"Material is cheap and cut is unflattering.  Too expensive for low level of quality.  Unfortunately, I cut off the tags and washed it, so I decided I'm giving it to the needy, maybe it will be of use to someone."
2.0,"Love the side pockets, have other brands with side pockets however they are very thin and the fabric has no support. The navy collects lint badly."
2.0,They are super thin and aren't sanded at the ends so they hurt to wear.  Would not buy them again.
2.0,Beautiful but does not stay on wrist
2.0,"I wish I could rate this higher. The shirt looks great the frabric is very nice, but I have yet to be able to wear it... The first time I ordered an XL, they sent a size small. So, I returned it & ordered another XL, when it arrived Another size small!!!"
2.0,Tiene un desperfecto
2.0,was not at all what it looked like on the model/pic.<br />The material was much cheaper looking and not as flowing as the pic.<br />Had to return it.
2.0,Real carnelian but very cheap necklace and ridiculously small chain would likely only fit ppl with a very slim neck
2.0,Nice looking slippers. They run a lot bigger than the stated size.
2.0,it would have been ok but broke in two places as soon as opened package
2.0,"Smells, small. Returned"
2.0,"This shirt was ok but the bottom is waaay tooo short , sad I purchased this item :("
2.0,"We ordered three. Nice quality, but we had to order again from another company. The large size did not fit the three teenagers (with normal sized heads). The ties weren’t long enough to keep slightly loose. Next time—we will set aside time to make our own."
2.0,It was cute and thin but so tiny!
2.0,"Nice fabric and color, too bad they're too tight to wear. Why this is advertised as loose fitting sock is beyond me. My lady friend is trying to stretch them, but she's not having much luck."
2.0,"If you're shorter, this could work for you. As a taller person (5'9""), the slit came to my crotch. Like, it legitimately was in the center/not the side and at my crotch, eep HAHA. The fabric wasn't see through and it felt nice for summer. It was light and had a crepe texture. The pattern was super cute too."
2.0,"when you get everything in this bag you may as well carry a larger purse.  It's bulky & kind of heavy.  The handle is attached in a way that makes it cumbersome.  The flap that holds plastic cards doesn't work well.  If you put a single card in each slot the flap won't stay snapped because it's not made for the thickness of the cards and the magnetic snap is not strong enough,  so the card flap ends up flapping open.  Hard to get your hands in the deep pockets to get something out of the bottom.  Just doesn't hold nearly what it looks like it should."
2.0,The neck of the dress is designed to tight and not comfortable
2.0,Essentially the title. I have a very small face (i wear children's covid masks for reference) and this is waaaaay too large for me. It also has a very odd smell. Will be returning.
2.0,They are okay but not the greatest!  Material is very itchy!  :-(  I agree with couple peoples' reviews.  Do not waste your money!!!
2.0,"I love this dress but it is WAY too long.  It arrived wadded up in the plastic bag.  The dress is so wrinkled!!  I have had it hung up since it arrived and still looks terrible!!  But, I really like it.  Can’t decide if I’m going to keep it, have to pay to get it shortened, and pressed or send it back and not order from this company again."
2.0,"It was really pretty but the fit was too big, I ended up having to send it back"
2.0,It didn't fit right or look right & i got it in a M🤷🏿
2.0,"I bought a 36E, if that's your size, KEEP LOOKING *DO NOT BUY*<br />First of all, there is no push, not even a little, not even padding.<br />Second, this is NOT an E cup, *IN FACT* The tag even says 36 DD/E (Which we all know, DD is Not the same as an E). Extremely disappointed in this product."
2.0,This blouse fits. But the color is off. I ordered a ”DARK BROWN!” Not a tan colored sweater ...AND The arms aren’t as puffy as in the photo . So for that I gave it one thumbs down.👎🏾
2.0,"Cute, but size up. Way way too small. I ordered 3T-4T, but it would've fit a small 2 year old. Now must order 4-5 and hope it fits."
2.0,The dress was cute but not true to size. It was tight around the arms and chest area. Also I didn't realize there were two long slits up the front which is not particularly my taste.
2.0,"The ordered the red with black animal print. I'm 5'3 130lbs 34 D 27 waist 38 hips. The torso was way too short and the shoulder straps were loose and not strong quality. Even when I hiked the hips up really high, my boobs were barely covered. I like the vibrant color and soft material, but it did not feel as though it would survive several washes."
2.0,These run very small. I usually wear a small shirt but ordered a medium based on the reviews. The medium is still too small. You really need to size up two sizes for it to be accurate.
2.0,Thin and too small.
2.0,The picture is very deceiving
2.0,"Color is not close to pictured. Quality is goid, but tired of trying to return things. Just unhappy with amazon, and the whole hassle."
2.0,"Very cheap , very thin ."
2.0,My sister used it a couple of times and it broke!
2.0,"I did not like the quality of this coat and would not purchase again, I didn't even end up putting it on my child. It's like cheap tissue material, very wrinkly and the bow is supposed to be pinned on? I dont think a babies piece of clothing should ever have pins in it... so this was a fail! Took to long to return it so I'm stuck with it"
2.0,Ill fitting.  Fit is larger than other sport-tek shirts
2.0,I ordered these masks because they were advertised as having adjustable ear loops. They do not. I didn’t bother to return them.
2.0,"Was excited for my first set of under armour gloves...the interior stitching was irritating my fingers so I turned them inside out to wash them and noticed immediately padding was falling out due to the stitching coming undone. Decided to wash anyways, and they got worse and found a new hole in the wrist area. I was gonna return and packaged to do so, but I work night shift, and the post office is not convenient so I just suck it up for now until I decide to buy new gloves later."
2.0,"The belt feels very cheaply made. The leather is thin and the plates feel like sheet metal. The detail is off, also."
2.0,Feels cheap and did not match the watch it stated it was compatible with.  Ended up not even using it.  Its functional but low quality metal
2.0,"I was happy with the quality of the skirt for the money, but it did not provide much lift for the dress at all. The threee layers remained very flat, even after I hung the skirt inverted for a few days to maximize the lift. It did not create the intended effect (was for a 50’s skirt costume)."
2.0,Liked the pattern and material. Bought for 6 yr. old but it will belong to the 4 yr. old instead! Her normal size is 6 (which is what I bought) but should have gone with two sizes larger!
2.0,Usually wear a 2xl. That is what I purchased due to the ‘oversized description. Fits smaller that I would have expected
2.0,"I was excited about receiving these for my daughter. Once I took them out of the box, noticed the excessive glue and stains all over the shoes. Q/C is either over worked or not working."
2.0,Cute dress on the website: but the one I received was paper thin and not a good fit. The material wasn’t right.
2.0,This seemed more like covered cardboard. I expected it to be at least acrylic.
2.0,There is no elastic on back strip.
2.0,"I wanted to love this visor, but the size is very small for a grown man and looks disproportionate."
2.0,"I purchased this dress in two colors (red/green and black/green). I tried the red first and the bottom fit perfectly, but the top not so much. I had waay too much side boob like some people said they did.  It also had a poorly sewn plastic clasp in the front to pull the two breast pieces together for less front cleavage. I then tried on the black one with similar result of the red. The bottom was perfect but the top to this was seriously measured out so badly. I couldn't even put one boob in without the other slipping out, as if the top was actually for a smaller sized dress sewn to my size bottom. It didn't even have a clasp for the top."
2.0,"Way too big for my ten-year-old daughter. I ordered the large because I wanted them long and to fit her for more than five minutes. She would’ve needed an XS. She tried one on, and it is literally a dress on her. I can wear them. So that’s what will happen. I’ll take them because I don’t want to pay to ship them back. There’s are NOT girls. Juniors is more accurate. Take “girls” off the name."
2.0,"Good news you get them quickly,  make sure you hand wash individually,  the dye bleeds."
2.0,Nice looking chain for the great price. I hate that the clasp is sideways. It makes the chain twist when around your neck. Annoying. Have only worn it once.
2.0,I purchased the 24 inch luggage.  It is lightweight and very maneuverable.  Love the orange color as it stands out in ANY terminal.  But sadly on its first international trip it suffered serious damage in baggage handling.
2.0,"It is made out of a cheap material.  The cut is nice, but the material makes it impossible for the jacket to remain in the position pictured.  It would have been a nicer product in cotton.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
2.0,"My daughter loves these.  They fit her perfectly and were very comfortable.  However, they are NOT seamless at all!  She plays volleyball and you can clearly see her underwear line."
2.0,I liked this bag shape and size  however the color is a little &#34;off&#34; from pretty and the straps are just slightly too short to go over one's shoulder which was a nuisance. So I returned it.
2.0,"Cute reindeer - three year old liked it; however it didn’t fit well and the color was orange, not red. I really expected red since it is a Christmas themed dress."
2.0,"Was just looking for a pair of bike shorts for my Zion trip this weekend and came across these shorts. Forgot it was made in China —hence, the cheap price. I’m usually a size 6-7 and wear medium/large. Purchased the size medium and it looked it fit a 5 year old. Couldn’t even pull them up. Size up! I returned them and will be going to the nearest store."
2.0,It looks very cute but the clasp is so tiny. It's almost impossible to put on.
2.0,"Looks very cheap,  at least it doesn't cost 100$, I got damaged product, beats we're falling off and ripped at one spot, are all scratched, it just simple plastic.  although I received packed very fast."
2.0,"Too small. I read that they run small, so I ordered a half size up.  Not near enough.  I don’t know if I’ll return them because of the trouble.  They are a little bigger than the ones my son currently has, but his heel is still over the end.  We haven’t had them long enough for me to judge quality, but so far they look fine."
2.0,"While I am sure fabric softener and washing will soften these bandanas a bit, I decided not to take a chance and return them. They are very stiff and rough to the touch -- so much so that I question whether they are actually cotton."
2.0,Very disappointed in the sweatshirt. The sleeves are blue with flowers and the body of the sweatshirt is black! It also fits too small so my daughter--who it was for--wants me to return it.
2.0,This should probably be listed as a children’s shirt..
2.0,Disappointed. My granddaughter wears a large<br />Ordered extra large but was way too small
2.0,"I ordered an XL and it barely fit over my legs.  I will be returning this item,"
2.0,"Poor clasp. Stiff bracelet movement. Tiny, teeny, tiny!"
2.0,This shirt is a bright almost neon orange.  I was expecting a burnt orange color like the photo.  I will be sending this back
2.0,"Cute for around the house, but definitely not gym worthy. Material is very thin and stretchy."
2.0,"Like:  What it says.  Quote is nice.<br />Dislike:  Engraved letters to small to enjoy.<br />So:  Just remember the thought, not the words:)<br /><br />Will I buy another?  No"
2.0,The pants fit great but the shirt was way too tight in the shoulders.<br />If I could have purchased separately I would have but unfortunately I had to send back.
2.0,I didn't like the fact that these pants shrunk in length and no longer fit. They also when out of shape at the bottom.
2.0,One of the inseam is starting to fail after about a month after it arrived
2.0,"It a nice bag, but....... it is tiny, not a tote bag."
2.0,The fabric feels like it should be on a bathing suit. It’s very short and low cut. I would maybe keep it if it wasn’t so short.
2.0,I loved it when I saw it but it fell apart the second time wore it. I was so upset.
2.0,"there are smears of burgundy paint on the clear ID section and the leather smells funny, I  wont use the 25% coupon that was enclosed."
2.0,The shirt doesn't have a seem at the bottom so it likes to roll up and it is not very flattering. I also did NOT get the book mark that was supposed to come with it. I would not order again!
2.0,"Dollar tree quality, cheap plastic that looks like a child’s party favor"
2.0,"The earlier are a great idea, but runs small and works best for toddlers."
2.0,"More of a tunic, way to short for me.  Seller did give me a refund because I was not happy with my purchase.  Would probably be ok if you were leggings."
2.0,The piece that sits on your head is basically just a plastic bowl. It's cheap but not worth it.
2.0,"I bought large size,tight and flattened my chest.I wear size 38 B.should have ordered next size up."
2.0,I love the look of these socks.... But found them too too tight...😒 ankles puffed up
2.0,My kid still likes it we got an xL thinking it would be baggy but it fits like a kids size not adult at best an adult medium not XL. So watch the sizes
2.0,As titled.
2.0,Too simplistic. Too few features. Kid got board in two days with the few things this thing did.
2.0,Cute shirt. Very weird fit. No distinction from front to back.
2.0,extremely fragile lost a leg and arm already on the from and way smaller then I though it’s hard to read
2.0,Rough on the face and skin.  Would not purchase again.  Consider buying men's handkerchiefs or very high-end women's.
2.0,Very short waisted/short torso.
2.0,"Product blocks outlets for charging, etc. had to cut off part of bumper. Cute, but..."
2.0,Fits strange...as if backwards
2.0,"Not very thick, NOT Squat proof...unless you wear undies. Also size like three sizes up, I ordered a small and they were like kid sizes. Had to re order The large fit perfect!"
2.0,"The ring looks and feels great, but the “onyx” can very easily fall out of its socket."
2.0,"bought this with high hopes, but so disappointed.  while it kept me very warm, it shed everywhere.  the lint was all over my top and areas of my pants that came in contact with it.  even after the wash, the lint is still on my clothes. would definitely NOT purchase again."
2.0,"The color was as pictured and the material is good for the summer. It would make for a nice casual outfit.  Unfortunately, it was not flattering on me. It looks like high waisted lounge wear so that's what I what it for.  Anyone who has a little more something than I do, will fill out better and it will look great on them."
2.0,I was disappointed with this belt. Very cheaply made and definitely not worth the price.
2.0,"These bands are very cool and strong but,be very very careful, I have very small wrists and they are tight. Very uncomfortable!!!! If they were made in different sizes they would be absolutely perfect but unfortunately I do not recommend them. I only had it on approximately 15 minutes and the mark left around my wrist was pretty ugly."
2.0,Came broken Nd small a little glue will fix but what I will have to endure until then will be extremely painful
2.0,Wore it one time and already have a hole in it. Wouldn’t recommend this as a workout pants
2.0,"Too thin and doesn’t stay above your nose as a face cover. The edges aren’t locked and frays too easily. Haven’t tried them as anything but a face cover, as that is the reason I purchased them. Doesn’t hold its shape so won’t stay up on your face for very long."
2.0,Not high quality and considerably smaller than expected
2.0,They are ok for 7 dollars. They seem kinda cheap. Still cute. They are run big.
2.0,So when I ran across these I must say that I was really excited because I wanted them but I just didn't want to go and get my nose actually peers with this piercing. So I decided to buy these however when I receive them which was yesterday great timing I decided to put 1 on and I must say that it is very painful and it hurts. And it actually felt like that part of my nose was really pierced and I simply had to remove them because they hurt. And I was not happy about
2.0,I love these glasses but Im on my second set because  the legs on them come off easily.
2.0,Product was okay. Seemed like pretty good quality but didn't fit
2.0,Large rod
2.0,Very thin... Not what I expected..
2.0,"Looks nice, buckle feels cheap, grommets started separating from the fabric the 2nd day I wore it. I bought it for work so it doesn't dig into my hips with my tool belt on, I will wear it till it breaks."
2.0,"These were stunning and I was so excited when I put them on. However, when I went to secure the back of one of the earrings, the post broke off. Luckily I had already gotten the earring in my ear and my first time putting them on was for the event I purchased them for. I used tape to create a makeshift back and it stayed for the night. However, once I took that earring out there is no way to get it back through my ear because the post is gone. Not worth bringing them to a jeweler to be sautered back together. Very sad because I really liked these earrings."
2.0,Image of distressed material doesn’t match product
2.0,The emerald grips stick to clothes and blankets and brake. Also the silver scratches easily because i wear 2 rings on one finger. Nothing really special about the emrald
2.0,I bought this from my father because he wants to be a vegan and he had an allergic reaction to what ever this is made of.
2.0,Very poor material. Too bad it really looks pretty
2.0,"It's comfortable,  but magnet not very strong on band.  Band will loosen several times during the day."
2.0,Very disappointing. It fits perfect but the color is terrible. It looks like it’s been washed and faded colors on the sleve.
2.0,"Loved the look of it.  Used it to keep me safe on my motorcycle key, but didn't last 2 weeks.  I was going to buy another one, but it looks like another customer had a similar problem so I'm going to look elsewhere."
2.0,"I’m so bummed about this one. It reeked of windex like chemicals and was so so crunchy and see through. Super long, and just not a good time."
2.0,"I debated hard on whether to return these, but in the end they were just too unflattering for my body shape to keep. I wasn’t a fan of all the see-through parts on the back of the leggings but the color is great. I’m 5’5”, 125lbs and ordered a small."
2.0,Material is really thin.  :(
2.0,"Realized after receiving package of tank tops that even though we ordered XL, the sizes within the package itself where a combination of XL and L.  These tank tops are not generously size, so beware."
2.0,"The socks in the set were all marked the same but they are obviously at least a size difference between some of them.  I'm not sure if the smaller three pairs will even be usable, but I've already washed them.  If I buy a set of five socks I at least expect them to all be the same size.  Other than sizing issues they seam fine."
2.0,"Belt is made well & pretty, just not for me."
2.0,Material felt nice and size fit as expected.  Had to return because the color ordered was white and the shirt received was a pale pink.  The color when white is washed with something red.
2.0,"The designs are nice, but the quality of the material is sub par and began to fray after the first wear.<br /><br />More of a novelty bow tie then one you could incorporate into a daily dress routine"
2.0,The band holding the beads started snapping after only 2 weeks.
2.0,"The watch band broke after two weeks of regular wear. The band started to pinch my skin and randomly kink, I took it off and noticed that on of the pins used to adjust the length was bent inside one of the links. The watch itself was great when I was working out and at work, until the band broke."
2.0,Received them bent. Wouldn't order again.
2.0,"It's too small, but very pretty."
2.0,Low quality and simply not very pretty
2.0,The cup is wayyyy to small. I got a c and it fits like an a. Other than that it’s really cute though.
2.0,"I read and read and read the reviews.  Maybe I am not a pleather girl.  I just didn't like them, nothing about them did I like.  They stink, they make noise when you walk.  They look like you have rubber pants on.  So disappointed, I was so excited to get them.  I have returned them."
2.0,You need to size up at least twice. Nice blouse though. Size chart inaccurate. Other than that very pretty. Rated 2 stars because size is really off.
2.0,Really cute but my 6 year old wore through the rubber toe and the Velcro stopped working on 3 months.
2.0,"Ran really small, and lock wouldn’t hold the Fitbit, this got returned...."
2.0,I liked the color of this band but after wearing it for a few months one of the pins started coming out.
2.0,I didnt like the material at all.  The top was a little big also.
2.0,The inside pads move all around. Comfy for being inside the house. Not much support. But... I have “big girls”
2.0,"look ok, kept sliding off -- had to return.  it's cut too low."
2.0,This jacket is NOT waterproof. Looks nice and blocks the wind but I got soaked!
2.0,It was way to tiny. I had to return it. It's about as big as the picture.
2.0,Runs small. Causes a 'double butt'. I'm 116lbs and tall. Suit is cheaply made.
2.0,"Is ran way to small. Still in packet- I’ll figure out who to gift them to later. It gets 2 stars because as tiny as they are, they still look cute. Also, photo was black so that’s what I thought I was getting. Oh well."
2.0,"The print on these is adorable, but the quality just isn’t there compared to other mocs. I have no idea what PU leather is, but it’s not leather. These aren’t soft and moldable like I expected and have found in other brands."
2.0,"Large was too long but liner was too narrow and just bunched up at bottom of bra so it really didn't help.  Customer service was helpful, no problem returning."
2.0,It fits oddly.  Sent it back
2.0,Quality not great but the price is right!
2.0,"I did not like packaging, I lost it as soon as I got it. it was wrapped in little piece of tissue and put into a small ziplock bag.  i never got to wear it."
2.0,Sizes detailed by inches on chart are not correct. Runs small. Inferior zipper ... do not expect it to last long.
2.0,Loooks really cute in the picture but looked like a tent on me. Size extra large.
2.0,"Misleading description,"
2.0,Looks great too small. I have locs and id usaly stuff them into a wave cap but I can't because it don't stretch enough.
2.0,Not the size I asked for so I gave them to someone as a gift. It’s a hassle to return them.  Yes they were soft. Just too Big. Now I’m leery about ordering shoes from Amazon again!!
2.0,Too hard to put on<br />Maybe because I have really tiny wrists
2.0,Pretty and good material but definitely size up
2.0,I ordered a 3xl.  I was expecting them to be a little big but they fit like they were for juniors not women.
2.0,About three sizes off on the chart If you wear a twelve you are out of luck the largest size is about the equivalent of a size nine
2.0,"As other reviews have posted, there is not enough fabric at the top to cover larger breasts. Mine are 40DD and this was the right size, but poorly designed. I returned it."
2.0,Blue color much lighter than pictured.
2.0,The material is terrible. Ordered a size up and is still generally small
2.0,"they keep breaking,,,,!"
2.0,Very comfortable and super cute! Two stars because the butt is see through.
2.0,"Pretty nice looking watch, but seems really over priced. The moon phases is a cool addition but it's a lot more convenient to just look up the phase on your phone. Also a lot larger than I expected."
2.0,Would’ve loved but completely sheer. Couldn’t leave the house in it. Returned
2.0,Didnt like the way it felt on my arm
2.0,"Material description is completely inaccurate.  It states that it is 50%Polyester, 45%Rayon and 5%Spandex. When I received the item, the shirt says it is 95% Rayon and 5% Polyester.  Shirt looks ok but the material is more slinky feeling.  Wish I knew that before I purchased."
2.0,THE PLASTIC MELTED ON MY DRESS!!!!! This is what I AN TRYING TO WEAR FOR THE WEDDING!!!!!!!!!
2.0,I got a small and it’s huge. It looks more like a M/L
2.0,"Pretty, but the top was a 1/2 size too small and the bottom was 1 1/2 sizes too big.  Came in packaging marked Avidlove."
2.0,I've only had my boots since December 31st and I'm not happy with how they're holding up. I worry they're not going to last me very long.  Not the greatest quality and poorly made.
2.0,Ot wide enough for edma ankles
2.0,"Bought these in May. Loved them at first but now it's November and the lenses are starting to peel off. It's so bad that it's hard to see out of them at all. I've never had a pair of sunglasses ""go bad"" in 6 months."
2.0,I sent these back.  They don't look like the photo.... they remind me of pants I would get from Rainbow
2.0,"Its a very low quality watch. Its made out of plastic and I'm certain that if the watch comes in touch with water, it will likely break it almost instantly. I understand that the market for this watch is for the elderly, but if that is the case? They definitely did not make it easy to sync up to your phone and the settings aren't helpful. If you want to make products for the elderly? Make sure they are kept simple and that they work."
2.0,"Toddler gloves, they don't stretch to fit my 6 year old well at all. I won't buy again."
2.0,"To thin, not very attractive.  But comfortable"
2.0,Nice dress nice fabric but straps are bad and offer absolutely no support. Size is a bit off. I’m a size 13-14
2.0,Dress was poorly stitched
2.0,I am 5'3 165lbs and a size 12 pants. based on reviews i ordered a L and it was soooo big. The waist has a lot of extra material and makes me look sloppy and a lot bigger than I am. it has so much extra material it makes me look like i have a pooch.
2.0,More like a dress lengthwise.5
2.0,After a few months of using these sunglasses the hinge has work and the lenses no longer stay up.
2.0,"Poor fit, very flimsy. Does not fit as pictured. I’m an athletic build and this looks very sloppy and stretched out."
2.0,Slides off my foot.
2.0,This was much more delicate looking in the picture. It is actually quite large and cheap looking.
2.0,"I love the pattern of the dress but the material is very cheaply dyed.  If the material stretches at all,  the material gets lighter and more transparent.  I thought I could remedy this by exchanging it for the next size up.  That didn't help either.  The only difference I saw was that it was longer.  It did not provide and extra room in the bust area.  I do not even have a large bust, so I was very disappointed.  This dress is going to be returned for good.  Such a shame because I loved the vibrant pattern."
2.0,Looked nothing like the pic its more of a spandex suit
2.0,I have only had these for a couple months and already they are missing several stones.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"I haven’t even had my daughter try this on, but it was soaked it the packaging. Gross!! There were 3 separate items & the other 2 were completely dry, as was the package they were all delivered in. Then as I was reading reviews, I’m not the only one this has happened to. There isn’t a bad smell to it, but that’s just weird & yuck!"
2.0,"The top through the arms and bust were very tight, but from the bust down was fine.  It's a lovely dress."
2.0,Did not fit someone who usually wears a 3x
2.0,I was so sad.
2.0,Not nearly as many accent stones as shown in picture. The ones it does have are much more dull than pictured despite cleaning. The morganite is quite beautiful though.
2.0,"Too long, and not by an inch, I mean half a foot dragging on the ground."
2.0,soft and comfy but not &#34;small&#34;.. Gave it away to a friend.
2.0,We added these to our registry because they were listed as a must have on the lists we saw.  I never ended up using them though.  I kept her nails trimmed and so we didn't need them.
2.0,Son loved it but it broke after a few months. Great for the money though.
2.0,Misleading picture  ! ! I was thinking I was getting 3 bonnets for that price ! So I reordered with another company and I'm getting 4 for almost the same price.
2.0,"The purse itself looks really nice.  It went well with my outfit; however, it did not look brand new.  There were marks, material coming off in certain areas and the button that snaps to the circular clip, was rusted as if I had worn it for a long time.  I’m very disappointed!! Will not order from this seller again."
2.0,Poor quality. The strap broke the first day. I was looking for a hat that would cover my ears and let my big ponytail hang in the back. But this hat is too small for a person with a lot of forehead. The mask is also cumbersome to put on. Good idea. Poor execution.
2.0,"I have bought so many of these, but the rainbow pair came with a hole in it."
2.0,"It doesn't do anything, it doesn't light up or anything. This is a box with a handle on it. If you need it to show that you know what a ghostbuster trap looks like this is perfect. If you want it for a costume and you want to play with it I would go with the other one"
2.0,"The waist and leg holes are true to size, but there's hardly any room up front (as others have reported). It's downright suffocating. I couldn't wait to jump out of them. On the plus side, the briefs appear well made, especially the waistband. It's wider than most and looks like it would not be the first thing to fall apart, as is the case with most underwear I've had to retire in the past."
2.0,"I purchased this back in March to help my daughter remember to use the bathroom. The watch functions as described and has been a big help.<br /><br />While the module itself is great, it is not up to the rigors of hand washing and normal childhood activities. Recently I have noticed that it has fogged up on the inside and is no longer water resistant.<br /><br />I would like to invoke the 18 month warranty on this as it has not been abused or used in any water-based activities that should have caused the watch to fail in this fashion."
2.0,Second wear (not even full days wear) and the dog charm fell off the chain 😔
2.0,"While they do look nice, and do add a certain appeal, the quality of the build is horrendous. I had one snap off, simply after tightening my sleeve after affixing the cliff link in place. The &#34;S&#34;popped right off.<br />I understand these are not very expensive, however with metal, and technology available today, I would have thought I would receive more than simply 3 wears out if the product."
2.0,Wasn’t internally threaded like the description.
2.0,This item is way too small for a xlarge but offered half a refund which was nice
2.0,"Poor quality, very thin material. Neck was stretched out upon arrival."
2.0,"for me it is not comfortable. It hits the middle of the knee, which bother me and also they are heavy."
2.0,"PROS:  They are stylish, fit well, and are inexpensive.<br />CONS:  They break WAY too easy.  I've bought 5 or 6 pair, as they keep breaking."
2.0,skirt is too big and the top is small me i can't able to wear it
2.0,"the shoe is much bigger than it seems it would be. was going to give it to a 1st grader, but the size was awkward."
2.0,Strap doesn’t stay tight on 6 year old. So falls off and needs constant adjustments. Durability is good. Doesn’t go small enough for 3 year old.
2.0,Oh well.
2.0,"This is described as a maxi dress.IT IS NOT A MAXI DRESS. 2 reviews with the same disappointment. I am 5' 7&#34; tall; the dress is just past my knees. It is not even close to what is pictured on the model, therefore it is not as described in length. The color and fit are as described, but it doesn't make up for how short it is."
2.0,The gemstone color is nice but the metal is crap. It looks burnt. Definitely not worth the money.
2.0,Bought a large but came way too big.
2.0,Fabric is a little too thick and makes the dress a little uncomfortable
2.0,The dress was not as expected. It is really cute but the dress was slanted at the end. It did not align. I needed this for a party and I wasn't able to wear it because of the defect. I was really disappointed.
2.0,Its a very thin material... In the picture it looks like it would be thick and long but its thin and short. Not too happy with this purchase.
2.0,"I’m 5’6” but these jeans only come down right above my ankle bone, the denim tie attached to your side is loose enough that it dangles. it’s a good enough jean material, but it’s also quite stiff and bunches up near the crotch… not the worst pants ever but surely not like the photos"
2.0,Arrived tarnished
2.0,So so small. Prfff
2.0,"It's a cheap dress, the fabric is rough and stiff and the stitching isn't great. Lots of frayed threads out of the box. The shoulder straps are barely sewed on, with a few wears I have no doubt one would break. I have bought much better quality dresses on Amazon for similar price. Definitely will no order again."
2.0,Disappointing fit
2.0,"It’s ok I guess, but it just looks very cheap. But the worst part is the sleeves… they are a weird length and the tight elastic around the cuffs of the sleeve are ugly and uncomfortable. Maybe I’ll wear it around the house when I’m cleaning or something but other than that, I’m not impressed."
2.0,I purchased a 3x because I wanted it to be big on me. It's easily a woman's large - maybe.
2.0,"I thought this was going to be a dress I would wear out, but the material is very thin."
2.0,don't like the size and will be returning.
2.0,Did it make my butt look bigger? Yes. However there was so tummy control with these like i get in my other leggings.
2.0,I love the style . It was too close around my stomach and the crutch of it was too long . I quest this was made for a taller person
2.0,"This dress was made weirdly. I ordered the gray pattern but it’s actually a navy blue pattern, which was still pretty. I’m 5’7 and the dress only hit my ankles. The top is a drawstring that you can tie in the back, but when you tie it, it tightens the armpit area which makes it uncomfortable and it never looks even in the back. If I had someone else tie it for me, I would’ve been able to make it look even but the overall look of the dress was just cheap. I’ve returned it."
2.0,The material felt cheap and not like real leather. Ended up returning it because I wasn't happy with the look or feel of them.
2.0,"Logo had a black mark on it in front and the mesh was loose, quality was lacking but awesome design."
2.0,"It was ok, It came with a hole in it, I had to stitch it up.... that was disappointing. The small was a bit big for me"
2.0,The band is beautiful but weak. I had my band for a week and the band broke in half.
2.0,"Two weeks after my girlfriend started using it, the inside lining fell out. Since it was not worth returning, we just glued the lining back and kept on using it. Other than the lining, my girlfriend loves it."
2.0,The chains are poorly made. But it's what I expected for the price. They look much better in the pictures.
2.0,"Is this really made of mulberry silk and cashmere? Who knows! I am very suspicious of clothing made in China and sold directly through Amazon. A lot of scarves sold on Amazon and advertised as ""silk"" turn out to be ""silk like"" polyester. I purchased this item and there is no fiber content tag and no care tag on it. I thought that by US law clothing items needed to have a tag on them. This scarf works OK for me but it could be made of almost anything."
2.0,They are too big for my face so I can't see out of the bifocal unless I lift the glasses up. I liked the price and they were lightweight just too big.<br />How do I return them?
2.0,They came a bit bent unfortunately
2.0,"The fabric of these pants is lightweight 100% polyester with little ridges, kinda shiny on the inside, could be see-thru if the color was light.  Could pass for corduroy only if someone with bad eyesight was looking at them from a distance."
2.0,It tarnished after the 2nd time I wore it.
2.0,It stretched out after only a few washes.  It doesn't fit my frame and i am pretty disappointed.
2.0,Fits to big and difficult for kids to walk on do to the material
2.0,"Ordered this as a gift. The recipient put it on and one of the pins holding the bottom piece on instantly fell out and disappeared into the carpet. Had to fix it with some glue. Aesthetically this necklace looks great, but I am disappointed with the quality."
2.0,"I normally wear size S or XS even. I knew this jacket runs small and had ordered size L. Well... should have ordered XL instead. The material is cheap, It does not look like in the pictures at all. Do not expect it to be the same quality like those that you buy from stores in North America."
2.0,"Skimpy fabric, poor tailoring."
2.0,The shorts are a completely different color than shown!!!!!!
2.0,Was tight for a size large
2.0,"I was expecting a little more than a crumpled up, transparent mess. It could have come out worse, and I'm not TO mad at it. I will still wear it knowing I got a Ghost face maks, but you lose points because it looks bad. The back cowl is nearly translucent and, again, it came all crumpled. Not the worst I have ever seen, but room for improvement. :/"
2.0,"Product equal to the picture, but poor quality. I dont like so much."
2.0,"Material used side pockets is of poor quality for this use and will ""hole"" quickly. Also zipper should be beefier instead of thin design. These NOT DESIGNED FOR HEAVY USE!"
2.0,Quality was very poor for a pajama gram product
2.0,Too small and kept sliding down
2.0,Cute style / fabric...not a great fit...too long....too..ugh. Sent it back
2.0,The threading is not the greatest idea for this product as it worn out very quickly 😐
2.0,"I've worn and washed these maybe half a dozen times. Not the best quality. There's already a hole in the crotch area, so I basically just wear them around the house when I'm cleaning."
2.0,Had to return because they fit small plus not 100% polyester its a 80% polyester and 20% spandex.
2.0,"My son loved it but after a month or so, a hole formed and the stitching came out. Won’t be purchasing again."
2.0,Was a tad small in the chest and didn't fit me right. Decided to return.
2.0,"I absolutely loved this when I bought it about a month ago. It looks exactly like pictured and the leather/gold combo was really pretty. I wore this a few times a week and already the backing has become so loose that it doesn't stay shut anymore. 5 stars for how it looks, 2 stars for being cheaply made. :("
2.0,These were really cheaply made shoes considering what I paid for them.
2.0,"I liked this dress a lot. Light, casual, comfortable. I only wore it twice and the strap broke right off during the second wear and it’s not like it was tight on me to begin with. Very cheaply made and not worth it if you’re going to wear it more than once. Such a bummer because it’s adorable!"
2.0,"Hardly anything like the description. This is a simple unlined jersey sweater jacket with no shaping, backing or lining of any kind. The fabric is mostly shirt jersey and has no real body.  It is clearly not a blazer, not enough body to be a sweater and made like a wrap tunic. It is also not a slim fit.  I am disappointed that this is described as a blazer jacket.  It is actually a shirt jacket and way overpriced as such."
2.0,"I bought this mainly for the magnetic ones since I missed having a septum but with covid I wanted to a better option. Its ridiculous to put on, I have struggled with aligning the two parts for like 30 minutes TWICE and one would just fall out like 2 minutes later. The others work fine but not worth the money"
2.0,Not as described!
2.0,These are cheap and thin. They also snag. If someone wants to wear them every day they would have to get a new pair for every day.<br />I’m dissatisfied with this purchase but will continue to be an Amazon customer.
2.0,"What i though i order was going to be a ACTUAL small but that could've fit my mom 5'7"" figure (im 5'3"") how I wanted to fit me slightly loose but manageable, the black harness thing was way to big and I couldn't even adjust it at all, I was a little pissed cause I wait twice for this thing to come in stock and ended up returning it in disappointment"
2.0,Wish I read the reviews 1st!!! If you like putting things  together this is for you. It’s literally in pieces and not good pieces lots of damage to it very disappointing. I got pics but hard to see and the pink basket I had to glue back together. but this is what my daughters top Christmas wish was for and didn’t take it out of the box to put together till Christmas Eve
2.0,Too chunky and not flattering. Returned.
2.0,I kind of expected them not to as I can only wear real Oakley lenses. They seemed to have been made of high grade material but as other &#34;unauthentic&#34; sunglasses these gave me headaches in bright sunlight. I called customer service and was told that it may be a defect and to try another pair. I paid to send it back and heard nothing back. I started a requisition with Amazon in March I bought them in December and received my money back from them.
2.0,"I also own a set of solid colored tubes from the same seller.  In comparison, this &#34;Floral Print&#34; set is severely lacking.<br />- the solid colors are reversible, but the patterned ones are not - they are white on the other side.<br />- the solid colors are a tube with no visible seam, the patterned ones have two visible seams each.  (they are listed as &#34;seamless&#34;)<br />- some of the tubes have logos on them - I got one in my floral set.  I imagine that it's poor quality control when cutting fabric as it's only on one.<br />- the fabric is texturally different from the solid colors, and they are more slippery<br /><br />In general, to answer questions I've seen.<br />These are tubes, so they are not the same as a bandana, but they can be used hold hair back while working out, and they can also be pulled over the face.<br /><br />These are not meant to keep you warm.  They are thin.  If you're buying something to use as a cowl for warmth and not for modesty or sun protection, please consider a different product entirely."
2.0,Sizing is very wrong.
2.0,Nice material but too big for me.
2.0,"It’s cheaply made. You can tell just by the feel of the fabric. I knew before she had it on that it would be slightly see through. And I was right.<br />It’s cute and fits well, but it’s not going to last very long. It should be a cheaper by price for what you get."
2.0,These “pajamas” are about 2 sizes too small.  I ordered a large and they are at best a medium but I’m thinking a small.  Unless you are a really tiny person I wouldn’t buy them.  I gave it a 2 for fluffiness.
2.0,"Way too short, it's so cute but didn't even reach my chest. Size large. Fit everywhere else. But the cups were at my upper abdomen. I don't know how they got it on this model in the picture."
2.0,Cute but the hearts started falling off after a week or two.
2.0,"It was cheap and worked for a Halloween costume.  But some of the necklaces arrived with creases on them, thankfully not the color I had needed."
2.0,"the xl was a flowy, thin polyster and when i ordered the 2xl, it came as a heavy, very thick polyester knit and very tight with no give."
2.0,"The only reason I gave this luggage 2 stars is because it 'might' survive it's first journey.  Minimal aluminum, maximum cheap plastic.  The locking devices will almost certainly break off the first time they receive any kind of hit during handling.  You better buy a good set of luggage straps if you decide on this model.  Also, after you receive this inferior product and realize it is basically a piece of plastic garbage, you will find the return policy likely includes a 15% restocking fee, warnings that the return will be rejected should the product not be immediately resellable, and YOU pay the shipping fees.  This is likely the worst online purchase I have made in years.  I will give an update after my first flight."
2.0,It's cute but it's more of a crop top kind of shirt. I didn't expect it to be that way. I bought 2 sizes up so it could look oversized like the description says but when I put it on it went to my belly button. The top was a bit wide too.
2.0,Not the color in the picture
2.0,Kinda cute but very cheap.. Already has a hole in it
2.0,not good for money !
2.0,"These fit okay, in an exaggerated waist and hips sort of way.  The fabric does not have the substance you would expect in denim, it's very light weight.  I have not found myself wanting to wear them very often.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.  I hope you found it helpful."
2.0,"I guess it covers my noggin like it's supposed to, but it is by no means &#34;slouchy&#34;. I was very disappointed since that was my reason for purchasing it."
2.0,"The Jean's are definitely not for a curvy figure. The inseam was way to long, and I'm 5'5 and the legs were shorter than I wanted."
2.0,Had to use a ring opener pliers and a set of vice grips to even get the ball out. There is no way to get it back in.they are ok with the rubberbands.
2.0,I thought this would be silver but it was gold. You get what you pay for
2.0,Disappointed. Ordered these to add to my other 6 pair of Equipo boxer briefs: sized large also. Why do these have large circumference leg openings? Unable to find the exact same style number I like after searching multiple retailers. Wish me luck returning these.
2.0,"Buk's face is too big,and text is too small. I found another one I liked better, but this shirt lead me there.Thanks!"
2.0,"It looks  pretty, it seemed sturdy but the part that goes into your ear broke off. The actual cuff is very small and does not fit comfortably."
2.0,"Like the design and the fabric, the way it feels, but its simply too long. it feels well around the chest and shoulders but the length prevents it from liking how it looks. I'm 5'8&#34;  at about 175-180 lbs."
2.0,UPDATE: 29 Sep 16<br />First it was one snap and now it is both.  It is really annoying when the shelf falls for no apparent reason.  I'm not a giant guy so I'm not trying to fit &#34;XXL&#34; clothing and shoes in it...I'm 5'4&#34; and 170lbs carried well. I put my work slacks and button up shirt on the shelf andthrsnaps come undone.  Very frustrating.  The zippers are starting to hang up when using them...not sure why.  I'll investigate further when I have time. I really had high hopes for this because it looked like it would do what I was looking for.  The search continues.<br /><br />Works good.  Designed for a little larger lockers than the ones at my facility.  I really like the different compartments; however the snaps for the bottom shelf on mine don't stay snapped.  It is a bit annoying and is the only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating.
2.0,The pictures show what happened to the shoes after 2 weeks of wear. That is considering that during quarantine my child walks inside less than typically. Very disappointed.
2.0,"The color is dull with a &#34;washed out&#34; look... not a good fit, wide at the wrist and does not provide warmth.  Fabric was rough and quite unappealing against skin.  Runs small with short fingers.<br />I bought these for a gift but was too disappointed to actually give them."
2.0,"Well, just let me say, I love the color. But I am absolutely disgusted that these boots were made in china. I researched USA boot companies and chose Dingo because they claim their boots are made in the USA. Sure, some of the hardware may be imported, But not the entire F***ing boot! What a disgustingly dishonorable company. I will never buy from them and absolutely can not recommend them!"
2.0,If you’re bustier it looks weird. The sleeves are supposed to be a little longer but the fit is odd and not flattering especially in the shoulders and arms. The fabric is well made but expect to tailor this dress.
2.0,"I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 100lb. The first time I wore a pair for a few hours, I got 2 holes below the ankle area. Not sturdy enough."
2.0,"This hat is very comfortable and warm.  But that is the end of the positives for me.  Cheap quality.  It started to come off the seams after 2 uses and has getting been worse and worse as time has gone on.  This brutal northeast weather is the only reason I am still using it.  Plus is it worth returning?  Paid $10 for something that will not last beyond the season.  Like the warmth, would not buy again."
2.0,"These shoes are sooo pretty and have so much potential, however, 5 steps in and those cute straps will keep moving to either side.  It’s such an inconvenience to keep having to adjust them.  I’ll be trying to glue them in place, see if that helps."
2.0,would have been better if I had larger size
2.0,No me agrado se siente pesado
2.0,Great for women over 5'7 feet tall.
2.0,"The glue came apart from the soul to the boot after 3 weeks , just from walking around ,"
2.0,Material is too thin. Nothing like the other shorts from the same brand. I thought I was getting a good deal but I didn’t.
2.0,Strap not that sturdy after a few uses it broke
2.0,I wanted to like this watch band but it ruined every shirt I ever wore with it because the band was constantly snagging. It looks exactly as pictured and is good quality but I won’t be wearing it ever again.
2.0,The material was made almost from burlap sack material and was really course to the touch. It was a little difficult to tie because of this and I didn't particularly like that. I liked how narrow the tie was though.
2.0,"This dress is pretty but was too tight on me. The slip underneath was way too short and kept ridding up. There were some loose strings and this looked & felt a little cheap. Also it’s completely see-through, you will need a slip. I wanted to love this dress but sadly it didn’t work for me. For reference, I typically wear x-small-small in Express dresses and the small in this dress was too tight."
2.0,Not good for kids with wide foot or big big-toe
2.0,"Sizing is waaaaaay off.  Nice material and seems well made,  Should have noticed many of the positive comments were due to getting a 'discount'.  Returning it."
2.0,"It was too big for me. It had potential to be cute though. The back was longer than the front, just looked odd to me. If it was the same length at back as in front I would’ve kept it."
2.0,Loved the look but they were way too heavy
2.0,This piece of jewelry was missing three inlays.
2.0,"I got these in size 34. I think they're designed for someone with a 34"" waist and bird legs or something. When standing, they are a little tight on the front of the leg - mostly upper leg. They absolutely fight back when bending a leg at the hip - like when sitting down. Maybe the other sizes are better, but US size 34 is no bueno.<br /><br />This bad fit is saddening because otherwise these would be really shorts. The material is great, the build quality is good, the arrangement and selection of pockets is fantastic. They held their shape after a trip through the washing machine and dryer (low heat).<br /><br />The clothing tag is bad - it's made of that cheap material that can be itchy and scratchy. It must be cut off and good luck not damaging a seam when you do it. I always deduct a star for using a cheap tag."
2.0,"These earrings are heavy for a 7 year old.  Also, two pairs came damaged :("
2.0,"Cute socks but not worth it, the white ones turned brown on the bottom after one use that didn’t go away after multiple washes. Also the ankle bands are tight so slightly uncomfortable."
2.0,Super cheap looking. Terrible purchase. Wish I would have listened to the bad reviews
2.0,This dress is short on me and I’m only 5’5”. I ordered the wine colored one and it is bright red. The material is nice and it does have pockets though.
2.0,the dye is wearing off quickly on the canvas and the inside structure isn't user friendly....inside pockets collapse into bag when you put items in it☹️<br />but as a backpack style it is fine
2.0,"Although the design and the earring are nice, the post is flimsy and breaks off very very easily.  For the price, I should have thought so, but I wanted to try.  I was going to send back for refund but haven't been able to locate to resend and would have to take time to send.  So I lost  $10.00. I again liked the design but cheaply made as to the post.  Very thin post that is not adhered well to earring."
2.0,Tow times I have ordered this shirt and they are oversized quite a bit> Normally I would take an XL but even a medium was too big. I do understand they are a relaxed fit but when the seam is two inches off the shoulder it is too much for my liking.
2.0,"this necklace looks great but the quality suuucks. I returned it because the second I took it out of the box and tried to put it around my neck, THE CLASP BROKE. I'm not even exaggerating. I legit JUST TOUCHED IT, and it broke off into my hand. really really really BAD quality. I bought another similar necklace from amazon itself after returning this one and it's even better looking and the quality is a lot better too. so yeah, do not buy this. buy literally anything else, but not this."
2.0,Runs VERY small! A size 3x is more like a US size 6
2.0,"I didn't think this type of material could pill, but it did, and after only 1 wear/wash. I have a sweater shaver that I use on it after I wear it and it keeps it in check, but I wouldn't recommend this tank."
2.0,I ordered a size small in this dress and was sent a 2XL....ended up returning it because I didn’t love the fabric either. Pretty disappointing!
2.0,I've try to tie my hair with it. It's not working. No use that I can think of. Sorry.
2.0,"Low quality tie, I never wear it."
2.0,"I purchased this musical box for my daughter for Christmas. However, when it arrived, I was shocked at how tiny it was. I was expecting something much bigger. I honestly think it’s really cute and it has great sound, but it’s overpriced for the size. I gave it to my daughter, but not for Christmas. I didn’t want her to be disappointed when she saw how small it was. Unfortunately, she was just as surprised and disappointed as I was."
2.0,The material is stiff a s rough even after washing.
2.0,Great idea but extremely difficult to put on shoes due to the thickness of the ends. Also the ends are likely to rip when installing
2.0,Terrible fabric - not soft and wrinkles horribly. Will not repeat.
2.0,Looks nice but too big for a woman’s hand
2.0,Disappointed at how then it is had got it for a winter robe but won't be warm enough. It
2.0,THIS IS A COPY OF A REAL ON... ITS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE & ITS CHEEPLY MADE
2.0,"ordered in a small. bra size 34D. bust area was very large. straps continually fall down. no bust support. side boob shows for sure, a little too much though. very difficult to keep straps up in a comfortable/desired place."
2.0,didn't like for my size 14 body
2.0,Does not fit very well on the wrist. I got is as a gift and did not end up giving them . If you have thin wrist. This doesn’t look flattery at all !
2.0,Paper thin! Don’t waste your money
2.0,"Great dress for a summer event, very lite weight, but a little see through. Not good quality material, ripped the very first time I wore it. Very disappointed that I had to throw it away because there was no way to fix the 8inch rip down the back of my thigh!!!!"
2.0,It came early but it look old
2.0,"They do not have the ""presence"" or ""consistency"" that is sold in the photo."
2.0,Way smaller then I wanted and the zippers were broke.
2.0,Weird material. I didn’t read what type of material as I fell in love with the color pattern. Definitely not what I was expecting. I thought it was cotton ( T shirt type material )<br />At wasn’t. Also runs small.
2.0,"Nice tights, but they were too small that I had to return them. I would recommend ordering up 1 or 2 sizes."
2.0,The beads are nice and the bracelet was comfortable but broke into pieces. The elastic band inside is not good quality and broke after only a few wears.
2.0,"I put the brown belt next to black shoes and brown shoes, and it matches the black ones. Way too dark; the picture does not represent what they actually send"
2.0,"Shoe got full marks for looks and quality materials; however I purchase this brand for the arch support and any and all arch support was lost with the addition of the heel :(  Vionic is also inconsistent with shoe width; these are on the narrower side, though not the narrowest I have tried of theirs.  Wish it had the arch support; adding arch support to a heeled shoe just does not work."
2.0,"I got a run in a seam on a sock the first time I wore it. Other than that, the have been good. Just nervous they won't last long. Might be worth it to invest in more expensive socks if yiu plan on wearing them often."
2.0,"Sturdy product, however the visor become difficult to see through within just a few minutes. My daughter had a very difficult time breathing out of it. The material is thick and the concept is great, but she was very uncomfortable, especially with the visor."
2.0,Not what I expected nased on the advertised product.
2.0,"I started wearing this ring as soon as it came in only taking it off when showering like i do with most of my jewelry. It's beautiful, but first i thought the etching didn't get smoothed down and started getting a minor rash from it on my other fingers, but no. It appears the writing was stamped/painted on, because some of it came off today.... i'm not sure what the dealio is but i'm going to continue wearing it to see what will happen..."
2.0,Wasn't what i expected. Style is like cheeky underwear. Not boy short. Can't wear in public for myself being a mother. Maybe on vacation with the girls and single in Miami... not for me. Also had quality issue where there were two Loose threads.
2.0,"Very pretty, but the band is sized smaller than true size.  The fabric, especially the lace on the cup, is scratchy.  In what looks like an effort to insert a buffer between lace and skin, a strip of stretchy plastic fiber is zig-zagged into place, which makes me wonder why this was done, and if the stretchy plastic fiber would curl after washing."
2.0,These bags a very small if you plan to use them as candy bags which you cannot tell in the actual picture. The graphics on the bag are true as advertised.
2.0,This is not what I expected - its basically parachute material and I would not wear it except in an emergency situation - would return it except I don't want to put the  in so I will pack it in a suitcase for a travel option - it looks better in the picture than in the reality
2.0,They’re very pretty but the beads broke off / unraveled quickly.
2.0,"I washed the shirt twice. The second time I pulled it out of the wash, there was a large rip in the armpit area and on the back of the shoulder on the opposite side. Maybe I got a bad piece of material for my shirt. Either way, pretty bummed out about it. I ended up sewing it altogether and the shirt is usable, but definitely not a dress shirt anymore.<br /><br />The shirt fit as expected."
2.0,"Se ajusta bien, pero la forma en pico no es para mi."
2.0,These look nothing like the picture. Bigger than normal and they're extemely stretchy. More like a dpandex material then jean. Not a fan at all.
2.0,They are hard to use.  Very thin and they pull apart when trying to get the back off to stick them in.
2.0,"Snug fit, although I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear.  Inexpensive quality, but I only wear it at home, as a house dress."
2.0,"Such a shame that this band snags clothes because it is an otherwise functional, nice-looking band.  I have ruined many pieces of clothing because of this band."
2.0,"Thin and ugly, baggy cut."
2.0,It's made well.  Good material.  But it's awkwardly tall and it doesn't fit in my pocket so I can't use it.
2.0,They were much smaller than I expected. Really disappointed. I would send back but I hate returning stuff.  I have a wide face and they just look and feel too small.
2.0,Super disappointed. I ordered this as a gift but the lettering is peeling off and damaged. It’s lightweight and the material is soft. It seems a little big but fine for outerwear.
2.0,Cant write well on them. Tossed them out.
2.0,Black drops are smaller that they seem.
2.0,NICE BRACELET BUT ALWAYS COMING OFF WONT SECURE GOOD AND ONE OF THE CLASP CAME OFF SO CANT WEAR IT ANYMORE
2.0,"Horribly misquoted on sizes! Whichever size you would like, be sure to order a size three times larger. The only reason I gave this an extra star (to make two stars) is because the detail of the print looks amazing. I've already placed another order for size 5XL. I'll either find someone that would like this or I will be returning my first purchase."
2.0,Thin material but not breathable. Returned. Fit true to size
2.0,"Very cute and fits as expected but its so white and thin. This outfit is very see-through and I can't wear anything underneath, not even the whitest of underwear that I own, without it being seen."
2.0,"Bought it for a friend baby but the mask is too big for little 2 yr baby, it fit me okay so I’ll wear it. Just be aware not for little baby."
2.0,"North face discontinued my favorite boots so I tried these instead. I hiked in them steadily for two months and they held up very well in terms of durability, with no splitting or tearing anywhere. Unfortunately, after a mere week or so they lost whatever small waterproof ability they may have begun with. Stepping in squelchy ground or walking through wet grass, the water literally poured through the sides instantaneously; they're about as waterproof as sandals. My wife was wearing Lowa boots and in the same conditions she never wet her feet."
2.0,"I had read other reviews that stated that the color was not what was posted on the website and I have to agree.  The color looks faded.  My daughter really wanted this one, but since I bought her a second one (Neon Tie Dye) she only wears the galaxy one if her other 2 are dirty."
2.0,One of the shoes wouldn't light up. My daughter was disappointed.
2.0,It was cheap and not a sweatshirt at all. Felt like stretchy costume material.
2.0,"The finish and design are wonderful.<br /><br />Keep pretty good time...WHEN it keeps time at all!<br /><br />The second hand keeps getting stuck on the minute hand and the watch just stops! This just keeps happening randomly. Sometimes it will run for hours just fine, then just stop dead because the second hand sticks to the minute hand. since there seems to be no trigger for this happening, I cannot rely on this watch for keeping time. In a drawer it goes. Too bad, It really is a nice watch. Oh well.<br /><br />Not going to go through the hassle of contacting, shipping, insuring etc. etc. Live and learn."
2.0,Not what it appears to be!
2.0,The material that it is made off is really cheap and snags and everything sticks to it. For a $40 shirt I expected better quality material
2.0,"The shirts are nice, good quality but they run way small. I'm 6'02 245lbs so I ordered 2XL shirts. I put the shirt on out of the package and they were tight but not too bad. Once I washed them, they shrunk and now they barely cover my belly button and it's like wearing a wet suit. Unwearable for me!"
2.0,Not the quality that I expected from online description!
2.0,I didn't like the fact that the JEEP logo blends in with the color of the hat and doesn't really show.  The hat overall is much darker than it appeared.
2.0,Not even sure what type of material it is it doesn’t say but feels like printed polyester do not recommend
2.0,If you wear an xl shirt go up up in size. I like it but the arm is tight and it's just a little to small
2.0,"Absolutely loved these pants!  Had them just over a month, and was wearing them at the grocery store.  Bent over to get something off the bottom shelf, and the pants split right up the butt seam!  Completely mortified.  Thankfully, my daughter was with me so that she could push the cart and grab the items, while I held my shirt over my backside, so no one could see my undies."
2.0,The material was not flexible enough and the dress was cut without shape.
2.0,Why are these socks so tight?!
2.0,"Did not function, returned it."
2.0,Mask did not look like the one advertised
2.0,Super cute boots but the heal cap came off after just a couple weeks of wear.  Cost me $15 just to have it fixed so I am NOT happy about that!
2.0,"Runs very small. Ordered a large, would need XXL to have similar loose look as on the model. Fabric is not soft and is a bit scratchy and it is see-through. I got the white and would definitely need to wear a cami under. It’s one to be returned. Would not recommend."
2.0,The pendant was very small and chain appeared fragile.
2.0,To too big
2.0,Way too tight. And I ordered the Large. I’m 5’5 & 160 lbs.
2.0,The print shown in the picture only appears on one side of the scarf.  It cannot be worn without seeing the “blank” side.  Very strange.
2.0,"Super cute and soft but the seam came undone the very first wear-and my little one doesn't walk yet-but after 15 minutes in the walker I noticed a small hole near the toe and by the end of Christmas Eve, most of the toe was open-she was held and in her walker. The fit is perfect so I don't think she busted out of them."
2.0,"The description reads “slim fit“ but this thing is big—super long, too. It’s just an average Hanes T-shirt; it’s thick and scratchy, not soft and fitted. I’m disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Horrible. Didn’t work well and whatever adhesive they use gave me a bad rash reaction.
2.0,Bathing suit material.. not at all what I would expect for a cardigan. Thought it would be a cotton material.
2.0,"1. Light and thin. Not bad things in themselves. But if you don't like your nipples showing through, you'll probably want to wear an undershirt, which sort of defeats the purpose.<br />2. Cheaply made in China. Mine came with a few loose threads. Not worth $30.<br /><br />Would I buy it all over again? No."
2.0,"Update: So I had to cut the box open and the watch was in it, but it was covered in gravel. I felt so embarassed giving it as a gift.<br /><br />Original Review: I'm unable to even open the box... It feels sealed shut. Based on how the boxes are usually made, I should be able to easily separate the bottom section from the top. I have no idea what's in the box."
2.0,"Okay, first off I wanna say how large this item is. It’s like throwing a blanket over your shoulders, and the arms are not like the picture, at all!<br />Second, this item came vacuum sealed which is great, however, it was wet before hand it was sealed. Once I opened the bag I was hit in the face with a strong mildew smell. I have soaked this and washed it 2 times. Now, I will say it did not shrink, but the smell!!! I don’t see how I can ever wear this. If it wasn’t for that I would have given more stars."
2.0,I bought this for my husband  only had a month and the buckle broke
2.0,"So I bought this dress in green after buying in in black and LOVING IT. Both fit the same and are nice, but the black one is made from a lovely cotton fabric and the green is this awful,  cheap polyester that reminds me of swimsuit material. And it's not even a deep green like in the photos, it's more of a bright green (which I might like if it weren't for the gross fabric)<br />I still like the way it fits, but I'm returning it."
2.0,I decided to keep it because it was too late to order another one. Wore it once when we went to Disney and that would be it. Not flattering at all!
2.0,I was happy with the old case but the hinges wore out (like they all do) and it needed to be replaced. I figured I would reorder from my past Amazon purchase as my account has purchase history (thank you Amazon!). The seller shipped a case that is much larger (who has glasses that big?) and is shiny black. It is NO WAY leather. I don't want to hassle sending it back. Shame on you for not sending what the product description shows. Not ordering this one again.
2.0,"I received a dirty, torn package. Upon opening package and taking bands out of package the bands looked like they had been in someone's attic for a 100 years. Luckily with a little hard work and hot water they are usable."
2.0,"I loved this watch at first, then the bezel came off, got it fixed, but of course now it not only is not water proof, but fogs up with normal wear. Then... a piece of the clasp breaks. Haven't fixed that. So I can't wear it. It is pretty, but pretty cheaply made especially for he price you pay!"
2.0,Initially loved the socks but got a hole in them after 2 wears :/
2.0,Many charms were damaged and there were far too many duplicates.
2.0,"Mine suddenly started burning my hand at a single spot and can no longer use them. It got really uncomfortable and distracting. Also, the electricity is not regulated so it can get really hot when engine is at high rev."
2.0,"The description clearly says comes with two additional links, but only one is included. Even with the one link it is still too small. With two it would have fit. Very disappointed in that, plus the fact that it arrived late."
2.0,My son said that they felt uncomfortable and very stiff in the toe area.
2.0,"While this top is cute, it's thin, runs large and is extremely cheaply made. I don't expect it to last very long at all and it's much lower quality than similar tops from other sellers I've ordered. Because it is a cute shirt, I'm going against my better judgement and not sending it back."
2.0,"Loved the concept, couldn't untangle them out of the package, had to throw them out..."
2.0,"First one I got had the slit through the T way to far down and made the T sit upside down because it was top heavy, second is fine but super fragile. Any small tug will brake this. Worth cheap price tho."
2.0,Would not recommend. Not as sturdy or durable as apple original band.
2.0,I found these leggings to have a strong textile chemical odor which irritated my nose and skin.
2.0,Is large no like
2.0,We called the company and was told this was the same insole as what originally came in the boot.  This was not the case.  It was way thinner and not as comfortable.  Would not buy again.
2.0,The fit was good but the material was not all that great so I returned it back.
2.0,too small. I thought if I got a bigger size but it was still toooo small. I gave two stars because they shipped very quickly and the product was exactly as you see but its smaller and not for curvy women at all.
2.0,"In the photo it looks like it will be large anough to sag back towards the back of your head. Truth is, the hat is so small that it simply fits snug down on top of your head like a regular bowl hat - and on top of that, it floats up because it’s so darn small. I don’t think I have a large head either that would make it do that. It definitely will not do what the photo looks like, once on your head! Nice material - nice dense hat - but totally too small!"
2.0,"Way too small.  Did NOT fit like the other pants pictured. This is a very different, very small pair of jeans. I should have returned them."
2.0,The lens have a nice tint. The problem is that the nose piece reflects from the sun on to the lens making it appear that there is something on the lens.
2.0,"The roosters beak is missing, which is one of the most important factors on this bird. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Product is good quality.  Problem is they only sent the pants and no shirt.  Contacted the company whose response was to send it back for refund.  I wrote back to send me the shirt, as there was no problem with the pants.  They never sent the shirt."
2.0,Much thinner than expected. Picture is very deceiving!
2.0,I am a bit disappointed in this.  I thought for over $20 this would be much thicker and higher quality.  But its really thin.  I expected more from a high-priced strap like this.
2.0,"The sleeves are awful—they fit tightly even though they look loose and comfy in the photo. The dress does not look as pictured. I have somewhat muscular arms, but I can’t comfortably wear the dress because of the sleeves. I should have sent it back."
2.0,A very cute outfit but it faded out in spots on the first wash. I am very disappointed in the quality.
2.0,I had to return it. Skirt fit great but the top was too big
2.0,"Not too happy with the shirt it looks nothing like the picture. Like the fact that it’s thin, so that it’s not too hot but I will only wear it around the house because it doesn’t fit or look like the picture.  Not sure of going small would improve My opinion on the shirt."
2.0,"This product has the potential to be a 5 star all the way across but it is not and will not be until Steven G- Designs takes note of the misleading description and makes one simple<br /><br />change.<br /><br />The Good:  It is an excellent looking bracelet and very well weaved.  The quality appears to be great to superior quality. It also comes in a very nice and elegant gift box.<br /><br />The Bad:  Unfortunately two things ruined it for me.<br />1.  The bracelet is advertised as &#34;adjustable&#34;.  Here is the problem the clasp portion of the barrel does not allow you to lock it in to place. I am very familiar with outdoor gear and equipment and tried multiple ways to make it work. Of course I adapted and attempted to wear it around my ankle<br />during a short mile walk.  It became too tight and eventually started cutting into my ankle (turned it to both up and down side of cutter).  The SIMPLE SOLUTION:  The barrel portion of the clasp should be a &#34;locking&#34; barrel.  This will pretty much eliminate any problems as far as adjustment and proper fit.<br />2.  Second problem:  I contacted Steven G- Designs via email.  They informed me that it may be an issue that my wrist is too small.  Huh? This really left a bad taste with me as I felt the blame was being placed on me.  They made recommendations that I could attach it to my bag or pack.  I want it as a functioning bracelet as it is advertised as a &#34;bracelet&#34; and not an accessory.<br /><br />In the end Steven G Designs was courteous, cordial and professional in all electronic correspondence and eventually refunded my money.  As mentioned earlier in my review, this a very nice bracelet and has the potential of being a consistent 4 to 5 all the way across.  It bothers me that I have very little use for it at this point unless I put the effort in finding a locking barrel or altering the bracelet.  Unfortunately I don't have the time for that.  This is why I gave it a two - no functioning or practical.  Everything else is great."
2.0,"Just what I wanted in thickness. I am 5’5”<br />Way too short in length & rise, felt like a child’s size.<br />I wish your site gave more product information"
2.0,"The fabric and color of this t-shiry is beautiful. Soft, deep plum jewltone Heather. Bright white print. Love all that. BUT: it is sold as a ""womens"" t-shirt, so you would think it is a womens fit shirt. No. This is a regular unisex sized shirt (mens). Not a womens fit. Sleeves & length too long for a women's fit, but would still have length issue. I wear a large in a women fit T (medium, size 10). I'm swimming in this large and would probably need a small to fit correctly. Even washed it hoping to get the shirt to shrink. No luck. Giving it away. Sadly, will not reorder. :("
2.0,Definitely not for tall girls! 5’10 and much too short. Very cute though
2.0,too sm
2.0,Doesn’t fit to size. Too large
2.0,These come unclasped very easily
2.0,"they should have listed it as a crop-top.  also the fabric doesnt give at all, so it's uncomfortable.  has only been worn a few times."
2.0,I returned them. They are not as oversized as I would have liked them and they fit very snug. I had a headache after wearing them to watch a soccer game.
2.0,Infant sizing and not as described.
2.0,Very cheap quality. I wouldn't spend more than $3 for these. They really were worthless for me. Flea markets have better options.
2.0,Really awkward fitting.
2.0,"The Hugitout (14kt gold plated) layered necklace is cuter than I expected. The color is pretty, rose gold. It’s very dainty. You have two strands that create a really cute choker. The lower strand is interspersed with tiny letters, D’s and C (which works out since those are my sons’ initials). The upper strand has a few cubic zirconia clusters, which accent the entire design. The chain is about 16in with the built-in extender. This necklace looks lovely with tops or sweaters that have round necklines. It will appeal to all ages (from teens to adults) and will complement most outfits. I have sensitive skin and liked the fact that even though this is costume jewelry it did not irritate my skin (nickel free & lead free). And finally, if you want to give this as a gift, it is perfect because it comes with a cute box, a cleaning cloth, drawstring bag and thank you card (from the company).<br /><br />**Note: After wearing this cute necklace twice, it broke. Unfortunately, I couldn't determine how to contact the seller to see about a replacement. Therefore, I reduced the stars from 4 to 2. If it were more durable, it would definitely get my original 4 stars."
2.0,"these were a gift and my husband did not like them, they were a bit big and much longer than they appear in the picture. My husband is 5'11'' and they went past his knees so we returned them."
2.0,it's small though it was bigger that's the downfall
2.0,"My intention was to use for a couple weeks while my eyes recovered from surgery and may not wear contacts. The second time I wore them, a lens fell out. I got it back in, and then the third time I wore today, lens fell out again. You'd think something could last for a couple weeks!  On the positive side, they come with a case and a wipe cloth. There's also a little bag they could be kept in, but they definitely need to be kept in the hard case. I had an ancient pair I'd kept in my car for years that I thought I'd use, but they are too scratched up, so got these. The lenses never fell out of the ancient ones.  Spend more for a quality pair if you intend to use regularly!"
2.0,The shape looked awkward because of the side extending back to the ear.
2.0,"I put this on and it was really soft and I thought I would like it until I washed it. It shed on all of my clothes in the same load. So annoying! Even now after I returned it, I am still picking the fuzz off my clothes and it has been 5-6 loads after I washed it. I returned it because of that."
2.0,is not the picture that you see. Fits kind of big and loose
2.0,"I put this on my lanyard, but the chain broke, so lost it and my key."
2.0,Very thin. I would get again...
2.0,The sizing is really off... I couldnt even wear this dress!!
2.0,"A major annoyance with mask wearing has been the fogging of my eyeglasses.  So I bought Debatlog Anti-Fog Spray and treated my glasses as recommended.  After a couple of weeks use involving several treatments, I found that it does lessen the fogging.  But not much and not for long.<br /><br />I've since bought some molded N95 masks and they limit the fogging far better -- and are more comfortable to wear.  Problem solved -- but NOT by this product."
2.0,"Ordered the ""bride and groom"" masks and the quality of the print was terrible. Hard to read and far too large and the color was not gold but more of an orange/yellow."
2.0,Meh it's ok
2.0,They were just too small for my glasses.  I wish there was some kind of guide so I could have known what size to order.  My glasses are quite small and frameless so I though these would work.  Didn't like that it cost me return shipping to find out they wouldn't work for me.
2.0,This dress doesn't to as how it is on the picture
2.0,The back does not cover enough. I’m a size 2 and bought a medium. I’ll maybe wear them at home by the pool but not anywhere else. Amazon has gotten strict about returns so I’ll keep them but they are a waste of money in my opinion.
2.0,Gold plating applied to the elephants was not nearly as neat as on the pictures. Besides it wore off completely after just ONE wear.
2.0,Not what I expected not right in size very tight fitted
2.0,"Not very polarized, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,They are HUGE and do look very fake and cheap.<br />Dont buy
2.0,Wife has ALS could not put it on.
2.0,I bought these in 5T for my son (wears 3T or 4T). I hoped we would use them again next year but the pants have faded and worn at the knees after only one wear. (See pic) They are also a bit short for 5T. The top is very very soft and has held its color. I needed them for “Holiday PJs” event at his school so I would probably still have bought them even if I knew this.
2.0,The material felt like a formal design.
2.0,"This is way cuter in the picture/  I am tall and slim and it fits horribly.  Very, very short.  Very tight at the waist and yet very large at the bottom.  Quality of the fabric is fine, but the way it was sewn is not.  Would probably be best for someone very short, with a tiny waste and big legs."
2.0,Didn't realize that they would be so dark.  Really wanted something for indoor use.
2.0,"The description says genuine leather...the reviews had confidently said its leather, however, when my band finally came in I immediately began to inspect it.<br /><br />Sweat proof? Literally means it isn’t material that’s originally of animal skin or cow hide. All leather—even ones that are chemically assisted to ward off liquids—have to absorb water instantaneously. If research is done right, you find out leather cannot really be water proof. I tapped some water into the band to see the liquid behavior. On this “leather” water runs right off; not a spec has stayed on. Another factor of leather, one who would care, would notice is the hair pore discrepancy. All cow hide or animal skin as strongly defined microsised freckles or hair pores that may never be covered or withered by leather dye (nature of durability in leather). The back side of the band has impressive wrinkles but no[natural] hair pores.<br /><br />How was I able to incript all this? I collect leather and see the price of this watch band.<br /><br />But hey, if your into the looks rather the authenticity then this band is actually pretty cool. Me however, I will be returning the watch band tomorrow and will be sticking to genuine products from sellers who do not lie. Thank you."
2.0,Too small and very thin material. I wouldn't feel comfortable working out while wearing it.
2.0,"This was for a first grader. The graphics were important to me, and it did NOT include the different Batman themed wallpapers/watch faces as advertised. It just has three blue and black extremely basic graphics. Terribly disappointing!!"
2.0,The fabric is so horrible
2.0,It is beautiful dress but tight in the middle.
2.0,The design of the earnings cause them to flip and back to be shown. The backs are also pretty hard to secure.
2.0,Retuned too big
2.0,"Despite reading reviews and attempting to order the right size, this product is too small."
2.0,"It’s a polyester mess, looks extremely cheap. Returned."
2.0,"Lens are great, noise guard not so good"
2.0,This dress is great if you have a lot to hide it was a bit frumpy and her parents and hid everything about my figure<br />Definitely on a comfortable end
2.0,"I ordered the 7/8 Medium, but the shirt is closer to a 6 Small. My granddaughter wears 7/8 Med in everything else, but this shirt is too small for her. I was very disappointed that the size chart was not trustworthy. The shirt was for her birthday this week along with other Shopkins items and now I can't give it to her."
2.0,These leggings will NOT stay up!!! I walk 3 steps and the waist starts rolling down. SO annoying.
2.0,One side shorter then the other kept going up on one side
2.0,The fabric is very nice and durable I took  stars off beacuse a little stain by the jewel and not crown.  I read all the reviews before buying and did order a size up and fit my little one perfect
2.0,"They are pretty but very small. They looked much larger in the picture of the person wearing them. Great for a child or person with small/thin earlobes. Ad said they are 18K White Gold with Swarovski Element Crystal but no document of this in the box the earrings arrived in and no marking on the earrings to indicate they are 18K White Gold. The crystal, if they are in deed genuine crystals, do not reflect the light as a crystal should so I question the authenticity. Also, Made In China. Would have been nice if seller indicated that in description. Earrings are cute, but not what I expected, not true to the picture/description, and not worth the money I spent on them. Should have only cost maybe $5.99."
2.0,Beautiful ring but after 3 days the stone fell out. Disappointed 😞
2.0,"Necklace was tarnished/scratched upon arrival- not acceptable as a gift. Will be returning and placing an order for another one. Will update review then. Necklace is shorter than expected due to chain stopping at girls hands, but is still nice."
2.0,"Too tight around the face, uncomfortable after a while of wearing it."
2.0,"It fits perfectly fine, but it has very heavy smell, have to wash it and leave outdoor for couple days before use it."
2.0,Everything looks great with them except the lukes logo is orange and it's supposed to be yellow. Very disappointed and I don't understand how this is a licensed product.
2.0,"I bought this for my tragus piercing because it’s very cute. Not only could I not push the plastic through, I lost the ball within 2 days. So much for that....."
2.0,Its soooo Tiny. Very thin.
2.0,The &#34;E&#34; in little and middle look like a &#34;C&#34; instead.
2.0,the band did not fit. it fell off even with the screws.
2.0,They turned my toe green.
2.0,These are entirely see through
2.0,These are super cute but more for a teen rather than an adult. They didn't fit right and I looked pretty silly so I gave them to my daughter instead.
2.0,Larger than expected. Little stiff. Havent washed it yet. I washed it. It did shrink down 2 sizes. Thats why i bought big.  Its just ok. Nothing to write home about.
2.0,"poor construction, but cute. There were loose seams, and mixed matched/discolored fabric panels."
2.0,"I purchased this product for my daughter.  The lid leaks.  We use it without the lid.<br />Don't think I would get another one.<br /><br />-Germantown, MD"
2.0,"Nice shirt, but way, way too large.  Sizes not true.  Husband usually wears 2XL and XL fits him fine in this one."
2.0,"The head is really large, much larger than I would like, but since it's a gift, I'll see how the recipient likes it."
2.0,the shoe is a size nine but the fit is too loss and the
2.0,This dress is see through
2.0,One size does not fit all. These would be great if they had more stretch to them.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, and some of them I do. They are extremely inconsistent in sizing, some are properly fitting like a traditional boxer, others are snug like trunks, and one was very tight - the size difference is extremely apparent just looking at it.<br /><br />One of the ones that fit well had a very large number of threads going from the top to the bottom of the fly like guitar strings that I had to cut out, another pair that fit had a very messed up button hole, but no button - it didn't fall off, it never got put on in the first place, and I'm not sure a button would be able to go through anyway.<br /><br />I bought these for sleeping in, and only two of them fit well enough to do so. The two that fit like trunks I could possibly see wearing under pants, and the two that are way too small are basically rags. All of them are labelled large.<br /><br />All of them have the plastic tag hook punched through the knit fabric on the garment side of the seam, rather than through a tag or through the surged seam, so I expect them to develop runs.<br /><br />I believe that these are factory seconds, and for the price I guess I can't complain too much. I got two pair of usable sleep shorts for a fairly good price. Of course, I paid for 6."
2.0,Very thin material and uneven wide neckline.
2.0,"It is a nice bathing suit but it runs so small. I ordered a small at first and it was very tight. The next time I ordered a large and that was also too small. I believe I would need an XXL to fit comfortably, but the sizes only goes up to an XL. I am 5'5 and weigh 135 pounds. The suit was tight around my butt area, which made it uncomfortable for the front area.  I was able to return it twice and receive my refund within 2 days. Fast service! Hope this helps :)"
2.0,"I am disappointed because I ordered a half size bigger than I need based upon the description provided.  I didn't realize they shipped from China - so it took FOREVER to get them, and once I did and found they were too large, I can't return them because it will cost more to shop them back than I paid for them originally.  Hopefully someone at Good will will be able to use them because I sure can't.  A waste of $26."
2.0,Runs a bit small especially in the tushy area
2.0,Cute dress but the material is very thin. I can’t wear it during the day.
2.0,The quality was a 7 out of 10
2.0,One side of the collar is too large leaving an unattractive bulge at the neck.  The fabric is nice.  Will be returning for a replacement.
2.0,Not true to size . Too small. Disappointed.
2.0,I ordered an XL because I'm between a size 14 and 16 and was hoping for a looser or &#34;flowy&#34; fit.  The description said &#34;classic fit&#34; but it's actually a fitted fit.
2.0,Bought a size small and the item wasn't small at all. More like a medium.
2.0,wear mine everyday
2.0,Cute but I've only had it in for about a week now and it has already lost a stone...
2.0,Almost see through. Very thin material
2.0,Colors not as a picture. Arrived unclean and damaged at the edge.
2.0,Missing the dots!  they are just red!
2.0,"Cheap glasses with great packaging<br />My god it'd be better to wear the box than theses Crappy dime store Oakley knock offs. Ads slick,pics awesome but the reality is they just ain't what they say.<br />I got the pythons..Boxed like they were special..all military grade. Open it up then LOL. No way....Big Lot shades.  back they go. Save your time and money. So Ok many other choices."
2.0,Its pretty but also a little big not something I want to wear all the time .
2.0,"Sunglasses were very nice, until I went to the beach.  The sea water that splashed on my glasses, left an ugly shadow on both lenses."
2.0,"The stones don’t stay in very well.  My son got this his for his birthday,  the stones have fallen out several times and now the green one is missing and he is broken hearted.  After less than 24 hours the thing he was most excited for is broken."
2.0,Cute but didn't hold a smell at all
2.0,"I was excited about these shoes, but they are very poor quality.  They were broken almost as soon as they were taken out of the box.  I expected more for the price.  They should at least hold up through normal use~"
2.0,"Not for plus size person. No support, not comfortable. If you have large breasts, this bra is not for you. It’s like a sports bra. If your smaller with a or b size cups, maybe. Thin material and runs small."
2.0,Cheaply made. Lace strings were everywhere. Material is super thin. Not great for bbqing.
2.0,"The hat is made well, but the plastic that protects child's face is floppy, short, and foggy even when recently wiped or worn. This only gets 2 stars for the hat quality."
2.0,This doesn’t fit my son at all
2.0,Small and not very stretchy at all. I wear between small(womens) and medium(juniors) and it's way too tight. I can bearly get it over my 36&#34; bust. Best if you're a slim person. Also it is very see through.  You will NEED an extra layer. Otherwise cute.
2.0,I wish I had read reviews first on the fabric and look of this dress
2.0,Center birthstone fell out in just 2 months not wore all the time
2.0,Earring back came off the first day didn’t stay in my two year old ear at all
2.0,"This item arrived on time and I like the way it looks, but the writing is so small you almost need a magnifying glass to read it.  I purchased this as a gift for a friend of mine who is going thru cancer treatment for the second time so I was pretty disappointed to see that the inscription was so tiny."
2.0,Discomfort
2.0,Comfortable.  But runs smaller than expected.
2.0,"I seen the picture of this necklace, but didn’t expect that it would be very small once on. It’s not like the picture because the model has the necklace a little longer, but mines don’t get to that level. Looks very cheap made and not very stylish as the picture. I wouldn’t recommend it!"
2.0,"I wear dress size medium. I'm 5'6"" 140 pounds size 6-8. Pear shape. I'm really thin up top in the chest, arms, neck and this dress fits a bit snug for me. Not bad just not comfortable."
2.0,"THIS IS NOT A HOODIE SWEATSHIRT as the bold description and picture implies. Styled like a sweatshirt, but it's really just a thin polyester hooded shirt with a front pocket. Also, the graphics are dull and not 3D looking AT ALL (as depicted in the picture). If it wasn't so close to Christmas (it's a gift) I would absolutely return it! DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN."
2.0,dosnt look like the picture. u can barely see the writing on it unless it hits the light at an angle. not impressed with it. i wont be ordering from here again and definitely wouldn't recommend to my friends.
2.0,Small was too large.  More like a medium.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 109 lbs.
2.0,"Looks nice in pictures but in person you can tell it’s quite cheapish. If it were $5 I would have kept it but not worth more than that. The buttons were slightly crooked but that’s not a hard fix to pick them off and resew them since they aren’t functional buttons. Also, not being functional buttons, just floating there randomly makes it look cheap as well. Maybe if you cut the buttons off or use this as a base to top to add creativity to it would look better."
2.0,"Not comfortable to workout in. But good to wear under clothing, but noy comfortable."
2.0,I really like the look of this watch strap....and the leather is very soft. Unfortunately the strap when wound twice around slips under the watch sensor on your wrist because the strap is so thin and it breaks contact with your skin and the watch and locks you out. I was constantly having to re-enter my password on the watch all day long. I got so tired of doing this I won’t wear the band any longer. I ordered a watch band that stays put... unfortunately this good looking watchband was a waste of money!
2.0,"The shoulders of this sweatshirt fit fine, but the waist is much too large and long (well below the waist).  I am of average build, and this sweatshirt is just too baggy."
2.0,"I’m 5’6” and145# and typically wear a size 8/10.  I got this in XL and it just fits.  It is sewn nicely and the zipper works fine. The fabric is like a thin T-shirt and shows every lump and bump.  It’s weirdly shaped, loose in the midriff and tight on the shoulders. The length is just at the knee.  It’s just frumpy and weird.  I couldn’t even bring myself to post a picture of myself in it. I wonder how you can mess up such a simple style of dress.  Doubt I’ll ever wear it."
2.0,I ordered this bag because of the variety of compartments and separate shoe compartment which I really love. However; after unzipping the bag on the first day that I used it the strings came out of the plastic holders that they were tied to. After 3 days of use the entire plastic piece came off. I am only writing this review because I am not 100% satisfied with this product. I will update any future issues.
2.0,I like the rough cut stones and the medallions but the bracelet is very poorly constructed and fell to pieces. I will restring it with professional jewelers materials and will not purchase from this company again.
2.0,"They turned colors, after 2 weeks, they were not even gold &#34;looking&#34; anymore :-("
2.0,It’s pretty thin material. Not as flattering as I’d like. I got the dark green. I will be buying a slip to wear under.
2.0,Dye leaks!
2.0,The paint has been chipping of since I bought it.  Looks like crap now.  I work in an office and sit all day.  When will you have a more durable product.
2.0,"I knew it was small. But damn. The bead is verry hard to see. Due to its tiny size its very hard to see both the bead, and most of all the gem. The reason i get it."
2.0,"I used the medium suitcase for a short trip. Before departing from the airport the handle broke, which made it difficult to lift. Once I arrived at my destination and attempted to open the suitcase the zipper became stuck. After several attempts to open, I was successful.  Once I arrived back home I returned the item to amazon for a full refund."
2.0,Too big and hurt my ears. Very heavy earrings.
2.0,Fits perfect but you can see through I can wear the dress outside
2.0,Looked nothing like the picture.  Had to return.
2.0,"Product said off white, when I opened it, it was more of a tan/beige color. It did not look anything like the picture provided in terms of color. I did order a size bigger because of the description and it was still a little small. Product seemed cheaply made considering the price. Took a little while to get here but I was expecting that considering where it was coming from. However returning has not been a hassle at all. So I am grateful for that."
2.0,"they started to tear as I was putting them on, dissappointed"
2.0,"I love this co’s (Gihuo) cottony lineny overalls and have several pair. There is nothing more comfortable! I’m somewhere in the med-large range and order the Large, plenty big. They shrink a little each wash but I’m sure I could cure that if I damp dried them but I forget or I’m lazy:)<br /><br />The design of these overalls in another of their listings is little different and looked cute in the pictures and reviews convinced me to order up one size. When they came, they were indeed cute, color was good (a green) .. but the fit is very odd, like two separate patterns put together. An XL, the shoulder straps on their last button yet the bottom half of the overalls were huge in the hips yet slimmer in the legs .. I could tell they would not shrink to fit, they would shrink obviously in the same odd proportions. I have to return them and thank you Amazon for the simplicity of that.<br />I’m taking the time to write this because I personally rely on reviews and usually regret purchasing anything unless I’ve read through many of them. I also hope the co (whose other overalls I adore) -after seeing similar comments - might revisit this pattern and fix whatever is wrong."
2.0,This is not a sweatshirt. This is a long sleeve polyester t shirt. While I like the graphic it is not what was described. Also small is quite large. Not sure I will keep it as it is so big
2.0,"The watch itself is okay but it is sooooo NOT a kid's watch! It's HUGE, even on my husband's wrist! My 9 year old wears a watch daily and has for a couple years so, this is not our first time ordering one from Amazon but, this is the SECOND time we got a watch that was listed as &#34;children's&#34; and wasn't."
2.0,"This has a tight fit, not worth 60.00 at all...was going to buy more products but will not do so after getting this. Unfortunate, I was so excited"
2.0,"Fabric was too thin, and very see through. Super clingy. Returned"
2.0,"I liked them, but had to send them back because they were too small."
2.0,"Cute shirt and very soft but definitely runs about 2 sizes to small,"
2.0,I was a little cheaper looking that I was expecting.  I was wanting something with a little more presents to it so I returned this one.
2.0,"The fabric is thicker than I expected, and there's a white thread sewn through the folds on the above the breast on both sides.. like right on your chest..? The buttons on the sleeves are cute and the xl fit well on my size 16/40D self but I'm returning"
2.0,needs wider or stronger straps to support anything over an A/B cup--hangs low and open.
2.0,Unfortunately it is see through. I have to return. The color isn’t as expected. Overall dissatisfied
2.0,"Nice soft fabric, but they were really big in the waist.  I wear probably about a size 10 and they would stay up.  They are super stretchy.  I was going to send them back, but they have to go to China and they only cost 7.99."
2.0,runs very small and you fight for your money back
2.0,"I was super excited about these, but my toddler can’t wear them. They’re definitely GOOD QUALITY, however they rub my 4-year old’s feet raw no matter how much we loosen them. The little black piece that connects the straps to the shoe digs in to his foot so bad that he can’t even wear them with bandaids. We’ve attempted several times and even pushed through a few weeks of trying, but it never got better."
2.0,The skirt fit beautifully (maybe even a bit large) but the top was extremely too small. It looked absolutely lewd on. Skirt seems to be made well and with nice material.
2.0,Broke in less than a month :(
2.0,"Very disappointed in the color, from the picture I thought I was getting yellow glasses, instead the a very shiny gold, love that they are lightweight and the polarized lens are great"
2.0,"Although the fabric was nice, I’m not sure if it was marked wrong, but the 2x was more like a size large!  Hubby was disappointed because the print was fun!"
2.0,had some type of product on the front of it that would not come off!
2.0,The dress was well made but the belt was missing. That was a major part of the look of the dress. I was unsatsfied and returned the dress.
2.0,Feels very cheap and way too long.
2.0,"Updating my review: So, my daughter has had these since April. It's May. Four rivets have fallen out of the gloves. Disappointed in how his cheaply made they are!<br /><br />Bought these for my 8-year-old daughter. She's above-average in height and size. She LOVES these gloves. And was excited they arrived a day early! Totally satisfied customer. Cute, decent quality. Make me think of my child-of-the-80s days (Madonna, anyone?)."
2.0,There is no way that this shirt is meant to cover a pregnant belly. I'd love it is I wasn't pregnant.
2.0,"This is adorable. Unfortunately, it seems like the manufacturer failed to account for the fact that babies have big heads. The neck hole is tiny. Putting it on my son, I have to stretch it as wide as it'll go, and I still have to actively pull it over his head.<br />This would be okay if the material were stretchy. It's not. It's that heavyweight tee-shirt fabric.<br />How about a snap at the shoulder or something, Carter's? I expect more from a company like this.<br />Cute, I wish it were practical."
2.0,"product arrived very quickly, I'll grant the seller that! but it was far too big and the fabric is quite flimsy and synthetic, although it is a costume, so the fabric quality is not so terrible. I planned to send it back and then order a smaller size, but then it became clear that the returns are not done via Amazon (who have an arrangement with DHL where I live, so returns are at no additional cost). I did not see clearly on the product page that the fulfillment was not via amazon, so I was surprised and very disappointed! Seller did not offer any alternatives for the return. Therefore the prospect of return became far more complicated and expensive. for this reason, I did not end up sending it back and had the whole thing taken apart and resewn to make it fit properly."
2.0,"with only 3 times worn and 3 delicate washes later, holes and snags throughout the shirt were present and noticeable. I bought this shirt for my husband and he absolutely loved the fit style and colors. Too bad this is made of cheap material. Didnt realize I missed the return window either. Poor quality material overall. Im going to have to donate this shirt now."
2.0,"There is no stretch, no spandex, nothing to add stretch to this fabric.  The description claims they updated the fabric and added some stretch.  Not true. Otherwise I would like it."
2.0,"I had purchased this item through Zullily for much less. And glad I didn't spend that much on it. My daughter got the mermaid one. It is very cheaply made, and of poor quality. And it took forever for the chemical smell to go away. The jacket is basically a plastic poncho. Not made to the last for sure."
2.0,Ordered 2xl. Normally wear Lg. Still too small.
2.0,Very pretty design but offers NO support at all.
2.0,For something this long a slit on one side would allow more ease of movement.
2.0,"Looks nice on the website, but when you get it, you'll realize it's cheaply made AND it looks super cheap.  The plastic stones are not as vibrant as in the pictures.  The &#34;gold&#34; chain has a rusted look to it."
2.0,This was a beautiful bracelet but you couldn't appreciate it as it was always turned under your wrist. I bought it for my husband but we did not like the fit.
2.0,"HUGE! I have other Adar scrubs and these don’t compare. These are the lowest quality. I suppose for the price, that’s what you get; cheap material. No stretch. Scratchy. My other Adar scrubs are IDENTICAL to Dickies scrubs so I was expecting these to be similar to the Dickies Unisex scrubs; they are not. These are plain with no shape. I do like the color I purchased."
2.0,Button fell off after a week. :(
2.0,"Socks cute as they could be, yet extremely tight and thick, very hard to put on and squeeze legs too tight so I can't wear them.  I really hoped they would work for me but I just can't use them."
2.0,"Cute top. There's buttons on the front and 4 strands to secure top. One on front & back and left & right. But I am larger chested, the buttons on the front have gaps in-between buttons. As anyone knows, that is the last look you want from a top🤦. I was thinking it may be okay over a crisp white shirt underneath. I'm gonna try it. The back has a ripple material that give the shirt conformity as it molds to you. Machine wash cold delicates(or hand wash) & line dry. Difficult care instructions for a top that doesn't fit in any sense or the word. Wanted to really like it, alas that is not happening. Short, too short unless you have something underneath."
2.0,"Its cute but I felt like I'm wearing a pajama, still going to wear it tho"
2.0,"Strap on overall isn’t long enough. Legs are super long, too tight in the crotch area"
2.0,The cuffs are waaaay to big even if it’s worn by a big tall guy 🙄<br />And so is the collar.<br />Buttons immediately coming off upon touching.<br />I eventually use only the tail and the bunny ears. So for comparison between the quality of items in general vs the price? It’s not that great.
2.0,Will return for bigger size and hopefully all the buttons intact
2.0,When I saw these I immediately purchased because i am ALWAYS losing the other sock in every pair I buy. I was SO excited to put these on all my socks but noticed when I wore them sometimes I would feel it poking into my foot :( when I decided I didn’t want them on anymore I tried to take them off and literally couldn’t get them off so just threw the socks away :( Ways they could improved would be making the sides rubber and having a easy way to remove them!!
2.0,"This is almost like a shiny Lycra material.<br />I had purchased one very similar that was 100% cotton that I love.<br />This one however,  is just going to be used as pajamas by one of my daughters."
2.0,"The product arrived on time but looks like been used and then re-packaged again. The box containing the lenses was not sealed. The cleaning bag was dirty and stuffed into the product box. It seems with free returns offer, the lenses just get ship to another customer, after been return.<br />Lens quality: very thin compare to original lens. No sticker indicating 100% UV protection or polarized on the lens itself when it arrived."
2.0,"I received the wrong color too and should of read the reviews. While I understand the print will be different, solid print was not what I bought"
2.0,It's too big.  Even if the smallest setting worked it would leave a piece of leather sticking out from it with two holes in it.  You get what you pay for though.  I'll throw it in the Halloween costume box.  Not worth the effort of sending back.
2.0,"I am giving these 2 stars because the fabric is terrible.  I deliberately ordered corduroy pants because corduroy is a heavier, sturdy fabric.  These pants are very thin and almost, almost, sheer.  Very poor fabric.  I am giving some stars because the color is okay and they fit.  Although the pant legs are huge, like bell bottoms or palazzo pants.  Disappointed but too much of a hassle to bother to return."
2.0,Very poor quality. Only one pair is worth wearing (which is why I have given it at least two stars). Some don't even stay clasped closed. Costume jewelry has better quality jewelry. Fairly disappointed
2.0,This leggings is very transparent and long
2.0,not what I expected.  way to big and can tell made cheaply with glue showing.  unable to return due to my granddaughter wanted to wear them out of the package  would not purchase again
2.0,Appearance is nice but after wearing 1-3 times we had to glue one of the pearls back onto holder. I’m assuming that we got a bad one and most people will not have this problem.
2.0,"Not very sticky to my skin, could not be fixed on my skin,very easy to fall, not easy to clean."
2.0,The fabric is very thin and cheap!
2.0,"When I received the jacket there were MANY loose strings all over. There are inseams that are fraying since it was not made properly. It feels cheap and way too expensive for the poor quality. I bought a nice denim jacket from Target for less and it is truly great quality.<br /><br />Also, most jackets have inside pockets but this one does not because they did not sew the bottom so you can’t hold things inside. No attention to detail.<br /><br />Overall, it looks nice and has a nice fit but it is very poorly made."
2.0,This was a gift /Was not what I expected ... Very  inexpensive!!!
2.0,"otherwise, dress is cute<br />I'm 5' 2.75&#34; tall, over bust 32&#34;, under bust 30&#34;, shoulders 37&#34;, waist 25&#34;, armpit to wrist 18&#34;, bottom of neck to waistline down back: 15.5&#34;, hips 31&#34;.<br />got 0/2 (S) and it would have fit perfectly if the zipper worked."
2.0,I am a big fan of Polarn o pyret but not this time. The gloves’ lining is not properly fixed inside the thumb thus my son could not put them on by himself. Bought another brand.
2.0,the stopper was bend.... i fixed it.  Its ok.
2.0,These don’t work well for incontinence we need some thing for that
2.0,It rally did not stretch kind of tight
2.0,It's cute. Comfy. But it's a bit big. And there is NO back whatsoever. It's completely open. You definitely need to be confident to wear it...ill be wearing it with a cardigan.
2.0,the jacket is small for the big boobs girls
2.0,it was not get farbic  and was too large
2.0,They run too big: don't provide compression at all; the waist is too high (grandpa-like); the legs are very long... The two things that I consider positive from this shorts are: the pockets (come in handy) and the elastic on the waist is very comfy... (if this would fit on my waist and not above my belly button)...
2.0,"1 out of 2 I recieved was great, the other not so much. See attached photo."
2.0,"They look nice, you get what you pay for though. They turned my skin green."
2.0,It did not fit well and was not as heavy as I thought it would be. Bought a different one.
2.0,fabric is cheap and the zipper is a pain! save your money
2.0,"Very thin, more for a pre-teen"
2.0,"Honestly for the longest time this is all I would wear and it would last a long time now they don't last two months guys what are you doing, get it together!!!"
2.0,"This wouldn't even fit me , I ordered an XXL based on previous reviews and still wasn't enough, if your body  is like the one of the pics then would fit you."
2.0,Why isnt the legs sewed all the way down this is so frustrating to me.
2.0,I love these sunglasses but I’m super disappointed that the coating wore off. I can’t wear them anymore because it is right in my line of sight. I’ve never had this happen to any of my glasses before.
2.0,FYI if you go directly to Mattey.com this Cowl is $100.00 any reason for it to be $199.00 ?
2.0,"These are SO adorable, but they ARE NOT STAINLESS STEEL! I was so upset to see a few of them already rust on my finger. Really upset because these are stunning. I’ve yet to see if al of them will rust, but in one day, 2 already have. Disappointed. False advertising."
2.0,The cap stained my pillow and sheets
2.0,"La tela es barata, y la talla muy grande"
2.0,"THESE ARE SUPER CUTE HOWEVER, SO MANY OF THEM DO NOT HAVE A MATCHING COLOR SO MOST OF THE PACK WAS UNUSABLE FOR THE EARRINGS I WANTED TO MAKE."
2.0,The zipper broke from the stitch 2 weeks after I brought it.
2.0,"I expected, based on the price to be heavier gauge vinyl, at least compared to lower cost items. Boy was I wrong, plus shorter than shown unless person was 5'."
2.0,"Bought the adult size and they are TINY! It was my fault, I mixed up the inches and centimeters when purchasing but these are so small they would never fit an adult! And if I want to return them I have to pay over $5! I’ll just eat the $10 and donate them, or get my dog to wear them haha"
2.0,I left it on my wrist for two weeks and it shredded.
2.0,Cute but within weeks the lens popped out and the nose pad fell out .  Cheaply made...maybe why these were low priced
2.0,After 1 wash the print was coming off
2.0,Chain broke before I wore it even once.
2.0,Regular wear for 3 months and they fell apart at the seam reinforcement at the top.  The straps also frayed.
2.0,"Well, I have been wearing these for months. I wear one hoop 24/7 on my upper ear. The rose gold has faded to silver and my hair gets caught in it. Bummed."
2.0,"No room to put to score credit cards, etc. Slots are way too small. Gave it away."
2.0,"Honestly, it's like wearing a Cinderella costume bottom made for an 8 year old. Just too short to reach your ankles and poofy like a ballroom dress. The ""netting"" on the inside (Like the netting inside of mens swimming trunks) is shorter than the outside fabric and pulls it in at the bottom giving it that bumped out stiff look."
2.0,Band is tight
2.0,Cute but they are really small I don't have big fingers and they are tiny
2.0,It  was beautiful however after one wear it broke while being worn. Just fell apart while on my neck. Disappointing
2.0,I got an XL cause I figured this was Chinese manufactured and I'm considered &#34;big chi chi's&#34; 34 DD it was still too small to button up the bottom 3 and overall it just fits funny. the sleeves are too small to roll up like the picture. Its just a No from me
2.0,"It was chunky, stiff and did not fit my watch properly. I had to return."
2.0,Jacket looks nice but sleeves are too short & hem isn’t sewn evenly
2.0,"The pair I bought are my normal size for shorts and they fit quite slim for the waist and legs. If you choose to buy these, definitely go up in a size."
2.0,"This would be a cute bracelet if there weren't obvious misspellings on the charms. One is supposed to say ""Mysterious as the dark side of the moon"". Instead, it literally says ""My6qrlo6 as tho dark 6ldo of the moon"". At first I thought it was a weird font, maybe? But some of the letters that should be used in the misspelled words show up correctly in other words of the sentence. Like the letter s in ""as"" is correct, but is a 6 in ""mysterious"" and ""side"". Weird. The other charm is supposed to say ""A girl worth fighting for"", but they spelled it ""warth"".<br /><br />UPDATE: I left a review with the seller about my disappointment in the charms, and they generously refunded my money. They said they would inform their warehouse about the misspellings. However, I see the seller is either still selling the item as is, or they fixed the problem but haven't replaced the photo of the original. Hopefully it's the latter. I ended up ordering the bracelet from another seller, and everything is spelled correctly on the charms."
2.0,Was not aware that this dress was a mesh dress. To me it's more suitable as a beach wear
2.0,Too many small pieces.
2.0,Broke after 6 wears
2.0,I searched repeatedly for large emerald green earrings to match a green velvet dress for a wedding. Unfortunately these though the right size were light green instead of dark. I hope my photos are useful. Some images have  the emerald green dress I wanted to match to these to so you all can see the difference.
2.0,Shorter than normal. The diamond are so small they go through my lip ring hole. Uncomfortable because they are so short
2.0,"It's very cute, but not high quality. I received it in a plastic baggie, I think it should be shipped with a little more care as the metal is very impressionable and can bend very easily. The fit is good if positioned right. I have really long hair so a plus is that it didn't get tangled up, which most things do! If you have soft hair be careful because if you don't position it right (too high or separate the two gold bands too far apart) it will slide up and pop off.<br /><br />After a few wears, I was pretty disappointed. The metal leaves an indent and sometimes green line across my forehead. It also it's very itchy to the point where I just need to take it off. It also left my skin oily, which is odd because my skin is almost always dry.<br /><br />I got a lot of compliments on it but I wouldn't waste your money on something you'll probably only wear a few times. There are better ones out there. Plus if you have a allergy to the metal like it did, it literally starts seconds after you put it on."
2.0,was expecting amazonite but they just looked very fake and somewhat like glass or plastic.
2.0,"Quality is poor, especially the inner sock.  You're better off buying a quality sock liner and separate merino wool sock.  These just don't hold up.  I do a lot of hiking and backpacking and these don't last.  The inner liner wore thin after 20 miles.  I also found them to be much less comfortable than separate socks and liners."
2.0,DO NOT BUY THESE.  They are not the color you pick and the material is NOT thick Jean material. It's a really thin cheap material and is nothing like pic.
2.0,"The buttons hang strange, and the material is very obviously cheap. Cute style and okay for wearing occasionally but overall not great quality pants."
2.0,Way to big in the chest area. It shows alot of side boob too. Unfortunately I have to return it.
2.0,Goggles leak on the right side. Do not suction to the face fully
2.0,The print is cool but I will never wear it because the material is rough and scratchy.<br />Very low quality polyester? not sure what it's made of but probably not linen as it says it is.<br />its ok if its synthetic but it should stretch a little bit or be smooth. Big disappointment!
2.0,It did not help me at all.
2.0,Smells Like Chemicals. Really thin and cheap.
2.0,The center design fell out after not even a month
2.0,Arms were short.
2.0,"Save your money for the Skims version, my fiancé had to return this and bought the Skims."
2.0,I'm very picky about my socks. They need to be soft yet durable with tops that don't lose their elasticity after washing. These socks are not thin yet not too bulky.<br />These ankle socks are excellent.<br />They are not too short or too long either. Great for casual daily walking or running with.<br />The toes have been developing holes very easily. And from a single wearing. This is unacceptable.<br />I have many other socks that don't.<br />I would not rebuy these. I've already thrown out two pairs.<br />Every pair has developed holes in the toe areas. Other socks that I wear haven't.
2.0,"Great design, but the arm sleeves are WAAAY too small.  I normally wear a L/XL, so I ordered an XL - which was very roomy.  Would have considered returning for a large, but the arms are waaaayyyy to small.  So small they barely go over my elbow.  Great item if the arms were the right size.  If you have very skinny arms - great purchase."
2.0,"Really blousy, but extremely small waist. Very odd fit."
2.0,This isn’t a one size fits all product
2.0,I bought the &#34;dark&#34; dress and found it cheap looking and disappointing. It fit well but the look was not great.  The bow looked nothing like the big drooping bow in the picture but rather like a straight thin bow tie.  The material keeps riding up the hips.  I was really excited about the classy looking dress in the picture and on receipt of the item experienced acute disappointment.
2.0,Loved these pants.. But the zipper completely broke a month after purchase. Not what I expected for price I paid
2.0,"Much more cheaply put together and the metal isn't good. 2 anklets were broken right put of their packages. At the price I paid, it really wasn't worth it to send back."
2.0,This thing is functional.  It's very thin.  The edges are unfinished (not hemmed).  The graphics (American Flag) not that impressive (the colors are very muted).  It's large enough for an adult.  Fabric is stretchy (good).<br />I think the manufacturing cost of this might be $1 (one dollar).
2.0,small was too large.kept the item but was very dissapointed in the size.
2.0,The band is cute but it got stuck!  I've only had it an hour and had to break it off!!  Don't waste your time with this!!
2.0,Poor quality — started shredding along the zipper immediately after I pulled it out of the packaging. Very thin. XL was tight when zipped.
2.0,Got the squashed heart version everyone else seems to get. But for such a small price... guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"The tigers eye ones are a size or two smaller than the rest, and one of the O rings on the backs arrived broken."
2.0,Uncomfortable.<br /><br />Belts too thin at the edge. Causing the belt to painfully dig into my pelvis when sitting down. Even though belt is loose.
2.0,"Six year old brother wanted this mask after his nine year old sister got one for her birthday and this was coming in one day so I ordered from this company instead. But I do not recommend this for children at all.<br /><br />Try the brand: WYH if you want this mask for a child. The description for this one is incredibly misleading, saying it's for kids and adults but it is definitely too large for children. The strap can be adjusted in the back but it's still a very large mask.  The other brand offers a cute child size Dream mask as well as an adult size.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars as there's nothing wrong with the mask but the description is inaccurate and didn't state that it's suitable for teens, adults and children with exceptionally large heads. Also, little man was delighted to have his own mask and doesn't care if it's oversized. Perhaps some children won't mind adult masks. I'm still getting a child size one for him from WYH and maybe I'll wear the large one for fun."
2.0,Not very good quality. Returned it.
2.0,"Mom wears a 2x, ordered up to 3x, still too small. Returning."
2.0,The product seems to be built well and looks even better in person. Problem is it runs super small.. I ordered her normal size and it is at least two sizes smaller therefor we had to give it away
2.0,"Loved the phrase enough to buy  DRESS, but this is SO short it is a shirt for leggins in public and a mini dress I would only wear at home in private for my husband. I am top heavy, wearing a 34DD bra and it is a rather snug fit on the top, but not uncomfortable there. It gets uncomfortable in length though. Allow me to explain.<br /><br />My husband hasn't seen me in a dress that short in 20 years. While HE liked it, this is a dress you cannot stoop down or bed over with without giving the public a show of regions of your body you may want to keep private.<br /><br />On the plus side, if I want to have fun with my husband the dress is a perfect tease - AT HOME!😊😉"
2.0,Quality wasn't that good.
2.0,"Returned it, I did not like the fit."
2.0,"The quality of the hat is good, and it is cute.  It is listed as ""women's"" hat, one size.  It is very small.  I can't wear it, but will give to niece."
2.0,"I was really excited about this product but it was broke and its a little to big for my wrist. The heart was heavy and big plus its looks a little cheap. Had to return, definitely not for me."
2.0,"Very spandex-y and tight...and I have long skinny legs.  I ordered an XXL, I am 5'8&#34; 175#  and these came up to my lower calf.  I can't really wear them, but it's more trouble to return them. 🙄"
2.0,It would have been a great dress except it’s really too short.
2.0,Initially loved them but after 2.5 months they broke
2.0,"So it feels nice, but this is NOT silk, unlike it's claims (obviously; it's $4, and silk is expensive), which makes me wonder if it's actually UPF 50 like the page claims. I gave it a shot since it was so cheap, hoping the tags would provide more information. There is NO care tag or sales tag to indicate what the fabric content is, whether it's UPF 50, wash instructions, etc. so I am very suspicious of this product's UPF claims. This would not be legal to sell at a US brick and mortar store without a care tag. I wanted to wear this instead of sunscreen on my neck and the majority of my face, but I don't trust it. Keep in mind cloth face masks generally have a UPF rating of about 7, and the minimum SPF sunscreen you should wear is 30."
2.0,Pierden muy rápido su compresión
2.0,"I got an allergic reaction to these leggings. Maybe it was the dye, but this really shouldn't have happened, especially since they were washed before I even tried them on. Amazon did give me a refund quickly so that was good."
2.0,They tarnish!!!  In a short amount of time :(
2.0,I received my necklace today; unfortunately I am disappointed.  It was actually packaged & shipped with a missing jewel.  I appreciate that this is costume jewelry and I was fore-warned with some of the reviews but was really hoping that my purchase would have been included in the 68% for a 5-star rating.  It is beautiful and I purchased it to compliment some of my casual jean out-fits; again it’s unfortunate that I will not be able to use.
2.0,"Bought this shirt for my 10 year old daughter, she's wearing a small/med in junior/womens shirts depending on fit. I ordered a large after reading reviews, still barely fit her. It'll work for this summer, good thing it was kind of cheap. It's cute, that's about it, will look good under shortalls."
2.0,Love everything about these EXCEPT... THEY ARE SO SEE THRU. You can see every little crevice in my skin. Every birthmark. Omg. Would never wear these in public. Only wearing these at home with my s/o.
2.0,"I have been buying x-large Russell's at the local stores and they fit good, I'm 6' 185lb and this sweatshirt was very large, maybe should have been label xx-large."
2.0,Different product than what I ordered last time. Not spring loaded lens and cheaper look/feel
2.0,Ordered two and one was broken
2.0,Turned my finger green and lost it shine almost immediately
2.0,Not sure about the quality but the logo came out good
2.0,I was expecting a loose fit on this dress.  It's way tighter than I expected.
2.0,CUFF AT TOP CUTS INTO MY ANKLE --
2.0,"Purchased the half moon earrings, did not expect much given the price but I needed these for an outing.  They’re very cute but kept falling off my ear. I had to keep pulling them up.... ended up breaking."
2.0,"Bought these for Christmas for my son, by February, the Velcro started breaking off and now, there is almost none left."
2.0,se despega muy rápido
2.0,I didn't like the fabric; it's very thin. It's very short and it rides up. It does hold the tennis balls securely.
2.0,"Beautiful color, shape, and style dress, but had to due to its sheerness. Even with a full slip you could see completely through the dark colored dress. I have the blue and red and they aren’t as sheer as this green one."
2.0,"Im not picky, and these are horrible.  the seam in the crotch is open and the material rough so it rubs your girlie parts...  Not good.  Definitely the WORST Fruit of the Loom product I have ever purchased."
2.0,"These are very thin. Not what I expected in a “compression” shirt.  Not comparable quality to the popular name brands that make compression shirts.<br />We may still find days they will work for, but they arent going to keep anyone very warm!"
2.0,I ordered the small and it was way too big. Fit wasn't flattering.
2.0,"Too heavy, solid!"
2.0,Okay pants if you only need to wear them once.
2.0,"My order stated a large.  When I opened the package, it was a small.  Do I have to pay for shipping to return?"
2.0,"Based on the &#34;runs small&#34; reviews, I was hesitant about what size to get. I normally wear XL in everything and according to the size chart, XL should have worked fine. Turns out the vest and jacket fit well but that pants are HUGE. The pants are about 5 inches away from my waist."
2.0,"Looks ok, nice colour combo. If you're going for the loose ""boyfriend"" watch look - this is definitely not it. This watch runs pretty small for even a female arm. Its also very light; my expectations may have been a bit too high for the cost. The Casio electro luminescence watch may be a better buy to get the ""boyfriend watch"" look I was trying to achieve."
2.0,So upset. Was so excited to wear these. Just received today and it has a stain on it. They are very soft and pretty material feels great. Just bummed about stain
2.0,It stretched so much that it no longer fit.
2.0,"Dropped once and stones fell out, had to return"
2.0,"Very sparkly and pretty, great length choices, too delicate for regular use.<br /><br />I wear this every day, but I am SO gentle with it. I always take it off before showering, or brushing my hair, and the charm I wear on it is small and light. Yet today it broke for no reason - it just came apart in my fingers (thank God I was home and aware the very moment it happened, so I didn't lose my pendant!) - and I've only had it for 4 months.<br /><br />It may not have been super expensive, but it wasn't super cheap either, and I expected it to last longer for what I paid for it.<br /><br />That said, it really is very pretty, and if you only intend to wear it occasionally, I would recommend it for that."
2.0,These are barely anklet height at best - don’t be deceived by the picture...
2.0,Gave as a gift to my friend as part of a pj bachelorette party and they split during her first wear....... disappointing
2.0,Unfortunately it was too small for me.
2.0,Cheaply made cut boxy returned
2.0,"It's cute but it fits a little weird in the arms.  I'll wear it, but it won't be a go to top."
2.0,"So this was shorter than I expected and I'm 5'3 and it doesn't cover my butt. Also I have big boobs (36G) so that does make dresses and shirts ride up but the straps are loose still, if I don't pin them they will fall off. It is cute but I'm gonna have to return it."
2.0,This hat pin is great with detail. HOWEVER is very small. Probably only 1/4 inch in size.
2.0,Way too short- the shirt barely covered my bra band.
2.0,Will not oder again ..to small
2.0,Very very very tiny. Might not even be able to fit more than a cell phone inside.
2.0,"Comfortable, lightweight, good material. However, the only reason I bought these was for the phone pocket. The first run I went on, my phone fell out. I have an iPhone XS. It fits in the pocket perfectly, but the pocket isn’t tight around the phone, so it slides around and bounces out when running.  I bought 3 pair so it wasn’t just one mis-produced pair. The phone fits the same in all three pair. The Phone Pocket needs to be tighter, or a zipper or Velcro closure needs to be added to it."
2.0,The material has a shine to it. I bought it last minute for a wedding so I had to wear it. I would have returned it otherwise
2.0,They have a weird lining that make them hard to put on and take off.
2.0,"I want to love these plugs but they have so many holes in them. No matter how much I clean them and my ears they still fill with gunk and stink, then no amount of washing makes them clean again. If it weren't for the holes all throughout them I'd give them 5 stars. Otherwise they are beautiful natural stones, came in the correct size, and fast shipping."
2.0,"It is definitely not ivory, it is yellow tinged and frayed around the edges. The sash is just a ribbon."
2.0,was damage and dirty when i received.
2.0,I could not get them to fit in my ears!
2.0,"It was not the color pictured. Daughter ordered and got the right color, but when I ordered the exact same dress, the color was not the same shade. Not going to work for a wedding to have different color shades."
2.0,It’s turning black in the inside and the gold faded away I’m very sad about this. And It doesn’t open up fully.
2.0,These are very cute but run small. They fit bc i ordered 1.5 sizes bigger and I had to punch another whole in the strap to keep them tight around my daughter’s ankles. The most concerning thing is the odor of plastic that these shoes emit. We keep them outside when my daughter isn’t wearing them bc I’m afraid of carcinogenic fumes.
2.0,NOT SATIFIED
2.0,"They look great, till they start to turn your nose green. What I get for trying to be cheap."
2.0,"I am usually a large, ordered XL...not sure this would fit a small boy"
2.0,"This cape really did not look like the picture. The fabric was thin and scratchy and the faux-fur was long and shed quite a bit. It looked very fake. Unfortunately, in this case, you really did get what you pay for. I would have worn it more as a part of a costume or something like that- but I did not end up wearing it to the wedding I purchased it for. The quality of the stitching was good, and the cut and style was nice, but the material was not satisfactory for an formal evening event, and you could see that from a mile away. If you are looking for a good quality garment, I would not choose this piece. If you are looking for a costume accessory and don't mind the black hair shedding all over the place, this is a good value."
2.0,I purchased this for my Samsung gear sport watch. The band was too wide and didn't fit. It looked like a nice material. It also was very long. The item was returned.
2.0,"I purchased this to replace my original case that came with a Bushnell V3 rangefinder.  This case fits my V3 fine - it's a little tight with the silicon sleeve that came with the Patriot pack, but I figured it would stretch out a bit over time, and I'd rather have it a tad snug than too loose.<br /><br />The magnet closure is perfect.  Since the strap broke on the original case, the magnetic flap is much easier than zipping and un zipping the old Bushnell case.<br /><br />The magnet clip works well to attach to a cart, and it held much stronger than I expected.  Even on a bumpy path, the magnet hung on.  This would be a total 4/5 star review however the loop that attaches the clip to the case ripped at the seam in less than 5 rounds.  It's the only thing on the case that's made poorly in my opinion, but unfortunately, it's also the only thing that keeps the clip secured to the case.  If you were inclined to stitch a seam or two, you could make this case perfect, but I'm no seamstress so I returned it.<br /><br />Amazon shipped me another case right away, but I was disappointed the loop broke so quickly in the first place, and I don't anticipate this loop lasting much longer..."
2.0,"The tulle on this tutu is the rough and scratchy type, not the soft kind. The tutu also came all bunched up rather than folded, resulting it in being wrinkled all over and since the tulle is the rough type, it was hard to make it nice and straight. Pieces were sticking out ever which way. I had to return it."
2.0,These are one sided so they are lacking especially when they turn around.
2.0,"Too floppy. I liked the pockets and vibrant color, but it just seemed to be saggy once I took the packing out and placed my things in it. Wish it would have worked, but I sent back. Still looking for the right one...."
2.0,"Very bad quality, felt like paper"
2.0,Not happy at all  this would be the 5th pair of snoozes I have purchased on amazon. This is the only pair that has the little bumpy non slip surface. All the others have a solid non slip surface. If I wanted a painful bumpy non slip I would g o to Wal-Mart and pay 1.99.  It should have been in the description and I would have not purchased.
2.0,"Super flimsy, its hot glued together and there were strands hanging off. dont stay in hair even when its teased and hairsprayed"
2.0,"Bought these for my son, the sole started coming unglued a month into wear"
2.0,I have large hips and thighs and this DID NOT look good on me. I wasn't a fan of the material and was told that I shouldn't wear again lol. I have only worn it once and its been in my closet since.
2.0,ITS SO SO
2.0,I would have liked it better if the material wasn't so thin. Have to wear a tank top underneath or else your bra will be visible.
2.0,I have a larger head an these were too small.
2.0,Cute boots but I'm normally a size 9 and I couldn't wear these more than 10 minutes without my feet being numb.
2.0,"Pros: Really responsive customer service.<br /><br />Cons: Awful quality control.<br /><br />TL;DR: I ended up trying 4 of these watches and in the end, none worked, so I got a refund and moved on.<br /><br />I got this watched and loved it! However, very quickly noticed that the watch didn't keep time. Every few days it would stop randomly for 30 min - a few hours and then after a few months it completely stopped working. I figured it was a bad battery causing all the issues so I took it to a jeweler and had the battery replaced. The jeweler told me there wasn't 1 battery but THREE. Crazy, right? Anyway, about a month after the batteries (all 3) were replaced, the watched stopped working for good. I contacted customer service, they promptly sent me a new one and I returned the defective one.<br /><br />The second watch -- the light didn't work right out of the box! WTF, that's why I was got the watch in the first place. Contacted customer service, they sent me a new one, I sent back the old one.<br /><br />Third watch - the light didn't work right out of the box again! This is even though a customer service person personally checked the watch before shipping it to me.<br /><br />Fourth watch - I asked them to send me a white faced watch instead, thinking maybe it was just the model was a crap one and going to their original style would be better....Nope, right out of the box the light worked (yay), but a week later, the watch 'lost time'. It has continued to do that occasionally since. I asked for a refund at this point - I am not confident that I will get a watch that works and tired of trying.<br /><br />If after reading this review you're STILL thinking of buying the watch -- go for a white face over the black one. When you use the light on the black face, the numbers light up - not the background - so you can't read the hands and the numbers in the dark at the same time."
2.0,These are great except they stretch out and tare
2.0,"Not the same as the picture. White valve... not black. The material slipped out from under the seal of the valve. I popped the valve apart and managed it to reattach it. But, just not made well. And not made as well as the picture alludes to. Must frustrating part is the false advertising. I don't respect those that use misleading pictures.Made in China. I was thinking because it was Prime it couldn't be from China."
2.0,The dress is extremely short.  Fits like a tunic top.  Does not fall to the knee as pictured.  It falls mid thigh.
2.0,The fabric is 96 polyester and 4 percent spandex.  The Nike website list 88 percent polyester and 12 percent spandex
2.0,Functional but rather ugly.
2.0,Doesn’t look anything like the picture very thin denim material and runs very small cheap
2.0,They look like 2 dollars sunglasses
2.0,"This product is not breathable whatsoever. Face gets wet too fast, and it is a little bit big (and I have a pretty big head) Material is cute but definitely won’t be wearing it"
2.0,very poor quality and material
2.0,Too sheer and cheap looking
2.0,"I own a few Swarovski crystal jewelry and this is nothing like it. In person its very yellow and the back off it has a some sort of a colord film type not very pretty. It’s very small and the bracelet looks pike it would easily break,  so unless your a young girl or have a very small wrist I wouldn’t recommend it."
2.0,"Bought these for grandson for school.  We tried them out during a shopping trip and within an hour it was severely  wet from spit.  He Is a small 11 year old so it’s not like he’s slobbering like a toddler.  It fit snug so anytime he talks, moisture stuck to the mask.  Passed them on to friends that have younger children to see if they work for them."
2.0,Material is flimsy.  Doesn’t fit as well as Amanda jeans.  Hips are much too large for a10.
2.0,"The clasp is not fitting on all wrist sizes. It is way to big on my girlfriend, who has average wrists, and is now just sitting there until she figures out what to do"
2.0,"I don't know who designs these bikinis but boobs are not in our armpits. These types of bikinis always seem to have way too much fabric on the sides and not nearly enough in the center. Looks really strange and gives the illusion of a very wide upper body.<br /><br />The pads that came with it are very thick and clearly visible. Seams are itchy and not stretchy. The top fits fine, but because of the lack of stretch, the bottoms are uncomfortably tight. I have an athletic build, 5'2 and 135 lbs, 32C bra size. Would not wear this for more than a half hour."
2.0,You kinda get what you would expect here. They look good and physically feel nice. But when you put them on you can really feel the low quality.
2.0,"The stone is not as bright as its shown in the picture and it's not light green, it's dark green, almost like black. And it is too small. I am not happy with this product."
2.0,"I was a bit disappointed that the dress is so sheer. There is no inner lining. I will have to buy a slip in order to wear it. Also, upon opening, it smells like very strong chemicals."
2.0,Too large and earrings were not the same size or color :(
2.0,Wrong shirt
2.0,these dang pieces do not fit my mouth properly nor fits all different masks. Just the standard throwaway masks so this product is useless and  never buy again! FYI the seller wanted then back when i returned it so which its not covid-19 safe.
2.0,I have ordered 90 degrees pants in size large in the past and I wear them regularly. The pair I received today was way too small. They fit my daughter and she typically wears women’s size small.
2.0,"I'm 5'8"", 150 lbs, small chest and medium fit well but roomy"
2.0,Very thin. Wore them twice and there's already a hole.
2.0,They run very small and are hard to put on the feet. Easier to take off when they are wet but hard to pull on when dry.
2.0,Ordered Large - did not fit my adult head :(
2.0,Disappointed. Very cheap quality....wasted money.
2.0,"i bought the suggested size, but too tight around my butt  and waist area.<br />i did not like this dress.  Not that well made."
2.0,"Nice shirt, but the sizing chart on the page was not even close to the size you typically see in the U.S."
2.0,These are small and itchy
2.0,"I thought this dress would have a rainbow look as pictured but the pattern has scribbly black stripes between the rainbow stripes and it just gives it a circus tent look. Also the skirt part is very large proportionally to the top, so the fit was just strange. Truly looked like a circus tent on. Also there are no belt straps to hold the belt in place."
2.0,"Tho the product was well packed and arrived promptly, it was limited in value to me. It seemed to somewhat reduce the glare for a week or two, but not enough to be helpful. I gave up on it, and am glad I didn't spend  much for the product."
2.0,"A little disappointed, the comfy memory foam sole goes flat really quickly and i bought them because the discription said they were “ washable” and after washing them once on the gentle cycle the sole is already pulling away from the shoe."
2.0,Super cute felt a little cheap and was definitely smaller then expected I ended up returning it and not purchasing another one
2.0,"It's pretty, nice color and I like the size, but I never wear it any more because it tarnished nearly instantly. Very disappointed."
2.0,Más transparente y pequeño de lo esperado
2.0,Cute shirt but way too long. I could wear this as a dress.. I ordered the flower one in my normal size L and it goes to my mid thighs.. so I ordered another one in a medium.. it fits the same way. So I’ll be sending both back. Not sure if I’ll be trying for the small or not!
2.0,"I like the cherry print, but the skirt of the dress is too short and too full. fit as expected, but it just wasn't flattering. the material is a shiny poly material. wish it was a cotton blend."
2.0,"I ordered small. The package said S/M . I  am a female and I wear a size 6 or 6 1/2 shoe. I am so dissapointed. I looked at your website and it appears that you have yoga gear for men, not women"
2.0,They're okay. Only got half the set.
2.0,Looks nice but is made cheap compared to authentic ones ive had before. Should be cheaper and will end up leaving a stain on your skin from the cheap metal its made if when wet.
2.0,"There are very few people who would fit this slip well because it is WAY too large in the bust.  I am not small chested but the chest is too large for me.  I was disappointed that the bust of this slip is too large and the hips are too small.  I cannot imagine the shape of woman that this would fit, as I am a 42DDD.  My bust is quite full and my waist and hips are not oversized.  It is very unusual for any garment to fit me in such a strange way."
2.0,"So cute! However, plastic button snap broke off the third time my daughter wore it."
2.0,Boi no
2.0,This bag is alot smaller than it looks online
2.0,It is very cheap looking . Not at all appropriate for the event I  purchased it for. The choker wasn't fitting well .<br />I will return this dress .
2.0,Tiniest bag ever..not a backpack
2.0,"Top and bottom are way too small but otherwise it is good, instead of returning it I gave it to someone who is smaller and it looks great on her."
2.0,"Looked great, but was a youth medium NOT an adult medium.  Now to find someone who can fit it."
2.0,The ruching is poor quality
2.0,Arrived with a 3inch hole in the top!
2.0,Kind of small. I do not like the very synthetic fabric. They are cute.
2.0,Two of the chokers the threads fell apart after the first time I wore them.
2.0,The yellow is very different then the picture and the straps broke after one use
2.0,It's not compressed at all. Too loose like normal tank top.
2.0,The glass lenses look like shiny plastic and they came a bit scratched.
2.0,"Rating this 3 stars. It is a nice dry fit BUT looks NOTHING like the picture! If my son didn’t want to wear this to school for his bday tomorrow, it would be getting returned! Don’t think it’s worth the price either... decal looks cheap. Would’ve much rather what the picture advertised."
2.0,The chain break easily.
2.0,"Prepare yourself to be the belle of the ball in this fire engine red dress made out of unlined swimsuit material.  Who needs a real hem when someone in the factory knows how to use a serger and just call it a day?  Paying $20 for a dress....well, that's what you get.  I can't say I expected better, just wanted to warn anyone else who thinks they are getting a deal.  If you sew and own nice foundation garments and accessories, you can pull this off without looking like a busted can of biscuits.  For me, it was true to size.  I will be placing a decent hem in it, and stuffing my mommy bumps and lumps into something spanx-esque to make it work. It's nothing a large scarf and a glass or two of wine can't fix.  Just beware, it's a handyman special."
2.0,Gem fell out 2 days of wearing
2.0,This shirt claims to be an XS but it's clearly a Medium in every aspect. It is gigantic and I'll be attempting to shrink it two sizes so my daughter can wear it. The material is soft and breathable. Very light but not see through at all. We live the quality but not the botched sizing😳.
2.0,"The size is small, be aware!"
2.0,"My husband laughed and told me I looked like I was playing dress up as a doctor. It does not look as chic as the photo. I purchased this through Prime and upon trying to return it the seller said I would have to pay to return it?? Now I see the item is ""currently unavailable."" SCAM!!!"
2.0,"Too small, not true to the calf....<br />nice socks but won't do if you have a cubby calf like me :)"
2.0,"Material was too lightweight for my taste. Color I ordered, blue, was beautiful."
2.0,They became discolored after two times wearing them.
2.0,"Pictures are deceiving.  Do not expect a shirt that has a lightweight or cotton like texture.  This is a great shirt if you are cosplaying as a member of the Starfleet Academy baseball team. Otherwise, do not invite disappointment."
2.0,Jacket was very thin fabric and wouldn't be able to wear in cold weather. Returned item.
2.0,"The dress doesn't look like the pictures. It looks and feels cheap but for the price its ok. Beware this is not a cotton nor silk &quot;wrap&quot; dress. You have to pull it over your head,  so if you have an average or above size chest area, it will be hard to get in and out of."
2.0,I gave these to my husband for Christmas.  It's less than 2 months later and they are falling apart.  He says they are Some of the most comfiest slippers ever but they are literally falling apart.  I only see returns on new unused items but I think these should last more than 2 months.
2.0,In 30 degree weather this gloves are cold while at a standstill let alone while biking cycling walking etc.  When in your pockets they're &#34;okay&#34; .  This is a spring and fall glove at best - under 40 degrees and not worth the money.
2.0,The size 11 is way too large for my 10.5 shoe size...
2.0,The sunglasses were not comfortable to wear and caused a blind spot.
2.0,Unfortunately a little too big even though I wear the same size in the Made in China version...
2.0,"I was asked if a hard eye glass case would fit inside ... thankfully, I bought Binmer(TM)Hot Compression Eye Glasses Hard Case Sunglasses Case Protector Storage Box black as well and it's very tight, but yes, it fits.<br />Note: the Tactical Molle sunglass case I received has a &#34;molle&#34; strap that has an &#34;adjustment&#34; buckle that does nothing!  It was not made properly, so it wouldn't attach. It has Molle positions where a molle clip can be connected to the (soft sided case, no it is not hard and would offer very little protection for your glasses) but it does not have a Molle strap that can be used to attach to Molle webbing.  I had to purchase Molle straps to attach it to the Molle mounting points on my pack."
2.0,"This &#34;tactical&#34; backpack uses poor materials.  Both buckles on the shoulder straps broke within two months.  My daughter uses this back pack for going to school, not what I would call a &#34;strenuous&#34; user."
2.0,I think it looks nicer in the picture. I don't care for it.
2.0,"The hat was kind of thin, but at this price, that's what i expected. Unfortunately the way it was packaged, the hat was crushed and creased. I'm nit about to accept wearing a crushed hat that I paid full price! Poor choice to ruin a hat through bad packaging!"
2.0,This item was super cute but super cheap. They were truly adorable while they lasted but all broke before the end of my daughters birthday party.
2.0,"Disappointed at the sizing. I first bought a pair from this company the Darling Ankle strap heel at a size 9 (.5 size larger than I normally wear) , and it was way too small, fit like an 8. THEN I tried to buy it in size 10, but they didn't have in black, but it fit like a charm. The color was a nude color and didn't match the New Years dress I'd gotten. So I found these shoes from the same company and the same size 10 except these shoes fit like a boat, an actual size 10. I'll be returning all three shoes and dissapointed at my wasted time. A little consistency would be greatly appreciated"
2.0,The small is perfect size but it’s hard to stretch out to put in and then stretch back down. Not my fave.
2.0,"I got an XX Large which is my normal size. It hits at the waist, not long like in the picture. The sleeves are SUPER short. That's not usually where I have issues with sweaters being too small, but this one is incredibly short sleeves, almost 3/4. Very disappointing as the sweater itself is super warm and soft."
2.0,I buy these types of gloves for compression and these were to big. Sleep d down my arm<br />I'll stick to stretch unisex gloves
2.0,"I love the bag but hated the color.  Too shiny/flashy, just not my cup of tea."
2.0,"unlike the pictures that are given by the sellers, these leggings I received have this weird dotted mesh across the back of the calves which was not pictured. the picture shows a smooth solid leg all the way down with the dots (which I dont mind)<br /><br />I wish the product I thought i was buying was the one I received... I was super excited about these and bummed out by the quality// lack of full description."
2.0,Dislike fabric
2.0,"Cheap, thin fabric with a very tight fit, even though I ordered it in my size.  I returned it.  The only good thing I would say about it was that the yellow was a pretty, clear yellow (without brown, orange or gray undertones).  For that reason alone, I wish it had fit better.  Even so, the fabric was very thin which is not a flattering thing for me."
2.0,I liked the belt but it only lasted a couple of weeks. The buckle broke.
2.0,Fabric  is cheap. Nice design
2.0,Color looks muted. Fit was on the small side
2.0,These shorts run to snug.  Ordered up and still uncomfortable.
2.0,Very well made caps but they shrink to an unwearable size after just one cold wash and warm drying. I bought two and can't use them at all.
2.0,Arrived with a stain and had to immediately return.
2.0,Cute but tiny - now string has unravel and coins broken off after less than a month of wear.
2.0,The cuffs were huge and the tail was missing.
2.0,I knew this dress wouldn't be much but it is very cheap looking. Not to wear outside but maybe as a nightgown or pounding around the house in leggings. Polyester and cheaply made. You can buy these are most cheap discount stores in malls/flea markets.
2.0,"I bought these for my Fiance because they looked like they were similar to Muck Boots but a bit less expensive. Like they always say, you get what you pay for, but I anticipated paying $100 they would still be decent... they definitely aren't a muck boot, I'll leave it at that."
2.0,Disappointed att how tight they were with little to no strech. Great patterns
2.0,Not up to standard for a formal wedding.  Perhaps prom....
2.0,"After going to a very nice jeweler, they could only take out a few links. Watch is meant for large wrists."
2.0,Not crazy about the material. Trying to decide whether to keep it or not.
2.0,It's a nice shirt but the sleeves are so small that I can barely get my hands through them to put the shirt 9n
2.0,"I had it on my lanyard and it kept coming off, need to text out, otherwise not worth the money"
2.0,It's beautiful but the bracelets were to small for a young girls wrist. Now she does not to return but cannot wear. I am obligated to buy a bigger bracelet
2.0,"These are so uncomfortable! I sized up half a size since I have wide feet but they still didn’t work. I wore them to walk on the Vegas strip and by the end of the night, my feet were killing me! That was my first time wearing them and I wish I would’ve worn them before and maybe broke them in. They are very tight in the toe box"
2.0,"When you look through them, they have that brownish tint, rather than blue or even pink. Returning."
2.0,General product
2.0,Dont like the fabric and definitely runs a size smaller
2.0,I gave it to my granddaughter who is a size m.<br />The XXL was the size of a AMERICAN medium
2.0,"UPDATED REVIEW: Was So excited for these!  Had great reviews.  Was trying out this new brand. Super bummed when half the sole detached from one of the shoes within first month after just average household usage.  Delivered on June 13th and by July 13th, broken.  Sad :(<br /><br />Then, in response to my review, MIXIN blew me away and sent me not 1, not 2, but THREE new pairs!  Was so happy!  Super impressive customer responsiveness.  Unfortunately, by October two pairs had worn out already, both with the sole disconnecting from the slipper (on one slipper from within the pair).  So, As of Mid Oct, I'm down to my last pair...and likely gonna' have to go back to Dearfoam or whatever."
2.0,"good, traditional fit but the material was so stiff it was not a good feeling against my skin. had to return."
2.0,Not made of jersey material. More slick and shiny and a button missing toward the top.
2.0,"This hat is supposed to be a slouchy style where the top is long enough to slightly fold over to the side or the back. I had purchased one that was not lined and a different color and it fit beautifully. This hat seems to be made for children. It is very small. The top that is supposed to slouch over actually stands up straight so that I look like a conehead. Luckily, I have a small head so I can wear it to knock around the house and while working outside, but it is not attractive with such a small fit. The hat is warm and comfortable, though a little tight because it is sized too small. I would not purchase again because the product is not as advertised."
2.0,"Ordered 2, front clasp on 1 was broken. Easily returned. Bra does provide good support and I like that it is lined, but it doesn’t “breathe” well. I find that even just wearing it around the house I’m sweaty under the bra, which I’ve not had this I ssue with other brands. Also the zipper sometimes slips down a bit. I probably wouldn’t buy this again. But it was inexpensive so I guess I got what I paid for."
2.0,Es muy complicado de configurar me llago una pequeña hoja con letras chinas de un lado y de el otro en inglés son tan pequeñas y el dobles de la hoja a borrado parte de las indicaciones para configurarlo tengo tiempo que lo compre y ya está abandonado en un cajón 😒
2.0,Arms and shoulders are not forgiving.
2.0,Very itchy and awkward on my hand. I took it off after the first 30 minutes of the party.
2.0,So small you can barley read words Wasn’t worth the money
2.0,"I used this wallet for 2 weeks before 2 of the snaps popped off. It honestly wouldn't have been too big of a deal if it was just one of the male sides that broke, but it was a male and a female that decided they didn't want to be part of the fun anymore. had i of managed to find the pieces i might have been able to fix it and give it a 4 star rating, but that didn't happen. I gave it 2 stars because i still like the wallet, but I'm not willing to risk buying it again and have the snaps break again. Waiting on a refund currently."
2.0,"Great quality but the size is totally off. I ordered a size 10/12, XLarge. The size I received was more like a 6, 6X."
2.0,"There is way too much fabric in the front and not enough in the back. My butt crack is constantly hanging out: no they’re not backwards either!! Lol For me ordering a 3x is much bigger than I actually wear I wanted to make sure they’d fit, of course they didn’t"
2.0,"Did not like this dress, the fit was smaller then expected and there was too much material on the top."
2.0,"I tried both the medium and small size. I am 5’7, 150 lbs, athletic build and the medium was too big and baggy and the small was way to tight in the chest and awkward cut. Cute style and good quality, just didn’t fit quite right."
2.0,I liked everything about the product unfortunately it was for a person that was about 7 ft tall. I was looking for a medium.
2.0,Doesnt look like the picture
2.0,Normally I buy a size medium or a woman's size 8.  I am 5' 3&#34; and 135lbs. This dress was pretty but fit a bit too snug around the middle for my liking.  Also the waist line was too high for me.  I was looking forward to wearing it to a wedding and from the reviews I was confident that it would be a keeper.  Disappointed.  :(
2.0,"Loved the shirt. Wore it to my sister’s wedding. Washed it once and the seam came apart. Disappointed because I was planning on wearing it to a friend’s wedding today. Nice looks, poor quality!10"
2.0,Lost it’s sleeve shape within hours of wearing. I tried to pull up the arm and it fell each time. This snags easily. Low quality shirt. Considered a novelty purchase to wear for the day then I had to just toss it in the garbage. Not worth the money or aggravation.
2.0,"A couple weeks ago when I ordered this bag, it had different measurements, the whole width of the bag they said was 17.3 inches. I bought this for the soul purpose of travelling with my 15.6 inch laptop and it came much smaller than expected."
2.0,Not as good of quality I thought it would be.
2.0,"These are to short for casual hanging, unless you are only using the to secure the glasses they are not useful for hanging around your neck unless your neck is that of a child."
2.0,"This band has a nice soft and flexible feel to it.  I bought it because of the simple clasp using a straight in rivet like the original band that the Apple watch comes with.  The bad news is the band does not come off from the watch after it is inserted into the band clips, therefore making this NOT interchangeable. Like some of the other reviews say, the clip is stuck and you have to destroy the band by rib the rubber out of the tiny clip and then remove the clip with the assistance of a small tool like a eyeglass screw driver.  Your watch is intact, but you have destroyed this watch band in the process.  It is therefore just 1 use only.  It's nice for that one use."
2.0,Zipper on middle case broke
2.0,Gift! My favorite was the smile in my grandsons face
2.0,Meh...if you are busty then this dress will look like a maternity jumper.
2.0,"I thought these earrings were super cute when we received them. The size is also nice for a child, not too small or large. The complaint I have is that my daughter got these seven days ago and they are already tarnished. I put them in jewelry cleaner and it didn't help. My daughter was very disappointed because they were a birthday gift."
2.0,"Very small, very difficult to stretch out Isnd I wish the size are bigger.<br />Very good concept but not really worked that well"
2.0,The bar might be surgical steel but the metal on the back of the flower turned my skin green :/
2.0,"It looks chunky and heavy cardigan and nice colors too that why I ordered but when I received it, that was totally disappointed, it looks not detailed and baggy, it is not a good piece to keep that I didn’t even dry it on and straight to return."
2.0,All that shine and sparkle is not always all of that.  I had to Super Glue over 50% of the shoe charms back together.  Pretty and junky at same time…I do not recommend unless you have lots of super glue
2.0,Fit way too small around my thigh and butt area. Should be elastic there instead of non stretching. Beautiful design though. Just wasn’t for me. Returned it.
2.0,Literally took it off as soon as I got home. Wtf is this material even called? Stret-itch? Beautiful print though.
2.0,"I have ordered two of these (2 separate orders) and experienced the same issues with both. Usually I would cast these issues off as problems with shipping but it is evident that this is a product quality issue.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that the mold is absolutely amazing which makes me wish I was really able to get this to work but unfortunately due to too many flaws, it won't really work as a costume or display unit for me.<br /><br />The first one I received had minor chips in the paint which were in areas that weren't too visible so I would have been ok with it. The problems that I found unacceptable were that there was a crack in the paint on the front side of the mask just under the left eye lens and one of the eye lenses had an outward indent as if something had tried to push it out from the inside.<br /><br />The tail/rudder also looked like it was dirty but wouldn't clean off.<br /><br />I ordered a second unit so that I could compare and return the worse unit and it was nearly the same. I haven't even taken it out of the bag yet and already see a puncture/crack in the lens, various damages to the paint as well as another crack in the paint.<br /><br />Packaging seems good enough so the fact that the same issues happened twice make me think this is a quality control issue which is a shame because this product has so much potential."
2.0,The fabric quality left much to be desired
2.0,"These sandals are cute but I wear a wide shoe and ordered a wide sandal.  The straps on top have been made for a wide foot, I could get them on ok  but the manufacturerer needs to make the sole for a wide foot.  :(  My whole little toe hung over the side.  Very sad."
2.0,"I bought this for my husband for his Harley Davidson wallet.  He loved it.  Unfortunately, the metal is soft and after a few months it broke apart.  He was able to put the link back together, but it broke apart again and when he tried to fix it, the  metal just crumbled.  He is very disappointed.  This is not meant for everyday use so it's basically useless."
2.0,"Glasses look great, but extremely cheap quality. They were just sitting in the sunglass holder in my car overnight and the frame broke."
2.0,Wouldn't recommend this shirt.  It's just blah and the fabric feels gross while working out.
2.0,Very good size and seems good quality received with a terrible smell I haven't been able to remove
2.0,The shoes look great and feel of good quality but they where 3 sizes to small! And if that us there idea of wide I hate to see a normal shoe.  I didn't even bother trying them on because there was absolutely no way I would be able to begin to try ND squeeze my foot into that
2.0,Do not fit well and stain easily
2.0,Not fond of this set of pants. I was looking for something more loose-fitting.
2.0,Great glasses but the battery dies quick. Turn them on when the count down starts 10.9.8.7.6.5...
2.0,"I have had the band for a few months now. I love the look, but now unfortunately it's starting to turn my wrist green!"
2.0,I’m a big fan of Jack and this was reasonably priced but the band broke in about a month. Not worth it
2.0,"Looks pretty in the picture but it was too cheap looking to even consider wearing to the wedding that I was attending. I'll give it to my little nieces! I did wear the earrings, though. The necklace... no way!"
2.0,They are very cute. I ordered size 4 and they fit like a 2. Very disappointing
2.0,"Had these for 9 months and the matte coating first discolored to a greenish color and now is peeling off. Really liked the shape and size, and loved them when they first arrived, so this is disappointing"
2.0,They were cute and fit nicely but they are coming apart after one wear. Very disappointed because they are super cute.
2.0,This is cute but HUGE. It has so much fabric it feels a bit like I am wearing a trash bag on my head.
2.0,Not as nice as the picture make it look.
2.0,"One good thing is it looks just like the picture.  Bad thing is that it would not stay in place it needs two pins, one at the top and one at the bottom, only have pin at the top, how did you expect for it to say in place.  Now I have to figure out what to do with it."
2.0,I actually loved the top. The first one was too small in the mid area so I returned and got a large.  Drastically different in size. Thinking the medium was actually a small.  The jury is still out on this one.
2.0,"Here are my thoughts on the minimalist aluminum slim wallet....<br /><br />Pro: It will securely hold your credit cards. The rubber band is very tight so you don't have to worry that your cards will slip out.<br />Con: It is so tight, that it can be a bit difficult to get a particular card out.  Sure you can take a card out without problem, but when it is your turn at the register and you have to take out that particular card, it's not always that easy.<br />What I think I will do is keep the cards I don't use so frequently in it. But if I have to use this AND another one to hold my other cards...what is the point?<br /><br />Con: Although it says you can use it for money, I definitely do not recommend that. The band is so tight that my money ripped trying to get it out...unless you want to undo the whole thing to get out your money.  And if you are at a register, having to take it apart and then putting all the cards back in will result in dirty looks from the people in line behind you.<br />But if you use this for cards only and need something else to hold your cash....what is the point?<br /><br />Pro: RFID to protect your identity from being stolen.  However, there is no way for me to test this to see if it works.<br /><br />Pro: It is made out of aluminum so it is hard and durable.<br /><br />Pro: Slim, sleek design so it doesn't take up much room. Much smaller than a regular wallet.<br /><br />In summary, I really wanted to like this and in theory it would be great, but I just found that it is not helpful to me at all. Maybe if you don't carry cash and just have a few cards and your license, this would be work out for you. It says that it will hold up to 20 cards. However, I found that 7 cards is about as much as you could really put in so you are able to take them out.  I put in 9 and it was very difficult to take out one particular card you are looking for. It is easier to take out the ones on the ends..those would be no problem at all. Finding a particular card in the middle of the stack is the challenging part.<br /><br />I was able to get this for free in exchange for my honest review. As you can see, I am always truthful in my reviews and getting a discount does not influence my decision. I rely on reviews when I make purchases, too. If you found my review helpful, I would appreciate it if you would click yes that it was helpful to you."
2.0,"The fit of this item is exactly as expected. It’s tunic length as expected- falls to bottom of crotch, long enough to wear with leggings.<br />Material is a polyester blend as expected. But the finish on this fabric is not jut silky, it’s literally shiny. I was not expecting the material to be so slick ... appears a very cheap product, not a fashion statement at all. More like grandma’s failed attempt to be fashion forward. Also the material will not breathe , so I worry about overheating, sweating, and odor. Returned."
2.0,The back part of it is too long and pokes my ear too much
2.0,Material was weird and sizing wasn't accurate
2.0,"Still happy I got this as I like the print and the cut, that it hits at the hips. However it is not thick like a sweatshirt, it’s really just a long sleeve T-shirt."
2.0,This item did nt cost very much and I could see why when i received it. The bracelet band felt tinny and un-durable. The hands on the face had a lot of give in them when I attempted to set the watch. I really wanted to keep it because I didn't pay much for it but I felt that the 16.00 bucks could be better spent on something else.
2.0,"I was disappointed that these are made so cheap!  They are made of tinny button type! Not worth the money, nor do I want to give them to my grand daughters!"
2.0,I placed the turbans in the wash on gentle cycle before even trying them on. Unfortunately one (1) fell apart before I had the opportunity to wear it.
2.0,This dress is way too short! I can't wear it and dont feel comfortable bending over.
2.0,Beautiful image and vibrant tee shirt but it runs a whole size small and Has limited sizes.  So technically they only carry them up to an XL
2.0,I bought this for my Halloween costume. They are very thin and roll down a lot at the top. Thankfully I had double sided fabric tape that saved the day. Other than that the shoes I wore with them rubbed the color/pattern off by the end of the night around the ankles. So they are decent for a one time use. Glad it came with 2 pairs.
2.0,"This item’s fit was far larger than any xl I’ve ever seen. You can return items, but it’ll cost you a chunk of change..."
2.0,"Please do your job right and inspect the items before you send to your customers.  We pay for them, it is not like you are giving them away for free.  The stone has a hole, it might not be a big deal for some but for me it does not work. I bought it to wear but it looks like it will be going into the trash."
2.0,"I liked the idea,  my coin is 2""wide,  read that it could fit 2.75"" maybe I misread it.  Buy my coin wouldn't fit in it. So it isn't usable for me"
2.0,"Really cute but they got worn away (threadbare) on the heel and footbed from wearing them around the house by the second day. Also, the toe seam was pointy and rubbed my toes annoyingly. If you only want them for pics and don’t mind getting one use out of them then you’ll be fine."
2.0,Sack of potatoes
2.0,Came detached & wayyyy too small.
2.0,had to order a size larger than usual to fit in the bust area - 2nd order was defective. cheaply made dress
2.0,Bought these for a Christmas gift and 3 of the 6 came broke!!!
2.0,Not as stretchy as I thought it would be other wise great material
2.0,Very thin<br />Quality seems a bit cheap
2.0,Got scratched so easy
2.0,"I love the tightest of the stomach area. Totally held in my momma pouch. I ordered a small, the bottom half was maybe a bit tighter than a small. But the top half was huge! And flappy. So if you have a small waist and big breasts, this could be a cute swimsuit. I returned it."
2.0,Recommend hand wash. Washing machine stresses stitches
2.0,"It is difficult for me to judge this bra because the sizing is way off.<br />Basically, as soon as I pulled it out of the bag it came in, I thought it looked to small.<br />Trying it on I could tell the cups in particular were not properly sized.<br />Then, to drive the point home, I compared it to my other 38C bras, which further confirmed the garment's actual size does not match its tag size.<br /><br />I would estimate the cup is actually a B.<br />Measuring the full length of the unfastened bra from end to end, it is 29.5 inches, at most.<br /><br />Quality wise, I am not overly impressed with this bra.<br />While it is not the worst bra I've ever seen in terms of material and construction, it is also not the best.<br />At the same time, for the price point it might be a decent back up bra, save for the fact that you would need to order several sizes up if you wanted to have any hope of getting one that fit.<br /><br />Since it is affordable, this might be an OK bra to have, but you would have to select one at least one cup and several sizes up from your normal bra size, then cross your fingers that you guessed right.<br />In the end, I would like to see the makers of this bra check their sizing measurements in order to more closely align the tag size and physical size."
2.0,"Don't let the product description fool you. These are just slip-ons with a small tab at the heel. They fall off as easily as slip-ons. If you want to do more than shuffle around indoors, these slippers won't cut it."
2.0,"The hat was very nice, but they messed up on one of the prints. I wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Only lasted a few days.
2.0,Honestly I would NOT recommend these shoes. The only reason I gave 2 stars is for the cute factor. Otherwise they fell apart within a week.
2.0,"The band does not withstand much and tore in 10 days. It is also not even a tiny bit water resistant there was fog in the watch after washing my hands. If all you want is a beautiful watch and you don't plan on moving or doing anything, then this is the watch for you. I can't even return it because my dog got ahold of the box."
2.0,"Poorly made, poor quality. There was a tear at the seam on three out of the six pants we bought."
2.0,I liked the style .  The for was good . It wasn't what I expected .
2.0,I bought the Dusty Blue. XXL as suggested. I think a XL would’ve fit a lot better. I love the color and the fit is ok. But holding the dress in light you can see through both layers (front and back layers). I would make sure you have a full length slip with a bra.
2.0,way to small for being and adult 12-14
2.0,This dress looks cheap. It also has a weird space under the arms
2.0,The leather has a plastic type film over it that makes it very stiff.  I tried breaking it in but it never softened.  Would not buy it again.
2.0,This is a good fit - but it fits more of an athletic fit than compression. I would go a size down if I wanted compression- alas there is no extra small. So small will have to do.<br /><br />I have an addiction to the Spiderman compression shirts. So I ordered this one as it mimics the advanced armor suit in the ps5 game.<br /><br />The images on amazon is better looking than the actual product itself. I think the photos of the product is a computer mock up so the colors are crisp but the actual shirt the printing is not as crisp. I have close up shots and far photos.  It looks pretty ok from afar like a monet bit looks fairly mediocre up close.<br /><br />It ultimately looks like an illustrated shirt and the printing is not tight.  I may send it back and wait for 2nd generation- not quite worth the $20 dollars - should be like $12–$15 due to the sloppy print.<br /><br />I think I might send it back.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this. It could have been very cute, but has some serious design flaws. I am 5 feet tall and the sleeves were way too short. It’s also more of a crop style so needs to be worn with high waisted pants. I would have kept it if the sleeves had been longer."
2.0,The fabric is weird. The cut is small and it is just not flattering
2.0,"Great idea, if the sizes were accurate..Ordered a large and it might as well been an Extra Small..<br />Be advised, the material is shiny.."
2.0,Received the wrong color.
2.0,"I believe this night vision aspect is somewhat overrated.  Also, if I had to repurchase, I would select the regular glasses to fit over my vision glasses and not this clip type."
2.0,Sleeve holes are huge
2.0,The stem on the belt buckle barely reaches the edge so it pups out and under the buckle so it doesn’t hold watch on very well. You have to be extremely careful trying to buckle. It is rather disappointing.
2.0,The fabric used is coarse and heavy . Makes it look cheap
2.0,I ordered two of these bottoms and can't say I'm super happy with either- however one is definitely better than the other. I bought one black bottom through Amazon prime which I returned as soon as I bought it. Their seam holding the bottoms together goes right down the front of it giving you the look of having the worlds worst camel toe. I also bought an orange pair that came from China without prime and took longer to arrive but this is the one I am &#34;happier&#34; with. There is no awful front seam however I think the ruching in the back is a little extensive as once they are worn it goes across the whole backside and I prefer just slight ruching.
2.0,I definitely wasn’t impressed by these. I could have bought a better pair for the same price
2.0,"Pretty cheap looking for the price, smelled funny coming out of the box. For the price, you could get something better elsewhere"
2.0,"The design was cute but, the shirt was not soft or comfortable."
2.0,"I think it’s very cute but it runs big. I wear a 6 and got the size accordingly but it was very big on me, all over. Sadly, I had to return it."
2.0,Pretty but beads faded after 2weeks
2.0,Not f long enough order long or Tall don't seem like there's much difference in long or regular
2.0,"Runs super, super small! Ordered my usual size 14 and I cannot come close to zipping it up! It may as well be a size 8 because there’s a good 8 inch gap on my back 😿"
2.0,Earrings were a lot bigger than expected. I won't be wearing them because they are a bit heavier than I like earrings to be and they were bigger than I expected.
2.0,"I really like this bag HOWEVER, the lining is made from some type of material that is SO LOUD. When I simply pick the bag up off the counter it sounds as though I am ruffling through plastic grocery bags filled with loose aluminum foil. When I open the bag and softly slide my hand in to grab something, it sounds like I’ve opened the loudest bag of Doritos in the world. What in the world??? It’s embarrassing. I really need this bag for a trip in 5 days, but I also don’t want the entire country to look at me because I sound like a present being unwrapped on Christmas every time I walk. Who on earth OKed cat toy noise making material to be used??"
2.0,"Loved the color on me. Too long: I am 5’ 1”. If the white material also had some stretch, the fit would be better. I need to return"
2.0,ichy
2.0,This is pretty but it did not fit right on me at all. I am short and curvy. I was swimming in this.
2.0,"Love the pattern and color however the design was awkward.  Waist was too high on me and then hip area looked odd.  Fabric, as described by others, likely would stick to you in humid weather.  Sent it back."
2.0,"I will start this by saying they look really well made...but they are way way small and the selection said red, but in no way is that strip red! It's pink(which is ok because we have a girl) but still was misleading. This picture is of her size 4 play shoes next to the 4-5.5 water shoes... really disappointed in how off the sizing was."
2.0,"I have owned 3 different pairs of Columbia sandals prior to this one, and I always considered myself pleased with their products.  However, this style is significantly less comfortable than the other Columbia sandals I owned.  The footbeds are significantly less padded, and provide little support or cushioning.  When I received them, they were also covered in small plastic bumps similar to those left over when a plastic is molded and connected to a holding strip.  These bumps (about the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen) dug uncomfortably into my sole and I finally had to remove them manually with a razor blade in order to make the sandals wearable.  The stitching is also sloppy in several places and I expect it will come unraveled without too much stress.  Overall a disappointment from someone who expected better from Columbia."
2.0,"It's a very cute Peace sign... large in size but, it broke almost immediately after my daughter put it on. I would recommend a better chain."
2.0,"Not as dark as the picture and the keychain is flat, I was expecting it to be 3 dimensional."
2.0,"I was disappointed in the design of this tie case. You have to fold the ties to fit them in, which makes them quite thick. The case is barely a half inch thick at full capacity, so two ties is a very tight fit. Even with one tie, the mesh puches leave an imprint in your tie due to the tight fit. With two ties the case bulges slightly. Disappointing as the build quality was actually adequate. Makes you wonder if the manufacturer even tested the product..."
2.0,Very tiny and difficult to put in due to supersmall parts.
2.0,"What I did not like about this sock is, it’s is very hard to get on and off."
2.0,Medium was way too big.
2.0,I had to return this top.  I should have ordered up at least two sizes.
2.0,I love these leggings and I DID order the appropriate size BUT  when I received the product they were way too long IN the legs and I had to pull them up nearly to my chest. I do wear an extra large but this was put together wrong. The tag even said X-Large.
2.0,Nice length. Looks sharp. Feels icky. And is too wide.
2.0,its really cool but the zippers are plastic so after a while they brake and cant shut
2.0,They sat far off of nose.  A lot of space between glasses and my face.
2.0,Looks great but very orange. And th material<br />Don’t like
2.0,"I really wanted to like the jacket, however, it wasn't meant to be. I ordered a medium. First, it arrived without a box even though it said new. Second, the jacket was oversized by a lot, third, very cheaply made for an orolay goose down. Very thin, and definitely lacking comfort. Now that I know, maybe it's time to change brands. Btw it's not my first orolay"
2.0,"This is a very nicely made quality vest. However, it is really not a true concealed carry vest. Sure the pocket is large enough to place a small handgun but there is nothing that will keep it in place.<br /><br />I have bought in the past a true concealed carry vest that has sewn in straps that hold a weapon and extra magazines. Unfortunately this vest does not. Had to return it."
2.0,Painful to wear
2.0,Received Saturday. Wore briefly Sunday and to school Monday and Tuesday.
2.0,"If you expect a “leather look” cuff, don’t buy this. Very poor quality"
2.0,Too short to fit. Most were bent.
2.0,Literally broke the second day I wore it.
2.0,Cute and I was happy with it until today. Was having lunch in a restaurant with my hubby. We placed it on the seat of a chair to place it out of the way. He picked it up for me as we were leaving and the top of it almost cam completely off. It was only the third time I had worn it.
2.0,"Most likely I just didn't read the specs carefully, but these earrings are HUGE and very heavy. I has trying to go for something a little more subtle, but they almost touch my shoulders. There is only detail on the front so they look super strange from the back."
2.0,Grommets tore out in a matter of weeks
2.0,The sleeves rolled up all night. Couldn’t get the back flap to lay flat. I ordered a large as i would any top but might’ve gone for a 2x with this style if i had had more time to return it (halloween costume)
2.0,The filter covers my mouth instead of my nose making this mask ineffective and essentially dangerous to wear in public
2.0,"Good value, but had to send them back."
2.0,"I bought a small I’m 5’8 125 lbs looks good very form fitting and flattering yet comfortable. It is a bit thin, it’s a cotton dress and a light color so I can’t really knock the product on that one. It would be the same situation if it were a T-shirt from a high end store, it just is what it is.  so be carful with the Beige one you will need a slip."
2.0,Does not look like photo. Thin. Not 3D appearance.
2.0,Does not stay on the nose bridge well; the near sighted vocals are too close to each other; you have to almost cross your eyes to read through them.
2.0,Didn't care for the fabric nor the design.
2.0,Fits as expected but the material started to break down on the first use. I purchased 3 pairs (3 kids) and all 3 had the same issue. They are cute and fit well but i wouldnt expect them to last a full summer at the pool. Beach maybe but not on concrete/cool decking.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. It looks great on the model and I hoped it would be flattering on me. But it's just.... Weird. The arms are big. Like not bell sleeve big, like HUGE. If you pull it up to be empire waist then your butt and vagina fall out. If you pull it down to cover your bits then the seams are at the top and bottom of your stomach. The top has absolutely no stretch to it and if you have a muscular build or are thick it feels like you can ""hulk"" out. I'm 5'4"", 159lbs and ordered a medium."
2.0,The ring is beautiful and my husband loved it. The only problem is that the Oval part kept coming out.
2.0,"The top section is the grey part- grey/ cream/tan-it is not mint green looking like the picture. I should have read the reviews. Material is very loosely knit, but it's super comfy. Might return due to color."
2.0,Material uncomfortable around wire and only wore twice before it popped...🤯😫🤦🏼‍♀️
2.0,Very thin and slides. Doesn’t stay put when my hair is clean.<br />Not my fav type to workout in. I have curly hair and my baby hairs stick out after cardio.<br />Definitely not a yoga type headband but you make anything work in a pinch.
2.0,"It's cute but smaller than expected. Definitely need another shirt under. Color was off, not a pretty dark blue like I thought. Looks washed out."
2.0,Already pilled when I got them out of the bag. Which was a shame because they fit like I wanted.
2.0,"i lived this and wore it everyday! after a few months, it turns out that neptune is mot a crystal, but a painted plastic bead.."
2.0,Horrible smell that takes many washes to remove
2.0,I am female & it barely fit my head!
2.0,"The skirt in this outfit is so cute and fits adorably. Which made me really sad about the rest of the cosplay.  The shirt doesn't button over large breast (I am 5'8"", 200 lbs with 38 DDD bra size) Both the shirt and the vest are so see through which is not like the anime. The vest fits but is so see through and you can see each button of the shirt and the lines. From afar it wouldn't look bad but anyone standing by you or pictures could see through it. Even my bra was visible."
2.0,I bought this skirt in red and it looks really different than the lovely picture on the website.  Really poofy around the waist--not at all flattering!  Sent it back.
2.0,This watch looks cool and all but the metal is pretty cheap and water is its nemesis.
2.0,low-quality. Broke like a month after purchasing.
2.0,"Unfortunately I purchased this for my Moto360 Gen. I realize afterwards that I have a $350 watch, that I'm going to showcase on a $15 vinyl pleather band.<br />For wearing your watch while barbecuing or having a beer with friends, the band will do. If you are in high school or college and on a budget, again it will serve you just fine.<br />For wearing your watch while actually trying to dress up, or are a business professional looking to wear your smartwatch to the office every day then this band looks way to cheap and I would recommend buying something nicer.<br /><br />I was expecting something on par with the band that came with the watch, this was definitely not it. I ended up going on Etsy and ordered an actual leather 22mm band. They have a lot to offer in the $30-50 range. As you get closer to the $50 mark I noticed sellers offering custom stitching color, initial imprints etc.<br /><br />Putting this band on your smartwatch is like getting a Cadillac and putting it on black steel wheels (the kind that take hubcaps). You want your Cadi to look nice buy some nice rims for it."
2.0,"I thought these would look more blue, but they only look like this from a specific angle under the right lighting, like this photo. Expect a very white opal look 99.9% of the time. Also they were a size or two too small."
2.0,"I have multiple pairs of Frye, and these just didn’t do it for me. My heel slipped, and I felt like they rubbed weird in front and on the side. They also made my feet look huge! I had tried on two different pairs at the same time, one on each foot, and these made my feet look like I wore a size 9, not the 7.5 I actually wear.<br /><br />Also, people keep saying Frye doesn’t use rubber soles, but they do on some styles. All of my boots have been in a white box, and  the logo is also on the box...the black box is different, but not sure that means they are fakes...especially since these are sold by 6pm. 6pm and Zappos are both Amazon companies and I have always received authentic products from both of them."
2.0,"poor quality. the ear piece fell off after only 2 months,"
2.0,"Larger than expected and the plastic clap looks really cheep. Strong chemical smell, so I returned it. Two stars because of the price only."
2.0,"I buy a LOT of Ekouaer, especially for loungewear.<br />I'm a small who buys mediums to give myself room. This generally isn't an issue for my chest, but this medium top has NO give at all and pulls across my boobs. The material has no stretch whatsoever, and it's just not the soft, comfy material I'm used to from Ekouaer.<br />The pants fit fine, but the top made this set a NO for me.<br />Even if the top DID fit, I would probably be returning because the material.<br />I do know that different colors are often made from different materials, but this was the black set. It's just not that soft modal fabric you get accustomed to from this brand.<br />For reference, I'm just under 5'2"" and about 115 pounds. I think if I wore a size B or A bra, this would not have been a problem, but I'm a little bit larger, so maybe that's why. It just doesn't feel like THIS top is sized to go with THESE pants."
2.0,They do not look anything like the photos. They do not taper towards the bottom and the waist is too tight. I bought sizes larger just to be sure and was barely my waist size. Cheap material. Unless you need crap pants don't buy em.
2.0,I'm not the right shape for this dress. I have an athletic build. And this was absolutely ridiculous on me.
2.0,The shirts fits to size but the material is a cheap mesh. I thought it was either a cotton or dry fit material but it’s not. It’s like a cheap old school after market football or basketball jersey
2.0,The silver rings looked like those you would get out of bubble gum machine. One of them had openings where at one angle it looked like stones and at other angles it looked as if stone was missing. I had to return.
2.0,"Gorgeous bands, however, the clasp on the milanese band has sharp corners and a weak magnet."
2.0,I bought for my husbands birthday and it’s so small that the first wash would turn it into a small.
2.0,"The front is supportive, but my butt totally gobbles up the back.  I guess it could be my butt?<br /><br />Also, go two sizes up.  If you're a small, get a large."
2.0,Fit perfect for my 7 year old but has a bad chemically smell
2.0,Love the color and washed out black look but unfortunately it arrived with a gasoline/kerosene smell despite repeated washing and hanging outside - still smells yuck :(
2.0,Necklace is way to small to see
2.0,"This was bought for a very slim five-yr old girl who wears size 5 clothing. It JUST fits. It would not fit a particularly thick child at all. As far as using it for a headwrap, it is very wide. The only positive that I can really say is that it has gorgeous colors.<br />Very disappointed in this purchase."
2.0,Glasses feel and look cheap! =(<br /> Not what I was hoping for. Contemplating on whether or not to return it.
2.0,This bracelet would've been perfect except there was a misspelled word on one of the charms. Fix this and then good to go! Comes in cute box and sturdy quality.
2.0,Way smaller than described. Made my big toes numb and filmy toes felt confined and hurt a bit. I sent them back for a refund and stuck to my footie socks from Finish Line.
2.0,Went with the size that my daughters foot was and they came in and were a little to big for her. They kept coming off when she would do a turn.
2.0,"These are smaller than described in the product listing.  I bought another pair of clip-ons at the same time, and the other pair fits as it should.  These are worthless, since too small.  They only cover about two-thirds of my lenses."
2.0,I measured my chest and back size as suggested. My measurements suggested a large. It came in and was nowhere a large. In comparing it with other vests I have it is definitely smaller. I liked how the vest looked and the exterior nylon shell but I am returning it.
2.0,These felt scratchy and not great quality for the price - we returned.
2.0,"I really like the wallet design, but I ordered the Crazy Horse Khaki, and it came in more like very lite tan. Not crazy about the color at all. It fits in my front pocket perfectly."
2.0,"The print is not as nice as the pic, the arm holes are large and the fabric is abrasive"
2.0,"SADLY RUNS VERY SMALL - I reeeeeally love the feel of the fabric, very soft, has great stretch. And the color is such a pretty gray. But the sizing is way off. I am 5'8, 150 lbs. I normally wear a medium to large, but for my workout tanks I order Larges or XLs, so they fit looser. The look of the shirt in the photo seemed like it was more of a boxy fit. It suctioned to my body. I am far from being an XL, it looked more like an XS. I am glad I didn't pay much for this tank. But really bummed I won't be able to have it fit me to wear to the gym."
2.0,Would of been a nice dress if it was not made so poorly.Arrived missing the stones.very disappointed .
2.0,These were very cheap and did not fit my daughters feet well.
2.0,It's not as long as it appears on line
2.0,"Way too small. I am 5’3 and an average size 12. These barely fit over my bum and definitely did not meet my waist. Other than that, they are a beautiful pair of leggings."
2.0,"I’m a 30-31 inch waist depending on the time of the month. I ordered these in an extra large and although they fit in the waist, the crotch area is just weird fitting. Can’t explain it. Don’t recommend."
2.0,Wife liked the look. The length of it was way to short. Would recommend for shorter person. Bought XL for 5' 8&#34; woman.<br />Would better fit a 5' 2&#34; woman.
2.0,"I usually wear a large, sometimes x-large in women’s clothes, so I got this shirt in a large.  It fits okay, but I feel like the bottom part is looser than it needs to be.  The cut of this shirt did not work with my body shape at all.  I wear a bra size 42D, so I’m a bit busty.  The seam between the solid part and the floral part goes across the middle of my chest, which looks and feels a bit weird.  Because of my bustiness and this design, it makes me look much bigger in my stomach area than I actually am.  I tried wearing it but just didn’t like how it looked on me, so I ended up changing.<br /><br />2 stars = I don’t like it."
2.0,"Buttons don’t keep top fastened. The top fits fine, not too small, but the buttons must be too small for the wholes because they just come a loose foe no reason."
2.0,"Lasted about 6 weeks before the upper parts split from the soles. Otherwise, cute shoes."
2.0,"If you order this outfit, you may want to order 3x larger than normal.  My son is an average 9-year-old.  I ordered 9-10 years for the size.  I was shocked by how snug the outfit was.  The shirt is skin tight, as are the pants.  The pants also look weird.  I expected them to be loose-fitting, like basketball shorts.  Instead they're long and tight, almost like spandex.  I would have sent this outfit back but my son loved it, regardless of the fact it was much too small."
2.0,"I like that they're flat; however, I broke 2 laces within weeks.  The breakage has led me to believe quality is a bit compromised.  I wouldn't buy again, as a broken shoe lace in the wrong setting (ie, business) is far from ideal."
2.0,Size is bigger than expected
2.0,"These aren’t my favorite. They flop around and it’s hard to grasp things when you have small hands. It’s a risky game anytime I am washing anything glass. Even if you’re feeling desperate because the psycho hoarders from your grocery store keep buying up the latex dishwashing gloves you usually use, don’t resort to this product. I will not be repurchasing."
2.0,"The clasp broke after the first day and the battery not long after. Very cute, but not functional."
2.0,"The color is great, but this color specifically is much smaller. I ordered the same dress in blue, and the blue was true to size. For whatever reason, the Burgundy fits MUCH smaller. Afraid to wash it and cause shrinking."
2.0,Cute but not able to use phone through clear side (touchscreen) so I’m sending it back.
2.0,"Not a snug fit, there is a lot of play when connected. Maybe i got a bad band, however, this is not it."
2.0,These are absolutely not men's gloves. They are women's gloves. They are like spandex with fur. I gave them to my mother. 2 stars because she said they were pretty.
2.0,"While the feather charm is at least detachable for use on other rings, this ring is simply WAY too small for any of my piercings, including my nostril piercing, which is so disappointing as it looks so very cute. =&#60;"
2.0,The description states you will receive 12 SETS of the photo. Which shows 12 pieces. You receive 1 SET of the photo. 12 pieces.
2.0,Once I get that piece I’ll be sure to let you know.
2.0,the material of very bad quality. I did not like this moldy
2.0,"Cute, but a decorative side strap broke after only a month."
2.0,I purchased it thinking this will stay in place exactly how I wrapped it. No matter if I tighten or loosen the belt it still rolls up.
2.0,"These are NOT waterproof. Every time my child comes in from playing in the snow, his hands are soaking wet and red."
2.0,"Look ok, but a couple are too short and don't work great."
2.0,"run real small just about cover up, nice material, would be really nice if sizing chart was close!!!"
2.0,Material feels cheap. Returned.
2.0,"The ring is very pretty. BUT (1) it took a very long time to receive. I did not realize it would be shipping from China. (2) The ring is HUGE. I ordered a size 6. The ring I received is much bigger and does not fit any of my fingers. (3) To return, I was told I’d have to pay for postage. Considering it shipped from China, I didn’t bother. The cost would likely be more than I paid for the ring. The seller did response to my message quickly though. I was offered a 30% discount. I’m not sure I’ll bother using it. If the next one I receive is the wrong size, it will just be more money and time wasted. It’s a shame because the ring is very nice."
2.0,Not a good purchase and waste of money
2.0,"Went thru 2 pairs within a month. feel great when on, rubber grips peeled immediately and in 2 weeks the seams ripped apart. They sent me another pair and exact same thing happened"
2.0,Love the graphics. The hat itself does not fit an adult's head.  Wish it were bigger and the fleece lined portion came down to the ears.  Saw other reviews that included similar comments but thought this order may be different.
2.0,These are good quality however they are in no way &#34;large&#34;.  That is the reason for the two stars. These are roughly half the size of a standard paper grocery bag - for those who remember paper bags.
2.0,the top cream part is see-through.
2.0,Too large and very short only about 30'' long.
2.0,I am usually a big fan of quay glasses but these were just very poorly made and were huge. The style is very cute but just not wearable.
2.0,Fits on the gear fit 2 perfectly and it fits on my wrist with plenty of room but I've had the buckle part fall off twice (extremely easy to pop back on) and the pattern is mostly rubbed off with normal daily use.
2.0,Not a fan of this shirt. It is low quality and I'll be returning it.
2.0,Very cheap item... looks like something from the dollar store.
2.0,"Not great, no elasticity. I could hardly get them over my thighs and my legs aren't even thick. Don't recommend."
2.0,"The romper fired great, but after the first was the lace just started to fall apart. Highly sad about that."
2.0,Note pads fell apart as soon as I pulled them out of the packaging.
2.0,Didn’t fit like similar products in the same sizes.  I’m sure some kids may like them but we didnt
2.0,I like the shirt on the model but when you put it on yourself it’s really loose not quite sure how to wear it
2.0,"Like another reviewer, I am disappointed with how tight these are. I've tried stretching them out with no luck. They are good for the purpose but uncomfortable and I have small feet. can't imagine how tight they are on someone with large feet!  I've washed them twice now and the elastic is already starting to come out."
2.0,low quality watch. I would not recommend to buy it. Arrows have been broken after 2 weeks.
2.0,I’m a size 2 to 4 so ordered a small.  Definitely too tight. Please go up a size!
2.0,"Small, flimsy fabric."
2.0,the color is not nearly as nice as the watch color it is more of a stark/biting rose gold instead of an elegant rose gold of the watch and as others have mentioned the bezel is now about impossible to move. I can see it being protective of the metal but at what cost to functionality?
2.0,"For an adult, I do not have a large head and have problems getting hats to fit. This hat was too small for even me.  Cute and would be warm, but fit is tight and not at all baggy as appears in photo.  Disappointed. Returned."
2.0,could not wear.
2.0,"The leggings themselves are fine, they are super soft and stretchy. However, the way they arrived is what has me disappointed. I ordered the three small to medium sizes, but when it arrived I had two small to medium sizes and one large to XL size. Fine. Then when I went to go try a pair on, they were DIRTY. Right out of the package! It looks like insulation fuzz, it was all over the inside of one of my leggings. In the picture, you can see the remainder of the debris, when I turned it inside out much of it fell off. How do these things happen? If you’re going resell used or returned leggings, at least make it known to customers and have it discounted."
2.0,I have a few items in my wardrobe made from the same thin very-clingy strecth t-shirt knit. They wrinkle very badly and show every single bump underneath. Just not flattering or convenient compared to a less clingy material.
2.0,"The top is cheap feeling and fits kind of small. I got a size 2 toddler and it fits my child tightly, though my child is small for 2 years old. The pants pill easily. Overall, looks and feels cheap and would not purchase again."
2.0,Really cheap material. The fit is off and the design is not flattering. I ended up returning it. The colors were nice together but the fabric and fit were not happening. I really wanted to like this dress but it's more like a cheap costume of sorts.
2.0,I kept meaning to return this item but failed to get it back.  I opened this item and it was VERY short- not long as pictured at all.
2.0,"Keep your hands work but, touch screen function works 1/20 times maybe?"
2.0,"Cute and a great fit (Small, I'm 5'4&#34;, 125 lb and pear shaped) but the light color was see through."
2.0,So disappointed. The quality received doesn’t match the photos or description. Looks like one of those flea market rings. But you get what you pay for
2.0,"This hat is so cute! The shape and fit is amazing! However, it STINKS like mold and mildew. I finally placed it in a plastic bag and threw it in the trash. It was stinking up my house."
2.0,"One of the plugs we're torn, so day by day, it kept tearing more, until it finally ripped in half. Maybe mine was a defect, and maybe all the others are great, but not a good experience on my end."
2.0,Tip broke off and I can't even find the broken piece.
2.0,not made well.  No grip. hard to walk in.
2.0,"Not what I expected, too big and too long, different pattern than shown on site"
2.0,Very Tight hardly any stretching in them at all. They start to hurt your wrist after awhile
2.0,It is a bit snug fitting.  I was hoping it would’ve been more comfortable to wear.
2.0,The fit was just fine but the color was not what I expected I am returning.
2.0,To saggy on the back
2.0,Plastic like and tight.
2.0,couldnt fit runs too small
2.0,"The pants are very cool, but the size Medium does not fit a 34” waist. I would recommend goin with a Large instead. The leather is very soft and I ripped one of the belt loops pulling them up. I’m not sure if I should return them or not as it took a very long time to ship them from Pakistan. Will not buy leather pants on Amazon again. ✌🏻These pants really smell of the chemicals they used for tanning them.. 🤢"
2.0,These did not fit well. They break/tear very easily as you're putting them on and then they are very loose and open around the wrist while being snug on the actual hand.
2.0,These didn’t not work for me. They were a little to small. They didn’t stay on. Very disappointed
2.0,I have bought many 100% cotton and this is not!! Very disappointed.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:2240070918cb4e9b6a195b6cbc9cfc46]] I have a perfectly normal size 12-12.5 foot. I always buy a size up, so I bought a size 13. It was STILL too small to fit my foot, and the plastic clip broke almost immediately. Even if it had held, there was a thoroughly insufficient amount of Velcro left to hold the shoe closed. The sole construction looks weak, but the straps didn’t last long enough to test that. If I had had a chance to try these on in a physical store, or even to take a good look at the, I would never have bought them. Cheap, shoddy shoes. 2 stars instead of one because delivery was prompt and they were well packaged. So, yay Amazon, Boo shoe manufacturer."
2.0,Very low quality socks. They ripped the very first time I wore them.
2.0,"The delivery and purchase experience was great (easy & fast!), but the product leaves MUCH to be desired. It’s not the deep blue pictured on the site, this is definitely navy. And even though I went with my hip and bust measurements, but it’s HUGE!<br />The material was much more thin than I’d anticipated, more t-shirt material. It’s very comfortable, and if it had been anywhere close to fitting, I may have kept it. The measurements & color were so far off I’m just going to return and not waste time attempting an exchange."
2.0,It was comfortable to wear but the color faded in places after being worn in the sun a few times.
2.0,The picture shows all part of the boots covered.<br />I received a cheaply made product that cost like two silver leggings.<br />When put the cover on my boots I look more like an astronaut and it doesn't cover the heels.<br />I will follow up with the picture of what I received.<br />Expensive!
2.0,There's no elasticity in these so they slip and slide all over your head.
2.0,They slip around even though they never fall off.  I kept them because they looked good and felt like they fit.  But then I walked around in them for a day and they move around and don't fit so perfectly.
2.0,"I purchased these for my sister, she wears a larger size sock.  I bought the 4X - 5X, the largest size they sell and they normally would fit, but these are running Way Too Small!  I will have to return and find her a more comfortable compression sock."
2.0,"I like the choker ancient look necklace, got alot of compliments,when I wear it."
2.0,"The claim for these Yoga Leggings is not true. I wouldn't recommend the purchase of them, unless you're a petite size 10 and purchase the PLUS SIZE 12-22."
2.0,"I love this brand b/c their dresses are so fun and cute. I love dresses that are unique and different. This dress, unfortunately was not figure flattering. I usually wear a Large (loss some weight) but wear 38C. It fit in the chest but the rest was really baggy and the part where the stripes started just didn't look right. Maybe if you had a smaller chest, it may look better. But I just looked frumpy in it. Returned it for that reason."
2.0,Tamaño demasiado grande a lo esperado..
2.0,Good quality frame and lenses. Problem is the nose bridge will block your view when looking to your driver side mirror. The black bridge and brow is also distracting.
2.0,The color and fabric of this dress is nice.  The dress fits nothing like the person in the photo.  I did do the measurements to get the correct size.  This dress requires a lot of altering to make it fit correctly.  I was disappointed.
2.0,This is not what you think it is.... it’s a string with this plastic looking anchor (carbon fiber....). And i guess you have to try to loop it around your wrist and make it look like something. Laughable.  Maybe a $2 product. But $30?  Sheesh.....
2.0,the color and size were good- but the feel of the fabric I couldn't stand. returned :(
2.0,looks cheap.  Also the design around the bottom stone has little tiny fake diamonds.  I thought it was just silver so it looks really cheap.
2.0,The lenses are very hard to install and they're not good quality. You can see your eyeballs through the lens
2.0,"The size that I truly looked and worked hard on not making a mistake, these ended up being too large so my son is not able to wear them just yet which really stinks because they were part of a christmas gift.  I really thought I looked at these really good and that they were to be the right size and too big. My son's shoe size is size 12 so I guess I must be missing something here unless of course because the sock runs for shoe size 10.5 to 4 they are just too big for a shoe size 12 but then why say it would fit?  Nonetheless, we are just holding onto these socks for now."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this suit! It’s a great color (army green) and is good quality material for the price. However, I’m 5’9, and the suit was at least 6-8 inches too short. The cups came to the middle of my abdomen. If you’re tall or have a long torso, don’t purchase."
2.0,"It holds together but seems to be slowly falling apart. For the first month, the band was great. After that, it is started to deteriorate. The inside has started rubbing off on to my wrist. I wouldn't recommend wearing this as a regular band, I only use it for certain occasions."
2.0,Product broke the 2nd time I wore them.
2.0,"Like the idea of the dress, but returning because the stripes are uneven."
2.0,This wasn’t a great choice.
2.0,I was not completely happy with the top....The top was made for medium size doll....who is that small....Really!!! So I have to find a blouse for the skirt to complete the 2 pc set....Lesson learned will not order clothes with this company👎👎 through Amazon because you don't know what you are going to get....Amazon you need to dismiss this company...😕
2.0,"I'm 5ft 115 and xs small fit nice BUT the fabric was itchy and not soft. Cute design sleeves a bit long but I couldn't get past the feel of the fabric. Not cotton at all.  Amazon is hit or miss with fabric, found another dress that's very soft almost same style"
2.0,Okay so the purple one is the 2g I got from hot topic and the white one is the one I got from Amazon. They slip through what should be able to fit
2.0,"It’s a really cute top.  However, the size is way off!  I ordered an XXL and it fits like a medium."
2.0,Keeps the drink cold but there's no seal inside so it leaks. Don't know if I can find something to stop it from leaking.
2.0,They pilled after three washes.  But very comfortable
2.0,"Sized for a child. I ordered a medium, and I would need at least an XL for this to fit."
2.0,"Arrived nicely, all seemed to be in working until the first one broke with the first WEEK, I've made my own bracelets, just as this, and I wear them everyday, They break roughly every two years. In my opinion, from who makes these things, either learn to make them yourself ( You can buy a single of cool leather singles Earthbound or something similar like a nature store. Why settle for this clearly bad quality product, you can get the real good stuff. Hey, if you works for you, good luck!<br /><br />Good thing they came in backs."
2.0,This dress fits on the smaller side. Usually wear a small... it’s snug on my hips and chest area. Almost like a XS. The peachy color is pretty bright- like higher bright. It’s a little much.
2.0,Unflattering and too large. Might work for you if you’re on the taller side though!
2.0,Mine were small. The “adult” will fit my daughter and the “kid” will fit my niece when she is born in the winter.<br /><br />Cute and warm (says my daughter) but very small.
2.0,I bought this because the reviews said it looks real. It took forever to get delivered and looks like costume jewelry.
2.0,I love everything about the costume however it definitely runs small!!! Was disappointed in that.
2.0,They're flimsy plastic and don't grip well. I wouldn't buy them again or recommend them to anyone who wants to buy a decent pair of shades.
2.0,"Not really pleased with the product. The band wasn't a solid color. The stitching is white. It would have looked better with a silver face. Wanted to return it but the seller negotiated giving me a precentage off instead of me sending it back with shipping costing more than the band. Wasn't my ideal situation but, I appreciate their customer service."
2.0,not good donated to Goodwill
2.0,Kind of wished the gold on top was much thinner
2.0,"The fit was good and the material comfortable.  However, the leg bones are not painted all the way down the leg as pictured on the model.  The leg bones ended at the knee and looked quite silly."
2.0,"It was very pretty, but it runs too small. My daughter is 9 years old and it fit her extremely short. It barely covered her behind"
2.0,"Purchased the item and when it arrived I excitedly opened it up. Upon inspection, I was pleased. When I tried it on, I was very displeased. It was about 2 sizes to small. I returned the item for a full refund."
2.0,The stone fell out by the 3rd day . Don’t waste your money
2.0,"I was super excited to receive these a gift for Mother's Day from my husband since I am a librarian. However, after one day of wearing these earrings, they fell apart. The back picture of books came off both earrings. Luckily, they're double-sided so it's not a complete loss, but it was still disappointing."
2.0,"Doesn't go below my rear and I'm 5' 8"".  Had to stretch the material to get my head into hood.  It is surely made just for kids and they should say so."
2.0,These earrings are beautiful. My only issue is that they are mirrored as you can see in the picture and one earring says merry Christmas backward. They would be perfect if it wasn't for that. The leather is gorgeous.
2.0,"I’m getting this product two stars because the product did come in pretty quickly, it matched the description and pictures perfectly, and looks incredible especially if you’re a huge fan of Chris Kyle. However,  I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and unfortunately does not fit his truck steering wheel."
2.0,These are too stretchy. The material they are made n of sucks for sticking a pad to it too. They feel really loose too. I bought 2 packs prob going to return the unopened one.<br /><br />On the bright side they're comfy.
2.0,"Hubs took one look at these underwear and said, ""no way"".  Honestly, I think alpha males will have a problem with these.  It took me and my daughter a while just to figure out how they worked - way too complicated and I knew just from looking at them that hubs would not wear them.  Sorry, but if you want to keep your shirt tucked, buy one of those slender belts that keep them nicely tucked and wear your regular underwear."
2.0,This bra just kind of fits awkwardly. The band is snugger and I don’t feel like there is great support. The straps definitely dig into my shoulders. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,"I bought these gloves to replace another pair that were old and falling apart.  At first, these were great - comfy, warm, convertible - everything I was hoping for in fingerless gloves/mittens.  Only a few months later and they are practically worthless to me!<br /><br />The first issue I have is with the thumb.  It also is &#34;convertible&#34; allowing for you to expose the top of your thumb.  I thought this was pretty cool at first, since it allows me to use my thumb to grip things.  But after having worn these out in actual cold temperatures, this feature only servers to make sure that while the rest of my hand may be warm, a very specific part of my thumb is freezing - it is very uncomfortable...<br /><br />The 2nd issue that I have is that the sewing/stitching is TERRIBLE!  Just putting the gloves on for the first time, I could hear stitches popping.  I thought nothing of it at first, but now the lining is pulling away from the inside of the glove and is now falling out.  The velcro on teh outside that is supposed to hold the mitten part back has fallen off on both gloves.  The glove fit my hands perfectly, perhaps even slightly bigger than my hand, so it's not that the gloves are too small.  it's clear that the sewing was done without keeping in mind that the material is meant to be stretchy, which  is why the seams and stitching popped when I put them on.<br /><br />All in all - I need to buy another new pair of convertible mittens, so this was a waste of my money.  I will not be buying this brand again..."
2.0,The photo looks better. The fabric is cheap and the top is way too big.
2.0,All I ever where is this style kinda disappointed in how different the color is between them... big difference in the others I've got
2.0,I like the slippers but they send me size 9 instead of 7.5.  I hv to return it & purchase it again hopefully the next pair is the right size
2.0,Not what I taught.
2.0,Material is not soft and overall it looks like it was made for a really chunky kid. It's just not a flattering fit. Disappointed
2.0,"The outside pocket gapes open when carrying. Also, most importantly, the two inside pockets for key/phone fabric frayed so the pockets have openings to the inside of the lining.  Terrible.  This happened 4 months after using the purse.  You cannot return the purse if it is not in ""new"" condition unused are the words.  Beware."
2.0,"Perfect fit and the grey heather pattern wasnice, but it was too sheer! I didn't even have to bend over to see my underwear through the leggings. I can't imagine working out in these in public! Returned using amazon's free return policy."
2.0,Did not come in an Uggs box or with any Uggs instruction cards like I get from the store. Am doubtful they are real Uggs.
2.0,"This is my second time buying these. The first time they all looked amazing and were very polished and clean looking. This go around they are misshaped, the threads don’t go to the top, and the chains are uneven. I’ll have to return. There’s no fixing the problems."
2.0,Wow; Nike sizing has always been small. Then turned large. Got an 8.5; they are giant! The heel feels nice and squishy; the front has the same pieces on the bottom; but uncomfortable! 2 stars for looks! Great seller!
2.0,"This shirt isn’t at all what it looks like. It’s basically a crop top. Cute, but not as long as the picture would suggest."
2.0,I give it 2 stars because I like The Raiders  but the towel is ugly hard even wet. Bad product.
2.0,"Will serve it’s purpose but the printed design (entire reason I bought it) is off center. Since it has ear loops, centering it makes it not fit right on my ears. Fitting it properly makes it awkwardly off center. I posted 2 pictures to prove the point. It’s not so badly off that I won’t use it but I wish it was centered better."
2.0,"Fit the watch fine, but the durability is lacking.  The plastic 'square' that you tuck the end of the strap under broke after about a month of pretty tame use"
2.0,"I wear a size 8-10 pant and 36DD bra.  Purchased the Large thinking if I went a size up from a Medium that it would fit, however, WAY to tight up top and WAY to loose everywhere else.  If you have smaller breasts, you will probably be ok ordering your normal size. Very thin as well."
2.0,"I'm using the adjustable mesh band with the Fitbit Versa 2.  It's almost impossible to put the watch on without three hands and some unexpected wrist hair pulling.  It comes with two bands and neither are magnetic.  I was looking for the sort of thing I had on a smaller fitbit where it's one large band with a magnet on the end and you just slide it to a snug fit.  This one, the sliding part goes *under* the outer band (if you can slide it) and closes with a clasp.  Perhaps with a bigger wrist it would work just fine."
2.0,Love the thin fabric and short sleeves. Hate that there's no snaps at the crotch for diaper changes!
2.0,They make a crinkley sound when walking.
2.0,Doesn't look like her
2.0,They look like I bought them at the dollar store
2.0,"Received package in timely manner but package was slightly opened.The quality of the material was simply CHEAP.The dress had a hole in the front.I will pass this on to the goodwill,not worth returning."
2.0,I literally ordered a medium and it’s ridiculously huge and the sleeves have a weird fit. Don’t recommend
2.0,"The material feels soft, but I wish it was a little stretchy so it would move with your body easier as the top is a snug fit"
2.0,"The dress in the photo seems more like a cotton/linen type fabric however, what I received in the mail was more like a polyester/pillowcase type material.<br />Im 5'3 and weigh aprox 140 pounds.. the dress fit perfectly however.. the dress does not look good.<br /><br />Thank you, will be returning"
2.0,"Not 108 beads, cheap string, but pretty colors."
2.0,"The necklace broke after a couple of wears (the knots weren't tied well and were very confusing to adjust). I also only got one necklace, the black one."
2.0,The top wasn't as long as I assumed it would be and the skirt was shorter than the picture made it appear to be.
2.0,"My son didn't like the feel/ fit of the pants... I think more of a personal preference thing. Really bought the olive color because I needed to go with scout uniform,  it he didn't like it."
2.0,poor quality.. The package cost more than product  LOL
2.0,Emblem wearing off after one week.
2.0,"Beware!  I did not receive microsuiters, I received suiters.  The suiters are okay but if I had wanted the suiters I would have ordered the suiters."
2.0,"The sunglasses were okay at first, but after a few wears the sides of it became loose and uncomfortable.  I would not recommend."
2.0,"The &#34;rose gold&#34; colored metal parts were discolored with black marks, probably due to twisting through the black leather loop.  I returned the key chain for that reason, but I also thought it was a little too heavy to use for a car key."
2.0,Makes washing glass ware slippery
2.0,Repeats .
2.0,Order a size up if you want it to be off the shoulder.  Would not order again.
2.0,They kept coming down eventhough I have a chubby baby.<br />I returned them
2.0,"I received this in two colors, as a gift. While the sweatshirts are very soft, they both began to pill after the first wear, and even more so, after washing. I only wear them around home, now. Very disappointed in the quality of this brand."
2.0,"Never posted a bad review but this is just wrong. The quality of the material looks cheap and the fit is just wrong . I'm 5 '4 ,bust 32 A , waist 26,hips 40. I purchased the medium and top is too long and the pants don't fit right just under the butt area. Additionally,the middle of the bottom of the pants just does not fall as it should. My niece tried it on and sge had the same issue with the to even though she is bigger than me. Will be returning this."
2.0,Size 40 is too big and 39 is too small. I wear 8 1/2
2.0,I should have spent extra money
2.0,Poor quality. Came with hole in pocket and seam separating. Will keep for bathing suit cover up but not nice enough to wear out as dress.
2.0,Poor construction and fabric and sizing. I like the color but doubt I'll be wearing it unless I lose a considerable amount of weight (I wear size 8)!
2.0,I ordered a size larger than what the sizing chart indicated and it was still like 2 sizes too small! This is more like European sizing than USA sizing.
2.0,the size and the fabric
2.0,It fell apart and i almost lost my keys
2.0,I got what i paid for :(  Much too heavy for ear lobes
2.0,It looks cheap because it is cheap. For 5.99 it looks like 5.99... it’s really big and clunky. But I don’t hate it
2.0,Lasted less than 24 hours. Very light use I put them on my hands and in few hours I cloud see the threads out.<br /><br />Also I have small hands so it just fits my hand barely. If you have avg size or bigger hands then this is not for you.<br /><br />Giving 2 star only as it held moisture but for than paying 10 $ per day would be too expensive
2.0,"I did not like this dress. I wear a size 14-16 and I am curvy. I purchased size XXL. The most disappointing factor is the v-neck area does not stay put and flaps over. The dress is also super thin, so any unwanted bumps or rolls are going to show. If you do't have an itsy bitsy waist then you will need a tummy control shaper. I am 5'4 and the length is not as long as the photo appears either"
2.0,Poor band quality.
2.0,These earings are flimsy and the hook fell off the first time I put them on.
2.0,"way to small, i ordered large"
2.0,"Beautiful and good quality, but I couldn't get it to fit in my ear. I wasn't able to slide the gem in the middle to be able to maneuver it into both holes."
2.0,The chain is miniscule in comparison to the enlarged photo shown.  It feels so thin and week I am afraid to even wear it.  If it does break I'll never even feel it falling off !  Would not have made this purchase had I known it was like this.  Money wasted that could have been spent toward a better chain.
2.0,"alot bigger than I thought, more something you would hang on rearview mirror than wear. Cheap almost plastic-looking"
2.0,"I have waited since before Halloween of 2018 for the small size to be in stock. I’m 5’3” former ballet dancer about 105 lbs. When they arrived this afternoon, I was excited to try them on. Right out of the package, the design looked better than expected. However...  They fit me like a pair of scrubs, not leggings. They were tight enough to hold themselves up on my hips, but from the waistband down they were so loose I could have worn jeans under them. I really had my hopes up for a cute pair of leggings to show off my year round Halloween spirit, but sadly these were not cute at all."
2.0,"Not a good quality metal. Causes green stuff. I've had my daith for several years, so it's not a new piercing. Disappointed. Also, i would only get this if you don't mind the quality AND your piercing is on the right side."
2.0,"It's exactly as described, but, when I wore it the paint left red splotches on my wrist. It was hard to wash it off of my wrist."
2.0,"Pros: Cute, lightweight/breathable<br />Cons: Not a lot of support/thin material, removable cups don't look right but areolas can be seen thru the white material without the cups, straps are very flimsy and non-adjustable, after one wash (on delicate cycle in a delicates bag) it is covered in fuzz/""pills"" and, where the straps are sewn in, its fraying...<br />I wish I could return it but it's been washed (I was hoping the other complaints would have resolved after washing it but it only got worse)"
2.0,"I almost never review on Amazon , but this belt is Not quality.  Rough edges.  Size is not right,  too short.  The belt edges are very rough. I have purchased better belts at this price point. When this belt arrived I put it on right away.  It literally fell apart at the hook assembly by  the buckle.  Its screwed together.  No snaps.  The screws came right off"
2.0,It is cute but the fabric is uncomfortable and does not sit right.
2.0,It’s hard to find pants to fit a curvy figure so these were awesome... until they got a hole in them in just over a month of light wearing:( super bummed because the return window is now closed.
2.0,"The shoe fits as expected, so order your size.  They are cute but extremely uncomfortable and cheaply made.  The peep toe kept rubbing against the bed of my toe nail and was scraping me.  The upper portion of the bootie scratches against your leg.  I kept them because i wore them all day and had already discarded the box."
2.0,These are much shorter than expected
2.0,"i’ve the past year i’ve gained weight and i used to fit into a small but all of my shorts for the summer were too small. i’ve bought several pairs of shorts in mediums since the summer began and these were the first that didn’t fit. they fit barely any better than the small shorts that i’ve had previously. the material and everything is good,, but just size up!! for reference i’m 5’4 and 155 lbs!"
2.0,wish it come in a 2x
2.0,they’re pretty but they’re too small. I’m a size 0 and they keep falling out. this has never happened to me with other plugs.
2.0,The colors bled after wearing. If you buy this MAKE SURE you do not wash it with other clothes
2.0,Runs bigger but drops weird in the waist area. Had to return it- fabric was weird almost like a picnic table plastic cloth.
2.0,"Very nice quality, the fabric is superb but that sloths wayyyyy too high. I am 135 lbs, 5'4"" and the Medium was too big. I normally wear pants size 4-6, XS top. Hope this helps."
2.0,"Pretty cheap, clasp broke when i just dropped it on a counter. Get what you pay for i guess."
2.0,VERY SMALL BARELY COVER NIPPLES
2.0,it is not pvc its like rubber doz not keep form do not buy this waste of money
2.0,"I looked like a walking candy stick. The dress is tight, yet toooooo flowy. I don't know, it's just not flattering."
2.0,"Doesn't fit loose like photo, wasn't the same color as photo, it's bright red. Would've been cute if it was the right color."
2.0,"Ok, if you can use after first washing. Pants length shrink about 30%."
2.0,I've ordered a compression tank top before and I've had one that really holds everything in and together with a smell of feeliterally with a snug feeling this is a mediocre field but it does do some compression but it's very mild so if you're looking for something more tight fitting this might not be the right 1 for you
2.0,This item is huge.  It looks like what older women back in the 60's would have worn.  It is like a large Christmas tree decoration.  It would be a nice piece if it were about 1/4 or 1/3 the size.
2.0,"My friend bought this, when I bought the cheap one. They arrived and we compared. Mine is a slightly thinner polyester. Hers is a very slightly heavier weight polyester. She thought, probably based on the price tag, that this was silk. It is not silk. It is the same painted polyester they are selling in the other listing, just the tiniest bit heavier. The same loose threads, the same slight irregularities, beautiful, but not silk and not worth more than ten or so above the price of the slightly thinner robe. Good luck finding what is right for you."
2.0,I'm returning the swim suit because it was obviously worn. It had deodorant stains and the inside cups are dirty and stained. Very disappointed.
2.0,Length is very short.  I would only recommend them for kids.
2.0,"They are not what was described, not even close to being mirrored or chrome finish"
2.0,they are great quality feeling however the heel started to come off one and i wore them only twice... it sucks i really liked them at first
2.0,"Thin, cheap, very see through... more than expected. The pink and black are ok and usable but the white is bad... it went in the trash. You know those cheap nylon “socks” you use in stores to try on shoes... the ones that rip super easy? That’s about the quality level of these tights."
2.0,Bend and break easily
2.0,"I usually wear a size 28 jeans, so I ordered that size in these pants. Way too big, everywhere, and the length must be made for tall women because they were extremely long. I wanted them for a ski trip. Very disappointed, although Amazon has a great return policy for Prime members,  which I appreciate."
2.0,"As a girl with a big belly. I’m about an XL but like to buy 2XL for more loose comfortable fitting. Let me tell you, this wasn’t it. At 5”7 I already knew the length was ridiculous short and it was tighter in the torso. It felt like a shirt. Not good material either."
2.0,"Runs small.  Very poor sewing.  I don't expect it would hold up to much wear, but stylish for a couple times a season wear.  Ordered it for Christmas in early December, but arrived the week after.  Slow boat from China."
2.0,"Hat is great, but don't sweat in it.  Purchased two of these.  One was destroyed because I sweated while golfing and the other while at a lake boating.  They do not wash (I hand wash) as stains will remain between the bill and head of the hat.  Scrubbing doesn't even work.  Good for a short term &#34;look at me I'm cool for rocking an American flag hat&#34;, and that's about it.  If you don't plan on ever using this in an environment that you might sweat or have water around it then this might be the best hat for you!"
2.0,"I love the band/velcro closure, but the pin won't stay on the watch.  One pin has come off about 10 times already and I've only had the band for a few days.  I'm afraid I'm going to lose my watch (Garmin Vivoactive 4S).  It just doesn't fit the watch properly."
2.0,Boarding pass does NOT fit
2.0,"It is a LOT of heavy fabric. The train is long and weighs you down in the back you will probably need a bridal bustle. It's pretty but sort of ""dated"" in person. Perks are built in bra cups and corset style back. The bummer is you have to pay to return it (didn't know this upon buying) which it weighs almost 3 pounds so good luck $$"
2.0,I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT ON THE VERY FIRST DAY OF USE ONE OF THE RODS THAT SUPPORT THE OPENING OF THE UNBRELLA BENT IN HALF WAS NOT ABLE TO USE ANYMORE .
2.0,"Smaller than I thought, and too light weight. Giving them to Goodwill."
2.0,Comfortable.. I've had them for about a month and the stitches are coming undone around the opening where your foot slides in.  They're comfortable though and the  Soul of the slipper is durable.. just with they weren't falling apart where the 2 toned fabric comes together..
2.0,It’s s ring
2.0,About 30% of these earrings arrive broken. The huggie lever back closure never snapped or closed right on about a third of these earrings. The post back ones are great.
2.0,"It is a comfy shirt, for running and barre, but not so much yoga as it just falls into your face. But it started fraying after one wear - which is fine given the price point."
2.0,I like how they are shipped and how well you can see out of the lenses. But the construction of the glasses are very flimsy and are easily broken.
2.0,"It is sorta warm, but it is definitely pretty cheaply made. It’s an ehhh from me"
2.0,"bought this for my goddaughter; shes turning two this year. got a 3-4 years to be safe because shes pretty tall; if it didn't fit now she'd fit into it eventually. NOPE. thing looks like it was made for a small one year old. didn't even try to get it on her, no way it would have fit comfortably.<br />disappointed because it IS very cute."
2.0,"Okay, so this dress is really strange.  It fits me perfectly weight wise, but... it's too long.  It's way too long.  The fabric is gorgeous, the dress flowed prettily.  I actually liked how it buttoned up all the way, although you guys should know that it buttons up all the way, so look out, that could be tedious.  Anyway, I couldn't wear it because it's so long that it drags on the ground after me."
2.0,Not cut well for big guys
2.0,did not fit like the other vionic shoes i ordered not enough room in the toe area would not order again
2.0,"I just got back from a few weeks in Italy, gave this bag a work out ! It`s stylish, seems pretty well constructed, but there were things I didn`t like about it : the flap is only held shut by two of those cheap magnetic snaps, that pop open when you are carrying a heavy load in the bag. I passed on buying other bags for the same reason, I thought that strap on the front was functional, it is not, just cosmetic. Didn`t see that in the description, or the photo`s of the bag. Also the shoulder strap is a very smooth material, that tends to slip and get longer with use, and had to be readjusted every couple days. If you are using the bag to carry a very small amount of stuff around, it might be what you want. I was carrying 3-5 lbs. of guide books, tablet, camera, water bottle, etc. at any given time, and had the described problems with this bag. Not the bag I was looking for."
2.0,Way too small. Order 2x your normal size
2.0,The fit on this dress was perfect. Just the material was cheap and thin. There was double layering in the chest area which is ideal. Overall would be a beautiful dress if they thickened up the material. I'll be returning it.
2.0,"Lesser quality than expected, looks dull compared to advertisement, hollow backed."
2.0,"Kind of disappointed. They arrived quick like I expected, medium size which is perfect BUT they have black spots all over them which is not good at all! These are for my wedding which has nothing black and they’d be noticeable. Not work $10"
2.0,"Just received my bag today, and am very pleased with the QUALITY of the product. BUT...not included is the shoulder strap as pictured!! This is a big problem, as I need to carry this bag over my shoulder, otherwise it's useless to me.. Do I have to return the item, or will Oflamn just send me the strap? I went from delighted to disappointed in two seconds flat."
2.0,"I have a long torso so it fit weird. Went way up my butt but was still too loose in the bust. I’m 5’6, 133lbs with a 34C bust."
2.0,I absolutely love the way this product feels.<br />I ordered an XL but it definitely is waaay too small. More like a medium. Which bites because neither me or my daughter wears a medium so now it's just sitting here cuz we can't wear it. Sad.
2.0,"I ordered my regular size on this dress and everything fit fine, except the waist. The fabric bunched up around where the smocking separates from the bottom portion of the dress. It made me look like I was pregnant. I returned this dress because of that."
2.0,Fit was way off. It was a gift for my husband and I used the size chart. I bought him a medium even though he always wears a large in sweatpants. They were way way way too long. But tight in the waist. No way any size could work for him. Had to return. He’s 5’7” btw so these pants not meant for shorter men.
2.0,"Cheap and flimsy, hat with an iron-on sticker as the logo."
2.0,"Its really cute but it really painful lmao. every time I take it off after wearing for not even a long period of time, it feels like my nose is broken lol"
2.0,The style is nice but the construction is poor. The white lining peeks out on the top of the garment. The bottom rides up and shows your behind. I wore it to the beach this week and because of the aforementioned issues more than likely I wont wear it again. I would pass on this. It’s cheaply made and it shows in the construction.
2.0,I order to large and the band already came off.
2.0,The shirt is much cuter in the photo... I don't care for the material it's very thin so if your skin is super white like mine you can totally see thru the shirt :(
2.0,Super excited about the color and fit bit after wearing only twice visible pilling. Washed on delicate inside out.
2.0,"The chain snapped off. Poor quality, but what do you expect?"
2.0,It was my size but run small
2.0,Much too small and unable to return
2.0,"Great looking glasses, BUT. Loved the shape, spring hinges and subtle wood-grain were as pictured, but I had two issues with them: Within 2 months all three pairs had broken with normal use. Also, the screws in the hinge kept backing out, requiring I screw them back in at least once a day, using one of those little screwdrivers you can buy in the grocery line here in the US. As such, though I loved the style, I cannot recommend these."
2.0,"These boots are cute but so uncomfortable I wish i could return them. They are so tight on the top of your foot (particularly the right shoe) that i would start to lose circulation and had an indent around the top of my foot when i took them off. I tried to stretch them out but that didn’t work, and in doing so, missed the return window.  They are also extremely hard to put on as there is no side zipper. My feet are not wide or anything so that is not the reason for the bad fit. Rather upset I wasted all that cash and have no boots."
2.0,"Poor quality, didn't last long"
2.0,Material is not flexible and the material was kinda itchy and did not fit right. i only gave it 2 stars because it was cute.
2.0,Didn't get to use them
2.0,"The fit is okay, but the color is not the same as the picture.  I ordered this in green and the shirt it more of a blue-green."
2.0,"I did not like the short sleeve version of this tunic top.  I have three of the long sleeved shirts in the same brand. I love those!  This was disappointing. The material is not as nice as the long sleeved version. Its very polyester.  It also hangs differently than the long sleeve version and is not as flattering.  It's ok, but not quite what I was expecting."
2.0,To small need the lg not med
2.0,This was not a shawl it was a scarf
2.0,Doesn't look like this.  It broke the first time I used it.  Already threw it away.
2.0,This skirt had lumps and bumps in the seams and was very poorly made. I threw it away.
2.0,"The mask itself fits well for kids and adults with smaller ears like me. I planned to use them at work and for my kids. The images on the masks faded immediately after the very first wash! I hadn't even worn them yet and it not only looked like they were months old, but the  picture ink bled all over the rest of the white mask. To have to throw away 2 on day one due to this is insane for the price. They few that had vinyl printing held up nice. The majority didn't and look horrible now."
2.0,"It is a genius prevention, but power starter does not work every time. But I still like it, after all, it works most of the times, an easy kitchen toy for a 75 year young lady."
2.0,"They were really cute, but didn't stay on my head....the material is so slippery, they slide right off"
2.0,I wanted to love this because it's really cute but it was just too big do I had to return it. I normally wear a small or 6-8.
2.0,Runs small and no flexibility in fabrics.
2.0,Runs small. Pants is short shirt tight was not tailored nicely
2.0,"The first time I wore each pair, I was very happy.  After one wash however, the anti-slip strip comes off, so your socks fall down the whole time you are out.  It drove me so crazy, I took them off and walked around the rest of the day without socks.  The socks are very thin and breathable, but can't be worn more than once!!!  If you want to actually be able to wash your socks and wear them again, buy something different."
2.0,Did not get the color is requested and the material ripped after two washings.
2.0,"While the item looks as advertised, any statement as to the size of the item is grossly inaccurate.  I wear a men's 2XL t-shirt.  I purchased this t-shirt in 3XL.  This t-shirt does not even come close to fitting on me.  At best, it's a men's medium.  I don't know whose sizing charts they are using, however, it isn't a US sizing chart.  I'm giving this t-shirt a 2-Star rating, because, if it had fit as advertised, it would have been perfect."
2.0,Discolored in 2 days . But still pretty.
2.0,I ordered based on the stated shoe sizes and found they were way too small.
2.0,Item was extremely small.
2.0,The ring is thin and not as bulky or impressive as in the post.
2.0,Just like
2.0,Love the print elastics in the legs are wayyyyy tooo tight ☹️ Couldn't go one size up because too would be too big...so I wasted my money
2.0,Too short and shows cleavage  Not appropriate.  You have to pay UPS charges to return it.
2.0,Only giving it 2 stars because its very cute but it is way to BIG! It looks like a 12-18 months and I ordered a 6-12 because my daughter is 7 months and will be wearing it for a family reunion when shes 9 months thinking that it should fit her but it will definitely be a while before she can wear it. She wears a 6-9 and its a little big on her.
2.0,the printing was awesome my 2x shirt was made to fit a medium.i couldnt believe how small and no stretch at all none.
2.0,Not anything like the picture. The silver wrap around the stone tarnished the first week & the loop has broken off. Poorly put together.
2.0,"Stitching was terrible. Darts on bust area were crooked and didn’t match up, making breasts look lopsided and significantly different sized. Material was acceptable, length and size were all good, I liked the dress but ended up returning due to the stitching. For reference: size xl 5’7” 160, 34G Hourglass body shape."
2.0,"This pant was aweful. I don't know how they have got so good reviews. It is quite larger than the size chart. I can understand lengthwise long but it is very wide also. Material was torn. I don't know if I got a bad piece or that is how it is. Also you have to pay for the return unlike most of the amazon products. So be aware of that. This was my first order in this brand, i'll not order anything from this brand as quality is quite poor and better linen pants are available in the same price. I bought it as navy is not commonly available with other brands but i'll not recommend this to anyone."
2.0,"The body part fit true to size, but the sleeves were very short. I needed about 2 more inches on them. The material also wasn't very soft, it was stiff and scratchy. I am 5'7 and ordered a S."
2.0,Can't really give a star review as these were too small to get my feet into. I went half a size up on what I normally wear and couldn't even get my foot in.
2.0,I liked the color block that's why I ordered them so I'm not happy about this.  I can wear them cause I don't want my hole to shrink
2.0,needed plastic inserts
2.0,the quality of this product is not satisfactory and will not work for my phone even though it is the correct size.
2.0,"As so many other reviewers have stated, it's only printed on one side. The white color is raised (not stamped) as if it's rubber or paint or something. I don't mind the texture, but since I've seen that some cheap bandanas have contained lead paint, I'm kind of concerned this one might but didn't have a sticker stating such. The only pros are that the lilac color is pretty, and it's large - otherwise, I'm kind of afraid to put it on my head."
2.0,Not quite the size of a penny in width.  Very small.  Would not even give this to a child.
2.0,I love the dress but the stitching around the waist is coming out.  Have worn and washed about 5 times.  Very disappointing.
2.0,"The black pants that were sent are the correct size, but unfortunately the brown pants were a size too small. The medium is almost too small for me as is, so the small size definitely seems too small. These do look just like what is in the picture though. I think I'm a bit disappointed in the fabric quality too, but they are very cheap, so hopefully they will hold up ok. The brown in the small are also not the correct brand, so that is a bit strange too."
2.0,Washed once and the mermaid print came off!
2.0,Looks great but after wearing it for five minutes it fell off.  The chain detached from the necklace.  We fixed it with needle nose plyers.
2.0,The post is too big to get through my piercing<br />I am disappointed
2.0,"Pretty, but clasp is cheap and broke the first time I tried to put it on. Lobster clasp is very hard to open."
2.0,Purchase came in 3x instead of xl size otherwise product is good
2.0,"I really liked this chain when I received it -- lightweight, sleek, doesn't tangle.  But the chain broke after less than two weeks of wear."
2.0,Cute top but the fabric became fuzzy from my purse strap. I’ve never had a top do this before. A shame because it’s noticeable and was only worn one time. Kind of a waste of money.
2.0,I very much dislike these pants. The material is that of swimsuits. That is not a pleasant feeling on normal days. I don’t like how they feel at all. The cut would be fine with a different material. Pants should not be this material. Even leggings would be odd in this material.
2.0,"Cheap, kind of gaudy - too small to ft any normal persons ankle... and I have tiny ankles."
2.0,"Probably okay for a one time use. The Very thin material, didn’t hold up to a 4 year old wearing it. By 45 days seams are out and some areas wearing thin. Having sewed with cheap satins I can see this is probably the thinnest, cheapest material available ...."
2.0,It fit poorly and it felt like 80’s jogging suit material. The kind that makes the swishing noise when you walk! LoL. Just keep scrolling. May have been better if it was true to size and cotton?
2.0,"The item is to much small,"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:78e62552d357372669000581a8bb1c0e]] They are sturdy belts but the buckle is not it only lasted 2 months
2.0,"Cute but small.  I am a very typical 9, can often wear 8.5, but these must go back - too small."
2.0,"I was disappointed with my purchase.  I guess it depends on your head size, but these glasses fell short at the back of my head and felt too small and narrow."
2.0,Sad these shoes are no good. Super cute but we bought them in February and by April the Velcro ripped off the shoe so he can't wear them anymore.
2.0,I was incredibly disappointed in these boots. My daughter did not even get a full day's wear out of them before one of the buckles broke and now they are not wearable. They were really cute...too bad!
2.0,Runs small. I sized up one and could have gone with another. I’m a 38D and the ladies had to be poured in and all day i was concerned one would pop out bc there’s not much keeping them contained. Flattering in waist but otherwise eh
2.0,"You get what you pay for. The metal charms has a very rough unfinished look. The spots where the long strap connects are already falling apart after daily use for 3 months. The size is great and the, but the quality is very poor. Save your money and find a different purse."
2.0,"1) CON It gaps open over the bust, a lot. I won't be able to wear it.<br />2) CON The material is very thin. It shows the outline of the undergarment in the back. (You might be able to avoid this by buying a bigger size.)<br />3) PRO The material is stretchy.<br />4) PRO The cut is flattering.<br /><br />CONCLUSION Once again, Amazon has my money and I don't have what I want. :( When will I ever learn? Too frequently, either the item I buy is too cheap to return (two items this month) or I wait too long to return it. (1 item this month) I'm going to a brick & mortar today. Then, I try out the clothing or object before I buy it. Amazon... We've had a long friendship. But, it looks like it's waning."
2.0,Not impressed With Quality or fit
2.0,"I wear a US size 12, bra size about 38C the boobs were extremely tight. It also had a small stain and does not stretch at all. You cant tell in the photos but the designs are sligthly different on the chest area."
2.0,Eh. Not impressed. I really needed 30 and one of the paddles was broken.
2.0,quality not really good
2.0,"I absolutely love this bracelet. However, it bends very easily, so I don't wear it as often as I would like. It's a beautiful piece, I just wish the silver was more durable."
2.0,wrong choice of item. It wasn't what I expected
2.0,"I'm not a big fan of the materiel and they are slightly see through. I was pretty excited to buy them for the first time. I tried it on it fits fine I ordered XS I usually wear size S I would say they are slightly bigger in size. Im 5'5 - 115 pounds. I put these yoga tights to the test and they failed sadly :( do not stay on while exercising. Overall the price is not bad, they look cute maybe to wear around the house."
2.0,"Fabric is rough for a microfiber, and items have raw edges, which will likely lead to fraying after normal wash and wear. Also don't like the large logo - on both ends! Interesting that they are folded in packaging to NOT show there is a logo. Returning."
2.0,"Over all they're decent shorts. They have a nice length, and felt nice. However they have zero stretch and the extra large was not what I'd consider an extra large."
2.0,Would have liked it if I ordered a smaller size. Everybodies reviews are so mixed on here so I ordered larger. I’m normally a small and ordered a medium.. the shirt would be super cute if it didn’t look like I got it out of my grandmas closet. It’s a LOT brighter than the picture. Close to embarrassing. Maybe if I wash it a few times it’ll fade and shrink. But definitely order your normal size. The material is nice. But the make of the twist at the bottom is a little messy. Could be cute though... maybe a different color than the beige.
2.0,"Too synthetic, compared to my expectations<br />Well: it was a great deal, anyway. I'll use it as a souvenir for some friend of mine"
2.0,the pants is not a regular xl. im not sure if Hurley xl is smaller than other brands but this just isn't the right fit.<br />Very nice material though
2.0,Looks cheap. Has a 3d glittery effect when looking at it in the light. I wouldn't wear it in public. I would have when I was 13. Im thinking about giving to my niece. Also its 30mm... Small..
2.0,"I've had these about 2 months. I've been wearing them on and off along with a couple pairs. Yesterday when I went to put them in, the honeycomb shattered. My finger went straight through. I'm willing to chalk this up to user error, but it still makes me feel like these are not fit for daily use. beware and be gentle if you purchase these plugs"
2.0,I was excited to get these until I put them on... Didn't even come close to fitting. The quality of which they are made is good but if you decide to do it I'd buy at least 2 sizes to big
2.0,i bought a large according to size chart and there was no way they would fit.
2.0,no clasp--chain is weak
2.0,These shoes felt great the first month. The fabric between the sides and front top stretched out and lost it’s shape thus the shoes felt sloppy and way too large.
2.0,I like the romper I'm 5'8 so it was long enough. I just didn't like that it was see through the material is thin
2.0,The fabric is much thinner than expected.  The color is much more of a pale peach than expected of a color described as coral.
2.0,The dress is beautiful but it was to small and I ordered it a size bigger
2.0,"I wear 12-1/2 to 13 men's shoe size. Bought these size 13M slippers because most reviews said true to size. Not so!  My toes were crunched against the font and the heel end band was tight and painful on my Achilles tendon. Seems like good construction, but a size 13M is NOT a size 13"
2.0,the cap is made nicely it's just to small for my head
2.0,Had this for a year and it seems as it stretched from the neck/shoulders like it's too big n stretch y
2.0,Not too sturdy. The quality could’ve been better. Some parts were missing and a few pieces are peeling. I’m disappointed because I paid mire thinking I’d get better quality. Though I do enjoy making these bracelets.
2.0,"It seems like a comfortable dress that fits true to size; however, I just tried it on (straight from the package) and it has a hole in the waist seem and in the right pocket :-/"
2.0,It arrived a tangled mess. It also catches on clothing as well. Very poorly constructed.
2.0,"It's cheap. It works. But, it won't shut up! Apparently, once the power is applied, I need to press 'pause' to stop the sound. It will play EVERY file on the SD card. And then repeat it! WHAT USE IS THAT? I want it to play 1 file, then wait for me to trigger the next file. This thing can't do that."
2.0,The sleeves were extremely loose and baggy almost as if someone stretched it out over their leg. The slit does not go up as high as shown in the picture. The seam on the side/slit seam was weird and made a couple bumps and did not fit smoothly to my form. Not cute. Returning.
2.0,Item not true to fit. Several sizes too small.
2.0,Watch is very heavy and sticks up very high if you are going to wear it with a dress shirt also hard to see at night all the different colors end so can’t see hands
2.0,does not fit right.  Either than insert is too small or the outside shell is too large but neither fit correctly.
2.0,Item not as pictured.  Still cute and fits well the short sleeves are white with little perforated holes designed.
2.0,The bag material is very thin and doesnt look classy at all.<br />packaing nice.. amazon delivery excellent!
2.0,"So very small , sent back. Plus no free returns."
2.0,Very cheap material. Would NOT buy again.
2.0,One size fits all is bogus. I wear lg in leggings. These are not one size fits all. Way too small.
2.0,"This shirt is so short, it looks insane. It barely reaches my pants, and because it’s so short the belt doesn’t work. Very disappointed, it had potential to be a great shirt but looks nothing like it does on the model."
2.0,Broken so easily ..
2.0,"Size & style are great. Color is not. I ordered gold, it looks more yellow."
2.0,"Very cute crown but the colored ""jewels"" fall off instantly. I re-glued them with heavier glue so hopefully it fixes the issue."
2.0,The Z came off.
2.0,Garment was very snug at the hips.
2.0,I was confused when I attempted to try this on. I ordered the size appropriate to an 18-20 and if I pulled it up like pants it fit everywhere through my mid section fine but when I try to put it on normally it was extremely narrow through the shoulders. I could not even get it all the way up on my arms to try to put it over my head. It was as if an 18-20 midsection was put with a size 10 shoulders and arms.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:5b672471767590fe897eac279acfa43]] This mask would have been cool, IF it hadn't been rolled up into a small little roll. It was folded in half, which I get, but then also rolled up then taped around the package, to make the whole think about as big as my fist, which left it too distorted. The eyebrows are misshapen, the nose is totally crooked (even for a witch) the cheeks and chin are collapsed, and the eyelids are poking inwards, which is the worst part as I cannot wear it because they literally poking into my eyes. And the package it came out was 5 times the size of the mask, so there was no need at all to roll it up like this! Maybe it would be ok for a prop, but my intent was to wear it, which I cannot. So I'm returning it and hopefully will find another by Halloween!"
2.0,"Had to return. The masks were way too big for my 3 year old. It covered my son’s entire face, including his eyes. The material seemed nice and thick though. I wouldn’t advertise them as toddler masks."
2.0,No support. The straps at the bottom I hoped would at least give some support...but they may as well not even be there.
2.0,I thought the circles where going to be bigger o just gave them away. It’s made for a chilx
2.0,Really wanted this belt to work but it wouldn't stay clasped with any pressure at all applied. I'm hoping it was an individual defect and am trying to get a replacement to see if it's a one-off issue. Will update if replacement arrives and works properly.
2.0,"First of all, the color of the watch faces are just beautiful.  However, one of the watch I received was all scratched and it's important the pink one!  So Ok, I am willing to overlook that since there were 10 of them.  The next issue I have is it is impossible to remove the links, I know how to remove links, these pins are not removable and these the cheapest metal material I've ever seen.  Don't bother buying these unless your wrist fits these watches.  Totally NOT worth even free shipping free returns, you can't remove links anyway!  Returned immediately!"
2.0,This product was returned. It didn't fit true to size at all for me.
2.0,This was way to big. It was way to big and baggy and just looked sloppy. It was made well but not made for me.
2.0,I liked these socks when they arrived. Super cute and fit well. I bought them to wear to Disneyland. But. Mid day i noticed my toes were burning like they were on FIRE! I took the socks off and my feet were red and swollen. I washed these socks before wearing as i do all my new clothing. I took them off and washed my feet with cool water. Eventually the burning and redness went away.
2.0,"I ordered the black and white chevron print first and it’s gorgeous, fits beautifully and is long enough. I am 5’6 114-118 pounds, 32D, 25, 34.  I ordered the black and red next hoping for the same fit- entirely different and very unflattering. It’s also cotton where the other was 97% polyester and 3% spandex. The top is lose and bunches and balloons out where the red attaches to the black and there is no similarity between the color lines. I’m keeping it as a coverup for the pool because I’m too lazy to send it back."
2.0,The sides of the glasses are too wide and block most of your side vision
2.0,"Way to small. If you got big upper arms, these will not fit you at all. I would suggest looking elsewhere. They don’t come in different sizes so that’s the downfall."
2.0,Very comfy but they do not keep you warm at all.
2.0,I bought this for my daughters after swim practice outside. It’s zipper is very sticky and it is hard to zip up and down only after about a month of use.
2.0,"If you are full-figured with hips and ass, forget it."
2.0,I'll start off by saying that yes its a beautiful watch. But its not automatic. It has to be wound once a day every day.
2.0,"Looked nothing like the picture, I should have listened to someone else's review on this. There is very little of the gold visible, looks like a plain matte finishe beige bracelet"
2.0,"This outfit is so cute, and I was really looking forward to dressing our son in it for his baptism. But I was so disappointed when it arrived, the size is WAY off! I ordered the 0-3 month size, because he’ll only be a few weeks old at his baptism, but it looks more like 6-9 month! Thank goodness for free returns."
2.0,"Pretty poncho style top but i purchased another from another buyer and it was the exact same product almost (different color) but only $14.99 instead of almost $40. Price is ridiculous for the product. Material snags very easily so buyer beware! I wouldn't recommend at this price point. Also, the tag is in the stupidest place ever and again, the material is super thin so it's hard to remove without damaging it."
2.0,I got a small and it’s way too big.
2.0,"I was really excited to get this set, and I did receive the set as shown. I'm giving it 2 stars because only the clicker post is stainless steel. I am severely allergic to most cheap metals especially nickel, and I would guess the decorative part and the hinge is nickel. Very sad this won't work for me..... My nose is swollen and sore :("
2.0,Jewels were small and L post was too short. Couldn’t get the ball unscrewed for the iridescent hoops
2.0,Slips off easily.
2.0,Too long in the torso. Did not feel like shapewear as it was almost mesh and very thin.
2.0,The protective film came off before we even used it!
2.0,"Not too fond of the fabric, stitches are poor made and it was too large"
2.0,"Nice color, but cheap looking."
2.0,"Great for the price. I didn't realize it was ribbed, but it still adhered to my cricut vinyl."
2.0,"Even fastened on the smallest link, this choker is too large for my neck."
2.0,Sloppy enamel makes it look super cheep.
2.0,"I ordered this necklace to fancy up a plain dress for our stay at home Christmas.  Is this necklace fancy?  No. Is it good quality? No. Is it well made? No... lol.  It is plastic gems pinned to a piece of black felt.  When it arrived, every single gem was scratched to the point where they were foggy.  I put some clear nail polish over them and it helped.  As you can see by the picture, it got the job done.  Would I wear this necklace to a wedding .. hahaha! NO! But I might for pictures or something."
2.0,Wife said it was smaller than what the size said.
2.0,Doesn't not fit according to description.
2.0,If you have thighs they’ll be tight on you at the end like their cutting your circulation. The sewing on them aren’t that great either.
2.0,It’s definitely extremely thin.  As for size goes it was 2 sizes to small.  I ordered a large because my son is a large and it was way to small.  Fabric extremely thin.  I would consider it a summer shirt.  The design is pretty but the fabric is cheap.  It should only be worth $5 I could maybe see paying $10 at the very max.
2.0,metal frame looks like cheap plastic.
2.0,"I am not a big fan of the material its very stretchy and see thru, but over all its a nice dress."
2.0,"itchy. flimsy, tacky."
2.0,"They are HUGE. Very loosely fit. They fit my husband's head, not made for smaller women"
2.0,All the fingers are the same length.  Who has hands like that?  Creepy.
2.0,"I returned because the fabric was just too cheap to wear anywhere.  The cut was attractive though.<br /><br />I buy many, many items from Amazon and seldom return anything...but to be fair to this item, I returned 9 out of 10 clothing items in this order because of the cheap fabric.  Since any return is a hassle, I will not be ordering more clothing items."
2.0,Made of swim suit material. Not what I was expecting.
2.0,"Received strap...3 weeks from UK. Buckle was faulty and would not stay attached to strap, which could be a bit of a problem with a watch band. Geckota was apparently sending replacement...5 weeks nothing. Refund processed."
2.0,Llegaron como de niños. Nada que ver
2.0,you will need a thick slip unless you want everyone to see everything.  Prints are pretty and as described but I could not work with the inmodest fabric. My suggestion to the vendor is to 3-4 ply the current fabric for a better skirt.  This would definitely sell well.
2.0,"i really thought it would be thicker, but its slightly thicker than paper. seems strong though-but thickness would be very reassuring. also the hinge spring that came mine makes a clicking noise,as if will break out of place if i flex my wrist. oh well"
2.0,The watch was nice and my daughter was excited. Sadly it was not functioning due to a dead battery.
2.0,"It doesn't fit and is too soft, no real structure. I'd return it..."
2.0,"When it was not broken, I really liked this belt.  It seemed sturdy and the ratchet worked well to tighten the belt to my preference.  However, after a few months of wearing it, the buckle mechanism suddenly fell apart for no apparent reason.  The pin that holds the ratchet came loose and allowed itself to slip through the retaining holes in the buckle and the rest of the ratchet self-disassembled once the pin came out.<br /><br />I would really have liked to give this belt a good rating because other than the weak design of the buckle parts retention, it seems like a good quality belt.  But with the weak design of the retaining pin, I'd have to recommend that potential buyers avoid this product."
2.0,I bought it as a gift for my best friend bday the clasps is breaking..a month later. It look nice though
2.0,Great idea and the light is very bright. However I now have to give this two stars because it lasted less then a year before it split in half and broke.  If you don't mind the 1 year life span then this is a good value.
2.0,"Too heavy. Earring droop forward when wearing them. Very cute design though, too bad you can’t see the rose."
2.0,"All of the spikey balls have broken, which was the only reason I got these rings in particular! :("
2.0,"Looks exactly as pictured, however the mask is flat and mashed my nose down. Not great quality, it broke in half when it fell off of a low shelf. Would not recommend."
2.0,Cheap poor construction. Flimsy.  Broke within a week.  Looks cute but do not recommend buying it.
2.0,"The design of the shirt is awesome and the material is soft as hell, but after 2 washes an XL  doesn't even reach my belt.  unacceptable.  definitely buy a size - or two - larger to be safe."
2.0,These are really heavy and clunky...wouldn't recommend
2.0,"Very pretty but they do NOT stay in place. In order for the wing to stay up, you have to squeeze the hook to make it smaller, but then it’s painful to wear."
2.0,"They weren't non-slip like the description says, im a skinny girl and they were extremely tight around my thighs. Other than that they are great, but they are too tight around my thighs and they don't stay up they roll as a matter of fact."
2.0,"Omg, the cut of this thing. I wear a size 4 normally and thought that a Small would be right, but it’s TINY. It’s also chiffon, and I somehow thought the photos made it look like cotton. The arm hole is big so that you can see my bra, but the bodice is so tight that my armpit oozes out."
2.0,It’s a t shirt. Not even a long one
2.0,"The outfit itself is pretty. The size is way small. Ordered a 22. My friend who is a size 10 could barely get it on.  Charged $70 extra for shipping.  To return the item,  it is $101 shipping because it is in China."
2.0,very poor materiel
2.0,"Shirt is adorable, but sized smaller than expected. I ordered a 2x (I normally wear an X-Large, but wanted this to fit a bit bigger)… it fits more like a Large. There was no tag inside the shirt to indicate size, but the package said 2xl."
2.0,Came in large
2.0,Like the dress has a seam up the front that clearly is mismatched in alignment of pattern.
2.0,Sheer if stretched in the slightest.
2.0,"So thin that I can easilly see through it!  I  just got it today, and it has a couple of lines in it that look like runs in a stocking. It is very soft.  Was hoping it would be a bit warmer and of better quality."
2.0,It’s very cute !my daughter loves it but like everybody said you cant easily put him on the horse .you can spread the legs and force it really hard to hug the horse but the body weight is too much and the horse just falls over with the Pedro thus making having the horse not functional.Knowing that I would not have bought it and do not recommend unless you just want Pedro in his uniform.
2.0,It would’ve been nice if it was embroidered
2.0,Pretty but cheaply made. The back bent the first time I put them on.
2.0,Need to order one size up. The Material is great good quality.
2.0,"Definitely not Burgundy like the photo suggests which is very disappointing, i really really really wanted it to be true Burgundy and it’s more of a bright wine red. On the plus side it was shipped very quickly and is super comfortable."
2.0,So pretty but fell off the chain with in 2 weeks
2.0,I ordered this for my husband but it is too short for him.  It is better suited for a tween than a grown man.
2.0,At least 2 sizes too small.  Material is not denim as I know it to be.  It is denim colored.
2.0,Item arrived on time and is acceptable quality for the price; however the mask was missing! That is an essential part of the outfit. Will buy from different vendor next time.
2.0,"Nothing wrong with the pants, but the baggy harem girl style did not look good on me. I will be returning these."
2.0,"The gloves are... WEIRD. They are too large, misshapen and on one hand the fingers are longer than the other. Too long. And I have long fingers. Also they are supposed to be texting gloves but all they did was use a different color yarn on two of the fingers tips. They are useless. The hat and scarf seem fine and are a beautiful color."
2.0,"I had to cut off the end of the watch band, but even so, it is too large. Will have to throw away."
2.0,no le quedo a smartwatch ID205L
2.0,Most of the equipment was decent but the headlamp was not that great of quality.  It seem like a toy rather than something to take on a serious run.  In addition I had a difficult time getting it to stay in the upright position and there were scratches on it when I received.  I had to use it because my race was the following day but I would have return it all if that was not the case.
2.0,The product itself looks like the picture but as I took these out of the packaging to put in my jewelry box one fell apart.  I had to get my husband to put it back together for me.
2.0,Not at all what I expected they are cute but very flimsy if you’re not careful they will brake easily here is the pictures to prove it..
2.0,This is way too big for my head.
2.0,"Very cute design, but lightweight fabric, much shorter than pictured, and sizing runs very small. I’m 5’4” and it comes mid thigh! Ordered an XL thinking it would give more coverage (usually a L) but my backside shows. It is so darn cute, I wish the fit would have been as shown. I’m giving it to my 5’1” 100 lb daughter."
2.0,Was disappointed in the quality of the blouse. The stitching is flimsy. I will keep it because I like the style.
2.0,Love in cute n all the  con is that  where you fasten it... It came a loose n plus it was to small I has to add extension chain to make it longer.. Imma small  petite lady not small  none am not big
2.0,There where nit clear. I needed them to be clear  or see threw.
2.0,The color of this gopher hat is more red than maroon. Nice quality. My husband liked his gift a lot.
2.0,"Very cute ,but they are small child size. If you are interested for your child then get them, but if you are an adult they may not fit or fit very tight!"
2.0,"Really big, not a fan"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:fadaa5cd620d88fadab8f5e70861ccbf]] Should have sized down. Doesn’t fit right. Returning.
2.0,gave it to a friend who is a 30 waist- these say 32 - all my other 32 shorts/pants are a little big..
2.0,"They ate kind of cheap looking, but for the price they work!"
2.0,Way big.
2.0,Spend a little extra money and purchase a better quality tank top. The seams are uneven and very unflattering!
2.0,Comfort overall good. The dye they used runs. My pillow case was covered in black dye.
2.0,What i received looked nothing like the picture. Very thin and not even close to this color. Very disappointed.
2.0,zipper broke first time used
2.0,Corvette Emblem should be red not orange.  The shirt itself was a nice quality.
2.0,These are super cute and my daughter was looking forward to them for weeks. She received them as a birthday gift and had to put them on immediately. Within two hours she had blisters and circle shaped cuts on her feet. She's worn them so we cannot return (and we aren't the buyer since they were a gift). I have one disappointed child and I expected more from Stride Rite as their other products are wonderful. Not worth the cost.
2.0,Didn't receive the shorts style even tho that's the main reason for ordering it... to late to return as we leave on our trip soon
2.0,When you watch the woman struggle in the video putting it on. Should be a good indication. There are better ones out there. Plus I realized I don’t like the style.
2.0,"I am looking for thick socks for my workouts. These are not thick. Entirely average. I think the industry is saving money by using thin materials, but for whatever reason it is sure difficult to get good socks for workouts now.  I would not buy these again."
2.0,"I love the color of this shoe but they're not very comfortable.  The design of the shoe is pretty but the heel was too high for me.  Plus, they don't have a quiet heel like I like.  They were too loud, clomp."
2.0,All of them are scratched. I’ve ordered from other places and the acrylics always come protected with no scratches but these look awful .
2.0,Way to long. Had to return them.
2.0,"The quality is alright, though no one would call these high quality. They are cute, but they are so big. I got 6-12 months and my 14 month old who wears a size 4 still doesn’t come close to fitting. They are completely soft with no grip on the bottom, so they are unsuitable for my now walking toddler."
2.0,feel lopsided when you wear them  and very stiff
2.0,Very small and not a soft material
2.0,Weird shape.
2.0,"It fit as expected but came with a piece of the plastic underwire poking out. Cute but too much padding. They felt supported, but that wire definitely wasn’t helping. Extra pieces to readjust the bra itself is a great idea."
2.0,not very very cute..
2.0,The large sizes are super small!
2.0,Cheap material. The feel of it is like someone's fingers on a chalkboard. Incredibly small. I am 6ft 2 in 235 and fit like medium
2.0,"I really was looking for cute workout gear. while the size is large enough,  being a 38 dd, this just is not flattering to my body.  I think it would hang better with c cups and below."
2.0,"This would be a beautiful charm if the colors were even a near match to the photo.  The blue is very dark--almost navy blue with very little gleam, even in direct sunlight.  The green is nearly undetectable unless it's closely examined.  When I received the charm it was entirely black with tarnish.  I cleaned it to find the silverwork to be very nicely executed.  Very disappointing about the color.  I do not recommend."
2.0,"Overall not a great experience with this dress. The color isn’t great. Blended in with my skin tone was the first problem. Not flattering. Was extremely hard to get in and out of once it was laced up. You had to lace it up before you put it on which took awhile, but have to make sure it’s loose so you can get it on. No stretch to it at all. Getting it off is pretty impossible unless you completely unlace it or have someone pull it over your head. On top of that the slit openings don’t line up on the bottom. Cheaply made I’m guessing. On top of that it was a mess to return. Was given two different addresses to return to. One in China and one in Oregon. Had to pay to return it, even after I was told with a quality issue it would be a free return. Hard to communicate with. Company doesn’t speak great English. Amazon was able to work with me, which helped. Would not order this dress. Only positive I would say is that it did fit according to the size I ordered how it should. Ordered size 2 and I’m 5’ 6.5” and 120lbs."
2.0,"Looks like something little girls wear, like dress up clothes."
2.0,These would be alright if they were a little bigger. The sizing was smaller than shown.
2.0,Overall very poor quality. Looks very cheap.
2.0,"I gave 2 stars. these turtlenecks are more to use as an undergarments. Its fine for what I needed. The turtlenecks are thin. I did like the stretchy material, the comfort, and sizing. The maroon shirt color is not exactly as pictured. overall, it suits my purposes, but wanted everyone to know what really was delivered."
2.0,"material bueno, talla muy pequeno"
2.0,Recieved
2.0,"Poor quality, hung weird, top was not very long and bottom was too long. Just a strange fit. Fabric was full pleats which is hard to see in the pic. The neck was frayed. Hummm. I sent it back."
2.0,"The color is not as shown in picture, I was expecting a green, it was mor of an aqua color.  It is much shorter than it appeared as well.  I may just give it to one of my teen daughters as a cover up."
2.0,The sleeve sticks out past my shoulders.  It looks really bad.  Very cheaply made.
2.0,Love the look but one of the arms fell off a couple of weeks after buying.
2.0,Can't wear them for more than a few minutes.  The strap hits the top of my foot where it pinches when I walk.  It should be looser and wider.  I have a pair of Spenco Fusion Women's Sandals and they are perfect for wearing in the yard and around the house.  Much better arch support and they don't pinch.
2.0,Order way way up. I got this in a large and needless to say I should have ordered a xxl. This large could have fit my daughter whole normally wears a small. The skirt itself is fine but the waist band is very very very small
2.0,It looks and feels like a swim suit
2.0,These are not flattering on my body at all. They are very baggy
2.0,"This was a gift for my sister.  She loved it and wore it all the time.  In less than half a year, it broke in the fashion that faux leather would.  Do not buy this if you want it to last."
2.0,Had to return it because I couldn't fasten the closure with one hand. But it is very attractive.
2.0,I like the shirt but the sleeves r to small and it's kind of tight and I got a size up than I actrully wear.
2.0,This jacket was thinner than expected.
2.0,"It was cool while it lasted, but the speaker went to crap as of last week. Ordered this for Christmas. Hat runs big and there is a constant blinking blue light on outside of hat while music is being played. A little annoying to others who see it. I guess it works as an indicator that maybe I’m listening to someone/something but then again, how many people know it’s a speaker hat? Wish I was still in the “return window”."
2.0,"I don’t have a big head but these were too small to fit around my head.  The bill was floppy, not stiff and straight like in the picture.  Color was nice, bow detail on back was cute too.  Velcro closure in back, just didn’t fit around my head."
2.0,"Good quality item, however it was too long and tight in the chest all at once. Bummed. If the fit was a little different i probably would've purchased in every color."
2.0,I was so excited to finally get this in the mail to give to my boyfriend (he’s native) but when he opened it the bracelet is bent almost broken and is unwearable. I will be returning this.. super upset.
2.0,"The  grey bra never stayed zipped, the green one will now not stay zipped.  They were purchased a month in advance of my wife's surgery so we were past the the return deadline before we had the no zip issue come up.  Fit is good and comfortable, just will not stay zipped up."
2.0,Poor quality. I will not purchase these again.
2.0,I really liked the belt and wore frequently but unfortunately the metal that joins the buckle to the belt snapped off. And more unfortunately the company wouldn't stand behind their quality and only offered a discount on a future purchase. I'd like to find a belt that will last more than 9 months. The reason I'm vegan is end senseless waste - I don't want to buy a belt every 9 months.
2.0,"This is pretty cheap, and the picture is misleading. The woman in the picture must be wearing an XL for it to be that flowy at the bottom. If you buy your normal size, it will not fit like the picture. I bought my normal size (actually I wear a large or XL normally and I went with the XL, so even a hair bigger) and it fits like a normal shirt- it’s not flowy, just long. Not flattering. I’ll be returning it."
2.0,"I don't know if I just overestimated my measurements and got too large of a size or what! But this dress is hideous!<br />I did not even get to the point of trying it on because as I pulled it out of it's already half-opened bag, it was VERY obvious it had already been worn before. This product was not new.<br />And holding it up, it was shapeless and humongous!<br />I could not figure out HOW to even get it on or how it could possibly look right at all!"
2.0,This specific one is pretty thin (almost see thru) compared to other superhero compression shirts I have ordered.  While the pattern is exactly as pictured it is already fraying on the seams.  Not sure how long it will last after a couple of washes but definitely must air dry I would be afraid to use any dryer setting.
2.0,"Not for someone if you are plus sized. The red color almost emphasizes it. However, the fabric is very nice!"
2.0,Very cute but my navy blue was a foot from the ground instead of being floor length. Other reviews have mixed results. I'm willing to return this one try again with another color. Hopefully they get the length write. I'm only 5'6&#34;!!!
2.0,"The charms are really cute which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1, but the clasp broke after just the 2nd time using it. I will be replacing the clasp because my daughter likes it so much."
2.0,"These were exactly what you would expect when purchasing beads however, the color rubbed off majorly! We all woke up with pink necks and it took several days to completely scrub it all off. I wouldn't recommend only because of this experience."
2.0,When I received my dress it had a slight tear in the side and a mark on it
2.0,Nice tie but definitely not blue and white as advertised.  It's gray.
2.0,"Just got these and only wore once, already wearing out :(  okay fit, nice color but poorly made."
2.0,Cut a size smaller than they are listed.  Disappointed when we got them because not enough time to replace th em.
2.0,"Oh how I really wanted this band to work. I really liked the look of this band. It’s so dainty and pretty looking. Taking a link out was so much easier than other bands I’ve bought and it didn’t require a tool which was a perk. However the biggest downfall was the clasp to open the band to take the watch on and off was awful. If I flexed my wrist in, it’d press on the clasp and pop it open SO easily. I’d be closing it all day if I kept it, or worse, lose the watch! I knew I’d be worried about losing my watch so I sent it right back! I wish the clasp to open and close the watch was the same link style like it is to adjust the band! Then it would have been my favorite band!"
2.0,"ITS OK, WILL WEAR IT"
2.0,"I didn't expect much, but I did expect more for $10. Go to a novelty shop and spend $3. Not even good for a Halloween costume"
2.0,"The picture on the shirt came much bigger and out of focus. It's very thin sweatshirt material, but comfortable and fit are nice."
2.0,They are not self piercing which is why I bought them
2.0,"Kind of disappointed. After the first wash, it lost it's bright pink color, and I used gentle detergent, on a gentle cycle......and it wrinkled terribly- I had to iron twice with starch to make it look decent again."
2.0,It doesn't really hold well and it's made for really small ears and I thought I had small ears. I guess I could make it work but not for a long period of time.
2.0,Very thick material scratchy… Hope it softens up in the wash
2.0,I wanted to love this cuff but it is just too small for my ears
2.0,Awkward cut and material
2.0,"A gift for my mother for Christmas. It's not Christmas yet, but the company keeps writing me to leave a review. Here's your review. The product is still in its package and has the little battery saver tab thing still attached. She hasn't had a chance to use it hey because again, it's not Christmas.<br /><br />Also, the product is smaller than I thought."
2.0,i did not order for that type of watch. NO
2.0,I love these but the little stones are always falling out. Huge disappointment
2.0,Not that I was expecting much for the price but this thing rusted/tarnished really quickly
2.0,"This shirt wasnt what I expected. The color is much lighter than pictured and it was very short, not as pictured."
2.0,"This is a very small Edie purse.  I have 5 other Edie's, I like them because they fit everything I carry but keep them nice and neat, this purse however, is much smaller.  When transferring from one Edie to another, all of my items won't fit.  It is very pretty but had I known it was smaller, I would not have purchased it.  It won't stay closed nor will it fit on my shoulder with a coat on.  I wish I had checked it out when I first purchased it.  It is now too late to return."
2.0,"This dress looks better in the picture. The material is thin. The dress is cut oddly. I followed the manufacturers size chart and ordered a medium, but the dress didn't wrap around like it should have...I could have worn it, probably, as long as the wind didn't blow. Sending it back. Its just not all that great."
2.0,"not as nice as expected. Un hemmed bottom edge, raw fabric edge."
2.0,"This ring is very beautiful, the paw prints are very pristine and the colors are lovely. However, the ring did turn my finger green, so sadly not one that I can wear on a regular basis. I'm very sad about that."
2.0,returned item due to color
2.0,"Returned, I hated the style on me"
2.0,It it very pretty. It fit kinda loose though and threw away the box so could not return it.
2.0,Cute shirt but very poorly sewn together!
2.0,My husband is 6'5&#34; and they are pretty short for him.  Also one of the seams split along the side the first time he wore them.
2.0,I somehow expected this to be a nice material...its parachute-ish and I gave it away.
2.0,"I like the muted colors, but this dress is huge. I am 5’6” and 120 lbs. I got their smallest size - small - and as you can see in the photo, I’m swimming in it. I didn’t want it fitted by any means, but the neckline is droopy, and the arm holes are so big you can see the entire side of my bra.<br />It’s also a little shorter than I would have liked. It’s about 5 inches off the ground when I’m barefoot.<br />This is being returned for sure."
2.0,It's a nice looking purse but it's a thin material and the gold bar on the front came off of mine. I just needed it for the weekend but for the price it's alright. Don't depend on this purse to hold up for a long time.
2.0,"I would not characterize this bra as a &#34;high impact&#34; bra.  Because of the stretchy straps, I still bounced a lot.  Also, there are seams dividing the cup and chestband in half, and they are very uncomfortable.  I've never had another bra that had seams over the underwire and band.  Whoever designed it that way gets an &#34;F&#34;.  I would return this bra if I hadn't already washed it."
2.0,"The sleeves were baggier and longer than the pictures. This shirt did not flatter my curvy body and made me look very boxy. I would imagine on someone with a smaller frame, this top would work better for them. The material was thin and nice for summer weather."
2.0,I liked the material. The only thing I didn’t like was when I held it up the light it was see through. I will be returning it.<br />Other than that it would have worked great for my wedding day.
2.0,Runs small for large breasted women.
2.0,TOO LITTLE
2.0,"My sister and I were traveling on the train for three days.  She recommended we buy your socks to improve comfort while sleeping on the train.  However, they were so tight that I could not even pull them on--let alone sleep in them.  They were awful."
2.0,"These glasses were meant for a Halloween costume, but they were severely bent. I believe  it was in production as the box was sufficiently packed and even if it was jostled around, it would have been fine since they were folded up, but when I went to put them all they were bent to hell."
2.0,After a while of wearing the jacket it just shuts off. And we can’t figure out how to get it on. The instructions are not very clear at all.
2.0,Absolutely adorable but I will never be able to wear because it is completely see-through. Don’t buy the orange one 🙄😩
2.0,"I bought this to tie-dye for my daughter because it says it's 95 percent cotton. This must be completely wrong. I dyed it and the only thing that kept the dye was the lace. This may need to be updated. Also, the size runs pretty small and even though I ordered a large size she will only be able to wear for a short time."
2.0,"The suspenders have the usual very cheap fake leather button connectors. These will rip out in no time. I have had new real heavy leather connectors made at a shoe repair shop. Now I know these will last longer then these suspenders. Good suspenders should have quality leather button connectors, and these do not."
2.0,The band itself is very nice but the metal clasp that connects to the watch is very weak. After a month or so of normal wearing the metal broke apart and can’t be reconnected. If they used a more sturdy metal to connect to the watch this would be a 5 star review. I give it 2 stars rather than 1 because the band itself is nice.
2.0,The picture look better than the outfit does.
2.0,I was only able to west one of them because the stitching was bothering my finger on the other one. It lasted a week
2.0,I love this necklace but it tarnished quickly
2.0,"Too small, hard to pull on. Fingers too long.  Sent to an old address, so delayed delivery.  I will return."
2.0,"These were a gift, and although they are nice leather boots, they’re very thin! So I am returning them"
2.0,These socks are not thick. I was terribly disappointed.
2.0,"fit great but the pads move around after first wash, and its very hard to get them back in place"
2.0,"I consider myself a decent snowboarder I go anywhere from 3-20 times a winter and I own expensive name brand goggles so maybe I am comparing this to those too much but I am very disappointed in these goggles.<br /><br />The packaging, manual, cloth sack, and lens cloth are surprisingly nice. Unfortunately, that is where the quality seems to end.<br />The actual lens itself feels sturdy and looks nice, however, the frame doesn't look great and feels cheap, and the foam isn't what I would even consider to be foam. Furthermore, the strap is too thin and doesn't feel like it would stay on my head for very long.<br /><br />Due to the price point of these goggles I would actually be completely willing to look past that, until I put them on my face. They aren't round enough, or flexible enough to form around my face, and they sit WAY too high. To get them to fit on top of my nose, I am basically looking at the bottom foam. I would say that maybe this is just the shape of my face but I have owned many goggles and never had any issue like this before. Also my girlfriend tried them on and said the same thing.<br /><br />I have not been able to test these at the mountain yet so I cannot comment on the fog-proof lens.<br /><br />All in all I got these because of the price in case I need another spare or something, however I don't think I will even try to take them as it would ruin my experience if I had to use them."
2.0,Looks like the real thing and feels good. The white bands were broken on mine so I could not use. Wish there was a way to return the broken ones and exchange them while keeping the good ones.
2.0,Very thin. I expected a thicker polo shirt type of material. This shirt will lose its shape quickly and wrinkles easily. I sent it back.
2.0,"These masks are very cute and look as expected. However, they are much larger than expected, they cover my face over my eyes down to my neck. The material is thick and rough causing itchiness."
2.0,"Did not feel comfortable and didn't seem to help with the heel pain for Plantar Fasciitis.  Arch support was ok, but pain persisted."
2.0,Sizing is just not compatible with US sizing.  Hard to make accurate purchases.  Had to return.
2.0,I was expecting these to be a cotton shirt like most pullovers but it is has a feel of a cheap plastic.  I bought multiple patterns and they are all the same.  I may be returning.  Not at all what I expected.
2.0,bought for granddaughter  and she can't wear it
2.0,Don't buy these if you think you can squeeze them to make them larger or smaller. They are very hard material. I bought six of them for my friends. Everyone is a little different size and I thought we could just adjust as needed. Unfortunately that did not work out. I wrote to the seller when I got them to tell them that. I never had any response. My friends all kept them. But only a couple can actually wear them.
2.0,I ordered because I like the oversized look but the frame was too large for my head. They fell right off.
2.0,"After slipping these on I have discovered my glasses and my head are too small for these.  I can't get the little ""horn""like [pieces ot lay comfortably and every time I take them off they pull my hair.  I""ll have to try something else."
2.0,Go up a size if your purchasing.  The fabric seems of low quality prone to pilling and will not sustain wear
2.0,The loops don't stay on your feet well and end up around your ankle. Also the metal length adjuster pulls the hell out of my leg hair!
2.0,Love this outfit and purchased in two colors before I realized there were no snaps to change the diaper. You have to take off the entire outfit just to change a diaper which is annoying and frustrating and a huge setback of an otherwise adorable outfit. I also felt it rode up on my daughter and was a little small.
2.0,"It is not comfortable at all, padding runs down when wearing it- needs to be pulled over and over again. Not recommended at all."
2.0,"This piece looks nice, but my wife and I were very disappointed with her gift.  There is absolutely NO FROSTING as in the picture on the website, which highlights the Dragon’s face and would make the piece acceptable. Additionally, we do not believe that this piece is made of Obsidian. It looks and feels like plastic. There is no weight when compared with other pieces of equal size we KNOW are Obsidian.<br />Can you please replace this piece with one that looks like the one on Amazon’s website?<br />Thank you,"
2.0,"very circular in shape, doesn't bend to accommodate a different ear shape. when i tried to reshape it (gently), it broke."
2.0,The ratings butterfly
2.0,"I usually wear a 2X so I ordered a 4X. Belt did not come close to fastening, perhaps wrong belt. Waist fitted just below breast, as if empire waist. Dress is lovely. Wish it fit better. Their customer service is wonderful. I just wish the sizing was more realistic."
2.0,"this dress was beautiful on the top, but the sleep was to tight and the bottom of the dress color look off the color did not look royal blue, it look like gray blue not a good look at all  did not look like the book at all."
2.0,"These are very pretty earrings, however one of them was bent and when I tried to straighten it out a piece broke off.<br />Luckily, I have a friend that repairs jewelry and may be able to fix it.<br />Update, she couldn't fix it, the solder won't not adhere, so I'm looking for another hoop to at least put the circle part on."
2.0,"Material is fine. Seams are good. Totally different color than expected. Not at all like the description photo. Pretty frumpy fit. I’m a thin person and the way it lays just seems bulky. Pockets are great! Overall, returned."
2.0,Da comezón y se decolora lo metalico
2.0,"It's a cute, flowy spring wrap, but the quality is pretty bad. Mine held up for 3 wears and then the stitching at the sleeves came undone."
2.0,"Top cup of conopy was detached on of of ribs, on picture two ribs site by site."
2.0,I inquired if the pearls are ROUND and was told “it is round. “ But tell me how could you call those ROUND?! They are off-round at most. One of them even chipped! Very disappointed! I’ll probably return it. Very dishonest seller!
2.0,"The picture is very misleading. The material is cheesy, and the colors (particularly the orange) is loud."
2.0,"This review stated would hold money n credit cards,,,u need to fold money 3 ways to use this wallet.it is nice quality but makes money to bulky,I returned it.."
2.0,"Did not like the way it looked, especially around the collar. Material was also a bit cheap and itchy. Into the donation bag it went."
2.0,Poor quality. Worn once and the straps are fraying. Sizing closer to 10 than 12.
2.0,Material is not cotton
2.0,The side straps are just glued between the padding and the rubber and felt when walking. The zipper gets stuck when trying to put them on. On top of being far to large they are just poorly made.
2.0,"After more carefully reviewing the stated description (my fault), I should not have purchased this case. I have since returned it. Calling it a 100 pen case is misleading because, while it will hold 100 loose pens no problem, the idea of the elastic dividers holding each pen individually is what most people (my opinion) are thinking when they read the headline. I like Kipling stuff in general, so this seems like an odd product that could have been more clearly advertised. Again, I should have read the description more carefully."
2.0,Shirt size ran small.
2.0,aunque muy lento el envio pero estoy conforme con el articulo
2.0,I bought a 2X and the size I received would fit a small! The quality isn't bad though (not like a cotton T-shirt but I personally liked that!).
2.0,"the red lenses looks like something was melt on it, im pretty disapointed because the red lenses werent in good shape"
2.0,I love the style. My only reason for a 2 star review is that half the chain just fell off. It fell off in the package before I could even open it.
2.0,It was pretty and the fit was good. The seam of the dress ran down the middle of the dress. It didn’t look right.
2.0,I got the size that I typically wear and from looking at the picture I thought it would be a loose fit but it was really snug and much shorter than I expected.
2.0,"When I first got this, it was a dress, long enough to hot have to wear anything under it. I washed it 3 days ago and am just now wearing it again and it has shrunk down to a long shirt. It has shrunk 3 sizes down and I am not happy. So, if you want it to stay the same size, don't ever wash it."
2.0,There was nothing special about these earnings. There were huge and cheaply made. You get what you paid for I guess.
2.0,I received this product today and there is a rip in the seam of one of the pant legs. Very soft and comfortable. Want to give it 5 stars but it came damaged.
2.0,Disappointed that there isn't any text on the shirt I received.  It is completely washed out or misprinted.  I do love the Yorkie picture so it isn't a complete loss.
2.0,FREYING IN 4 WASHES.  NOT HAPPY WITH THE  POOR MATERIAL QUALITY.  PASSED RETURN DATE.  BUYER BEWARE.
2.0,"Item didn’t even work. Replaced batteries thinking they just weren’t any good, item still doesn’t work. Little disappointing."
2.0,So this is a cotton-like printed top and bottom.. not a soft knit like shown in the pictures!! Not what I expected.. in a bad way... disappointed in this product!
2.0,These are not made got petite girls-donor get them if you are short
2.0,"Poor quality hoop material, can feel a rough seam around the hoop. Fine for a fun, trendy purchase but not great quality."
2.0,Nice looking but very weak material. Bought 2 of these. The first one turned yellow in the wash. Tried to clean but it got worse. Liked the shirt so I bought a second one and it had a hole in the shoulder before I even wore it. Disappointed in the material.
2.0,Wasn't what I thought it was from the picture.
2.0,the spikes fell off all the time.
2.0,These are to wide. Her poor little foot slides out the front of the shoe.
2.0,Very pretty but the clasp broke after less than a week.
2.0,"Couple problems with this dress: the fit was COMPLETELY off. The skirt fit ok, but the bust was too large by 3-4&#34; at least.<br />Additionally, the fabric is rough and stiff and feels terrible against your skin.<br />Not sure if buying a medium would fix the fit issues, but I'm not willing to exchange because the fabric is just not comfortable to be in."
2.0,"I bought an X-large and as I am checking the title again this is supposed to be women's clothing; however, it was way too small.  I gave them to my 13-year-old.  NOT HAPPY at all........."
2.0,Zipper broke after 2 weeks and a snap ripped through fabric just recently. OVERALL THIS JACKET IS TRASH
2.0,These were too small for my son who was 5 feet 10 inches (he is 6ft now) .
2.0,"I expected this to be a cotton tee but it is a synthetic and the black is more of a dark blue.  So disappointed, this is going right back."
2.0,With the Fitbit one on your wrist it over calculates your steps
2.0,Very bad smell
2.0,Definitely is not true to size. I bought a size larger based on prior reviews and it’s still too small
2.0,"Base broke off with less than a week of use. Horribly constructed. You would think they would at least have designed it so that the base and top would snap together. After all, its a keychain, not a christmas ornament. Without glue, the base will not even hold on. Shame because my gf really liked it."
2.0,It looks great for the price online...but when it arrived...its def you pay for what you get. Its not velvet material so really disappointed. It is thinly made and the breast area fit a child then they would with women small with a biggest bust line.....<br />Overall good for a teenager or lounge at home.
2.0,"The shoes themselves are comfortable, but with every step there is loud creaking and squeaking sounds coming from the soles of these shoes. And it only gets worse each day. This is a huge disappointment considering what these shoes cost. I would expect this from a discount 20 dollar shoe, but not 70. I would not recommend these.."
2.0,"Easily breaks. This is not a strong, durable product. It is fragile. It will break with very little effort. You cannot repair it with standard eyeglass repair kits. Waste of money."
2.0,"These pants are not at all flattering. If you have any kind of butt, these pants will press it down all weird and flat. The pants are also tight in weird places and loose in others, creating a weird lumpy look to your body. I'm really disappointed in these pants. Another annoying thing was that they had fake pockets. I hate fake pockets.<br />One upside, if you wear them with a giant shirt that will cover down to the tops of your thighs, and completely covers your butt, they're almost cute with the right boots.<br />I was planning to buy multiple pairs of these till I got them. So glad I didn't do it in advance."
2.0,"Quality is nice, thick enough material, the front tie is much smaller than picture. Specially on the 2xl, looks like the width didnt increase"
2.0,Clasp would not open.  YouTube videos and response from company but they did not help.
2.0,Loved them but after only wearing once one of the screws came out
2.0,Wont' fit a man's wrist unless you have wrists like a kid
2.0,The black facemask was a different pattern than pictured. The other 2 masks were great. Gave it 2 stars because one mask wasn't as pictured.
2.0,Was stained when opened. Returned it and got one from a different company.
2.0,"Decent product BUT, considering these aren't the cheapest socks, I was disappointed to find a pair of them missing from my order. Other than that, the socks fit and arrived on time."
2.0,It’s a very cute dress but not remotely as long as the picture. My daughter is 7 but based on reviews I bought her a 10- dress still comes up 3” above ankles. So not a real maxi dress. Disappointed...
2.0,I wore 1 time & it broke
2.0,"I really really wanted this set to work. I wanted something comfortable, but sweet and flirty. Instead I feel like I’m wearing a diaper. The material is soft and stretchy, so it’s conventionally “comfortable” until the shorts start riding up your ass and it feels like you’re wearing a pull-up. Not curvy girl approved."
2.0,"I'm 115lbs, 5'7 and this dress in a Large (which was suggest to fit an X-small) is HUGE on me. I have to almost tie it behind me to get it to fit. The arms are very loose and the entire dress is unlined, which means it's 100% see-through in the sun (or even in normal light).  It's cute, but I'd say a Large would fit a S/M, not an XS or straight small (unless you have a B cup or larger). And be warned that you'll need a bodycon slip or something underneath."
2.0,When I initially saw these I though they set perfect until they came in they are extremely cheap are very yellow they are not good at all
2.0,Ordered a 2x (I’m 5’7” 190lbs) pants fit well but the top is wayyyy too small . Like a crop top . Disappointed. I was so excited. Glad I didn’t order all the colors I wanted right away 😩
2.0,I ordered these in the grey and when they arrived they were brown.  Other than that I love them
2.0,"If you want to buy this,  I'm 5'2&#34;, 118 lbs, 34 C, 25 inch waist and this fits nice and snug. However, after two times wearing it it's doing that thing where the fabric gets little fuzzy balls all over it.  I didn't even put it in the dryer! It now looks like velcro and any tiny piece of lint or hair sticks to it."
2.0,"The workmanship is pretty poor.  I didn't expect much at this price.  The lining only goes to the knee on the skirt.  The zipper was not put in correctly, it stops four inches to short in the skirt."
2.0,La tela es de mala calidad.
2.0,Not for all day use. The mask is sturdy and comfortable. The material makes it easy to clean. However this is not for all day use as it makes your face sweat.
2.0,My legs were black from the shoes
2.0,The painting of the earrings was not complete. You could see the wood through the paint.
2.0,Looks cheap..much more than expected.
2.0,"We're the perfect size, not too big or too small. But I received them in terrible condition. The earrings were tarnished so that you could see the metal, and some of the stones on one of the earrings were not even set and were glued to the border. I don;t know if I just got a bad set or what but I will buy from someone else next time"
2.0,"I am not a fan of the fabric. Feels more and looks almost like athletic wear.. much like under Armour not at all like what I was expecting or hoping for... Definitely not flattering for a curvy girl... it clung to my body and I bought a large.. should have looked the reviews.. and the color was not as pictured. I was excited it looked cute, but not on me."
2.0,Not very attractive. The seam on the edges of the fabric is pretty unsightly as well. I doubt I will ever wear these in public.
2.0,this bag looks like the one i wanted - on steroids.much larger than i expected - Great looking bag but will never use this size.
2.0,very tight and short
2.0,"Idea was good but cheaply made for the price, the wood used for the pendant is ridiculously light, wood used for toothpicks has more density than this... My son could've made this for me for a fraction of the price! Won't wear it for fear that the beads might pop which is another thing so I guess it'll just be an ornament for my desk."
2.0,I liked the concept and needed some extra drink storage for my boat.  The Amazon product image was a pencil sketch and seemed ok.  When the product arrived and I saw what it looked like for the first time I regretted buying it.  It's very cheap looking and very basic.  I expected a much better product based on the price.  I was going to order two and give one as a gift but I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />The two drink holders are different sizes.  One will hold a typical canned drink and the other is slimmer and will hold a narrow bottle.  There are slots for fishing tools but tools restrict access to the drinks especially when mounted on a seat pedestal.
2.0,it’s so cute! but i’m 5’2 and i weigh 110 pounds i got a small and it’s huge! I’m to short and small for it :(
2.0,"Really well made item, very good looking too.  So why 2 stars?  Well, the edges are really pointy and sharp.  I affixed this keychain to my purse for decoration and it proceeded to get caught on everything.  It ruined a pair of leggings, but I just chalked that up to my own carelessness.  It met it's demise when I crouched down to look at something on the bottom shelf at a department store and it caught itself on the lip of the shelf without me realizing.  When I stood up, it snapped, detaching from the chain, leaving the ring behind of my purse, and the warglaives nestled under the shelf."
2.0,"I almost canceled twice because it took much longer to arrive than initially promised. Then, when it came, the gaiter is so big and the fabric is so slippery that neither my husband or I could get it to stay up over our nose. Not much use if it keeps falling down. Overall I'm disappointed with the purchase."
2.0,I have a small head so I was ecstatic to find this in a small.  Should have known it was too good to be true. The hat fit but the upper part kinda of buckled inwards so it made me look like a pointy headed weirdo.  The quality seemed good but this is just not my hat.  I don't think it was me entirely.  I think the cut is just kind of off or maybe I received one that was defective.  I'm not going to bother with another size though in case it is just me.
2.0,"Sizing is correct per info provided- maybe could have sized down even, because the fabric is very stretchy... And shiny.  Very, cheaply shiny. Not sheer, just a shiny polyester that no one likes. The photo shows a far more matte fabric- folks, that nice matte finish you see in the image isn't what you get.  Pockets, yes. Pleats... maybe you could call it that, but certainly not flattering.  There is a monotone 'hem' or detailing around the asymmetric bottom of the skirt, and that's a nice detail, but nothing is going to save the skirt from this fabric.  Sadly, this one had promise but is destroyed by the fabric itself.  I couldn't recommend it.  2 stars because it otherwise looks like the image, arrived on time and is sized properly according to the info provided."
2.0,Not true to size. Order a size larger. Cute style though.
2.0,These are comfortable shoes but a bit heavy too. The problem I have with these is that my feet sweat in this so much . Also the fake leather starts to smell the moment you get it wet
2.0,"I just received these yesterday.  I was a little worried about the price/quality of these cufflinks because there were no reviews, but after seeing them in person, I am very pleased. The cufflinks feel solid, and have some weight to them. The weight might be annoying to some people though.<br /><br />It took a little over 2 weeks to be delivered to New York.<br /><br />Update - 5/21:<br />I've worn these cufflinks 8-9 times with no issues, but when I went to put them on today, I noticed that one of the cufflinks is starting to fall apart.  The gold colored insert has detached from the casing.  The only thing keeping it from falling out completely is the winder.  This is unacceptable for cufflinks that cost $70."
2.0,"Super long, not the legth shown in picture"
2.0,"The images a very misleading. Looks more like a tiny bottle of salt. Does glow in the dark, but not blue like the images would have you think.<br /><br />It's neat, but not as advertised."
2.0,Made for a short person. I found them a different home.
2.0,"Hight-quailty, responsibility priced. Purchased as a gift and the person who received it was impressed by the design, multiple storage options, and multiple carrying options. Fit a 17&#34; HP laptop nicely.<br /><br />Updated 2/20/18 - gave as a Christmas gift and today the shoulder strap clip broke."
2.0,Wouldn't have gotten them if I knew they were so tiny. They are more for a child.
2.0,"We received this item in exchange for an honest review.  I ordered my typical size for fitted shirt 18x36 and this was far too tight.  I would say that slim fit is very accurate and if you are indeed slim this might work well for you... I normally wear an athletic fit and this was too tight to even fully button up all the way.  Again, if you are buying for a slim fellow the quality of the shirt seemed nice, just didn't work for me."
2.0,"Very small leg holes. No protection if period pad leaks in the front. Runs very small. 4x is fits like a small size 8. The legs holes are misplaced somehow, like seem fine then become very uncomfortable very fast."
2.0,"Order a larger size for length if you are taller.  I'm 5'9"".  Apple body type beware.  This may make you look boxy."
2.0,"This ankle bracelet was just what I wanted. It fit well, looked great, but snapped in half after wearing twice."
2.0,"When I received it I noticed that the straps were stitched in front of the mag pouches, rather than behind. This makes it difficult to retrieve and re-index magazines easily. Overall it seems to be of good construction, the Velcro is very strong. I wish the shoulder straps had some elasticity to them."
2.0,"Maybe I have a narrow head but these are really big and large gaps everywhere. I could have tightened the ear loops and sewn them but with 5 masks, that's not what I want to do. Plus I'd need to sew in multiple places if I even did that. They seem to breathe well and the fabric is soft where I wish they fit me better. The design is also bold and great coloring."
2.0,Too big. The front was too long. I had to give away.
2.0,I am sending back the watch due to the band set up .. the adjustment to set the size will not hold its setting.. tried multiple times but no luck.. I would keep the watch if the band would set...
2.0,Very cool but too tight  Had to return
2.0,"The fit was a bit odd, they kinda ride/slip upwards if your waist tappers in at all. But the real disappointment was that they ripped in the first week of owning them “/ the fabric isn’t the highest quality but the rip happened on a seam where there’s no strain - so odd."
2.0,Got two left shooting star earrings. Ugh. No I didn’t send it back at was a highly discounted set and it would cost me more in gas to package it up and take it somewhere to be sent back.
2.0,"Very very cheap fabric,  not flattering at all"
2.0,pattern only one side !
2.0,Surgical steel and I'm still allergic to it?? Something doesn't seem right here. Ears were so itchy after just one hour of wear
2.0,"Not nearly as 'slouchy' as picture indicates.  Fits much more like a regular stocking cap.  It's not so tight that it's constricting, it's just not ample or elongated as in the picture."
2.0,Liked the pattern of the kimono. Ordered an X-Large as it goes over other clothing and wanted some flow to the garment. Tried it on as soon as it was delivered and disappointed set in. Sizing felt like it was a size medium-large.
2.0,"For what this item is, the price is way to high. Not worth the price"
2.0,"I took a risk ordering these shorts since there was only one review and it was one star. These shorts are 5&#34; and even though I ordered xxl, the size was like xl.<br />Hopefully they'll let me return these."
2.0,I return it.
2.0,way too small - almost kid size! quality of the fabric was not good. I didn't return in time so looks like I inherited one camo tank from my hubbys closet.. he's an XXL - Im a woman's medium and his &#34;XXL&#34; fits ME like a woman's top!! WAY WAY SMALL.
2.0,"Ordered XL. Was plenty wide in the body, but the sleeves were way too short. As if it was a petite size arm length.  Plus arms were narrow., especially for an XL  Heavy weight. Heavier than I expected.  Fit with the snaps was kinda weird.  Returned."
2.0,Too thin<br />Not what I expected based on the picture
2.0,I was very excited to receive my package today but unfortunately I pushed the button and they flashed once and died.
2.0,Looks cheap on. Not really what I thought it would look like on. It a bit boxy looking and the arms holes were snug. I may wear this as a workout top after all.  A few snips and adjustments may need to be made though.
2.0,It’s more pink than tan. Very wrinkled as well.
2.0,Strap was good but the watch cover had the holes in the wrong place so i couldnt use it
2.0,So the shirt is cute but I ordered a 2x in women's & it's super small. I gave it to my preteen daughter who wears a small-medium in juniors & it fit her perfectly.
2.0,"The tutu is very cute and fit pretty well; however, the shirt was awful. The words are not printed on, they are embroidered, and the backing on the inside of the shirt is very scratchy and rough. My daughter wore it for about 10 minutes and then begged me to take if off of her. It left red marks on her chest and stomach. Unfortunately, an undershirt isn't a great option because the fabric is pretty thin and slightly see-through, so the shirt was unwearable. I returned this outfit."
2.0,Had them for two weeks and they are already spliting in crush area
2.0,"Umbrella is nice. Solar panel arrived shattered. Contacted seller, who said they would ship a new one and never saw it arrive."
2.0,"Was not the correct item. It was the same style/brand but instead of a bodysuit it was a two-piece bra and thong set. It fit, but wasn’t very flattering so I definitely would have preferred receiving the correct one - the bodysuit style that is actually pictured."
2.0,"The pants run very small, I ordered an XLR and the size fits all medium small frame person."
2.0,I liked the style but i wear a 10 1/2 and I ordered a size 11 a size 12 might have still been tight! I even used the size chart! Order a size larger!
2.0,These pants are made well. Except for the sizing is messed up.<br />I have a 29 inch waist and 40 inch hips.<br />So I went for the large thinking it would be a baggier fit (like it hangs on the model)<br />I got these because they had nice big pockets and looked comfy.<br />But they are so tight I can't even use the pockets and I can barely move my legs.<br />If you're a woman who has curves go up two sizes.
2.0,"It was a nice jersey knit dress that fit well in the waist but the chest, arms and back were a bit too snug to look good. I usually wear a US size 12 blouse(Large) and 8-9 pants(Medium). I ordered this in large and ended up returning it. Unless a person is a petite build, I recommend ordering 1-2 sizes up."
2.0,Soft and cozy but not even close to knee high!  Petty much normal sock length-
2.0,They work great for about 1 month then the lace snaps.. Happened about 3 times now. I've never replaced laces this fast.  Have them on a set of derby shoes and no roughing around. The laces seem to be of a softer cloth and less durable. The thickness and length is great but them breaking so often is irritating.
2.0,"Cute, but pretty skimpy on the material. Is what it is for the price."
2.0,"While the print is cute and I was getting compliments all day (although I don't quite know what fireworks have to do with Christmas...This dress has several shortcomings. The Fabric itself is comfortable, but too thin (since I got the cream color Christmas theme) you could see EVERYTHING underneath. I had to change into white everything underneath. (white bra, white camisole...which is weird for wearing a dress btw, white panties, and a white slip.) Since I had to wear a slip I was constantly having to adjust and smooth it out so I didn't have big creases and folds. I work in an office and am having to get up many many times in just a short period...making for a lot of awkward pulling and tugging.<br />The fit is perfect up top...but a little small in the waist area....I am not large, I am average build....but I do tend to hold my weight in that area....making it slightly unflattering. Soooo, I had to break out the SPANX....nobody likes having to wear those ALL DAY.<br />While I was able to overcome the shortcomings....It took just a little too much effort than I like. (as a momma of a three year old...and a husband that isn't home in the mornings, getting ready in the morning is difficult enough as it is.) Between the camisole, the spanx, and the slip....it was just too inconvenient for me."
2.0,"more like pajama's, than an outfit you would wear out."
2.0,Arms are alittle small
2.0,Its very convenient light weight and comfy just the right amount of room for breathing.
2.0,La billetera tiene un tamaño y bolumen que no es el que esperaba.
2.0,Fastener is too long catches on my clothing or comes loose.  Not a good fit keeps watch sliding around on my wrist.
2.0,"Bought this shawl for my wife and had to buy it 2 sizes larger then what she normally wears due to what I would assume is considered Asian sizing and when we received it one of the sleeves was not hemmed, leaving just the raw edge of the material.  Over all the quality of the shawl was poor."
2.0,Color is nice but these are very thin.
2.0,Not bright white. Sort of yellow tinged
2.0,WAY too stiff.  I gave it away.  Bought stuff something else.
2.0,These masks are small and the elastic that goes around your ears is hurting my ears after a while because the elastic is to thick. Won't buy again.
2.0,Pretty short for crew length.  One of the socks had a hole after 2 wearings.  Like the colors.
2.0,They break really easy.
2.0,"Fit great on the bottom half, Way to tight on top, neck opening too small."
2.0,Ordered the toddler glasses but they are way too big and too loose to stay on his face.  They are more like teen or small adult size
2.0,"The color is great. But the sizes are not good at all. Will be returning soon. The shirt on top of being somewhat small it’s also shaped weird. Does not all full range of motion.<br /><br />Now the bottoms are the exact opposite. The waist is somewhat large but they’re extremely long and loose around the leg<br /><br />For reference, i bought the xxl size . I’m 5’9” 270lbs I normally wear XXL t shirts and 40x30 jeans"
2.0,Not long enough and small in the thigh area.
2.0,"These briefs are very comfortable but the legs are too short. This causes your ""junk"" to hang out. I bought eight pair and returned seven of them. The mid-thigh brief is much better and I ordered ten pair. They are wonderful."
2.0,This dress runs about a size small and the quality is very poor! The zipper ripped when trying it on the first time
2.0,I loved the style but it said Large but it was way too big for me
2.0,Cute earrings. A little large and also the backs do not fit on properly. I had to find all my own backs to use because the ones sent just slip right off. I would've sent this back if it wasn't such a hassle. They are pretty cute though
2.0,Nice but looks cheap
2.0,Broken very easily on pups collar.
2.0,Frames broke while on vacation trying to use this product
2.0,"While the fit is accurate, the texture of the shirt is not pleasant. The print was alright."
2.0,Ripped in back after three months :(
2.0,Pretty disappointed that the ink faded after only one wash. I doubt I'll be wearing this after a few more washes.
2.0,The tie is good quality but it does not remotely match the photo.<br />Was counting on this for groomsmen and the description/photo was not accurate.<br />Not even the name is the same as the product listed here.<br /><br />Look up &#34;Well disguised stripe&#34; on tiebar.com to see accurate tie description
2.0,Product was to be grey. It is not. It is a lavender/purple  color.
2.0,"Shoes are adorable but 2-3 sizes too small relative to all the other similar style shoes.  Also no velcro, but a plastic snap which is difficult for my toddler to close without help."
2.0,Not what I expected. The material is not what I imagined.
2.0,"I looked at the pic and thought maybe they were for curvier girls, but then I went through the description and that was not noted anywhere. It said true to size but I can assure you they weren’t even close to fitting. It was comical. I returned them."
2.0,"Super super cute BUT if you have a long torso don't even try it. Completely rode up me ""down"" there."
2.0,I wanted to like these. They’re dainty looking and I got them because this has been my mantra lately. However the one side of the chain looks cheap.  It also runs on the small side so I had to use the full extension. Took forever to arrive and not worth sending back. Wore mine for awhile but that’s it
2.0,"I loved the look of this corset top - the gold patterned material with the plain black inserts - AND the fact that it had shoulder straps, in case the bust ended up being a bit too large across the top, which I find happens too often with these no-name corset tops. But when it arrived, I could tell before even opening the package it was going right back. The fabric of the straps was so thin it the straps twisted & wouldn’t lie flat; and there were loose threads sticking out in several places all over the garment. It was a REAL disappointment - not a garment I’d recommend to anyone."
2.0,This shirt is quite ugly in person. Really disappointed! Returning. Its reminds me of a football jersey.
2.0,"Difficult to put on, doesn’t stay on"
2.0,Fits well. Sequin stripes are very poorly made. There is a black mesh showing from underneath and the sequins were already starting to fall off when I took it out of the box. Do NOT waste your $$.
2.0,"Bought same brand at Sams with no issues. However, this box has a lot of elastic bands detaching from mask."
2.0,One of the earrings came broken.
2.0,"I think the quality could be way better, I don’t want to spend any amount of money on something that immediately falls apart."
2.0,"The fabric color and pattern is beautiful, but the strap rope knot on the inside is huge and ugly.  Sent it back."
2.0,"I liked the pattern and thought it would be a good spring dress to wear to church for Easter based on the pictures. The fabric was not see through which I see with a lot of dresses sold online in my size. Plus the fabric was soft and the dress had pockets. However, there was more bad than good.<br /><br />The bad was the fit. It was too loose in the armpit area and there was a weird ruching thing going on. That's the main reason the dress is being sent back. I wouldn't feel good about myself wearing a dress like that in public because even if other people don't notice it, I do. I honestly don't think this issue can be solved by buying a size up or down.<br /><br />Part of the issue may be occuring because of my height. I'm 5' 2.5"". If this company offered dresses in petite sizes maybe I wouldn't have this problem."
2.0,Very thin and fit a little snug.  I really don't think these will last too long. It does take forever to receive them from China; about a month.
2.0,Cheap fabric.. faded a lot in the wash
2.0,didn't look the picture
2.0,Ordered these boxers because my husband likes longer legged boxers.  We took the boxers out of packaging and held them up and the legs were to short. In description it said 6 inches.  Maybe 3 inches not 6. Sent them back
2.0,[[VIDEOID:95ad8d38a2b0179f1ddbafe140689eda]] I ordered these socks due to a large number of good views and the variations in color options. My feet are on the smaller size (women size 6) and the socks are way too big in the foot.  While these might be nice for those in mid-range (seems more like a 7/8 women's size socks) they are certainly too big for a 6 and too small for a 9. Considering returning them at this time looking for other socks to purchase within the 10-20 dollar range. Very soft socks but too big and likely to return.
2.0,This item is not what I expected (material is not sweat shirt material). I thought it could be used to layer for warmth.
2.0,"Item not as advertised. I purchased one of these belts about five years ago; the buckle was metal, gunmetal. The one I received today has a plastic buckle. The buckle is formed the same, looks the same, but it is plastic."
2.0,"Sooo I thought I would love this dress, I really did. The fit was okay, but I have ordered AX Paris dresses that have fit a bit better, the hips just seem to have been cut a bit wider than some other styles (and this is the usual style I order from AX Paris as I am curvy). I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and ordered up; normally I am an 8-10, and 36DDD and I ordered a 12, but it was way too big in the hips. It fit across the chest but was a bit tight in the arms of all places, which was a first, since that's the one part of me that is NOT large. I don't know if I got a strangely cut dress or what. But the reason I returned the dress was actually not the fit...I returned it because I ordered the navy with the yellow flowers, and the fabric in the photo is beautiful (and it is in person as well)...but when I put the dress on, the LARGEST flower on the dress was right on my, well my lady part. I mean really? No one though to check where that would end up when one put the dress on? I looked like a rejected Georgia O'Keefe painting! So not okay on so many levels. So back it goes, and will not be ordering this style again. For those that do order this one in navy with yellow flowers, good luck on the fit and may your flowers be well placed!"
2.0,"This bag fell apart within 3 months-it was great, till it wasn’t. Don’t waste your money!"
2.0,The shirts ae by far no where close to a true fit. I could hardly get it on. I have worn long sleeve shirts before and this shirt is on unbelievably tight for a xxl size.
2.0,Red one came broken
2.0,Arms and bust area tight
2.0,"This band looks and feels great, and that's about it.  The screws that hold it together fall out (if you tighten screws too tight the band doesn't fit or click in right) because you need it to be flexible to snap in.  After daily use I lose screws and the springs that hold it firmly together.  There are not many options out there so I bought a second one and placed a drop of super glue on the screws to hold them in place but I'm not sure if that's ideal.  I'm going to try to return the defective one because it's shouldn't do that or I shouldn't have to super glue the screws to be safe.<br />Oh, because the screws didn't hold my watch went flying off my wrist hit the ground and I had to file a insurance claim on the watch because it hit the ground so hard it wouldn't charge and the bevel turned but not very easy.  Use with extreme caution."
2.0,"The medallion is great, but, the rope closure needs improvement, hard to close and open."
2.0,Top fit perfectly. The bottoms were too tight in the waist so much that they were uncomfortable.
2.0,I loved the chunkier look of these and the bigger/wider toe box. But the insoles were rock hard and the boot overall felt narrow. Returned them.
2.0,The dress is made from a stretchy material but the dress looked like a poka dot dress. Not very pleased that is wasn't was I expected.
2.0,These wipe off fine but they are very small. My mom is about 5'6 and 120 pounds and these are quite narrow and short on her. Will not purchase again. Her wheelchair seat was covered in food as was her lap.
2.0,Cute bag but it needs something to keep the bottom sturdy
2.0,"I’m 5’1” 133 lbs, 36” bust and 30” waist. I typically wear a medium, sometimes a small. I ordered a medium but it felt too much like a small. The fit is just kind of weird since the back goes up so high it’s right at your neck. It’s oddly loose right at the armpit which is not appealing. Material feels like mostly spandex even though the shirt says it’s 95% cotton 5% spandex. It’s just not what I expected or wanted. Will be returning."
2.0,"Purse has a narrow opening at the top so beware if you use a large wallet or carry a sizeable makeup bag.  The purse itself is big enough it's just that the in and out of anything in your hand has to be finessed.  Also beware where it get shipped from.  Mine came slightly folded at the bottom (folding the solid base over to fit in the box) and won't stand up.  I notified the seller and was going to ship back but decided to see if I could re-shape it.  Unfortunately that didn't work and because I decide to mess with it rather that ship it back right away I forgot about it and missed the return date.  So I'm using it, it falls over and stuff falls out if I haven't closed the zipper.  Pain in the axx.<br /><br />Color is true to picture and a beautiful deep true purple (which is why I got it) and construction is what you'd expect from a purse in this price range.  So it gets two stars."
2.0,"I put these in my shirt pocket once. The fabric scraped off the gold coating in a few places and now they are literally useless. I really like them so I got another pair, I'll just be more careful."
2.0,"These are ok, but in the end go for the ones that slip over the whole ear peice.  They look like a clear sleeve, use those with the ones that look like circles.<br /><br />Put the circles on first, then the sleeves, then work the circles over the ends of the sleeves until at a comfortable position to hold your glasses in place.  Then apply close heat, not so close the sleeve melts off or damage to glasses. The goal is to shrink the sleeve tight.  Moving air from a controled source is ideal such as a heat gun with multiple settings temperature settings.<br /><br />Whole thing takes 5 minutes,  when you are done the sleeve turns transparent.  It doesn't stick out, and who cares; glasses are comfortable and the sleeve is still flexible enough to adjust. It just fits your individual glasses better.<br /><br />Enjoy"
2.0,This necklace does not have good quality. I can see the glue on it.
2.0,Didn't like that one side had a strange texture to it.  Thought it was ugly.  They also looked cheaply made.  I returned them.
2.0,Too large for any of my grown daughters or me.
2.0,"The bandana has no detail as pictured it is just plain red , also the picture feels like cheap vinyl and will probably peel easily ( I have not washed as of yet ) . Keeping just because I don't want to hassle with return. Probably will not be wearing it out of the house as my intention . The t-shirt itself is kinda silky feeling probably going to turn into a $16 bedtime shirt,  shame cause it looked cute."
2.0,Runs super small and it only covers the girls. Does not come down like the photo
2.0,"The picture is deceptive.<br />The PROS: The length is ok. The material is thick and soft.<br />The CONS: The POCKETS! In the picture the pockets appear to be at least 6"" deep... in reality the pants we received the wide-mouth pocket was only 3"" deep! You can't even put your hands in them much less a phone or anything else. I wouldn't have purchased these for my son if I'd known about the pockets.<br />Would not recommend."
2.0,"Ordered the correct size for the measurements, and it was way too short!"
2.0,Color fades so quickly from all the beads
2.0,Nice poor quality An didn’t hang off shoulder more like just sparkled tshirt
2.0,"The material was a bit thin, and the length was too short for me, so I gave them to my daughter."
2.0,"I like it, just that the size is totally of. Didn't want to go through the hastle of the return so I just gave it away."
2.0,"Great looking shirt, but unfortunately too small. My husband wears a medium fitted shirt and has for years. This one fit odd. It had an issue like some women's shirts, where it has the gapped opening around the cheat. My husband is very fit and we laughed about the way this shirt looked on him. Will be returning."
2.0,"I dunno if I got a knockoff or what but... This dress is about the weight and feel of a ""silk"" scarf- it's very see-thru and thin satiny- the straps are thin and poorly sewn on they will not last more then one or two wears- the red is more of an orange- it will be cool when the temps reach 90+ this summer but you will need smoothing under clothes.<br />For reference: I'm 5'4"" a size 8/10 and a 40 DD- I ordered a large and it's a pretty good fit- slightly tight in chest."
2.0,I don't like that after wearing them for only alittle the pattern is coming off. Really sucks.
2.0,This worked great but it just stopped working.
2.0,"To small. After an hour had to take it off, hurt my ears.  If you want to be Dumbo the elephant keep using it."
2.0,I ordered a large and it was a very small large
2.0,"Not really for large headed people,it's standard size and doesn't reduce sun rays very well"
2.0,"Quality is good, but unless you look with a magnifying glass, it looks like a giraffe. I cannot tell you how many times someone commented on my daughter’s “giraffe” necklace."
2.0,"It fits more like a 10 or 10 1/2, all the way in Jamaica, foot hanging off the back."
2.0,"These pajamas are SO cute! I’m a size 14-16 and I can normally wear an XL, but these fit almost like a medium."
2.0,"This shirt might look good on the model when she is perfectly posing, but it runs large, the arm wholes are huge and is unflattering because it doesn't stay in place (want a boob hanging out an arm hole??). I will not be wearing this."
2.0,"The “loose floral tank” style runs very small. I could barely get it over my bust, and I am small chested. I would size this as a small or XSmall — not a large. It’s super cute, but the sizing is way off."
2.0,"The product seemed OK, but I had to return it because it was significantly too large for my 5'1&#34; self."
2.0,"I'm 5'3 114 lbs and the small is way too tight.  It is a stretchy material so you see the outline of your jeans zipper and button if not tucked in. I purchased the light green and it is definitely a sage color, not exactly what I was expecting.  It is also quite a low cut scoop so there is a lot of skin showing.  Keep that in mind that it would be more for Spring than for Fall."
2.0,"Too big for my neck so I can't wear them. I'm 5'7, 140 lbs"
2.0,The back of the shirt is different.
2.0,Fit was not ideal
2.0,Within the first two weeks if using these on my daughters glasses the end piece that attaches to the glasses broke off completely. Waste of money don’t buy!!
2.0,Fits well and is durable. On the downside the fabric is very heavy and stiff and fades after just a few washes.
2.0,One of the buttons does not snap. I have to mess with it for a while just to get it to Clip.
2.0,No fue lo que mostraba el producto
2.0,"Honestly- this is really cheap looking and the letter made of stones is barely distinguishable from the hammered silver colored metal around it. You can’t tell it has an initial without a close inspection. The back of the necklace actually looks better than the front and redeems it a little.<br /><br />Even the packaging is a little disappointing. My 7 year old daughter was confused about why it was just loose in the box- a necklace insert to hold it in place would’ve made it a little more gift worthy. Personally, I don’t think this is worth more than a few dollars."
2.0,I’m 5’8”. 165lbs. usually wear a 40/38C<br /><br />I ordered according to the sizing guide in the picture and it was way too small.<br /><br />Which was too bad since I really like the color and the material seemed to be a good quality
2.0,Es muy fragil se rompio rapido
2.0,"If you're into cheap jewelry, here's your stop."
2.0,smaller than it looks no cash back returns only<br />amazon gift card
2.0,"Very cute, got lots of compliments, but it broke after a week. (Hands stopped moving, and then fell off)."
2.0,This is definitely forgiving but it was way too big. It's going back
2.0,"Cheap, scratchy, badly painted. Very disappointed,"
2.0,Way shorter than described.
2.0,Super confusing to figure out the straps.
2.0,I like the colors and the open fly front<br />I dislike when I first gun or in pool that the black dye ran  on the white
2.0,"This looks nothing like the photo.  It came folded up in a wad and the creases appear to be permanent.  I’m trying to see if I can flatten them with books or the blow dryer.  I was able to put tissue paper in the horns do they didn’t flop.  The black eyes were faded, but that was correctable with a sharpie.  But it is not smooth and hard formed like it appears in the photo.  That image is clearly photoshopped."
2.0,"Obscenely short, tried it as a tube top and just not cute for someone with larger breast. Best for super skinny, super short girls"
2.0,They're alright. Cheap though.
2.0,Fell apart within the week.
2.0,Can not wear as shorts definitely good for under dress or w/big shirt
2.0,I liked the look of them but you can’t bend them to fit your ear & their to heavy to stay on without pressure so pretty much useless!
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter.  It was a pretty locket. I would have given it more stars, but sadly was unable to really use it because the clasp to keep it closed didn’t work and it stays open. I tossed the packaging when received it because it was a gift and packaged decently,  Otherwise I would have asked for an exchange or return. I’d advise to spend the a little extra to get something that going to close and stay closed."
2.0,"This mask is cute and soft, but very thin. The nose wire is so thin that it's almost ineffective."
2.0,Too bad the burgundy part of the sweater bled on the white part! It fit good
2.0,I guess I did not realize how small these were. Hard to tell the words its so small. Not worth the money for these baby pins.
2.0,arrived with a white bleached spot on the front.
2.0,"Cute, but they do not stay on your legs very well"
2.0,Could not really see the baseball theme.  A little disappointed
2.0,I purchased this set for my 5 and 8 year olds. I love that they have pocket inserts and adjustable ears. But the set I received was huge. They were the same size as the adult set we have. My 8 year old can wear them but they cover his entire face. Still hunting for the perfect pair for the 5 year old.
2.0,They look great except they popped out repeatedly on male gym shoes. I am a senior with mobility issues and I purchased these because I have trouble bending. I will just switch to slip-on.
2.0,I am 5'7' and this tank top was WAY too short. It rode so high on me you would think it was a crop top or something! Such a shame because the print was actually nice!
2.0,The shirt collar (blue and grey one) was super wide... why ship it like that? for a couple of dollars..smh .. the other one was fine
2.0,Got black in one week necklece
2.0,Barbell is very cute however it does not come apart at the anchor which makes it very difficult to both get in or out of the ear piercing. The anchor is also kinda big and catches on everything  especially while sleeping. The material its made of also irritates my piercing which is why ive been trying to remove it for two days now with no luck.
2.0,"Not thrilled with these shorts. They look odd, especially the leg openings. The waist & hips fit, but the leg openings are almost flared they are so wide! I'm keeping them & but will only wear them when working in the garden or something."
2.0,"Was very aesthetically pleasing upon arrival, however One month later it lost its color and tarnished.<br />Looks completely rusted black now."
2.0,"Well they look pretty I guess. But I really don't like it because as soon as I put it on it hurt something horribly and when I removed it there was an indentation.<br />I got this because I don't want to get my nose pierced, so I was hoping I could just wear this out time to time, but with this pain I don't know if I'm going to put it back on :/<br /><br />But it will give you a good idea as to how you would look, but that's about it.<br />If you're really interested, you might as well just get it pierced for real.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
2.0,"Did not fit as expected, ordered it for my daughters first birthday and it’s way too wide on the bottoms and doesn’t stay on her shoulders"
2.0,"Disappointed in these as they aren't dark enough in strong sunlight. The color is cute and sporty , though."
2.0,I was so excited to get this dress. I ordered it in small and think perhaps it has been mislabeled as it is huge. So disappointed.
2.0,Didn’t look the way my wife expected.
2.0,Cheap looking but at least he price was cheap as well
2.0,"My head is by no means big, this hat would be awesome if it wasn't so shallow, I got it as a gag gift for my dad who has a bigger head than me, so I doubt it'll get much use, however I am hoping we can make some strategic cuts along the top to fix this problem."
2.0,"These were horribly made. Received them with strings coming out of them, and also the fingers were not all the way out, only to find it there is more cotton on the top of the fingers than needed. I'm glad I only need them for a skit. Pay a few more money if you need to use them outside of the home."
2.0,Very long !!! The only issue was that the sewn patches in the center of the veil were very messy . I had to trim around the edges  in order for me to be satisfied . The edges around the veil looks very nice though!! Overall the veil just needs some tweaking . You get what you paid for .
2.0,"Glasses work well, I ordered them in blue and got them in black which was a bit disappointing - honestly don’t want the hassle of returning them."
2.0,Not roomy enough room in the bust and arms.
2.0,I reallllly wanted to love these. They’re not for pale girls!! They’re more a pinky tone than tan so for someone with an olive complexion they probably look a lot better. They would probably also fit better on a short waisted person. I’m long waisted and I feel like they’re a little camel toe-ish....  I wore them through a workout and all day afterwards and I was continuously pulling them up. I gave 2 stars because they have pockets on both sides and around the waste band. I found them useful because I keep my phone in my pocket at the gym and it sometimes isn’t a great place for it in the thigh pocket.
2.0,"I liked how they looked, but they were very uncomfortable.  Sent back for a refund."
2.0,Sizing is accurate but they are super super see through. I have yet to wear these out of my house because they show everything.
2.0,The flower broke off after about 3 weeks and my phone wasnt protected.
2.0,They are SO CUTE and I am honestly SO SAD!!! I can NOT where them! I am 14/16 and was so excited! they are TIGHT AS HECK!!! Like - PAINFULLY!!!!! they go up and then they squeeze in an aweful painful way-- but I knew it was a gamble with thick thighs-- if you have lots of thigh-- just DONT -- if your thighs are THINNER-- these would be GREAT and sexy!!!
2.0,"Do not buy cheap sun glasses, it is not worth the money,save and buy a better quality! Cheap, Cheap, Cheap."
2.0,Comes apart way to quick
2.0,Band is not as comfortable as original and the cases are not a good fit & poorly quality. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Received item 1 day early, well packaged! the Coat is as photographed, but please be aware that the size chart in the description is not accurate for plus size wearers, the reviewers on this item may be on the smaller side, based on the size chart given I ordered my size and found that the coat was two (2) or 3 sizes too small, I could not even close it around my bottom or breast! For my apple's I am 220lbs, size 38DDD 5.4 and this coat dose not fit at all! if you are on the smaller size, this is a beautiful item to add to your wardrobe. looks warm and worth the money for you. if you are larger then a US size 18p keep shopping."
2.0,"I was really excited to get these it's pretty looks nice Made well the opening is too big so if you put your glasses in them and you lean over they fall right out so I don't use them what is a waste of money, if the opening were smaller they woud be perfect."
2.0,"Kept it, but do not wear it.  Top too small, rest too large and baggy, low quality fabric."
2.0,small order two sizes bigger. depends on how you want it to fit.
2.0,"Had to return, they were way too small. It says's &#34;women's&#34; I think it might be teen sized."
2.0,"The scarf is really pretty and the colors are awesome! However, there are so many loose fibers and they keep getting in my eye. It’s cheaply made. I’ve ruined my makeup like ten times now because I’ve been trying to get these loose fibers out. I’ve stopped wearing it all together and gave it to my cousin so that I can be her problem."
2.0,"I didn't like these pant's due to the fact I couldn't get them to relax. I even soaked them in softener for 2 day's Also, the flap seemed to short (only a few inches from my hip)"
2.0,"The only good thing, it arrived way early. I purchased style A3. I am 5'1. It does not hang, it clings badly. The size is too small, sewn horribly with thread hanging everywhere. I will probably give it away, too much to send back. I was so excited until i put it on. The length is great fit however, too tight"
2.0,"Was surprised that something that looks so cute in the picture would only be a few bucks.... You get what you pay for. Its not horrible, just not of high quality. The rope is the worst part, weird bendy material that doesn't fit well around your wrist. The baubles (handcuffs, etc.) Are cute though, just not as big as they look in the picture."
2.0,Not as warm as I’d like in Chicago winters. But comfortable and fit well.
2.0,Looks like a cheap piece of faux-leather-covered plastic or rubber. Returned it immediately.
2.0,"You should size up with this dress but still the proportions are wrong, the cleavage is too wide and the skirt below is too tight. I ordered XL, usually wear 14-16"
2.0,"Looked awful on. I hoped to wear this for the summer. If I do wear it, it will only be inside my house."
2.0,"The armpits fit a little snug and I wasn't into the way the zipper felt, so I gave it away.  Someone else might this just fine but for me, I think I am not going to buy clothes online anymore because it can fit in general just fine but still be a little uncomfortable to wear.  If you are the type of person bugged by small sensory issues with your clothing, like the lines of your socks or tags on clothing bothering you, then the zipper on this might mean this jumpsuit is not for you.  It's a cute color though, and the material feels nice."
2.0,"Short material is soft and comfortable<br /> However, I ordered medium the first time and exchanged for small later. Still large"
2.0,Was not a huge fan of the sizing difference between the pants and top. Pants were extremely small for a medium and the sides of the top were exposing.
2.0,Hats fit great but came in different colors- rather than a red and tan hat I got a beige and tan one!- lame!
2.0,The fit is good but the neck it super tight and like a turtleneck. I have to cut the back strap to loosen it up a bit. Nice color but sadly not my style in the front :(
2.0,"We used them as party favors, and the younger girls loved them. We had some adults that thought they looked like cheaper pearl knockoffs, but great for kids!"
2.0,"I received this item without the card, that the necklace was suppose to come with! It came in a small  baggie. The card has a quote written on it, that's significant as to the meaning of the elephant. That's why I bought it, because  of the that quote on the card. I'm not going to send it back. I'll make the card with those words on it and hang the elephant  pendant on it, and for that reason. I'm going to rate it 2 Stars. Not happy with this product!"
2.0,don't like it.The quality is not good.Not real cotton and too small.
2.0,Cute little bracelet but Not what I ordered.  It was three little teddy bears.  I ordered an enameled unicorn on the bracelet.  It also had a place to engrave her name.
2.0,the material feels cheap. there is no built in bra and overall not a fan. I wore one to check it out to confirm i didn't like it. I didn't. I feel like it will also hold smells in the material after many wears (bo/soap/deoderant smells). Just keep an eye out for that.
2.0,"Should have ordered an xl instead of a m.  Super cheep, made poorly, see through.  Cute design though."
2.0,"SUPER wide frame, and curved towards the face .... not in love, gave them away"
2.0,"My review might not be fair, because i received a different set than i ordered, probably not the sellers fault. The beads seem to be of high quality. One of the bracelets ended up breaking on me within a month of purchase."
2.0,"I’m 5’6”, 140 pounds, 32D. Ordered a M. Top is almost too small and bottoms are baggy. Only looks good when I pose certain ways, unflattering for my body type."
2.0,"This fabric feels really cheap and a little scratchy.  Having said that, all of the Easel garments I have EVER purchased in the past are wonderful quality fabric,  which is why I didn't hesitate to buy this one.  I almost feel as if someone sewed it up in some scary back room and stuck an Easel label in it...but, that's my opinion"
2.0,Fabric is good. Shirt is not very long and the XL fits more like a L.
2.0,"Really sad, I wanted to love these with my whole heart. The sizing is just not good. I have been a 1/2” (12mm) for years and the ones I received were more like a 0g, they would just fall out of my ear. I was thinking maybe they just run a little small, so I ordered the 9/16” (14mm) but they are way too big couldn’t even stretch my ear enough to get them in. Giving two stars because if you get a pair that fit you they’ll be REALLY nice. But if not you’re out of luck it seems."
2.0,"The neck hit me weirdly on this... It needed to be a deeper scoop, I think? Or perhaps a v-neck.  As it was, it was a crew that hit me at a weird place and the print also hit at a weird place, so it went back. For reference I am fairly short and usually wear an XL."
2.0,sits funny :/
2.0,The straps broke almost right away!
2.0,"Ordered this ""dark purple"" mask specifically because in the pic they are ALL PURPLE.  As you can see, my masks are not and have white trim.  Not what I was hoping for."
2.0,This is definitely a very cheapy sweater. The material is crap and the print looks bad.
2.0,I really like the colors but the size is too small. Being extra large I was thinking they would fit!
2.0,"They are super thin. Scratchy material.  I bought them to wear under my clothing for when on my motorcycle. The purpose was moisture wicking. I’m 5’4”, 160 # I’m a muscle build and these fit ok except they are so darn short, you can’t tuck them even into high wasted jeans and sit down without them untucking. They were PERFECT until I washed them as per directions on clothing label."
2.0,Too big and not good quality
2.0,can't take pic through the plastic
2.0,"Honestly this watch is really cute, but it’s definitely not worth the price. The camera quality is horrific. The “mini games” have absolutely no relationship with L.O.L surprise. This is absolutely not worth purchasing. It’s awful."
2.0,"This an adorable nighty, it's certainly not a tank top"
2.0,Cheap straps
2.0,The pattern and material are nice and the top fits as expected. What I did not expect is the mermaid hemline. I did not expect the back to be longer than the front. It was not until I was at an event that I realized the hemline was not right. It makes the dress look childish and I would not have bought the dress if I had realized the hemline was not a straight cut. I have not decided what to do as I do not believe I can return it after having worrn it. I do not recommend this dress.
2.0,not small in size but not the length it shows on their picture. Wrinkles badly too. Stiff fabric.
2.0,So when I purchased these I thought they were tight fitting.Turns out they aren't.These are very loose on me. These were supposed to leggings I could use for my workouts and I no longer use them.
2.0,The sizing on this dress is way off. If you are plus sized then you should order up a size or two. The arms are cut too small as well.
2.0,Does not look the same as the picture. In the product image it shows the &#34;ruffle&#34; as being the same color as the rest of the shirt. The ruffle was a very light pale sheer blue over a very dark blue shirt. It made me feel like I was wearing a cape from a Halloween costume. I didn't like it.
2.0,Got a large and could barely get it on. Super short as well. Put it on my 9 year old who is only 70lbs and barely fit her.
2.0,"This is not what I expected.  The fabric looks very loose and flowing, maybe even like a sweatshirt, but it is more of a sweater fabric, and it truly feels like wool feels when you have put it through the washing machine by mistake. This one is going back."
2.0,"While I had the belt for about a year, I only wore it around a dozen times for work.  As others noted, the belt buckle is fairly fragile where it spins for switching colors (see attached image).  This was not a bargain priced belt and was disappointed to have it fail after so few times being worn.  I contacted the seller to see if they could help out and got absolutely no response.  I would not recommend this belt and have adjusted my review star rating accordingly.  I have left my original review below for reference.<br /><br />**** Original Review ****<br />This is a black/brown reversable leather belt which comes very well packaged.  The belt buckle has a plastic cover and the belt itself is in a fabric style sleeve.  This all means that you will get the belt without any scuffs and looking as well as possible out of the packaging.  While I got this for myself, the packaging is such that it would look nice as a gift, though I would have preferred the barcoded sticker be on the box bottom so the more attractive lid would appear a bit more gift worthy.<br /><br />The listing images can be confusing and lead you to thinking two belts are coming but are only trying to highlight that there are two colors on this reversable belt.  I knew this but wanted to clarify as I could see it being confusing based on the image.  Also, the brown is really dark and fairly close to the black.  I prefer black belts so this is fine for me, but if you are looking for a true brown then this may not be the belt for you.  Some leather items will arrive with an odor, but this belt does not have this issue.<br /><br />The belt is true to size and was almost exactly the same length as other belts I have with the same sizing.  I have only worn it once so far, but there was no stretching of the notch holes and the belt itself still looks good after a day of use.  It is easy to flip the buckle between sides - basically a slight pull and spin of the buckle does the trick."
2.0,"Neckline too rel too revealing {for me, anyway} and material not summer weight."
2.0,fits way to big! def size down!
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:1c864629c7f980f6d422bad2576dcfff]] Very cute sweetheart, size was surprisingly correct. However, after wearing it, the vinyl is peeling up. I am so tired of amazon allowing these junk companies to sell their misleading, garbage products. I guess i have a false sense of security when I shop on amazon. I did not think that they would allow sellers who sell poor quality items. I am super disappointed. Amd now I'll have to fight for a refund, because unfortunately, this was not a cheap sweatshirt."
2.0,I had same problem ordered an xl and its not even close. great quality an love the look just not an Xl.
2.0,The bracelet looks very pretty; just as I got it I put it on and right away it broke by the clasp; not a good quantity at all.
2.0,bought this for my sister who is very small build and this skirt was STILL too small.
2.0,Every bracelet i have worn has broken!!
2.0,"Nice dress, just don't buy the gray"
2.0,I bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loved them.  I loved them.  She put them on right after open presents and then sat and helped me cut potatoes and snap beans.  When she got up we noticed that there were 4 runs going down the back of the pants.  She is in no way a big woman (size 4-6) so I was a little upset that they were already running.  Luckily it's only on the seat of the pants right now and she plans on wearing them with a long tshirt or shorts so I doesn't effect her wearing them but still disappointing.
2.0,It’s uncomfortable really hard to bend
2.0,"Guys. These are the biggest damn glasses in all of the land.  I have a pretty large face, and these are too big.  When I smile or laugh and my cheeks move them, they literally fall off (I actually managed to break mine that way).  I like the darkness of them and the polarized lens, and for the price they aren't too ugly looking (def cheap looking tho) but they're so big that they are basically not usable."
2.0,"material is really stiff, bit difficult to walk in. tight in the forefoot but too much room in the heel causing slippage.returned these."
2.0,Pretty but the certificate comes with it is fake. Assume the product is most likely fake. I still kept it because it’s pretty.
2.0,The color was beautiful. However the feathers fell out the moment there was any movement or touching. Was constantly shedding.
2.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; , 190 lbs. The 3X was so small I couldn't get it over my thighs. There was very little stretch to it. I'm sure if it was the right size it would hold everything in nicely. Unfortunately, the material just felt rough, so I know it would have irritated my skin."
2.0,It’s got slits on the sides.. Also it’s cut very full under the arms and almost gives the impression of being toooooo big..
2.0,The dress was sewn irregularly. The hip area was sewn specific to a body type so it didn't fit properly.
2.0,Much smaller than expected.  Wear as pajamas
2.0,I have the large Apple Watch band and ordered a M/L as the product description advised and this fits like the small Apple Watch band. This is definitely not true to the Apple Watch band sizes
2.0,Not worth the money. As soon as you bend down it will bust open.
2.0,"The backpack itself is cute and looks to be of good quality. However, the one I received had San Antonio Zoo embroidered on it. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement, but said they couldn’t guarantee it won’t have the embroidering. And sure enough, the second one did too. I’m returning them both and ordering from a different seller."
2.0,"Was not feeling this at all. Looked good in the picture, but the material reminds me of something from the early 90s. Remember Rayon shirts? Yes, that is what the fabric is like. Plus, it is very thin, and there are strings hangin everywhere. It looks good, but the quality sucks, and unfortunately I need to wear something that feels good too. Would not  suggest you waste your money. You can get something very similar for around the same price from Zara."
2.0,Liked the fit but only lasted me a couple months before they broke.
2.0,"A nice soft easy on and off band, however if you actually have it tight enough so it doesn't twist around your wrist while exercising the slightest amount of pressure pops the band off. I had tested to see if the quick release was coming undone and that was not the issue, the pin itself was too short. And the 20mm should be the correct size for my watch."
2.0,The material is thin and rises up. I would like to find a package deal like this but in a different Material
2.0,"Maybe these would fit someone else better, as everyone is clearly different. They didn't fit my lip. It was so tight it was literally pulling the skin so tight around the lip, I woke up with a red, sore mess. Maybe someone else would love these, but I couldn't wear them."
2.0,This is not the same brand as the other three that I bought. It is COMPLETELY see through. The others by Grocelle do not have a seem in the back. This one does.  I'm def ordering the other brand
2.0,The top is beautiful. However once I rinsed it out it completely lost it's shape
2.0,"Sizing, sizing, sizing, I could barely breath when I attempted to put this on, beautiful pattern, great dress for casual Friday's, date night, or a night out with the girls if you can get in it."
2.0,The belts sent had two holes instead of one. They did not match the images.
2.0,not good they didn’t show butt go age and it was very tiny and the cups came small and far apart
2.0,"Took a very long time to arrive, quality is poor"
2.0,Cardboard in hat bill means not able to wash :(
2.0,Was really hoping to like this one since I like that type of design. I think it’s very flattering…. But!<br />The fabric doesn’t feel nice. The shirt was cut faulty? Wasn’t seating right in the upper back area.
2.0,"I ordered these gold earrings thinking to upgrade my swagg, But these earrings are Baby size like for a baby or toddler , Im a grown man! when i wear earrings i want people to know im wearing them, thats the point! but these aren't only small but painful, if i wear them longer then 3-4 hours my ears start buring & feeling pinched by the backs of the earrings.. I only paid 1 penny plus 5.99$ shipping & handling so i aint super pissed! plus i sold them to my sister for her lil boy for 2$ at least i made something back lol.."
2.0,You definitely need to size up one or two on the shirt. I wear large extra large and ordered an extra large and could barely get it buttoned. I left a voicemail with customer service and had no response. I had to stretch this shirt just sort of ripping it so that it would fit halfway decent for my costume.
2.0,Runs smaller then it should be.
2.0,"These won't fit a 4yr old, and not as warm as they look. Period."
2.0,"I was disappointed. First,  It was in a soft package instead of a box. Took it out and was terribly wrinkled. It arrived the day of my event and no time to launder. Second, I didn't think it hung like the picture showed.  A little snug through the torso for my liking."
2.0,"I got sent the wrong item at first, and the replacement was too big. If you’re in between sizes order down! Very slick feel."
2.0,Beautiful crafted bag if you want a small bag.
2.0,This was very large and I felt like I was wearing a tent.  If you are a tiny person it is probably very cute on.  The colors are beautiful.  I wish there was a different style in the same pattern for larger women.
2.0,Looks as cheap as it is....no point sending it back....I'll actually lose money doing so.
2.0,"Masks were a good price, but the material irritated my skin. It felt scratchy and rough."
2.0,I have not tried it on but right out of the package I was disappointed. I ordered the gold and it is definitely rose gold. It is pretty but I ordered it for a costume and was looking for a gold shirt. Not pink and rose gold.
2.0,Sizing way off. Probably 2 sizes to small
2.0,Ordered same ones a year ago and they were soooo much thicker. These are thin and not really thermal.
2.0,"This product does what it says and keeps the mask from touching your mouth. The bad thing is that it ends up when breathing that it heats up the insert and reflects the breath back onto the face making me feel hotter than without. It was an experiment to see how these might help, but no one in my family could stand wearing them."
2.0,It made me look bigger than I am. It looks very cheap
2.0,"This pattern is so cute but it unfortunately runs small. The fabric has no give. I am usually a small and ordered that size and I can’t even get the pants over my hips. If you purchase this, size up one to two sizes. The top does fit correctly though, and it is crop top style."
2.0,Wife Likes IT
2.0,Received very discolored and scratchy
2.0,"I ordered this 4 pack, and 2 of the 4 pairs ripped at the front seam while putting them on. The 2 pairs that were left, fit nice and are comfortable, but with a 50% success rate on the underwear holding up,  i wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,Too tight on the arms and too loose around the hips. Material is not so good. Had to return. Also the lace around the neck area did not hold up.
2.0,THEY CAME IN FINE AS ADVERTISED THEY JUST DIDN'T WORK WITH WHAT I HAD MY FAULT
2.0,"is waay too small - no width, just 2 pieces of fabric sewn together. very cheaply made. adjustable strap is heaviest part of purse, but a tangled mess to use.<br />did get a compliment first day I carried it, but is now on shelf gathering dust. if you want a small to medium purse to carry a lightweight load you might be ok with it.<br />I would love to find a well-made LARGE hobo bag that looks like this, it is a really pretty bag.  but dont let the dimensions here fool you.  they did me."
2.0,Smaller than expected. And the way they hang off the ears is awkward.
2.0,"I bought these as a cheap alternative to my 5.11 pants.  They are just that, cheap.  I've known other people who've had better luck, but the zippers on these are really cheap and mine blew out a week after my return window closed."
2.0,This was really larger than I thought it would be.
2.0,"Nice item, but it stuck a little when I tried to unfold it and then I noticed that there was a hole where it had stuck at but I'm sure that it'll be rectified."
2.0,"All of the dresses like this are perfect, except this one. The pattern is not flattering on me at all. It might look great on someone else. Just not me. These dresses are very soft and comfortable. I have purchased about ten of them."
2.0,"I don’t like the material so much. It’s thicker than I like, and not as soft as I prefer. It does hold you in fairly well."
2.0,Cheap product.....l
2.0,"To be honest, for the price, I wasn't expecting much.  The very thin material was expected, but the Totoro face was a few inches off to one side, which looked bad when wearing the sweatshirt."
2.0,Large on me
2.0,Fabric was ok but the cut was horrible specially in the front. Had to return it .
2.0,Really not helpful for headlight glare
2.0,Nice belt but surprised to find metal piece fall off on about the 6th use
2.0,cloth is not good.
2.0,Not impressed with this shirt.
2.0,"I ordered this ring in a size 7 for my fiance and it was too big. We went to see if we could get it sized but were told that there is NO WAY it could be sized or have any beads attached to it to get it to fit better because it would ruin the silver plating of the ring. I would've exchanged it but there was no size 6 offered. The ring looks the same in person and is quite pretty, but ORDER ONE SIZE SMALLER otherwise there's no way to fix it. If you lower than a size 7 just look at other rings."
2.0,"Bought this for my grand daughter and she loved it, worn it for 2 weeks and it broke...Send it back for refund."
2.0,Does not stay in place and the foam cups are too small.
2.0,The picture shows red and brown the dress is brown and burgundy
2.0,"Don't buy if you're pregnant, they will go under your breasts."
2.0,These socks would have been amazing if they hadn't sewn the sizes into the bottom of the socks.  If your getting these for a kid with sensory issues I wouldn't recommend. The bump from the thread will drive them nuts. Otherwise they would have been perfect
2.0,I’m normally a size 10 and I ordered this dress and an XL large. It is a very pretty color and super cute dress but it would barely go over my boobs. Once I got it on and zipped up the side I couldn’t  move my arms because it was so tight I was afraid it was going to rip.
2.0,"Didn't fit as expected, crotch strings wouldn't stay in place. Great packaging though."
2.0,Not as nice as photo. I wont buy this again.
2.0,I bought this in Feb and by June (4 months) it was stretched out and no longer wearable.  I would expect something like this to at least last a year....<br />It was nice the first 3 months though.
2.0,"Weird material, not stretchy at all. Sizes are very small! If worn to the gym, it’s see through when bending."
2.0,"These run way to big for me. Very uncomfortable.  Falls down inside my boots. But , are perfect for my husband.  He loves em."
2.0,Very slippery at the bottom which can make your baby fall. Don't recommend it at all.
2.0,"I love the print on this dress - the colors are vivid and pretty.  I was disappointed in the fabric and fit of this dress.  The fabric doesn't have any &#34;give&#34; and is easily wrinkled. The lack of stretch makes the fit small. Unfortunately, I have to return."
2.0,The description said it was 80cm. It is 65cm. Too short for my purpose. Itd pretty. Just cant use it for what I intended.
2.0,"It doesn’t lay well on the neck, because it’s rigid, it sticks straight out, which may be what you’re going for . . ."
2.0,Good product received on time and thought I got a great bargain.  Broke in 4 months.
2.0,It looks great! However when I received it it was smashed it not it looks messed up I don't know how to fix it very disappointed
2.0,The Earrings are tiny !!  Nice color
2.0,"Fit nicely, soft and warm inside and so cute!  bad thing is that I am missing the balls on the tan pair as you can see in the picture.  This affects the wear as that glove is loose and not snug due to the elastic missing with the balls.  The weren't in either bag. :( .. *update. Balls popped off other tan glove when trying to put it on. I'm sad,  I liked them"
2.0,Got for my almost 3 yr old and they were really hard to get on
2.0,"Definitely sent the wrong size.  Size not mentioned on the product, but it is much too large.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"The quality is fine, the inner zippers are a little sticky, but the most disappointing part was the size. The photos with the woman make the bag look like a great oversized tote for travel, truly it's barely bigger than a normal purse. Granted, I should have looked closer at the dimensions listed and not trust the photos, but I do feel a little duped. I would not have bought the bag if I had known how small it was."
2.0,Not that nice. The pants and shirt are cheap nylon. Not fleece. They will work for a cute Christmas photo but not comfy and warm to snuggle up in. Not happy with the quality of this item.
2.0,"very pretty to look at, but it's way too big for me.  removing a link would help but there were no instructions how to do that"
2.0,This watch is cute but it came delivered already turned on & with an alarm on which is annoying because it was a gift and I couldn’t turn it off without opening the whole package. Also who knows how long it’s been on & if the battery is any good
2.0,Mi purchased this for my 6 year old son. I only recently started using it in our trip to California. My some plays a lot and one time he came to me and showed me that the flap of one of his sandals was broken . I have already passed the return window as well and thus purchase was only waste of money for me.
2.0,"This product is a cute accessory for a cat lover like myself, but I felt upset and disappointed that I was misled by the advertising. It says (1 count) but, like any normal person, I assumed that meant one pair of earrings (because who sells a single earring?). I did not even bother returning it or buying a second one to round out the pair due to the long shipping time and the fact that the price rose in the few days after I received the first one. Be aware that this is ONLY ONE EARRING!"
2.0,It kept raising up it would not stay down.  And it was not fitted.
2.0,"The quality of this dress was disappointing. I guess I shouldn't be surprised for the price, but the fabric was just not what I was looking for. Also, not necessarily the dress's fault, but it looked frumpy on me as well, had to return."
2.0,"Misleading description and photo. The dress has an ugly elastic above the waist that is not visible in the pictures, and is scrunched up below it. The material is almost certainly not rayon, feels like polyester or similar. The quality of stiches is pretty bad.<br />It seems to be true to size and the color/pattern is as pictured. There are two side pockets that I find ugly because they affect the shape of the dress, but they might be potentially useful."
2.0,Very large like 2 sizes.insole hard as a rock
2.0,junk took weeks to recieve not worth the wait
2.0,"I ordered a 2X. The tag read 2X, but the fit was more like a medium. However, the look and feel of the material is very nice."
2.0,"I am a 34DD or F, depending on the bra, and bought a large. A large usually works for me with sports bras. Unfortunately, not this one. The band felt too tight, more like a 32, and the straps felt too short and dug down into my trapezius muscles. Sent it back."
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture.  I guess you get what you paid for.  Not happy at all.
2.0,I’ve not actively worn the tops but I tried one on and the neck is extremely stretched out and the shirts are not flattering in my opinion . I suppose they might be “serviceable” but I don’t care for them.
2.0,"I bought this for Fathers Day for my husband for who drives a Grand Sport, but I can’t possibly give this to him.  It’s the quality of a promotional giveaway cap.  Flimsy and thin.  Also very shallow.  Returning immediately."
2.0,"Love the look and size of this wallet. However, when I put cards in it, it left a sticky residue on the side of the cards. Not happy about that."
2.0,Large (my usual size) was too small. This is a thin sweater and I think over priced for what you get. No tags indicating care instructions or material composition.
2.0,"I knew I was taking a risk with this wig with the low price but figured with as low as it was, I'd give it a shot.  I knew as soon as I picked it up out of the packaging why it was half the price of my other wigs, as there wasn't even enough hair to cover the mesh cap the hair was sewn onto!<br /><br />I own quite a few cosplay wigs and this one is EXCEPTIONALLY thinner than the others.  I'd say it has about half as much hair as any of the other wigs.  YES the hair on it is nice, not a bad quality, but it is incredibly thin!  I had a VERY VERY difficult time styling the wing just for a picture from the front and getting it to cover the mesh it's sewn onto.  Moving some hair so cover mesh showing on the right just exposed mesh on the left.<br /><br />For a picture I had to pull all of the hair in front of my shoulders and leave none in the back to make it look like I had a normal amount of hair.  Wearing it out to a party or a con would be out of the question unless you had two to combine.<br /><br />The other problem the thin hair creates is because it is a white wig you really need to have blonde hair or a bald cap or something on beneath it or expect to have patches of dark showing through.  My black hair beneath it made it VERY obvious I was wearing a wig.<br /><br />Bottom line:  You're probably not going to find something nicer for $16 but if you want something nice that doesn't have the mesh showing spend the $30 on a nice one."
2.0,"Their ok, but a little bigger than I wanted."
2.0,The buttons on the dress have no functionality.  They are merely for looks.
2.0,This 9 fits more like a 7.
2.0,"The strap and hole lengths are long, best fit is last hole and then the strap sticks out far. Would return if not worn already."
2.0,Thick and warm. I just wanted grip socks for hardwood floors and it's surprising how rare they are.<br />Update; Ok so I reduced my 5 star review to 3 stars because the tops don't stay on! They keep shipping off which is so so annoying!
2.0,They don't cover the pads of my feet as I would like. They don't provide the smooth gliding over the floor in my modified ballet class.  The thingy between the toes is not comfortable and has to fit between my second and third toes to make them kind of line up better on the bottom of my feet. I had to keep adjusting them throughout class.  Definitely a disappointment.
2.0,"I regret buying this on every level. The navy color looks faded and cheap, the fabric is extremely sheer and loose stretchy, so it hangs unflatteringly. The length is too long to be knee length but too short to be midi. I couldn't return it, so I tried a last-ditch effort to tighten up the weave of the fabric: i washed it according to the instructions and tumble dried on medium, like the tag says. It didn't help, just made the fabric wrinkly. Do not recommend!"
2.0,I like these but they're too big for my fingers or knuckle area. Not able to wear anyother place.
2.0,"The necklace looked very nice, but unfortunately the tooth fell out and was lost after less than a week."
2.0,"This fit was very large. I ordered a large because I'm a US size 12 top (36DDD) and this fit was too large for me. If it had adjustable straps, I might have kept it, but there was no way to make it work because it wasn't adjustable. It also looked and felt more like a swimming suit top rather than a bralette or sports bra."
2.0,I normally wear an XL of which I purchased but this one was very tight and took a while to for me to wear.  I would have gone another size up but unfortunately they don't have XXL and the material barely stretched.  Not even sure if this is an Asian size and had to return the item.
2.0,"its eh not the best. the &#34;C&#34; fell off within a week of my husband using it, so not worth the money if you ask me."
2.0,"Dress didn’t fit correctly,  left side bust would not stay in place, right hip area seemed to puckered with extra fabric and hem of dress was not straight. Not to mention the dress smelled horrible when it arrived and had no tags on it other than a hand written size."
2.0,Zips are broken after few uses. Very disappointing.
2.0,The skirt is cumbersome. Very stiff.
2.0,"Didn't hold shape, like jello"
2.0,"My son has Cerebral Palsy and can walk independently but can sometimes drag his foot so we bought these shoes because of the thick sole, and the sole is awesome. Seriously this sole is lasting pretty well compared to other shoes in the past. What I wasn't expecting was that after one month the fabric of the shoe is pulling away from the sole, the zipper is ripping and his orthodic wore a hole in the side. Please know that as an 8 year old boy he is super rough on the shoes, but he only wears them on week days so they wore through in 25 days of wearing. It might be true that my son can only wear thick leather shoes, but if your child is rough on shoes these may not be the right choice."
2.0,Way too pink!
2.0,"Material is not what expected, runs small, and the pocket is already separating at the Sean from shirt."
2.0,"This shirt was pretty, soft, and fit comfortably, however the first time I laundered it (gentle cycle, cool water, by itself) it got a lot of little pulls in the fabric! Very disappointed"
2.0,"Even following the sizing chart, this did not fit well whatsoever. I was able to get it to close, but not without my husbands help (and chuckles). After I got it closed I had a bunch of lumps and bumps, and it dug in making it super uncomfortable to wear. I'm giving it 2 stars because the chart doesn't seem to match, but if you're of a smaller build, it *could* work. But it would really require a small frame and longer torso, in my opinion.<br /><br />I received this item for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review of the product. I never guarantee positive reviews."
2.0,"The chest is too big not match the body.If you don't have a big chest, that's not appropriate."
2.0,"This dress has thick and comfortable fabric, but the neck is so high I feel like I’m choking. I wish I could get this dress altered :("
2.0,This blouse unfortunately was too big for me.
2.0,Didn't fit and too thick and stiff to bend to my ear
2.0,I ordered an extra large after reading previous reviews. They are still too tight. I typically wear a medium so I'm a bit disappointed. Not sending them back in the hopes that I will be able to fit in then in the near future if I continue my workout program.
2.0,The watch itself is very pretty but the strap tore off in 1 month. The case is still working and pretty. Wish it could be fixed or had a bracelet strap
2.0,The Top was not comfortable. The material did not feel good.
2.0,"The shelves are flimsy snap-in cardboard dividers. The compartments are small and cramped. There isn't really a good place for wet stuff (bathing suit for example). The whole thing is heavy. One day I found myself just stuffing a change of clothes in a grocery bag, shampoo in a second grocery bag, and leaving the Glo Bag at home - - and the grocery-bag system turned out to be quicker and more convenient. Plus, after workout I can bring the 'dirty stuff' grocery bag straight into the house whilst leaving the 'gear' grocery bag in the garage ready for tomorrow."
2.0,"So I ordered a size four for my daughter to wear to a wedding. The shoe is a full size smaller. The blue shoe in the picture is my daughter's everyday shoe and IS a size 4. It wasn't a hook and loop close either, it is a buckle."
2.0,These glasses are much bigger than they look
2.0,Was super satisfied when the charm came and was very happy to give it to my mom as one of her birthday presents but she's only had the charm on her bracelet for a week or 2 and it's already tarnished.
2.0,"I ordered the yellow lenses for driving and shooting. I installed the lenses in my Oakley Flak Draft frames and initially one lens kept snapping out. I then adjusted the lens and it appears to be firmly in place, so I expect that I just didn't install it properly initially. I will update this review if I notice that it isn't holding in place.<br /><br />Overall, the lens seems to be of good quality and I expect that it will serve my needs. I ordered the 6 pack of lenses as well and will update with a review on those once I receive those lenses as well.<br /><br />Update:<br />I'm still undecided on these lenses. I want to like them, but then part of me just wants to buy the real deal and be done with it.<br /><br />These are quite a bit thinner than the original Oakley lenses. In fact wiping a lens clean with the micro fiber cloth, caused it to pop loose because it doesn't fit 100% like the original Oakleys.<br /><br />These (Yellow) lenses, I use for driving in low light and they actually cause glare of oncoming lights that actually make them distracting to use while driving.<br /><br />For the price, I am actually disappointed overall in the quality of the lens. I think a fair price for a lens of this quality would be approximately $7. Based on that, I paid about $13 too much for it to be a worthy purchase."
2.0,"Bought as a bridesmaid dress.<br />Go up several sizes so your waist fits, and expect to have to hem it.<br />I’m 5’7, 127#s. This dress in a size 6 (I usually wear a 2) had room in the bust for D cups, a tight waist that barely fit me, and needed to be hemmed 4 inches.<br />Unless you’re a 6 foot hour glass with a 20” waist, expect expensive alterations.<br />Also, the armpits will rub you raw, the inside was scratchy feeling, and the mesh netting at the top would best be described as the flesh tone of our president.<br />Couldn’t have hated this thing more."
2.0,"Love these, have three pairs. But after only 3 months, the seams are starting to go. Disappointed."
2.0,The letters on the band is very light and can't really read that it says love on the band.
2.0,broke after a month.
2.0,The XL size is touted by this co. as being good for foot sizes up to 14. Bingo. I ordered a pair. Before I managed to get one sock onto my foot it became clear that this is more optimistic than true. My return is in the mail. To the company: Please create an XXL for 14s.
2.0,"I am a cyclist and the shorts fit as expected everywhere except they're  a little snug in the thighs.  Also, washed them before wearing and there are several threads loose at the inseam.  Will be sending back for replacement."
2.0,It's cute but wish it was longer
2.0,"Came with a brown hat (more round than triangular like in the picture), an inflatable globe and a very flimsy plastic telescope. I was underwhelmed. If I had been able to see it beforehand I would not have bought it."
2.0,Broke in 3 days. Granted a child had it... but it should be more durable for the price. Wish I spent  $2 instead.
2.0,"Cardboard  not fabric,  missing  range of colors  like red."
2.0,"Its pretty and true to size, but the bottom of dress ripped at the seam. Only got to wear it twice."
2.0,"This was ok if you wear it for a short while. Once it hits 30mins+, you can feel the edges starting to push onto the feet which makes it uncomfortable. Wore this for two hours and both foot kind of sore on where the edges of the sandals were pushing. It was ok to wear it for 20mins, but if you’re planning to walk in it for more than 30mins, this is not recommended."
2.0,2 of them broke instantly. As I tried to open the clasp on the anklets it would just break apart. I’m glad I checked them first because I was going to gift them to my niece for her bday.
2.0,Not meant for someone with large breasts! Otherwise it is cute
2.0,Loved color/style but pj's are  almost see through-
2.0,Sizing is not right. Way too small. Doesn't look like pic. Had to send back
2.0,"The sweater was nice and soft, but ran small. I ordered an XL and it fits more like an M/L."
2.0,Not as flexible or giving as one would think it should be.
2.0,"I’m 6’3 and it fit, although the sleeves were short(may not be the shirts fault) it’s really cute too look at but it’s such thin material it’s terrible. I’m returning it because I’m so disappointed. I thought it would be more of a sweatshirt or even tshirt material but it’s just like  a cheap fabric, definitely not worth 22 dollars."
2.0,"I like these leggings, but they run small and they are really tight along the seems in the crotch and booty area. I ordered a size up and they are still a tad small. Order atleast two sizes up."
2.0,It's ok.. it's very thin and form fitting. It did not have the scoop bottom like the picture.
2.0,"They are so so cute, but they fall out of my nose easily in my sleep. If I wipe my face with a towel they fall out with the towel. 2 stars for how pretty they are."
2.0,"i didnt even have to try these on, held them up and they were totally see through, will be returning."
2.0,Fits as Expected but the “cheetah print” was very cartoon like. Almost a purple orange look to it. Not very happy with this purchase.
2.0,I liked the product but it's made 2 sizes too small
2.0,"Received not as described. It's most definitely rose gold, completely different from Gold. I needed Gold color and I needed today. Too bad. I really do not appreciate wrong descriptions. I attached a photo,  hard to tell, but it's pink. Ugh!😑"
2.0,Was a nice ring for a few weeks. It lasted about 3 weeks passed my wedding day. This evening my wife noticed the center section had clouded up. It's some kind of clear apoxy like plastic and it just looks horrible . I purchased it about 2 weeks  before my wedding so it is passed the return period. Time to hunt for a new ring
2.0,Shorts were too small.
2.0,"I like the necklace, however it’s tarnished!  I need another cloth just to try and clean it as directed.  My fingers and now the chain are dirty too.  You can see the chain in my second picture.  Very disappointed that my husband paid a lot of money for something this tarnished right out of the bag.  And in trying to clean it, the chain and my fingers are dirty because the cloth isn’t big enough to clean the necklace properly.  For the price he paid, I’d think he’d get a better product."
2.0,These are so tiny🤦🏼‍♀️ They fit because they stretch far- but then they’re just super thin.
2.0,"Wrap is quite pretty, but is not what I ordered. Picture shows baguette stones in both rows, wrap has round cuts (spaced far apart and quite unevenly) in primary level. Not the look I wanted with my teardrop. Rating pending vendor response."
2.0,Poor quality and incorrect colod.
2.0,Poor quality but look attractive
2.0,"The padding in the front is too lumpy, and the fit of the bra is too tight in the back and too lose on the sides/front. The box was also very badly smashed. Overall, it seemed like a very poor quality item not worth its price. I wouldn't recommend buying this sports bra."
2.0,Cute dress but the white lining fabric is too tight and the length is too short to wear as a dress but with leggings and a sweater it may work. It has a zipper back and 3 buttons at the back of the neck. Hard to zip by yourself.
2.0,Was loose in all the wrong places wich is odd because im very chest heavy iv never returned a tlitem before but i just may with this one becuase it didnt hit the mark at all.
2.0,Shirt runs big. I ordered large because I like my shirts loose. This is to loose. shirt isn't cotton. Feels like spandex. I'm not a fan. Returning.
2.0,This wallet doesn't open up far enough for easy access and the credit card slots are quite small. My insurance ID cards don't fit at all.
2.0,So tiny! Too tiny!
2.0,"Top is way too big, bottoms are way too small. All wrong."
2.0,Way to small for a 2X
2.0,"This dress runs big and I'm a size small and I ordered a small, I had to take it to a Taylor to get it adjusted but the back was unadjustable for some reason."
2.0,I bought this because I lost a ball on my current septum. This is not internally threaded. The ball screws onto the horseshoe.
2.0,They last about 3 wearings before they start to fall apart.  The material is super thin and not durable at all.
2.0,"I have many homeyee dresses that I love but unfortunately, this didn't end up being one of them. First thing is that the sizing of this dress is not in line with the sizing of most of homeyee's dresses and that's probably my fault for assuming it would be since this is a different material. It runs larger than other dresses I have. The dress has no stretch and is very thin, almost gauzy. The fact that it is unlined makes it unwearable. You can't wear a slip because the slit is so high in the front.  The v-neck is deep but without any stretch, the neckline just gapes. So there really isn't a way to wear this without drastically altering it with safety pins or fabric tape. If it were a true wrap dress that is open at the front, this dress might work out better.  I'm really sad this didn't work out because with some changes, it would be a beautiful dress."
2.0,"I bought the large because of its supposed correspondence to a US size 0-2. My waist is 25.5 inches and all of my US-made clothing are sizes 0-2. These pants however, dropped off my waist and would've had to have been taken in at least 2 inches to fit properly. Only giving two stars because the quality was nice, but I returned them."
2.0,The style is exactly as shown but the metal pieces were very tarnished and the item is brand new. The class also fell off within the first hour. The band is really leather though and smells like heaven.
2.0,I’ve had this less than 24 hours and it is already broken. Would not stay in place when I would slide the band into its slot…the center piece has broken out of it. Very disappointing.
2.0,"Design and cut as expected, runs small. So small."
2.0,Very nice but the clip fell off!
2.0,The emblem is much smaller than expected and the chain was very weak. Broke after 4 days of wearing.
2.0,"Love the look of the dress but it fits a bit too small. I wish that Amazon made it clearer where the manufacturers are located because the variation in size can be quite substantial. What seems like a valid comparison chart may not work out in the design of the outfit. From here on, I will stick to American brands because the sizing is truer to this country."
2.0,I ordered a 2xl and it fit like a medium...the fit was way off and not as I expected
2.0,I like the outfit.pants fit well.Top is slightly tight on the arms.I had to go one size up.It runs small.material is very thin.looks exactly like the picture.
2.0,Not very comfortable. Will wear around the house but not to workout in.
2.0,I returned it. It doesn't look good on a small person.
2.0,To be honest it looked nothing like it was pictured. I got a size small and I’m normally a medium on top. It was HUGE. I couldn’t even wear it for my reception because it was so see-thru.
2.0,"I purchased them for my husband and they work well. The only problem I am having now is that each time I wash them, they are falling apart. They unravel when washed which is not good."
2.0,Package came as was damaged. Item looks used.
2.0,"Bought for my 11 yr old son for an event he likes to dress up & he also likes cool clothes, he loved the way it looked & felt but upon putting it on he said there's a hole in it, the stitching in the crotch of the pants was en frayed & coming apart needless to say he was really disappointed & since we didn't have the time to try to return or exchange it & when I ordered it had said 1 left in the size we ended up having to take it to a tailor shop to get it fixed"
2.0,Seem through material
2.0,"I tried the pajama jeans on and they were too long and didn't fit at all in the waist.  I got them to my sister, and I hope she's able to wear them."
2.0,Kind of cheap quality and didn't stay on the glasses. It also made me look like an old Granny...not the look I was going for.
2.0,Bottom tiny tiny and top too big with no support.
2.0,The nose piece broke the first day.
2.0,Too small. Order size bigger.
2.0,"Good quality when you initially receive it but durability is 1/10 at best.  Corners started wearing out with less than 2 months of use.  &#34;Leather&#34; (It's bottom quality leather) started pealing off around 2 months.  The case will eventually have trouble gripping on to the phone.  This caused the phone to slip out and dropped my phone cracking the screen.<br /><br />As a case protector, it has good back protection but atrocious front protection.  The phone screen will take all of the impact.  When the phone is face down on a desk, the screen will completely touch the desk.<br /><br />As a card holder, it is great.  Easy to add and remove cards from the back.  Can fit 2 cards, maybe 3 but will have some difficulty removing the cards as it will be a tight fit.  Hence the 2 stars out of 5 instead of just 1.<br /><br />Based on durability alone, this product is a HARD PASS.  Plenty of alternatives out there that can hold cards, offer good protection, and last longer.  Not worth the money."
2.0,Fabric gave me a rash
2.0,"I kept losing the clasp on my original band so I got this. The buckle definitely helped with that issue, though the band that holds the strap in place broke after just a few wears. :("
2.0,It looks pretty and is warm. But the quality of manufacturing is very poor. I bought this last year and it didn’t even make it through the winter. I had to purchase a different hat and scarf just to make it through the winter.
2.0,Didn’t fit correctly around the center arch area of the shoe.
2.0,It was very cute but the ring loop opened way to easy.  Keys would pop off to easily.  Not a good buy.
2.0,"I bought because I got permanent contact lenses surgicaly implanted into my eyes and since then it's been hard for me to drive at night do to bad halos and glare so I tried these and if I'm in a well lit area at night it makes every thing just slightly worst but if I'm on a dark back road they seem to help just a tad. I havnt driven in a night rain, we'll see how they do"
2.0,Not good for plus size
2.0,"Super cheap dress, doesn’t look like the picture like at all"
2.0,You need a slender neck for this one. Oh well. Just not for me.
2.0,"Way, way too big. The L fit like a 2X. It was also a very heavy material."
2.0,"I originally loved it, but after 2 months it started tarnishing."
2.0,My wife had a very hard time with this band. It seems way too heavy to stay connected to the watch. The clips that connect to the watch come disconnected with no reason.
2.0,"This is perfect if you like the larger face its perfect for me. Don't notice wearing it it's so comfortable and so far no stains or yellowing. Very pleased. Edit- 2 months to the day and either the battery is dead or the watch is, not sure. Unfortunately I've only worn it a couple of times. Very disappointed and sadly I really like the watch but a battery will cost almost as much as a replacement. SAD."
2.0,These bras feel like they are made out of the itchiest material on earth .. nothing like an itchy bra to make for a long day at work . There is a protrusion in the middle of the cup.. not a good look.
2.0,I personally did see a benefit from this but I know other swear by these. Plus it turned my are green.
2.0,Too large and I am disappointed I am not able to brag about a good deal I got.
2.0,"I ordered a large,  even though I usually wear a medium, and I returned it because it was too tight."
2.0,"it was shipped fairly quickly which was a plus. however, we never really got it to work :/ everything else about the product was fine. it fit great and the material was nice. just wish it worked"
2.0,"It's works great as long as you are going really slow. Make sure you have a lid, My drink spilt everywhere when I took off."
2.0,Way too big compared to the ones in the same size we bought at Sports A.
2.0,Sweater swallows me. Fabric is scratchy.
2.0,Color of sweats does not match. They’re not pastel or vibrant but instead very muted and much darker.
2.0,"Although the price is great, they're  not all the same fabric. The pink, grey, and white one all are a suade material which will be too hot to put on her this summer. Living in Arizona, it's already hot, if she fits into them in a couple months they'll be too hot to wear. The knot on it is also very big and pointy. More for girls than to have babies wear."
2.0,Ordered 2x and it was too big. However the colour is nice and the material feels comfortable
2.0,"I was not impressed by the printed/painted pattern, or the leather quality. Returned strap as it did not meet my quality standards"
2.0,It came apart
2.0,"Wow. The reviews about this being incredibly small are absolutely correct. I usually wear a L, ordered an XXL and couldn't even get this on. Body is a cotton-like knit and the arms are a thin nylon-type, with almost zero stretch. Good bless Amazon and their easy returns!"
2.0,I love how you can dress it up or dress it down the only problem is when you wash it the vibes wear off the dress mine doesn’t say good vibe anymore less then a year
2.0,didn't like.
2.0,It’s nice looking but in terms of the material..well you get what you pay for
2.0,This going to be a gift for my husband but it was too small so I had to return it. And I don't think it would have lasted long anyway. It was just too thin.
2.0,They fit well and looked really good but they broke in half about an hour into wearing them
2.0,"I ordered an XL and it fits so tight like a Large or possibly a Medium, quality isn’t great, but the print is vibrant and beautiful."
2.0,These were shipped in a BAG with a heavy metal tool! The box that the gloves go in was all crushed and scratched . I was hoping to give as a gift with the box but it looked terrible. The gloves I ordered were medium but seemed more like a small.
2.0,Pills after first delicate cold water wash.  Wouldn't recommend buying this top.
2.0,"Cute set and so cheap, but pretty much every bracelet has broken on the first day of wearing."
2.0,Not adequate for Covid-19 protection
2.0,"They push into my face around the eyes, it's too uncomfortable for me to use. I think I like the sleep masks that lay flat better then the kind with the recessed eye area. For what they are they seems to be very good quality."
2.0,"These are not waterproof. Fell a bunch of times learning to snowboard and I was soaked by the end of the day. Needless to say, the ride home was very uncomfortable."
2.0,"There are many things I like about this skirt, so I'm sad to have to return it and rate it so low.  On the &#34;pro&#34; side, it's a beautiful color (I got the teal, which is a deep, rich hue), and I really like the feel and weight of the material.  The fabric was much heavier/thicker than I expected, and it's a great weight for a skirt, so that was a pleasant surprise.  The size was also more or less what I expected - slightly smaller than standard U.S. plus sizes, but pretty good, definitely wearable.  On the &#34;con&#34; side, though, are two things that I can't stand.  The first is that that lovely, heavy, drapey fabric is INCREDIBLY static-prone!  Even after dousing it with static guard, it was sticking to my legs, the couch, door frames as I walked through them, the fridge... oof!  And second, the front was a little longer than the back, which, when combined with the fact that my butt sticks out so that even skirts with even hems already end up longer in the front, meant that I ended up with a mid-shin-length skirt in the front, and a knee-length skirt in back.  So, with disappointment, I'm sending this one back."
2.0,Big and very thin knit.
2.0,Buckle the cowboy and gold part in the middle is completely crooked.
2.0,"These are very pretty and a nice big size without being too big, but there's not enough tension in the spring-back clasp, and they slide right off. I tried bending them a little more closed, and that helped enough to make them wearable (although I have to catch and replace them hourly)...but doesn't compensate enough for the lack of tension."
2.0,Thier idea of size varies from others.
2.0,"Came pretty fast however the light only functions on one side. The light that is on, is half dead.  Unable to read in low light. Basically useless half of the day."
2.0,Very upset .... does not look like the picture and very small and cheap
2.0,"Bought the bra a couple of months ago and I was so thrilled with the comfort I recommended it to all my friends.  But now, after handwashing and taking care of the item, the straps continually slip down my shoulders and when I bend forward, my boobs fall out of the cups! Not cool."
2.0,Draw string serves no purpose on and neither does the elastic.
2.0,While many stated this product was long enough and checking the lengths they would have fit but found them to be shorter than advertised when wearing.  I ordered up a size based on previous feedback as well.
2.0,This is the size of an earring thought it was a little bigger. Very disappointed
2.0,The material is sucky and itchy. Also mine was a bit asymmetrical. It definetly did not look like what is pictures but maybe is juat not for me...tried it one wore it for an hour and couldnt deal with it..Im too lazy to return it but I thought about it.
2.0,Wouldn’t stay up at all:(
2.0,Too large on top
2.0,These boots arrived a little larger than a normal size 4. My daughter still was able to wear them. After minimal wear one of the bows has fallen off. She still wears them but it’s disappointing they didn’t last an entire season.
2.0,These headbands are really cute but fall apart so easily. My daughter has only wore 2 of them so far and BOTH of them had problems. The knot came off of 1 of them and the stitching is ripped on the other one.
2.0,"These are NOT sunglasses - useless for me outside. They are barely tinted so if you are trying to find SUNGLASSES that are readers, look elsewhere."
2.0,"I was very gentle with both cases, and they both broke within 2-3 days. Very sad. So sad. Many crys. A la chingada!"
2.0,It fits fine and is stretchy. The fabric resembles the quick dry fabric in my outdoor clothing. It's odd for a blazer to be made of this fabric. I'm not really a fan. It doesn't look or feel good for work situations.
2.0,They are definitely not it true to size. Tear easily but they were cheap enough. Won't purchase from this seller again.
2.0,"Huge! I ordered a medium and I am 5'3&#34;, 130lbs. It looked like bad curtains. The shoulders could have fit football pads underneath and the hemline was mid-calf."
2.0,"If you need a pair for one job, It’s an adequate safety goggle, it works, but the sides are not transparent. It’s frosted and that bothers me. The peripheral vision is bad. I would not buy this again. It would drive me crazy to use this on a regular basis."
2.0,These bracelets are very cute but the end clasp are poorly made and scratch up my wrist. I tried fixing them but do not have the correct tools.
2.0,Way too big. I measured myself to their guidelines and sizing is not correct. Sent back for refund.
2.0,The dress it’s self is fine and fits good but it does seems like kind of cheap material but for a casual day it’s fine. My problem with it is that the print on it looks blurry. I was expecting you to be able to see the flowers that are on it but they just seem like blurry blobs
2.0,Just wrong. The cut is way off unless you have really high hip bones.
2.0,Tight across the shoulders and wide around the middle. I normally wear a 6P coat and ordered a medium. Just not for me - going back.
2.0,"doesn't stay in place, however ,very cute."
2.0,"Not a fan of these. They are really unflattering and just look weird on. I felt like they were way too short for me and I’m only 5’4”, so if you are about 5’3” or taller, you will probably have the same issue. I tried to post a photo showing the length but it’s not a great representation. I must have been leaning a bit because when I put them on, the bottom of the pants leg hits about an inch or two above the top of my shoe. They look almost like they were supposed to be Capri pants that were just a bit long. There are also pockets on the side of the legs that look awful. I’m a nurse and love having cargo style scrub pants but these pockets are so strange. The flap at the top of the pocket is HUGE and sticks out and just looks really ugly. Fortunately, they are comfortable, so I will be able to wear them around the house."
2.0,"This is such a cute shirt, but the girl in the pic must be 12 years old.  After checking the feedback, I got an XL.  It's way too short of a cut, so I'll be trying to stretch it out on first wash."
2.0,"I love the style of this purse, but the silver tab that keeps the zipper from coming off broke and shortly after that the zipper came off. I need to return it and I'm sad."
2.0,"The material on the top is not great. It's more of a nylon but, the bottom is cute though. Overall, I don't care for this dress in fit or material. Because this was a third party purchase, I have to pay to return. I contacted the seller and was asked to send photos in other to return. Just to difficult, hopefully I can cut it and  just make it into a skirt."
2.0,"I love the idea of this watch band, however it does not stay tight. It loosens up very easily and quickly. Disappointed!!!"
2.0,"Bought this to have as a face covering and excited to see a Beastie Boys design. Unfortunately, the day it arrived was the day it was all over the news that neck gaiters are worse than not wearing a mask at all :("
2.0,The sizing was way off on the small side and this reeked of chemicals.  I returned it
2.0,Some didn't have eye holes cut out but arrived sealed and quickly as expected.<br /><br />I probably will spend an extra couple of bucks next time for higher quality masks as these were really low quality.
2.0,My only problem is that the turquoise dress really isn’t turquoise. The color I needed for my wedding was more blue and when I received the dress it was more green. Beautiful dress other than that but it doesn’t match what I need so I’m sending it back for another color.
2.0,"This face mask didn’t work for me. Thing is barely breathable! Fabric really pulls close to your nose when inhaling, and if you add the filter, makes breathing through it more difficult. In terms of looks, it is really cool. In terms of functionality, it really sucks!"
2.0,"Product is alright, first time I wore them the strings already started coming undone."
2.0,"""you pay for what you get"" applies here. Cheap price and a cheap product. The color fades very fast, within a week the red ""paint"" faded away.<br />Also sizing was way off. Had to order three different times to get the right size.<br />Not very comfortable or form fitting, very simply made and feels that way."
2.0,These are made very cheap.  Material is very thin.  Wish i hadn’t ordered them.
2.0,I love this longer fit and it’s very warm but the zipper is metal and very sharp teeth on it!!  I wouldn’t buy it again!
2.0,Not too happy with the product.  Nothing like shown in the pictures. No luster or shine at all. And kinda bent ad crooked. Wish it had a bit more shine to it.
2.0,"Th pants are baggy and the entire outfit feels of cheap material.  The product fits lose, be whatever the material is, is uncomfortable."
2.0,"I've bought this type of bra couple of times (Cabales) but they were out, so I tried this brand. Much inferior, the fabric is thin and too stretchy. The inserts feel really cheap and keep poking out the top. I loved the last ones, these are pretty terrible, unless you just want them to sleep in."
2.0,Very cute but 2 of the 3 bracelets broke the first time they were worn. The string is very thin. Pearls everywhere.
2.0,Great top!But not for 66 yr old.☹️
2.0,"I thought I would be able to just click and have it open, didn't work like that.  In fact, after I pushed it open, it was very difficult to catch and stay open.  Also, the design is only on the inside.  I got the sunflower -- sunflower inside, black outside.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"The fit was a little bit small and short, but I expected that. I'm 5'11"" tall and usually about a 14. Since I'm nursing at the moment everything is tight in the chest I could not even zip this dress up all the way. The reason I bought this was that I thought it was a real wrap dress and that it would give me the freedom to make adjustments where I needed (i.e. my bust which is normally a 38 B/C, but is currently a 38 D)."
2.0,"They were smaller than even some of the kids faces, and would nit stuck to the skin"
2.0,"I really liked this bag until I realized that one of the pockets had come loose from the stitching.<br />This pocket was the one in front that the top part of the buckle is attached to.<br />I lost the contents of that pocket without knowing it. Once I discovered that they were gone, I looked but I never found them."
2.0,"it is a cute boot but it was too tight. I wear a 7 1/2, and I decided to go up an 8 when ordering.... never again"
2.0,Pretty but too large.
2.0,Although pretty - very ilfitted. Covers almost entire face and hard to breathe with it on. Just all around bad.
2.0,"nice dress, doesn't fit, so not as expected.  Asked to return and shipper was agreeable and helpful.  BUT postage was $75 at my expense so not worth it to me.  I will donate it somewhere."
2.0,Didn't pay a lot. Sleeves too long and fabric flimsy.
2.0,It didn’t fit and had to pay for return when I thought it was free. Ready for return was XL was way to big.  I reordered in large
2.0,Shoes don’t look as expected at this price point. Poor workmanship. Lots of bumps and you can see where they were glued together. I am returning these.
2.0,"Fits ok but the color is nothing like what picture shows , very disappointed"
2.0,The clasp was fused together- I will have to replace it. It doesn't open.
2.0,"Pants are thin, shirt I liked the color but when u put it on collar doesn't lay flat around the neck area, so it looks like u put your shirt on backwards."
2.0,"Material is very, very flimsey"
2.0,The jewelry fell apart but I still have the beagle clasp that I love!
2.0,They looked nice initially but the stitches started showing up with gaps after wearing it few times
2.0,"Cute, but when it arrived it only had one pocket...lol. The other one was stitched together."
2.0,I replaced a Casio F-108WH which died with this watch. It is much smaller and to read. It looks more a ladies watch.
2.0,THEY ARE SOMEWHAT SMALL
2.0,Has the band for three days and the paint is coming off the metal buckle and the metal bands.
2.0,These seem to be well made but it was too small/tight for my head to wear it comfortably. I tried to stretch it out but to no avail. When I bought this item I thought it would have 2 headbands....it's only 1. For the price I feel like I got ripped.....since I can't wear it comfortably it's a total loss for me. If your head ain't that big then it would definitely work for you but only 1 band for the price....meh.
2.0,the necklace is pretty. The chain broke the first time it was worn. for a $45.00 necklace.  The chain shouldn't have broke so easily.  Making a different necklace for the pendant.
2.0,Ising for dusting
2.0,The magnets in the band not that strong so my watch comes off the arm all time.
2.0,Color very very dull and muted. Shipped from China and took over a month. Disappointed.
2.0,Way too large and weird material
2.0,Very cheap one broke hopefully the others day
2.0,"Even following the instructions, color does not hold up."
2.0,Color not all like the picture. A dull ugly RED. Nice material and very roomy.  I am giving it away.  Very disappointed as there were such good reviews.
2.0,"I ordered my son a 3X which was absurd because he wears a L/XL, but I went according to the size chart, turns out it was TOO SMALL! Their sizing is waaayyyy offfff!!!"
2.0,"I'm very disappointed in this dress. Cheap material, Not made good, Doesn't fit right, The Split Is Overlapped way to much where it doesn't open when you walk."
2.0,Very cheap quality and not flattering at all
2.0,I was to big .I normally wears a large but I read the reviews and decided  to order a size down but I should order 2 size down
2.0,I don’t even use it.  It’s so small my hair doesn’t fit in
2.0,"Too small, material very pj feeling. For my girlfriend tho"
2.0,It’s extra small. I think it’s for kids. I’m a normal 5’5“ woman and my hands are not that big. I squeezed my hand and tried to use it and it’s broken. Not sure if I still can return 😔
2.0,"This thing is cute, and good quality for a swimsuit. However, it's tiny. I ordered a large, normally wear a size 8-10 dress, am 5'2 and weigh 150. According to the size chart this should have even been a little big, but I trusted the previous reviewer and ordered a size up. I can get it on but it squeezes the hell out of me so I look like a pack of sausages. I've been losing weight so maybe in another 15 pounds it will actually fit."
2.0,Earrings are fine just too big for my personal taste.
2.0,"Thought I'd try out VenActive compression socks. They are $20 less expensive than another brand I purchased. I purchased a large pair, as I had the other brand. My calf and ankle are large, and large comes up just below the knee. My foot is a size 15. Thought I'd try to save a few bucks: but, the VenActive socks don't expand enough to fit my foot. I wore them 1 day, and they were uncomfortable. Can't wear them again. Now I know."
2.0,"The shoes started peeling withing the first hour I wore them. They are cute, but learned my lesson the cheap material."
2.0,Well cute fit nice but to thin to be worn out and about as a dress.  Maybe a cover up for a swim suit.
2.0,I have only washed it three times and it's already getting pilliy and shrank a little.  I would not buy again
2.0,"Don't stay on very well, slide down.  I followed the sizing guide however they seem too big.  Pockets are too deep and I NEVER say that!  Very soft fabric though."
2.0,Lens's are clear and the finish is nice but they don't fit that well in the frames. They can be installed but they don't contact the frame along the top edge. You have to be very delicate when cleaning them or they will pop out of the frame without much force. If you drop them the lens's are poping out. Better fit and they would have been 5 stars.
2.0,They’re quite small and the finishing is terrible. We received the mittens with a lot of loose threads and the material quality isn’t that great either. I guess the price was a bit too good to be true for what they showed.
2.0,Super thin. A step above nylons.
2.0,"Fits like a size smaller, and thin material."
2.0,"VERY SHORT and SEE-THROUGH. you can even see nude undergarments through it, that's how thin it is!!"
2.0,"The pins pictured are not the pins you receive. I got about 4 good ones out of the 20. Mostly Asian themed, nurses (I am not in the medical field) some bondage and naked ladies.... I probably would not buy again. I bought this soley for the Pokemon pins and they were not a part of the set."
2.0,"I love how cute these are. However, the little animals break off to easily. I thought maybe it was the first one we were to rough, then we got to the next one.. it also broke. Now the return time has passed and 3/5 little animals are broken. Disappointed."
2.0,"Didn't go with my skin tone, and it was way too small."
2.0,"You get what you pay for, the painting on the mushroom was incredibly off and poorly done."
2.0,"NICE AS A REGULAR T, BUT NOT AS A COMPRESSION SHIRT."
2.0,Great looking belt but have an issue with the locking mechanism. Randomly unbuckles itself.
2.0,Really paid too much.
2.0,"It seems to be good quality, but is too small."
2.0,Necklace arrived with several pearls out of the setting. Not the best quality. Returning both pieces.
2.0,The color was not as expected. It was almost white. Pretty disappointed. The chain that came with the bag was very cheap as well.
2.0,I got these because the Locs I have had previously were very dark. I was hoping these would be as well. They were not much darker than dime store glasses. I am disappointed.
2.0,These are great gloves to work with however they bleed pink so if you wear them whether your hands are getting wet or not they bleed pink.
2.0,"I love the idea and it looks like what I want, but the slit in the back is too high... just below my butt.  Had I sewn the slit even a little bit, I wouldn't be able to move in it."
2.0,"Item is nice quality and works well with my garmin; however, ordered black and received a copper color.  Box said black.  I kept because I needed as I broke my old one and was desperate."
2.0,Its cute but I could have used a longer top.. it seemed a bit short.
2.0,"Just like somebody else wrote, after just one use on a short business trip, the adjusting telescope handle stopped functioning on the 24&#34; piece. I had to push my luggage around without a useable handle. I have owned several pieces of luggage thru out my life and never had issues, so when I received this I threw away the box. Amazon requires that  I box it up to send back. To go out and find an appropriate size box to fit this in is difficult, expensive and time consuming. I tried a locker and there are many in Los Angeles, but the closest locker with room was 40 minutes away. Frustrating is an understatement. I am grateful this did not happen on one of my overseas trips. I am not sure what is wrong with their manufacturing that these handles stop functioning with very little use. I tried to call Coolife directly, but sadly, I could not find any customer service number on the internet for this company. Beyond frustrating."
2.0,THE leaf necklace looks nothing like the one in the picture... the necklace is the reason I ordered this
2.0,"Its cute that why I gave it 2 stars. I missed my window for return or I would have. Hard to get over your head,<br />I have a normal size head, hat size 6 &7/8th. Tight on the neck, no drape. Really disappointed."
2.0,These pants are very thin and see through!
2.0,"Even when you order something bigger than you need, it still ends up being too small.  I might end up cutting it and making it a cami..  Love the material just not the fit."
2.0,If you order one of these order one size larger. I bought one brought it to work with me without trying it on and it was way too small. Very uncomfortable day to say the least.
2.0,Item too small and uncomfortable.  Not really great material in my opinion.
2.0,The hat is cute but with how the lights and the tubing is connected it can come off. Half of the hats lights just fell after 1 wearing inside for 15 minutes. I had to sew the tube back onto the hat. I would not have spent money on something I would need to fix later. You want to buy a product that doesn't need to be fixed in the first place.
2.0,The &#34;key chain&#34; that this came with was just a silver chain.  It was garbage.
2.0,"the cord is fine but the adhesive holding the rubber ends on did not hold up,  seemed really nice at 1st but after a couple weeks of use each pair started coming apart lost one expensive pair of sunglasses do to this issue."
2.0,It would have been better if it wouldn't have broken
2.0,Cheap and much shorter than pictured
2.0,Difficult to latch the back
2.0,"Ordered white gloves.  Package is marked white, but gloves are beige at best.  They fit nice but they aren't the color I ordered."
2.0,"I thought somehow it would be cotton, but its a silky material that is impossible to wear with eyeglasses.  My glasses literally slide right off my face with this mask.  So sad because the pattern is beautiful."
2.0,The &#34;embroidery&#34; began peeling off the shirt the second time I wore it. The fabric clings in an unflattering manner.
2.0,They are nice when they want to work. After a few steps they are slipping to the side and the fishnet part ends up under your feet instead of on top. And end up ripping if they get betwen your toes.
2.0,It's made of the form fitting polyester so it's very itchy & hot. Since it's short & ripped it's made for summer but it's too hot really wear.
2.0,I like the frame but the glasses do not block the sun in the least.
2.0,The crotch runs very low and waist runs big. I have my belt cinched all the way down and I have to constantly pull them up. They were also a little long on the length as well.
2.0,"Dangle piece does not last, the ring that holds it to the solid piece is too flimsy"
2.0,I'm 5'4 and 169lbs. I bought a medium. I would either have to be taller or get a smaller size for any portion of this dress to fit right and cover the correct spots. Every strap is too loose and bunches up
2.0,It gives no tummy control. The stitching in the outside is very cheaply done and very noticeable. (It shows on the picture on the shoulders and it has it on the sides)
2.0,Nothing really wrong. Just not the style for me
2.0,Not a true size 8 order half size up
2.0,"They hurt going in because of the ball on the end. They were a little on the shorter side as well. It served its purpose as I bought it to wear while having my c-section. I probably won’t need them again. Overall, shipping was quick and the product was as described."
2.0,"It is see through. The picture is misleading, it is not going to add for modesty or warmth as far as office environments are concerned."
2.0,Mecánicamente igual al original pero la durabilidad muy regular. La original es muy costosa y casi que es preferible comprar un nuevo reloj. Casio debería ser más consecuente con el precio de los repuestos.
2.0,Ots ok for the price  we paid
2.0,Sent back - I will not buy from this vendor poor description of item.
2.0,too much going on for the teenager we gave this too
2.0,Didn’t love the fabric but always easy to return!!
2.0,"Not very durable the string wore and snapped in less than a month, disappointed."
2.0,Huge and strange cut. Ordered a medium and it came as an XXL with a M tag..... returned!
2.0,"Loved the look, for great and the color was perfect. Completely see through tho so won’t be able to wear unless it’s over a swim suit or something. Don’t recommend"
2.0,Super cute bad... quality not so much. Fell apart in less than a month of having used the purse.
2.0,Good product But XXL fits like an M. Possibly Asian Fit or something as it did ship from China.
2.0,"The plastic bag came ripped up, and the white stains won't even wash off. Looks like it was a returned item or something. I have no time for a return now so I'm just going to keep it but honestly was disappointed."
2.0,These run small. They are shipped from China so if you go to return them they will offer only a certain percent of your money back to keep them. If I had known this I wouldn’t have ordered them. I’ve run into this trap before.
2.0,"Did not work for me, even though it says A/B and I'm a B, this is more for a very small A size. Bummer, the look was really nice."
2.0,The picture make it look larger
2.0,They were fine until they were washed and then they became to small and misshapen.  The colours are lovely though.
2.0,Too short and huge waste. Thought they would be cozier. Too expensive for the end product.
2.0,"I returned this dress. It was very cheaply made of inferior fabric, and essentially see-through."
2.0,I had these for all of a day before the elastic button loop broke. I should have returned them. Sad face manufacturer.
2.0,"I thought this was a great find because we lost 4 family members recently and this would represent them.  I loved the design and was so excited to get it.  But when I wore it, the hearts started to move around and hang in different directions, and it no longer looked like 4 hearts, just a jumbled mess.  I considered putting a dab of glue on each heart to hold it in place but thought that might discolor the stainless steel.  Going to be returned."
2.0,"I received this watch just today and although it’s appearance is beautiful and as expected, the clasp mechanism on the back is a completely useless piece of junk. My significant other and I have both spent the greater part of 3 hours trying to adjust the strap and get the clasp to shut with no luck. If the clasp doesn’t shut on day one, I can’t see the product enduring time either. Not worth the money."
2.0,One size does NOT fit all.  Too small for my husband.
2.0,"I ordered this hat for me, not my Grandsons!  When it came - it was youth size.  I can barely get it on my head.  I just went back to look at the order - I see no reference to youth size.  A ripoff!"
2.0,These are super cheaply made. The back is so hard and feels like cheap plastic. The ASICS logo on the side is cheap hard plastic THATS like free hanging detached from the shoe in parts. I’ve worn ASICS for 15 years and never seen such garbage! I don’t know how anyone would walk around a Disney park in them! DO BETTER ASICS!
2.0,The pocket has plastic/polyester material in it as I asked the seller but it is not mentioned here. So sad that pocket is like that otherwise the other parts seems like good comfortable cotton.
2.0,"One size does not fit all, the gloves were too small for me.  Fits most people is an understatement. However, I gave them to one of my lodge members who was able to wear them."
2.0,"Nice quality, however way too small"
2.0,Too short for women sized 8.5
2.0,"These are too stretchy, apparently for someone 6ft tall as well.  They won’t stay above my knees and they are way too long even if they fit in the right place!  Pure aggravation."
2.0,This apron is not sky blue; it’s dark teal. I’m disappointed but I don’t have time to order another one.
2.0,I wanted it since it was different and loves the color. With in two weeks of not even constant wear the sparkles peeled off the band. Not worth the price.
2.0,If your looking for delicate!!!! This is the anklet for you. Much much to thin for a ankle bracelet. Fast shipping
2.0,"Really thin and not worth it at all , I return it"
2.0,Purchased the &#34;C&#34; cup which seems more like and A or B.  Tiny!  Heavily padded cups - which is not needed for C cups.
2.0,"Loose in some spots, fit in others. Not cute. Came with a snag. Dont hold you in like others. Made me feel fatter."
2.0,"2 stars because:<br />- arrived looking old and worn, the colors are faded and black looks washed out. The white polka dots don't look like a clean white<br />- the ruffles curl inside out. You would have to iron after each wash for them to stay because the way they are sewn, they will curl<br />- the material is cheap looking. Like that of a stretchy tank top, not worth the price<br /><br />This is only me perhaps, but I am size small and find that this dress does not strech well for women with larger breasts that are size small. It fit well at the waist.<br />I will likely wear it at home, but I am very dissatisfied. The picture is touched up because it looks very cheap in person."
2.0,"Fits a little strange, the body is nice and flowy but the arms are quite long and tight. It is a very light knit, more of a summer weight sweater."
2.0,I didn't like the fit on my
2.0,Cheappppp
2.0,It is not sterling silver.  It started rusting.
2.0,The clasp doesn't stay shut; really poor quality. Can't use them for fear of the clasp/clip coming open.
2.0,I ordered 2 different thermals and this one does not seem to feel as warm as the Rocky thermal. I work in a 40 degree room and I wear jeans over the thermals and I kind of feel a chill on my legs when I walk in the room more than the Rocky. with the Tesla The Tesla does not have an opening to go to the bathroom but the Rocky does have one which makes it easier. Both do run small  so order one size up. Not bad but I would not get this brand again.
2.0,"This should not be labeled as a Men's watch. Even though it just barely fit, it looked tiny on my thin wrist. I gave it to my 7 year old son and it looked just right. This is a junior's or child's watch."
2.0,Bought this early September. This work just fine for about a month. Now I have to be very careful because it will pop out at the most random times. Will not buy again.
2.0,Broke easily and color is fading
2.0,Arms are very snug in comparison to the rest of the dress which is quite roomy below waist.  Not a good fit.  I will try to return.
2.0,"Fit is very awkward, and material feels cheap. After one wash I'm unhappy with how the material is holding up. Very tight around waist and thighs, while baggy around calves"
2.0,The slit isn't noticeable unless you hold it open with your hand. Unfortunately it also arrived broken as the straps are like bra straps with adjustable pieces and they're made out of thin plastic which was cracked so the strap wasn't even attached. That'd be totally fine if I wanted to let one boob hang out free :)
2.0,FOR BEST FIT YOU NEED TO ORDER HALF SIZE BIGGER. HAD TO GIVE AWAY SINCE THEY DID NOT FIT COMFORTABLY.
2.0,"Really wanted to love these, but unfortunately they looked very cheap in person. The gem part of the stud looked like sometihng you would buy at the dollar store, rather than costume jewelery."
2.0,IT was way to big and the quality was not what I expected. Much to thin.
2.0,"I'm normally size small. I ordered medium due to customers review this sweater rans very small, medium is way to tight."
2.0,The watch doesn't work on this product. If you want the style plan on getting a new battery as soon as you get it
2.0,"I wasn't looking for tight shorts, and I'm aware these are supposed to be comfortable and airy, but these shorts are humongous. I am of athletic build; I have big, muscular thighs, a muscular back side, and a small, but muscular waist. Basically, I'm not a waif by a long shot. I weigh 125 lbs, and I'm about 5'5&#34;. I ordered a small, because... I'm a small in everything, and these shorts are HUGE. I could practically put myself in one leg hole, and the waist is gigantic. Although there exists the ability to cinch the waist with the accompanying belt, nothing can be done for the billowing seat area that made my ample rear look non-existent as poofy fabric hid any detail of a body underneath. I will be returning. Hopefully, not all of Columbia's comfortable clothing is as excessive in sizing as these."
2.0,This was the most bizarre item ive ever ordered. No instructions only says ' fits with curve of womens body' -- or legs. I do not understand how to use this! Shkuld of bought ones that were already built in.
2.0,"Straps were too wide, didnt fit right, looked odd on foot."
2.0,Product was very small. It also smelled horrible. Like a mix of cigarettes and I don't know what else. I washed it and still couldn't get the smell out.
2.0,I am not pleased with this product.  I ordered in standard width.  It seems this shoe is very wide.  I feel unsteady when wearing it.  I am sorry I purchased this.
2.0,"I just received this device in the mail. It works, but the siren is not really that loud. Also, there are no instructions included about the device, like how to change the batteries.  I certainly would not recommend this item to anyone."
2.0,"Droopy cotton, not wool, and unflattering . You can find something better for the price"
2.0,"cut funny. really short in the mid drift,"
2.0,The material is poor quality and very sheer. You’ll have to wear a slip.
2.0,"Badly sewn, there was an awkward spot right in the front below the last button that didn’t match up and the color doesn’t match the picture well, it’s a brighter red"
2.0,This dress was WAY too big. I ordered a XS and I'm 5'1'' and it was very big. I even tried to shrink it in the wash with no success. I think the main issue was that the seam for the waist was off and that made the dress look awkwardly big. I was disappointed.
2.0,These run really too small
2.0,"The skirt is weird and stiff, and looks awkward on a larger sized (16) woman. Top was too big and loose. Missed the return window...not happy."
2.0,The product that came to me looked nothing like it did in the picture. It was a very dark purple. It is well put together but it’s not what I wanted!
2.0,Snagged within 15 mins. :( moved to another color and those snagged too. Low quality
2.0,"Nice potential, but extremely tight-fitting. I would only recommend buying these if you like really tight clothing."
2.0,"The material seems nice and sturdy, but the sizing is way off. My 2 ye old wears 2T, sometimes 3T so I got the toddler size. I honestly thought it would be too big since it's supposed to fit up to a 4, but it's really tight and digs into her shoulders. Now I'm heading to a dance store to buy a different size since the class is about to start. I'll be returning this one."
2.0,"The dress is cute, however, I'm not able to get out the wrinkles.  I've ironed it but the wrinkles come wright back"
2.0,"First off, I really like the black multi cam and the white multi cam pattern and that is why I purchased this mask. The actual mask material seem to be of decent quality but the stitching and finishing is horrendous. I don't know why you would use white threads for a black mask, which obviously shows at the bridge of the nose. The elastic earhoop is extremely poor quality and has weak elasticity. There is no way that these ear hoops will last. I took a gamble at purchasing the 4 pack with no reviews and lost. It feels like this mask was rushed. Would not recommend unless the manufacturer improves overall quality."
2.0,"this watch broke the day I received it in the mail. it was working until I strapped it on, then it broke. only reason it gets 2 stars is because it looks nice on your wrist, broken or working."
2.0,The knot and the string are weak which makes the whole product weak...why would you use expensive beads and go with horrible string that is weak plus the knot falling apart which can't hold the product together? 🤔
2.0,U get what u pay for...
2.0,Cons: It's worth about $15 to me -- not $35. It's thin and unlined. It's good to wear around the house -- I would not wear it if I were going somewhere.<br /><br />Pros: I like the pockets and hood and it's very comfortable.
2.0,It didn’t look like it was on the site when I receive it
2.0,Flattering but after less than 10 washes they now slip down during exercise. I find myself yanking them up constantly.
2.0,"Disappointed.<br />The color was pretty. The fabric seemed too thin to act as some sort of compression for athletic leggings although as regular leggins they would probably be comfortable. The tag said S/M but they were too loose and a bit baggy, especially around the bottom near my ankles.<br />My friends agreed they looked too loose so I ended up returning them. It's too bad they don't come in an actual SMALL"
2.0,This dress just made me look huge with how much tule there is and the way the sleeves laid. Was definitely not flattering.
2.0,"Great shirt, but sleeves were way too short."
2.0,"These are a pair of cheap sunglasses. Make no mistakes you do get what you pay for with these. Also, forget about the organge/red look the picture has... these are a lot more red in color and very feminine looking. Just keep that in mind."
2.0,"Bought this for my daughter as she is a year round competitive swimmer.<br />Got a great deal so gave it a try. She didn't like it at all! It was suppose to be Anti<br />Fog but she said she couldn't see very well,  didn't like the style too!"
2.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and skinny with a small chest, I ordered a large because it says this runs small. It's way too big for me, I probably could have ordered a small as usual. However the padding in the chest is ridiculous. They are like round circles that basically cover nipples but they stick way out and look so strange. You would have to remove them, but then the suit would be too thin to hide anything."
2.0,Cheaply made. Looks like a large sleep shirt. I still love it but it's not as nice as the picture. It's also very thin.
2.0,The pictures are filtered so the size to face ratio is off. I thought the frames were bigger. Cute glasses just not what I thought. Definitely a cat eye
2.0,I'm a very casual cyclist but these weren't durable enough even for my light usage. Got maybe a couple hundred miles of use out of them before they started falling apart.
2.0,"I wanted to like these but I ended up returning them. The overall look is nice and I think they would be warm in moderate cold climates. I ordered a size up based on the reviews and they were still too small. Also, the pair I received had a broken waist clasp and the overall feel of the material was cheap."
2.0,too short in the torso
2.0,too large even I following the size chart
2.0,It's a nice blouse but your sizes runs small
2.0,Was the size she wears but ran small. Was not happy with the purchase.
2.0,Would not consider this a “compression” garment
2.0,"This is a tiny huggie earrings and so people expecting it to be anything bigger will be disappointed. The diamond cut detail is very nice, adds shine. But the biggest problem is that it gave a bad skin reaction, it’s definitely not pure silver, very disappointed."
2.0,The necklace is absolutely gorgeous. But i started to get an allergic reaction. When I went to take the necklace off  there was black on my skin where the necklace had been. I am so disappointed!
2.0,"As others have said, a large number of the lights didn't work.  We bought them from the seller, Beety Home, and recommend you pick someone else.  Because they are contained in a small bag, a number of the lights get turned on before you recieve them and will no longer work as their batteries get all used up.  10 of the lights we received didn't work, and others were dim.  (I ordered these before, and didn't have this problem - maybe one or two didn't work then)."
2.0,"Okay so if you're slightly taller than average, these will be too short. Especially if you have any curve in your butt. After washing, they got even smaller. These will be fine if you're short or average. So yeah. If you're taller than average, these aren't the way to go"
2.0,"Is completely see through, you can see all your body through this dress you need something to put inside the dress"
2.0,"It was an Ok dress, but it was way too big, and I measured exactly the same as the XXL from the size chart. I would probably take a L, or maybe a XL. The color wasn't quite the same as the picture either, it was kind of a purple/red."
2.0,"With a very small wrist, I was excited to see this band offered in Extra-Small. Since there are virtually no watch bands for smaller wrists, I thought finally I had an option for a band that fit. Most bands either roll on your wrist, or the band is so long that even on the last hole it still sticks out.<br />So I attached the band to my Galaxy and within 2 hours it had already stretched and was loose and rolling on my wrist (see photos). It was disappointing, as the band is really attractive. So it's back to the UPS store."
2.0,"Fit a 300lb hourglass 42DDD 24/46 frame. The issue is in construction. The top cup mold was installed backwards in one cup so it rolled the fabric awkwardly and there are missed stitches in the top band, it will easily fall apart. The bottoms were very well made and your stomach does not fall out if you have an apron. This also ties in the back so not quite as supportive as one that hooks."
2.0,The outside of the case was nice and sturdy but the inside dividers are very flimsy and the vevlet was pieced together often missing spots.<br />I would not recommend this makeup box
2.0,"Horribly made. Seams show on outside, poor quality material. I give it 2 star because I like the design of the material. Top bottom string is way short and hardly makes a bow.  Probably will not order more from this merchant. It looks homemade. Also, the front and back are same size on the bottoms so you're going to show bottom of your cheeks. Yikes."
2.0,Definitely go up 1-2 sizes
2.0,I got my leggings and sports bra yesterday & already want to return it. It is very cute but was a little tight. HUGE DISCLAIMER: there is mesh all across the butt so there is no wearing this set without seeing straight through. A nude color wouldn’t even work because the mesh is the biggest right around the butt seam and you can see right through it. Definitely won’t be wearing :(
2.0,To small an not warm enough. Not what I was expecting so I have to return it.
2.0,Nice material and fit. Just didn’t realized that there wasn’t a “C” to complete the word until after ordering.  Spelling makes no sense.<br />Gave it away.
2.0,Didn’t like the material and too large.
2.0,I ordered other iteams on or before the same day as these glasses and I recieved the other items first. The lens are very bad for my eyes as if they are prescription.
2.0,"Bottoms were NOT a size large, like a tighter medium I’d say. The top had so much potential. Looked cute in the front and support was great, terrible in the back. Silver clasp and strap adjuster along with a lot of unnecessary stretch. Yes it was 8.99, usually with shein or zaful I get great products for the 8.99 kind of price but this one I was unfamiliar with so I should’ve stayed away. Will be returning"
2.0,It basically feels like you can pull the patch right off the shirt.  The patch is not the same quality and applied the way other sequin shirts I have seen. The quality of the actually shirt is good.
2.0,Less than a week of having this product and it’s already starting to rip. Also the Velcro on the thigh part not staying.
2.0,The Polish or paint that they used in the belt comes right off after first use. I have patches all over my belt where the paint has come off completely. The paint also rubbed off on my pants as well turning everything the belt touched a bright brown color
2.0,Kind of loose and frumpy
2.0,I broke within seconds.
2.0,"Should have read the reviews but I took a chance. The mask is soft the plasticeye shield is clear it's comfortable around the ears.<br />It fogs up you have to keep adjusting the mask in order to get the right position so it doesn't fog up,there is no nose piece to align the noses ( I guess because of the eye shield) not good if you wear glasses it really get foggy. It is a good idea just needs some work on the ventilation."
2.0,The add stated that the colors might be a little different than what shows on the site. I ordered purple and the garment is brown. The length was shorter than described. Otherwise its comfortable and soft. It runs a little small -- order a size larger -- it shrinks in the dryer.
2.0,I like hat however it was smashed during shipping:(
2.0,Bought for my niece....she loves it! But after just one wash on the delicate cycle it is already coming undone.  One of the pockets came undone at the stitch.
2.0,So I thought I was a large like my clothes but I’m now down to a small to try and keep them on my hips. Like but not love
2.0,"Bad sewing, sending it back ...."
2.0,"it is a nice warm jacket but the hood does not stay on, no way to tie it or synch it closed."
2.0,"It is as cute as the picture. I was surprised that the material was more like a windbreaker. The elastic is more free-floating, not sown into place."
2.0,"Did not work well for me as an automotive instructor, the fluids I deal with just caused it to constantly spin around my finger and gave me a bad irritation. might work good for someone that didn't work with their hands at all...I'm back wearing my titanium ring which i like 1000 times better, never moves at all...."
2.0,The dress was very large and the material too heavy for what I need it for.
2.0,"It's a weird material- kinda cotton-polyester heavier blend. the collar is just ridiculous- its huge, like 70s. would have been a cute shirt"
2.0,Can’t say how this item fit due to the zipper did not unzip enough to pull on...
2.0,Gorgeous quality just does not fit true to size need to go up at least one size
2.0,The picture makes the product look longer than it is.
2.0,These pants are not very form-fitting and offer little room for movement. I’ll be returning them. The fabric is also more shiny than expected which wasn’t clear from the pics.
2.0,"Very comfortable, arrived fast, but constantly shed.  I find fuzzys all over my floor and between my toes! Everywhere!"
2.0,Really upset took them out of the box for my 3 year old to try on and they have marks on them :( not worth her being upset to return them unfortunately.
2.0,"Great on the back, but crap on covering my +size boobs!😂"
2.0,"THIS CAME AS A BIRGHT YELLOW ROSE OPPOSITE OF THE PICTURE SHOW MAKING IT NOT SO VINTAGE! I DONT LIKE THE CHAIN ATTACHED EITHER ,  IT HAS PROBLEMS FACING THE RIGHT WAY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE CHAIN IS ATTACHED!"
2.0,"After reading several reviews I decided my daughter (5'3 & 100 pounds) needed the small. The swimsuit arrived in 2 days, yay for prime shipping! The swimsuit fit her perfectly length wise, but it was way too big in the back and didn't even come close to fitting. We should have opted for a suit that didn't go so far down in the back.  The padding is cheap and lumpy. The material feels of nice quality though. I wish I had just paid more and got a better swimsuit."
2.0,"Super cute bag, but oddly it pilled - not something I’d ever seen with a canvas bag.  It was inexpensive so it’s fine, but after only occasional use over the summer it looked like I’d had it since college."
2.0,Not bad for price but kids destroyed too fast.
2.0,"2 stars for being a cute, modest swim suit, however the arms were very tight and pulled weird at the top. And as my photo suggests, not the best stitching. It fit in length but I’d suggest sizing up. Especially if you’re child doesn’t have very small bean-poles for arms.<br />I’ll definitely be returning this swim suit."
2.0,Fits weird on me and looks awkward
2.0,Thin material .
2.0,Cute socks. However they run small. I wear a women's 7 shoes and they barely fit. Due to the stitching and pattern they have very little stretch. Disappointing.
2.0,"Starts out great, but heel ends up sliding down into the shoe after a few washes."
2.0,Small than expected the bear is missing an ear and eyes
2.0,They are cure but run either way little or something is wrong with my order. Wish seller would reach out to me and make this right. 😭😢
2.0,No symmetry! Big balls on one side and little on the other leaves one looking lopsided. They are pretty and you get 4.
2.0,Love the piece but it was too small to wear. I am five feet 1inch and wear a 2-3X top depending on the brand. This was way too tight to wear.
2.0,"I was really excited when I got the dress I'm 5f 8' 160lbs the med fits perfectly.  The detail on the front is a belt that is suppose to hook at the back,the belt made the dress, soo can you imagine my disappointment and upset when the belt is no good, belt cannot close and there is nothing to hold it. two ends with nothing. very upsetting.  The defective belt killed it for me."
2.0,The cups are super visible and don’t stay in place. For this reason i gave it a 2. It looks tacky. I found the straps to be long. I’m a 34g and i woukd Need to wear a bra with this.
2.0,This was very thin ... I wanted something more sweater like.
2.0,This does not fit like the picture describes. I even ordered 2 sizes bigger than I normally wear
2.0,This is too small for my 3 year old's head.  Might be good for an infant but not an average size toddler.
2.0,"I returned these because even though they were super comfortable while standing, every time I sat down the waist would roll down and then you could see the outline of it through my dress.  I even ordered one size larger just in case. I think they just need a bit more fabric so they it a bit higher or?"
2.0,Fit smaller than expected. Same size I generally get with the products here on Amazon.
2.0,"Beautiful design, but really stiff & noisy."
2.0,"I purchased 2 shirts in the X-large size, not the large size. I'm only 5'9&#34; tall, and at 170 pounds, miles away from being what anyone thinks of as being &#34;in shape&#34;. If you are taller (5'11&#34;+) and super uber skinny for your height (less than 140lbs), this might work for you. Having said that, quality, for a tropical climate shirt, looks pretty darn good.<br /><br />I remember reading a review before buying this that recommended going one size over normal and that review was written by somebody who claimed to have biceps and chest measurements that I haven't seen in the mirror in 25 years, and who said it fit just fine. With confidence, I can say that IF he was describing the shirts that I received that review was a pile of bovine fecal matter.<br /><br />I hope the company that makes these, or distributes these, chooses to alter their designs… I would love these during summertime in Maui, Costa Rica, or even Seattle if they fit! They are sharp and well made, if poorly designed."
2.0,"This watch band is very pretty, light weight and comfortable. Unfortunately the edges snagged on everything! So disappointing that I have to return it."
2.0,litte small
2.0,"It is not by any means a warm hoodie, this is a hoodie you throw on to help grab groceries from the car. There’s no structure to it at all, it doesn’t hug you it’s loose so as a plus sized person it’s just not as flattering as it would be on someone w a slimmer body. It’s literally just fabric. The plaid part is literally see through."
2.0,Color is good but this dress is very thin so I wear it only on the beach.
2.0,Wore it like 5 times and it started coming apart at the seams
2.0,Belt is good for around 50 wearings till it splits. I gave it two stars instead of one since the belt actually looked nice until it split.
2.0,Very stiff hat. If you have a big head like me I wouldn’t recommend
2.0,The image began and the lettering began to come off after the very first time in the washer. After a handful of times in the washer it is essentially a grey sleeping shirt
2.0,The material was stiff and not soft like I thought it would be. Also the sizing ran very large.
2.0,Cute but very thin. My face nail poked right through them
2.0,The red necklace clouded up after about a week of wear. I'm a bit disappointed.
2.0,Extremely undersized!  Sleeves were 3/4 length. Picture is not accurate.
2.0,Now let me start off with 2 things...the design is really nice and i have a small head. Why do i say this you might be thinking? Well...my glasses are smaller. Much smaller than normal. With that being said they STILL didnt fit into the cases. I had to try and find a unique way to put them in the case where they wouldnt be strained...which was unsuccessful. The only way i could get them in there was to close the case on the legs of my glasses. (Dont know technical term) Then lightly push the legs in past the case so it will close. Meanwhile you can hear the felt insert on the inside crackle as if its taking damage. You can also see spaces under the insert where its clear the felt isnt really put in there snug against the case. Literally just an insert. So its prone to take a beating by normal use. Also i had the case for 2 days and the outside material was pilfering. Not a huge deal but noticable and considering the only thing this case has going for it is its aesthetic i would disappointingly say that this product is NOT worth a purchase. I wanted to like it. I tried to deal with it to avoid return hassle but im literally worried it will break my glasses. Another thing that annoys me is this case can't stand on its own open. It will fall over onto its back where the hinges are. Might be only personal but that made it annoying for using casually. My other standard purchase case required 1 hand to use. This requires 2.
2.0,"Well, I really like the color.  It was too small across the breast.  I don’t like sweatshirts too tight.  Material was a bit lighter weight than I expected, but that is ok."
2.0,"The picture was really pretty but when I received it, it was broken."
2.0,"I was disappointed with this piece. The heart is tarnished & it will not buff out. I know it's not high priced, but I hoped it would be in better condition."
2.0,"They are soft but because of whatever fabric combo they are made of, you have stinky pits in the morning. Even with showering and putting on deodorant at night before putting them on. Wouldn’t recommend just based on that."
2.0,Fabric was thin and flimsy. Looked very cheap. I returned it.
2.0,THE socks slip. off the foot. Not for me!!!
2.0,"I initially liked the design of this sweater, but when I tried it on, the length did not go beneath my knees and I'm 5'3"".  Also, the flaps along the front didn't lay down flat, which gave it a cheap look.  Also, the flaps aren't as wide as shown and don't reach to my sides. I like the color but that's about it."
2.0,"I thought it was two of them, my mistake. However, the product sucks. It doesn't add any true support to my arch, all it does it squeeze the area, which you can do with any band."
2.0,I expected the dress to be a little longer as was shown in the picture.
2.0,Uh this was wayyyy to big. I got a size medium and wished I got an extra small. Don’t listen to the reviews saying to order a size up I’m pretty sure they just don’t know their size.
2.0,Too small. Way. Too. Small. In what universe is this an XL?
2.0,Beautiful but wore once and already a hole
2.0,It’s too large for me
2.0,The straps refuse to stay buckled and the smell at first was a nightmare. Ugh.
2.0,"I was so disappointed in this dress. The fabric is awful and the fit was not great. The ""belt"" wrap didn't sit right on the dress and looked off when I put the dress on."
2.0,Watch is poor quality for the price. The bezel has so much wiggle and the movement isn't very accurate. If it was around $500 it would be a great watch. Not for over $1000.
2.0,I only give them 2 stars because they are a very long pant. If you are tall these are great! I am 4’11 and they are are too long. If I tailored them it would looks the band at the bottom. BUT... they where amazing at handling my return and appreciate them working with me.
2.0,"So, I had to order 2 band sizes bigger and 1 cup size smaller to fit. This bra has no stretch at all in the cups. The first bra I bought in my normal cup size DD and it was too big. Went down to a D and it fit much better. I prefer a more natural rounded cup, but I like the wider back band. The back still rolls and rides up, so I have to keep pulling it down. I also hate that the straps have hooks for adjustment. So, there isn't much adjustment at all and the hooks keep coming unhooked! Wish it was a normal strap adjustment."
2.0,"I was so hoping to get relief from my foot pain.  Sadly, these just made it worse.  Fearing surgery is in my future.😟"
2.0,"Fits like a nightgown and material is like a cheap silky nightgown. Sort of bummed, but I guess I have some new sleepwear!"
2.0,The oddest wording. Most tarnished.
2.0,The hood is the only thing I liked about it. Packaging was shabby.  I ordered what was supposed to be dark grey but it was light grey.  It looked like it recklessly sewed together in a couple seconds before it was shipped had long loose threads.  I was very upset and was embarrassed to give it as the gift it was intended to be. Do not wear this alone in the winter.  Cheap cheap material.  :(
2.0,Optics aren't very good and the frame is a little narrow
2.0,Seemed a bit small where I couldn't get 1 inch cut outs inside of them.
2.0,Wrapping is not easy to do to get everything lineup on body
2.0,I find it difficult to wear as it fogs up and harder to breathe inside.  I did take a hair band and made a knot at the top and safety pinned the back to make it fit snugger and further up on my head.  That really improved the wear.
2.0,"I thought this was cotton, but it is more a polyester material."
2.0,"I only wore this a few times, I was gentle with this, and the chain broke twice. I did try to fix it after the first time but a day later of me wearing it for a couple of hours it broke."
2.0,The strap was broken when I received it. I tried to fix it since the bad is really cute but it only made it worse. The bag was pretty poorly made because now even more has broken from it.
2.0,Cute glasses but was not happy that one of the nose guard pieces was missing and it hurts my nose with out it.
2.0,Strap came apart from base of shoe (glued on) after less than a year of intermittent use
2.0,Cheap looking fabric.
2.0,"Material is cheap and seems a little see thru. I was not really happy with this purchase. But then again, it was an inexpensive shirt. I was just hoping it was like a cotton material. It's not. shiny, Polyester material."
2.0,The pleatherdoesn't allow your skin to breath so you sweat and then the  rivets rust in short order.  If it's worn really loose it might be ok.
2.0,Dress straps broke off as soon as I put it on.  Material was uncomfortable . The worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon.
2.0,In my opinion the pendant is just too large. Rather than looking elegant it looks like children's jewelry.
2.0,The Taurus and Sagittarius are spelled wrong and I can't use them. They came as advertised so look closely at the picture and make sure that you are OK with the difference.
2.0,Band clip broke. This is not made as good as the original band that comes with watch. Clips a poor. My band broke within 6 months right at the whatcha face. Could not use
2.0,These were terrible. Very cheaply made. No compression at all.
2.0,These run big in size. I wear a size 10 shoe and the large is too wide.
2.0,I had to return this item because I'm pretty busty and I couldn't completely zip it up for my size. The leather is very thick and very heavy too heavy for what I was looking for.
2.0,Like the thinest t-shirt sleeve that you own.
2.0,"Love the design, but they don't come up very high on the ankle.  Think I like the ones I bought for the men on my list for Christmas."
2.0,Super cute but WAAAY too small.
2.0,It's royal blue not navy and it is more elastic like than the picture looks. The neck line is rippled and not smooth. Will be returning.
2.0,Sent it back.  Couldn’t get anything in it as it’s very skinny
2.0,The glasses were OK if they were about three times stronger would be great... they slightly help looking forward...  but on the sides Block most of the glare.
2.0,Weird collar
2.0,These earrings are cute but they are very small. The pictures make them appear a bit bigger but they are small.
2.0,Bought for my 6 year old. He loves them! Unfortunately he only wore about 10 times before the charger broke 17 days after the return window. It was a Christmas gift so we purchased early Dec.
2.0,One of the gauges is a size larger than the other one. Jewelry is pretty cute but pieces of excess glue were stuck to the gem from where it was glued on. Not really happy with these 🤷‍♀️
2.0,"They fit fine, but after washing them only once the leggings look old and there are fuzzies all over. Will never buy them again."
2.0,The stitches we're falling out as soon as unpackaged.
2.0,"I purchased this a year and a half ago. I needed a basic belt to wear with jeans, and I specifically looked for leather for the durability.<br /><br />Well, the belt recently broke. Not the buckle but the actual belt. I expect some wear & tear, but how does this even happen? It’s not like I forgot that I got shivved. One moment I’m just walking around and the next, wardrobe malfunction. I’m giving 2 stars because it looked okay at first."
2.0,nice cheap bag but not sturdy enough for an iceblock and containers every single day. The zipper seam stitching opened up
2.0,"Came in a little small but otherwise, great dress. I ended up giving it away to someone who fits a small typically."
2.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size up form my usual and the skirt was too small!  It doesn't have the elastic all around the skirt only on one part... Which doesn't make sense due to it suppose to go over your stomach... I'm a plus size female and I really thought this was cute but did not fit..
2.0,This was not a flattering look on me or my daughters. 3 different body types and did not look good on any of us. Sent it back.
2.0,It was missing a snap. Also a little on the small side if you have bigger wrists.
2.0,"Beautiful bracelet,  but did not fit my hand one bit.<br />Funny thing is that I have a small hand.<br />Too bad."
2.0,The top it’s way to tight. I returned the first pair thinking that getting a bigger size would help and it didn’t. All of her shoes are mini Melissa. This is the only model that is very uncomfortable and tight.
2.0,"these masks are not the ones i thought I was purchasing, as you can see by the pictures, they are a completely different mask than the pictures they have, the material is a cheap polyester feel and the lanyards are made of cheap plastic and what looks like shoe laces, the masks do what is required i guess,  so i will probably wear them since i paid for them and waited a month to recieve them, but it's not what I ordered and not even close to the quality they promised."
2.0,These run SUPER small! I got these for my 17yr old for Christmas and we ended up passing them along to my 11yr old niece 😳 The material was nice.
2.0,Is very very slim fit. Not usefull for me
2.0,I ordered two pairs of these PJ's one was Buzz Aldrin NASA and this pair. Please refer to that review. They were to small (both).
2.0,"I ordered a size L and this shirt was still a little too cropped and tight for my liking. Personally, I like my cropped shirts to land just where my high-waisted pants are and these landed much higher. I am flat chested with a small torso (I'm 5'4"") so this usually isn't a problem for me. If you have a bigger boobs and a long torso, you should probably go up a size."
2.0,"I ordered the size 11 up to about 14, can't remember the upper size, and I wear a size 11.5 shoe, but I can barely get my feet in these.  Doubt if I will be wearing these very often since they are so small and very tight."
2.0,Fabric is thin and it doesn't hold its shape like in the picture.
2.0,Back sags.
2.0,"although this is a beautiful piercing & the packaging was amazing, unfortunately my black rose fell off the day i got it. while putting the piercing in it just completely came off. i do plan on gluing it back on, just disappointed/shocked at the cheap making of the rose. other than that it’s a gorgeous looking jewelry.<br />update: i tried gluing it back on & it didn’t work :("
2.0,"Pretty pattern with vertical accents.  Cut is small, VERY HIGH WAISTED, and short.  Disappointed 😞"
2.0,Engraving looks very cheesy
2.0,"Very cheap, but what do you expect for the price.  Actual rings did not look as nice as picture shown.  All were sized 4 or down."
2.0,clasp keeps opening on it
2.0,"This is an inexpensive skate costume/dress.  I bought it to wear in &#34;sessions&#34; -- it suits the purpose:  allows plenty of room to move and is attractive.  It is not a true &#34;skate costume&#34; as it does not include &#34;bloomers&#34;.  In addition to tights you need to wear bike/exercise shorts.  The fit is very boxy.... No waist or flair to skirt.  No darts to define just or shape.  For the price, it is okay for a dressy appearance while working out in a skating rink, but you still need to CYA if you are doing jumps or arabesques."
2.0,"the material was really soft and it was a good length but because of the thick waistband and the pockets, it make me look really wide.  I ended up returning it."
2.0,These are said to be 6-13 in size that is incorrect. They are small so if you need  a larger size don't order these. Not even close to larger size
2.0,I own 2 other XXL Guiness-brand rugby shirts.  This particular shirt is considerably smaller than the others.  This is a real disappointment considering I had the shirt shipped from the US to Hong Kong.
2.0,Very cheap and took over 1.5 months to get here.
2.0,Didn't look like real silver at all
2.0,Not the gauzy cotton I wanted
2.0,I think for the price that it was at I was expecting them to be flawless. I ordered two and both of the glasses where dirty and scratched. I does the job and protects your eyes so it does serve it purpose just wish it was more new looking.
2.0,"I have huge calves, so I thought these would work. They are cute and comfy, but they have no real compression to them. I am a nurse, and these feel like regular socks I bought from the department store."
2.0,I love the look and style of these earrings but the tassels are placed on so loosely that they slip and slide every direction.
2.0,"Much cheaper, flimsy, and smaller then I was expecting. The chain wasnt durable at all. I thought I was getting a good deal, but as they say YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"
2.0,Fabric poor quality
2.0,"I got these for my daith. I wanted the same size what was in my ear, 16g 10mm but didn't know that at the time. I got 8mm, and don't regret. Happy accident. If you had a daith, I recommend it. But one of my hinges is very loose. Like if I accidently rub the inside of my ear, it comes open. Paid $16 and I found cheaper anodized titanium on body candy for $10. For 10mm $6. Disappointed."
2.0,"The sleeves were exceptionally long for the blouse.This was a gift,but when they put it on the sleeves looked long.I then tried it on and the cuffs came past most  of my finger tips. Color was nice and fabric had a nice feel,but just oddly sized.Had to return."
2.0,Fell apart quickly.
2.0,"Bought this at Costco, really was only able to wear it once, it shrank sooo much after the first wash."
2.0,Great hooded sweater  but I ordered a 2X and was sent a 3X
2.0,"My daughter loved them and took very good care of them BUT after 2 months one of the shoes has already stopped charging, I was lucky enough that they were fulfilled by Amazon and they were nice enough to allow me to return them."
2.0,The color shows hot pink. Even the variance of a monitor could account for the color change. This was red. A dark red. I bought it for the color. Thee sizing was ridiculously off as well. Apparently this has been an issue because at least one of the 4 matching items I returned said that issue had been fixed. I order a lot of gear and am rarely far off. The material quality was good. I returned all 4 pieces.
2.0,"These felt awesome, didnt look thin at all.... I was sure I'd found a decently priced LuLaRoe substitute.... so I wear them to work... actually I wear them into the livingroom while getting READY FOR WORK, & BAM!!! 2 random holes?!?! Yep (not on the seams either.... one on the butt and one on the leg)! Just like that. And they weren't tight at all.... actually a little bunched. Soooo back these go! Thank god I didn't make it out the door yet b/c OMG !!!"
2.0,The stirrups work best for me because I wear short socks at work.  The gator clip attachments work much better than the other types because they don't come off easily and are more secure.<br /><br />The downside is the stitching where the loops connect.  I've had the product for about 2 months and the stitching is coming loose on both sides. I wear the stays 40 hrs a week with ankle high boots.
2.0,The look of these at spot on! I was so excited to wear them as my shoes at an outdoor wedding. Sadly I spent the whole night putting them back together! They kept pulling apart and finally the chain broke. From the toe to the ankle is too long and I'm a size 10. If you are good at fixing jewelry these are great!
2.0,Tear at seam
2.0,"These would be great if they were longer. Because they are already shorter to start with, and have some stretch to them, they ride up. I'm 5'7&#34; athletic build. 140#... ordered a large. I wear them under my scrub tops, but constantly have to pull them down. They are comfortable otherwise, and keep their color."
2.0,"these are not stone, they are plastic"
2.0,"This item is pictured mid thigh long, that's untrue. It is waist high. Not as shown!!"
2.0,"I had sent in a video saying that I thought the reason people were having problems with the excess fabric up top was because they were not wearing it correctly---the reveiwers'  photos show that they did not criss-cross it in front around their neck the way the suit manufacturer shows in their photos.  However, when I received my suit, I had the same problem despite wearing it correctly!  I can't size down because then the bottom will be too small.  Hopefully they will remove my video..... Too bad, because I was really hoping this suit was as cute as it looked!"
2.0,The design looked beautiful on-line but I don't like how it lays on my neck. It slides freely and most of the time it ends of hiding in my cleavage. I will avoid this style of necklace in the future.
2.0,Not sturdy enough and the backs that were sent do not fit.
2.0,Not the same hat that's on the picture . I was thinking it had mesh on top just like the black hat on the picture . Works well for shade and dries quick . I wish it had more air flow .
2.0,I will say there really pretty but pretty dosen't keep the barbell in my ear. The ball wont stay screwed into the barbell itself. So when the bar is in my ear it wont stay in because the ball falls off. I have even had two of the balls so far just fall all apart in my hand (like brake to pieces). So no I would never buy these again.
2.0,Too small by a couple sizes; didn't match the size chart. Seller never responded to my return request.
2.0,The fabric is stretchy but very thin!
2.0,"I can't say I liked this product. I ordered nude and it looks more white than anything. If your looking to buy a NUDE nose ring, your money would be better spent somewhere else. Also very flimsy. I wish someone would have wrote a review for this so I wouldn't have spent money on it, on shipping and money on returning it I got maybe $3.00 out of $10.00 back"
2.0,"They were very cute but tight on my one year old and the worst part was that when you return them they charge you for shipping. They shouldn’t be selling on Amazon, I pay for a membership so that I can receive in return without additional cost."
2.0,They don't stay tight. They slip off.
2.0,The small ball earrings are a very opaque (dark) silver compare to picture and other fashion earrings included in package.
2.0,"I am a bit disappointed in this blouse. I ordered a small and although I am a small or x-small, this blouse did not fit. Or, it fit kind of strangely. Tight around the bust and did not flow smoothly down the sides. Tight around my butt...just weird. I had to return it."
2.0,Wry very tiny. Too small. Fragile. Seem to bend easily.
2.0,It is pretty but plastic looking. It feels like a toy wallet
2.0,"I'm 5'8, about 200lbs and these jeans are incredibly too tight. I like the style, but I like to breath in my pants also"
2.0,"My daughter loves these finger armor rings and she was so excited I found a 4 pack. However when they arrived, 2 of the 4 were actually broken. They didn’t simply fall off the hinge they wouldn’t connect at all. Kind of disappointing."
2.0,Too small. Order up sizes.
2.0,A little exspensive for what it was.
2.0,I had to put my coins in several mins. After the time and using the brush that came with it I saw a bit of a difference
2.0,This dress irritates to my baby skin.. she was not at all comfortable so I returned it
2.0,I sent this dresss back
2.0,Disappointed.... it’s cute but very see through.  I wouldn’t wear it as an outfit. I’m keeping for a bathing suit cover up.
2.0,Too small size
2.0,because I'm curvy it didn't have as good of a stretch as id like it to have.
2.0,The material is odd and the pose of the model makes the slits seem higher and placed farther forward.
2.0,Not flattering at all and runs large. Flimsy material. I sent it back.
2.0,"I was supposed to receive purple, yellow and blue. But the yellow & purple were MIA. The blue is a pale blue. I received a light green, a deep pink and a pale blue.  I did received a refund."
2.0,I ordered a large and it fits like a small! I'm not even sure if I received a large because there is no size tag.
2.0,"Too big for me, and too tight for my husband."
2.0,"Looks much cheaper in person.  Edge of band is not exposed leather, but a plastic strip"
2.0,"When I first received this scarf, I was quite happy.  I purchase it from TitFus, since they have it listed as their product, and although many sellers were somewhat cheaper, I would rather pay a couple dollars more for better quality.  This item was nice and soft, and does a great job of keeping you warm.  I have had it now for 34 days, 4 days after the return policy, and after such a short period, the knitting is already beginning to come apart.  It will probably last through this winter, but not into next winter. I was hoping for better, but be warned this is not going to last long.  Also note that the stitching is very large and it is a highly bulky scarf.  I wanted bulky, but with a better quality.  TitFus be aware that the quality needs improvement."
2.0,Won't stay fasten.
2.0,Very cheap material. There will be holes in these in no time.
2.0,The watch is cute but very fragile. I tried to adjust to my wrist and the cuff broke and to save it I had to glued it.
2.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; 105 lbs and ordered a S. It fit right, except that the gap between the cups was way too large. It was pushing my breasts outwards into my armpits. I had to return it. The stitching and material was good so it gets a second star for that, but it was not wearable"
2.0,This nightgown was too fitted for me. The buttons were not comfortable. It is 95%cotton but in my opinion 100% cotton makes a huge difference.
2.0,I love the pattern and the colors but this dress is way too small and I ordered the size I always wear.  The material for the skirt/chevron part is also very thin - almost see-thru thing.
2.0,These shoes were way smaller than expected. I usually wear an 11 and these were the equivalent of a 9.
2.0,Didn't set right in the chest area
2.0,"I forget what type of material it was but it clung tightly to my body. I don’t think I picked the wrong size but didn’t look that great on me. Too tight, wanted it more loose fitting so had to return it"
2.0,Seems very cheaply made. Sleeves are not hemmed they look like they were just cut to be short.
2.0,"My initial reaction to material quality is positive (I just got them, time will tell).<br />However, as my picture demonstrates, the ""rally"" holes on my strap are not cut straight.<br /><br />I took the pictures of the underside because it was easier for my camera to capture contrasting colors, but the top side, of course, is crooked as well.<br /><br />Watch people tend to be a little OCD - no offense intended, as I am referring to myself, among others.<br />Watch people obsess over minute (pun intended) imperfections and microscopic irregularities.<br />Go ask a Seiko fan about chapter ring alignment, I dare you!  😂😅🤣<br /><br />This strap manufacturer must have ""watch people"" as a primary intended marketing target, right?<br />So to encounter these crooked examples is absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />Then, there is the price.<br />I am perfectly aware this is not the most expensive strap (by far), but it is also 2 to 3 times more costly then some of my other straps, which are perfectly aligned and of similar quality.<br />So when I bought this, I expected 2 to 3 times the quality of my less expensive straps. Sadly, I did not get this quality ""bump"".<br /><br />I would definitely return for refund, but I am currently in a job requiring me to travel all the time, making post office hassles difficult.<br />So I am going to willpower through my OCD and use this, but grudgingly.<br />My watch collection now consists of couple of dozen watches, and I have MANY straps, and I change them often.<br />If this were my only strap for my only watch, this wouldn't do, no way.<br /><br />As you might have gathered by now, I do not recommend this.  🧐"
2.0,Sorry but the pants were the wrong size. I was hoping to replace for my husband but he decided he didn’t want pants. Please refund...Thank you!
2.0,I don’t know who could wear these earrings. They are so heavy. I think they would rip your ear hole.
2.0,The sizing off! Bought 1 too small bought again size too big! Good luck to you!
2.0,I ordered white and got a VERY off white version!!  I needed white. It's a great product. Feels so soft. Just NOT the color I ordered.
2.0,I love the looks of the suit but the bottoms are very short wasted and not comfortable
2.0,Bought a red and white one. Both arrived with broken clips. Two stars cause shipping was within two weeks.
2.0,It looked OK and I wore it for half a day. At some point the metal link broke and I lost the pendant. I did not even feel when it happened. So it looks interesting but the quality is not that great.
2.0,Fabric is cheap and when washed has a twist in the fall. Not a good choice if you like quality.
2.0,"If this had a better fit, it would've been a keeper."
2.0,This ring is interesting but I don't wear it anymore because it tarnished and looks gold now. It's partly my fault because I thought it was stainless.
2.0,"These are spendy and supposed to be better than others, but they didn't work very long.  After only a couple of months, one of the clasps stopped gripping the shirt and would slide off.  Upsetting since they worked so well initially."
2.0,Metal was all scuffed up. Tried to contact company without success.
2.0,Very low cut and wrap doesn’t fall correctly.  The fabrics is a weird almost plastic feel which makes for a weird drape.
2.0,Lovely .. but Hugh band !
2.0,The earrings tarnished.
2.0,The cut and measurements were spot on but the fabric pills the first time it's worn. Not wool but rather a poly fleece.
2.0,Dress is very cute. Fabric is thin but okay but has absolutely no stretch. As soon as I took it from the package I could see it was too small.  Read reviews and sizes small and medium sounded like they were too big for customers but larger sizes too small. One size maybe??? Held it next to my other XL dresses and it is way smaller top and bottom. Can't even wear it as a beach cover. Returning it. Shame because I like the pattern
2.0,I’m 5’ 6” and a size 4 and I do love the cute look of this on but what ruins this jumpsuit for me is that it is made of cheap Halloween costume fabric..... feels incredibly cheap. Don’t sweat in it because the smell this fabric has when warm and damp on the body is ghastly since it doesn’t breathe. Wouldn’t wear it in the cold either since it’s not even close to warm.
2.0,"My mom loves everything from turn off century. I purchased this as a gift for her expecting 3 bonnets. While I knew I could choose which, I even prepared myself they may all be the same. That wasn’t the issue because only ones was in package. I would have returned the item, but mommy loved it so much I didn’t have the heart to tell her she should have had 2 additional ones."
2.0,Returned it. Didn't fit right. Too wrinkled from being mailed waded up in tight small package.  Had some difficulty returning. Had to pay for shipping.  Just don't order it.
2.0,"The dress came on time as expected, my return was processed very quickly.<br /><br />I bought several dresses just like this from Zeta Fashion, I bought a color here that Zeta did not have. The quality of the dress is night and day. This one was see through and it ran smaller. It did not fit my chest area, in fact it was sewn awkwardly so one side squeezed more than the other. I sent it back."
2.0,1 boot was a different size than the other one. marked on boots
2.0,The stitching on the bow is ridiculous. I’m insulted that they had the nerve to package this and sell it. Poor quality. No way am I putting this on my child.
2.0,"Literally broke within a week just from being on my face. I dont have the widest head in the world at all, but I guess the strain from the ear oieces being slightly pulled apart is too much for these cheap shades. Ridiculous."
2.0,"Meh, it's small and passible. Not as bad as their blue pattern"
2.0,The material is super thin. And even though I ordered a xxl it was still very tight and see through.
2.0,Small fit me large.  The dress don't look like the picture. Returned
2.0,"If you don’t have a tiny head, stay away. It is supposed to be used to change at the beach so it should be super easy to put on and off, but it is not."
2.0,This is not what I expected at all.  The fabric was silky and see-through.  Way to big.  I am returning this dress.. I was hoping with the split it would work for me but bot the right one for my 5'2 body.
2.0,I bought this but it runs way to small. I gave to my daughter
2.0,The sellers should let you mismatch sizes because my top fit & my bottom couldn’t even go over my butt so now I have to return the entire thing. However it is really nice.
2.0,"This is a beautiful product, but as soon as I put it on it broke, put it together and broke 2 more times in less than a week…"
2.0,Overall the ring was ok but the side stones showed glue when I first received it and eventually the stones fell out so not to0 happy about that.
2.0,"I ordered this bag hoping it would be great for summer.  It arrived pretty quickly and the packaging was nice.  But when I took it out of the plastic I realized it wasn't at all what I thought it would be.  Although the leather itself is quite nice, the inner liner is a thin, plastic-like material that I know from experience will not last long with frequent use.  It's the kind of liner that typically comes in cheaply made handbags to cut costs.  The other thing I really dislike about it are the straps.  The edges are raw cut leather, and they're thin straps.  Because the leather itself is actually thick, I can see the sharp edges digging into my shoulders a lot, which would not be comfortable with sleeveless shirts and tank tops.  I love the style and the look of the bag, but the quality is less than I expected."
2.0,I really like the style and the materials pf the jacket. But the 3X is like a L in US sizes. If they had a 5X(China) available I would get 2.
2.0,Really poorly made dress. Just wore for the first time and the tassel fell off after only a few hours. It’s a cute print but really cheap fabric and also is pretty tedious to button. I don’t recommend purchasing.
2.0,"I typically always by the 18G 1/4 hoop nose rings and it usually fits perfect. To my suprise, this product did not. It's very small and I don't think it's 18G as ALL my nose rings are 18G and this is the only one that did fit. I tried to open it up with pliers and it helped a little bit but it doesn't hoop around my nose all the way."
2.0,"thought ordered a 2xxl but medium sent regifted to grand daughter, they can resend free corrected size"
2.0,The top I received is not the same as pictured. Different material and the knot is different. I didn't like the material.
2.0,"I'm normally a 12 and based on reviews bought a 14.  Everything fit except the bust area was too short...so this dress is not for big busted women, even the larger sizes.  But the most awkward part was the sleeves, which felt way too heavy and bulky."
2.0,This is not good for large size breast even when I ordered large . I didn’t even get to use it because it didn’t stick well .
2.0,Sizing wasn’t marked and hard to tell which one was the adult size or the child size without opening all of them up. Not individually wrapped ☹️
2.0,After a week shoes felt cheap and made a popping sound in the heel . But they were comfortable.
2.0,The large cz's are not dazzling in fact they are dull.
2.0,"This fit was awkward and unflattering. I will not wear it but I kept it incase I have anyone come over who might need a suit.<br /><br />Baggy around the boobs which was not only unattractive, but also makes it easy for inappropriate viewing of the upper half."
2.0,The price is ok but it looks it too very cheap looking for what I wanted it for ok got every day use
2.0,My teen daughter got this mask. The design was as advertised but the size of the mask is for a man with a very large head. We made a joke it of telling her she can wear it as a hat.
2.0,Fit like a trash bag
2.0,mine broke after wearing it one day
2.0,"I bought this shirt because it says it comes in 35-36 sleeve length, which is hard to find.<br />While the packaging says 35-36 sleeve, it's just like all the other 34-35 that i have every tried on.<br />very disappointing"
2.0,"I bought a pair of these and as sunglasses they are not so great - after 2 weeks on a boat the gold lens coating flaked off. Gill confirm that they have seen this problem before  and offered to exchange them - not much point  without fixing the problem so I have to try and get a refund from the dealer now. They should be better for the mid range price so either stick to cheapos and expect them to only last a few months  or buy Raybans, I have a pair 21 years  old still going strong and now back in fashion although gold aviators never went out of fashion. Don't buy these."
2.0,"These literally broke after 1 week or wear. Nothing extreme happened to break them, was just taking them off and they broke."
2.0,This strap is much thinner than it looks in the picture. Definitely not 1.5mm thick like the product description states. It looks okay but feels cheap and smells strongly of tanning chemicals. Would not buy again.
2.0,This shirt is not cute at all. It fits improperly as well.
2.0,"I must admit I'm rather picky when it comes to the thickness of the material in my workout pants and these are paper thin.  They feel nice and are fine for lounging around, but definitely not up to par when it comes to what I want in my capris!"
2.0,Gets caught in clothes
2.0,"Really deceiving. It’s more like a swim suit cover up wrap skirt. Definitely size up twice. Can be worn as a skirt you just have to pin yourself in it. Material isn’t the best quality either. Other than that, cute print."
2.0,If you are or taller this dress goes to about mind calve. The size is nice its not tight and im about 6'0 250lbs. Im a bit disappointed in the length tho
2.0,Love the dress but it’s not true to size
2.0,Not what expected. Not large as picture. Quality is poor  Looks very cheap.
2.0,too small/much smaller than expected
2.0,"Run very small, younger daughter loves them though"
2.0,"These shorts fit good, they look great, I really like that they have back pockets and that cargo pocket but they are cheaply made, I had worn these shorts for about a week, washed them twice and they have unsewn from one of the back pockets leaving a big hole and they also have started to rip from the cargo pocket."
2.0,"Bought 3 of these when the Eastport bag was unavailable.  The quality is not that good and the straps are very short for shoulder use. I also have the Eastport bag and there's no comparison, only  $1.00 difference."
2.0,They stretch out easily.
2.0,This dress runs extremely small and there is no option for exchange just return in which they take a shipping fee out of your refund when returned. I was so looking forward to this dress too!!
2.0,Printing hangs off bottom of mask so looks cheap. We ordered another one of just print and it is fine.
2.0,I loved it when we got it. It's been not even a week and it's tarnishing and turning black already.... Not sure why it's getting dirty and turning already. I'm not happy!! This meant a lot to who I gave it to. I'm going to try to clean it. :( it says real sterling silver. So why is this happening???
2.0,We’re not true to size
2.0,"leaking, suction is not good. If I shorten rubber strap goggles would start hurting my nose."
2.0,"It was a little cheaper looking than I expected. Hopefully, it won't turn my niece's wrist green."
2.0,"Pay close attention to the picture with the dimensions!  The  heart is only 1 cm wide, which is extremely tiny.  It looks like kid jewelry, but the chain is too fine to be practical for a kid."
2.0,They came apart after second time wearing them
2.0,"It extremely soft, but I ordered a 3X and if’s probably about an XL"
2.0,These are rest short. They didn’t go all the way up my wife’s thigh. They barely past her calf. She’s not even y’all. She’s below 5ft. Lol
2.0,It came with a very cheap chain that broke within a few hours. The clasp wont stay closed. Its about what I expected though.
2.0,"After only 2 months, mine  are coming apart and loose ends have to be trimmed.  They fit nicely and allow venting, just not holding up at all and will need to purchase something else as a replacement."
2.0,Cheap quality material in my opinion and the breast area is a weird cut. Like it’s cut for breasts that would be way to the side towards the ribs on both sides. Lol. Doesn’t fit well for small breasted women
2.0,"Very pretty case but structurally fell apart after on month.  Plastic phone case broke into pieces, magnetic close ripped.  I never dropped it and used it as normally.  I would not recommend."
2.0,"Let me start with the good. The face mask passed the candle test. So I would feel safe wearing this when I'm out and about.<br /><br />On the other hand, contrary to what I read in the reviews, I found that the fastener on the ear loops didn't hold that well (they slipped from the length that I had tightened them to) and even with the nose wire, the mask slipped down my nose.<br /><br />What I found most disappointing (but didn't see anyone else point it out), is that after wearing the face for what was probably less than an hour, the mask picked up a very unpleasant, foul odor (undoubtedly from my breath), stronger than what I have never experienced with any other mask."
2.0,Smaller then expected. Straps not that long.  One strap already broke
2.0,I’m normally an XL but experience making clothing purchases online has taught me to order one size larger. I purchased a XXL and after one washing it shrunk significantly.
2.0,Didn't bring the funnel or tools to put ashes into urn. the necklace itself it really big and looks more like costume jewelry
2.0,Size 14/16 purchased an xl the top is shortens a bit snug but the bottoms fit nicely. After 1 wash on delicate the side seam on the shirt is coming undone though
2.0,"I'm giving it 2 stars because it was cute, but overall it was so. Cheap. I used it daily and really liked it, until it broke after 2 weeks. Too cheap to replace. I just ended up buying another purse at Marshalls. If you're looking for a cheap product (it's cheap looking too) that you will use rarely and with extra care, than this is for you. If not, find something better."
2.0,"stones fell out on first wear, but return was ok."
2.0,fell out
2.0,Returned it.. way too large
2.0,marca mucho en todas partes 👀
2.0,These are made out of a nylon material that runs just like nylons. Mine fell apart.
2.0,"The quality was disappointing on several fronts. The strap was straight up cheap, I figured it would snap the first time I used it, so I returned this bag promptly after receiving it. The cute tassel on the hand strap is stiff and inflexible so it doesnt move as it ought to. And its only visible when you have the small handles up. If you use the crossbody strap and lay the handles down the tassel looks like stray strings hanging down. The overall material was very low quality and I was worried it would rip apart immediately. Basically, this purse is cute online and crap in real life."
2.0,"This product is a huge disappointment. The lace trim doesn’t match up in the middle at cleavage level. I am unable to wear it for a peekaboo lace look under my blouses. I’d return it, but I washed them before I inspected them for flaws."
2.0,These DO NOT look like the photo. The pockets are tiny and they are NOT fitted.
2.0,I got an xxl and it fits like a medium...the shirt fits way too small
2.0,"Really like the idea of this phone/wallet/purse, but zipper broke within the first few weeks :("
2.0,"Not sterling. Pretty,but not silver"
2.0,I’m glad I didn’t pay full price
2.0,It's an alright shirt
2.0,Did not look like the picture.. And was ordered an x large..Came in extreamly small!<br />Had to give it to my 9 year old grand daughter!!! Learn American sizing..
2.0,"Love the look! However, the brim has a small piece of gray piping that is coming off after only 2 months.  Very short life of the hat"
2.0,too large and thick
2.0,A gust of wind caused me to flash all of the strangers that were standing at the sidewalk with me. Enough said….. I returned the blouse. Oh and the sequence was flying off the blouse like glitter.
2.0,"Belt came small, when I walked the buckle would squeak, and then one day the buckle detached completely."
2.0,Popped soon as i tried to put them on
2.0,"I absolutely love this bra, but it is already fraying at the seams. ☹️"
2.0,Incredibly small narrow strap and it looks like plastic not leather. I thought it would look nicer.
2.0,It was bought for church but it was to tight and it didn't look anything like the picture
2.0,The fit was great but not very durable. I got them for my son to wear for basketball  and he got a jole in the knee the first time he wore them
2.0,Cute but wayyyy too small. Fit like a crop top on me. Material is also very thin. But it’s really cute!
2.0,"This is cute on the model but looked extremely boxy when I tried it on, the sleeves were really huge. Just wasn’t for me. Returned."
2.0,The way it was showing on pic . Totally wrong too large there is no sense to wear . 🙄
2.0,I use these for mt biking. They are just too tight for my comfort. The quality seems excellent
2.0,looks good but it constantly unbutton.
2.0,"Didn't like the fabric, too thick for a pant. I ask for a free return but didn't work it and so return cost was half of the price pant. So I will try to sell it on offer up"
2.0,"Not what I expected, also I felt they didn't represent the product accurately. As you view the heart, no where does it show that the back side of the heart is black? From the front as advertised its a beautiful Pink, but when you turn it over it black."
2.0,"Still working on loving this piece. It's pretty boxy, definitely oversized. With a lightweight top and leggings, it's the most well-rounded look. Definitely cannot pull off the top as pictured, it's very large, boxy and short."
2.0,"The dress wasn’t a wine red, it’s more of a true red. It was really cute, but the skirt wasn’t as flowy on me as it looks in the pictures. Overall a cute dress. I would have kept it if it didn’t have the rip in the waistband"
2.0,The wrong watch was packaged by the manufacturer.  The stop watch portion is very temperamental if it works or not.  It does however look decent enough for the price.
2.0,"The sleeves were way too short.  And, the stomach area was at least a size too big for a medium.  The rest fit loosely, but ok.  The material seemed warm and still lightweight.  The short sleeves were a deal-breaker and I returned it."
2.0,It is not what I expected.  It is made cheaply and you have to charge with a USB the shoes in order to wear them.  The charge went out on one shoe almost immediately
2.0,"I bought this dress but will be returning it.  The material is not great quality, and while the top of the dress fit nicely, the skirt was sewn in such a way that it didn't fall straight, but instead flared up at the bottom in odd-looking way.  In general, not great construction.<br /><br />I bought a size small, and it fit me fairly well.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 125 lbs, and typically a size 2.  A size 4 likely would have fit in this dress too, although the dress is definitely not floor length or even ankle length.  It ended mid-calf on me, which wasn't the length I was looking for."
2.0,Didn't expect much and got it. Ring very lightweight and the stone moves. Fit was a bit big.
2.0,Doesn’t stay fastened.  Cheap!!!!
2.0,This product is low quality and smaller then aspected. This needs more work to make this item better quality.
2.0,Just no...my daughter kept going back to her old slippers that couldn’t fit no more she didn’t like to wear these...They fit so weird
2.0,The fit was some what small for my husband and they tore in the seat the very first time he wore them. Love the design but not the quality of the pants.
2.0,"These pants are a thin material.  I do not believe there is spandex in the material.  There is virtually no tummy control.  They do nothing for my figure.  I am not overweight, but always appreciate looking tighter.  They came in an envelope with no indication of an order, no order form, no information for return-nothing.  Thankfully, I remembered I had ordered these from Amazon.  I will definitely be returning.  DO NOT RECOMMEND."
2.0,Waist fit as measured but the bust didn't even though I went up a few inches. Also the fabric was a little cheap and cheesy looking. Not lined and not my taste.
2.0,"The jacket looked nice and was just what I wanted at a good price. However I followed the size chart exactly, taking every measurement carefully and the jacket was about two sizes too small. At least the return is free."
2.0,"Nice piece of jewelry other than there weren’t enough threads on the ball/bar. Kept loosening and falling off. Lost it within a week of owning it, no matter how tightly I thought I screwed it down."
2.0,The fabric is terrible and feels similar to a cheap Halloween costume. The chest fits well but the rest is more straight fit than A-line and too tight for the size.
2.0,Hardly any Windows were in this packet. Plus the price tag of $1.50 was still on it. That's not what I paid. Disappointed.
2.0,Smaller dial and belt size
2.0,wasn't red as expected
2.0,"Was not impressed by this one.<br />Looked nice on site , but  in reality it’s very  little fabric<br />Have decided I don’t want to purchase anymore vintage dresses after this one. I kept it anyway but was disappointed."
2.0,Ok. Not really what i expected but guess buying sunglasses online isnt easy so...
2.0,"This mask is a horrible fit, it is too large for your face, it doesnt have enough metal at nose clasp to hold it on or near your nose, so it slips and goes up into your eyes, I only gave it 2 stars because design was pretty, they definitely need to redesign this mask, wait to buy till redesigned,  because it will not do any good for you to use to protect if it doesn't cover properly"
2.0,"I liked the style and the pockets, but I’m 5’7 and it didn’t even hit my ankles. I would also size up, I’m normally a large but it was tight in the chest."
2.0,They’re pretty cool... sadly the broke in half the same day I wore them! Poorly made...
2.0,Ordered an XL but fits like a Medium.  I like the shirt but have to return it.
2.0,"I was excited to receive the earrings, but sadly disappointed in the quality.  I expected them to be thin, but these are feather light, very soft and flimsy, more flimsy than wire wrap. They keep bending out of shape during regular wear, after only a couple hours. Ive worn them twice (to work) and have already had to reshape them half a dozen times.  They are cute, but definitely not worth $40."
2.0,This was supposed to be a DRAGON but it looks like a blob of colored metal! Better quality
2.0,Ended up being skin tight<br /><br />‘Meh’ quality
2.0,"I gave 3 stars because the sizing is way off, I looked at reviews prior to ordering and it seemed ordering my normal size would be fine however it didn't fit, I feel like a large may have even been to small. the material and quality seems good it just doesn't fit me at all and with zero stretch to it, it just wasn't comfortable."
2.0,"If these fit, they'd be great. I'm 5'6&#34; and 155 lbs and usually a size 6-8 or M in most pants. I went by the reviews and ordered up a size to an L and they were a little snug in the waist (but doable) but the bottom of the pant leg wouldn't go past my ankles. Like so many people said, these fit in some areas but if you have any sort of calf muscle even ordering up a size won't work. Sadly, I'll be returning these. Even though they're cute, the sizing and proportions are bizarro. Whomp whomp."
2.0,"This is actually a very nice skirt. The reason I'm only giving it 2 stars is because it's made for young girls (about 10 years of age). It was in with the regular adult skirts and it didn't say girls (that I noticed). What I did notice is that is nicely modest, which our girls need today. I liked the fabric. If you have a girl then I think this skirt would be great for her!"
2.0,"It is actually yellow, not off white..."
2.0,I did not like this and the backing was difficult to wear.
2.0,The dress was nicer than I thought it would be however the lace neck was torn in a few places so I returned the dress. It was a nicer quality material than I had anticipated but arrived ripped.
2.0,It’s very nice thanks
2.0,These pants are full of black dye. They stained my other clothing.
2.0,"No me gustó la calidad de la tela. Picaba y era de mala calidad, terminé regalandola."
2.0,It took more than a month to get to me. It’s pretty poorly made strings everywhere some of the seams are loose and something very sticky inside on a piece of loose fabric I was able to cut it off. Runs very small but I figured it would so I bought a larger size it fits but I don’t think it looks that great. It wasn’t very expensive so …
2.0,"I received these clip on's and tried them for 4 or 5 night and early morning darkness drives.  Although they did change the lights in my eyes from white/blue to yellow, I still had issues with brightness and glare.  As I drove I would flip them up and down as I viewed oncoming lights and saw that they made no real difference.  Maybe my eyes are just that sensitive.  Maybe the 'polarization' was not correct on them?  I do not know.  They seem like quality sturdy lenses and they came quickly and were packaged nice.  They look good too.  They simply did not work for me so I returned them."
2.0,These stockings were too tight and not what I thought - perhaps for another person.  They were too tight around the calf.
2.0,"Think we may have received a size larger than order, which may be the reason why the slippers were too big for my daughter. After enduring the white residue from the slippers coming off and adhering to the feet for two days, we decided to return the slippers. We were hoping that the white residue would eventually stop peeling off, but didn't know how long we would wait for that to happen."
2.0,While this is a beautiful brooch and compliments any outfit my only qualm with it is that the clasp does not stay closed. Many times during wear it would fall open leaving me prone to getting punctured by the sharp end of the pin. :(
2.0,"This dress was hard to put on. I had to figure out how to lace the back and then realized that you have to put the dress in first and have someone else do that for you.. the straps have no adjustment so the hard cups for my boobs were practically right below the collar bone. Boobs should not be that high, they ended up just getting squished. The color was off so I am attempting to return and still waiting for a response from the seller. You cannot just return like other packages but have to wait for the seller to send you the return address."
2.0,"Don't put too many bills in it.  If you do, the clip pops open."
2.0,Way smaller than I thought they would be - might be O.K. for a young girl.
2.0,"It's not that it's ugly because it's not.  It's just cheap feeling.  The beads are plastic so it has no weight to it, and the tassel is bent and doesn't lay flat.  Had I paid $7 for it I wouldn't complain, but it's not worth the money as is."
2.0,"Super disappointed, definitely not meant for busty girls. Even an xl was WAY too small and not in a sexy skimpy way, in a squishing and bulging way. Bottoms were fine but didn't like them enough to keep with the top not fitting."
2.0,Very disappointed when i recieved this shirt for my son. The shirt is very thin and it made with very cheap material.
2.0,"Cheap material,  still a cute dress though.  It was a lot smaller than the size chart made it out to be. I ordered XL and it was more like a M"
2.0,"just did not fit. need to reeturn it, how? THERE WERE NO PAPERS FOR RETIRNONG INSTRUCTIONS/"
2.0,"Don't understand the great reviews here, this is not a good product for working out... It's material is too warm, the size was also a bit big for me but that is not the real issue. I don't think I can work out with this, it's not the same material as regular leggings you buy for working out"
2.0,"Super sturdy case but very bulky. The volume buttons did not work properly, try to turn volume up it would go down. I even used my fake nails to work the buttons but no luck. Charger wouldn't fit well either. It looks as pictured I got the zebra print."
2.0,I liked the print and style of this dress but the fit was not good. I even bought it bigger than I usually do and it was still a little small on me.
2.0,"I got a 2XL.the shoulder opening hangs a lil low and my bra side could be seen and the lace didn’t exactly camouflage that upper side boob fat so unfortunately I will have to send it back. I’m 210, 6’ tall.<br />My husband loved the color and the appearance but he could tell on my face that I wasn’t feeling the fit of the shirt. It’s cute though just not for my body shape.<br />Be cute to wear with leggings or skinny jeans because<br />It<br />Hangs low enough."
2.0,Backs of earring are not secure. Only wore them twice before I lost them.
2.0,Really cute in the box but not on me
2.0,the seller was great to work with but not really happy with the shoes in general.
2.0,"Didn't fit on kids. Too big. Bought for 4-5 year olds. Kept falling off. Wish they specified this in their description. Out of seven, they should have made some smaller for the young ones. Can't use."
2.0,"These were way too small to fit my lobes, so my husband is using them, and unfortunately I noticed that the gold colour wore off almost immediately which is a shame, they were exactly what I was looking for style wise"
2.0,Very firm support sports bra. I love that you can adjust the straps and the band also. The only issue I have is that the velcro from the strap adjusters on both sides hangs over and cuts into my under arm and inside of my arm. I would trim it but it would cause the seam to come apart. If not for that it would get four stars.
2.0,"Please dont waste your money and time, these earrings WILL turn green in less than two weeks"
2.0,"I got the shirt and could barely get it on, Seemed like a medium instead of a XL large"
2.0,This broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,I am a definite medium and this fit like a small. Returning. The material is very thin as well. I’m giving it 2 stars just because I like the colors
2.0,"I did order a medium.  I did not look like the picture.  I looked like an elephant with sagging skin. Maybe a small would have fit me, but I wanted it to be loose over a bathing suit. Maybe the gray was not helpful. The material is slippery.  It did not MakeMeChic!"
2.0,Cheap hat!!! Doesn’t look good at all. Horrible color.
2.0,Haven't worm but they look like what I paid for them lol
2.0,"These cases are extremely lightweight and have lots of room. I was impressed with the wheel system and was of rolling the suitcase either upright or as a pull along. Unfortunately, they are made of a thin plastic and or large one cracked after only one plane journey and also has a broken handle. They shouldn't be used for frequent travel on planes as checked luggage.<br />All but one suitcase had the locking mechanism break upon receipt of the package. It would've been nice to have the zippers hook into the lock bit it seems to be fairly fragile."
2.0,this 3X blouse was way too small i always wear a 3X my niece wants the blouse because it almost fit her small frame
2.0,Weird fit. Lose in back and tight in sleeves. Returned it.
2.0,Fell apart after 1 wash but worked for a Halloween costume
2.0,"I absolutely loved the way the pants fit, but I have to return them because the length just isn’t long enough for me. I am 5’6 and 150 lbs and got a size 6. The way the actual pants fit was perfect and I was so sad that they weren’t long enough."
2.0,"The kimono fit like expected. My only & biggest complaint is that the fringe falls out easily. Just shifting in a chair pulls them out. The string is just looped through, not secured to the rest of the garment."
2.0,I'm rating this as a 2 because of the garter belt red strings attached to it is longer and I only have very short legs. I would not recommended this for anyone unless you have to be really tall up to 6 ft tall.
2.0,"If your head is the circumference of a 7-year-old child's, this will be the perfect headband for you. For those of us with normal-sized heads, this can only be used as a slightly oversized wristband or a bicep warmer. In a pinch you can use it as a tourniquet or a headache-inducing torture device.<br /><br />The quality and design is nice, but it's too small for this smaller-than-average-sized male."
2.0,"Very cute dress, but runs about 2 sizes smaller & very thin material."
2.0,"Meh its was ok, it really isnt going to do any slimming for anyone"
2.0,It is very cute but runs like two sizes smaller than expected.
2.0,The bust area and sleeves were extremely tight especially for an XL
2.0,If they were small and short they would be great
2.0,"It’s sticky, but too large for me. I looked on the description and ordered a “C” cup because I am a 36C, but too much is covered by the bra. I’m returning for a smaller size."
2.0,"The wallet arrived very quickly, but is has a large rip on the side and it will not stay clasped. I gave it to my 4 year old to play with."
2.0,Cheap and very small. Lesson learned you get what you pay for.
2.0,"NOT stainless steel OR mild steel. This is galvanized steel, which is not nearly as durable, nor authentic. Cheaply made, there are no expansion rows on the back or chest, so it's a tight fit if you have broad shoulders. Length of sleeves and body are good, they fit me well but the shoulders and chest are a little tight (5'9'', 180 pounds). Feels like 16 gauge steel, which is average. I don't hate it so much that I want a refund, but it is definitely not as advertised."
2.0,"Small and tight barely fit my 3 month old, wore it once, now too tight. I did like the flowers though"
2.0,"After wearing and waking 3 times, underwear began to fall apart with holes showing where the back meets the front in between the legs."
2.0,"I really was looking forward to ordering more of these. The crochet detail is lovely and delicate and looks homemade in every good sense of the word. BUT, even though I sized up, this cardigan runs at least two sizss too small. Being a plus sized lady there isnt a size to fit my arms and breasts. If the sizing were accurate, I would be back to purchasd every color and pick up some light summer maxi dresses to wear with them in the hot Texas summer."
2.0,The quality of the material did not meet expectations.  Looks inexpensive
2.0,"It was the perfect size for small wrists, until it quit working.  I'm really bummed, it only worked for a month."
2.0,"Cheap, not worth the money.  Tiny as well."
2.0,Lovely design but very weak product.
2.0,"Material is cheap, I liked the colors but it has weird pockets that won’t stay flat. I’m wearing it to bed now. I don’t recommend buying this."
2.0,They are pretty and good color. I can only rate them a 2 because the fit is different across the 6 pairs. Two were woven so tight that I could hear the treats tearing as I pulled them around my heel. Two other pairs were perfect . Last 2 were tight in the toe area. Very weird and disappointing .
2.0,Bought for mom and bracelet turned. Seller would not return email about replacement.
2.0,These rings were big on my finger.
2.0,Gave a 3 star because the earring is very pretty but they don't hang on have to keep checking and putting them back in position
2.0,Not as soft or comfortable as I hoped. Fabric & seam interiors were too rough for sleep shirt as I intended.
2.0,Item missing some large bead accents. Not worth contacting and the time to receive a new one!
2.0,"If you are tall (I am 5'10"") then you may have trouble with this... it just doesn't have enough stretch to work at all for tall people. I ordered a small. It fit on the waist, it fit on the ribs, but the distance between the top half and the bottom made it literally impossible to cover the top half of my body without having NO coverage on the bottom.. Cute though."
2.0,Horrible fit on me. Looked nothing like the picture on my body. It seemed like the waist was much higher than in the picture.
2.0,Didn't work well
2.0,The end pieces came unglued after 2nd time wearing it.
2.0,My son is a 7.5 and M is too big. Recommend going one size down.
2.0,Not as described in picture
2.0,Nice bag but I am disappointed because I bought about a month ago and have carried two weeks when the strap broke. The D-ring on the.side of bag broke. Not where sewn to bag but the leather broke in half. I am NOT happy.
2.0,Broke the very first day I wore it 😢
2.0,The jeans are cute but the size is way off. I got this in a large but it fit more like a small. I have size 10 pants that fit better than this and I couldn't even button up the pants because the hole to stick the button in wasn't even cut out.
2.0,"The product functions well, but the color faded quickly over one season.  Still usable, but looks more worn than I would expect after 4 months outside."
2.0,The  silver rubbed off almost immediately
2.0,Look the part but not good
2.0,The material is very soft and stretchy. Waist band is perfect. 2 stars because the crotch design bunches up and creates a massive cameltoe that ruins the leggings indefinitely. Will be returning for a refund.
2.0,Not sturdy. I loved this key chain when I got it. But it broke last week.  :(
2.0,"Very nice dress, good fit, but came defective:( have to return."
2.0,"Liked the look for my sister. She loves these kind of earrings. Usually wears the smaller ones. Like the hearts and peace signs. However, she tried to put a pair on, and one broke the very first day. We were both disappointed."
2.0,Not long enough like what is shown in the image. More like hits you at the hips.
2.0,Looks better in the picture. Wouldn't buy it again.
2.0,The chain turned brown pretty fast.
2.0,This is a toy at best. I realize it's inexpensive but was honestly expecting more. It feels like it was part of a cheap Halloween costume.
2.0,"They scratch very easily, and the yellow glares my eyes too much."
2.0,material too heavy
2.0,"Works well as a windbreaker or light jacket, but definitely not a rain jacket."
2.0,The picture online is so much nicer than the dress in person. I wanted to like it but sadly I returned. I’m 5’7 and the side split was a bit indecent
2.0,It's adorable and I like how it looks in the picture but it doe snot fit right. Dang non Asian ears. :(
2.0,"Ordered an xl, 2xl came but it fits like a large! Super disappointed because it does seem to be go material and made well.<br />If you decide to order I'd go up 2 sizes."
2.0,Way bigger than you would expect.
2.0,Great look and feel but only lasted for about five weeks before falling apart.
2.0,"Really cheap skirt, but pretty much what I was expecting for how much I paid.  Sized up to a large (5'4'' and 140 lbs) and it fit well, but one of the buttons fell off the first time I wore it.  Might fix it, but will probably just buy a better quality version of this skirt somewhere else."
2.0,"Had to return, lest I be punched in the mouth by the lady I love."
2.0,Sizes were too small and the design of the costume was poorly thought out. The teeth on hood are sharp and pointy and poked my kids in the face due to their placement.
2.0,This set is super cute but you definitely need to size up. The waist in the pants are tight and the shirt is as well
2.0,"I had high hopes for this product judging by the reviews, maybe I got a defective pair, there are snags in already and I’ve only worn them once after a day of owning them...disappointed"
2.0,"Ordered my size, but the legs are really long and wide. Kept tripping on them. Ordered another pair that was a little smaller,...same problem, but then the waist was too small. Be careful when ordering your size. Waist and length are not true to sizing."
2.0,These were a lot bigger than I thought.
2.0,To closed in around neck. Doesn’t lay right
2.0,This the size you want but the $10.00  ones are much better quality.
2.0,The snowflake earrings are very cute but I only got 1 pair instead of 2 pairs of earrings and there is no longer a photo reference to show the options. The pair I did receive is very cute and I’m sure my daughter will love them but I have to purchase another pair for my other daughter now. It was the whole point of buying a 2 pair set 🙄 I also can not find anywhere to contact the company to inquire about this.
2.0,"Fairly decent lightweight sweater, but arrived with a big stain on the front...pretty unacceptable for a &#34;new&#34; product...  Returned..."
2.0,This was bought for my husband and he was disappointed in the product. The belt occasionally slip out from the back of the buckle and the tip on the insert end of the belt catches on clothing and has partially come of the belt a few time. We don't think we will be buying this product again. Sorry.
2.0,"They are described as fitting 5.5 to 8.1"". My wrist is 6"" and these were way too big."
2.0,"Wing accessories were not included at all. Cute sunglasses though, and I really do like them a lot. Wish they had wings as advertised- I would keep them. Will be returning."
2.0,It was cool but it came without a mask
2.0,"To get the look in the photo, you'd have to fold in down and inside.  If it moves at all, it doesn't look like that.  Not printed correctly"
2.0,"This is unwearably large. I ordered a small and I'm pretty sure it's bigger than a medium should be. I think it would be a durable work shirt from the feel of it, but the fabric is too heavy for summer and the sizing is just ridiculous."
2.0,"I have multiple pairs of Crocs from sandals to to flats to clogs, and I love them all. This is my first pair of lined Crocs, and while they are warm and cozy, and I love the fleece inside, I am very disappointed with the complete lack of arch support and rock hard footbed - not at all what I have come to expect from Crocs. I definitely won't be buying another pair of these."
2.0,Bought around Christmas and on of them has broken already.
2.0,Fits well but they dont stay in place.
2.0,Very comfy but they collect EVERY fiber in the air
2.0,These shorts are completely see-through
2.0,"I liked the look of the band, but it broke after 3weeks of wear. I won't buy it again.  Garbage!"
2.0,Nice packaging. Comes with tools to punch your own holes. OK quality for everyday use. What's bothering me is that it has this ugly mark on the corner of the head (I thought the pattern was the plastic wrapper before I open it but it's on the metal)
2.0,"1. Not the pattern I ordered. 2. Does not have enough protection. 3. Quality not good. 4.Johnny Was, name not on it anywhere."
2.0,"This is a nice chain, but more for a man than a woman.  I didn't feel the description on the website made it easy to determine the size.  A 'dainty' chain of this type is more what I had in mind.  Returned."
2.0,The sleeves were off. It wasn't worth it for me to keep it and have to pay to shorten the sleeves. It's beautiful in the picture but doesn't work in reality.
2.0,Not as shiny as the photo. And the rubber on the left side is too indebted so it hits my brow n
2.0,"It is a piece of fabric from downtown with a couple of black strings sewn on to tie around your neck. If I saw it in person I wouldn't have paid more than $12 for it. Size wise it's short and not a lot of fabric. If you're buying for a kids costume, or a sexy women's revealing costume, it will for nicely. But I stand by my statement of $12 to $15 max retail cost."
2.0,I was swimming in it looked like a clown
2.0,i ordered a large which is the size i normally wear. Would fit a 12 year old better
2.0,"I wear 3X and that is what I ordered, this fit like a 2X for a 5 foot 6 inch person."
2.0,cute picture but the fabric is heavy and the dress felt bulky.
2.0,"The bulbs were HUGE! They are super cute, but too large for normal sized or child sized ears."
2.0,"Will companies please start making sport/sleeping bras that fit LARGE busted girls? I bought the size for extra large ""girls"" but I guess mine are extra, extra large?  I'd just like something to wear on hot nights to keep from sweating to death!"
2.0,Sizing way off give it away
2.0,Very pretty on but lost 2 stones the first time worn....now useless.
2.0,"Cheap, thin material. Ordered a size up and still fit snug and was a tad awkward. Returned"
2.0,"This is cute but after washing this, the skirt was a wrinkled mess. Wish it was a different material used because with a baby it’s hard to find the time to iron their clothes. It’s probably something that will be put to the back of the closet because when I’m ready to get her dressed I’m not going to want to pull out the iron."
2.0,"Not a huge fan.  I’m sure they’ll fit someone else but didn’t fit me at all. 5-10, 190lb, athletic build. They also seem fairly cheaply made to be honest and I’d worry they wouldn’t last going through the washing machine."
2.0,Not made of good quality but for the price you can't beat it.
2.0,"Ordered a medium, received a large. Even for a large they where HUGE (tent like). Looked like granny panties out of the packaging. If you're slim definitely order a size down.<br />Keep receiving one size larger than ordered. Returning again."
2.0,"This is a no from me. The fabric is super low quality. The shorts are so ""high waisted"" that they pull up basically over my chest, it was laughable trying them on. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the top is fine."
2.0,"Nice but not for going out, ok just for your house intimacy.<br />It's very short and runs small, fabric is thin and it looks cheap made."
2.0,Item is very small.  Order a couple sizes up then normal.
2.0,I’m normally a size 14/16 and wear a large in pants. I ordered an xxl and I can’t get them over my upper thighs. The xxl might fit a 10/12. The fabric is also very shiny but the design is really cute.
2.0,It's tiny and the chain barely fits around the neck... Bought it for a costume... Would fit a ten yr old girl just fine. Barely glows.
2.0,"As a watch enthusiast and collector, I'll own up to spending far more time than might be sensible scrolling and searching Amazon for bargains or interesting time pieces. It seems regardless of the focus of my searches, brands like OLEVS and Oupinke (or OPK, TDO and JSDun) tend to pop up in all the time with any number of representations of their ""luxurious attributes."" I decided to pick up a few samples from the aforementioned brands - which appear to be mushroom varieties from the same manufacturer - to see for myself how well they hold up to the promotional come-ons.<br /><br />The accompanying photo reflects two watches from this manufacturer's stable: the blue sunburst dial styled TDO and a similarly styled OLEVS model. For practical purposes, the only differences I can determine between these two minimalist watches are the style of royalty crown used for branding and the OLEVS model has the brand name stamped on the clasp. Beyond those cosmetic effects, in terms of overall look and functionality, they're essentially interchangeable. In each instance here, the relatively lightweight watches (86g) each features a mineral crystal, sunray type blue dial with dauphine hands and lumed stick markers although the longevity of illumination is less than sufficient. While it is not uncommon for quartz movements to have a highly audible tick, these watches have one of the loudest movements come across. For reasons that can only be speculated, the watch highlighted on this product page (as well as associated models from this concern) are shipped without crown retainers so it's a toss up whether they'll be received with dead batteries or minimally, batteries that will have an inordinately reduced life span. The watches have snap off/on pressure closure stainless steel back case covers that is basically a consistent indicator of low end yet from the half full glass perspective, not much of an issue to replace if you have the appropriate cover replacement gadget.<br /><br />From a cursory glance many of these inexpensive models from each label seem relatively attractive if one just wants a piece of wrist decoration that happens to display the time, they'll do under limited conditions at a very affordable price. There's no point to closer examination as at this price tier, there's also not much that should be expected however similarly styled watches of comparable quality could easily be found at an even lower price point. That said, I tend to believe these watches are of comparable quality to a host of popular designer branded watches employing effectively the same quality of materials but carrying substantially inflated retail prices.<br /><br />While both of these watches employ an arguably accurate lower end Japanese quartz movements which I suppose is the primary objective, the day/date complication seems consistently misaligned in the display window. These are two position pull/push stems with adjustment of the day or date being accomplished by clockwise/counterclockwise adjustment at the first position and time adjustment at the second.<br /><br />Generally, there doesn't seem to be a major amount of differentiation between the OLEVS, Oupinke (OPK), TDO or JSDun watches. No matter which branding you decide on it's probably a good idea just to avoid any of the purported stainless steel bracelets and opt for the arguably more dependable leather bands. The coated stainless steel bracelets are susceptible to scratches and appearance will diminish rather rapidly. These watch, not unsurprisingly, have hollow end links which tend to rattle a great deal although the coating reduces the rattling effect enough for this bracelet finish to be a better choice than this manufacturer's silver tone or gold tone stainless steel bracelets."
2.0,"I order black and when I put them on it looks reddish purple.  Nice design, just color is way off."
2.0,"... I was looking forward to it....but when it arrived , I tried it on...too snug.....and the material makes it look so cheap!...I noticed it was made in China......it is so different from the photo....I would not recommend it...I am keeping it because  I have returned two articles.....maybe will gift it!"
2.0,"These are subpar.  The positive is that they don't have that big clip in the middle like the other lenses and are therefore lighter and less goofy-looking.  The negatives are: (1) they're pretty tough to put on and take off because they don't have a clip - the mechanism is made of plastic so I don't expect it to last long with constant removal, and (2) the flip up feature doesn't work well - only one side of the lens flips all the way up, the other side just kind of hangs at an angle.  I may have just received a bad lens, but I don't want to go through the trouble of returning it."
2.0,"These shirts look great when you first get them.  However, after washing & drying ONE time, the color fades and it shrinks significantly.  Maybe if you  hang dry you could reduce the fading and shrinking?  I won't be ordering again."
2.0,"I normally wear a 14/16.  I could not get the zipper all the way up.  Also, I knew it was going to be short on one side, but note that it is really short."
2.0,Shoes are true to size in length but don’t fit at the ankle..
2.0,My daughter love it at first. then she start complain about the shoes being very heavy and not very stiff and she start have back pain from it. not very comfortable for everyday use.
2.0,"The shirt arrived quickly and in the size requested. However, it is about 3 to 4 in shorter than the photo. The bottom hem in the front is even with the button on my jeans. The two pointy corners on either side aren't much longer maybe 3 in. Therefore there is no swing or ease to the garment. It is also fairly thin but the colors and print are very vibrant and sharp. I wanted to wear this as a shell under a sweater for work. Not. I will be returning this."
2.0,After 2 times wearing it  It tore
2.0,Do not like material
2.0,Hard to get info on the panels and no cover to protect personal info.
2.0,"Was missing one of the smaller earrings. Not what I thought it would be,"
2.0,aggravate reflection.
2.0,It’s a box shaped dress and see through. Depending on the occasion that may or may not work for you. My advice is to wear with a belt around your waist. So you don’t look like an rectangle.
2.0,"This dress is so so so so cute for a one time use. I love it so much that I’ve bought it twice. However, no matter how you wash it (cold, hot, cool, delicate, hang dry, normal dry) it shrinks. Every. Single. Time. So it’s so cute for a one-two time use but the material will mess you up."
2.0,Looked like lingerie
2.0,Had to return it.<br />Followed all the measuring in the sizing and bought the size I expected would fit and I could t even fully try it on. I was afraid of damaging it and being unable to return it. The sizing was that far off.
2.0,"The elastic for the ponytail hole sticks out and you can see it.  I can’t return it, because I had already given one away."
2.0,"The color was not really gray. It was more of a lilac color, which I actually didn't mind too much. I personally didn't like the fit though. It felt/looked as if the hem at the waist was too short so it fell almost right under my chest (not very flattering). Wish it had fit better. Quality seemed good though."
2.0,Bad design.  The ankle area is very narrow
2.0,Received a tangled messm struggled to untangle it only to discover the chain was broken and non-repairable.
2.0,"Thin, loose threads all around.  Should’ve read the bad reviews first.  Cheap shirt that amazon should not be recommending."
2.0,Great idea but doesn't work as well as I had hoped. The spiky part doesn't grip the bra brand too well which means it doesn't tighten the band very well. It works fine as an extender but cheaper extenders can be bought. I found the plastic part that is in contact with the skin to be uncomfortable.
2.0,Great while it lasted. Clips over time have become “loose”. Meaning they don’t clamp as tight as when new. The problem here is they don’t stay clamped onto your shirt tails therefore unclipping. Pain to constantly having to goto the bathroom to reclip.
2.0,"Runs really small, had to return"
2.0,"I made a mistake when I bought these I though I was buying navy polycotton aprons and they were jeans.  I decided to keep them and washed them.  The aprons go out of the washer still very stiff but they had plenty of loose threads,unwoven fabric all around.  They are too long for me.  They are not of soft jean material at all."
2.0,Unfortunately what the picture shows it does not represent what i purchased im very upset with this purchase wont do that again the item is poorly made and the back ground is not the same as what is shown in the picture
2.0,Gold faded away turned silver quick
2.0,It was for myself and I take a large and this was like a medium and it didn’t show on the site when I was looking at it to buy it that it had  all the flowers on the back of this shirt yikes I hate this shirt ☹️☹️
2.0,High rise falls down after 2 squats. White print shows undies. Fit was okay.
2.0,Smaller than expected (I bought a size up) and the straps ripped after a couple of wears. At least she looked super cute while she could wear it!
2.0,The scoop neck is very low and the dress is not a midi. At 5'4&#34; it is above my knee.
2.0,My son was super excited to receive these items as part of a graduation gift but after a month the clothing have shrunk two sizes!! It is now a belly shirt on him 😩
2.0,"this is for bible and book of mormon, too large for triple. one handle ripped right off the first Sunday my boy used it."
2.0,"Ive been using the Gotchya since January. I recently purchased this wrist band, and it snapped right in and looked good. After 4-6 hours of use, the Gotchya fell out at some point and now I have a worthless strap."
2.0,"Super cute belt! But the smallest size was VERY large. Very bummed by the sizing...<br />for reference, I am 5’4” and 125 lbs."
2.0,Well I love the dress but it’s definitely wasn’t a 4x and it was super short on me but my mom who wears a 2x it fit her perfectly so I gave it to her
2.0,Just got my second set and clamp wouldn’t stay on. After checking I found the plastic teeth on the clamp was missing. Started a return but will definitely buy another. My last one worked very well.
2.0,These are very small - looks like something a kid would play dress up with.  Would not order for an adult to wear
2.0,"I am 5'9&#34; and usually wear size 4 or 6, yet this legging is too small for me. This legging is only for women around 5'6&#34; and wears XS to S. Despite the unfortunate size, the design is chic."
2.0,This bra looks cute but even an xl was very tight and gives a uniboob. Would not purchase again!
2.0,"I actually loved the charm, but the connecting hoop broke and the charm smashed when it hit the ground."
2.0,Over half of the candies were off when it arrived. Band is not very sturdy. It is top heavy and needs a sturdier band.
2.0,Kind of hard and even rough- tough if you’re in between sizes. Should have spent extra on one from a specialty store.
2.0,The jacket fit well on top. The bottom was tight.
2.0,"Also, it's defintely not all cotton. I'll be returning this. Again, it's just a giant rectangle with no sleeves or seams, and just two cords that tie around the waist."
2.0,The material on this bow tie isn't great. It doesn't tie nicely with a good dimple. I would recommend spending a bit more and getting a better one.
2.0,"Really love the style and size of the earrings, but found it very frustrating to try to put on and take off.. They will not hang facing forward like door knockers, instead they turn to the side.  Look at the hooks carefully before buying!"
2.0,Style is cute. Runs too small and fabric is clingy. Returned item
2.0,"These are cute, but are scratchy! You don't notice it a whole lot as you out them on, but within a few minutes your feet and legs really start to itch. If you wear other socks under them, you will be fine, but that was not what I was looking for when buying them."
2.0,Got what I ordered. It tarnishes rather quickly but hey it's steel.
2.0,Arrived with a split zipper. Leaving for vacation and no time to return. Very disappointed!
2.0,"This dress is very clingy and thin, shows everything.  There is no structure to the fabric.  I didn't realize it had pockets and they way they're sewn it makes them stick out, not flattering."
2.0,Velcro wore out fast.
2.0,Does not look at all like the picture. The fabric is cheap and the collar doesn't lay like it does in the photos.
2.0,It's ok. U got what u paid for. It's better in picture. The gold link looks like it had faded. Didn't want to return it because it will cost me maybe another $7/8. Not worth it. So I'm keeping it.  Buy something similar to ur neighborhood mall.
2.0,"Easy to assemble by myself, seems well built. Suggestion: Buy your sandbags or weights  BEFORE you put it up so you have them immediately.<br /><br />UPDATE: The sandbags didn't work - it blew over in the wind, the umbrella ripped and now it's worthless. Don't buy a product where the umbrella is not replaceable."
2.0,Sleeves are short. Tight around the bust line.
2.0,"I’d been buying these at Walmart and thought they were the best masks. When they ran out, I purchased them on here on Amazon and they’re just not the same—my glasses fog up and they don’t stay in place as well. Maybe they’re seconds?  I just checked, and they’re back in stock at Walmart for $8.44 for 50!"
2.0,I have a large four year old that these were purchased for. They are very breathable but don’t have much stretch. It is hard to get them over his head and that would be okay with me if they would stay up over his nose when worn. He has a melt down every time we try to use these because they don’t stay up at all!
2.0,"Slipper didn't fit and hurt my foot. Will be returning.<br />Actually, I like the style but not a good fit."
2.0,Still debating returning this. It's got the boob circles that don't fade at all. Bought for our maternity shoot. Maybe darker colors would be better but this just makes me look so much bigger and frumpy than is legitimate.
2.0,Muy bonito pero muy corto en la cintura no se ve de largo como lo muestra la foto😩👎
2.0,Not what I expected feels and fits like a cheap hoodie not worth the 28 dollars I paid . Not buying any more Joe’s products over priced low quality goods
2.0,"The socks fit like they should, no seams in the toes are wonderful but the heels slide down into your shoes. Thus I can't give it any higher of a rating."
2.0,The material was not what I expected.....Hated it...
2.0,Returned this dress because it was too small and didn't really fit right.
2.0,"I was excited to receive this and give it to a friend as a gift! But I was seriously disappointed! The key ring was cheap and the faces are a little distorted! I didn't give it as a gift, I actually had to go shopping the day before the friends party to find another gift! I should have sent it back but I didn't want to spend anymore time on it!"
2.0,It’s kinda really cheap quality can find better at the dollar store
2.0,Photo looks better than the actual item.
2.0,"I've gone to kickboxing classes at the gym for years, but the routine on this video is too hard to follow."
2.0,It seems like this should be made to stay on your wrist even after taking off the hair tie... the opening is way too big so it's unwearable after you use the hair tie.  And I have larger than average hands/wrists.  This is not useful.
2.0,"Cute, but way too small. I'm a 34C and this barely covered my breasts. Would be good for running, but I don't think a sports bra would fit under it."
2.0,I’m 5’8 155lbs and ordered a M. This dress was extremely short (I was super uncomfortable) and the tie did not hit the right stop on my body. It was not placed in the appropriate spot to accentuate one’s waist. I have a pretty decent torso and it hit way to low on me. Would not recommend.
2.0,The coffee color is not what I expected. I don't think it is coffee color as labeled.
2.0,Even though I bought it at twice the size I wear it was still a little tight in the bust. I usually wear a large. I bought 2X. I can fix it so I kept it. It was made pretty good. Material is stretchy. Style is flattering. Added a belt for one look and 70s black and white necklace and earrings for an other look. (plus leggings and boots)
2.0,Very bulky on a small wrist.
2.0,Doesn't give u a option to pick a size
2.0,"Very poor quality... was not sewn together well when I received it, the as soon as I began using it, it started falling apart right away."
2.0,"So if anyone look at the pictures all the hems are crooked!!!! No joking look at the review pictures and the ad pictures...who would ever make a crooked sweater?<br />So I am 5'11"" and 215lbs. These are Chinese sizes so I ordered a 5x and it fits great."
2.0,"Ordered this package last month for Halloween and was extremely disappointed by the sizing. First off I will give props and say that I received all items and that the quality was decent but the sizing is usually smaller than what it shows. I recommend ordering a size up, if your really bulky then possibly two."
2.0,it was somewhat small in the waist but my issue is that it's not kente cloth but silky. very disappointed
2.0,"I ordered prime shipping, so the earring arrived in 2 days. I already had bought these earrings before through another app, and they were just like the picture. These, not so much. The pink is not a rosey pink like in the picture. It is like a baby pink/pastel color. The faux gold just looks like shiny yellow plastic. I am going to try to return it, but I don't belive it would be worth the wait."
2.0,"Clingy, the back part hangs awkwardly, and overall the shirt looks 1-2 sizes too small."
2.0,product now as pictured. expected the inside to be black but instead it was zebra print.
2.0,Cute design but too glossy. They were cheap enough to where I kept them but I don't see myself wearing them.
2.0,I did not try on after seeing poor fabric quality. Returning item.
2.0,Not happy with how the inside facing that runs long the front of robe on both sides.  It is wide and does not stay put like it should.  Thinking about stitching it down so the robe hangs better.
2.0,So adorable but the back clasp doesn’t stay secure and hurts my kids head a little
2.0,"It’s a nice shirt, I got what they call an “XL” it’s a maybe a Medium. I like my shirts loose. 👎🏻"
2.0,The earrings were nice but much smaller in person
2.0,"Despite all the technology they use to reduce odors, this bag does not work for strong odors and because of that I honestly don't see a difference between a regular backpack and this one.<br /><br />edit: after a couple years the zipper broke"
2.0,Way to small!!! Ordered xxl per description and needed a 5x. My little thin friend could not fit in it either
2.0,I have a wide foot  the toe area gave me a bit of trouble.
2.0,arrived smashed in 4 places
2.0,"Very cute dress, fit was good but had to return because the material was very see through. I wish it was made with a little thicker material."
2.0,"I loved these masks so much when I got them. They were very comfortable, flattering, and thick but the design was good in that it let you breath well.<br /><br />However; I just washed some of these and am so sad! They shrunk very badly in the wash, and now barely fit into my face. I don’t know if I can wear them again. I washed these warm water and normal dry, so not sure why this happened. Not only that, but all the fuzz is stuck onto the front too. In the photos I compare the size of the washed mask to the mask that wasn’t washed, and you can see the difference quite apparently<br /><br />Not sure if I can can a replacement for these, or at least a refund. I seriously wanted to love these masks."
2.0,"Gave only 2 stars because they're well made & I felt no pain after using it the first time.  But, after using it a few days, it gave me an allergic reaction & even marked my skin.  That said, I stopped using them but the marks are still there unfortunately."
2.0,"I thought this watch was the &#34;normal&#34; Casio with 4 buttons (two on each side); however, the watch only has three buttons making the watch more difficult to set and use than I thought.  I returned it and will look for the traditional 4-button model."
2.0,I picked an Small size and it fits as Large.
2.0,Poor quality shirts. The women’s is about 3 sizes too small. The sleeves and neck roll up due to the poor quality. Very disappointed in this purchase.
2.0,Shirt runs smaller than I expected
2.0,It wast like the picture
2.0,I received the wrong item!! Please contact me!!
2.0,"Captain Marvel top - I was sent a Large instead of Small. Pretty disappointed considering I purchased this with plenty of time before Halloween. = 2 Stars.<br /><br />**As far as it being a Large, this will fill my husband perfectly. It looks true to size. = Perfect fit."
2.0,Shoe is my correct size but the straps are too long. Cant wear them because of this but wish I could because otherwise I like them.
2.0,Does not fit the bracelets the description stated it would.
2.0,UNEXPECTED
2.0,Ordered a 2x size (which I am). Garment is way too big.
2.0,This does not fit the size head advertised.  It is quite tight which makes me think the model used is very very small.  Anyways it would be ok if it were even close to the right size.
2.0,"I knew they weren't going to be real turquoise but they look soo cheap that I can't even wear them. They also aren't as bright and pretty as the picture. The pair I got are muddy, dark and yucky looking. Not a very pretty blue."
2.0,Cute but damaged after 4 wears. My daughter is super careful and not rough. I’m shocked that it’s coming apart so quickly.
2.0,"I bought this for my granddaughters birthday. The only thing she asked for. First day the strap broke and the several of the end caps came off exposing the plastic rod which put hole in the umbrella. When she opened it she love it, it is adorable just not a good quality product."
2.0,Color was not like the picture
2.0,The image is very cheaply ironed on and pixelated! It feels like it could rip off at any second.
2.0,I would pass on this if you are shopping.
2.0,The tool that comes with it broke first time trying to change out the straps
2.0,Only flown for a few weeks already tearing loose around the grommets
2.0,"I love the look of the dress, and the feel of the dress, but I ordered a size up from what I normally wear only to find it’s still a lil small.  I was disappointed."
2.0,"The color, make and length of this dress is very nice. It is a bit big around the chest and i need to wear a cami under. I purchased a small & wear a 34B. My biggest complaint, is that this dress looks like a floral robe that you’d wear to be cute with your brides maids before the wedding... not something you’d wear in public."
2.0,Too tight on chest and waistline and too loose on hips
2.0,It was to tight for me.
2.0,"Overall, low quality. The inside zipper broke right away and every time I opened the suitcase, all my items fell into disarray. Also had other issues. Buy something else."
2.0,Cheaply made but cute . Just make sure to cover in clear nail polish or elae its sure to make ur fingers freen also they are a bit small
2.0,"Watch out for these types or style earrings because the smaller back or ball will become loose and you'll lose it. There is no way to replace a lost backing or to tighten it to keep from losing the back.<br /><br />123Set, Kyle, TX"
2.0,Lace was not secure to dress. The dress was too large in the shoulder and chest area. Beautiful right color but Lisa was presen The dress was too large in the shoulder and chest area. Beautiful white color but lace was stuck in the zipper.  I can see through dress when it is on.
2.0,The bra has creases in the pad part. It looks awful if you wear it under something white.
2.0,Too long even to very tall people.
2.0,"Ragweed pollen really bad - I was really looking forward to getting these glasses. Great price, nicely made and packaged, but they don't block pollen any more than my regular glasses.  There's enough room for my finger to go between the glasses and my cheek, and a breeze will easily flow.  May be great for blocking splashes from straight ahead, but offers little side protection.  I have $1.50 glasses that don't look as nice, but do a lot better job!"
2.0,"Thought it was cute and warm blinking colored Christmas lights, but it's irritating, annoying white flashing LED lites that remind me of a road hazard marker...the hat itself was ok, but kinda thin and cheezy for 8 bucks."
2.0,"When you receive these they will be in a box that supposedly protects the lenses. The issue is when they were assembled the team working on them either had all the lenses in a single bin allowing them to scratch one another or the finished product was thrown into a bin to be packaged later allowing the same thing.<br /><br />So of course I'm ecstatic to receive damaged merchandise. Honestly it wasn't so bad that I couldn't use them, however I'll be staring at a computer screen so I'd rather avoid the eye fatigue this will cause instead of preventing it.<br /><br />The wood side pieces are made from low quality wood with tons of inclusions making it look pitted. The finish is terrible and adds a wavy toilet yellow hue when viewed under florescent/ lighting. So if your looking for a cool nickname at the office these are for you.<br /><br />Additional notes...<br /><br />If your eye bridge/gap is greater than 50cm this won't fit well.<br /><br />If your hat size is larger than a 7 it will start to be tight. You can bend it to fit to some degree, but 7 and 5/8 people will have zero hope.<br /><br />Middle piece is made from hard plastic/resin and compliments the glasses nicely. It allows the piece to be sturdier as well."
2.0,Shoulder part was a little too big so it looked awkward
2.0,Really SNUG!!!!
2.0,I am size 4 in a dress and usually wear small. Jeans I vary bw 3-5 depending on material. This skirt I bought in L and it fit like S so be careful purchasing the exact size you wear. The material that’s placed inside the bottom of the skirt so it flares out is completely terrible... The skirt was folded when i received it and now the bottom of the skirt doesn’t lay properly when u wear it because it’s creased/crickled everywhere along the bottom. I tried ironing it and placing the skirt under heavy objects to straiten the material but nothing helped... Please reconsider what materials you are using for that part of the skirt because for me it was a wasted buy...
2.0,The sweater was used and had someone’s hair all over the sweater.
2.0,I sized up and was still tight in my chest area. Also sleeves are completely see through so it did not look right on me
2.0,"Who did you create these for, children? The sizes are ridiculous! They aren’t adult sizes, it had to go back, cute but …."
2.0,Very short chain
2.0,Whats with the pink tint???
2.0,"This top is not a sweater. It is an average thickness long sleeve shirt. Also, it smells horrible!"
2.0,Pros: The hat is well-made overall. I have a large head 24.5 and the hat fit fairly well.<br /><br />Cons: Limited water resistance. The 'crown top' fabric is extremely paper-thin which means the hat will not last long.<br /><br />I will probably return this hat. I am not satisfied. Do not buy this one.
2.0,The Nike symbol began to peel after wearing only once.
2.0,"Its see through, but everything else is awesome about it. Why is everything always see through!"
2.0,the bottoms material rolls up and look horrible. and it looks as if it was stitched wrong and off set..
2.0,The sole of the shoe was longer than other shoes I have in the same size and the strap from the ankle to the toe bubbled upward.  Not a good fitting shoe :(
2.0,Based on the measurements chart my daughter is an X-Small which was not available so she opted for the small size. However when she tried it on it was a little tight on her. Good thing the X-Small was out of stock.
2.0,Leather is showing signs of cracking after only a few weeks use. Buckle has sharp corners that snag my shirt.
2.0,"They were great and true to the right size..<br />Of course everyone shops solely based on the picture. And they looked very realistic.. But upon getting them you can definitely tell it's just a plain little sticker, the shiny exterior does not look true to picture at all. (The lens of the earring)"
2.0,"I was delighted when the bracelet arrived. However, after several months of wear it began to tarnish and not has hints or brass. Disappointed. Don’t waste your money. Save up and get the real thing."
2.0,Cute dress but ordered the smallest size for my friend and it still fit like an XL
2.0,"The color is nothing like what was pictured. I was very much looking forward to these because  of the beautiful, almost pastel like color. Instead they look more like what gas does when pooled on the ground.  I like the 3 different sizes...2 should work well for me. They do open/close easily...almost too easily.  I worry they will open on their own and fall out."
2.0,"It looked great on the model, but when I tried it on it just looked like a big pillowcase.  Not much style to it."
2.0,"I liked the dress and it fit well, except that it clung too closely to my body, almost like see-through.  Because I felt it indecent for me to wear, I returned it and had no problem with return and refund.  Thank you for letting me try."
2.0,"Looks nice , there are other better watches in the same low price range ."
2.0,Awkward shape.
2.0,I am 5'7 and this does not come to the floor at all it barely comes to my ankle as soon as I put in over my head and pulled it down it was torn at the seam. The price should be 10.00 dollars not 20 I am sending it back.
2.0,Nice cap but the iron on is low quality.
2.0,"I got the yellow one thought it was a great summer color, however, it is completely see thru! I like the outfit just get a dark color."
2.0,Not the size they said it was - fo sho!
2.0,"I'm normally a small in tops but this was really loose on me. It also felt really cheaply made, I could justify paying $5-7 dollars for it, but not $17."
2.0,"Cute, BUT the one I received isn't layered like the pictures. Both strands are even and to tighten one trying to get the layered effect won't work because the chains are so short. Fyi, if you don't have a slim neck don't get this one!"
2.0,Cute but I can't wear them for long they made my ears inch the entire time I was wearing them.
2.0,"I saw other reviews about the waist band being small,  but I ordered thinking I will just open up, pull out elastic, and put longer elastic in if that was the reality.  Well, yep. Really small little waist on the medium (I wear a 6/8). And, unfortunately,  it is a stitched waist...multiple rows of stretch stitching...so no way to adjust it. Had to return. PS, the inside...sorry, but the soft brush back 'flannel' insides...I sure couldn't feel it when I reached in. I used to have a lovely satin pajama set with snuggly  fleece inside, and I can tell you, this does NOT have anything close."
2.0,Way too small. I sent them back
2.0,"Just got them and when I put the on the first time the spikes killed me, but i wore them for a few minutes and they got better.  I was doing some cooking and as I stood they started hurting again...took them off and when I was finished I took a heavy jar and used it to mash the spines down and rolled it over them...when I put them back on they were perfect...just the right amount of pressure and massage on the bottom of my feet.  I got them because I suddenly got Plantar Fasciitis and heard these sandals would help....and I believe they will!!!<br /><br />I have been wearing them for 4 days now off and on and they are still very painful....I was going to return them and just saw that they are not elegible for returns.....EVEN THOUGH I BOUGHT THEM WITH PRIME!!!!  I thought that was what PRIME was for....now I'm stuck with them!!!  If you are thinking about them to see how they feel on your feet...DON'T!!!  they are NOT elegible to be returned!!!  if you want a shoe like this that is very comfortable go look at and buy the OKABASHI SANDAL....i have had a pair of them that I didn't wear often and was looking for something to comfort my foot some...put them on and it was wonderful....give them a try!!!!"
2.0,"Good quality Material, stylish, nice waistband and all, but.... Way, WAY off on the sizing. Bought for my 19 year old, who is normally medium,  even wears some clothes in size small. Depends on the brand..<br /><br />Got these in XL (it was the only size left), and they wouldn’t even go over his thigh. And this Is before I ever even washed them!<br />They are like a boys xl, not Men’s!<br /><br />At least we had a good laugh wondering what a size small in These would look like!? Lol"
2.0,"Ordered a L/XL, but was sent a S/XS. Amazon took it right back (kudos to Amazon!). Wasn't as heavy as I thought either. Would be an OK robe, but not sure why it had such high reviews???"
2.0,I was very disappointed with this product. It looked totally different from the pic. The ears are small and the hat does not stand on the head like the pic.
2.0,Color is off on the center stones. Looks brown.
2.0,A little disappointed in the dress it had a lot of potential to be really great but the tutu not bring fluffy and thick like the photo ruined it. Also the layers are all over the place 😩
2.0,"Cute dress, totally see through"
2.0,Colors were not as bright as in the picture. I sent it back
2.0,"Loved the sleeves and the material of the dress. However, the body doesn’t have a “shape” so it clings to you."
2.0,"I'm very dissapointed with this dress, because I'm usually small, and I check my measures with the size chart to confirm that I'm small, but what I received was huge. It looks like a medium or large. The dress is very nice but there's no way I can wear it. Won't buy again to this seller :(."
2.0,I usually wear medium in their tops but this one was way too small and tight. Would recommend going up a size on this particular top.
2.0,"Heads up, this product runs small! Do refer to the sizing chart, but keep in mind to get a size or two larger than expected. I bought an XL because of my 5'7&#34; height and 40&#34; hips, and even so, the swimsuit cut into my rear unattractively and the shoulder straps were incredibly tight!<br /><br />Despite my troubles with the size, the product itself is attractive. The hip bands are vibrantly colored. If you're lucky enough to get a size that fits you well, you'll definitely get compliments at the poolside :)"
2.0,"It is impossible to pull the band back to get the peg out and take the watch off. I think the band will be gone in a few months because of how hard I have to pull to get it off. Also, the &#34;night light&#34; is terrible and doesn't illuminate well at all. And the main ink display isn't dark enough. Sometimes I have to squint in broad daylight to see the time<br /> Two stars for being nonetheless inexpensive and disposable."
2.0,They are pretty but too small for my hand.
2.0,This is not a loose fit top.  It’s very clingy.
2.0,"Bracelet is really cute upon first appearance, but started tarnishing within hours of wearing it. I don't think it had even had contact with water at that point when I started seeing orange spots. I know it's not sterling silver or stainless steel, but I expected it to last longer than a couple hours. Not worth the price. I must say I'm glad I bought it from this seller though and not another one who was selling it for $35.00 instead of $15.00."
2.0,"I just got these,  I'm a bigger guy, and I don't like them, I ordered my normal size,  they feel about a size to small,  to tight in the crouch and the legs."
2.0,"While the Steal Your Face is bright and a decent size, it is not embroidered as stated in the description. It appears to be a thin iron on material that will most likely crack and peel with regular use."
2.0,After first wash material beaded. I'm glad I only paid 13.00 for it!
2.0,I have a small chest and this fits so tight on me. Size up.
2.0,Beautiful ring but after only wearing it twice one of the stones fell out. Now it’s worthless to me. Super bummed about it :(
2.0,"These fall off my wrist from time to time, even when I try to tighten them.  I could probably live with that if the rubber band stayed on the bracelet, but it does not.  So I just don't wear them."
2.0,"This is advertised as a Two-Pack of scarves. It is not. It is only one. That being said, it’s a beautifully done scarf, and is actually better quality than I expected for the price. However, I also thought I was buying two scarves for $24 so that’s why it’s better than expected. I’m giving two stars because the product is nice and what it should be, but it’s only half of what was advertised. I’ll be returning the two that I ordered because I needed four for a World Cup party and now won’t have what I need."
2.0,"Beware ladies, these pants are extremely small."
2.0,Pretty rings but unfortunately they hurt to wear.
2.0,Ordered the black. Looks like a dark gray. Not high waisted. Weird fit. Looks and feels bulky.  They are super warm but not worth it
2.0,Tapers and tunnels are very short and should not be used for stretching.  2 stars because they are exactly as described.
2.0,Very small. My daughter was very disappointed.
2.0,Grommets fell out after light to moderate use.
2.0,Nice band but had to wait super long to get it. It did not even fit the gear s2! So the adapter pieces were useless. But for the price not bad
2.0,"Great fit and cut, but it is super see through!!!"
2.0,Great quality and workmanship but sized way too small . XL was more like a medium had to return them.
2.0,"It really was a gorgeous piece of jewelry to wear to my daughter's wedding, however, I wore it for about two hours, hugged someone, and it fell off my neck and when it hit the floor, a stone came out.  I'm very disappointed in the product, overall, and would not recommend buying it unless you ensure all the links are tightened, which is a lot of work for the price you pay."
2.0,It was too big. I'll send it back.
2.0,"I really like this kimono, however I am disappointed. The one I received had a big rip down the seam of the sleeve."
2.0,"I bought this for mine and my husbands pregnancy announcement photo shoot, he ended up still wearing it since we didn’t have time to buy another but the sleeves were more like quarter sleeves than long sleeve, other than that the fit was fine. But he most likely will never wear this shirt again."
2.0,"These gloves don’t hold up very well. I’ve worn them for about 2 weeks and they’re already starting to fall apart. They’re purdy comfortable, but thats about it."
2.0,Disappointed. Love the concept but material is stiff and my phone is hard To remove from the phone pocket. Also the Snap keeps popping open exposing my credit cards. Expected more from an Oprah‘s favorite.
2.0,Smaller then what I expected
2.0,"I ordered two pairs of these sweatpants on the same day. Same size. Got two very different products, so I guess I'm doing two different reviews (edit: I cannot submit two different reviews, so I guess it will be  a two-parter).<br /><br />This is for the navy blue pair:<br /><br />First, the fit is weird. They are snug through the hips and thighs, but extra long. I have long legs, so I can wear them, but if you need a shorter inseam, they probably won't work.<br /><br />Second, the material is horrible. Really rough - like burlap. I washed them and used fabric softener hoping it was just sizing or something, but it isn't.<br /><br />I guess I will use these to work outdoors. They definitely aren't the comfy lounge pants I was hoping they were.<br /><br />Now for the mauve pair:<br /><br />Excellent fit, buttery soft material. I love these pants! Hard to believe they were sold in the same listing as the blue ones. I guess I will add a star since I can't review them separately. Whoever is doing quality control on this product needs to step it up a bit."
2.0,I am disappointed!  The fabric is lightweight & does not meet the quality of something to be worn as an apron dress. It was purchased as a gift & I am too ashamed to give it to her.
2.0,"Wayy to small. I'm 5'4, 160 and normally wear a large. Bought an XL in hopes that it would be oversized. Definitely not."
2.0,This was way too large and long.
2.0,Well the earring arrived broken off the post. The bracelet is only for thin wrists. Needed my husband to bend it out a bit. But I did get several complements.
2.0,Wouldn't buy again. Came very wrinkled and was way too small from the size.
2.0,Dress is beautiful and great design EXCEPT the sleeves/shoulder area are incredibly small/not proportionate.
2.0,Cute but a lot bigger than expected.
2.0,A little disappointed with this top. I wanted it to be loose and float but I feel like I'm drowning in my normal size. Doubt a size down would make mush of a difference as the material just doesn't hang nicely
2.0,I was so disappointed because the back was covered with non-advertising to show off.
2.0,"The proportions in the fit of this suit are way off. I’m 5’ 6”, 196 lbs, 36DD, size 12/14. Ordered an XL. The bottom half was difficult to get on, like shape wear, but then when I got the top part on, it pretty much fell right off my shoulders. If you’re extremely top-heavy or inverted triangle body shaped, this suit would work for you. Otherwise, don’t bother."
2.0,I the clip doesn’t hold anything anymore
2.0,"Wouldn’t recommend. They do their job, but they would scratch against my leg as I walk and give me rashes. Worst of all, they broke after around 5 uses."
2.0,For the price they feel cheap.
2.0,Too Small is not what the description say
2.0,"much smaller than I expected as it only holds six reg cigs.  It is not worth the money it cost, it's not sturdy."
2.0,"It has come to be my understanding that these cheaper, 'knock-off' clothes purchased direct from China need to be ordered several sizes bigger than what one would normally wear.  I ordered an xl, which is what size I always wear, and I am not even going to bother trying to get it on.  It is obvious from pulling it out of the bag it was shipped in that it is going to be way too tight.  The sleeves even appear to be sewn very small and it is not dress length when held up against me.<br /><br />The dress appears to be well made otherwise, the fabric is soft and not scratchy or see through.<br /><br />Another complaint is that, should this item and others from this seller, arrive and be too small - even though their size chart indicates that it should fit - you will have to pay for the return shipping.  In my opinion, that's not right.<br /><br />I recieved this item at a discount for my fair, unbiased review.  Rest assured I only recommend products my family and I use, I have no problems giving poor reviews for poor products - and great reviews for great products! - regardless of how great the discount."
2.0,"Don’t waste your money. Not what’s pictured. It was more of a top than a dress, with cheap material and missing the strings to tie it."
2.0,"My battery died after less than a week. Is this typical? Because that shouldn't be normal. I'll replace the battery, but I'm not happy about it. A new watch should have a battery that lasts far longer than a single week."
2.0,I really love the designs on the bands but the connectors are metal and hard plastic that tend to break easily if you bend you wrist too much. I have broken over 3 bands and do t think there are any other styles that work with this unit. Buyer beware didn't know the upgrade in the fitbit I was going to have to buy new style of band
2.0,"Fits beautifully and oh so cute but after first use noticed holes in fabric, seams coming undone. I wish I could give more stars but due to quality it gets a low rating."
2.0,To have for the ladies
2.0,Looks beautiful. However glass fell off face within 2 weeks. I went ahead and used a bit of superglue to fix it. Very cheaply made
2.0,"Oh man, do these do the exact opposite of wicking odor away.<br /><br />They fit like granny panties which isn't altogether bad if you're looking for full coverage. But wear these to work, sit all day, and holy hell, do you have one stinky crotch area by the end of the day. These don't keep you dry, they don't leave you smelling good, and they make you wonder if they actually amplify the smell so that people around you get a whiff.<br /><br />I only wear these when all my other underwear are dirty. I'd rather wear my stained cotton panties before I put these back on. Blergh. Hard pass."
2.0,"Material is very thin, almost see through. A nice layering piece for fall."
2.0,Too if dress is very thin and does not fit nicely :(
2.0,Broke after a month of use. Very cute though. If you adjust it daily or remove it nightly it will not take the constant bending.
2.0,Pendant is great. Chain is grey almost black in places not great at all
2.0,Could not wear.it is cut smaller than says.try bigger size
2.0,The zipper broke off the second time I wore them.
2.0,"This hat is very big; the head portion (cup) feels too big; yes, it does have an adjusting band, but even so, it looks very large. The brim it truly floppy and does not have much body.<br />Other than that, the striped design is beautiful and I'm sure a lot of girls love it.<br />Unfortunately my hat was packed scrunched up and kept the wrinkles even after I tried to flatten them out.<br />I cannot wear this hat, and at such low price, it is not worth paying the return fees. I donated it."
2.0,They bunch up.
2.0,I had ordered thease just for the case and i got it in the mail a few days latter and the case is black and grey not black and white unhappy oh and the sunglasses that come with it dont even fit in the case. :( unhappy
2.0,"Attractive design, good weight, but is cut skimpy.  A more generous cut would certainly enhance cut and comfort."
2.0,Posts were off center
2.0,I love the style. Although one thing really threw me off (see the first picture) this appears every now and then in segments but not on either end. Additionally the only option was a size M which sucks for me because I'm small. The quality is on point though and I have yet to find a belt with the simple weaving and this is the closest I've found. If you examine it closely there are a few places that look a little damaged but won't affect the belt's job in the long run. Odd how no one's written a review for this belt.<br /><br />I'm no leather expert but it sure does smell legit. The smell will fade though (obviously).<br /><br />Overall it's okay but not amazing. It seems like it's as close as I've gotten to the weaved leather belt idea though so I'll probably be keeping this in the long term. (Belt end to buckle is 44 in long)
2.0,"Pretty flimsy and easily scratched - pass on these - I think you can find better glasses out there,,,"
2.0,Bracelets way too small.  Can only wear 2 of them and they are tight.
2.0,Looks nice but difficult to put on your wrist with the two separate magnetic straps.
2.0,"The center charm (the part with the saying) fell out of the circle rim on the first day.  Definitely a case of ""You get what you pay for"".  Would NOT recommend it to others."
2.0,"Color and words were just like the picture, but I ordered two sizes larger than my normal size and it was still uncomfortably small on me."
2.0,too small for face
2.0,"I order large and it didn’t fit me,I gave it to my son 😂"
2.0,Low quality product. The material is very cheap and low quality.
2.0,easy wear out
2.0,"Looks, feels, and is silly cheap."
2.0,"I love the pattern, and the size fit well.  However, the length is very strange.  I'm 5'9"" and it was still too long to be considered a midi dress, in my opinion.  Hit me at a weird lower calf spot that looked strange.  Also, the fabric is not what I expected; it is a heavy, slippery fabric."
2.0,its heavy and does not stay up in place. looks cheep in person too.
2.0,Not only was this shirt too large but it was made in a horrible material. The fabric was so awful that is was unwearable. It was similar to the fabric of most tents.
2.0,"I found the dream sweatpants (OK, I alter them a little) at American tall dot com. Not an ad: their sweatpants are long and well made."
2.0,Cute but fit smaller
2.0,Not my style wrinkles easily. I will probably give it away.
2.0,Too loose. Keeps falling off
2.0,They are a little shorter than average which may be okay if you have a smaller waist but that is not my case
2.0,"The fabric is very very thin.  It came quite wrinkled  - I am not sure the wrinkles aren't permanent.  And worse the bodice had a permanent flaw in the fabric.  I sent it back.  A shame, as I loved the style.<br />I would not recommend."
2.0,"This dress has very vibrant colors, but fits small."
2.0,"very pretty but did not drape well.  Too short for its weight.  Notice that is a beer can in the picture, not your neck.  Also itsmis rough acrylic."
2.0,Very cheap but what can you expect for the price right?
2.0,Color way off.<br />Expecting Red came in more brown.<br />Disappointed.
2.0,I have a nickel allergy and despite these being “hypo allergenic” earrings I still had a reaction :(
2.0,It was just a hair to big and could not squeeze between the lugs.  I'll keep it though.  It might work on something someday.
2.0,"Bikini Bottom is Great. Bikini Top is Lousy. The bottom is well made and fits perfectly for the size indicated. Double sided (so two layers of fabric throughout). But the top has stiff padding that, unlike most padded tops, cannot be removed, and is like two sponges in water, dragging the top down off the breasts when you try to actually swim forward in water."
2.0,"For the price, It was very nice but just way yoo heavy for me. It was made out of real leather."
2.0,"Aesthetically, very nice. So it gets 2 stars for style. I got multiple compliments in the few(4) days I had it. Unfortunately, one of the plastic pieces that clasps the band into place on the fitbit snapped after the first time I changed it, rendering it completely unusable. Also, the leather band is just a leather covering over the actual band and is stuck together with some sort of adhesive. It was already coming apart after the few days of wear. Important to note I did not get it wet, but I did run and walk my dogs while wearing it.  Even though it's a fashion band and certainly not the band I'd use while working out or swimming, I'd still expect it to be durable enough to be able to wear while doing some active things since it is made for use with an activity tracker."
2.0,Fix your product
2.0,"Umbrella looked great and sturdy but after the 2nd time using it, it broke. Very disappointing."
2.0,I loved the pattern. But if you are 5 foot 1. This dress might not be for you. I am currently getting it shortened.
2.0,the zipper
2.0,"Bought this item for the zipper to remove the shield. Instead of a zipper, there’s cheap Velcro. Misleading description and cheap quality product"
2.0,Color is beautiful but the stitching was way too high on the sides. Cuts off the circulation of my pits.  I will have to sew again it myself and hope it fits. Material is nice.
2.0,Pretty necklace. I would've loved to wear it but broke before I could even try it on.
2.0,"It fall apart too easily, but it was easy to put back together"
2.0,"It came with a real plastic-y smell that I had to air out for a couple of days. Its a lot shiny than I expected as well. When I first got it, it came really flatten, so I had to form it to the way it is pictured above.  Not a small bag either, maybe a little bigger than an ipad air."
2.0,"Sometimes you get what you pay for...I don’t usually write negative reviews, but I was displeased with the weakness the magnetic latch and the wire-string ends scratched the back of my neck making it intolerable. I ended up going to a local craft store and made my own lanyard for less than $5."
2.0,"Maybe I need to use these more often to get used to them but the hair color just sits on top so you have to be careful not to drip it, and they place color exactly where you put them so that really makes things take longer. I prefer a bristled brush."
2.0,This shirt was cute but too small.
2.0,won't stay on waste of money and time to receive product. SHAME
2.0,"Normally I am a small or medium. I ordered these in medium and they were WAY too snug. Reordered in large and still too snug to wear even around the house. The fabric is very thin and cheap ~ similar to Walmart or cheaper material. Yet another item that doesn't offer free returns, need to stop shopping online...."
2.0,Cheap boots they were not sturdy at all and kept falling off while walking. Threw them out after one week. Will not buy again.
2.0,Very cute out of the bag. Too tight and faded after one wash in cold water.
2.0,Appears to be longer on bottom. Definitely shirt is banded. The picture appears to be a different bottom than what I received. Shirt in picture appears to be more Jersey material. The one I received was not polyester.
2.0,Unfortunately the clasp broke the first day. I replaced the clasp with a new better one.
2.0,There are better options. The red frames glow in the sunlight it's distraction. When you put them on the awl just isn't there.
2.0,"I love that it has hole on the top for ponytails but for the love of everything holy, it’s too tight on my head. I have a regular size head and the elastic kinda squeezes my forehead. It’s a bit small in my opinion.<br />For kids, perfect. Not for adults."
2.0,Tint started to peel shortly after buying. Would not recommend
2.0,The skirt is a very stretchy material and dries quick. Pleats and colors are different than shown in pictures.. but not mad at the outcome
2.0,Runs extremely small! The Asian XL/ US Medium was more like a XXS. I had to return it.
2.0,"One sock tore putting it on for the first time. Haven’t used it. Other pair fits ok. No washing instructions available. Put it in washer and it deteriorated in quality on the seams. Sizing was also off significantly, ordered the XL size and it was still to tight. Very difficult to get on and pull off without fear of damage to seams or fabric."
2.0,"the part where your foot goes fits fine but the heel of the shoe is awkward, it doesnt really reach all the way to the ground as if it's too short for the shoe. also the smell of the shoes is so strong and unpleasant and it took almost a week to air them out. the buckle on the strap was also very difficult to do and undue.<br /><br />overall they look nice and they do technically fit but not really worth all the negative aspects."
2.0,Two stars for a nice fit and a pretty red. Three stars off because it was made of a fragile dress lining material. Some thin fabrics can pass for dress material. This one cannot. Unwearable for me.
2.0,"The bow tie nice goes around my neck but it is so big that it just angels around my neck like a necklace. Meanwhile, the tail's band is so small that I was only able to get one leg through it. There's not way the tail will be able to sit around my waste. At least the horns fit nicely."
2.0,I sized up on this dress and the fit was fine but material way too clingy. The pattern was cute but sadly had to return.
2.0,"Well, it's not for big girls. I'm 5'2"", size 16/18 and 40C, and the biggest size was way too small to really even lace up properly in the back, and the boobs were out all over the place. There's definitely no way to wear an actual bra with this without it sticking out the sides and being highly visible everywhere else. It might make for a cute swimsuit cover up or I guess a dress for a tiny person with no boobs. But not for any curvaceous ladies for sure."
2.0,Way too much material. Had to return. It was cute from the front but view from side was terrible.
2.0,This watch band is a great way to lose your watch.<br />It is convenient to put on and take off but it is not secure at all and can easily fall off from a slight bump or shift.<br />DO NOT WEAR IN THE OCEAN OR A LAKE where you could lose your watch.
2.0,"I bought one for each size Nook. I like the materials and the wake function works well. The Nooks fit perfectly as well with well set control, microphone, and speaker openings.<br /><br />However, on my 7 inch model case's tab that is meant to create a stand is sewn on upside down, which voids the stand functionality quite effectively."
2.0,Wouldn't buy again. Little piece that connects to the glasses broke on the second use. Womp womp.
2.0,"I am a 36B and ordered a 36B it fit just fine as far as cup size and band size, but my breasts (even being as small as they are) were not supported with any lift at all, especially bc you can not adjust the straps whatsoever, so instead they just felt droopy and unsupportive. I will not be wearing. If the straps adjusted it could have easily been five stars. I gave it two stars for the right amount of padding and lift and correct size, but not being able to adjust straps, which made is not fit correctly in the most important way, caused me to give it only two."
2.0,"Not sure what to say. very nice glasses, but did not last ??"
2.0,Do NOT use with ANY epoxy it will turn blue around the edges! They are sturdy and strong. Shipping was fast but as far as using to make epoxy/resin/dimensional magic pendants save yourself.
2.0,"the bottoms were very 'cheeky', too small. I liked the top but it did not fit well either. I returned the item."
2.0,A little big. Print was a little messed up and I feel like it’s overpriced. Will be returning.
2.0,"Look, I like small, dainty jewelry  BUT, these earrings gives ""dainty"" an ENTIRE new meaning!!!  I could not even believe just how tiny these earrings are!!!  As you can see in the photo, which took me 2 days to take the pic, buy a card reader, transfer the pic, etc., you can BARELY see anything there!!!  You mostly see EAR and maybe a little glisten of something shiny there, annnnnnd that's about it!!  I gave 2 stars because after I did literally fetch a magnifying glass to be able to look at them in the ear, they are cute, and too much trouble to send back for the price.  However, knowing they would be more practical for a fairy, leprechaun, or prissy little gremlin, there is absolutely NO WAY I would purchase these again for myself, nor would I gift them because I don't know any fairies or gremlins!  Don't waste your money!!!"
2.0,Fit is strange... wide in the legs and even shorter than expected
2.0,The rings turn your fingers green super fast and theyre really small so make sure youre aware that theyre midi rings. Other than that theyre cute.. Just add some clear nailpolish so they dont turn your fingers green
2.0,"Thanks to the other reviews we knew to order an XXL which fits like an large.  We expected the Red Camo to be red,  black,  white, and gray but it turned out to be red,  white, green, and navy."
2.0,I ordered an XL and when it got here the tag said XL but fit like a Medium!!!! The fabric looked cute though and seemed to be non see through but luck y for me it fit my friends and she bought it form me!
2.0,"So cute, so disappointed!  While the pants fit, they are cut strangely somehow and feel weird, uncomfortable.  For reference, I’m five feet, 122, slight/medium build, these should be more than my size but with the strange cut they were tight in the thighs when sitting or lying down.  If I slept upright they would have been good!"
2.0,Had to keep pulling them down.
2.0,To Crammed around top part of foot
2.0,Nice price for the hat. However it arrived with the stitching undone. Sadly I will have return.
2.0,cute but thin and small
2.0,"This sweatshirt is cute in the picture but when it arrived it was a very cheap material, no stretch, I even sized up and it was still tight. I wore it once and it balled up all over chest to where it is embarrassing to wear it now. Defiantly don't recommend if you are looking for something comfy."
2.0,Super cute but way small. I ordered a size larger than normal and even that was too small.
2.0,"The product looked nice before opening up  fully. Once I pulled it out of the clear plastic I noticed the material was a little frayed along the seem. I washed the face mask and went to wear it to work, after 10 minutes I noticed a gas/fuel like smell. I switched to a different mask and washed it again.  Next time I tried to wear it the fraying was tickling my nose and smell was still there. I would not buy these again."
2.0,Not a plus size fit. Looks better on the screen then in person. Cheaply made
2.0,It’s not the same as it should be for original Plotock. Cheap material and some cheap print. Sorry. It’s not what I expected.
2.0,"It states red, but looks like a faded rust color in picture.  But it came a vivid Rust color. Weird fit on the top and to short for me. Im 5' 6""."
2.0,I love the color.  The only thing I don't like is puckering at the seams.. It looks like I stuffed my bra.
2.0,Boxy
2.0,"Top fits great and would give 5 stars, but the price is expensive for the material and the hat and necklace were not in the shipment, so definitely NOT worth the money!  Disappointed I can’t contact the seller."
2.0,(chemical smell)  jewels fall out easy.
2.0,"Beautiful material and well made. I normally am an xlg, would of had to order up at least 2 sizes. Gave to my daughter who is S/M"
2.0,The skirt is very nice but it was a struggle to get it up over my bum. I ordered the XL which is bigger than what I need or so I thought.
2.0,Thought they were ok but one broke in the bag! Not worth sending back.
2.0,Weirdly shaped...very wide...doesnt look like the shape of a foot
2.0,Not long lasting and doesn’t hold up in the Washing machine
2.0,"I am 5' 8"" tall & slender typically size 6 or 8 or M. I ordered large (size up) and it fit well on the body (would not be able to order my normal size) with exception of the waist (belt) was too high and sleeves too short. Had to return. Quality was acceptable, just the fit is off."
2.0,"I ordered item 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear but still did not fit, runs smaller than expected, and chains popped very easily. I would say garment is poorly manufactured not necessarily the seller's fault but the manufacturer I would say. I donated the jeans to my neighborhood goodwill so not a total loss."
2.0,"This bra has plastic around the top and bottom.......works great to hold the bra in place as I didn't have to adjust once.  However, upon taking the bra off that same plastic left welts and in some areas removed patches of skin."
2.0,Good quality but it fits tight compared to other Baleaf bras and it's not very comfy. Will not buy another one.
2.0,"So I love the feel of the shirt, but the made to measure bit was way off. This did not fit well at all. It is baggy where regular shirts fit well and tight where it doesn’t need to be. I didn’t expect perfection for 25 bucks and measurements done through pictures, but I did expect it to fit at least as well as off the rack shirts."
2.0,"I ordered larger than I usually take, but it wasn't large enough.  I had to return, and order next size up.  (I'm 5'5&#34;, 165 pounds, and would need an XXL)"
2.0,The material was too thin.  I returned it.
2.0,Really cute style it’s just way too small
2.0,"Ordered a large but the dress didn’t fit right, too small.  Will be returning it."
2.0,Very flimsy made. The bag it came in is very nice
2.0,It came broken and not the color I chose.
2.0,Never managed to use them as they would roll up and down and would not stay in the right place.
2.0,I like the idea of all the colors but the compression was so strong I could not stretch them enough to get them on - and I tried.  They should come in different strengths.  The size of the socks did not seem accurate to me.
2.0,Didnt meet my expectations
2.0,"I was excited about this dress, think the smallest size is small and I needed an extra small."
2.0,Too big but nicely made.
2.0,Great picture and transfer of video super easy. The frame is cheap. I left it in my car over night and it was a little cold that evening (San Diego California cold) I placed them on my head to go to the range and bumped into the door frame and the glasses frame snapped like a twig. The glasses legs are a little thick and block vision slightly.
2.0,Wasn't what Id hoped for. I have a long torso and a big butt  ( a wonderful big butt) but those attributes just make this impossible to fit well for me.
2.0,This product was paper thin. The dress was too think to wear because it was see through
2.0,"I ordered this and when my package arrived, there was only one band inside.  I initiated a return, thinking there had been a mistake during packaging and ordered it a second time.  They just arrived yesterday and still there was only one band.  The quality seems good, but the false advertising needs to be corrected."
2.0,"These earrings are very pretty. That’s about all they have going for them. Being rose gold plated, you wouldn’t think they would turn your skin green.  My ears turned green! 2 of the holes in my ears got infected. I have had rose gold plated earrings and necklaces before and have never had this issue."
2.0,"It got here on time, but I am very unhappy with this. It looks like the gold parts are actually gems, but they aren't. It's a picture pasted on a silicone case. Also, there are no side buffers so there is no protection if your phone drops."
2.0,Constantly needs to be re-adjusted.. Comes loose with wrist/hand movement.  Fits Garmin Venu well. Looks nice.
2.0,"This is NOT a sweatshirt, it is just a very thin hoodie. It’s thin enough that you can see through it. It reminds me of the cheap thin material Halloween costumes are made of. Definitely not what I was expecting."
2.0,"The picture shows some kind of distressed fading in the picture but mine came solid & dark. Not really what I expected, haven't been worn."
2.0,Run very large. Almost too much stretch. See through. Very thin. Warm but not fleece lined. Not lined at all.
2.0,"Very comfortable. But... the ear holes present a slight issue. After your ears are thru, it bunches near your eyes and now you have to fight the Gaiter from getting in your eyes. Plus it bunches out near the ear holes when worn causing it to look bad"
2.0,I wish there was a maxi skirt for short girls. I am 5'3 and this came probably like 2 feet below where my feet are.
2.0,"Despite ordering extra large, found them snug and too short."
2.0,"Wow, what a terrible lanyard. First, it is printed on one side only, the other side is black. Second, it's stretchy. Yep, a stretchy lanyard. Let's just say if you have a good size set of keys, the lanyard will stretch to your belt. Not sure why it's so elastic! I do not recommend. Also thought it came with a breakaway attachment to the neck of the lanyard and it does not. Just one giant elastic rubber band. Already processed the return."
2.0,The arm lenght is off and it os really thin.
2.0,I don’t like the material at all. Thin and a lot of static cling. Looks awful on due to fabric. Fail on my part.
2.0,Beware. Six pack means six socks not six pair.
2.0,"1st time I used them the zipper split, it was NOT over packed, in fact it was under packed. Would not buy this item ever again!"
2.0,Fabric was not as expected
2.0,Nice dress it was true to size however poorly constructed I am two weeks away prom and now my daughter in search of a dress if we were not about to take dress to be pressed I would have never seen it coming apart.  And now i have to wait 48 hours to see if a refund is authorized
2.0,Bathing suit material is very nice and the sequins pineapple is cute buuuut the shape of the suit is very odd. The torso is so short its like its made for and adultvin length but notvin width.
2.0,The watch straps would not hold.
2.0,"Negatives - Dress is very heavy.  The fabric is unusually heavy and therefore the dress kind of sags on the body, doesn't drape nicely.  The pockets create bulk at the hip line which is obviously not desirable and it just hangs from the shoulders.  Was not flattering.<br /><br />Positives - Dress was long enough.  I am 5' 6&#34; and the Large was perfect length to wear with flat sandals.  Color is as represented.<br /><br />Going back."
2.0,Not made very well. They seem uneven and one of the lenses is loose you can feel and hear it move.
2.0,Doesn't last even 25min
2.0,Small fit. Quality of material is thin to be a sweatshirt.
2.0,"Cool looking hat, very small.  too small."
2.0,"My son loved it, but only washed & wore it once before the threads started coming undone on the end on the sleeves & each end of the robe tie. Bummer. :0("
2.0,Looked at this boot twice and thought I would purchase. The size 6 was $80 now a significant price hike.
2.0,it is not Small
2.0,These are comfortable pants. The drawstring is very thin and feels like its gonna break when you tighten them up. If the string breaks their useless.  I ordered 3 pair of them but not thinking their gonna last very long due to the thin cheap string.
2.0,Maybe if this cost $8 I wouldn't care but we won't use this item.
2.0,These shirts are way too snug.  Order a size or two larger
2.0,Functional but thin and cheaply made.
2.0,There is not a bifocal in the pack. ;( I wanted to try bifocals.<br />Don't buy if you are expecting one pair to be bifocals like the question/answer.
2.0,For the price they were very pretty .  I wore them foe the first time and the bottom portion fell off and I lost it.  I can still wear the studs but not what I wanted.  Check the backs for bends and damages.  I am trying to return it and get a new pair because they're pretty but not super functionable obviously
2.0,Cheaply made. Broke within the first week. Screen protector was not tempered glass.
2.0,"No way to remove the watch with the band on, without sliding it off the wrist, band is small, even for a ""women's wrist size"""
2.0,"I ordered these in both gray and black, both XL-30. The gray ones fit perfectly and I love them. The black ones are 2 inches shorter in the legs than the gray and for some reason the tag only says XL and does not have length on them. I unfortunately took the tag off already, so am unable to return."
2.0,"Because of the way it wraps, it “fit” in the waist but then wouldn’t even come close to wrapping around my hips and thighs, so I’m returning."
2.0,"Im a size 0, 5’5 115 pounds and ordered a medium so it would be big on me and its really fitted and hits just below the knee which is not how it’s pictured at all or how it’s described in the recommended sizing."
2.0,"Not sure the suit I received is a real Solid & Stripe swimsuit. The body was short and the “belt” was a band of fabric, think hair turban, with a huge fabric wrapped fake buckle.<br /><br />Does anyone make a simple scoop neck swimsuit that actually fits?"
2.0,"Any weight and the cushioning goes down to nothing, thats not a very effective cushion. The fabric is better at cushioning than the foam in this thing."
2.0,"I like all of the elements of the package, but the little glasses are way too small for my face. They are more child size. Also, one of the nose pads on the glasses came off as I was taking it out of the package. Other than the glasses, all of the other parts are as expected."
2.0,little to cheap look not made well  no collor to them.. but I will make it work
2.0,"The dress is super cute however, the fabric is a weird material. It felt like a waterproof sleeping bag material."
2.0,"The print and colors are vibrant and adorable, but I doubt I'll be using this as an actual apron. The material is thin, and seems to be cut smallish for a unisex size- it  looks and feels as though it would not  wear well or last long for actual cooking use and getting dirty.. I'd be afraid to put it in washing machine. Overall, fun to look at, but not practical for its intended use."
2.0,Material is nice and soft. Runs large. Ordered a medium but it fit like a large. Gave it to my preggers friend and she loved it
2.0,Very loose fitting. I can not use them.
2.0,Pretty cheap made product that was to short
2.0,It was cute. I'm only 5'6 and the pants were at my shins. I gave them to my 5'2 friend and she loved them
2.0,Gained 4 to 5 minutes a day
2.0,"They look good, nice accessories included, but their measurements for what they will fit are not accurate. If your lens are 43 mm in height, these clip ons will not fit; their lens are 43mm but are sitting on top of your frame, which means they don't reach the bottom of your lens. They would need to be another 5-10 mm in height."
2.0,"Ok let me start buy saying that I had boughten an apron by this company a few years back, and LOVED IT. Im a full time groomer who works at 2 shops so I got 2 of these, this one and a purple one. First off the black desige is velvet, hair sticks to it. And after wearing it 4 days a week for about a month the velvet is comming off in places on the silver one. The purple one has pockets , the silver one dose not. The ruffel material isnt the same on both aprons, the purple one collects hair like crazy! The inside of the strap on my purple one is sharp and i find it so irritating on my skin i stopped whereing it last week, (and i only where that one 2 days a week). Im extremely disappointed. I wonder if the desiger knows anything about grooming dogs, because of how much hair gets stuck to these things! I still gave them 2 stars but thats only cuz i think there cute, I would not purchase these again. Its only been a month and now i haft to find a new apron."
2.0,"The dress is defective. The skirt is wrong made. The width of two pleats in the front are not equal and made the front looks asymmetrical. The pleat above the right pocket is wider and more open than the pleat above the left one. The dress looks strange, poorly sued. I returned it and get my refund right away."
2.0,Way too small and so up my butt I had to give it away😑
2.0,These are not what I thought. They are just a typical shirt to wear around the house.  I am fit and these did not fit as i hoped like in the photo.  Is what it is.  I cant bother to returning them
2.0,It's a very nice looking sweater.  I found the sleeves to be tight fitting.
2.0,Cheaply made inside boobs covers fold and get messed up. Can still see your nipples.
2.0,These socks are thin and not at all absorbent.  The only function they will provide is the picture on them.
2.0,The picture is misleading. The fabric is soft but it’s extremely form-fitting. Not a very forgiving look if you’re curvy like me. Ordering one size up didn’t make a difference since it hugs your body anyway. The fabric is also very thin outlining the shape of any bra you wear underneath. Not for self-conscious women.
2.0,order a couple sizes larger and very tight in the legs.
2.0,"I don't like nursing with this as it just lays flat over babies head and you have to hold the cover up constantly to be able to see baby and such , I personally did not like at all or use"
2.0,It was lighter weight than I expected. I sent it back.
2.0,The silver tones are different.  The chain color does not match the charm.  The charm was very pretty but the chain made it look cheap.
2.0,"I mean for six dollars what do you really except. It is what it is. Its smaller than i pictured, bout 4 inches long. And it just looks dirty. Idk, it looks scratched up and like ive had it for years.Its kinda hard to read. I haven't worn it yet but it doesn't look like im gettin alot of uses. I mean again its cheap, it looks cheap and it is cheap. Wouldn't order again."
2.0,This is a cute bag but it has a very strong petroleum smell that I couldn’t get rid of. Not the smell you want with your lunch. Also the Velcro pulled away from the flap fairly soon after we got it. We made it work but I wouldn’t buy this again.
2.0,Not fully leather. Plastic on the inside.
2.0,Sized too small.  I always wear size large but this was more like medium.
2.0,Already scuffed and scratched and haven't used it much yet.
2.0,"I have a lot of hair and a big head :) I have always wanted to be able to wear baseball caps. This was actually quite large and when tightened, seemed to flair out above the ears. I had to return.<br /><br />Loved the color!"
2.0,"I purchased a medium based on the reviews and it was way too big, I returned/exchanged for the Small and it is practically just as big as the Medium.  I'm 5'0 and was 180lbs (pregnant) and it was too big for me."
2.0,Not impressed. Looks cheap. Dull color. Returning.
2.0,"Very poor quality. I can see gaps in the fabric already, and the printed dots are very low quality. I suppose you get what you pay for."
2.0,The seller sent it on time in nice packaging BUT the item itself seems like it's going to break any second. And if the necklace turns it looses it's sparkle because the crystal is one-sided.
2.0,"Daughter was living it. Lights up and comfortable fit. After a month of use, one foot stopped charging. Never again."
2.0,"yeah no. Great service, just as described but look terrible in person. to me anyway."
2.0,"Love the color and style, runs small."
2.0,"The watch is pretty and it fits my tiny wrist on the last hole.  However, I didn't submerge it in water but I had it on while washing my hands and now it has condensation under the crystal. I cant be bothered to take a watch off every time I wash my hands ; I just won't put it back on."
2.0,"Looked flatter and stiffer than  the photo.....Also, cheaper- looking....I'm confused by the good reviews of this....."
2.0,"The neck scarf scarf was very small I had to cut it off because it looked like a scrap of fabric with no purpose. Other than that, the mask is fine, but mor more fashion than function- very thin fabric."
2.0,"My son runs on the larger scale and this was still to big for him. Hat was ehh, outfit was cute!"
2.0,Loved the bracelets as soon as they arrived. As I wore the red one it started to stain my wrist. Eventually it faded in to a pinkish color. And black one broke after a couple of days of use.
2.0,"This color was suppose to be red, but the color is more like a pink red.......  I was disappointed with the color.  If I would have know this would of have been more on the pink side, I wouldn't have ordered this color.  I should have order black........<br />As for the size and compartments, its great!"
2.0,Super thin and run big. I also got two of the same size and they sent me two different sizes. One being a plus size. Wish I would of sent them back tbh..
2.0,"I bought it for sanding my bedroom ceiling as all construction goggles fogs up, no difference here just as bad as any other goggles, worst part is I use de in a very dry day, can’t imagine how bad it is if used for swimming."
2.0,These shoes are cute. However I ordered a size 9 and received size 5. There is no way I can wear a size 5. Unfortunate because they are really cute and I was looking forward to wearing them.
2.0,Disappointed with the way this dress fit. The elastic around the empire waist was tighter than I would have liked and the waist line fell a little lower on my body than I had wanted. It just wasn't  flattering.
2.0,Pattern and coloring was brighter than in the images on the model. Also felt like a frock just sitting on me. It may have just been me but I was not a fan of how this dress looked on. It also was a bit larger than I expected.
2.0,Demasiado sencilla la tela frágil para el precio que tiene
2.0,"Bought it for hunting and it appears to be good quality, the size chart is way off though! I’m usually an xl guy and I’m 5’10” tall and got the 2x just in case but even that is extremely small. Don’t get me wrong it does work great but it’s skin tight and shirt doesn’t reach all the way to my wrists, nor does the leggings quite make it to my ankles... probably just gonna end up giving it to my wife since I’d probably need 5xl based on how it fits."
2.0,Really cute but it felt cheap. Kind of like a necklace from a gumball machine. You get what I pay for I guess
2.0,Not as expected at all. My daughter could have made these. Tried to cancel right after order but they wouldst allow me to.
2.0,That I didn't get the purse with the belt that went with the belt
2.0,Much shorter than shown. It does not even reach the belt line on my jeans. Fabric soft though.<br />Will return for size though
2.0,cheap snap
2.0,Could not do it ...need 4 hands
2.0,These were so cute out of the package but they are so so small and way too long. I got an xl and they wouldn’t even fit past my mid thigh. Don’t at all recommend for the thick girls at all.
2.0,"The belt itself is ok, but it was too large. According to the sizing chart I need a medium, so I ordered a medium and it was too big. To me, a stretchy waist belt should be snug around your natural waist and this belt just falls down. I'm not even sure that a small would fit me properly, so I'm returning and will not be purchasing again."
2.0,PROS: Breathable and Washable material I expected. Lion pattern is beatiful....BUT...<br /><br />CONS: I have a problem with the WHITE stitching. This is not what is displayed on the Amazon site. This White stitching makes the masks look CHEAP and TACKY.<br />Especially when the white stitches are CROOKED and JAGGED and you can tell it was rushed. Some parts the stitching looks unfinished and botched.<br />Dark coloured thread should have been used as in the display to conceal any flaws or imperfections with the stitch job.<br /><br />I will be returning BOTH Masks and hope the seller will adjust the way they complete these masks because I would like to repurchase but only if the stitching MATCHES the masks material/colour.
2.0,"We were so excited for this dress for my daughter. That being said she fits within the size guidelines that was recommended, but the size 12 we received is loose up top and way short on the bottom and doesn’t look like the dress we ordered. My daughter usually wears a 10/12 at Target and other retailers. So I’m wondering if maybe it just is marked the wrong size?? That being said- the dress that we received came fast, the dress is well made, and has the softest material. Just wish it matched the picture and size wise wasn’t so small. The dress pictured shows it goes to the models knee and partially below it. The dress we received fit up top, but the bottom skirt part was super short!  That is the only reason for the lower rating. If it had been the right size, or looked like the picture, it for sure would have received all 5 stars. We will be returning this."
2.0,"Way too small,"
2.0,The idea of hooks you can put on your umbrella is a great one. We hung our towels and bag on it which kept them off the ground and also helped weigh the umbrella down so it did not fly off. Only problem is the whole thing is made of cheap plastic. So being able to turn the plastic screw tight enough into the plastic clamp to hold anything was impossible. After a few turns the screw threading was stripped. So we ended up gluing the piece on. Which worked too. Just can't replace it if any of the hooks break off now.
2.0,"I liked the fit, the color (grey) but I didn't like the material because it wrinkles too much.  I wouldn't buy it again for that reason.  I would prefer blouses that are made with a combination of polyester and cotton that will hardly show any wrinkles."
2.0,"I’ve gotten a dress pretty similar to this before so I was thinking this one would look as flattering as that one did. Oof it did not, i’m a curvy 5’2 girl and it really just didn’t fit anywhere well at all. I did get a L so it wasn’t that i got the wrong size it just wasn’t flattering and the material was pretty thin."
2.0,"These are SO CUTE, but don't buy if you have even medium to large sized womens hands."
2.0,Returned.  To  me it did not warrant the price.
2.0,"I ordered the medium hoops, which are supposed to be 4.0cm. They are much smaller than what I was expecting, and significantly thinner and smaller in diameter than the image of the blonde lady wearing them makes them look. Fine quality and light, but not what I was expecting."
2.0,Looked like a toy. Not impressed. Doesn't hold glasses.
2.0,Size very small
2.0,It's okay. Don't like the sleeves.
2.0,"I'm sorry, I wanted to like these, but they just aren't comfortable. I was looking for something like the Sensi sandals which massage the feet while I walk. These do massage, and the size is fine (they fit), they're cute, but they are not comfortable to walk in or wear.  I was trying to save money, and I ended up buying 3 pairs of shoes, none of which really work, and I'm going to end up buying the Sensi sandals anyway.  I don't know when I'll ever learn, with shoes just to buy the shoes I know will fit unless the return policy is awesome."
2.0,"Bought for a trip, but this might be good for a beach outing.  Probably would have sent back, but to much time passed."
2.0,"I was really excited to order this, but it really disappointed me. It feels like a semi stretchy cheap shower curtain. And it’s BEYOND oversized. I looked so stupid in this."
2.0,"I had to send the first one back because the stitching around the airtag holder was ripped and coming unthreaded before even trying to put the tag in it. The second one has a problem where the money clip gradually works it's way out of the wallet. It's not easily put back in place at all. Kinda puzzling that it slowly walks out, but it does. I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"Was very disappointed in the quality of the shirt. Upon opening the package a small wooden piece came flying out of the package. At first I couldn't tell what it was so I picked it up and set it to the side. As I tried on the shirt, although a large, it fit extremely oversized. It basically fit the equivalence of a XXL sized shirt. At this point I realized what the little wooden piece was; it was a piece of the top button. The buttons seems to be made from a very light compressed wood that seems to be extremely fragile. I am not sure it the button broke during manufacturing or shipping, but the other buttons show that they can easily meet the same faith should you not handle with extreme care.<br /><br />The print was nice at least. Will be returning being that the poor sizing and broken button would not allow me to wear for a special event."
2.0,I have the shorts in this brand which are thick and comfortable with awesome side pockets so I thought I would try the leggings but they don’t seem as thick and you can kinda see your underwear through them if they aren’t same color as your leggings.
2.0,I gave this a two.. I ordered the Blue / White / Beige and I received a Pink / White / Peach. It fits well at least but it is not the color I wanted or ordered. So a two for the qualty and fit..
2.0,They were very nice looking shoes but we're just too tight
2.0,Appeared gold but actually a rose gold
2.0,Good shirt.  Very high around the neck.
2.0,"This item was a disappointment, want to know why? I'll tell you, A simple step not taken to sew/hem the opening for the mouth instead of leaving it as a slit in the fabric. The fabric not hemmed was drawn inward & outward with every breath I took. Great idea with the zipper but this is a fail in my book.<br />Note: If the edges get stitched & hemmed I would not only re-purchase this item, I would highly recommend it to family & friends, it does provide great coverage."
2.0,looks cheaply made and various threads coming undone and some places un sewn
2.0,"Although very cute, the snap button broke off after 1 month of use. I can still use the wallet of course, but I suppose now it’s a flip wallet rather than one that actually closes. Unfortunately, I already have 2 non-buttoning wallets..."
2.0,"I ordered this dress for a Holiday Dinner I was going to. When it arrived it was just as described but the part of the dress that just hangs made me look wider than I really am. Also, the chest area really accentuated my breasts. It looked like I had implants! LOL. Even my friend was like &#34;Wow, where did those come from?!&#34; I decided to not wear it for the party which was a good thing because it turns out I wouldn't been the most dressed up person there. I ended up returning this and received a refund."
2.0,"I loved this watch when I first got it, but the battery drained from high to low in less than 24 hours. Happened every time I charged it to H. I had to return it. Maybe mine was defective. Too bad, because everything else about the watch was great."
2.0,Material not real comfy.
2.0,"No what I had expected, the material feels like bathing suit. Looks and feels cheap. I ordered a small and that was too big on the bust as well as it being too long. Will be sending this back."
2.0,"The cuff is too small and the whole thing is kind of dull. I would have returned it but I accidentally threw out the mailing envelope, too much trouble."
2.0,Loved the bottoms they fit perfectly but the top is way too small. There’s no way this is a large. Maybe it would fit an a or b cup.
2.0,Great colors and sparkle-served it’s purpose as door prizes but cheaply made.
2.0,"These are pretty thin and cheap.  I figured it would be good enough for  a costume, but they were too short."
2.0,Wasn't a huge fan of the navy color. Looks a bit Amish. Other colors look Fantastic!
2.0,"The shorts fit okay, and the material is light and stretchy. They're just not what I expected. I was hoping from looking at the pictures that the shorts would have some shape, but since they sort of droop on you, the gentleman part can be quite revealing. I was looking for something that I wouldn't be too embarrassed to wear especially when we get into those interesting Yoga positions, and I understand that some people may want to show off certain parts, and these shorts will do great for them, but they're just not for me. I'll just use them for private practice at home where the audience is just my wife and a dog."
2.0,"Nice swim suite if you can get the sizing and colors right. After reading reviews of it running small, I ordered an XL the first time (I typically wear a M or L or a 34C top) the XL bottoms fit but the top was way too big. Since it was pretty inexpensive I decided to keep it and just order a M to get the top to fit. Well it was way too small but then I realized the tag said it was actually a size S even though the bag it came in said M. So I ordered a third time because I really like the thing but the medium top did not fit either....I ended up with a L top. BUT the problem now with the large is the yellow is a completely different shade of yellow (not so neon-you can see in pic) and instead of navy blue stripes it is black stripes  so even though I have a bottom (XL) that fits and now a top (L) that fits, it's different colors! I will be sending back unless they can resolve this!"
2.0,"Love the colors they bring out, but these glasses don't fit well on my face and I believe they are actually women's glasses..."
2.0,Shell fell out after two weeks of wearing and wood dried out.
2.0,Comfortable but no support
2.0,Really? RicRack trim on polyester fabric? I had to wear Bell dresses like that as a little girl in the 70s because my mom just learned to use a sewing machine Lol. What next potholder slippers?
2.0,"When I received these they were loose in the box and the circles were distorted. I tried to reshape them because they are very easy to bend, but that's where they go completely wrong.<br />For this price, they should have a much better way of securing them to your ears. They have a very cheap, bendable clasp... If you can even call it a clasp.<br />I got them as secure as possible on my ears, but realized 1/2 way through my work day that 1 was missing. Now the other is completely useless. This is a horrible design. Save your money!"
2.0,"These pants were WAY too small! I ordered a medium but they looked like they were made for a child. I was somehow able to fit into them but I’m surprised they didn’t rip. For context, I’m 5’4 and 125 lbs. Def should have ordered a large or xl. Waste of money."
2.0,This is the first thing that pops up when you type in “Carhartt jacket for men”. I accidentally ordered it thinking it was a carhartt and it also runs big. The Large is massive
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:596f8472e41e369151fe946e3c4a7a47]] My daughter grew out of a size 5 so I ordered a size 6 in these shoes and they were huge. It wasn’t too much of an issues since it’s still to cold out to wear these. But both shoes have blue ink all over them, it’s as if someone took a pen to them and tried to wipe it off."
2.0,"Ordered these for my dad to wear while in a rehab hospital.  He specifically asked for cotton so he wouldn't get so sweaty sitting in the wheelchair. There is no way these are cotton!  They feel like old fashioned thick  polyester. The fiber content label is only in 1 language - Chinese- and it says 95% ??? 5% ??? The only part of these pants that might really have cotton in it is the waist band. The washing instructions say dry low heat and iron low heat.  If they were really cotton you could dry and iron with higher heat. I give them 2 stars because the size seemed accurate and the pockets zip which is great, but I needed COTTON!"
2.0,"The suite is beautiful, but the pants are about 4 sizes too small. The look like they'd fit a tiny 12 year old..  The top fits beautifully."
2.0,Fit tight all over for the size
2.0,"One good thing about this item is that I received it pretty fast. They were in good condition when I took them out the package. When I tried them on, they sit crooked. Maybe its just a factory defect."
2.0,"I really like this wallet. Unfortunately the zipper is not high quality or of good construction. Why put a cheap zipper where a wallet is used the most? I have had it for nearly two months. The zipper end is tucked into the fold, not secured in any way that I could see, and neither was there a bar across the bottom to secure the zipper end when I had to fish it out of the fold. I have fixed it 2x and broke again. The rest of the wallet is fine, but I can not use it if I can not close it."
2.0,"Well, First off, they are not the ""Laser Light"" as advertised.  Laser indicates a narrow beam of light, as apposed to a Flashlight type beam of light.  Secondly, they pack two extra lights of red, white, blue , and green lights in the package in consideration that a couple lights will be non-functional. Out of eighty finger lights I purchased, 40, were suppose to be Laser, but were the same as the Bright Finger lights, fifteen lights were non-functional out of this package of forty-eight. Again after turning them on and off a few times, the lights stop working because of the switch. Most of the lights are working well after repeated on and off trials.  Could be given to children over five that can follow instructions to be careful with the lights....  Hey, it's a chance we take in purchasing.  I'd recommend buying the 40 for $8.00, and just buy an extra 40."
2.0,Earrings are pretty but unfortunately it broke after 2 weeks. I was attempting to take them off and the post broke in my ear. I wouldn’t recommend for long term wear
2.0,"First I will say they are comfy and I don’t mind the fit though if you want a baggie fit I’d say size up. My complaints are small, the undershorts are a bit longer than I thought but can be pulled up to desired length easy enough as long as your phone isn’t weighing down your pocket. My other complaint and the one I’m most disappointed in is that in the back near the band there is a “poof” of fabric that won’t go away no matter how I play with the shorts. I’ve tried pulling the top layer down to smooth it but it won’t stay flat, I’ve also tried pulling the shorts up a bit higher to see if that helped but it didn’t work. While I will keep these, I’ll probably only wear them around the house or with a long top to cover the poof."
2.0,Weird fit. Cute idea. Kinda like a pillow case
2.0,"The image on the actual earrings is not as crisp as is shown in the picture. It's a lot of picture to try to fit on an earring, and it's blurry, so you really can't make out what the image is. That's too bad, because I thought these earrings would make my life complete."
2.0,I returned this purchase as they were way to small.
2.0,"I bought this for my 7 year old son. The clasp doesn't stay closed and is pulled apart easily. The braid is also very thick, so if you are putting numbers on it be aware that it will be tight."
2.0,Wasn't what was expected and picky teen was disappointed in the material. I thought it was cute but what do I know... I'm mom 🤷🏼‍♀️
2.0,"Wore the purple moon for 3 days and noticed the purple was gone. Just, fell off without a trace."
2.0,Cute but more narrow than expected but kept
2.0,"Sizing is completely off with this. I wear size 32 pants so ordered size 34 belt, and it was still about two inches too short. Possibly I got a defective belt but buyer beware. On the plus size, it seems to be decent quality."
2.0,Fastening loops rip off very easy.
2.0,"Could not figure out the strap, otherwise is cute. But no instructions and I think it was defective"
2.0,The brisells are veryyyyy stiff.<br />I expected them to be softer...<br />Earrings are ok.<br />Just very hard.
2.0,Nice style. Pretty fabric. MUCH too long so had to be returned
2.0,Size runs small. Disappointed there isn’t an option to exchange. Paying to return them due to sizing issues only to buy another pair is frustrating.
2.0,Two of these chokers broke and two of them are too big to look good. I have a somewhat skinny neck but it can’t adjust to get any smaller.
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed in these shorts, both by the quality and by the cut. They ride up constantly, exposing most of my backside to the world, but also have a high slit in the sides, which looks awkward. The material is more spandex-y than denim, so while it's more comfortable, it really doesn't work as a ""denim"" short. The fringe is okay, but everything else is a low bar for what I was expecting. I don't think I'd recommend these."
2.0,"Me nice if the top area wasn’t so low because it was too big for the dress to be a small, but cute pattern on the dress"
2.0,Took a very long time to receive.  They are actually more of a light purple color than a blue-purple.  Not at all like the photo color.
2.0,Not what I expected at all. Very poorly made. Ok to wear at home. Wouldn't wear out or to beach as I originally planned to do.
2.0,"I am 5' 6&#34; 130 lbs and got a small. A medium may have been better. It does fit similar to the woman in the picture, except for the neck, which is wider and shorter - more like a cowl neck than a turtleneck. One sleeve is too short for me, and one of them isn't. The drop shoulders hit at different places on each arm, so it looks and feels slightly off. It is poorly knitted and so stretchy that it doesn't hold its shape at all. In my opinion it is not worth $20."
2.0,I can not tell any difference in wearing these and not wearing. It does not help driving a night.
2.0,"Mask is winter thick! Wanted to use for riding bike, but its too hot!"
2.0,Lasted a couple wears each and both were snagged. Noting special about these kids pantyhose. They do make ones out of thin almost snag free at her dance studio that have lasted months and many many wears without snagging.
2.0,Cute but doesn't fit
2.0,I was charged for the shoes even though I returned because they wer too large.
2.0,These shoes were cute enough but they were super wide and much too big. Sizing down wouldn’t have helped because of how wide they were.
2.0,"If you live in a house with stucco siding, aluminum siding, or a steel frame, or one of those blocking the west side of your house, your Casio watch with ""Multi Band 6"" will probably not receive the ""Atomic Clock"" signal -  except, possibly, if you can put it on the sill of west-facing window to recieve the signal and you are not too far from Fort Collins, Colorado.  Amazon, like all the other sellers and Casio itself, do not make this clear- slimy disingenuousness at best.  I have already regaled my husband with this ""feature"" of his birthday gift, and will now have to walk back my glowing report or find anorther gift.  Really stinks, Amazon."
2.0,Literally broke 10 sec after opening
2.0,Fit was too tight for my head.  These glasses pinched my temples... tried to give them to 10 year old granddaughter and she felt they were too tight also.  But I imagine they'd be great if you had a really tiny head.
2.0,"Does not hold much. Cross body purse is nice, the bottom edges was ruined pretty fast. My fault or cheap product??"
2.0,The fit of this is not what I expected
2.0,Are usually wear a size 12 to 14 bought a size large way too tight very clingy material and I happy and I’m trying to return it
2.0,Holes in several pairs
2.0,"I liked the band, it fit well and looked nice. However, I've only had the band 3 months, I don't wear it all the time, and it broke today. No means for return. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone considering."
2.0,"It’s a great fashion statement .  Not so much as a watch . It loses 5 to 10 minutes a day in time . It states its waterproof spotswatch but  you advised not to dive , snorkel or swim with the watch .  So what sport ?  Toilet bowel drop ?  I have had many compliments about the style .  It’s a cheap good looking fashion piece ."
2.0,This third time  I buy this product. The first time was perfect and the material are soft and durable. I bought for the second time and the material was different. I thought I made a mistake in my order so after a year I reordered my first order and the material not as the first one. Fabric is different and harsh
2.0,I usually have fairly good luck with t shirts but this one was a disappointment.  Even thought this shirt fit fairly well....and was comfortable....the thread in the left sleeve came unraveled after the third washing. I expected a bit more durability out of an officially licensed shirt but I'm sure this one was an unusual slip-up and I was the lucky one to end up with it...I much rather would have won a life time supply of Guinness....lol..but go figure.
2.0,Very stretchy so too big however comfy i will keep them for day in the house not for the gym
2.0,"Unfortunately I bought this strap for my husband & his sunglasses hv alittle wider end arm & they don't fit in the strap end points/ sleeve. He should be able to use them on another pair, we'll see."
2.0,"I knew this top would be short but didn't expect it to be only 14"" long. It comes down like 3 inches below my bra. The arms are also really tight. I usually wear a small/medium but ordered a large after reading other reviews. The arms are still tight."
2.0,The crown was flat and when we tried to Make it a circle/crown connect it the tabs broke!<br />The sash is a sash.
2.0,Hat sits to high up on my head
2.0,Keep sliding off my face.
2.0,"First off, this is a comfortable, easy wearing and decent looking band for my Charge 4. Unfortunately<br /> that is about the only things I can say are good with this band. It is terrible for actually staying on. The little velcro like spots don't hold well at all. The plastic end of the band gets caught on everything and pulls off easily. Shirts, pillow cases, blankets, dish towels, water!! Literally everything will make this band pull off. Then it is there dangling. It is really easy to just reattach it, but it really becomes frustrating. So I don't hate this band, but a band should not be this frustrating."
2.0,"The dress fit perfectly from the rib cage down but the breast area was so incredibly small For my 36d chest size.  Adorable dress, wish it fit better !"
2.0,"Product came stained but I didn't have time to return it, as I needed it right away. I got the neon pink color and it's definitely vibrant! I ordered a medium and my bra size is 34B and I found that the medium was a little small for me."
2.0,It fit where it was supposed to.  I found the fabric a bit itchy and it was really not flattering.  I returned it
2.0,I ordered a small (2-4 US) but it was too big for me. Even the shoulder width is wider than most of my small dresses. I gave it to a friend who is a size 8 US and it was perfect for her.
2.0,"The earrings themselves look good, but the clasping mechanism (threaded screw) was a little longer on one side than the other. Not sure if that's intentional?"
2.0,"Magnets are significantly weaker than similar bands from Apple.  If you don't mind having your watch fall off your wrist, then this is the watchband for you."
2.0,"Pretty. But extremely big. It would cost more money to return these earrings, than to just give them away."
2.0,"These did not stick at all. I couldnt even wear them for an hour because it kept coming off. I have bought some similar and had no issues with them which is why i purchased these, total waste."
2.0,the feel of them aren't that great was expecting  a softer feel
2.0,"Barely tinted, was disappointed with them. Otherwise seemed fine. Very large lenses."
2.0,"If you are quite lean and small chested, this is a good shirt. If you are curvy with a C cup or larger and like your tee shirts to be form fitting and clingy, you will also like this. Soft fabric, stretchy but snaps right back, and short short sleeves (especially when rolled up like it is depicted) but long shirt length. So great for tall, thin people and the very slight, petite."
2.0,Not as cute as pictured. Much larger than expected
2.0,Too small and too pointy so had to return
2.0,"The ring is super cool- I love the coloring as well that the ring spins, however, it is annoying that I cannot wear it unless it’s a very cold day. I ordered in a 7.00, ring came in a 6.00. Since ring sizing, unlike clothing sizes, is not subjective to the design and seller, the sizing is incorrect. I would love to have the ring in the correct size."
2.0,OK piece a bit light
2.0,The strap broke after 2 outings with this purse. The threading also began unravelling
2.0,It’s cute but it’s a too big to fit the wrist of a lady. It maybe be better sizing for guys if they have a larger wrist.
2.0,There’s a right pocket but left pocket is sewn together with a hole tiny enough to put one finger in. There’s a pocket on the inside but just can’t access it. Think these may be fake or ones that didn’t pass inspection for the store.
2.0,I saw other reviews similar to mine. I ordered the pink and it's so pale it looks white. I'd try and return to get a new one but I wanted it for my baby shower this weekend.
2.0,Cause they corny as hell
2.0,"Bottoms are fine, top is weird!"
2.0,"I’m 6’ and this sweater was way too short, above waist line.  Poor acrylic quality, likely to shrink smaller in the wash."
2.0,Comfortable product. Does not offer much compression though. And I order the black and nude combo in XL the nude was significantly larger than the black to the point I cant even wear it. The black fit nicely. The tags both say XL yet the nude fits more like a 2 or 3x
2.0,For the price I didn't expect a perfect product but this feels very cheap and light weight. I have purchased other reasonable priced jewelry and this was the first time I was extremely disappointed with the ring
2.0,I love my bracelet but I am really disappointed that it’s missing the black bead that represents a black hole.
2.0,"These, I'm sure, are listed correctly--they're too similar not to be, but the listing says they're 95% Cotton, and they're not. They're unbreathable polyester. Plus the styling details are different.<br /><br />I wish they'd been what they're supposed to be because those looked really nice. These are cheap looking, serviceable gym shorts. I wear small to medium and, going by the size chart, ordered large, which fit fine, but not slim like pictured. I'll never wear them, so it doesn't matter.  Save your $19 if you hate polyester as much as I do."
2.0,Gorilla can pop out. Not pressed in or glued well.
2.0,It’s VERY tight around your neck. Maybe I have a fat neck but I purchased two and I’m literally choking myself half to death. I ordered these because of the Coronavirus but I’ll die from being strangled to death by this tight A ski masks and its SUPPER THIN!!! Like this is for winter or skiing??? You’d freeze with this on.
2.0,The elastic waist band on this product is not sized correctly. The pants themselves would've fit with plenty of space ( tons of extra space!)  but the  waist band was sized extremely small.
2.0,This is not waterproof i got my feet wet
2.0,These are female shorts. I sure do look cute in them but my wife laughs at me.
2.0,to small. I gave it to a child.
2.0,Leather straps have a bad mildew odor..
2.0,Wore out very quickly bought Duluth brand instead. Big upgrade from Hanes but not worth it since they wear out so quickly
2.0,"I'm 5&#34;11, 180lbs and I bought a XL and it still couldn't fit. It was too tight."
2.0,"If you are expecting to look like the model, it's not going to happen!  LOL<br />I bought this thinking that, since it had underwire, that it would be supportive for my DD girls, but I didn't find this to be the case.  Its more of a shelf bra with underwire built into it, and absolutely no padding.  The fabric was cheap and flimsy, and without a hem, so I was worried about fraying.  My nipples could clearly be seen through both the underwire bra and fabric, and that was at room temperature, if that tells you anything.  The back is very low, and kept on flipping over to show the shelf bra part in the short time that I had it on in my house.  It's not practical if you are planning to be at all active in it.  Also, their sizing chart tells you to order a size up from your normal to start, but I wouldn't suggest it!  I'm normally a size 14, so I ordered a 16, and it was big on me, so stick to your size.  I'm sending this back tomorrow because it's really not worth the amount you pay for it!  I have better tankini's from cheap department stores.<br />I did like the draped feeling in the front though.  If not for the material being so flimsy, I think it could've hid back fat and tummy bulge.  Alas, it shows every roll and dimple.  Sorry, ladies, I'm nothing if not honest!"
2.0,"The bracelet is pretty and inexpensive, so it's the perfect purchase for a dressy accessory; however, the clasp is very weak. I wore the bracelet for a wedding, and if fell off three times. I made sure the clasp was securely fastened, but it kept falling off."
2.0,"Had to return the skirt. Uneven hemline, seam sides of  skirt hem are longer. Would have been a good skirt if it wasn’t for this."
2.0,The dress looks cute but the material is horrible like most cheap dresses on Amazon. The top part of it was all wonky and too big. Would have been pretty good if it was made from 100 percent cotton
2.0,"It was the perfect jacket, light weight and also warm, but the little flap that snaps over the top of the sharp zipper broke 10 minutes after getting the jacket. Such a bummer! We didn't even wear it once."
2.0,The shirt was way shorter than what was depicted in the photo and I barely have a torso.
2.0,"I'd like it if it were actually the YELLOW I ordered.  Actual description was neon yellow--good, what I wanted.  I opened the package, it was neon green--though the tag said neon yellow.  So, someone who is color-challenged is labeling these camis.  I also ordered a navy blue one, it's fine, it's actually navy blue.  But the other one is a very bright spring GREEN."
2.0,Keeps pulling back and ends up under my foot.. fits perfectly but doesnt stay in place
2.0,Unable to zipper up all the way
2.0,"Ordered this costume for my boyfriend, he normally wears a large in everything. The sleeves were very short and the whole costume was tight. I ended up having to return."
2.0,"Based on the reviews I decided to take a chance. I ordered the white shirt and was very disappointed. I'm 5'7&#34; and normally wear a medium/large shirt. I ordered a large and it was a bit short, Very cheaply made, very sheer and the fit was baggy - especially the sleeves. The fit was just strange. I will be returning."
2.0,cute to wear until I washed it!  shrunk up!
2.0,"It's very pretty, but the rose is yellow not cream and it's very cheap plastic and you can see where it's hot-glued onto the back."
2.0,Loved the look and they fit fine width and length but the arch was too prominent so had to return as it was causing me pain.
2.0,Turned a weird color and I had to throw it away after a week vacation in the Caribbean. It did last me the whole week so if you’re looking for a cheap product to get you through a vacation than this is it
2.0,"I returned, won't keep my feet warm. Kind of on the cheap side."
2.0,"Based on the overall star rating and cost, I purchased this kit as a gift. Not long after, it shipped. When I got the notification it had shipped, I decided to look at the reviews (something I almost always do BEFORE buying). I found that the reviews were pretty bad and it was too late to cancel, so I spent at least as much or more buying shoe shine products to augment this one including Huberd's Shoe Grease and several Kiwi polish products. The quality of this thing is pretty cheap and actually looks even cheaper in person. With a little bit of creativity, you can make a better kit yourself for about the same price or a bit more, but be proud of it and not cut a corner."
2.0,Nice idea but too small and tight. Also concern that frayed areas won't hold up.
2.0,The strips cannot be shortened enough. Lacy very scratchy.
2.0,"I was waiting for this item 5 weeks and after I got it I found out that fabric is more like polyester not cotton. It didn't keep me warm when I was wearing it, it was little tight to the body and the fabric was also thin. Seller refunded the entire order along with shipping since it would probably cost me a lot to ship it to China."
2.0,"Size smaller,  you need to go larger"
2.0,"They broke the second time I wore them...I liked them did not fog at all. Nose piece to big, kept slicing down..I’d many be try them again"
2.0,"It was far too large, looked like pajama wear. The material was nice and it was made well, just sizing was poor. I usually wear a large and order the 12-14 size thinking that asian sizing it might be too small. Overly large and far too long."
2.0,"There is nothing wrong with this key chain, I gave it 2 stars as it is much larger than it looks making it look stupid on my belt loop, but if big is your thing it would be great. I have to say something good I guess, so, it's well made"
2.0,It was way smaller than the size listed.
2.0,"So, I have had this bag for about a month now and all seemed well, but now the zipper has been acting up. It still zips, but after many many tries. This is only happening with the outside zipper."
2.0,Too big and just don't like the fit
2.0,"These pants are not a cotton/linen blend.  They are 65% cotton and 35% polyester.  This means they are warmer, heavier, scratchier and wrinkle more easily than cotton/linen.<br /><br />I'm 5'4"" and if they were any longer they would be too long.  The bottom of the left pocket isn't even stitched closed.<br /><br />I haven't washed them yet, but I don't have great confidence that they will survive even a hand wash well."
2.0,The shirt quality was nice unfortunately the sizes were way off :(
2.0,"The medium sweatshirt is not a typical medium-it's totally oversized and fits like a large, plus the sleeves are too big/bulky."
2.0,I didn’t like how less than a month the color started to chip off.
2.0,It wasn't anything like stated in description. Small and super tight
2.0,I thought this would be more tight on the body. At first fits tight then get loses just like a regular tank top
2.0,The zipper comes apart on the bottom.
2.0,"Cute necklace (used as part of costume), but chain broke after wearing it once."
2.0,Cute style but runs very small and shrinks
2.0,Runs way too large!
2.0,"After 2 months of using it, the battery died immediately. Mom was happy with the watch. The life longevity of the battery is just dissapointing."
2.0,slides over your eyes! May work if your head is bigger
2.0,"This dress had. Hidden maternity description in the sub title.  Although, I don't mind- most pregnant people would not have any room for a belly in this dress. I ordered a size up, and this was not enough. The dress fit like a sausage caseing and was down to my shins. This dress would be great for a barbie! The color? Fantastic!"
2.0,"It's not true to size, too small. Up a size if buy."
2.0,Glasses worked fine for about 4 months. Then one day the arm snapped off while taking them off.
2.0,Very cheap material and cheaply made
2.0,Cute dress.  The fabric isn’t the best.  Feels more like a cotton blend and not the poly/rayon/spandex blend that works so well for office dresses.  It doesn’t keep its shape and was fairly stretched out by the end of a work day.
2.0,This item was way too big and too long for me and I ordered based on the size chart. I started the return process only to find that the next size down is not available. Now i have to figure out a way to wear it and not look like a giant floral bag😣. It does look beautiful and has pockets so those are pluses.
2.0,They fall off my head
2.0,"I liked the slouchy fit and asymmetric pattern of this sweater. However, one sleeve was shorter than the other and I felt it right away, tried rearranging the position of the shoulders but it was clear that they just were different. To make sure I was not crazy, I laid it flat and measured the center line of each sleeve. It was a difference of almost 1 inch. This may not sound like a lot, but it was enough to notice by looking at it, and more importantly the sensation of one slightly-shorter sleeve was going to drive me insane. I realize my photo doesn't show this problem because one arm is up, but gives an idea of what the sweater looked like (this is size medium; I am 5'8"", US women's size 6/8 or small/med). I exchanged it, figuring it was a fluke. The 2nd sweater had the exact same problem, one sleeve almost 1 inch shorter than the other. The strangest part is that it was the opposite sleeve from the 1st one. I think 2 stars is fair, the stripes on the back lined up nicely and the colors are fun, but I'm never going to wear it and don't like it enough to try a 3rd one. If the sleeves were not a problem, I would have rated 3-4 stars because it wasn't exactly an awesome sweater otherwise; the drop-shoulder seams were chunky and stuck out weird, thought they might flatten and relax with wear but I'll never know. Asymmetric pattern is great, asymmetric sleeve lengths not so much. I do love the prints though..."
2.0,Bought for my mom .the glasses aren’t Betty boop only the case is.they fit poorly would be better for a kid
2.0,"After the first wash (following washing instructions) and prior to first wear, the elastic that makes these pants stretchy was already breaking and showing at the seams on the legs. This has not happened on other pants I have purchased from this seller until maybe a year into washing and wearing with use of probably once per week. I don't suspect these will last long and are not worth the money."
2.0,These were very cheaply made and it showed immediately. The second I pulled them out of the bag they had a snag that went down the entire leg and they were see-through. Returned them instantly.
2.0,"Ordered 2 different hoodies, 2 different sizes, neither one was as pictured. The tye dye was beautiful, but, the length was way shorter then shown. Not sure if anyone else had this problem, want to keep, but, too short, going back!!"
2.0,"Purchased these hoping they would help, as in the medical profession I am on my feet at least 12 hours a day! These do not stay up and seem to cause more swelling than relief."
2.0,"There is a hidden elastic band in the waist to hold up shorts, rather than the elasticity of the material itself."
2.0,Just as hard to put on as any other compression sock they just teach you how to do it.
2.0,Returned this item because the size runs small and and the pants and not good quality
2.0,"See through, chiffon, poor quality"
2.0,Slim fit. Not for normal feet
2.0,"When I bought this for the first time, the middle finger of this was a little ripped. So I exchanged it but now thumb finger was ripped…"
2.0,It comes down over my ears.
2.0,TOO SMALL SIZE 2INCHES OFF
2.0,Material is very stiff and uncomfiortable -another waste of money!
2.0,The dress runs way smaller than size states. It’s very pretty but very small
2.0,"Cute, but too small across my bust. Returned:("
2.0,"These shorts were great. Until I washed them, then started to wear them again. I bought 3 pairs, and each one keeps ripping at the seams. I now have holes all over them. Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,I dislike the quality and fit of this dress bcuz it fits like a high school cheerleaders dress not long as it appears on the picture. It looks hand sewed and starting to come apart. I will be requesting a refund. I really needed it for a Christmas party next week.
2.0,"they look like the pic- from one side, the other is flat. So they are basically unwearable. Also the wire through them is cut rough and sharp- not exactly what you want to put in your piercing holes. I plan to return them"
2.0,Loose by my stomach have to tie another knot for it to look normal.
2.0,Came tangled up
2.0,Returned beecause fit a little small.  Nice quality material.
2.0,Too narrow and too tight in length. I returned them.
2.0,"Love the shirt it could have been a size bigger , even better if it was a women's instead of junior."
2.0,"1 wash all graffics peeled off , the sweartshirt itself excellent qaulity.."
2.0,"Rubber part (loop that holds on the glasses) broke after a month of use. Otherwise, I would have loved it."
2.0,"Oh, boy. This might be the ugliest shirt I’ve ever bought online.  The sides of the shirt are sewn inside out, as well as the bottom hem.  The sizing is like whoa.  I ordered an XL and it’s more like a triple XL on me.  I can’t wear it and definitely don’t want to.  I’ll take it to Goodwill and let someone else be horrified."
2.0,"Soft material but definitely NOT long, full and flowing as illustrated in pictures-disappointed!"
2.0,"Very cheap bells, fell apart the next day"
2.0,I normally wear a large - I am swimming in the medium it’s just ridiculously huge.
2.0,Fit was great! But.... it’s completely see through on the bottom! I’m so sad I just started working out again and was hoping this would be my new work outfit ! Side note I ordered an xxl and I’m usually an 18-20
2.0,never wore it out too large and ill fitting on me looked sloppy
2.0,The schooler is to small to fit around my neck and my daughter has a skinny neck and it won't fit around here's either. But its okay I'll just try and use it for a bracelet if I can. Next time make it a litter bigger with a long extender.
2.0,The material is not what we expected and the size was too small for a 12.
2.0,Zipper broke and pockets ripped on the fist wear<br />I know have to buy a new one for nest week. Looks great but not
2.0,"I like the shirt and it's flowy and seems true to size.  The shirt portion feels fine but the sleeves, the moment I put it over my head to try it on my shoulders and arms started itching.  Think of material that has tinsel in it, that's what it felt like.  I had to take it off immediately and am sitting at my computer to print the return label.  Bummer because I really wanted a Christmas shirt :("
2.0,Material is uncomfortable
2.0,These are only colored on one side. The other is white. They don’t hang the right direction in my ears either so they show the white side a lot or the time. Disappointed with these because they’d be so cute otherwise.
2.0,These are so hard to walk in and and they are more like stockings with no real support. Cute design though
2.0,Great bag overall but I decided to return it the day it arrived. Construction appears to be fairly sturdy and the material is heavy duty. The only downside is the bag was way too small for me to carry many of my supplies.
2.0,El producto esta bien logrado pero el olor de la máscara es muy fuerte y sólo solo se puede soportar unos minutos puesta
2.0,Did Not state it was coming from China and took about 4 weeks. Never again.Ordered my usual size Medium and it fit perfect and very comfortable.
2.0,These shoes could've definitely gotten more stars if it hadn't been for one of the shoes having a worn strap. I'm completely disappointed that they were shipped to me this way. You can clearly see that the leather strap is worn. Please beware when purchasing these. Not a satisfied customer.
2.0,Cute but it fits a lot smaller then expected and I used the sizing chart! It’s cute but thin. Worth about half of what I paid.
2.0,"Ordered 2 long sleeve and 2 short sleeve all the same size. Long sleeve fit perfectly, short sleeve can't even button."
2.0,I thought the product was very cheaply made...the plastic was very thin and the key ring and clasp were very flimsy.
2.0,Our puppy managed to start pulling it apart in a matter of half an hour of play... 😅
2.0,I ordered this ring for my mom's birthday as I had one myself and she loved it. Well it came smashed so I am returning hopefully next one won't be destroyed. the band is very thin on this ring.
2.0,The backpiece falls off
2.0,Very pale color
2.0,"I bought this dress for my engagement photos and hoped that a small would fit me (I'm a size 0, 5 ft. 7 in.). But it was too big in the bust, and much longer than shown in the picture. Fabric was cheap as well."
2.0,This is cheaply made shirt that almost fit my teenage daughter who wears an adult small.  I ordered an xlarge. Will not buy again!
2.0,These tops are comfortable but after one day of wearing them they fall apart. The trim came unsewn around the arm in less then 24 hours.
2.0,"They were a bit snug, but I managed to get them on. I only had them on for a little while before I went to eat some food. I had gotten a little hot in the mean time and they were nearly impossible to get off. I also would have preferred them to go past my elbow (I have short arms), but they were right at it. These might work better for someone with thin arms, but don't get too warm with them on."
2.0,"The fit and feel of the product are great.  I read the reviews and ordered a size up.  However, the make of the product is poor.  Upon opening the package I noticed a hole in one of the sleeves and several hems were loose.  Just not worth sending it back."
2.0,"i ordered the khaki. this feel super low quality and flimsy, i also found it odd fitting on me."
2.0,"These are cute and soft, but ours broke immediately when my son tried to put them on."
2.0,"I wish I had gotten one of these with more power. I remember reading reviews when I bought, with people pointing out that it might not be 30x like it claims. I have no way to verify that, but I can say that I wish it had more power. If this is 30x, then 60x would probably do the trick.<br /><br />Side note: if you're looking into diamonds like I was (perhaps for an engagement ring) I recommend checking out the knowledge tab at pricescope dot com, and posting in their forums with any questions. Then look into buying from dedicated cutters via mail order with GIA or AGS reports. You'll save money and get higher quality that way. Don't skimp on the research, fellas!"
2.0,"Item is described as being decorated by &#34;top quality leather&#34;.  What is more accurate is that it has PU Leather, which IS NOT leather at all. PU Leather is a synthetic MAN MADE material. Pleather is more accurate. I will be returning these."
2.0,The ball on the end of the stud is nonexistent...the studs slip right out of your nose. Luckily they send a lot of studs for a low price...<br />The assorted color studs are mostly pink...not much variety.
2.0,"Cute boots, but absolutelty nothing &#34;leather&#34; about these. They're vinyl and rubber.  I suppose the fyr is real, no sure.  In fact, they're so cheap, they didn't even sew  the labels on correctly."
2.0,"The glasses is ok, it broke within one week. Not for people work large necks lol, if you’re super small then it’s ok."
2.0,That globe disconnected almost immediately and whatever was holding it on had snapped. Pity. Super pretty
2.0,Tie dye was cute and just as pictured. The problem was the fit. It looks like the sleeves are sewed weird...whenever I picked up my arms it caused the whole shirt to lift and bunch up around the chest. Really sad that the fit was so bad because I absolutely loved the color.
2.0,Served it's purpose but hurt behind my 5 year old's ears
2.0,Pants are super wide but didn't return it because I used it as a gift in a last minute order.
2.0,"5'10"" ordered a medium. Very heavy material so drags very low. Good quality material, just looked more matronly than I was expecting so returning."
2.0,Very small and hard to breathe through. Loops waaay too small.
2.0,Too heavy and large!
2.0,I has a zipper I thought I was getting a pull over but I like what it says so I kept it ugh. It's small I got it for my 6month old son
2.0,"Really cute dress, I was so disappointed I had to return.  It fit pretty much as expected, with one major flaw...  Those cutouts!  It made the dress way shorter, and made it an inappropriate length.  You could literally see my underwear through the cutouts in the back.  For reference, I'm almost 5'8&#34; and normally wear a size 8, I ordered this in a medium."
2.0,Completely see through. I really was looking forward to this top but it was way too sheer to be decent
2.0,"Gift to a friend.  Dislike the fact that the head wrap was sent to me with unstitched holes.  Other than that, my friend likes the towel body wrap."
2.0,Our grandchild loved them for 2 months.Until half of the lights stop working on one of the shoes.
2.0,Thought these would be great for my wedding day but they fell right off with the first step I took.  My heels were a pretty standard size so not quite sure what happened here but unfortunately for me a total waste.
2.0,"Fits weird, too small waist to big butt"
2.0,"The pictures are very deceiving. They run small so if your going to order I would go 2 up (honestly)  the material and the whole top itself is disappointing. And on top of it  it fits and is awkward..not just because I wished I had ordered a larger, much larger size but because it's just plan awkward. Ladies if you have a large bust, you may want to rethink this buy, and if you do order make sure you have a nice tank top for underneath.<br />I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,The bracelet piece turned brown. The necklace is doing fine
2.0,"I only put two stars for one reason - the listed size is wrong.  I would have selected 3 if it was the right size.  Listed size is Size: 7”H x 4.25&#34;W x 2.75&#34;D.  Actual size is closer to 5.5&#34;H x 3.75&#34;W x 1.75&#34;D.  The product description says &#34;XL version&#34;, but the title says &#34;Large&#34;, so perhaps they attached the wrong description to the item.  It is definitely not large enough to fit all phones.  The phone section is about 4.5&#34;H and 2.5&#34;W."
2.0,Very pretty however there is a cross bar in the inside that makes it difficult to fill.
2.0,Very disappointed in the color. It is no where near the color you see in the picture. I received hot neon blue color.<br />I really wanted in navy blue like the picture and that the only reason for 2 stars bc I will have to return it since I didn’t like the color.<br />Wallet is nice and small like I had hoped for.
2.0,These were super cute but they broke very soon after receiving them. They would work great if you never used them or put them on keys or had them on your keys...
2.0,These are dark but the polarized effect is not so evident.
2.0,"This mask is nearly unusable. It constantly slips down below your nose and tightening the straps doesn't help. It doesn't fit closely to your face and has large leaks at the top. So, yes, your glasses will fog up.<br /><br />The 'nose clip' is not metal and does not retain its shape. Therefore it is useless/non-functional. I'm not sure why it's even there.<br /><br />When wearing it, you have to frequently pull it up, violating one of the rules of mask wearing: do not touch the front of it, as there can be viral particles on the surface.<br /><br />I'm sorry I bought these. The masks I got free from my health insurance company are a lot better."
2.0,Socks are too tiny they should be marked girls not women’s! I gave it to stores because they’re beautiful for a little girl but not for women.
2.0,Does not fit the description or picture above. All smashed into little bag and most of the clips came off. You get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,"I love these sunglasses!  They fit nicely and are good quality.  Very pleased with my purchase!<br />***Updated review:  After only two weeks of wearing, the left earpiece fell off and broke while I was walking.  Sending back for a refund.  :(<br />*****Another update~I sent these in for a refund since they fell apart on first use.  I paid $17.99 for the glasses and only got a partial refund.  Save your money for better quality glasses."
2.0,"These pants , although washed in cold water and air dried, seem to be shrinking.  The friend who also ordered the same pair said the same thing."
2.0,it shrunk in the drier
2.0,I bought the set for my sister but she said it's a very bad quality product.<br />Disappointed.
2.0,Super small :/
2.0,Fits small. Not very comfy material
2.0,3 out of 10
2.0,"These glasses were much smaller than advertised. Barely covered half of my prescription glasses. I am guessing several of these reviews are possibly friends of the seller. I am giving two stars because other than size these were a quality item, would be pretty good sunglasses if you have tiny eyeglasses. Seller contacted me twice prior to finding out my opinion, but offered no assistance once found out I was returning they ignored me."
2.0,I purchased 2 dresses feom this seller.  The black floral dress was perfect.  Length was just above the knee and fit just as expected elsewhere.  I would give this dress 5 stars.<br /><br />The red paisley dress was however a different cheaper fabric.  The stitching looked like a 3 year old sewed the dress.  The cut of the paisley dress around the arms and chest was too large and gaped horribly and the dress was much shorter.  I would give this dress zero stars.
2.0,"Supposed to be steampunk, whatever that abused and misused label meant to them.<br />Instead they are regular, round sunglasses with 2 bare, stiff, sharp, cheap metal triangles attached.<br />Klaus Nomi originated the look much better in the 80s.<br /><br />If you're a 20-year-old, EDM club queen you might like them. That's the acquaintance I gave these too, and he did."
2.0,I love the look of this apron and it is lightweight (doesn’t hurt my neck) and fits a plus size body well BUT I’m barely 2 weeks into using it and the pocket edges are ripped already. I barely use the pockets and when I do it’s only for my phone. Also I wish it was more waterproof. I’m just disappointed for the price.
2.0,"Update: I've recently become more and more disappointed with this wallet. The band around the wallet has stayed sturdy but the structural integrity of the body has diminished. The body of the wallet looks on the outside to be in decent shape but it has gotten week causing the cards to come out easy. I'm changing my rating from 4 stars to 2.<br /><br />I've had this wallet for about 3 weeks and I'm so glad I went with this. I was hesitant to buy a wallet like this because the reviews and description say the most cards it can hold. I was concerned about the minimum cards it can hold without sliding out since I have only 3 or 4. With 4 cards it holds very secure. With 3 cards they start coming out and depending on how determined I am to shake the cards out, can fall out (This could be because the elastic band has adjusted to 4 cards since when I first got it, 2 cards held securely. Maybe it will adjust over time when I go to 3 cards again). I keep it in my back pocket at all times and the structural integrity has held up well along with the stitching. I barely if at all feel this wallet in my pocket and have to double check to make sure I actually have it. I bought the rustic brown and the color is pretty much spot on to the picture, maybe a tiny bit darker. The only things I docked a star off is the front pocket for the money is very snug, almost to snug to make putting money in it worth while so I don't use it and secondly it does get marked up pretty easily especially underneath the elastic band."
2.0,"The neck hole is normal sized so no way to get the ""off the shoulder"" look. The sleeves are cut in a way it's more of a batwing type of feel which I like. I usually wear medium and it fits loose. Order up if you want a more baggy look. Also is not sweatshirt material. Overall it's just a loose, long sleeve the dye shirt. I still like it and wear it but nothing like the picture. Colors are correct though."
2.0,"The title description for this bag included the vital word &#34;LEATHER&#34; and I bought the bag based on that description.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the small print which stated that it was &#34;PU Leather,&#34; a term that didn't mean anything to me until I looked it up and found that it was a man made product NOT leather.  If it isn't truly leather the vendor should not be able to use that word in its description unless it uses the additional descriptor of PU.  PU indeed -- this product really stinks!"
2.0,I won't buy this one again because it sagged on me after it got wet.
2.0,The sweatshirt was very stiff with no stretch to it.
2.0,Ordered a medium... It's more realistically a small... My husband is not a big person and in every other shirt/sweater he wears a medium so after ordering this in medium and it being too small we were definitely disappointed. Now he is stuck with a sweatshirt that is too small.
2.0,"Small but quite beautiful with good finish, came with the original package. Seems durable and of very high quality. everybody has given me compliments on this passcase.<br /><br />downside? I got lucky, the one I got has the black edges of the wallet broken, like if it had fallen apart.<br /><br />paying 80 dollars for a really simple wallet with this kind of quality issues? NO. If I had gotten mine in perfect condition I'd have recommended it but I can not recommend something this expensive with this kind of quality issues. even my 20-30 dollars wallet from Tommy, Fossil were packaged more carefully and delivered to me in perfect condition, not broken like this one at 1/3 the price."
2.0,"I gave it away, it was too small"
2.0,vino sin la cartera
2.0,"This is a really cute nightgown but the fit is like 2 sizes too small. I ordered a medium, it fit like an extra small. I usually wear small or medium."
2.0,It looked cheap and not at all pretty.
2.0,"I got 2 shirts normal size, green one is lengthy and after 3-4 wash fabric is getting worse with stitching getting worse for the green one"
2.0,Laces are extremely thin.
2.0,I like the size. The edges are rough and show seams. The glass does not fit properly as it has round corners. The tray has deep puncture marks to make it not easy to put designs on. Price is not comparable to product.
2.0,"It is a lovely necklace but it is too light-colored and  shiney for me so I returned it. If you like that, it is a great necklace."
2.0,"This product was definitely not as sturdy as is should have been. The first time I put it on and reached into the pocket, the seam ripped a couple inches. The price was reasonable, but it's always a disappointment when something fails that quickly."
2.0,Makes my breast look bigger. Barely holds breast without straps. Wears 38d- 40d. I hope someone has better luck. Removing pads doesn't make much difference.
2.0,This shirt looks cuter in the picture. I’m usually an xl. I ordered a xxl and it was tight. It was was very thin. I returned because it wasn’t oversized nor very soft.
2.0,"It's a beautiful design and soft, flowy fabric. However, the material is sheer so be warned. The shoulders are too tight. When I compare this to other shirts of similar style, the back seems to be too small on the top, so it lays awkwardly most of the time."
2.0,Had to put fit as expected. However it fits weirdly. Cheap and I'll made.
2.0,To big... better on a man's face ... disappointed...
2.0,"Way too small, I always order XL, this item was like medium size"
2.0,"This glove had potential to be a good glove, but it falls short in a number of areas.  First of all, like many other brands, they put the battery compartment on the underside wrist area of the gauntlet.  This has never been as good as on the back side of gauntlet, like the discontinued Cabela's (Gerbing) brand, that does not restrict movement as much, and is more comfortable.  Second, the large switch is too easy to inadvertently bump and change the setting, and the bright glow is very distracting.  Again, the switch near the back of the gauntlet like the old Cabela's brand is the best place in my opinion.  Thirdly, these gloves take too long to heat up and they do not get very warm even on the highest setting.  The thumbs do not heat up either.  The only reason I did not give it one star is because they fit well and are very comfortable.  Too bad they didn't get the other areas right."
2.0,"The dress runs very small, size up."
2.0,This dress personally didn’t work for me. It did fit true to size but the material is a bit shinier than it looks like in the picture.
2.0,Great texture but only one rock I received is round enough to work my project on. Very disappointed!
2.0,This was very difficult to wrap and the instructions weren’t clear. I had to look at the video multiple times and it rolls with any activity
2.0,"What appealed to me, most, in the Amazon Ad for this rain slicker, was that it had the large letters: RAIN WALK on the back. This made it super cool stylish, a little Mysterioso,  and just different enough from other similar rainwear.  Imagine my disappointment and surprise when it took MONTHS to arrive and when it arrived, it was not as pictured. There was some plain white logo that made the whole thing look like a freebie from a commercial convention. Ugh. Thumbs down. Sell what you advertise, please, or give a warning."
2.0,"I loved the look of the earring, but It wasn't Staniless Steel as mentioned in the ad."
2.0,"The dresses were so cute and the patterns and colors were bright and cheery, but the XL fit like a small, could not even get my head and shoulders through. Very disappointed as they were going to be my go to dresses when I go to Florida in April. The return however was painless."
2.0,"Size selection was available but no size chart so I made the guess to order a MEDIUM, I supposed a small was for a child. I was wrong.<br />The other thing that was slightly a nuisance is that the placement of the filter entry makes it difficult to insert filter.<br /><br />Please add a size chart to the description."
2.0,"I purchased these for Father’s Day. I thought it would be a cute photo opportunity. Unfortunately, these were too tight and the fabric is not breathable.  It was a struggle to get the child’s mask over my 4 year old’s head and she refused to keep it on long enough for me to even take a picture.  My husband thought it was a cute idea but admitted he would probably never wear this mask because it was too uncomfortable."
2.0,"The sizes listed are way to small, mine I couldn't sip it up at all"
2.0,"Not at all the way it’s advertised.  It fit me like a spandex workout tank top. For the price, it’s cool because that’s what I plan to use it for."
2.0,"The sizing is so wrong on here a 2x has never been a 10-12 and I don’t know why it’s sized like that, was hugley disappointing in this cause it was super cute"
2.0,The Joker one which is the one I wanted is very snugged and not as flexible. I own a few of different ones and this one is by far smaller and uncomfortable.
2.0,"I changed out the cups to the bigger and more shaped ones, almost like a triangle but with a rounded top. It worked much better after I did that. The cups it comes with are small and circular and slide around everywhere so it makes your breast look misshaped. Change the cups and it works much better! I would give 5 stars if it came with decent cups instead of those tiny circle ones. Main problem I have is that the top is spaced too wide so you pop out a lot if you're actually swimming and moving around. If you just want to use this suit to tan in it's great. But anything more and you will be showing your boobs to everyone."
2.0,"Fits well and i like the size of the stones, but I have worn about 5 and all of the stones fell out. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Overall, I’m pretty disappointed in this item. I bought it for my girlfriend and didn’t realize that the back was hollow until after I gave it to her. I thought it would be solid. Now, I’m a little embarrassed for giving it to her. The front looks pretty, but it isn’t worth the money."
2.0,"I ordered about 9 pairs of these Lush Moda leggings, and every single pair was waaayy too big. They claim to fit XS-XL, but that is not the case. I am 5'4&#34; and 105 lbs. Totally bummed about this because I love the patterns & they are super soft. :-("
2.0,"The sizing is very very small, and I don't even have very large fingers."
2.0,The hat was too small for a humans head way to tight! Worn only one time. Argh 😤
2.0,Cute. I ordered 4. They all broke within a week
2.0,Weird scuba material
2.0,"They are NOT 18G. At least 20-22G, lucky it was for my lobes so my lobes are stretchy. If use for helix/conch, THEY WILL NOT FIT"
2.0,Very disappointed as I ordered a GREEN swimsuit and this was not the color shown. A waste of money as I gave it away. 😒
2.0,"Shirt is cute!! I would have loved to keep it, but it fit very snug and I was too uncomfortable. Definitely not loose fitting like the picture unless you size up a couple of sizes. I returned this item."
2.0,Rather cheap looking; like polyester from the 70s
2.0,I’m 5’9” 210 lbs I usually wear L and the top fit very cute. The exceptions are that it’s listed as white and it’s more like ivory. And the wire doesn’t cover the wire track 100% which is weird. If you have a long torso like me it’s a little short for my liking. I will be returning but the style is cute and good stretch.
2.0,"Very soft but extremely thin, when stretched you can see through it. The material reminds me of panty hose/stockings. It is also smaller than expected, fits my 4 year old perfect, so would not recommend for bigger children."
2.0,These gloves did not hold up at all. The leather is very inconsistent and wore through quickly. The stitching also failed in spots. Would not recommend or repurchase.
2.0,Elastic top is like a large thick rubber band. Not going to return it I might have it fixed
2.0,Should have paid attention to reviews. No cuff links and stds mismatched. Hope can get replaced before Christmas
2.0,Molds can be seen clearly with grill in
2.0,Swimsuit runs small. Il keep it to hopefully fit someday. It's nice material.
2.0,Seams came apart in 2 of the bags.
2.0,I loved these at first but they’re already falling apart at the seams. Not even worth the hassle or cost of returning them.
2.0,"Thought ut would be bigger in size. This keychain is very cute and stainless steel but it was just on the smaller side. For the 14 something bucks you pay for it, you'd think it would be a little bigger in size.  Cute but tiny.<br />The receiver did enjoy this keychain overall but it's barely noticeable on his keychain with all his other keys."
2.0,"Fits oddly (but can manipulate to look OK), left a rash on forehead, and I paid $10 more than it's listed for now... so I obviously got ripped off.  Tried to return, but was just over 30 days so seller did not allow.  Don't waste your money on this."
2.0,The picture is not what you get… looks cheap wouldn’t recommend them
2.0,Is not as shown looks cheap
2.0,"Runs VERY small. I'm not busty at a size 34B. The size S/M is SUPER tight on me. It's so tight it's hard to breathe in. The quality seems fine, but the sizing is just ridiculous."
2.0,"I ordered medium and the shirt was way too short. I'm 5'8"" and weight 170. everything fits except the shirt is a little short in length. I end up giving it to my nephew which fits him perfectly and he is about 5'2'."
2.0,Love love love this idea. Cute notecard and in a nice box. But this is way overpriced considering it’s just 2 friendship bracelets that are probably worth about $1/each. The colored wraps are coming undone already and I haven’t even put them on yet. My son starts his first day of preschool tomorrow and I don’t even know if I should give this to him or not.
2.0,"They stretch a lot, so the fit was OK, but in white they are very see through!  'Fabric very thin.  I could only wear them under a dress."
2.0,Had a stain on it when it arrived inside out
2.0,Fits as expected but cheaply made. I will not order this again. I'll give the seller a 5 Star though because the item was well wrapped and came on time.
2.0,"These shoes are for myself for I have small feet of size 34. These are way too big and I have put 2 fingers inside the shoes in the back of my feet. My guess this is US size 5, definitely not for size 34. The top of the shoes shows wrinkles, the craftsmanship is not good."
2.0,Can not use this type of mask on most airlines
2.0,"The pair of these glasses I recieved have tinted, not clear lenses. The ""multi-focal"" lenses are defined, not flowing like normal progressive lenses. There is a very narrow regular area a small keyhole area of computer view and a large close up magnification area. Areas of transition are very visible. If it weren't such a hassle I would return them."
2.0,"The legs feel soft and seemed pretty good thickness for tights but the upper portion felt more like standard thin panty hose, almost a bit scratchy. I went with the PM and at 150 # they were a bit snug in tummy, not terrible but I didn't feel sleek in them. The fabric also seemed to have some odd veiny lines on them, maybe from being folded in package. May come out if washed first. Overall just don't care for them so going back."
2.0,I did not like them they are to thin on material and no support for llega or Nelly like leggings do
2.0,The bad did not feel or look of genuine leather and of poor quality..
2.0,Run 3 or 4 whole sizes smaller. Are not very well made. Exposed interior seams in waistband.
2.0,Cheap looking and bad fit
2.0,ordered 2x; package marked 2x; garment marked 2x.... couldn't even buckle.. barely fit my 125 pound 70 year old mother
2.0,"Like these but do not like how they are three separate pieces, make them time consuming to put on ans easy to lose."
2.0,"The gloves I received stink--literally. An oily petroleum smell. Tried washing them and leaving them in the sun, but the smell stays."
2.0,My granddaughter was heart broken
2.0,A lot bigger than expected. Arrived right on time.
2.0,I wear a US12 and the bottoms were a bit too big. The material was pretty thin also. I wasn't impressed.
2.0,"Not sure what I expected for $11, but I had become accustomed to University of Kansas items being quality.  I thought these glasses look cheap."
2.0,Belt twists up because of sweat/moisture and stays that way. I bought belt May 22nd and these pictures are from July 24th so only 2 months the belt has been used. I wore six days a week. The hardware of the belt has a nice finish and good quality. It is better quality than the last one I bought. I would not buy it again unless I was desperate due to the belt twisting up and curling within regardless of the cheap price.
2.0,The material is thick and weird almost like a cheap towel material not a summer dress material.
2.0,"Order many sizes up. Ordered 2xl, more like a large"
2.0,"This shirt is Kid sizing. I had to give it to my daughter, she loved it"
2.0,The earrings are beautifil however when I received them the package was a bit damaged and one of post to the earrings would not fit properly.... I have yet to have worn them .... it's ashame though because I purchased them as my everyday work earrings .....
2.0,"It does not fit right.  It is not made to fit like a normal t-shirt, and I cannot wear it.  This is a Halloween shirt with a black cat on the front and a black cat on the back, with three-quarter length sleeves.  https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bzd05dH2L._"
2.0,This dress was really nice...I had to send it back because the upper arm sleeves were way way too tight!!!  It was really strange..
2.0,Had to return this shirt. Bought a 2x size and it was awfully small!
2.0,"Family member tried this and didn't like it at all.  It didn't stretch well, and was very uncomfortable.  Sizing seemed to be right, but just wasn't really usable."
2.0,Get what you pay for and took awhile to get here form seller
2.0,Wig is to thin. You can see the cap the weaves are sewed too. Tangles easily.
2.0,Llegó manchado no me gustó
2.0,I look as if I purchased it from a dollar tree; very plain tee shirt. Nothing like the picture shows as a cute rolled t-shirt.
2.0,"The quality is exactly what you would expect to get for the cheap price, so I ended up returning mine. Looks exactly like the picture, though. On the bright side, the return process was easy and I had no problems getting my money back"
2.0,Materials are soft but the size is way bigger than the actual size. I bought for my 7 years old son but it is said for 13-14 years old(size 150) in Korean. The size should be indicated accurately.
2.0,Not as posted.
2.0,Need to have more holes in the band to make it smaller.
2.0,The materials were great and they look exactly like the photo but I bought this outfit for my son and it was way too small. I had to buy him a different Fourth of July outfit because it came too close to exchange it.
2.0,I didn't find sizing accurate.
2.0,First off the cut is big. Secondly the fabric is cheap and doesn't hold up big busted women well. Even if your a C cup don't buy this bathing suit. Doesn't stay on properly and stitching is cheap.
2.0,"Like the print,feels cheep"
2.0,"Not good quality, the elastic band broke same day, later get bigger. Don’t buy it."
2.0,"The design looked great but the leather was very cheap and the wristband was to small! I lost it at school soon after I put it on, I didn't even notice it fell off because it was so loose(I even put it as tight as I could)!"
2.0,"People are NOT joking when they say this item runs EXTREMELY SMALL.  I normally wear a M in everything, but ordered a large based on others' reviews. When it arrived, it felt like an XS. Couldn't even button it.  Had to return it, sadly, and not have it for Yankees' playoff games. :'("
2.0,Downloaded the app and got the mask to partially work using the text function for scrolling words across the mask. However none of the images downloaded so it ended up being a one trick pony. With no customer support available and no response to my question posed on Amazon i returned it.
2.0,"I purchased a purple silicone watchband and wore it for 2 months. Uncomfortable silicone (thick), the end of the band frequently came out of both free loops, just an overall pain to wear. And I usually had to check the underside and clean it. There are better silicone brands at a slightly higher price point."
2.0,"The design was nice, but these were way too big for my seven year old.  If your little kid is wanting a fortnite mask, get the ones with the adjustable ear loops.  We got one of those also and we were able to make it fit him fine.  These ones are too big to be usable."
2.0,"I was really excited to get this card case because it was exactly what I was looking for, but after about a month of use it's already broken - the case wont close and the elastic band snapped."
2.0,I gave it away.  It was extremely small. I ordered a 3x bit it was more like an extra large if that.
2.0,"I got these for my dad for Christmas. These run small so I had to return them for a bigger size which was easy with amazons return policy. However, after a couple weeks these starting tearing around the bottom. Quality is just not there. I get my dad house shoes every Christmas and have never had a pair fall apart after a couple weeks. Don't recommend these."
2.0,The color doesn't look like the picture and it's a weird material.
2.0,"The only reason why I am not returning this is because of the original cost. This apron is so small I cannot even get it on! I am not a petite person, but I am also not very large. I was very disappointed. I have never not been able to wear an apron before!"
2.0,"Fabric is extremely thin and cheap. Pictures are deceiving. I doubt it would last more than a few washes. Pattern is great, just cheaply made."
2.0,"I got this because my 1.5 year old son pees a lot at night and has diaper leaks. The leak comes out of the top in the front. These peepeepants don't have good coverage in the top/front area. If they came up higher, over his belly they would probably work.<br /><br />These might work for girls, not sure.<br /><br />I ended up just wrapping a reusable diaper liner around his waist and tucking it into his pajama pants to keep it in place."
2.0,"Think the term &#34;full length&#34; is misleading.  I am 5' 7&#34; and these are only about lower calf length.  Additionally, the skirt hangs strangely because of the fabric-on-fabric friction."
2.0,I cannot use these on my own.  I am going to need someone to help me try these out and that was not my goal.
2.0,I didnt realize this was going to be a spandex material. Its comfy but not something ill ever wear out of the house because it shows off every small flaw.
2.0,"When first attached,  work well. If worn daily,  last about two weeks.  They don't break, they just lose form and strength.  Almost useless at that point."
2.0,The fit of this is terrible and it looks nothing like the photo on your body.<br />Strings all over the place pulled. The quality is crap. I guess you get what you pay for.  In this case I paid too much.
2.0,Advertised as white but it’s more of a cream color. It’s way more cropped than it appears in the photos and the fabric is scratchy.
2.0,"I didn’t like this dress and am returning it.  Even though I am 5’10”, the torso portion of the dress is so long, and the skirt is so long it goes below my knees.  I’m also thin.  This dress looks completely awful on me but maybe will look better on a more petite, curvier girl."
2.0,I wear a M/L so I up sized to XL due to compression. It is soooo tight. I look like a 10lb sausage in a 5lb case. Not sure when I can actually fit in it. I may return it. It’s way too too small.
2.0,"Yep, if your battery dies, you're out of luck since there's now way to set the umbrella to unfolded. I'm all wet now."
2.0,Pretty top that is sized incorrectly in terms of plus size women! It fits VERY much smaller and is tightly fitted to your curves.
2.0,This dress is cute however the one I received was balled up & inside out which just says to me that it was used. Not cool. Then when I went to try it on I couldn't find the hole to put the string through to wrap it so I took it back off to find it. I found it & it looks like someone just cut through a couple stitches in the seam.  It's a shame bc it does look cute on even if I feel like the back is a little too long.
2.0,"This wallet is not very high quality. I had mine a few weeks and the glue that holds the card slots together decided to stick to one of my cards, making it difficult to remove. Once I removed the card, the thin (and I mean thin) divider material literally ripped out. This happened each time I went to pull said card out. Now it only has five card slots instead of six. This is not durable and very cheaply made."
2.0,"These seemed ok at first but the dye bled onto my pillowcases.  Ruined 2 pillow cases before I realized what was happening.  Almost appears as ink on the pillow cover.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend these."
2.0,The fit is a bit odd. Doesn't seem ideal for slim guys. They are comfortable
2.0,"This brand used to be my go to for decent quality plus size clothing. Lately, non of their plus sizes are scaled properly. Too large/long in some areas, too small/short in others. Saving grace is usually the quality of material. Sadly, this dress looks nice in photos, but the material is super cheap 70s velvet and sizing is terribly form fitting. According to the sizing chart this dress should have fit perfectly but alas, it looked 2 sizes too small from the side and back. (Front looked ok so if you just need this dress for a photo, it may work for you). Ultra tight/slim fitting looks great in small sizes but it’s not always desired in plus sizes (especially from certain angles)."
2.0,Returned it....wanted to wear it to be fashionable and it was too cheaply made....
2.0,Lights doesnt work.
2.0,The fabric was a little heavier then expected. And I’m tall so I have a long torso. The dress didn’t fit properly. It’s not cut long enough in the front so the seem sits even with your nips and it’s not a flattering look.
2.0,WAYYY TOO SMALL
2.0,Not like picture at all. Disappointing and hangs. Cheaply made.. also seemed like an off white. Elastic at top was strange and had to keep adjusting the dress. Returned. :/
2.0,Bib was larger than pictured
2.0,Does not look like picture. Way too short
2.0,"Bought this bag on June 18, 2017. Still haven't used it because the smell is the most god awful thing ever. I have washed it 3 times and soaked it with Febreeze more times than I can count. It's got a really nasty chemical solvent smell. It's currently hanging in the garage airing out... still, on July 10th. I &#34;might&#34; be able to use it in 2-3 more weeks after a few more times of soaking it with Febreeze. I like all the pockets it has, lots of places to store various items. The strap is a little wider than I usually like, so we'll see how that goes. I can't comment on it's durability yet, for reasons stated above."
2.0,These earrings are very cute but also very fragile.
2.0,Came as pictured but a screw came out before i could even wear them. Cannot return due to where I live but I'm sure it's just ONE bad set
2.0,"I'm 5'2"" 100 lbs and the small was so big, I could have worn it as a night shirt (or night gown). Very disappointed"
2.0,Actual post dimensions this item will fit would be helpful.  Any other dimensions would be helpful as well.  One size fits most doesn't cut it.  Returned.
2.0,Very thin msterial
2.0,it was very short
2.0,Cute swimsuit but the sizing for the top and bottom are way off! The bottoms are way to big and the top is snug!
2.0,It's ok for the price but it is a bit big and a little strange.
2.0,This product was advertised as stretch fabric and waste. Two different sizes were sent one 36. The 36 fit but was uncomfortably tight. The 38 was tighter than the 36. They were both longer than 30.
2.0,My feet slide to much
2.0,"The sole of the shoe has very aggressive contours for the arch, heel cup, etc.  It also has a taller heel than I would want on a sandal.  They don't match my foot well making walking in them not very comfortable.  Likewise the front strap wants to dig into the top of my toes.  Very strange fit overall.<br /><br />The problems with the contours of the sole feel like the kind of thing that will eventually break in, but I'm not sure I can even wear them long enough to do that.  They are just a weird fit."
2.0,I bought the L but it is more like a S. See trough in the white and the black. Not good. It shrunk further in the washer. Gave it to my 7 year old neighbor. (That's how small it shrinks)
2.0,"The material of the kurta is see through, you cannot wear it unless you have a long cotton slip underneath."
2.0,The flowers are very big
2.0,The bottoms show your booty crack if you don’t pull the bottoms up your butt. Chest isn’t flattering on someone with a small chest. Cute color but overall I didn’t like the suit.
2.0,"I bought it to stretch some boots out. The plugs for the stretcher won't stay in and on the pkg it says it goes to size 10, I need 11/12 but im still attempting to use it."
2.0,I really liked it but in less than a month it fell apart. The screw that holds it together is stripped and won’t reattach.
2.0,Earrings are cute but are way to large to look good. If you like excessively large earrings then they are perfect for you.
2.0,Too big and the tags were stitched on both sides front and back.
2.0,"If you have a small waist and J-lo bottom, these aren't for you. They weren't for me."
2.0,"If you have hips and a bum, these pants are not for you. When I went to put them on, I was presently surprised at the fit in the legs (They fit great!) However, when I went to button them they were so uncomfortable. The waste has no stretch, making them not a good fit for anyone with some curvy hips and bum."
2.0,I choose xxl that my size but this item seem to be L size
2.0,I was surprised that I ordered the same size I've worn for a while and they are tight!
2.0,"Ummmm, I don’t know who they use to get their measurement off of but they need to feed that person a darn cheeseburger. Runs super small. The shirt is cute but way too tight. Women’s self esteem is low enough without having to buy clothes that were designed for malnourished women in 3rd world countries."
2.0,didn't realize that the arms are a little to tight. Guess that what happens when its not allow to be fitted until the merchandise is received.
2.0,It’s not really blue light blocking it’s like noting is in it. Not lived up to my expectations
2.0,"I ordered the 1.5"" ones and two pieces of 2mm leather (4mm total) will not fit through due to the rounded edges. Order a size bigger if you can."
2.0,"Item too small and does not fit as pictured.  Material cheap, it is thin and is not long in the sleeves or length .<br />Return policy doesn’t work, their number is not working.  All efforts to contact has resulted in zero response, I’ve tried twice!<br />Don’t buy!!"
2.0,The picture is better than the actual product. It runs a little larger. I like a women's fit if I’m ordering a women's shirt but this shirt seems too loose for my liking. Wanted to return but didn’t feel like going to the ups store to drop off so I’ll just wear it around the house.
2.0,"These were too small for my face. Also, the lens bend light in really odd angles, making it feel like they are dirty when they're not."
2.0,but I still wear them sometimes
2.0,This is an ok ring for the price. Don't expect to see a high quality star shining back at you.
2.0,Fabric quality feels like pretty good quality but these leggings leave a weird bulge/space in the front instead of being flat against the skin. Will be returning.
2.0,The colors were great ! Quality wasnt so great
2.0,"Wayyyy too see-through, and it's so tight that I wouldn't want to purchase a slip wear underneath."
2.0,"Very thin and cheap. Good for a hot day because you're nearly naked. The drawstring that holds it all together will fall out when you take it off to pee, and it takes time and dedication to put it back in. It fits well when you finally get it on"
2.0,"I'm typically a small or extra small, and the former was WAY too short on my torso. It makes the front part stick straight out from under the bust, and the slits don't drape nicely. The fabric and coloring is awesome; I'm just warning you long-torso gals that it won't drape nicely!"
2.0,They arrived and weren't silver hardly at all... luckily I have a jewelry polishing cloth that removed all the discoloration. They are not real sturdy either in doing so I bent the post. They also didn't come with really backs just the plastic thingys I wouldn't call them backs. Idk overall the earrings look nice on tho once polished up.
2.0,Nice bag but based on the description I expected something more than a reusable grocery bag with a zipper. Yes I got two but for the price I should've paid half or even a third of the price. It should pass through the airport without a problem and for that reason I give it two stars.
2.0,Has a bad odor when worn
2.0,Item doesn’t look like pictured. Very cheap material. This is more or a work out or play soccer I n shirt
2.0,GLASSES DO NOT STAY SHUT……WORKS LIKE LOOSE SHUTTERS ON WINDOWS
2.0,watch made cheap
2.0,The fit was entirely too big. Sent back and got a refund. The bad part is you have to pay return shipping.
2.0,Estan bonitos pero Son muy grandes
2.0,"Cute but paper thin, came wrinkled and I didn’t want to take a chance with ironing so I ultimately sent it back"
2.0,i just got this item and looked good but I decided to write review after i used and i have to warn if you are buying this for your customers or for someone because its said 925 but its really really thin i used to do casting for 925 so im sorry to inform this but i would say they used very little 925 its and warring post (which is for back) will not hold well since its too thins well if you use only for your self its ok but better not buy if it for customers  because it will not last long.. that was very sad to found out this since i needed 925 i hope company will fix this item
2.0,"Cons: Has a horrible smell, awful material<br />Pros: Style"
2.0,"Bright Pink color!Which I  love but way to big for my wrist, it slides around… plus after I bought it, I read other reviews… it may not last very long either."
2.0,Have given  to my much smaller mother in law. One size does NOT fit all.
2.0,Very cheap and low quality but fun for sisters.
2.0,Had to return it because it was too small.
2.0,the self adhesive is not worth a darn...
2.0,"I was blown away by the quality of this watch. I got this as a lightning deal so I saved an extra couple of dollars to.<br /><br />I was skeptical that I would receive some kind of Chinese junk, but not at all the case. Everything about this watch shows me it was made to be worth much more than they sell for.<br /><br />I'm rough on things. I'm a big guy and I'll cut myself on accident and not even notice it for a long time. I'm just trying to say that anything I wear on a daily basis better be ready for a beating and this watch is ready.<br /><br />The hole in the strap shows no sign of stretch after about a month and I see no reason to think it ever will. It looks fantastic and everything functions just as it should.<br /><br />I will note that the instructions are so confusing that I gave up on them almost immediately. But you don't need a lot of instructions to figure it out. Common sense should get you there in no time.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I received this watch 2 months ago and I am now changing my rating from 5 stars to 2. I'm not sure what's going on but the watch seems to be stopping at random and then starting again. It's no use for keeping time anymore. Maybe it's just the battery, that's why I'm still giving 2 stars,  but I shouldn't have to change a battery for a watch after 2 months."
2.0,I was very excited to wear my marquis earrings but after a short time I had to remove them both because they were hurting my ears so bad. Very bummed that I can't wear them I gave it two stars because they are pretty earrings
2.0,"Incredibly disappointed. The sizing is quite misleading. I'm a standard 40 on the waist, all around brand-wise and these didn't fit whatsoever. This is the problem with buying online, never know what you're getting at and you have to &#34;depend&#34; on brands to accurately represent sizing.<br /><br />If you're a 40, go 44 or larger.<br /><br />Quality seems nice, but I've got to make 2 or 3 New Year's Resolutions before I will ever get to enjoy them."
2.0,The top is too large and the suit is made poorly.  the seams were uneven on the bottom.
2.0,"I am 5’5 135 lbs and normally wear size 4-6, I ordered a small based on other reviews and they were so long and so loose around the waist. They are sheer and wrinkle so easily so instead of ordering an XS I had to return"
2.0,Silver was scratched off and pin is way bigger than the actual prop. Will not buy again.
2.0,So cheap and fragile material. Unknits easily
2.0,"Didn't like it at all. Too snug. Looked messy, not like picture."
2.0,Nice but way way to big
2.0,"Bought for my husband. The suit jacket actually fit well, but when I received it the lights didn’t work. Replaced the batteries and still didn’t work. This is a piece of crap."
2.0,The ink ran after one wash
2.0,"I was so excited to get these, but was very disappointed with how comfortable they were. Because of their weight and length, they were very bulky to wear and quickly became sore. Still very cute, but I wish I could actually wear them."
2.0,Side seam came apart after one day at the beach
2.0,"I received the necklace and it is really beautiful but unfortunately it was impossible to pass the chain through the hole of the pendant. Since I have some jewelry tools I was able to crack the last piece of the chain and take it off to pass the pendant through it and since I managed to make the necklace wearable, I am giving it two stars because of the poor experience I had with it, otherwise I would give it just one. But what if I didn’t have the tools? And what if it was a gift? It is really disappointing and frustrating to receive a product that you are not able to use/wear."
2.0,My girlfriend is very petite and no they aren’t knee high. Colors in pictures are enhanced.
2.0,I had to cut them off
2.0,This bag was just what I wanted. Simple two pocket design to carry a few documents. Was all set to give 5 stars then the outside pocket zipper broke.
2.0,The pants are not made for men muscular men over 5”8.
2.0,"They're extremely hard. Like stiff as a board. And they run quite small. My 11 y.o boy wears a 6.5 mens in Vans just to give you reference and an 8 in Nike (Nikes run small) so I ordered a men's size 8 in these and basically they're the exact size of his foot -- no space. He'll be grown out of them by tomorrow Lol. Not only that but I just got charged $5.99 to send them back because going to the Amazon dropoff is an absolute pain in the butt and I'd rather save myself the headache, forgo the cost-free way to do it and just take em to the UPS store. Ugh. What'o ya do *shrugs shoulders."
2.0,"The ""texture"" on the bottom doesn't even grip with each other. Slipped on a few rocks at the river. Save up and get high top boots"
2.0,These gloves are super nice but they smell like they have had a dead fish inside of them! You can't even keep them in the car they smell the entire car up! I've tried everything to get them not smell bad it does not work!
2.0,For the price I was expecting a lot more. Very cheap looking
2.0,"This is a terrible fit! Got it for my fiancé to replace his current crew neck pullover and it didn't work at all. Sleeves were really long and bunched up. I'll-fitting, unflattering."
2.0,This did not come with the belt as described--otherwise it would've been OK.
2.0,The size is fine but the color doesn’t match as in the pic. Its way lighter than the given color
2.0,"Very pretty necklace, the downside is I wore it once and the silver paint came off by the end of the day :/"
2.0,"Didnt come with solar power unit, faded fast"
2.0,Writing is so small I can't read it.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I thought that these were great for about the first two weeks, as I needed slippers with some cushion, but the cushion was gone by two weeks and now my feet are in pain again."
2.0,"Nice quality, size run BIG."
2.0,Cute but really small. I am a size 8 and I  ordered a large; it is too small. It fits extremely tight around the hips and thighs.I don't think an extra-large would fit. Shipping was fast.
2.0,one of them snapped in half AS I WAS TAKING IT OUt OF THE PACKAGING.
2.0,"I was so excited for a nice, lightweight shirt that I could dress up or down. It is extremely lightweight which I like. It isn't see through so I could wear it to work but could be worn out on the town as ""going out"" clothes. However, I got an XL because I typically buy things too big and sometimes regret it but can work with too big, can't work with too small. So I got the XL and couldn't wait to try it on. It felt off, like it was sewn wrong and said weird on me. It was actually kind of uncomfortable. Then I noticed the sleeves are way too short. In the picture it kind of looks like it is supposed to look that way on the model but the way the sleeves get wider at the end, it looks like the sleeves shrunk and the rest of the shirt didn't. I do not have long arms by any means. In fact, because I buy my clothes bigger, I tend to have to roll my sleeves up or cuff them once or twice. Normally, I would ""make it work"" but I just couldn't. It looked like the shirt was too small but it wasn't! So now I'm pulling on the sleeves, which makes the shirt sit even worse, it looked and felt ridiculous. I am so sad because I had planned to wear it to work on my birthday for ""dress down Friday"". Huge let down."
2.0,My body type is just not compatible with this style of bikini.
2.0,Too small and it didn't support like the picture shows. Not very impressed
2.0,"From the description, I was expecting a long, lean, lightweight fall jacket - perfect for layering in these cooler temperatures. What I got was something short, square, shirt thin - that I would HAVE to layer to get any warmth at all. Not at all as pictured or expected. Returning."
2.0,It was misshaped after being shoved in a box and it smelt weird. But it looked like the picture I guess. I didn’t need it to look good so I would’ve kept it for what I needed it for had I ended up using it. But I didn’t end up needing it and the people at ups certainly looked at me funny when I brought this is to return lol. Fun gag gift
2.0,They tarnished in 2 weeks. I don't believe they are sterling silver.
2.0,Cute dress. Not cotton. Runs very large.
2.0,these are made in China and do not run true to size.  I normally wear L to XL (14W to 16W) they run about 2 sizes to small.  I am returning them
2.0,"Pants are see through. I was so disappointed because all of the reviews. They also have a shine to them, which I am not a fan of but that is my personal preference."
2.0,The bottom part of the dress is made from very stiff fabric which does not lay well. It gives the look of being boxy and overall unflattering.
2.0,Not true to size.  Very small
2.0,I purchased these socks for my mother-in-law.  She could put them on easily but she did not that they would come off her foot.  Ankle socks are not for her!
2.0,"I took a gamble that the other reviews were wrong.<br /><br />Sometimes you get lucky and you get something that looks like the picture.  Alas, no buttons up the back.<br /><br />The dress seems oddly skewed. Sadly, no amount of alteration will help this."
2.0,"Good lord, these are THIN. You can see every line, wrinkle and or bump under these things. Legs are wider than expected around ankle also. If you are short like me (5'3) then expect these to come high enough to sit riiiighhht under your boobs, they are higher than normal ""high waisted"". Honestly pretty disappointed in these, will most likely return."
2.0,I know it says loose so I got a size smaller size than what the chart said. Based on my measurements I should have ordered a large I decided to get a medium... it still is very loose  It may just be the red color but it looks washed out  very bland dress nothing special. Very plain. When I tried it on it looked like a saggy table cloth on me.. I am not skinny so I was hoping it would show off a little curve but the whole dress is just boring.
2.0,I was hoping for a better fit. But it was slightly short and snug and itchy... Definitely wear under shirt
2.0,Hard to find a cute dress at 5’10”. This one was<br />Too short also. It also runs small. I usually wear a medium dress and the large was tight.
2.0,Like most Chinese made product! they look good but they are way to small for the Western Consumer
2.0,"This hat is adorable, but it doesn't fit my two year old. It fits my 8-month-old just about perfectly. Unfortunately, that's not what I need."
2.0,"I was very disappointed when receiving my item. The color and sharpness of the images in the picture  is just not there. The pattern on the  blouse Is faded.  I took a picture of the top for a  friend to see, in the picture for some reason the top looks really good the sharpness and color was there. But in person it’s a disappointing. So this item I would recommend only for picture taking not to wear in public."
2.0,It’s a good bag but it’s much closer to peach than pink. Doesn’t look pink at all
2.0,"My hips dont lie. I couldn't pull the bottoms up past my knees and the bottoms wouldn't have covered half my butt cheeks. Top fit, but made my mom boobs point down, which is not flattering. I went by the sizing guide. So good luck ladies. Cute, but you should be size 2."
2.0,The material is not nowhere as it seems polyester type material the bows are sewed on the front can’t be untied at all very disqualified
2.0,"I am 5'11"" and wear a size 10.  I ordered the large skirt.  The waist is very small and tight and the dress itself is too wide.  It flares out at the hips in an odd way.  I's almost as if the skirt was cut to fit a larger sized waistband and they accidentally put a smaller waistband on it.  I really wanted to like this skirt.  The fabric is pretty and it is sewn together sturdy, the proportions are just too off."
2.0,"The band is beautiful, only a little too small"
2.0,I brought this a few months ago to go with a outfit but it was way too big.  Now almost nine months later it's still too big.  Guess he will probably be able to fix it when he turn 4.  He's only 21 months not.
2.0,Good-looking watch; works fine. Gave two stars because band broke after wearing it for only two weeks.
2.0,"The chain broke easily, but the design if all very pretty.  My daughter just changed the chain."
2.0,It looks nice but the green at the top hits me at my lower butt and the seam that connects the green with the black is felt. It feels like my panties are falling but it's actually the way the leggings feel. I'm actually sorry I bought them for that reason. I won't wear them anymore because of the feel that they're falling off my behind even though they're not.
2.0,"I ordered this because the color in the listing matched my purse. The actual color of this is not even close. I’m keeping it because it’s cute and the quality is nice. If you're expecting light blue, you’ll be disappointed."
2.0,This was a pretty ring but after only two weeks of wear the bands broke in two places...sad.
2.0,Very fragile. All but the tiger split or cracked. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Not too pleased with item fit, just was able to wear but didnt loke the fit wide and short."
2.0,"These are super cozy socks! But after wearing them for two hours, my toes were protruding thru the seams. Hence, ripped.. Waaa."
2.0,Sizes run WAY smaller than advertised. I bought large for 33 waist. No chance of fitting anybody above 100lbs.
2.0,Belt felt cheap
2.0,"I got this today in the mail. The pants were sticking to each other ( pretty sure due to all the graphics touching together in hot weather). All the white graphics on pants and shirt have yellow spotting on them. :/ It also smelled of a strong chemical odor. I'm letting it sit out for a week before I touch t again. Size 90 is for 18-24 mo. Will fit my 14 mo daughter eventually. I don't know if this material will even last after a wash but glad I didn't spend too much on this. Overall it's ok, but not good quality."
2.0,"i really wanted this to work. One stuck decent but couldn't get the other one to  get most of the air bubbles out from behind it and didn't want to dig into the lens as they are a softer pliable product.  I heated it up but maybe it was my sunglasses.  Looking through them I think they would have worked great but was too afraid to leave as is, as it didn't take much of a flick to get them off.  It could have been my sunglasses????  Maybe they had too much of bend in the lens for the lens to bend with it?"
2.0,"What I like? I guess that it gets the job done - it is an acceptable public face covering.<br />What I don’t like: 1) it itches the back of my neck  2) I am bearded, and my whiskers poke through the material - it looks like I have a hedgehog in there with me. 3) “USA American Flag Bandannas...” not manufactured in the USA. That just rubs me wrong, like this thing does on the back of my neck."
2.0,"When this belt delivered, I was impressed by what seemed to be high-quality workmanship.  The leather is thick and has a nice, matte, finish.  The buckle is large and also seemed to be sturdy and well made.<br /><br />Looks can definitely be deceiving.  I have only worn it once, only for an evening, and it’s already showing signs of damage that will only get worse.<br /><br />An edge of the buckle is now missing some of the black paint which, upon closer inspection, can be chipped with nothing more than a fingernail.  There are several scratches in the leather and it’s already developed a visible crease\indentation where the top of the buckle pressed down (pictures are attached). It looks like I threw it down and stomped on it but, alas, no - I simply put it on and wore it to dinner.<br /><br />As I’m sure others can appreciate, I have leather belts that look practically new after years and years of almost daily wear.  The fact that this one can’t hold up after just a few hours is very concerning.<br /><br />Do not recommend."
2.0,Fabric is nice but fit is strange and caused a weird dip in my hip/thigh area. Color is beautiful - I ordered it in copper. I considered taking it to a tailor but I’ll probably end up returning it.
2.0,The ring was cute I ordered my size but it was too small 🥺 so maybe size up 1 or 2
2.0,I was looking for ankle and calf coverage. The length was shorter than expected so I’m using them for ankle warmth only—nice toasty. The patterns are attractive.
2.0,"This dress looks super comfy and cute on the model but it's a poor design. The chest was way too large and I ordered a small. There are no adjustable straps on this dress and when I tried to add a supportive bra with it, the dress wouldn't hide or cover the bra. Everything was out there. It was not flattering at all. I ended up returning this dress and would not recommend."
2.0,It didn't look like the picture and the fit was too big. I gave it to my mother. The material felt rough and cheap. I didn't like it for me at all.
2.0,It's itchy and the edges are sharp
2.0,I like the drawstrings but other than that they're crap
2.0,"Quick delivery, and looks nice.  The beads are small though so mine stretched the piercing within 3 days. Now if not careful it passes through."
2.0,"Item was depicted as a loose, flowy shorts. I ordered a size up to ensure a loose fit and item is fitted in my legs and very large around the waist/belly... Not a good fit for a curvy girl!<br />The butt area was not designed for anyone with a large butt... Definitely got a gap in the back of the waist!"
2.0,"I'm a man with large wrists.  Yet, this bracelet was huge even on my wrists.<br />If you like your jewelry to be instantly noticed, this may be for you.<br />I like to wear jewelry that doesn't beg for attention as this product does."
2.0,Cute shirt but it is VERY sheer!
2.0,First photo is the product I ordered.  Second photo is the product I received.  I guess they just send whatever they feel like.
2.0,It broke after a short time. So pretty but its broken
2.0,Way too long and the material was very thin. I did not feel comfortable in them.
2.0,Felt like these could break very easily.
2.0,"The fabric on the  heel bed of the shoe actually started coming off, almost like the glue wasn’t strong enough? Very cute shoe though! Fit true to size. I’m a true 5.5 and the 6 was a little too big for me."
2.0,"Not a fan of this set. First of all, there are no pockets in the pants and they are definitely see through. The fit in the pants is akward and unflattering as well. The quality is ok but unfortunately what you see in photos is not what you get. Maybe the long sleeve set is better but I'll be returning this set."
2.0,This looked kind of weird on me but looked great on the hanger! Seemed pretty good quality. Returned it.
2.0,Small and Will definitely shrink after one wash
2.0,The blazer fit as expected but came with a stain on the lapel that will not come out.  Looks like oil?
2.0,"I don't know why they charge this much for such thin, sheer fabric. Cute design but completely un-wearable for me as I don't want to worry about people seeing my underwear every time I stand in front of a light source."
2.0,I ordered the yellow shirt and it's so see through.  I have a skin toned strapless bra and you can still see through.  I wasn't expecting that.  It also doesn't have a tag to show you what's the front or back...I wouldn't buy this again.
2.0,Cute shirt but it runs insanely big. The 0-6 month should not be advertised for anything smaller than 6 month old
2.0,They aren’t durable at all. Not something to give someone if you want it to last. Ours have un-frayed and a couple of the knots have unraveled. They are cute in the pack though.
2.0,These are not compression biker shorts and don't have  pockets.  I do like the print.  Size small fit great.
2.0,"The materials of this cord necklace are soft and flexible.  The clasp is also nice.  The measured lengths however are shorter than what I requested. I order two; 1 was 24"" and 1 was 18"".  The 24"" one was only about 20"" and the 18"" one was about 16""."
2.0,The jewels fell out of my band within the first week of me wearing it...it's cute...and it stops there
2.0,No instructions on how to set locks and no key for lock even though there is key hole. Don’t try emailing or calling support ad they don’t answer or respond to emails. Nice luggage but support sucks
2.0,I washed it before I was going to wear it and the seams are coming apart around the waist.
2.0,"I love that these gloves are water proof but because they are thick and hard to get on, getting my son's thumbs in the thumb hole is near impossible. These need to be redesigned for sure!"
2.0,I went by size chart. They were too short. Unable to return to get another size. Will not be back in time.
2.0,too large for evryday use and costs me $25.00 postage to return. it does not look like the picture at all. It should be categorize as travel tote.
2.0,It’s to thin
2.0,I wanted to love this but way toooo big. Had to retrun
2.0,"Says leather, but it is not actual leather. Looks cheap. Might be ok for cosplay."
2.0,"The dress is beautiful.  I ordered it last minute for an event and had it one day shipped for my friend's daughter.  She loved it, but when she tried it on there was a thread that was caught so the lining under the dress did not lie flat. We had to break the thread and then it was ok.  Then, we noticed several areas that were torn in the tulle on the bodice.  I was so disappointed.  If there was some quality control this would not have happened.  As it was, we were in a pickle, so she wore it to her event with a jacket covering.  For the price it was very poorly made and I would not recommend it to anyone.  It would definitely have been returned if we had something else, but there was not time to find a replacement.  It was embarrassing to give a defective product to a friend."
2.0,Soft but tight too snug
2.0,"This bracelet really deserves a 1 but it's very cute and that's why I gave it 2 stars.  There are 2 issues that you may want to consider when buying this bracelet.  The first one being the clasp.  It was very difficult to keep it open while putting it on and taking it off.  I had a friend that makes jewelry change it from a lobster claw clasp to a toggle clasp.  Once I changed it, it was great.  After a week of wearing it, I noticed that it started leaving a green tinge on my wrist.  I left it with my friend so she could change out the chain to sterling silver.  The charms are cute, so buy it for the charms."
2.0,"Fits a woman or a small head.<br />Bought it for my son in college, too small for a man 20 years old."
2.0,The color is way off! The animal print section is pink instead of the color advertised. It also runs pretty big. The two stars is for the material. It is soooo soft! Going to return and get a different color in a smaller size and hope the color is more accurate.
2.0,Fit when I put them on but as I moved around they continued to slide down past my hips!  Not good.  The smaller size did the same thing.
2.0,The shoes were somewhat cute but they were way to large for her and I acctually was not crazy on how they looked in person very baby dollish and cheap kind of felt like just cardboard
2.0,"5'0&#34;, 115lb, B cup.<br /><br />Eh. It fit through the chest but the sleeves and length were too long for my tiny frame. Item returned."
2.0,"Very disappointed. Looks much better on the model in the photo. I’m 6ft 204 pounds slender muscular build. I purchased a medium based on one of the reviews and the medium length is shorter than expected. Had I ordered a large it would be too big. Bending over doing exercises in the gym the shirt will definitely rise. Also, it doesn’t taper my body as shown in the photo of the model. It’s as if the shirt in the photo was specifically tailored to the model's physique just to sell the product. I have a nice slender muscular physique and it does not look like that on me."
2.0,The fit is terrible!!!  I am a true medium and have been for many years! These  are a sloppy large fit!<br />I will not buy again!
2.0,"the mask is pink. i ended up keeping it and adding makeup to the mask to add grey tones being it was so pink, not even flesh tone straight up pink."
2.0,"I do not have a long torso and these tanks are so short! When I raise my arms they come up to just below my belly button. I'm 5'6 & ordered a medium which fit with the exception of length. The material was just ok, colors were vivid and seemed breathable. Returning them."
2.0,I was pretty excited to get these sunglasses. But when I got them they arrived a bit beat up and broken on one side of the frames. It's nothing a little glue won't fix but remember you get what you pay for.
2.0,"It's really cool, but doesn't fit my ear.. My ears aren't even that big but I'm afraid to try and bend it to fit my ear..."
2.0,No feather as shown. Very cheaply made and cheap looking.
2.0,A very pretty design but actually rather light weight and flimsy for the price .
2.0,These straps are not good to use for infants mittens. They are too long and not adjustable.
2.0,Im a 34c. and the sides of my boobs stick out and only a little bit is covered. Runs small and i got an XL it was stil to small. Don't buy if your tatas are big
2.0,Too big for a &#34;boys&#34; watch.
2.0,I loved loved loved this product at first. It was a great pair of sports glasses for running and for softball.  I could never leave home without them for sports.  Less than four months later I took them off my head and they broke.  I even tried to fix them but because the frame is plastic I couldn’t put them back together.  I’m upset that they broke so easily.
2.0,To small had to return them.
2.0,To large of a watch
2.0,material isn't soft  at  all for pajamas
2.0,I wanted to like this dress so bad. It was sadly to small and I even went up a size.
2.0,Doesn't stand up on it's own.  The handles are so short I could barely get it over my shoulder wearing only a light sweater.  Returned.
2.0,The coat it cute but I got both a large and extra large and both are too small in the arms and across the back.  I am not a large person and usually wear a medium top.
2.0,The penguin is pretty but it broke a couple months after we bought it.
2.0,"These are comfortable and super cute, but they are not durable at all. Within one day of wearing them, they'd developed a big worn patch where my (shoulder-strap) purse rubbed against my leg. Within one wash, they'd sprouted those little unravelling balls of thread all over. It's a shame because they looked great when they first arrived and the fit is super comfortable. The thick material means they're more modest than regular leggings, too."
2.0,"The colors, red and blue, were what attracted me to this watch. The colors are very nice. Not a terrible buy for $60, much what I expected for a cheap watch, it can be an everyday wear with little worry about damage because not much lost in the price of the watch. The cheap tapered bracelet leaves much to wish for, just how long it will wear is questionable. Since this watch, for me, will see little wear, the cheap bracelet should last its expected time. The bracelet and clasp are very flimsy and cheap, the clasp could be easily bent without much effort. The 40mm size is at the very minimum acceptable for a man's watch today. No effort was made to make this watch exceptional in any manner, it is quite ordinary, and again, made very cheaply. They call it ""men's fashion"" and I suppose that is the only description that is warranted or appropriate for this watch. But for build quality, size, appearance, it is not worth it. Save your $60 for something of value."
2.0,Way too large and material was cheap
2.0,Stones fell off of one the second day I had them on :(
2.0,Cute and food quality fabric... But they're way too huge. The small would fit a 3 yr old. Go as small as possible.
2.0,This was disappointing. It’s a very very pretty shirt but I’ve never seen anything like this tiny thing that is supposed to go on a human being even a child.
2.0,"What I got was almost what I ordered.  The little feathers that stivk out of the head piece are under the mesh ribbon so the are not visible at all.  The other feathers that look like a spiral;  well there areally only 4 of them, not the many that are on the example.  Disappointed"
2.0,I loved it originally but just recently I have realized that the edges of the lock are extremely sharp and it can cut you. My husband has been wearing it for almost 3 months and last night the bracelet caught my hand and sliced it open. Not the seller's fault but you do need to be VERY careful with this bracelet
2.0,"Beautiful to look at, but is HUGE on my finger! My fingers won't touch together even when I am trying it is so bulky! I can't use it. Disappointed"
2.0,The idea of this hoodie is almost there.  The style is cute but it was unfinished.  There is a lot of extra fabric on the inside that just hangs loose and sloppy preventing the hoodie to be worn unzipped.  The bottom has this extra piece of fabric that is sewn to the bottom of a finished hem but is unfinished itself.  The sleeves are also too short but there was extra fabric in those as well.
2.0,"I ordered a size larger to be safe and its still too tight, cheap material & not anywhere near worth the $25 for this!"
2.0,"I imagine they would be good for working out but they run very small. I ordered a 2x but they were more like a large. If you can size up, I refund recommend ordering at least one size if not 2 size larger to get the right fit."
2.0,"The shoes look stylish and fit well.  However, there is no padding on the soles whatsoever.  It is not much different than being barefoot.  I have slippers which are more padded.  Slippers are easier to get on and I probably will not use these shoes very often.  If you walked on a pebble, I suspect it could be painful."
2.0,"Two stars because although the style and fabric (print K) were nice, the size made it unwearable for me. Very skinny arms.  I bought style (print E) at the same time, which is a kaftan-style and works well. Print K is a dress and certainly not ""free size"" which I believe is the new term for ""one size fits most"". That's misleading. I'd guess this is an American size 12 or 14 at most. Inexpensive and pretty, though, so I won't return it. I'll give it to a friend."
2.0,"Backlight almost nonexistent. Plus the analog time runs slow, abut 5 seconds a day. Digital time is fine."
2.0,I didnt recieved the bands as shown in the picture. The ones in the picture say Ninja on them and the ones I received had a big A on them.<br /><br />Not that it was a big deal. But the band themselves seemed like they were made out of some very loose material as opposed to elastic. They were very loose and the construction was shotty (threads were coming loose). They didnt feel like they were supporting anything and they were not tight enough for my needs.
2.0,"XXXL is also too small. I wear an XL!! Howeverr, I noticed it was the largest size and I love the jacket"
2.0,"It’s built nothing like the picture, cleavage is too high and fabric to wide. No shape at all"
2.0,Strap adjusters slip.  Every couple of days I have to tighten the straps again.  Big pain
2.0,"I like how they look, they are very cute. However, they are incredibly cheaply made and the chains for the clasp break so easily. one broke while I was trying to unclasp it and another broke when I twisted my neck. I wouldn't waste money on these again."
2.0,"This jumpsuit is absolutely stunning in the package however the fit is less than impressive. I’m 5’6, 160lbs athletic build and I normally wear a medium but after reading the comments I ordered a large. The large was still ridiculously small and I could barely pull it up my thigh. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to wearing this out."
2.0,"Size large,  The T-shirt fits perfectly, the color is very nice, the material is soft but thin. Unfortunately the letters are only stuck on individually and I can tell that they are going to come off as soon as I wash it. Received the item today and I wore it today, have not washed it yet."
2.0,"Super malleable and uneven. Used them for awhile and they looked cool if you didn't look too hard. Up close they are pretty thin and cheap. Would not buy again, I have found better quality for the same price."
2.0,Felt like I was a 4 year old blue obsessed child. These are difficult to see out of because the blue tint. They are stylish and cute but not usable or safe while driving.
2.0,"Ordered 4 pack for my bridesmaids. One of the pairs of earrings was a completely different design, and one of the pairs arrived broken. We had to glue them back together hours before my wedding. Was a complete disaster and I totally regret the purchase."
2.0,"I actually bought these to have as non slip socks to wear while I was at the hospital after having my baby and they were fine for that. I originally liked these. The problem I have is that that's about all they lasted for. One pair the ankle part started unraveling after the first wash before I even got to wear them, and another pair had a hole in it on the second wear.  They have all been worn just a couple times now, and not even all day, because I just wear them around the house in the evening almost like slippers, and they're pretty much all falling apart. I wish I had just spent a couple extra dollars to get better quality ones so I could continue wearing them now that I'm home again."
2.0,I think it runs small. Feels cheap in the material. Disappointing.
2.0,THIS IS FOR A LITTLE CHILD/TODDLER. They should have noted that in the description!!!
2.0,"I bought these bras because the wide straps etc looked very comfortable and supportive. The fit is fine, but it is by far the most uncomfortable bra I have ever owned. I would have returned them, but I missed the return window. I would say keep searching. This bra fits like a torture device."
2.0,ordered xl and too small.
2.0,"Comfortable, but not sure where people don't see that these aren't see through. You can see right through them when they are stretched."
2.0,"Doesn't look anything like the picture.<br />It looked like a thermal shirt, not the look I was going for. I ordered the grey."
2.0,"I ordered a size larger for both my 3-year-old and 1 1/2-year-old, but they were too small, so I returned them for two sizes larger and they were still too tight and now way too long.  If you have a very slender child, this might work for yours.  However, my kids are of average height and weight (per American standards).  Very disappointing because the quality is good and I love the design."
2.0,"The shirt ran a little small. Cold water was and very little dryer time. The shirt did not quite fit right. If you look closely at the picture you'll see where the shoulder seems are usually 2 or 3 inches back, with this shirt they were forward causing the shirt to hang long in the back in short in front, although you would think it would be opposite. I would not order again but have made this shirt ""work""."
2.0,Beautiful swimsuit but the bottom was much too loose; almost like the elastic was of poor quality - but the rest of suit appeared to be really good quality.  I am going to try another size to see if that was just unique to this particular suit.  It arrived quickly.
2.0,"This was absolutely adorable. After one washing, it faded out so badly I will only be able to wear it that one time. It’s unfortunate because it was really cute, really comfortable. I did take the advice of the other reviewers and I wore it backwards. Good move. I’m a little bit chesty-  LOL<br />Make sure you hand wash it in cold if you want to wear it more than once"
2.0,"I wanted to like this. But the fit is just not like shown in the picture. It fits just slightly larger than expected, but not too much. The bottom is not tapered but straight, and shorter than shown, so that it looks very boxy and almost square like on the body. Not flattering at all."
2.0,The front looks great but the back totally didn’t work. You have to be tall to fit all of those ladder back straps  Sadly had to return
2.0,Beautiful necklace I wore it every day... until it broke 😢. I am super disappointed because it’s the exact  necklace I’ve been searching for.
2.0,Tight across the chest and weirdly wide and billowy around the waist. There's an option to button it together in the back but it makes you look like you have a duck tail.
2.0,"I actually regret giving this a bad review. I like the bag. Lots of occulted pockets, comfortable, and smooth ride zippers. But, the main buckle in the front, broke in less than a week. Upgrade the plastic, or use another material, and it would be 5 stars. Like I said, I like the bag enough to keep it, gorilla tape the problem, and keep it. But damn, the break in the main plastic buckle should not have happened."
2.0,Really loved it. Fiancé had many compliments on it in the barbershop but less than 2 weeks started coming apart at the seams. Now hangs on the wall in shame only used as a back up now. Really wanted to love it and get a lot of use out of it.
2.0,"This material makes you sweaty. The seam in the front ends in a peak instead of a nicely rounded pouch. An NO, its not because I am shaped weird, it's because of how the item was sewn"
2.0,No es muy rústica
2.0,"The ears are so small you can hardly see them, & the missing clamps to hold earrings on ears while wearing."
2.0,Def NOT as big as pictured. More of a child or young adult mask. JUST covers nose and upper chin. Wanted a cute fun mask and it’s not big enough to fit comfortably. If your looking for an adult size mask keep looking. You’ll be disappointed. If it’s for a kid...great quality and color!!
2.0,Product broke 1month after I got it. Disappointed.  Very pretty but didn’t hold up
2.0,Plastic shows and if it's hot it doesn't hold.
2.0,Sound is fine.  Controls are not.  I have to take it out of the zippered compartment every time I want to turn it on or off. Forget trying to answer a call.  I have realigned it multiple times with no improvement.  Extremely frustrating
2.0,The soles flatten out too fast so after just a few times it's like walking on a piece of cardboard rather than cushiony like it should be.
2.0,It has a scratch on the pearl .
2.0,"Super cute and of high quality. Product was way smaller than stated (it’s stretchy, but was expected to be larger, so itcouldve layered over a tank)and photos and descriptions did not show that it was of a sateen finish. This was not a deal breaker, but if these things were known, I would have purcgased a larger size."
2.0,"The charm was nice, but the necklace was soo cheap!<br />I had to change the necklace in order to wear the charm."
2.0,"very small. i measured myself and decided to go with the medium.  i noticed that it doesn’t reach my ankles, so i thought maybe i measured wrong and i need to get the large. i returned it and got the large. it was a bit loose in some places but it still didn’t reach my ankle. they’re like capri pants, which i personally don’t like so i just returned them again. the material and the color were nice but the fitting wasn’t great for me."
2.0,Only cute if you’re built like the model in the photo
2.0,Super cute IRL but was way too small to fit me
2.0,"For the longest time, I have wanted a good pair of flare jeans. When I saw these, I thought that they were funky and cool. I thought they would be an excellent way to spice up any outfit. The material of the jeans is more like jeggings which is unfortunate because I was hoping the material would be like regular denim. However, they are stretchy, which can be a plus.<br /><br />They are also very long. I am 5’6, and I would have to wear them with heels or boots so that the fabric is not dragging on the floor. They were loose on the legs but tight on the hips. I was hoping that these jeans would work because I have wanted them for a long time, but they just did not. I ended up giving these pants to my sister, who has a different body type than me, and they looked lovely on her.<br /><br />Overall, I feel unsatisfied and upset with how these looked on me. The jeans were uncomfortable because they were tight on the hips and loose on the legs. They were also way too long, so they would only work if you have long legs or wear them with heels. I gave them to my sister, so I am happy they worked for someone, but I wanted them to work for me. I am incredibly displeased and unhappy with these jeans."
2.0,cute dress<br />fits nice<br />Looks good<br />knit is scratchy<br />material feels like poor quality<br />I would not recommend
2.0,I bought the black and silver one to try out to see if I liked how a septum piercing would look before I committed. The black paint started to flake off after wearing it for roughly 16 hours. I found that the silver one worked well as a lip piercing (although I wouldn't try to eat with it on).
2.0,"Looks like costume jewelry, had bought as a gift. Very disappointed, I will not be a not be giving as a present."
2.0,Talla grande
2.0,"I like the product, but the size is not true to the ones listed in their size chart. My daughter wears a size 10, which is the one I purchased for her, however, it's a few inches too short, unless it was intended to have the midriff (bellybutton) showing! In our case we do not want that, and with our time constraints, I will have to keep this one and have her wear a tank under it. I wish I would've ordered the next size up, and I wish there were reviews already letting people know."
2.0,Too Big Didnt fit right.
2.0,This band is beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.  It was almost impossible to attach the band and there are no specific instructions other than how to remove links.  After over an hour I was able to attach the band but the rhinestones got caught on everything.  Eventually it caught on something and ripped one of the side pieces off.  In spite of all this I purchased another one because I loved the look of it.  I received it and it sits in the box because I cannot get it attached after playing with it for about 1.5 hours.  On a positive note it is really pretty and worth the money if you can attach it easily.
2.0,I bought these because I have had other k bell socks that I loved. These are thinner and tighter. They  leave marks on my feet and ankles which the others didn’t and I have skinny feet and ankles.  Won’t buy them again.
2.0,"Purse did not feel secure and felt like it would have easily broke within a couple of weeks of using it.  My purses go through a lot of abuse.  And as another reviewer stated, I noticed the lining being caught in the zippers when I was checking the zippers.  I will be returning it."
2.0,Loose threads here and there. Not soft as advertised.
2.0,Hearts have a rough edge that scrape and wings dont look as good in person
2.0,"This item was really low quality and way too small.  I'm not going to bother to post pictures but, wow just shockingly bad."
2.0,If my little ones feet or socks didn’t turn black every time he wore them I’d give 5 stars. The shedding and dying is a disaster. It’s unfortunate because all he asks is to wear them all the time but I can’t handle the mess it makes after. So they stay at papas cabin now. Maybe the light colored ones are better and will try them out. Other than that they are well made on the outside and have thick enough sole he could play outside.
2.0,This shirt is beautiful. Probably should give it 4 stars for sewing quality but it's so pretty and the material is nice. I haven't washed it yet which I usually do before wearing but I was so excited when I got it I just wore it first and it did get red dye on my bra. I'm assuming it will bleed in the wash so will be washing in cold.<br />Revision<br />I finally washed this shirt after wearing it a few times and the shirt is now ruined. The dye in the shirt bled onto the white lace which I thought might happen. I washed it in cold water and even did an extra rinse cycle. The lace is now a weird pinkish color which looks awful with the deep red color of the shirt. I'm really bummed because it is a pretty shirt and it is way passed return window.
2.0,I loved the feel of the fabric and style of this top but it runs small :(
2.0,I got this watch thinking it was cool looking  but the bad thing about it is you can’t see what time it is at a glance what time it is because it’s just too busy you have to stare at it for couple seconds before you can realize what time it is maybe it’s just me I’m older
2.0,"Not very soft, super large and too bulky with my short hair."
2.0,"Not very breathable for summer; however comfortable. Size up, runs small."
2.0,"I wanted the circular glasses as the pictures show but they they are square. I had to keep these because I needed them for work ASAP at the hospital. The 2 stars is due to false advertisement. Other than that, they fit great and are not heavy on the face. They also don’t give me a headache due to the pressure behind the ears. Lastly, my eyelashes don’t touch the lens area."
2.0,"wish the material was thicker, they are see through...."
2.0,Clip broke on band. Too small for me.
2.0,I did not pay attention to what it is made of so this is my mistake. The fabric is not soft at all. Almost paper like. It will do for what I need it for. More disappointed at the one button hole not being open.
2.0,"The size is too small, for my 4 year old, very disappointed 😔"
2.0,"There isn’t anything particularly special about this shirt. It’s not flattering due to its short, overly wide cut. The fabric is thicker than a t-shirt; almost like a sweatshirt. It is comfortable, so it’s something to wear."
2.0,It’s a nice watch and it works but the analog dial gets in the way and although it has a function that moves the hands aside it’s to much hassle for a watch I’m using to work out with I returned and have re ordered the same style without the analog hands
2.0,Arms are long and the hand holes are to wide around the sides way to snug. Picture looked good.
2.0,No se quedan puesta en las rodillas de mis bebés se  le salen y se las he puesto de diferente formas y nada no vale la pena comprarlo
2.0,"The size and fit was great, but the color of the gold made it look cheap. I bought this to layer with other necklaces but have only been able to find one necklace that matches this gold color."
2.0,Product was somewhat cheesy but I guess it followed the description. The seller was timely and I received the product earlier than expected.
2.0,Straps were too long making the dress show half my boobs. May try to find a way to shorten the straps because otherwise I like the dress. Didn't come with a free necklace though
2.0,"The diamond is not sparkling. These earrings are beautiful in the picture, yet not when you put them on."
2.0,"Thick cheap material, which looked somewhat washed out. Also, the fit was terrible and stuck off at the sides."
2.0,Runs small. Thin fabric. Cute design
2.0,The earing I got were mismatched.
2.0,Disappointed.<br />Almost no sparkle.<br />Do not recommend
2.0,Beautiful to look at but the clasps are cheap<br />And don’t close correctly I kept having to secure them to my ears every few hrs very sad otherwise beautiful just cheaply made
2.0,I love the wallet and would have perhaps been my favorite wallet to use. I however have been using it for about a week or so and am already starting to see some of the stiching come apart.
2.0,Snags extremely easily
2.0,Saw them at 5 dollar section at TJ max. They are really pretty but extremely fragile.
2.0,It was nice however the size is little bit large.
2.0,"Soft material. True to size. Image wasn’t sharp, a bit on the blurry side."
2.0,"I loved the necklace. It was beautiful. However, it broke the very first night I wore it out. I didn't fondle with it or anything. I just felt something dangling, and the rhinestone part fell off. I'm still looking for someone to fix it, because it is too late for me to return it. The material was kind of cheap. Guess I got what I paid for."
2.0,"I have been using these for a few weeks and my pillowcases are dark and thought these were the greatest. But went to a hotel, a couple of hotels with white pillowcases and the eye mask left black marks all over it. I wasn't sure if the hotel is going to charge me because they were really dark spots all over. My biggest thing is getting that ink into my skin. I will stick with Mack's brand which I've been using for years no ink comes out on those.<br />UPDATE: To all the people who disliked this, it really does make your white pillow cases spotty and doesn't come out with regular washing, So I have a feeling these unlikes are most likely for the company.  I did wash them and that helped but make sure you do wash them or you'll have ink or dye can seep into your skin and who knows what the dye is made of."
2.0,Size up... runs small..<br />Very thin material
2.0,This is another one of those really strange materials. I don’t know what it is about dresses on Amazon lately but they’re all made out of almost plastic. Super gross and see through to boot
2.0,They came with one earring broke off the hook
2.0,The band appears to have been used - some of the holes are slightly larger - and the watch did not come with any spring bars.  I'm disappointed.
2.0,The material wasn’t as soft as expected... it didn’t fit nice... I wasn’t that happy with it... gave it away to good will.
2.0,Very thin material actually see thru. Not worth the money. Very disappointed. It came from China so it takes forever to get it as well.
2.0,"Again, not an x-large....too small"
2.0,Sizing not accurate. XL fits more like a medium.
2.0,Ran at least 2 sizes to small
2.0,When wearing indoors could not see. Makes better sunglasses.
2.0,Very nice looki g leggings the do feel great when on they are very soft the only thing about them is they are super thin so you can see skin through them
2.0,It looks like it is made well.... but it was way too small.  returning
2.0,"Not a fan! It's seamed on both sides making it not very loose. I like the colors and the idea of it, just wish it was a little looser. (Yes, I went by my actual size)."
2.0,"It would be perfect with a belt or long and flow but I can't do either because it stops at my shins!! It's lightweight but almost sheer. Its comfortable enough, but not enough to wear in public..."
2.0,The shape is not what they described after you pull the string. Two layers only and really thin.
2.0,Balls fell off with first wear pretty easily. But the fit is nice and the sweater looks fine without them.
2.0,The material is very cheap quality. I ordered a white and it is very thin and see through. Will return the product.
2.0,Ordered an XL for my 12 year old son.  Normally wears a youth XL or small mens.  It barely fit.  Then one wash and it shrank.  Now shirt unwearable.
2.0,I was so hoping that these would work but wore them once and they look like I’ve been in a cat fight (and I don’t have a cat)!!! Pulls all over them!!!<br />Only wore for about 2 hours . Could have probably sized down because they bag at knees. Disappointed
2.0,It should be on sale for 25 bucks. Very cheap feeling. You've been warned!
2.0,bad quality. very small.
2.0,Don't buy these unless you have a very narrow face.
2.0,Bag is way smaller than is depicted. Seems like a really nice bag but way too small for what I need. I would recommend that the company provides the accurate measurements of the the bag.
2.0,"The chain is amazing and so cute but the nodse rings fall out very easily, and are easy to lose. Wish they sent extra nose rings just in case🤷🏼‍♀️"
2.0,Too narrow at toes.  Returned
2.0,Very small. Not like the other Adar products I’ve purchased!
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:c2a1818ef7c1a97354aab18cc948fbc5]] This was a month after wearing. The person who did the infomercial it Walmart says you can swim,sleep ect and it wont tarnish. Look at the photo and you will see thats a lie.  I've kept this debating if its worth sending back and replacing for $5 to turn around and replace it again monthly if I wear how I intended to. Just buy real gold. Dont waste your #"
2.0,"It said order 1 size up from what you wear, so I ordered xlarge. Very nice material except it didn't fit. I normally wear a large in sweat pants. So I have returned the product an ordered a size up from the xlarge."
2.0,"This shirt just seemed to be put together weird.  The sleeves were a little tight, and long and didn't fit right under the arms.  The body of the shirt was alright, but then really tight at the bottom.  It just seemed like he took different sized of shirts and randomly put them together.  Then after I washed it, the gnomes faded quite a bit.  Was just overall disappointed.  Also, the shirt took a long to deliver."
2.0,"The shirt was as expected, just arrived several days too late."
2.0,These socks get 2 stars for cuteness and that's where it ends. The heel keeps sliding off your feet. I've only worn 1 pair. Uncomfortable.
2.0,"These glasses didn’t match the description. I ordered 1.75 diopter glasses and 2.25 diopter glasses (twice!), but I received 1.5 and 2.0 (twice) instead. If these aren’t available in 1/4 diopter increments, they shouldn’t be advertised that way. I didn’t see any evidence that these glasses are blue blockers, either visually, or by using some online tests. I decided to keep one pair just to have around, even though it wasn’t quite what I ordered.<br /><br />This is all too bad, because the glasses themselves are a cut or two above standard cheesy readers. The earpiece hinges are flexible and sturdy, and the lenses are mostly free of clouding and distortion from edge to edge. If you’re looking for these glasses with a diopter 1/4 between whole and half, based on my experience you’ll probably be disappointed.<br />FOLLOW UP Feb. 19, 2022:<br />I decided that the pair of 1.5 diopter glasses I received in error (see above) would work better than what I had actually ordered, so I tried to order 2 more pairs. I received 2 pairs of 1.25 diopter glasses instead. I returned them and tried again. Again, they came with the wrong strength. I have now ordered 7 pairs of this product, and NOT ONE ORDER HAS BEEN RIGHT! I give up, and I recommend that anyone tempted to buy these gives up before they even start."
2.0,These coats are thinner than I expected. NOT warm. If you're going to buy a trench...than buy a trench! don't waste your time with these.
2.0,Not nearly as nice or cute as displayed in the pictures.  Very cheap plastic look and feel.
2.0,"Material is definitely not sweat proof. I got the grey medium, which ties at the bottom.  My little bit of sweat seemed like it was on display, my cotton t shirt would have been more dry. Also the ties at the bottom are too short, you don’t have enough material to tie a bow or double tie it. Tying it in one loop falls out while working out as I’m sure BubbleLime can imagine that. $17 for this, i’d probably spend $25 and buy a Nike or something more sustainable for a workout top."
2.0,"Didn’t fit like the picture, arms are not the same as the picture.."
2.0,shrinks easily and is translucent
2.0,"The shirt itself was fine. Fits a bit small, so go the next size up. Just a long sleeve tee with quality reflective vinyl. But the pocket...WOW! The pocket starts about the bottom of where a normal pocket would. I put a pen in there and had bruises underneath my man boobs."
2.0,The white shirt had two stains on it.
2.0,It comes a lot bigger than what it looks like in the photo. I bought them to look nice at my job but they cover almost my entire ear & I cant put my phone on my ear cause it presses into my neck & hurts.
2.0,The size chart is not really accurate.
2.0,My child has sensory issues and wears noise cancellers every day. I wanted to try a brand other than the Snug ones. Mistake. These Hear Teks are not quality. First thing to go was the flimsy plastic covering the headband. Next the foam inside gave out and crumbled. Then the ear cups started coming off of the headband. Save yourself the nonsense and just get the snugs. They last for years.
2.0,Low quality shirt. Buttons don’t work. Well they do but the fabric is so low quality that it ripped of the button for me. I got this shirt to breastfeed with and it does not work like i intended it to.
2.0,The printed fabric turtle furs lose their shape - get all loose and baggy around the mouth - in a way that the solid colors don't.
2.0,"I bought this for a friend's child's birthday. Honestly, I was kind of disappointed with this product. The bag is a super cheap, thin fabric (like the drawstring bags that are always given away as free merchandise that break after 2 uses). The bracelet and headband are a little better quality, but I was expecting more for $19. I'll keep it because I know the recipient will like them, but for anyone considering buying this, just know your $19 isn't getting you much."
2.0,I ordered this for my husband for Christmas gift and it was an X-Large but it was still to small. I did not return it because my son could fit it but want to let you know the product runs small
2.0,Thought the leather quality is poor and won’t hold up through the riding season.
2.0,"This top was awkwardly cut and the neck straps are 18” long. They are thin and not stretchy, and when tied tightly ( as needed to hold up my boobs) dug into my neck. This top might work better for women with natural cleavage not wide spaced breasts"
2.0,"The size is accurate and it fits good. I was shopping for a single threaded barbell and thought I found it. Buyers beware, it's threaded on either end."
2.0,Fit is too loose...they don't compress anything and bunch under the foot.
2.0,"I wanted to like these so much, but was underwhelmed with the quality. The nose pieces where the glasses sit on your mouse, were already loose. One of the ear pieces had an extremely bad smell, like the back of a piercing  that hasn’t been cleaned in years. The lenses themselves are cute, but the rest of the construction around them are cheaply done."
2.0,"My daughter picked this out and I didn't really look closely at it before I ordered. When it arrived, I was shocked at how thin and see through it was. The fabric feels nice, but its not something to wear in a co-ed house. Next time I'll check more closely at reviews and the product itself."
2.0,"I received the bag on-time. The bag looks good. However, I can’t even begin to describe the smell when I opened it. It smelled like seafood (crabs to be specific) was stored in the bag. The smell is that bad. I had to return it."
2.0,"The color of this purse is gorgeous and the overall quality of the material/ leather is okay. The metal clasps and zipper pulls are very thin and weak. One zipper pull broke a minute after I unpacked it and a clasp holding the shoulder strap snapped a week in, causing my bag to plummet to the ground."
2.0,When I washed them where there was an ~Hook eye~ it rusted.
2.0,"I was excited to receive them, but unfortunately I ended up being disappointed. Item was broken and it is not for women with small feet."
2.0,SO not worth the price.  Not even well made.  And very light in weight.
2.0,"The dress fell good, color as described.  This dress runs extremely large."
2.0,"This broke shortly after the Amazon return policy lapsed.  I'm bummed, it looked and felt awesome!"
2.0,Super itchy and not as long as pictured
2.0,Jersey has a really weird fit.  It doesn't fit like a regular basketball jersey. It's a bit narrower in the chest but has more room in the belly/waist area. Makes for an odd fit and look. Honestly don't think I'll wear this around and it's been relegated to my pile of workout clothes I don't wear out.
2.0,It’s great for the discount. The material is nice and sturdy
2.0,"These are comfy but deceiving, I was under the impression they would be a tighter fit based on the photo and description but when I received them they were much more baggy than I liked and I even ordered the smallest size."
2.0,"I want to start off by saying I bought this item to prep a get home bag. It is what I would consider the perfect size.<br /><br />That being said. Within 10 minutes the snap that is on this pouch against your back broke without any force. The item also is uncomfortable to wear for any time longer than 10-30 minutes with any kind of weight in it. The Molle attachment areas are ok but leave very little use for the included mini pouche. I wish the product was better, but I’m sending it back tomorrow."
2.0,"This anklet broke twice the first day I wore it. I wasn’t even doing anything just hanging out with friends, playing some board games. Anyway, it’s super cute and delicate. You really have to be careful when you wear it. Didn’t really expect much since it was priced very much but a bummer that it literally broke twice the first wear."
2.0,The color is video but the material is cheap.
2.0,It felt kinda cheap and the opal and the moon are plastic didn’t feel like quality jewelry i usually use i ended up buying something different
2.0,Was not the right size and had an extremely strong smell to the point I had to put it outside. It’s so cute but the size it said to get was not the correct size.
2.0,Smooches boobs
2.0,"Pendant is pretty, but chain only lasted 2 months before breaking, very thin."
2.0,"Although this is cute, it’s not the sweater I ordered"
2.0,"looks bigger in picture,than it actually is."
2.0,Headband is very smAll. Not Made the best for the price.
2.0,"These run incredibly small. I bought them to wear for work while I’m pregnant. Ordered the medium (it’s a men’s medium) and it fits just like a women’s medium would. The material is nice, a bit see through, but they are just incredibly small."
2.0,"Extremely cheap, smells weird and doesn’t fit right"
2.0,"They're nice, but they run way small."
2.0,Cheap looking colors are fadded
2.0,"Not too good looking, feels cheap."
2.0,This shirt is a good 3 inches narrower than the men's 2XL shirts I bought at Kohl's for less money.  I definitely would not recommend buying this shirt.
2.0,Could not get over my head. Had to cut and reattach which did not look good and came undone.
2.0,"Well, as my fault I should have known this was not what was described. You have to keep playing like it because it keeps getting off-center if you know what I mean. I hope this helps"
2.0,Small fit order up size
2.0,"Terrible made pants. I soon I got them, the botton on the waist broke off. I was very disappointed with pants"
2.0,The cat pictures are really cute until you put the socks on. Then they are so stretched out of shape. Also not easy to put on or off.
2.0,"I've decided that I don't really care for the graphic after all, but this is not anyone's fault but mine. However, the shirt itself is not comfortable on any level. It's much tighter and shorter than any other XX shirt I own, and the material feels stiff and scratchy rather than soft and smooth, and somehow you can actually feel the screen printing through the shirt as if you were wearing it inside out! I much prefer v-necks but, again, that's no one's fault but my own, but it would be nice to at least have an opening that isn't so tight around the neck. Finally, this shirt was the most expensive of the three I purchased. I would not recommend."
2.0,There  okay
2.0,I had to return this top. the size was alright but the material and fit was just off. . . . not at all as I expected. It bunches in the front and it has a strange seam across the back.
2.0,I wore this blouse for 2 hours and it massively wrinkled.  I can’t go all day at work looking like this blouse.  No body to hold the fabric.  So embarrassing at the office.
2.0,"The bands were too small as other reviews have suggested. They claim to be 26 mm at the inside but it's actually the outside. I do like the how pliable the rubber is to fit around the metal clasp of my Garmin Forerunner 225 so I am keeping them. However, I'm disappointing in the inaccurate size. Hoping they at least last a year or two."
2.0,"These are very cheap, flimsy glasses.  I know you get what you pay for, but they are not even worth that.  They sent mostly yellow and green and two blue - none of the other colors shown in the picture.  Many of them had arms that had come off or lenses that had popped out.  They'll snap back together but not a good sign.  Definitely not worth it."
2.0,this is an asian size small which is an extra small in the states!! this shirt is kind of see-through and it's too tight on me. not worth the wait and not worth the money. bootleg ripndip shirt!
2.0,"Resulto ser muy pequeña, no es para uso de adultos"
2.0,"You get what you pay for. These masks do the job, but I have a smaller face so it is constantly falling past my nose. It is a bit annoying to have to pull up over and over."
2.0,The design of the dress is gorgeous but it is made out of the material you see for costume dresses & that makes it oddly shiny & also uncomfortable to wear. I returned mine
2.0,It is way thinner than I expected.<br />Definitely not as heavy as described.<br />I would not buy it again.
2.0,WAY SMALL !!!
2.0,I love this shirt. It just doesn’t fit like the photo.
2.0,I buy these for quinceanera gowns and this hoop skirt can't even support tulle. It became misshapen even making more of an oval then circle. Did not like the quality at all wish I could return.
2.0,"I bought 2 of these bracelets. Though they are nice looking, they're huge.  If you have a small wrist ( like I do )  it doesn't sit well on the wrist. ( flips under )  One of the clasp broke off the first time I tried it on. I'm sure I could have returned it, but instead I took it apart and made a necklace from the middle tree charm and gave the other one away."
2.0,not the best of quality.  but they do the job.
2.0,rides up on my 5 year old.
2.0,Fit perfectly but came in creased in half on one end so the choker is permanently bend out of shape and looks ugly and damaged in that one spot.
2.0,"After one time laundry wash, the cloth shrinked to super small!"
2.0,"I find nothing elegant or stunning about this ring, but stunningly small.  Very minute stones on a thin stickpin width band barely teeny stone, not tiny stones.  I don't suspect that the poorest person would want this as an engagement ring. Maybe a small child could wear it, but not a full size adult.  Sorry, The stones are so small you'd need a magnifying glass to see it adequately.  I'm giving this to my 7 year old granddaughter to play with.  I believe the stones will fall out very soon in daily wearing.  I gave this 2 stars only because I'm a nice person and dislike having to put someone off the grid of worthiness. Pay a little bit more at the local pawn shop and get a nicer bigger stone at least 2 pts.found in paved stones used in setting hundreds of stonesin a paved stone ring. To add insult to &#34;whaaaat!!!!!&#34;, the weak &#34;metal&#34; holding the barely there &#34;stones&#34; are so thin...wait on it.........will release the stones any second now and you'll never find them again.  Get the girl at least a 1/4 carat from a pawn shop if you can't afford better than what here."
2.0,These hoops bend easily ……… can’t wear then very often.
2.0,The show fell apart after 4 uses. Could be overall quality of the shoes or we received a bad one.  Will contact the vendor for a return or exchange and see how they respond.
2.0,"The material was way too thin and clingy. The length and cut of the dress was fine, and looked better with a belt. But it didn't feel comfortable since the fabric was so flimsy. Overall the polka dots were also too much on me."
2.0,"I loved the print - love the length. However the underwire - on both the supposed d and dd sizes was small. I am not HUGE breasted but do wear a d cup - it was flattering and cute so my best friend also purchased one. We both wore them on vacation and discovered the underwire moved weird and hurt. She gave hers to me because of the underwire issue, thinking it was just maybe too small (since she had the bigger bust size) - but it isn't. It's the same fit with both sizes. And it HURTS.<br />In fact, I didn't like it so much that I left it on vacation. Four Thumbs down for hurting the boobs."
2.0,This bag was too small.  thinking of sending it back.
2.0,This was a gift and the recipient said it was much too small.  I will have to return.  It did not have enough slots to put credit cards and other<br />small inserts.
2.0,"I normally wear an XXS or XSP so a small fit perfectly in this blouse. I want to like it, but there are too many details for one shirt - pearls, lace panels under neckline cutouts, spike-style texture, and puff sleeves. Also, the material doesnt breathe which is not comfortable in humid weather. Wore once, was completely uncomfortable, and tossed it in the donation box."
2.0,It looks super cute but it is too small.  It was supposed to be xxlarge but not even close
2.0,background color behind poppies is a light (seafoam?)  and there is some blurring of the foliage ... probably ok for the price but I was disappointed.
2.0,"These were a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves them! I just wish the sparkles were not coming off, they are starting to look old after 4 days."
2.0,"The product was heavier than expected, and not usable at any distance from the mirror.worked well with handheld mirror."
2.0,It's darker than the pic not too excited about it
2.0,I loved this band the first two days I wore it it’s so cute and so comfy but the downfall is that it gets dirty so fast none of my other bands collets the dirt like this one it’s the craziest thing I have ever seen my solid white one even stays white but this one after wearing for one week only it’s so dingy looking tried cleaning but only made it worse:(
2.0,These earrings should be labeled as children's size. So beware! They are so small and I got them as a gift for an adult woman. I should've known since it does say 4mm.
2.0,"The dress is pretty, but not the best quality. I’m 4’11 but  I ordered a L but it’s still tight around the hips. I considered having it altered because it was a good price, but the material itches and it’s not worth the discomfort. I’m disappointed because it looks so nice on the model."
2.0,"Returning because it is clearly Asian sizes. I bought an XL when in the US, a L would suffice. I could barely get it over my hips. Runs VERY small!"
2.0,Awfully deceivingly small. Beware!
2.0,The part that goes into the way is too big. Very hard to get into the ear hole. Otherwise very pretty.
2.0,Wore holes in them pronto
2.0,"The pants are very loose, very far from a slim fit"
2.0,"The dress is pretty, no defects but it's too stretchy for my taste which makes most people feel like they are fat, stretchy fabrics make you look 10 pounds heavier, unless you're blessed with a good body. Overall it's a good dress, just wish it wasn't too stretchy and that they had something between a medium and large."
2.0,"they sent me a medium and I ordered an extra large, shirt is cute, and very soft material, just wish it would have been the correct size!"
2.0,These gloves are o. They don’t keep my hands warm and are on the thinner side
2.0,It is a cheap copy of the original. Material is a little harder and the mold markings are more pronounced. For the money it seems like a decent deal but that’s assuming that the material holds up. Everything seems to fit ok. It’s a pretty direct copy..
2.0,The size which is very small
2.0,"Gets 2 stars for the guitar being good, the wig was so nappy and looked so bad it couldn't be brushed or fixed in any way to be worn, so we did not use it and had to go the party city to get another one."
2.0,"I liked the product, but the velcro flags that come with it weren't in the package. I was highly disappointed. They make the hoodie."
2.0,Oh my this thing is super itchy. If I wanted to wear it I would have to wear a long sleeve shirt underneath which defeats the purpose I got it for. I probably will end up donating it.
2.0,I love the ring don’t get me wrong but I order the largest size and I didn’t fit my fingers. I am a size 9!
2.0,Black flakes off very easily
2.0,The clamps came off as soon as I opened it. The color is not the same as Paimon's halo
2.0,"Love the size, disappointed to see it’s made in China & the “tooled” section doesn’t appear to be hand tooled.  I’ll carry it, but disappointed in the quality."
2.0,"looked better in pictures than on myself, just didn’t  love the look"
2.0,Wearing a pair for only the third time and notices I already have a hole in the heel...!<br />(I guess you get what you pay for)
2.0,package says L tag says XXL and it is neither
2.0,"Got this for my teenaged daughter. Within a couple of months of use or ever less, one of the straps broke. She was heart broken"
2.0,So beautiful  and perfect!! Love the quality!
2.0,"This sweater is made of acrylic and was vacuum sealed in its packaging. After I washed it and hung it up to dry, it was very wrinkly and feels scratchy. I honestly was expecting a better blend of fabric for the price."
2.0,"I ordered these thinking they were mirrored, and would have a bright color like the picture. They are in fact transparent, pale, and a bit muted. There's nothing misleading in the product description, but I was a bit disappointed."
2.0,This might work indoors but it certainly didn't work for me outdoors when the temperature is below 40 degrees.
2.0,It doesn't cover my butt it only comes about three quarters of the way. So I have to use it as a shirt
2.0,SO SHORT I ordered a large and this fit like an extra small. It fit around the waist but was so short my whole butt would have hung out!!
2.0,The straps are cute but there was no instructions and I have no idea what to do with the silicone pieces it came with.  They are also large for kids glasses.
2.0,I really wanted to like these shorts but they awkwardly fit. I had to return them.
2.0,small to size and SUPER thin
2.0,Disappointed. The bracelet I received looks nothing like aquamarine. Not blue but purple.
2.0,Very cute/attractive but much smaller than expected even ordering size up.
2.0,"This shirt fit nice up top, but it flares out at bottom and is too short"
2.0,"Looks like a cheap Halloween costume. I read previous reviews and they were good, but the material is thin fabric and doesn't look like faux suede at all."
2.0,The product I received has a plain front. The one I ordered showed a pattern.
2.0,"For the size, there is zero support.  Maybe I am too generously endowed for this to be a proper supportive bra."
2.0,"This is a cute romper, but is not true to size.  I think I would like it if I lost enough weight to fit into it."
2.0,Arms are not flowy like shown dress size fits smaller than size chart.
2.0,The blue stone part fell out about a month ago and it's just not the same.
2.0,"It's a nice jacket but it's small even though I ordered 3 more, it arrived on time but I would not buy it again (3-4 years)"
2.0,They were not as cute as they picture. They had a bad fit to them which is why I did not keep them.
2.0,"I thought this was a very nice looking petite ring.  When I received it, unfortunately, it had a sharp edge on the smallest stone. It may have been sharp enough to cut (either my hand or my husband's when we hold hands). I returned it asking for a replacement (the supplier - Jude Jewelers, was very responsive to send replacement!). When I received the replacement ring, it too had the same very sharp edge on the smallest stone on the side. I decided to return it for a refund; I didn't want to take a chance on getting another flawed ring. I believe that the seller should do better product quality control. I will say, however, that Jude Jewelers did a very nice job to send the replacement quickly and have other very nice looking stainless steel rings. Thank you Jude Jewelers!!"
2.0,"On a positive note, I don't think it could be much easier to adjust the size of this belt. The problem is the loop on the belt extends beyond the loops on my jeans, which basically makes this belt completely unusable. Unfortunately, now that I've cut it down to size, I can no longer return it."
2.0,Even when I wear them it still doesn’t help the unfocusing of my eyes.
2.0,"Ordered an XL and received a XXXL.<br />The dress was too big, but not too big, which means it runs small."
2.0,Size runs small still fits but tighter than what I expected
2.0,"The quality is great for the price on these. They are sewn well and made in Canada. But they fit extremely way too small even in the XL size! I'm a 33'' in the waist with no tummy. I can wear them around the house, but would not dare wear them to the gym unless I was selling my ''manhood'' to the public! LOL! If you are somewhat of a big guy like me, I would not recommend these little shorts. They are better suited for sleeping underwear."
2.0,super cheap material.  Poorly made
2.0,"Material very cheap, not worth the cost!"
2.0,Very small not stretchy or giving
2.0,I am so disappointed because all of these socks gradually started getting holes in the bottoms after only 3 months of wear. I rotated the 6 pairs socks for equal wearing but now they are ending up in the garbage. Next winter I will spend more because socks should last longer than 3 months!
2.0,The bottoms fit well but the top was just way too big. I ended taking it to my seamstress to tailor.
2.0,"the fit around the arm holes doesn't seem to lay straight<br />this edges are not hemmed, arm holes or double ruffled bottom edge; it's simply a good t-shirt material cut with scissors and/or straight edge<br />an all right shirt for the price paid; don't like the postage was nearly as much as the shirt, and when ordering two shirts, had to pay twice the postage, not just a slightly increased postage ...... considering both shirts came in same envelope :-("
2.0,Tank tops were too tight. I ordered a size larger than usual because I really wanted roomier and comfy. Apparently I should have gone 3 sizes larger.
2.0,Cheaply made poor design no lining uncomfortable to use. Buy for appearance only
2.0,Cute and fits well but sleeves are extremely itchy and uncomfortable. Disappointed.
2.0,Great quality. Hoodie was smaller than normal adult small.
2.0,It was to small...it said 32 inches and it was more like 20 inches
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:db16064767154da5fdba9c495e3e6bf5]] This just wasn’t the material for me.  It wasn’t very soft.  Maybe too much polyester (95%).  Just was too clingy.  I liked the cut out neck, but not the material and fit at all.  I would size up too if ordering.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"
2.0,"purchased 2 joggers, one perfect quality material and size black, the second one green same size was too short pants arms and butt, not enough material like, zipper that sticks your chin, totally different joggers costing the same."
2.0,Does not cover like i was hoping. i wear a 34G bra
2.0,The picture is very cute and the style was attracted me to the shirt in the first place. The fabrication was nice however I could not even get my hand/wrist into the hole to put it on so thus a return.
2.0,Xl size not xl. did not come close to fitting. Gave to my teenage nephew.
2.0,This is a beautiful necklace but it didn’t come with the class. Very disappointed
2.0,"Was not very impressed, they were bulky and didn’t work for me."
2.0,"And there are CAMELS, HORSES, and STINKY CHICKENS in that barn.<br /><br />I cannot imagine any way to get rid of the smell; AND I SHOULDN’T HAVE TO!!!! SHAME"
2.0,Muy bonito el reloj. Lo único que no me gusto es que las manillas son muy largas.
2.0,This dress took about two weeks to arrive. It  is pretty but it was awkwardly small. It is too short and lands well above my knees and bust line is in the middle of my chest. I am big busted but according to the chart XL should have fit. Be careful because return shipping is not free!
2.0,The nose pieces are awkward as they are VERY gold and kind of stick out.  They sit a little funny.
2.0,Magnet fell off first day and now it doesn’t stay tight. I’m allergic to silicon bands so I needed a metal band. It’s comfortable while I’m working. I sweat a lot and moisture gets behind the screen protector and doesn’t allow use of the touch screen. Very cheap screen protector. Metal band is wearing out only after a few weeks of wear.
2.0,Garbage please don’t waste your money
2.0,I bought them because it said surgical steel. But no my ears got irritated after 2 days. If that's not an issue then they may work for you.
2.0,Runs small and I am small!
2.0,Not a material I was expecting. Style was formal but the material was not. Thought it would be flowing but it was spandex like
2.0,It arrived on time but with a hole in the thigh I need to return it but I've been busy with work I didnt even get to wear it out disappointed
2.0,"runs very small , beautiful ring but I ask for a 9 and it looks like a 5. I had to give it away"
2.0,"This is a cheap sweater. I’m often wary of purchasing from Amazon because the clothing quality is generally awful, but goodness gracious, this one was particularly disappointing. It started off cute. A little short for me, but I’m 5’9” so I try not to hold length of clothing against it. It had a fairly flattering shape, though I absolutely could have worn a medium instead of a large. It was SO SOFT. And the color was gorgeous. But the fabric of the belt stretches out. You can have it tied very securely and you will literally be stopping to re-wrap and retie every half hour. It’s super frustrating. Similar to the waist band fabric, I noticed the neckline stretches out. I wore this over a tank top and it was fairly warm in 50 and windy, but the wind caught the wrap neckline just a bit and I had to actually hold the sweater on so it wouldn’t blow off my shoulder. Maybe I got a dud, but I don’t recommend it."
2.0,My daughter loves the purse.  After 3 weeks some of the threads have already started lulling out.  Could have been constructed much better.
2.0,"sizing is very off, I had to throw these away, they would probably only fit a child or teen."
2.0,"Product was smaller than expected, bracelet was very small and it was too thick. I actually gave it away to a younger coworker."
2.0,"I'm a 12/14 and ordered the large, based on size chart; could not even get it over my head.  Ordered the XL and managed two buttons.  The dress was well made and not flimsy, which rayon can be.  The yellow was the right color, love the style - it's timeless - and length and sleeves on the XL were fine, but man, not the torso.  So sad, returning both tomorrow."
2.0,"I had purchased the black Be Kind shirt and I love it, so thought I would buy another with a diff design and color.  I chose the pink coffee and sunshine shirt and wow, disappointing.  Thin fabric, not the same quality at all.  I’ve returned it but now am afraid to buy a different black shirt because I don’t want to keep returning them."
2.0,Not a real soccer scarf. Felt like material with tassels sewn on ends. Not the normal knit kind.
2.0,"The picture of this product is very deceiving, they advertise gold tint however these glasses only have a very small amount of gold tint and are more pink or maroon when worn. To get the gold look you have to tilt the glasses at odd angles to.ever see a gold reflection. Now it's possible that the wrong product was shipped, but it appears these are the right ones. That being said the fit was good they are small frame but the bridge was wide enough so they didn't seem like kid glasses not bad for the price there other tinted glasses may have better outward appearances depending on the colors but as for the gold tint not good and would not recommend if you where truly wanting a gold mirror finish."
2.0,Way too big!! 😲
2.0,No a true 4x too short and too tight on the booty
2.0,Looks nice but the leather around the apron and the leather ties and neck crack and fall apart fast I would not recommend it or buy another one
2.0,This material is awful.  Not very forgiving.  Not flattering.
2.0,"Thought it would be rose gold on top and more burgundy/wine color on the bottom as pictured and stated. Otherwise, very good quality. Just wrong color."
2.0,"Well, I liked the idea of this, but it just didn't look right on me. My biggest complaint though, was that when I received them, the posts on the earrings were bent way out of shape and the posts on the huggers were bent too. Kind of disappointing. I tried bending them back a bit, but it was too much. For 30 dollars,  I kind of expect them to come not bent out of shape. It could have been the packaging it was shipped in, I don't know."
2.0,Will return zipper is stuck. Nice fit.
2.0,Tentlike in a bad way.  Returned.
2.0,Material low quality and odd cut
2.0,"The skeleton hands were printed super small, the shorts didn't have an angled cut so they were super boxy and just unflattering. I was disappointed."
2.0,like idk if ur into shirts with lace that comes up so high it goes to ur collar bone n scrunches in ur pits and then goes down so low it hits mid thigh but im tryna b a hoe so it aint for me<br /><br />also the material was mad cheap
2.0,"Regular paracser tan caro esperaba otra cosa el cierre es espantoso para abrochar tengo que gastar más dinero para comprar un cierre adecuado, en la foto se ve más grande más es"
2.0,I was disappointed with this ring. When I recieved it the metal felt rough not smooth (something I now will have to try to fix). It is very light and feels more like plastic. You can see on certain parts of the ring what looks like weld marks but is more likely from the mold it was in. Bummed cuz it looked cute. I haven't even worn it yet but hopefully I can make it wearable:/
2.0,"The heather gray pants ripped the first time they were washed.  The black and brown pairs, while flimsy, are a little better constructed"
2.0,"I’m a size 20, 40ddd and 5’3... ordered and 4xl!  Fit like a us lg/xl 14/16.  It’s a thin knit material.  Pretty color but way too tight!  It’s going back!"
2.0,This band is cheaply made it doesn’t hold up well I do not wear my watch everyday and am unable to because it is causing a rash on my wrist and very itchy from the metal parts on the band would not recommend
2.0,"I liked the print on the shirt ,but I didn't like the fabric and I thought maybe it would fit like it fit on the model but it did not and I was upset so I gave it away,it didn't even fit the person I gave it to like the model."
2.0,don’t buy
2.0,Small space
2.0,"These look really nice and are comfortable, but I received them 2 days ago, wore one pair yesterday and one today (it's 11am) and my toes have gone through a sock of each pair.  My nails are trimmed.  I do wear a size 9.5, so maybe they're just too small for my feet, although they seem to fit fine.  I'll give the others to a friend with smaller feet and will not purchase again."
2.0,I've had this band before but it was made better. This one broke a couple of times and now there's no way to fix it.<br />This isn't even the same band in the picture!!
2.0,I love the top of the dress. The size was as expected. I didn’t like that we got the wrong color.
2.0,no estira para nada casi ni me entra
2.0,"Got the size that was recommended, it's bot.the correct size at all."
2.0,"Really liked the belt, but it wasn't very durable. Went to tighten up the belt and the whole buckle fell apart."
2.0,Not the best quality 1wash and the stitching is coming out On the mask.
2.0,Lots of compartments. Can use it to store 6 cards easily. Strong money clip. Only major downside for me is the fact that the RFID blocking also blocks my transit/train card (I placed the card in the clear holder).
2.0,Nice summer dress but it a little too short I might have to wear it with a leggings
2.0,"It was nautical (a good thing) and fairly large, but it was very difficult to put up, as a matter of fact we never got it fully up, and would have returned it except we no longer had the box. It almost seemed like there wasn't enough fabric to pull the corners down to the sand, and the directions were not very helpful"
2.0,"I got these for my picky 8 year old. They were the only ones that I felt were think enough AND that he liked (the thinner the better for him). They washed well, good colors, straps were strong and adjustable, and they fit his smaller face well. Anyway, we loved these so much we ordered them again using the “buy again” feature. But the second batch that came was huge and wouldn’t stay on his face. Or mine.  The label on the bag was right so I don’t know what happened. Have not tried again."
2.0,"This dress is made of very flimsy cheap fabric, not at all as depicted on the photo. Mostly spandex - like underwear material. Very disappointing"
2.0,Easy to apply but didn't stay on my shoe the whole night.
2.0,"This device started out good and then after a month, it wouldn't charge any more."
2.0,Cute pins. One arrived broken and unable to be used.
2.0,"Loved the look of the dress but the cut is not made for tall people. The material is quite stretchy, which is nice for the fit itself, but the pleats don't fall as pictured, which was frustrating.  The bowtie is made of the same material as the dress so it does not go flat unless ironed, which is difficult because of the material.  Had to return it, which was sad because i liked the idea of this dress much more than the reality."
2.0,"This top is a nice fabric and fit except for the length. I am 5'9 and 145 pounds. The large was a perfect fit except very short and like a belly shirt. wish it came in tall, unfortunately i had to return it."
2.0,"So they are cute, and thin and not fleece or fleece lined. The wind and cold will cut right through these. I would keep them, but it's not what I'm looking for so I'm returning. I bought Two 2 packs. I may return one and keep the other for around the house or after school, but not what I was doing for."
2.0,"I still cant figure out what exactly is wrong with this top.  The bottoms are fine but the top...the straps in the back get all intertwined when you put it on.  You pull it down in the front and it goes up to your neck in the back and vice versa.  I got so tired of messing with it, I just threw it in a drawer. Maybe one day when I have a few hours to fidget with it, it will work out."
2.0,"I loved the way this dress looked in the picture but unfortunately, not as much in person. I am a size 4/6/S so I went with a small. It fits although it feels like I could have gone one size smaller maybe (although XS may have been too short - I'm 5'5 for reference).<br /><br />The dress came out of the package wrinkled so it needs to be ironed.  Once done, I put it on, and it looks a little loose. When you put the belt on, it improves the look but it doesn't look as sleek as the photo would suggest."
2.0,you get what you pay for. too limited on what you can use them for.
2.0,"Don’t buy this if you have a thicker lower half, it will fit you like a very awkward tank top. Not to bash the brand here, but it is definitely made for a slender frame."
2.0,"Size not accurate, smaller than expected."
2.0,"So bad quality, I just used it for one day, it’s broken between the medal and the hanging ring, dropped..... But I pretty sure it’s original version."
2.0,Not a good fit for someone with larger bust.
2.0,Very disappointed with the quality the design on the front comes off first use
2.0,"This isn't a bra, it's a swimsuit top. It's cute but not what I was expecting."
2.0,It was too big then I had make it smaller. When I tried to make it smaller the band broke so had to go buy another band and string it. Waste of money
2.0,"Wish I’d of read more on the reviews before spending as money on this set. The shorts are ok, but the top is definitely does not look anything like what’s advertised. It’s incredibly awkward. I am still a little optimistic that I might be able to work on it with my alteration skills."
2.0,Way too small!  I wore them one time and almost dropped the backing in my sink.  These earrings are much smaller than advertised.
2.0,"If you wear a size 14 in a shirt, do not buy this product at the size ...-14. Not true sizing. That being said. It looks like nice and relatively heavy sweat shirt jacket. Great style."
2.0,I love it but it was not green at all. It is more white in color.
2.0,Salio dañado el broche
2.0,"They were all super cute, but not great quality. My son’s pajamas split in the seam as he put them on"
2.0,Like that it keeps coming off my wrist 😕
2.0,Pretty but cheap crap. Fell apart instantly. Before I out it on. This is NOT steel. Working  on returning all pieces now.
2.0,"Sizes run small and they shrink a lot on washing.  Order at least a size larger than you think you wear, even after washing.  They are not pre-shrunk."
2.0,I had these pants for about a year. I LOVED LOVED LOVED THEM. They were a beautiful color and were wonderful to workout in from high intensity to yoga. I washed them accordingly and air dried them. Sadly after a year of only occasional use...they ripped in the worst spot..right in the V. Don’t waste your money.
2.0,It was not what I expected. I t was a waste of my money. I expected more.
2.0,Nice but u need a very little ear and they don't hold on good.dont recommend
2.0,Flakes. Does not work well. Lashes did not stick all day.
2.0,"Way TOO small, I'm a medium, and I ordered a large, and it was still too small, not happy at all. I most likely would have needed two sizes bigger. Plus, not the type of fabric I would have liked"
2.0,"It was too wide for jeans, not too &#34;pretty&#34; for skirt, I was not sure what it was for. Had to return it."
2.0,"Purchased the white leaf design. Super thin, seethru and very short. Cute print but definitely needs an inside lining for the cheap polyester fabric. Maybe it could be used as a coverup."
2.0,"I really liked the style but the fabric was not what I expected. It was shiny and at night it was actually sparkly! Very dark navy, which was OK but I just couldn't go the shiny fabric. I got a size Small and usually wear a 4 and it fit OK. I returned this jacket."
2.0,I really like loose fitting panties around the groin area. Tight elastic makes me feel like i can't breathe down there. These were tight; and i don't mean wrong size. Just tight elastic.
2.0,"Material thin and it looks plain.  Good for backyard barbecue, shopping and a potluck dinner .  Nothing special."
2.0,Very cute dress. Ordered a medium and it was way too short and small . Going to return it . The sizing is way too off .
2.0,Unrealistic appearance and doesn't stay well. Gets lost very easy and is not worth the price point.  I would recommend just getting the piercing if possible.
2.0,Came untied after about 3 weeks
2.0,"Quality of the product is low. You get what you pay for. The shirt is see through but I put a cami under to help. I would not call this shirt a tunic, it’s a shirt length. If you want tunic order the next size up. The most disappointing point of this shirt is the arms, they are cut very narrow."
2.0,"Strap broke within a week, but a nice product otherwise"
2.0,NOT for Petite people!!
2.0,Item came pre worn. Item was inside out as if it was returned from someone else who tried it on and took it off and threw it in a bag and it was sold to the next person which was me. With Coronavirus I'm not happy that I received an item someone else already tried on and possibly worn. I may just throw item in the trash.Not happy I wasted my money.
2.0,"While  this item does appear to be a lab created blue Opal it is tiny.  It’s on a delicate silver chain and  it is smaller than a dime. Bought as a birthday gift for an adult, I would recommend that it’s actual size be listed."
2.0,"I returned this. Kind of cheap looking, but was way long."
2.0,The bags are nice but they’re too small to<br />shop for groceries unless you’re getting a small amount.
2.0,I bought a small because that is what the size chart indicated would be right for me. The top was very big and the pants were tight in the waist. Not happy and will not buy again!
2.0,The hinge was loose but I tried it anyways because I have dealt this this before with other rings.  It fell out while I slept and is in the abyss now.  It was the right size and color though.
2.0,Don't like the material and the picture is dark.. it's was for a gift so not great.. returning product
2.0,Turned green in like a week and the rocks fall out in ur mouth
2.0,The quality of the fabric was not good and was too small.
2.0,"The long, long zipper was not designed right.  Looks funny in boots."
2.0,The earrings aren't that good. They broke in one day. The necklace is good.
2.0,Very pretty! Item was just as described but it tangles a quite a bit when wearing.
2.0,Fit good but colors faded quickly
2.0,The flower design was totaly different from the picture. if I returned I would have to pay $4  for returning item.
2.0,The concept of the shirt is to tighten up your bulging areas and make you look like you are in better shape.  But all this shirt does is make you bulges not giggle as much.
2.0,"For reference, I am 5'6"" and 128 pounds. The leg openings were a bit baggy. I am a 34B in bra size, and this suit did nothing to flatter any cleavage. Seems very cheaply made as well. Would not order again."
2.0,Be careful and size up a couple since it shrinks in the dryer.
2.0,It’s compatible with my MK Bradshaw 2 but it looks really cheap. Disappointed.
2.0,I ordered size S base on size chart and review but it way to big for me. I am chest 36 waist 26 and hip 36 but the dress still way to big
2.0,"I bought a large, but still too small and I don't have a big head either. it wasn't a waste though, because I gave it to my nephew."
2.0,I would size down. The blue in the picture is much darker than the blue I received.
2.0,A bit too snug for comfort. All around snug
2.0,"Mine fell apart :( I used it everyday for work and it barely lasted a few months. It’s not too professional looking and would be better for casual purposes. But if you need a cheap tote for weekend travel, it might be a good fit for you."
2.0,Smaller than what it says it is. BTW. I ordered 2 of these just in case they crapped out after a few months like my last one. One arrived already broken. Didn't expect much for $5 each and wasn't disappointed.
2.0,was not big enough for husbands calfs
2.0,Cute but after one hand wash and flat laying dry o can tell it won’t hold up well
2.0,"The pants I received don't really look anything like what's in the picture.  I like the Ponte style of pant but that is not what I got.  They are not tapered and just hang straight down in a very unflattering way.  The image shows the pants fitted near the ankle.  These are definitely more straight legged than tapered.<br /><br />I have another pair of Gloria Vanderbilt pants that I wore to death, so I was hopeful these would be my replacements.  They will definitely not.  The quality of these is questionable.  The material is very thin and there's no real structure to the pants.  Similar to what I'd expect buying something on Wish for $10.  Will be returning these."
2.0,"Ordered for a Florence and the machine concert.  It arrived on time but unfortunately was waaaay to small. I’m a large and this fits like a small.  Arms are really tight also. Just so you know, fabric is very thin. Great for summer."
2.0,The problem with this is that the size of the sunglasses is not written so I order it and the size of Lense is 58 so it’s big for my face and when I wear it it’s become lose
2.0,Never worked correctly. Watch could never keep correct time. Very disappointed
2.0,The fit was surprisingly good. I usually take medium size leggings. They were also nice and soft and warm. The disappointing part was that after just four times using them they started to pill. I didn't wash them yet. I have 3 older leggings which are pilling after many washes.over the years. I had to return them.
2.0,"Worked great for 2 weeks, then the buttons stopped working. The display was still showing & working, but you couldn’t switch modes/control it. Changed the battery just to see if that was going bad, and then it quit working altogether."
2.0,"I ordered this top in a large and a medium at the same time. The medium arrived first, it was too big. As a Prime member the return was free; I did not have to pay return postage. I received the large top later, and when I attempted to return it  the seller provided a label that  required me to pay return postage to China. I contacted the seller to request free return. The Seller offered to let me keep the top and give me $15 credit instead of the total price I paid. I accepted that. According to the UPS store, the return postage to China would be approximately $156. This was a learning experience for me.<br /><br />The top is cute and stylish, but it didn’t fit!"
2.0,"Really cute,  but cheaply made. My daughter dropped it in the bathroom and the glass shattered"
2.0,A fabric that will lint in the first wash. Also I order gray color they sand me khaki color.
2.0,"Pretty pictures but not so much in person. The necklace is heavy and hot. Because it is some type of acrylic, it sticks to your skin. I did like the size of it, but the material is not to my liking at all."
2.0,"Dress is adorable, but the size chart is WAY off. Its about 4 sizes smaller than marked."
2.0,Not the material I was expecting it was more of a shirt than a sweatshirt and it fit small had to return.
2.0,"Very pretty, but cheaply made."
2.0,I ordered my usual size but these shoes were too narrow and hurt to wear after awhile. Order a bigger size
2.0,does not look like the picture.  Looks very cheap.
2.0,"The leg holes were too big for me, although the rest of the item fit properly."
2.0,Very very short<br />Looks cheap and small.<br />The hats are small in my twins heads.<br />I will return these items.
2.0,This was advertised as a pendant. I have no idea who they thought could get it over their head. The string is so short I doubt it would fit over a newborns head. The black paint on the fishhook is also not neat and looks smudged. Very upset!
2.0,Looks like a medium for kids
2.0,"Be Careful, the back that holds the stud is enormous and they stick out a lot. I got them for 6 bucks, so they weren't too bad for the price. They look well built."
2.0,These are are not made very well
2.0,The photo showed a light colored Amethyst that I thought I was buying for a client… What we got was a very dark almost black colored “stone”. I work with gems alot and this was not the Amethyst I thought I bought.  I’d like to do more business with this company but I won’t be able to if I can’t trust that I’m getting the accurate gem that I see in the photo.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this jacket. I ordered a small in Navy and a medium in Khaki. To start, pulling them out of the bag they both smelled strongly. I can air it out I thought and pressed on. Next, the jacket is completely wrinkled from poor packaging. I can steam or iron it it’s fine, I think and press on. The khaki color is a bit reminiscent of diarrhea, but maybe it’s just the lighting so I continue. Then I spot a large black stain (photo doesn’t do it or the weird color justice). In hopes it was just bad luck I moved onto the second jacket. It had loose threads, the same odor, and seemed to have been scraped with strange lines in the fabric. The buttons on the navy one also had weird white lines which made them look old.<br /><br />I returned them immediately and will not be reordering."
2.0,"They’re soft but not very stretchy. I am 5’4 and 150 pounds, bought a large and could barely get them on. Although they seem to be made very well, they just aren’t what they’re supposed to be. Also, the colors are no where near as vibrant as the product picture (and I purchase clothing online rather frequently so I know there’s always some difference-these are a big difference.) The biggest issue I have with them, however, is the seam location in the middle. Idk about all you other ladies out there, buttttt I personally don’t feel comfortable walking around with that obvious line where it is. It draws too much attention to an area I wouldn’t want attention drawn to (under these circumstances at least hahaha.)"
2.0,"I read the reviews and thought I'd try these. I wear a 9 so I ordered a 9 and they arrived and they were huge. I put them back into the bag and exchanged them for an 8 which I haven't worn in decades. They arrived and they're huge too. I kept them because they're fairly comfortable, but they're huge."
2.0,"These don't irritate my ears, but they look cheap."
2.0,Cute...just too big for my liking.
2.0,The fit is kind of strange. I find the top park around the shoulders and chest very tight and then everything else is overly large in an unflattering way.
2.0,when I first got the earring I was so excited to try it on. the first time it didn't fit so i thought I wasn't putting it on right. On the second occasion I was diligently being patient with it and trying to pull my ear out of the cuff. it was impossible to put on. it's not fitting on my ear without it falling the next second.
2.0,"I really want to like this product, but I'm not happy with the fit. I have a 28&#34; waistline, so I bought the large and on the tightest hooks it could still be tighter, which leaves me with a useless product if I lose even a 1/8&#34; ... I knew I should've been a typical female and bought a size smaller than I figured I was!! haha ;) So with all that said, I normally wouldn't leave a review after only having a product for less than a week to give the product a fair chance, but sizing is pretty critical with a waist cincher. Noting the short length of ownership, thus far, it appears to be well-made. I will update my review, assuming it doesn't slide right off me in a couple weeks. Side note: Based on this experience, I'm starting to think one that laces up and ties may make more sense.<br /><br />Update: I had to return the product. It was way too loose, there was no benefit. I may get a smaller size some time, but this experience turned me off from it for now. If I do, it'll probably be for a lace up that can adjust to your changing shape."
2.0,"VERY SMALL, NO LONG AS SHOW."
2.0,"Just ‘ok’. I have a size 11 medium width foot & these just fit. If I had swollen feet, these prob wouldn’t fit. They are light weight & have good non slip bottoms. No better than the hospital slippers you get on admission."
2.0,Would’ve been great except that while i carefully removed the plastic the sticky part came off in some spots so now it doesn’t work.
2.0,"Straps aren't adjustable as a normal bra, there are 3 different levels they adjust to - if you need tighter or looser you're out of luck. The front closure to the bra is also unexpectedly long (too long)."
2.0,They’re fit small for be a large size
2.0,"I purchased this for my 2 year old grandson. The shirt is too small and the pants are big and baggy which is good because of the style, but he cannot pull the shirt over his head. Also, one of the black stirrups that hangs on the leg was detached. It was not sewn properly in the seam of the pants. I had to sew it in myself."
2.0,"The headbands are ok but I purchased them because they state in the Amazon listing that they are made of special material and UPF for sunblock.  I need these to cover scars on my ears and its very important that the material is indeed sunblock.  There is no marking on any of the packaging or the headbands themselves about being UPF.  Since they are quite lighweight, I'm concerned they are not.  There is no contact information listed here or on the packaging and no reviews or questions that mention the UPF rating.  I plan to return them."
2.0,"Masks were ordered for an eight year old, way too loose. Fell off his face. Too big for me(adult). They are soft to the touch."
2.0,"These earrings are flimsy. I was fiddling with one that was fully latched and on my ear, and the hinge split. This was after only a couple of weeks of wear."
2.0,"I have had these for 5 weeks, have worn 3 times and the stitching inside the left pocket is coming undone...of course, one week after the ""return by"" date passed."
2.0,So super small. Would mostly only fit in a babies or toddlers ears.
2.0,The shorts fit me great . I usually wear size xl but for the tighter fit I got a large . But the top didn’t fit me . Well it did it was just way shorter than I expected . Something I could wear to bed but not anywhere .
2.0,I wore the firm control garment for the first time on Saturday to a very important wedding in my family! To my horror there was no opening to use the bathroom in the garment! I didn’t find this out until I was in the ladies room!! I’m really puzzled as to how your company expected me to get the garment off and back on in the stall of a public bathroom! If I would have had scissors I would have made my own opening!! Very disappointed!!!
2.0,They looked very nice but tiny.  They were pricey for the size I actually got.  I did return with no problem.  Thanks.
2.0,"really baggy, not true size."
2.0,"It doesn't look nearly as nice as the picture shows, not worth more than $10."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Photo deceptive.
2.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful!!!! Didn’t fit me though,.. way to tight on my chest and I’m so sad!!!omg it’s so cute . I’m an XL and that’s the largest size...sigh"
2.0,"Not what I ordered. The picture looks like a fitted tank top. It's a very loose tank top, and it's short. Do not recommend for thin people with long torsos."
2.0,It came on gold and the picture looked silver. But still pretty
2.0,"Odd fit, too small even with ordering a size up. Clings in all the wrong places, I returned."
2.0,Not made very well...would not stay in place.  One end of the ear ring want bent...I trashed them :(
2.0,It looks so cute in the pic  but when I got it it doesn’t look the same the actually look like pajamas so that is what I use them for
2.0,"I like the cut of this dress, but it cannot be worn in public as the fabric is translucent. I had my son hold the dress up so I could capture the translucency and you can see his head and arm through the dress in this photo. You can even see the color of my neighbor's house through the black fabric of the dress. If this were made of a decent fabric, it would be wonderful. As tissue paper is more opaque than this fabric, it is unwearable."
2.0,"In the Q&A someone asked if the White skirt was sheer or  see-through and the answer was no because it was lined. This is incorrect. It is not lined and it is very see-through.  The quality isn’t anything to write home about, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,No support whatsoever and the fit is kinda large.
2.0,Is not what picture shows at all
2.0,They are pretty looking but was not how I expected them to be. They get loose.
2.0,"Cute but the rose is an ugly yellow, don't be fooled it is not cream.  The back of the pendant is not metal. The rose was not glued on right. It came late; not a good buy."
2.0,Was not happy about this I did not realize it was two pieces I was buying and it looks like a cartilage piercing but it turned out to be very very very cheap metal clip on it is cute but very very cheap I guess you get what you pay for
2.0,"Good material, sizing was a little off, but other than that, it would be a good purchase."
2.0,The material is very thin. Too big. Order size down.
2.0,Meh. Not cute.
2.0,The belt that came didn't look much like this at all.  It seems very thin.  Not what I really wanted.
2.0,I love these slippers. They're so cute and comfy but very cheap. I wore them a good 3 times and the top of it started ripping and foam was coming out of it. :(
2.0,Liked the look but could not zip it.
2.0,"I was looking for a comfortable and casual dress, but when this arrived it was just too big. I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs and usually wear a small or xs so I order the small. It fit like a large. It was huge in the arms and wasn't flattering on."
2.0,Very uncomfortable in the arches. Never had anything like that before. Unwearable.
2.0,It wasn’t easy to put in because of the metal or type of steel it is so it took longer then expected
2.0,Bigger than I was expecting but will make due
2.0,You have to have an awesome big boob and perfect curves body to fit this swim suit beautiful. I wear a size four and doesn't fit as well and I consider myself average body figure. Material is not well made but I guess can't ask for much base on price.
2.0,It's pretty but the blue strand snapped the first day my girlfriend was wearing it.
2.0,I’m typically a size 0-2. This was way too tight even in a size small. I couldn’t feel my legs when I tried it on. The look I adorable but the fit was terrible overall
2.0,I purchased this product in order to help keep the mask straps from rubbing against my son's ears. The headbands did not stretch as much as I expected so the fit was snug. I wouldn't recommend for children older than 5 because the fit will be tight.
2.0,Small in size but feels great
2.0,That glasses are fine fit great but the image shows a pink lens and it came with a silver/mirror lens. I ordered for the pink color. So not what I ordered but as a product they are nice.
2.0,Bien pero no es lo que esperaba su material
2.0,"Tons of storage, but feels like plastic."
2.0,Mine came already tarnished as if they'd already been worn. Will not be wearing these.
2.0,"so yeah, as everyone else has already said, these are insanely small. i'm 5'8&#34; and 110 pounds, got the XL and they don't cover my butt. lighter colors are also pretty much see through. not for the gym."
2.0,"Love the fabric but too tight. I ordered one size larger to avoid this problem, but too small."
2.0,"I didn’t mind the thinness, but I ordered a 18-24 month. My daughter is one usually wear 12 months, sometimes 18. The dress was very small and entirely too short to be a dress."
2.0,The picture looks great but once I got it and tried it on it was way to big. I will have to have it tailored to myself.
2.0,"Keep Hands warm, but the index finger and thumb on the right side does not work with the iPhone 6+ that I have. I am right handed, so this really doesn't do anything than a NORMAL GLOVE would do. Can't return because it is past the time, but didn't need to use until January 2, 2015 due to a &#34;warm winter&#34;. BUMMER - don't take a chance, if you buy, Try them immediately."
2.0,"The ties are decent quality for the price, but if you are ordering for a Harry Potter costume beware. The yellow tie is NOT HUFFLEPUFF COLORS. It is yellow and blue. I noticed after I received the set that the description does not say anything about Hogwarts school colors, though it is obviously sold to look like they are Hogwarts ties and they come up in searches for ties for Hogwarts or any of the houses."
2.0,It's really cute but fits very small and is poorly made. I washed it one time and the top piece the clasp broke off.
2.0,"The boots are very comfortable, I’ve had two pair. The only problem is the fabric that covers the heel protector tears off because it’s just glued in. That’s just the luck I’ve had with these. I will not buy anymore."
2.0,"they are rather heavy, what I really don't like  they do not match . coins are different.  postage too much to return but for  price  ok I guess"
2.0,"Bought an XL cause that's generally what fits me best. The first few weeks I wore these they were slightly snug but comfortable, however I've gained some mass in my chest and arms while going to the gym, and now the shirts are extremely uncomfortable to wear. Need constant adjusting and are super tight while not offering much room to stretch."
2.0,Them med fits more like a small waist so good for me my waist is small but it’s roomy enough for my hips and thighs . With that being said it has a mark on it and I can’t get intouch with the owner . I just steamed it (took a while) . I want this in black too .
2.0,"If you do not have a big neck or face, do not buy. They absolutely will not stay up past the first couple of wearings."
2.0,The look and style is great.  The fit for some reason is just right.  Thinking maybe it was just my fat head I let friends try them on.  Same result for some reason just a funny fit.
2.0,Super cute but within 5 minutes in my ears they were itching and hurting.
2.0,"If you are long waisted this is a really short jacket.  The sleeves are good length, but the cut is really short."
2.0,Due to the stitching in the crotch these are not leggings that girls can wear unless they go under a dress. When I got the leggings I was hoping my daughters could wear them with sweaters and such but the seam is very obvious and cannot be worn with anything shorter than a dress or very long sweater. Not only is the seam very obvious but the threads are all coming out after only a few wears. I wouldn't buy them again. They are very warm and fluffy on the inside if you are looking for something to go under dresses in the winter time.
2.0,Get what you pay for... they were so lightweight and un-durable that they arrived broken in the mail.
2.0,"Runs EXTREMELY SMALL.  So small, that it was almost impossible to get on"
2.0,"This shirt is made with heavy, stiff material.<br />Have not worn it yet because it’s summer and this material feels like it will be very hot.  Would not but again"
2.0,Falls off easily and breaks easily did not last long
2.0,"I liked this dress but it had many errors. First off I got the S-Grey color and in the picture it looks just grey. Well when I opened it, it had a blue material on the inside. Not grey like the picture. I had only tried on the dress to show my mom it once, and well I took it out again to look at it and it has snagged in a few areas which should’ve been impossible because I haven’t officially worn this dress and it has just been sitting in my suitcase. I’m super disappointed because I was planing on wearing it to a wedding but not anymore. I will not spend $40 on a dress that magically snags while sitting in a suit case, so I returned it."
2.0,One wash and it’s done
2.0,The picture shows a matching pair with one for the right ear and one for the left.  I received two that only fit the left ear.
2.0,Unless you have someone else dressing you this bracelet is impossible to put on and wear. The photos make it look good but I wasn't impressed with the look of it either.
2.0,"I ordered a size up and it was still too small. You may want to go two sizes up. Otherwise, the color was very pretty. Too bad it didn't fit."
2.0,This was a pretty purchase but I couldn’t wear it. Even on the longest setting I couldn’t secure it.
2.0,Runs very small. Cheap fabric.
2.0,Just didn’t quite sit right. I think it would be great on small people. Not great on my stomach area.
2.0,"It's cute, girly, easy to install and secure but I started noticing a lot of chipping around the 10th day of wearing.  I charge my Fitbit while I shower so it's not water damage. I just think even for 20 bucks I should be able to wear this thing without chipping after 10 days of wear. On my non-dominant hand at that. Was going to return it yet the original band that came with my Fitbit Versa was causing severe skin peeling, sores and itching so I had no choice but to go ahead and just keep this one. I didn't want to stop wearing my Fitbit during return and ordering another.  I will not buy another product from this manufacturer."
2.0,"its very annoying where the pinkie goes, looks like a hole was cut into the side as an afterthought and you are just supposed to stick your finger through it"
2.0,I did not like that they were advertised as compression and do not hold as such. Disappointing bc I bought two
2.0,I read all the reviews and it said it fit true to size...I ordered 3x and it fits more like xl...it's very short as well...if your a bigger girl this isn't the tank top for you if your bigger in the waist area (I'm 5'2 so when I say it's short it comes to top of my pants) ...I am disapointed I wanted this to fit
2.0,"The glasses came with one of the side panels missing,  the other panel was scratched."
2.0,"The symbol is too small, You cannot see it at all.  The picture showed 3 rings in 3 different colors. There is just one."
2.0,I was very disappointed when I tried this item on. I don't consider myself to be small breasted and yet the top was way too big in the breast area.
2.0,Close fit but came up to high and peaks over my tops
2.0,"We also own these, along with 6 other Livie & Luca's right now.  My 22 mo old daughter has normal to wide feet and these are too tight.  I have oiled the front, and stuffed a wooden egg in there to try and stretch them a bit.<br />All the others have been wonderful and comfortable."
2.0,I returned it because the pockets were right on my boobies
2.0,I bought these leggings for my daughter who is 8 because they said Girls.........not womens.  I bought a small.  They fit me and I am 37 and 125 pounds.  Not advertised appropriately
2.0,Runs 3 sizes small!
2.0,I had so much hope for these....only the black one worked. The other two colors had a pin that was too short so the band doesn't stay connected
2.0,Shirts are too small one pair of shorts are ripped.
2.0,These break very easily and don’t hold much fabric at all
2.0,The breast pads are too small for the top and it makes it look weird. I removed the pads and the look is better but there is no support. The knot thing in the front is odd and doesn't tie right. It looks cute until you put it on.
2.0,"I’m pretty sure I had a lapse in judgement when I bought this skirt. This is clearly meant for a 14 yo with no curves (that ain’t me). I ordered a large (which is generally my typical size in things like this) and it was comically too small. Pretty sure I’d need a 4-5xl to make this thing work. To say it runs small is an unbelievable understatement. That being said...the quality is actually quite good. So as long as you don’t have any curves and go up a size (or two), this would be great for anyone else."
2.0,"Ok, so the bag is decent. But it’s not as pictured. It’s two different pleather textures, the zipper pulls and hardware are completely different from the Amazon pictures, and the straps are made from cheesy seatbelt-like material. Disappointed. Don’t advertise one thing and send something that’s close but not the same product. Would have absolutely loved if the pictures weren’t deceiving, as the bag is an awesome size and would have been a great design with the pocket placement if it wasn’t so poorly advertised. I will say it seems like it’s made well other than that, like the straps will hold up, they’re just cheesy looking."
2.0,They fit small.
2.0,"I bought this for my 15 year old son for Christmas. After wearing it for a couple hours, the front pocket was already ripping off.<br />Thankfully I know how to sew."
2.0,Reasonably priced sunglasses but are too dark
2.0,Both bracelets broke within the first couple of weeks. They came undone at the knots. I was able to take some crazy glue and fix it for a few months.
2.0,"YES...THEY ARE EXTREEEMELY BEAUTIFUL!!! BUT, WHEN I GOT THEM, THEY WERE APART, AND I HAD TO PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER!!!! WHEN I WORE THEM...THEY CAME APART, AND I HAD TO PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER, AND TIGHTEN IT, SO THEY WOULDN'T COME APART...AGAIN!!!!"
2.0,What a strange boxy fit and too tight in the shoulders/upper arms. Returning. Really disappointed because Lands End is usually pretty great.
2.0,I bought this for my daughter for her 9th birthday. She isn’t hard on jewelry but within about 30 minutes of her wearing it the unicorn fell off. It isn’t super great quality but I figured it would last longer than that.
2.0,The fabric is not exactly what I had thought it would be.  I didn’t realize it was made in China.
2.0,"Hate the boob pads. It’s too big. I got an XL, and I have DDD and it’s no way supportive. I think if I even had a M it wouldn’t work since this fabric is in no way supportive."
2.0,I'm a 38D. I had high hopes it would fit me. Its very tight. It is cute however. I have big boobs though. And it just made them look small and sagged them way down. Maybe if you're an A cup you can fit this.
2.0,Does not wash well. Awkward gap by tie.
2.0,"It's easy to install, but the quality of the product is not the great"
2.0,"The actual product was much smaller than it appears in the photo,and actually was too small to even fit my daughter's ear at all.We tried for a long time but the tail kept popping off because it was too tight and uncomfortable"
2.0,Quality is wanting. It's basically from wish. Anything that comes with a tag that says 'Fashion jewelry' is basically worth 10 cents. It's pretty but kinda makes me sad
2.0,I was disappointed in the product.
2.0,Not Very comfortable honestly especially the arm. sleeves a bit too short and material is not that soft. Hurts the pits!
2.0,"The pendant is so small compared to the beautiful matching bracelet. The chain is short and it's not interchangable with a longer chain, without breaking the chain. Definitely not the $40+ value of the bracelet. Very disappointed."
2.0,Nice tights but didn't fit me. I can squeeze into them but there's like a weird tight seam where the opaque and see through part meet so it cut my thighs in half and made them look like sausages with string tied around them.
2.0,No me gusto porque viene corto y no abarca toda la cintura
2.0,"The quality on this top seemed fine, but it was TINY. The size chart for it when I purchased it was grossly inaccurate."
2.0,"Super cute, but already falling apart after a few uses."
2.0,Product was cheaply made and not quite as pictured. I returned it.
2.0,I returned this purse because it would not stand up. It had a wide flat bottom but one side was very bulky and it kept falling to one si9de.
2.0,light weight and massaging but low quality
2.0,I am a size 12. Ordered the L/XL and it's too small.
2.0,Very Cheap and Thin Would be cuter if it was a picture on the wall.
2.0,fit was weird and placement of the black seemed off. ended up returning it.
2.0,I dislike it because it’s Because it’s too small
2.0,I absolutely love this dress but unfortunately it came with a tiny hole in the front of it. 😢
2.0,They are super cute but definitely sheer when you bend over 😶 I use them for cardio but wouldn't dare wearing them to yoga or for leg day!
2.0,Im usually a small and both the top and bottom were too lose and baggy
2.0,"Larger than the size, bad fabric, looks ugly !"
2.0,It’s very thin. My son couldn’t wear the sweatshirt at all during the winter.
2.0,I received a pair of earrings instead of this charm. After back and forth emailing I was refunded for the item which I was happy about but it would have been easier if I just got the right item from the beginning.
2.0,I ordered about 5 inches longer than it recommended for the size of my pants. Luckily I did because it barely ones around.
2.0,"Smaller than expected, the hardware is not real metal. It's pewter painted to looks like metal.  One of the clasps for the long strap broke within days."
2.0,"Not a traditional sweatshirt material, photo is more flattering than actual item.  Extra large is equivalent to an American small to medium."
2.0,Boots barely lasted a month before the sole started coming off
2.0,"The color matches the photo and the fabric of the kimono is nice. My husband said it’s very comfortable to wear. I recommend ordering a size or two up if you order it. My husband is normally a L/XL and I ordered it in a size 2x which fits nicely to give it that flowy look. My biggest problem with this item is that it came with a couple holes in the stitching like the one pictured. I was very disappointed in that being that he hadn’t even worn it yet. This shows that it isn’t very high quality if it’s falling apart before it even arrives. Overall with the stitching and sizing, I’m not sure if it was a worth it purchase."
2.0,Son del mismo lado y uno de ellos siempre quedara al revés
2.0,"For me, these are not comfortable at all. The fabric is not soft and doesn't have much stretch. The waistband is stiff and doesn't stretch much, either. I haven't laundered them, yet. The fabric might soften after it's washed. There is absolutely no shape to these pants. I usually wear a large or size 14 in pants. The large in these is tighter than I like. I would advise to size up.  If you want something comfortable and figure flattering, these aren't it."
2.0,"Unfortunately, the breathing valve came out while hand washing the Mickey Mouse mask.  My daughter loved it before this happened.  I just wish she could have worn it more."
2.0,When I read a review saying buy a size bigger I was expecting the 3X to fit perfect. To my dismay it was still too small. I guess it's more incentive to move more. Lol 😒
2.0,I wore these slides to the pool. Slipped them off to swim and sun bathe.  When it was time to put them back on they had shrunk and no longer fit my feet. Weird!
2.0,"Very hard to loosen belt,Very poor design.Allmost worthless."
2.0,"very cute, but the first wash the balls came off. very dissapointed."
2.0,This hard to find blue leotard hardly fits my 55lb 5 year old ( she is almost 6 and on the taller side) yet the sizing states that it will fit up to 8 years old. I wish I had bought a size bigger. She has worn it for a few months and I already have to buy a bigger size as this one is about to be too small.
2.0,made in china size to small other than that nice socks
2.0,I loved everything about this band for the 10 days I had it before it fell apart. The woven part just slid it of the clasp. Thankfully I didn’t lose my watch.
2.0,This item runs about 2 sizes too small. It did not fit my husband.
2.0,Kid's Size. Should adjust the description.
2.0,Waaay too small to be an XL
2.0,"Nice colors, but very cheaply made. They were super tight and it seemed like they would break if I forced them open. I'm returning them."
2.0,"These are cute septum rings. Cheap quality. The gold one came with the hinge a little off so it's really hard to pop in. The black one functions normally, but I've never been able to get the silver one open. So like I said they are cheap quality but also inexpensive if you want to try your luck."
2.0,The actual clothing items are different from product pictures shown. The color is not that vibrant. The quality is less soft and comfy as pictures suggested.
2.0,"So small and the leather is not soft that when i put the buckle in the holes, it created creases right away."
2.0,I looked like a stiffed sausage!  Im a 10 and this was a NO’
2.0,waste of money.  no compression and i did get correct size. fits like a gym outfit and not an undergarment that will hold in the jiggles.
2.0,"I typically wear 18W, 1X, 2X, or XXL in women's US clothing sizes. This jacket in size XXL is too small for me. It is really tight in the arms and shoulders. The material is stiff, so it won't stretch to the size of my arms like most cardigans. The product profile description call this ""long sleeve."" The sleeves are midway between 3/4 and full length. Technically, I think they are still considered 3/4 length. The shoulders are padded, which I hate because my shoulders are already larger than average. The pockets are fake, which is pointless in my mind. The material is wrinkly, and it's obviously not supposed to be. With my busy life, I don't have time to iron clothes, so that's a problem for me. I do like the color, though."
2.0,I liked the design but you would have to be very fit or skinny to pull this off effectively. Any kind of skin roll hides parts of the design or makes the torso look strange.
2.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful. It was just too short. ):
2.0,Different colors and looks nothing like the shirt
2.0,Easily fall out. I've already lost mine.
2.0,"Didn't work even after swapping batteries etc, although there is a &#34;try me&#34; thing where you can test it out while still in the package; the shipper should have known it didn't work by trying it first like that. Bought another one and it worked, but the pin/chain broke off very easily like others have said (although this is doesn't affect its function).  I guess you just have to understand that these things are meant to be cheap costume accessories, not toys to play with for a long time."
2.0,I loved it until it came apart/faded on the second use (only wore it for two days)<br />:'(
2.0,I think these are made for hobbits or small childern.  They also are missing attachment points for PLCE rockets which is why I bought it.  Depending on your size and use it might work but note the stiching does not look all that great.  Suggest trying to find an actual surplus one.
2.0,Glenda Lalone
2.0,Do not wash this item. It tears easily.
2.0,I wrote a 5 star in the past because I really like the feel of the band.  But now I was trying to remove and I can not get it off to replace with a different color.  The band itself is still OK and has worn well.  I ripped it a bit trying to get it off so hoping that it does not continue to rip.  It should easily pull off.
2.0,"It worked great for the first week. After a week, the sound is not as loud as it was when I first got it."
2.0,135 lbs 5'8 way too big ordered a medium
2.0,Dress is nice but it looks used. Tag has been cut as if someone received the dress and cut the tag off.
2.0,This was way too small. The size chart doesn’t match the size I received and there isn’t any stretch so I sent one back and am keeping one in hopes that I can work out enough to be able to fit into it one day.
2.0,"It was 29 degrees here in Florissant, Co this AM and we went over to our property to watch our modular home be set on the foundation.  We had ordered two pair of these gloves and this AM we froze our hands off.  Don't believe that they will be good to -40.  A real big disappointment for the money."
2.0,"This thing looks cool, the first time you put it on, but it just comes apart. Not worth the money."
2.0,"They are very nice looking, but walking from one room to another they slipped off my feet. So i can't wear them for the intended use i bought them for."
2.0,"I have super tiny wrists and this watch is so tight, it’s almost painful"
2.0,The color is way darker than the picture and size running small. It smells weird as well. NOT WORTH the MONEY
2.0,"Oh, the smell. AWFUL. I bought these for a halloween costume for my daughter. I had to leave them outside for a week to air out and they still smelled horribly of plastic... for about a month after receiving them, i could smell them in our mudroom where i made her leave them! My daughter didn't complain when wearing them, although she wanted to turn the lights off for school but that wasn't an option. Cute idea and cute shoes while on but, y'all, the smell on them is no joke."
2.0,I usually wear a XL but ordered 2X.  Very tight in bust area. Have no choice but to keep it. The rest of the gown was fine.
2.0,"Good material, like the color, only problem is the neck hole is HUGE. It looks like a shawl hanging around my neck and goes down to where I have to wear a t-shirt beneath it, kind of defeating the purpose."
2.0,"The detail and ring itself were very minuscule. Purchased it to replace a favorite heftier smooth silver ring with a horse head with flowing mane,<br /> that I had lost."
2.0,"Cute dress and the fabric is nice.  But beware. . . runs EXTREMELY small. I ordered a medium.  I'm 5'3"" 140 with curves in all the right places and I should've ordered an XL.  Sending back for a bigger size."
2.0,All three arrived unbroken but I ordered a size 6 and they are much much smaller than that. I am unable to wear them even on my pinky because they are so small.
2.0,I loved this shirt and was so sad when it got here and I couldn't get it over my shoulders (size m). I have bought a lot of things from Allegra K and all the Mediums are generally good fits.  I gave this one to my very petite sister in law.
2.0,"Fabric smells bad. Almost like it's off gassing.... V cut is much higher than where most chests would be located, so it looks off."
2.0,Ordered an XL but it was tight all over. The skirt was above the knees and the sleeves were strange as well.
2.0,"Easy to break and not easily fixable, I was disappointed because I really like the product."
2.0,"Sure do look good unfortunately I think a byproduct of the curved design is a lense effect that blurs everything underwater. I've never had this problem with lenses which are flat directly in your line of vision. It's odd to me a manufacturer would either not realize this or not disclose this effect. It makes me wonder if someone with just the right prescription glasses would actually see clearly underwater as it's much the same effect as me, 20/16 vision, wearing prescription glasses....just vague, blurry shapes"
2.0,Kinda dislike this looks cheap made
2.0,"I ordered this because the description says ""barbellS"", implying that you get two. When it arrived I only got one. Very dissapointed. I have both my ears pierced, I wanted jewelry for both ears.  The one I did get was nice quality though."
2.0,They are sized very small. I have a medium small face and they looked like kids glasses on me.
2.0,Really..
2.0,"the color is accurate but thats about it. very poor fitting.i will return it. ordered an xl, not small."
2.0,Super thin and feels almost like paper.
2.0,"They fit my daughter and she likes them, but they’re honestly not that flattering, she’s going to keep them as pj pants.  No stretch."
2.0,Very thin and doesn't stay up
2.0,"Strap broke after a year.<br />I liked it because it was a light weight and it does not bother you if you wear it all the time. however, I haven't expected to break after a year."
2.0,"The color is lovely and the fit is nice.  However, the fabric was synthetic in the extreme, shiny and unpleasant to touch."
2.0,"Fits right everywhere, except in bust area, I'm a size 8/10 and a 36C, bought the Large size, it was ok, even a little bit loose, but the bust area seemed small, and barely covered half the bust."
2.0,Two rings broke right out of the package. At least it was cheap!
2.0,I love it but it is hard to get over my daughters head. She hates putting it on because it hurts her head.
2.0,My teachers said they liked it...Dont really know if this is a good thing..
2.0,"wanting to like the dress but gotta be honest that am not really happy w/ the purchase;<br />1. paid many dresses from amazon below 15 usd,  having better quality than this.<br />if see it in person would never buy it<br />2. ill fitting ,, fit true size (more like potatoes sack) on body but short,<br />if sizing up for the sake of the length then will look like a tent<br />3. fabrics is worst ever bought from amazon,<br />wish it is more like chiffon or at least nice on the skins, this one is itchy<br />remind me of uniform cheap fabric as well<br />4. no lining, even though it is black & seems thick, they are see through<br />not worth of 21+ usd<br />5. the bow ,, too heavy (must used lighter fabric for such purpose)<br /><br />the only nice thing is the flowers/embroidered<br />another dress to remind me only buying dress from amazon directly &<br />never fall for something that having high rating"
2.0,The arm whole is very big even if you're a large I'd suggest a small. I usually wear between a medium & large but the medium was too big. I plan on cutting the arm & sewing it smaller.
2.0,"After just a few days of wearing this ring it had scratches all over it and the ""engraved"" lettering lost it's color to where you couldn't see the ""True Love Waits"" on the ring. I had to take it to a jewelry store and pay as much as I did for the ring to have it re-engraved. The company would not stand behind the repair of this ring. A terrible company to do business with."
2.0,Band was broken! Been through so much just never had time to leave feedback but yeah the band was broke that little piece on the back that clicks it to attack to watch.
2.0,"Overall it is OK. The pendant is way smaller than I expected. The chain does not fit into the pendant, we had to squeeze it to fit!"
2.0,Ordered a large and it's more like a kids small. Label says large though and the graphic on front is very cheaply done. Wound up giving it away.
2.0,The material this is made out of is softer than others. This makes it seem less durable. It also seems to be a lower rise hat. I thought it would be a bit higher. I’m liking the Otto 5 panel better.
2.0,"The necklace arrived with one end of the chain disconnected, so the chain was in knots.  I bought this as a Christmas gift  and hopefully can connect the chain back together."
2.0,fits really small.
2.0,It's big lol
2.0,Fit as expected but the quality is not good cheap fabric not going to order again.
2.0,"These are cute and well made, but material is not at suede.  Also, although I bought an XL and the width was OK, the length was totally off.  The wrist strap was up across my palm just under my thumb, not at all close to my wrist."
2.0,"Really wanted to be able to wear these they are very cute.  As soon as I put them in my ears they started to burn, itch and turn red.  Description says the earrings are titanium, but I'm not sure the posts are.  Will give them to someone who can wear them.  Very disappointing."
2.0,Materials that the sleeves are nothing like the picture the boobs are way too small
2.0,I read the reviews and ordered an XL. I usually wear a dress size 16 because of my large chest and pants size 12. This dress does stretch but is still extremely too tight. I could barely get it on. It's definitely not for you if you have a large chest or even a slight belly. Will return soon.
2.0,"But umbrellas NEVER last long for me. I used this two or three times before it broke. Still, it's one of the better brands out there. I just don't think umbrellas are designed to last longer than a month."
2.0,"They’re cute but, out of 50 charms, 23 couldn’t be strung because the hole is partially covered."
2.0,was ugly and not flattering. I have a nice hour glass shape and this dress is bulky in spots. UGLY
2.0,it broke after using it a few times. the visor part detached from the frame. A waste of my money
2.0,"Nothing, cheap material"
2.0,Broke after a single wear.
2.0,Super Small Kids Glasses. Gave them away to a very small kid that i Know. Not<br />&#34;Junior&#34; Size kid at all
2.0,You need to beat least 6'5&#34; b/c they are SO long.
2.0,"Pretty. The cup size however, was too small! What a bummer. I'm not convinced going up one size  will help. If you're top heavy, beware."
2.0,Cute shoes I ordered a size 8 my daughters size and they were to big on her they fit like a size 10.
2.0,It's too different from what Chun thought<br />It smells like ink a lot...
2.0,Runs small. I ordered 2x because I like baggie hoodies ( I am an XL) it is so tight I can not wear comfortably
2.0,"First off, these shirts are very comfortable. They are the right length and fit. Unfortunately, you DO NOT get what your purchase. The pictures advertised are false, I’m assuming these are knockoffs of someone else’s designs. I have purchased 3 so far, I’m attaching pictures of each so you can see what I see. The first was close enough to the color and pattern that I didn’t bother saying anything. The second was not the same shade of light brown/tan that was pictured but instead a very dark brown, and the pattern is different, there aren’t all the thin lines throughout the pattern which is what drew me towards this pattern. But this third one I received is not even close. It’s not off a shade at all, it’s completely different. It’s not grey, it’s black. The strips are bold primary colors, not soft pastels. It is most definitely not a pattern or color I would’ve chosen. The soft colors is exactly what drew me to these patterns, I was not looking for dark and bold. 😐<br /><br />This being said, I contacted the seller and below is they’re exact response: “friend,sorry for that you do not like the cloth,but it is the right one,as you know the color will be a little different after photograph,so maybe something different contrast the photo.wish your understand.if you do not like the cloth you can send it back and we will return you all the money,sorry for that,wish your understand,any problem contact with us we will solve that for you,thank you“<br /><br />I’m sure you can see that there is no contrast in the picture or the photograph altering the shade at all. It’s completely different even though they say it’s the right one. I’m happy they’re willing to take y back as a return but the big issue is that they’re falsely selling specific colors/options.<br /><br />My main point is to show you that you aren’t going to get the color you want. It’s really unfortunate when you finally spend some money on yourself, choose something you like and it’s just a fake. So frustrating. ☹️"
2.0,Very small and dingy! I don’t like it and will be returning it.
2.0,"This is a comparison of 4 windbreakers / rain jackets I purchased recently on Amazon.  My goal was something I could use over a sweatshirt for running in the winter, but also with an eye to if I could wear it over a hoodie as a shell.<br /><br />Frogg Togs Ultra-Lite 2 Rain Jacket $14.99<br />5Oaks Mens Windproof Jacket Light Weight Windbreaker $20.99<br />Dooy Men's Cycline Bike Jersey/Packabe Raincoat $19.99<br />Outto Men's Lightweight Jacket Rain Resistant $16.99<br /><br />Common concerns:  Alright, whether they say ""men's"" or ""women's"", *everybody* seems<br />to have given up on men's zipper orientation - I would call everything a ""women's""<br />jacket because the zipper pull is on the left.  And they all seem to come with a<br />hood, I don't use the hoods but just having a collar does not seem to be an option.<br /><br />Dooey: This fabric is by far the flimsiest of the four, you can breath through it.<br />It may have a water-shedding coating, but I _do not_ feel it is adequate - even for<br />the ""wind-breaking"" ability, it is to porous.  The smallest and most packable, but<br />I would not get this product again.  You can see in my picture how transparent it is...<br /><br />5Oaks: This is actually the best, and is the one I would choose again.  Fairly<br />light fabric, but fundamentally blocks the wind and water.  Less ""papery"" than<br />some of the others.  Minimalist, elastic waist and cuffs; no hood-hider flap.  One<br />small shoulder pocket good enough for bluetooth headphones or car keys but not a<br />cell phone, it packs itself into this pocket about 4"" x 4"" x 1.5"".<br /><br />Outto: Runner up. Heavier (and crinklier) material, 2 inside pockets, 2 outside<br />zip pockets, and a sleeve picket. Adjustable waist elastic.  Velcro hood flap.<br />Much less ""packable"" than the 5Oaks (or the Dooey) both of which would be easy<br />to just keep in the bottom of a day pack, but more useful as a genera-purpose<br />jacket if you want, for example, pockets to put your hands or gloves in.<br /><br />Frogg Toggs: Honestly, in some ways, the worst of both worlds. The fabric reminds<br />me of a reusable grocery-store bag - not good in any way.  Bulky but not durable.<br />No waist elastic and no pockets at all.  Probably the best zipper of the bunch?<br />I would not buy this product again, either.  Maybe as a spare rain coat to have<br />in the closet because it is the cheapest?"
2.0,"2 out of 5 pairs of these socks had no elasticity. After wearing for a short while they would slip down my feet half way. This made for uncomfortable awkward walking!  Imagine thick socks bunching up under your feet. Like having twigs (not pebbles) stuck in your shoe!<br /><br />Too bad, they look nice otherwise."
2.0,My necklace came tangled and I am unable to untangle it. 😕
2.0,"Although this outfit looks totally adorable, it was not the size 4 it said it was. My 3 year old popped a button, and barely fit into the pants. He is not an above average 3 year old. Just remember to get 2 sizes bigger than you think you need."
2.0,"The necklace and 1 earring looked like a set, the other earring did not have a similar design In the  stone, so it didnt really look like it went in this set.."
2.0,They are like gauze they rip when you try to put them one and they try to roll off your hands.
2.0,The product was very thin. The style is very unique and soft but very thin material. Will need to wear leggings in the winter.
2.0,"Although CS quickly reimbursed half the cost, the item was a different color and weave than the picture. The sweater was tight knit with a banded bottom that came to my waist—and I’m only 5’2”. I called upon receiving item and they were gracious about giving me back half the money; or I could return it at my cost for full refund. I received a peach sweater, not pink like the photo."
2.0,Mask is good quality but a small fit.  It definitely does not fit like in the pic.  Probably fits a tiny adult or kid best
2.0,I ordered the bootcut and received straight legs. Pants nice however the bottom of the pants wont cover a pair of shoes.
2.0,Not true to size had to give it to my 12yr.old
2.0,Paint fade on the first day.
2.0,Standard size pins didn't fit. Had to drill out the plating in the holes and shave the width to fit watch. Looks like the raw watch band would fit before it went to the plating. Only had to remove plating thickness to make it work. Don't buy it if you don't have tools to work on it.
2.0,Smells more like chemicals then actual leather...
2.0,Very flimsy material?  Easy to roll up to pack but feels too cheap? sorry?
2.0,"The dress is pretty nice but the size is very off! It’s huge! I got size small and it fits like an XL. I am 5.6, 110 pounds and i usually wear size S. After reading the reviews I was hoping it would actually fit like an S but nope, it’s definitely an XL even though the tag says S."
2.0,Fits like it should be for a child & I have a smaller head.
2.0,Waist tie immediately unraveled and there was a hole in one of the pockets. Terribly sewn. I would caution against any color other than navy or black as they are extremely thin.
2.0,These were not seamless nor did they provide any shapewear. Unless muffin top was the end goal. Returned for  refund.
2.0,did not get rid of my glare
2.0,Thought they would be bigger... couldn’t get them in my holes.
2.0,The shirt is much cuter in the pictures then it is in person. It also smelled really bad when i took it out of the package like mildew or something. It was too tight and really itchy.
2.0,Cute but the size is all wrong. I ordered for a size 6 years old because my 4 year old is a taller but it didn't fit so I gave it to my friends petite 3 year old and it was too small for her too
2.0,"If you have big hips don't bother. it will cut on your sides. For reference I'm 5'7'', 150lbs and have an hourglass figure. I'm usually a large in bottoms but this one did not fit at all."
2.0,"The fist time I used them , the strap broke with only about 20lbs in it ."
2.0,Very pretty but hangs upside down due to all the weigh being in the top of the head. I have all three all do the same are they supposed to?
2.0,Didn’t fit tight
2.0,"The sizing is way off.  My baby is 6 months and I ordered the 3-9M size.  When I got it, the tag said 9M, and it's honestly big enough for my 2-year-old to wear.  I figured I would try to just wash it to shrink it instead of taking it back, but it hardly shrunk. I'm disappointed because these were supposed to be her Christmas jammies, but they are huge. If the sizing wasn't so weird, this would be really cute.  It seems well made and is very warm.  Maybe I'll try to turn it into a sweater for my toddler, haha...<br />*<br />***Update: On the plus side, this company had great customer service and upon reading my review sent me another pair free of charge in the size 70, 4-8M.  This was so nice of them, but unfortunately this size was still way too big on my baby.  She is 6M old and weighs about 16lbs, and she was still a bit swallowed up by it.  Also, I will have to note that the button holes were too small for the buttons, and I actually couldn't get it fully buttoned up. :/ I really wanted to like these jammies as they are so cute, and the company was so kind, but they just aren't going to work out."
2.0,The product I received did not match the picture and the item was way to small.
2.0,"I ordered a redshirt... I received an orange dress. I mean this shirt they sent me wasn't even in the same zip code as red. I looked like a big orange caution sign at best! The shirt was so long it went down passed my butt well into my thigh area. If the color wasn't off by so much, I would have kept it and worn it as a dress, because it was certainly NOT a shirt. I returned it. The size I did buy a larger size but I went only 1 size up that shouldn't have resulted in a shirt so long that it could be worn as a dress or night gown."
2.0,Cheap hoodie as you can see. It fits baggy at the end but if I would have got my boyfriend a large then the sleeves would have been too short. If he wasn't picky I would have returned this. Won't buy again.
2.0,The earrings were too small.
2.0,"Only lasted 1 week, then broke... Don't buy this Item as it not worth it.<br />It was a Christmas present for my elderly mother and she takes very good care of ANYTHING she owns!<br />She is very easy on her clothes and proud she can make a pair of shoes last over 20 years, if you know what I meen!"
2.0,"Typical for these off-brand sets, they cut the fabric to fit an XXL person, but use the same amount of waistband elastic as a Medium pair of pants. The top is almost large enough, but the fabric is really thick and clingy & not comfortable in warm weather at all. This one's going right in the Goodwill bin."
2.0,This legging is so elastic and stretchy. I wear size 0 and it fits me comfortably. The fur lining on the inside fights off the cold weather. Its not too thick but just right so that it doesn’t make my legs look any thicker. I stand 5”3 and my ankles are covered.<br /><br />Downside of this legging is that it falls off my waist as I walk or run. The waist is not tight enough to hug without falling down. Also it collects lint.
2.0,"Clear, light and comfortable AND broke at the right hinge inside two month with only moderate use. Sad..."
2.0,"I bought the red cover up. It was shorter than pictured and the deep V plunge neckline didn’t lay correctly over my cleavage. I would have been adjusting it constantly.<br /><br />I am a 34 G so I think the cut is better for someone with a smaller bust, like shown.<br /><br />Otherwise material was light and breezy and Decorative stitching looked good."
2.0,"Mask just does not fit. Not enough material to cover my big bell pepper American-African phenotype nose. I'm constantly trying to adjust which totally defeats the purpose, when you are not supposed to be touching your face. And it lacks support over the chin as well. Probably more suitable for a woman, or child. The adjustable tabs are off-putting, and do not add much support. The Filters are a nice touch, but will not cover both your nostrils and mouth at the same time. Recommend more material and that ""nose support type tab"" you'll find on other mask. Most likely made in China."
2.0,"I like the eyes, but it was to small i would suggest a size or two up"
2.0,It's fits well but it's spandex so it looks like a halloween costume.
2.0,"The item works as advertised but came WAY late.  It appears they they come in from China on a slow boat.  If you have lots of time to have these arrive then they are fine.  If not, look elsewhere."
2.0,"These are a nice pair of earring. However, the stones are not crystal."
2.0,"They do not fit, weird sizing. Returned."
2.0,"The stockings will not stay up on my daughter. They constantly fall down to the ankles. They’re cute, but they don’t work for us."
2.0,These look cheap; I mean they were cheap...but I don't wear them.
2.0,"made of thin, nylon- feel fabric, and that plus the lacy neck make this look suspiciously like a nightgown.  will never wear outside."
2.0,This looks great on the model but not so great on. It came very wrinkled.
2.0,"The butterfly kimono was very very nice and so were the pants and leg warmer things but the button up was so cheap and small, it didn’t fit. The belt was also very very small. Even though I bought an XL, the only thing that was made in an XL was the kimono. The hair clip was also a piece of cardboard and came broken."
2.0,They may be alright but I asked for a nine and they may actually be a six.
2.0,I liked this dress for church. I have bought many dress from Amazon and they have been the perfect fit. This is the only dress that was to tight at the waist. I am a fairly small lady so for it to not fit well hurt my feelings. 😢
2.0,I don't like the material and the color.  They look crass and cheap.  It is on my giveaway pile.
2.0,"Way too small, and the crappy plastic inserts make your boobs look like robot boobs. Discarded them immediately. But now I still have to wear a bra under."
2.0,had a funny fit to big in tubby an to tight in the leg
2.0,Not true color
2.0,Had these less than a month and there’s a hole in the seam. Thought this would have been great work pants but can’t wear with holes in it.
2.0,"They were fun to wear in a parade, and I got a lot of compliments on them. The problem is that the paint on the rims comes off--making it look as if I am battered and bruised."
2.0,"I ordered 2. A blue and a black, both same size. 2 totally different fits"
2.0,"Like the style and the fit.  The material is horrible.  It stains and the stains are persistent and almost unremovable.  If you sweat, don't buy this summer dress.  The pockets are also too small."
2.0,"I've an average-sized head and this is quite snug. It's not nearly as ""roomy"" as the (now, obviously, photoshopped) pictures would depict. If you've a smaller head, this will be great for you. It's well made and should work well for you - just was hoping for a better (more accurately depicted) fit. Unfortunately, I'll probably be sending it back."
2.0,"This top runs big, is made of a cheap looking polyester fabric, the neckline is totally unfinished (no seams). So it looks sloppy and poorly made."
2.0,"Large bag, fits a lot but it was just too big to carry. This would be a great bag for someone with a large family who wants to stack beach towels in here. Othewise it is easy to overpack and then it becomes extremely heavy. I ended up returning it."
2.0,"This may be my error by not checking the size, but the earins are too large.  I do love the style."
2.0,"Not just a little small, but at least a full size to small. My husband wears a 8.5 so I got him a 9. He could not come close to outing his foot in so he is wearing them as a slide in not a full shoe. I will not buy these again"
2.0,Bought this extra large and one wash the top is too small.  A one wear shirt.
2.0,Too tight. I like looser dresses. The length was perfect.
2.0,Unfortunately the chains design isn't good and it gets stuck in my wife's hair. Disappointing because overall it is great besides the chain. A better chain is going to cost probably as much as original necklace.
2.0,The color was awful.
2.0,Was disappointed. This hoodie was super soft and fit well. I wore it once for a few hours. The seams are coming undone and the white seam is coming though on the sleeve.
2.0,"maybe only for our daughter, but she will not put on mittens or gloves like this because she can't use her fingers. We got them for the snow but now we can't use them."
2.0,You get what you pay for sometimes
2.0,"These boots are way to tight at the ankle area. Very hard to slip on, once on they fit as expected, but if you have even a somewhat high arch these boots will be very hard to get on and off. Very disappointing. I have an older version of these boots the same size from American Rag and they are no problem to get on with getting them on. Maybe that is why they were so cheap. Not worth sending back."
2.0,"All of the socks were supposed to be mismatched,  but weren’t."
2.0,"This item runs about 2 sizes small. I am a size 8-10 I wear a 29-30 wasted pants and I ordered a large. It was way too small. All of the maxi skirts I have are a large and that's because I like them really loose. Also, the top does not &#34;fold over&#34;. Material was okay, size and quality just not there for me."
2.0,Material was not as described. Fit large. Expected to be over sized but I normally wear sm but would have ordered extra sm.
2.0,I was looking for something more form fitting.
2.0,This was nothing that I thought.  Quick shipped but so thin and not durable
2.0,"It was a beautiful wallet with nice texture and size,  but within a few months the edges were frayed!"
2.0,I have to roll up the sleeves just so it can look like it fits me!
2.0,Way bigger than ordered
2.0,It pills and looks worn right away.... it runs full
2.0,Lovely first look however it started changing color a few days after first wear which is ridiculous!
2.0,"This watch was beautifully packaged for a gift, but the final layer of plastic film around the watch itself was a real challenge to remove. The watch band is an attractive goldtone metal and the catch works like a belt<br />There is no second hand and, instead of numbers, the face is marked with individual metal lines (except where the 3 would go. The brand name is placed there). If you want to read the time, you have to move your wrist so the light does not bounce off and create a glare.<br />This is a pretty fashion accessory, but I would not choose it as my daily timepiece.<br />Update:<br />I set the correct time the day I got this watch. I checked 24 hours later and it was either slow by 45 minutes or it had stopped completely.  (without a second hand, it is hard to tell) I reset the watch and 2 hours later it appears to be working. Why did it stop initially? If a timepiece isn’t reliable, it has little value. I’m not sure I could recommend this except as a pretty bracelet."
2.0,I ordered two lanyards: multi-colored and blue. The blue one is more black; and the beads were not as big as expected.
2.0,The material is great and beautiful made just too small. I went a size up and still gave it away.
2.0,They didn’t lock in place like advertised. They sti fell off while my daughter was asleep.
2.0,Cool but really bad printing. The picture is really pixelated and not worth it.
2.0,They were not fitted and too short!
2.0,"Son really wanted a Hamilton hoodie. I found this and put it away for Christmas. It's okay, its very lightweight material, kind of silky feel. It definitely wouldn't be called a sweatshirt. Overall , its eh! He will have to wait till spring or summer to wear."
2.0,"Ok at first, 3 months later no as much - starting to shrink and texture is less nice. I would not buy again"
2.0,"Specifically requested package be shipped in Amazon packaging since it was a gift - it wasn’t & was clearly visible when my daughter got the mail, so that was a little disappointing. They’re cute, run a little small."
2.0,It looks nothing at all like it does on the model. At all. The v neck especially. Wouldn't buy if I had known.
2.0,It didn't look like the picture really cheap material. And it run small but I will try to wear it anyway
2.0,"Just a piece of material. Too thin for one layer on your mouth, not enough protection from covid. It's straight, so it doesn't sit on your shoulders like the picture. I do use them as a head band, wrap and around my neck instead of a scarf, not a total lose."
2.0,"A little shorter and thinner than I had hoped , feels like it will break very easily but overall it has a cute dainty look to it. It's great for a little girl too."
2.0,"This sun glass has very light metal frame with plastic lens .They are comfortable to wear and fits perfectly. The frames and lens both are very flat it comes with white protective pouch which looks durable. The negative side of this sun glass is very flimsy, delicate and arms are very thin and sharp. I wouldn’t buy this again."
2.0,Cheaply made smaller than expected
2.0,"I bought the size dress based off my measurements and had to have it altered because it was four sizes too big. The dress itself is very pretty, but I would recommend just buying your normal size based on your pant sizes."
2.0,Arrived on time -but not a quality hat and it was smashed flat by usps .. not sure if I can bring it back to life
2.0,Not as expected. I ordered sunglasses on metal frame and received plastic frames.
2.0,Underwears are made nicely and appear to have a smooth construction but but I put them on and lean forward the completely rolled down. I ended up just donating them because it would be very uncomfortable to have to keep pulling them up a million times a day.
2.0,"The earrings are beautiful but TOO HEAVY to even wear.  Seriously, way to heavy to feel safe or comfortable wearing them. For decorative use only. Would definitely NOT order again."
2.0,"I was not a huge fan of this dress. I sized up, but if I would’ve ordered my normal size, it would’ve been too small. I think it is super short. I am a teacher, and I would never be able to wear this to work. I also feel like the armpit holes are excessively large, so everyone can see inside at all times. It’s just a weird fit."
2.0,I had to return these because the bifocals worked well but the clarity of the other lenses were very distorted.
2.0,"Hard it had a string to hold it on , Not what I was looking for !"
2.0,No place to write a phone number. It’s not a zip tie - it’s just a weak clasp. I don’t trust it’ll stay on.
2.0,"The patch was received quickly and looks great. However, when I went to iron it on my son's jacket, along with another patch, I found that 3 of the 4 corners did not have adhesive to the edge. I tried more than five times to iron on the patch, but the corners remained loose. I finally used Liquid Stitch to attach the patch securely. Not sure if this was just a defective patch, but I would not order from this vendor again because of the aggravation, especially because the other patch worked so well in comparison."
2.0,muy bueno el negro es el ke no sirbe el amarillo perfecto
2.0,The product was sized correctly and soft.  The main issue is that it’s too thin to actually offer any benefits.
2.0,Shipping was fast. However there are only 107 beads on mine. Disappointed!
2.0,Really disappointed the one time I didn’t go by the reviews because I do LOVE this bracelet but the common reviews that the clasp is faulty is CORRECT it takes very little for it to come undone really really SAD because I really do love this thing but it’s hard to wear due to the clasp being faulty
2.0,Hoody is fine but the quality of the Ford sticker is very cheap.  Washed it inside out and as directed and iron on is already cracked :-(
2.0,The costume itself is very cute! But all my daughter did was try it on and the seams have completely unraveled along the bottom. She will still wear it for Halloween but it wouldn't make it through her playing dress up with it after the holiday.
2.0,Material was stiff and not the most comfortable and the fit was not as expected. Sleeves are wide and fabric does NOT drape like in the product image.
2.0,Beautiful necklace - but I dropped it once on the kitchen floor and the glass piece on the top broke off. So there is no way to put it on a chain.
2.0,Fits true to size. The material is very soft but the sleeves are an awkward length. The color of the pineapple on the shirt is more of a tan color rather than a pale yellow.
2.0,Reordered larger size hopefully fitd
2.0,I love the color but it is not what I expected. It is not soft or fluffy. I can feel the plastic or metal from the inside. I have a large head and it fits. You can adjust it but that part is not promising at all.<br />I gave it to my BFF and he have a big head. 🤣 He stated that he will try this at work because it's cold tonight. He'll try it with his hat and beanie. If all goes well he can keep this ($9.99) item that should have been much lesser. If not I'll be returning it.<br />I'll stick to my other fluffy earmuffs for now until I find a cool one for backup!<br />I'll come back with a later update.
2.0,Cheap junk. Dont buy it
2.0,Loose threads everwhere. Haven’t tried on yet. Looks like made at home with sewing machine
2.0,"This dress does not fit like it picture, it rides up even if you lift your arms a bit, the end of dress doesnt fall gracefully, the dress doesnt give you any shape. It fits a bit boxy"
2.0,Prefer black.
2.0,The material was cheap and had an odd fit when closed
2.0,I ordered these pants originally in a medium and they were too small. I reordered them in a large. When I received the new pair I found them to be the same size as the mediums. I even tried them on side by side to compare. There is no size tag inside the pants anywhere so maybe they just come in one size? I’m not sure but I was disappointed and will not be ordering again.<br />The fabric is made mostly of polyester so it feels more like workout material. No pockets.
2.0,"We have hard wood floors everywhere in our home and our daughter crawls nonstop, so I needed to find knee pads that she would not take off. These say socks on them and they do not stay up. I figured since my daughter has some thick thighs, they would stay put, but they slide right down. They’re too tight on her and make marks. You would think since their so tight that would help them stay up but they just don’t. It’s a bummer because they were not tight and stayed up, they would be perfect for our floors."
2.0,"Beautiful color but I got a small and it fit like a tarp. I didn't have time to get something else so I had to severely alter it, which cost more than the garment"
2.0,The lens size and temple length are quite small. More like a a child size. But to keep near the PC or something for in house wear it's ok at best. Would be a 5 star if they were made of better quality and larger.
2.0,Tornished fast.
2.0,The shirts are very short compared to most that i have ordered. They also ride up if you have a lot of movement.
2.0,So soft. Purchased this and it is already pilled up. Very dissatisfied.
2.0,MASSIVE SHRINKAGE
2.0,Material is not so good it looks fake
2.0,Pretty dress but very awkward fit. There is not enough material to be a wrap dress. I was exposed all over the place. Returned.
2.0,Wire came out of both bras i bought
2.0,The color is a expected. The fit is smaller
2.0,I’m a size medium and bought a large it’s still a little snug. Very cheaply made. I give two stars because the variety of colors is nice.
2.0,"This dress is not true to size. I ordered a small because I wear S/4-6. However, the dress was extremely tight in the bodice and I cant wear it. I won't order this brand again."
2.0,The pendant and the chain were very cheap looking. Ended up sending it back. Definitely not gift quality.
2.0,More than once the links separated.  They could stand a nice spot weld.
2.0,Product was made with ankle straps too short Nd kinda seem like cheap material
2.0,The product its self was nice. But I feel it runs 2 sizes small. I usually wear a 2x and this felt like putting on a regular large. Was very disappointed.
2.0,"Just ok, not worth much more."
2.0,The band around the back isn't elastic...so no stretch.<br /><br />The mask itself is hard with no padding.<br /><br />Buy something else.
2.0,"Very comfortable and soft, but not for activity and the color is gaudy. Though it is water and friction resistant, the khaki color is actually yellow and not cute as an outfit. Plus after just one day of wearing it the top button popped off. The back pockets are velcro. They would so much better as zippers"
2.0,"I usually wear a 34/32 but they were out so I bought a 34/34, the length was not the problem but the arena around the waste was very loose and did not feel like skinny or slim fit, also, the pants were alot lighter than seen on the picture, I got the light blues. I even tried to wash and dry them on high to shrink a little bit but no luck, but this is a sign of high quality pants."
2.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter for a school dance. It's a pretty dress, but not made very well. Seams did not align properly, and fabric did not feel as nice as a similar dress from another company. Navy blue color is beautiful, though. Sizing: Reviews said that it ran small, and it does. I ordered my daughter's usual size of small (she would wear a 4) and a medium at the same time. The small was too snug at the waist. The medium was a little loose around the middle, but would have been acceptable had the quality been there. I wish it had worked out for us."
2.0,I really like the material but is too snug .. I wouldn’t wear it outside unless I wore something over it.
2.0,Didn’t look like the picture look very cheap going to use them as house shoes
2.0,Not as long as I thought. Maybe it needs to hang up for awhile before I wear it.
2.0,These cleats were terribly uncomfortable. Ended up having to take my daughter to Dick’s to get a new pair. The back of the shoe rubbed her ankle so bad it caused bruising. There is absolutely no support in the sole of the shoe. She could feel the notches under the shoe through the sole. She said it felt like running barefoot on sharp rocks.
2.0,Loved the material but was too small.
2.0,I bought this for my trip to Miami over the summer and it broke within the 2-3 days I was there.
2.0,"The fit is decent and I may just be wearing them wrong but they don't feel comfy they're wide between the legs and they are definitely NOT panty liner friendly. It was like trying to balance a ball on a ball, it just slide right off. Try actually putting them on and your panty liner will fall right out of your pant leg while you're walking to work."
2.0,"I bought the size according to the size chart, but it was way too small. Bummer. Messed up my costume."
2.0,I am not sure if these are the same glasses as pictured.  Perhaps they were very clever with the angle the photographed them from.  They are actually polarized so we will use them.
2.0,The dye turned my daughters ear pink
2.0,I love Aria PJ's.  I bought two different sets for my 99 year old mother who is constantly cold.  One set fits fine- like the other Aria's she's had before.  This item is very tight in the jacket- fits like it was tailored and it's shorter in the arm length. Very disappointed.  My mother wears it but is very uncomfortable in it.  Not what I expected from this brand.
2.0,I purchased this at the beginning of November 2021. It’s been worn 3 times and it snapped leaving a treacherous mess to clean up.
2.0,"I'm not sure who makes up these sizes, but I would say that if you are bigger than a size 14 don't bother with this.  It looks fine and for what I paid for it I can't complain about the look of it.  I doubt I'd be able to wear it more than a couple of times though, so this is more for costume than wardrobe."
2.0,This skirt is very large. You definitely have to order a size or two down. That's what I did thanks to the reviews I read before I bought the skirt. Also the zipper broke when I was trying it on but I got a new zipper in place of the old one at the dry cleaners and now I actually like the skirt.
2.0,"Some of the socks are in a different size. The purple ones can't even go over my ankle. Get the pack with darker colors,  it was more consistent."
2.0,I bought these for a new hoop nose ring. Def not for your nose so they need to remove that from the description. Not bad for cartilage or ears
2.0,The fabric is so thin. Is not like the picture 😔
2.0,"It looks fine from far away but when you look close the material is blanket or pajama material. Soft, pajama like which makes it  kind of cheap looking  (like the soft blankets you get on overnight flights).<br />Next, the body part has a box shape and they did not do anything to the bottom, so it looks like you have thrown a blanket on top of a tight blouse and walked out of the house.<br />In addition, the color is way too dark. It looks more gray than green.<br /><br />I am thinking about returning.."
2.0,You have to curl your ties to keep them on when you walk. Results on foot cramps. I bought different slipped and these have become my backups when I can't find the others.
2.0,"Cute color and design, but these socks look worn after a couple washes."
2.0,Los pendientes enviados no tienen relación con los publicados son mucho más pequeños
2.0,"Very pretty colors but fits too small up tight. The material is soft and I love the pants, so I plan to wear as just pants with a long shirts and tuck the top part inside the pants."
2.0,"I loved the pattern, but it is see-through! Fit was so nice and I was sad to have to return them."
2.0,"Item info says sherpa. The only sherpa was in the hoodie and did not include the sleeves of the hoodie.  The pants are not sherpa.  I live in a fairly remote area and must do most shopping online.  Very disappointed in the quality of a much needed item because I live in a poorly insulated home.  I have to travel a good distance to return UPS items.  To say the least, I will have to such it up.  Unfortunately, I bought 3 sets!"
2.0,Not the same chain as pictured and I'm not sure chain is real silver.
2.0,"I was disappointed in the comfort of the fabric. It’s acrylic and nylon so maybe I should have known better, but I was expecting something lighter and softer. This textile has a plastic, heavy feel to it. It’s also sheer so fine for around the house depending on who you live with. The fit itself was great, I ordered small, my usual size. It’s a little itchy on the skin, not the worst ever, like something I’d put up with in a nice top. But certainly not something I want on my skin in a pajama set. It makes sense you can’t wash it hot or use the dryer, it would probably melt."
2.0,Color not as pictured
2.0,"Although this is a very pretty and intricate design, I resent the FACT that it is advertised as STERLING SILVER, which, it IS NOT. This bracelet began to lose it's color after about one week of wearing. This is to say, that I do not wear it every day, do not wash and/or shower with it. I wore it with outfits/other jewelry with which it went well. Thus, the total time of wearing it, is about a week, to give one an idea of the durability of the coating with which it is dipped or sprayed. The cuff that is the opening of the bracelet was the first to begin wearing down to reveal the metal color underneath. For $95, one has the right to expect that a product advertised as STERLING SILVER, is AT LEAST, plated silver, which it is not either. Save your $95 and put it towards a piece that you can be sure is what it is advertised to be. Sadly, after many years of shopping Amazon, I have recently been buying jewelry advertised as Sterling, the overwhelming majority, of which... is not. Buyer here, beware."
2.0,Broke within 1 minute of wearing
2.0,"I had purchased this protection plan, but I am not sure if the intended person to whom this gift was sent received the plan.<br />I certainly did not hear back from anyone about what had happened to this purchase."
2.0,"Would not ever pay $20 for this shirt again. The design is okay, but the shirt feels like bathing suit material. Very slick feeling and not good 😩"
2.0,Its cute but thin and cheap clothing material.
2.0,Poorly made. Falling a part.
2.0,Love the metal free
2.0,why must they make all bra shelf camis form fitting???  What happened to cotton ones that didn't reveal every bulge?
2.0,Prouduct materials are nice but one shoe is wider than the other and falls off.
2.0,Neck opening is sooooo small???
2.0,"These are pretty and lightweight earrings. I purchased a few pairs, but must warn buyers that these green ones are a very light mint color, not at all what the picture depicts. I wish I could return. Check the return policy if you’re unsure."
2.0,Not for the well endowed. Elastic isn't strong enough to keep everything secure. Nice to look at per the girlfriend though
2.0,Way too big for me.  I returned it.
2.0,I bought the only magnet septum’s they don’t really stick together the magnet is weak it’s not impossible to make it stick but it’s not the best and you have to fiddle around with it a bit and even then it’s not perfect but decent i guess
2.0,"Cute but material sucks. If you accidentally get a stain. No matter how many times you throw it in laundry and/or handwash, it wont go away."
2.0,Fabric clings to dog hair. If you own animals don't bother. Your breasts don't sit correctly.. I mean I'm beautiful so anything looks great on me ;) however it just was not the quality I was expecting. It is now being used as my dogs play blanket area.
2.0,Cute but cheap quality
2.0,"After being so pleased with the fit of the regular fit, I decided to try a racerback style. I was disappointed that this didn't have as much support."
2.0,"although my son liked these pants, both side pockets had holes in them.  When he put money (coins) in his pockets, they fell out on the floor.  Didn't keep the return information so I guess he will just have to wear them holey."
2.0,"cute, the necklace is very cheap looking.,"
2.0,"They're great, but there's an annoying speck between the tint on one of the lenses that's really bothering me"
2.0,Did not like anything about this top.Poor quality and horrible fit
2.0,Beautiful color. Well made. Way too small. Not slouchy at all.
2.0,Peplum came really flat and looks nothing like the picture.  I would not order again.
2.0,"The rubber bottoms are pretty thin and I do not get a sense they are secure around my feet, the cloth material is pretty thin looks much thicker in the picture."
2.0,DISAPPOINTED!!!
2.0,"A little too big, didn’t form fit well<br />I’ll use it if I have no others but I will have to figure out how to make it tighter so it doesn’t fall down on me"
2.0,Used these before w success but this time I can’t  get it to stay closed! Very disappointing. I doubt these are returnable as they’ve been in my ears!
2.0,Silky material and runs small. Band around the bottom is tight.
2.0,This top ran small and was short in length
2.0,I bought these for my daughter. She initially had a difficult time getting them on bc the hole to put her foot in was small. Once she got them on they seemed fine but she wore them twice and the seam btw the fabric and the sole ripped open.
2.0,"I wasn't impressed with the print and the smell emanating from the bag was enough for me not to bother, they were sent back."
2.0,Zipper is near impossible to operate.  Would not rec. buying.
2.0,I ordered the small and it is the exact same size as the large band that came with watch. Other than inaccurate sizing it looks to be well made.
2.0,The top runs really small
2.0,These do not actually have any lace on them.  The elastic on the legs is also very tight and not too comfortable.  Returned these.
2.0,"For $15.99 for a pack of 12 pairs I expected these to have the rubber grip on the heal part to keep from slipping. But these do not, within a few feet of walking these slipped right off the back of my foot. I put them back on and kept going and again, slipped right off. I haven't been wearing these for even 30mins and I'm switching them to cheap ones I bought at the shoe store that have the rubber grip. It's essential."
2.0,This watch band is cheap and not put together very well.
2.0,No era lo que yo pensaba estaban bonitos pero nada que ver los sise con lo que dicen en el artículo
2.0,Pretty earring but they turned green color in 2 uses and they r a lil heavy on the ear lobes
2.0,Earrings are very pretty. I like these a lot. Only problem is they can't be tightened so they fall off sometimes.
2.0,Looks great and the band material is good only issue is the stitching started coming undone after 3 days
2.0,I bought this strap in lavender to match my rose gold watch face. It's very pretty and genuine leather however I've had this band for less than two months and the strap dye is drastically faded. There are deep streaks across the band and most of the dye on the watch band straps has completely faded. I might get some leather dye and repaint the straps but I shouldn't have to do that. Fitbit was selling a strap for about $50 and in the future I'd be better off buying the real thing to avoid this embarrassing patchy look.
2.0,"The material was fine, soft and comfortable. The fit was decent on the belly, hip and thighs, but the length was too short for me. I'm about 5' 6&#34; and I ordered these in medium. The length stopped just before my ankle and I figured they would shrink, so I returned them."
2.0,"Sure, they're cheap. And the elastic pulls are a decent alternative to velcro, but less than three montha in, the insoles are already wearing through to the point that they're uncomfortable to wear. Sad, because the structure of the rest of the shoe seems okay."
2.0,"Not sure who’s bright idea to send sunglasses in unprotected  package vs box. Smooshed AND lenses are NOT polarized AND NOT gunmetal. For $11.99 ea I also bought Ronsou (didn’t have gunmetal) which arrived beautifully packaged with hard case, soft case and cleaning cloth-even better quality (3rd pic) and correct color-bought 3"
2.0,"I’m sorry but this sweater is very cheap looking and feeling.  Too bad, I was excited to get it."
2.0,the straps are removable and will not stay attached. I'm having to sew them on to prevent them from popping undone all the time
2.0,The chest is snug as expected especially for lifting weights.  The large size is very short.  I wear a med comfortable and thought a large would be longer.  I was wrong should upsize by two sizes for comfortable fit
2.0,"This product looks cheap, and it tangles so easily its near impossible to get onto your head. Its a waste of money. For the price it might be a fun add on to a Halloween or a Renaissance costume."
2.0,"When these Yoga Pants arrived, I was pleased that they were size Large.  Normally I wear size 14, so hoped these would fit even though they looked tiny.  I was hoping for ample stretch.  The pants material is a thick 80% Nylon and 20% Spandex.  They also have a nice feature of interesting shaped built-in pockets, so I thought, ""oh goody, these should be great"".  Well, not so!  No problem pulling them up on my legs, then......no more!  They resisted going any farther!  I managed to wrangle the pants a little way up my backside, but as soon as I let go, down they went!  I've heard of ladies having a muffin top, but apparently I have a muffin gut/butt!!!  So sad that the sizing is so off, because they obviously are very well made Yoga Pants. The stitching is well done, the crotch is reinforced, though the rise did seem rather short.  I have no idea if the Tummy Control actually works, or if they would stretch too much to show my underwear, (though they are very thick when not on).  As for bending over, or if the pants would reach up to my waist, we'll never know!  I was so hoping!"
2.0,These are mauve not light pink. Returned and got the white instead. They’re cute except the half circle only covers one side of the tassels.
2.0,too big. returned
2.0,"I bought the hype about them being for men or women. I have gotten readers from Amazon before and they were fine. I wanted some lightweight with extra magnification for some bead work. These were unusable. They were very large and fall off my nose when I look down. I have a large head for a woman so I haven't had this problem before. So beware, they are made for LARGE heads."
2.0,"Over priced, could be cheap for this quality of product!"
2.0,"Sizing was so off. The 0-3 month was just huge. My son is 5 months and finally fits in it.  The pants are soooo long.  Even at 5 months old, the pants are a little too long on him. Very cute though."
2.0,"As much as I liked how it's one whole blouse, it fit horribly. To begin, it was so loose that I could've sworn it was a large (but there was no size tag found anywhere). The sleeves were really big too, looked nothing like how it's fitting for the girl's arms in the picture. I tried to tuck in the blouse to see if it'd look better, but it just made me look frumpy from all the extra fabric left. In all, it just looked like I was wearing a blouse 2 or 3 sizes too big. On a positive note, the colors do compliment each other beautifully and the quality isn't that bad compared to the other products this company has."
2.0,Wore one time and ripped but was inexpensive so didn’t need more
2.0,The mouths are always at chin level which sucks. Otherwise they look and feel good.
2.0,verryyyyyyy narrow. not for wide feet
2.0,Strap broken almost immediately
2.0,"I bought this watch a couple years ago, and was wearing it regularly. After a couple months, the crystal had deep scratches, so apparently it is not sapphire glass. A few months later, the band started to tear at the hinges, eventually tearing completely through.<br /><br />If you want a watch to keep in a box and look at, good choice.<br />If you want a watch to wear, try Tissot."
2.0,"I got the largest size and it looked like a size small. If you're chubby or have boobs larger than probably a c cup, this won't work for you."
2.0,The picture on the shirt was very nice but I ordered a 3X and when it came the shirt said 3x but it was way to small to be 3x it matched up to a size large!
2.0,"I had high Hope's for this watch band. I ordered it June 25th, received it july 1st. The watch band is very comfortable, and looks great, but Today September 1st, a month after the return period ended the strap broke where the clasp is and then I noticed the quick remove lever was broken off.<br /><br />If only this was more durable it would have been the best watch band on Amazon, I really loved it until the day it broke. I havent been to the gym, or done anything else other than go to work, then back home to eat and sleep so I dont understand how this could break."
2.0,Was going to return but I forgot to get it to UPS before the time was up. Still sitting in the amazon box. Dress is pretty but the size runs very large. My daughter also complained of the sleeves being itchy. This could be solved with a long sleeve shirt. It just depends on the time of year and of course personal preference.
2.0,I normally wear a 38-40 D and I was excited about this product. The cups were sticky but it did not give the cleavage and especially had no lift to it.
2.0,"The lens are as good as I was hoping for.  Each pair comes with their own hard case, cleaning cloth and is nice.  Now to the reasons for the 2 stars, the frames are very uncomfortable.  I have worked and worked with them, but still have not got them to the point that they don't hurt.  And it is one of those things where your head is even sore after you taken them off.  I have been wearing the very cheap reading glasses from W-Mart and the frames fit well, but the lens are just not that good.  These are just the opposite.<br /><br />The reason for the 2 stars is because the lens can be a good as you want, but if you can' wear them for more than a minute or two they are of no use."
2.0,"This is my second one, thought the first break was my fault and coincidence. I just got my replacement today and it broke within the first wear. Super disappointed because it’s a nice coat! Warm and cute. But def not worth your time unless you’re okay with a defective zipper."
2.0,Ordered a size up just to be sure and somehow it is still far to small. Doesn’t even wrap around my waist fully.
2.0,The blue gems don't match.
2.0,Great bargain but does run a bit small.
2.0,Loved this belt until the buckle broke. Really nice and sturdy belt. By far my fav. So im so dissapointed it gave out on me. I wish they would make it better. My buckle fell apart in my hand while trying to put it on. The swivel that lets u reverse buckle has a small pin and it just broke.
2.0,They are tiny baby sized. Not what I was expecting from the title for women 😂 picture next to pencil eraser so you too can laugh
2.0,"I expected a smoother feel, like another silk-feel scarf that I own."
2.0,it never gave a size to order........ so these dont go up far enough for those of us with big calves.
2.0,"I love this hat, but didn't expect to see dye bleed through the seams and onto the fabric on top of the bill of the cap.  I don't wear this hat for golf, tennis, running, anything that would generate a ton of sweat and cause the moisture to bleed the dye, I just wear it around to protect a bald head from the sun.  I have other BC hats and this is the only one that has done this, which is bad since it's white and I wanted a clean look.  Oh well...."
2.0,tarnished within a few days of wear.
2.0,Was only able to use the buckle a few times until it broke. I really liked the buckle so I ordered another one. Hopefully the new one will have a stronger loop for the belt.
2.0,My daughter has had these in her school shoes for 2 weeks and the red metal tip that keeps the laces in the shoe has already broke off. So now I have to buy new ones after 2 weeks….
2.0,The chain on this necklace is not a good quality. It was twisted and hard to fix and continued to twist every time we touched it.
2.0,"Bought to go to the beach for a cover up however when I received it, it was made from sweater material which I found to be to hot in the sun. Good quality but didn't expect the fabric in sunny hot Florida."
2.0,They are loose and had a lot of stitching threads sticking out.
2.0,"This would've been so cute if it fit. I usually wear an XL so that's what I ordered, it was more like a M/L. Couldn't even button it up and the arms were so tight. Too bad, I really liked the material and style."
2.0,The &#34;silver tone&#34; has already showing wear and age.  The image inside the glass is off center too.
2.0,It’s not a bad band but there are other brands that sell packs of 3 for the same price and are just as good. Customer service kinda sucks. It cost me $9.99 but they only refunded me $5.99.
2.0,Too small not as pictured
2.0,These are WAY to long.  I wish I didn't need stilts to wear them.
2.0,Poor fit ...at least for my head
2.0,"PRETTY WATCH,BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.....DEAD BATTERY/NOT WORKING RIGHT OUT OF BOX, OH WELL"
2.0,Runs small and cheap fabric  button fell off
2.0,shoulder straps too long. waist runs large & hips ride up. bad fit
2.0,Makes my hands sweat & after taking them off leaves  my with a sticky feeling. I will continue to use them.
2.0,"These pajamas run so small & shrink drastically when washed. Plus the way they shrink when washed & dried, one arm is bigger than the other, seams have holes & threads fall out. Try ordering from a different company or save your money & go to Walmart."
2.0,Like the suit but the belt was missing.  I didn’t have a chance to get a replacement was just to busy. I will still use the suit but try to find a tie to offset the look.
2.0,Nice slippers with a good well made sole. The only issue is they are way too small. I take a size  9 1/2 - 10  shoe so I ordered the large. This is another purchase from China that will have to be donated.
2.0,The image of the Enterprise is almost too dark to be seen.
2.0,This items was beautiful! It ran incredibly small though.
2.0,"The fabric was not as soft as I expected it to be, and the arm holes were so tiny that it was tight on my arm pits. The top was also big compared to the bottom. Just overall not a comfortable or cute pajama option!"
2.0,They look nice the metal irritates my ears. Painful to wear unfortunately.
2.0,It fit well until it was washed a couple of times.
2.0,They were too big and kind of heavy! Not a good fit for our new walker. Ended up returning.
2.0,"But it's kinda hard to put em in after the first time you take em off, it's water proof but it will make your hand sweat and sthink anyway.<br />There are some others better and cheaper than this ones."
2.0,Ok wallet - so tiny. The red is NOT red. It is very pink. I am pretty disappointed in this purchase.
2.0,Unless you're buying it for a child<br /> Do not buy.
2.0,Very dissatisfied I bought these as a gift. They are labeled as Mens and womens. I ordered a medium for a man that wears american size 8.5 shoes. The pair that was definitely too small. So I ordered a size large to replace the gift with a pair that fit. But they are still small even though they are labeled as large.
2.0,They are see thru and not that warm.
2.0,I have ordered these before and each time one is broken
2.0,"These shipped quickly.  I did find them to be a bit small. If you plan on ordering, order up one size.  I was also disappointed that they are fading quickly in the wash."
2.0,Watch very nice; however battery was dead.
2.0,"Not as expected,The skirt looks very cheap, I bought a small and it was still little big .ends up returning it :(("
2.0,"For is ok, but seams are not straight. They cut inward instead of going down the sides of the shirt. Disappointed"
2.0,"I read reviews saying to size down, but DON'T!  Go true to size. And it was super short and I'm not a tall person. Quality was good, I just wish it would have worked."
2.0,I had very high hopes for this product! I got this dress in the white color and was very disappointed. Over all the dress was very stretch and very comfortable fabric! But the bra part of the dress stood out! The dress was see through.
2.0,"Totally see through, thin, and smaller than expected. Cute though"
2.0,The material is good but it runs small
2.0,"Earring doesn’t lay flat, came bent. Not as pictured"
2.0,Have only had this a couple months and have already lost a stone. I purchased 3 of the same size. This had to be forced on it was so small. Michael with Amazon is allowing a return for refund. Thank you Amazon.
2.0,"The backless piece looks so weird in this dress, not at all how it looks in this picture. Runs small so I would be aware of the sizing as well."
2.0,This bra is very thin feeling to me.  I don't feel like it offers full support.
2.0,"The shirt fits fine everywhere except through the shoulders where it is extremely tight. So thight that I couldn't button the top button, but could button the neck. I noticed that the image even has several buttons unfastened. I guess the model couldn't get it buttoned either."
2.0,"These are actually very cute necklaces but the image shows 8 necklaces and you only get 4. I paid less than $20, so not too bad for 4 necklaces, but you really should not pay the full price for these. Also, I did not get to pick which ones I got. They came in nice packaging, cute little boxes, which is the only reason they got two stars, not one."
2.0,"I do not recommend this top.  it feels more like a plastic tablecloth rather than fabric.  Also, it OFF WHITE not WHITE and the colors of the feathers are super tacky in person!!!  The photo makes it look awesome, but it's NOT"
2.0,Could barely get this wristwatch band to fit around my wrist...I'm a 6 foot 180 pound male who always has to take links out of the bands that come on new watches so my wrist size is not unusually large...This band seems to be sized for small wrists...The seller should say that instead of listing it as a one size fits all wristband...Very disappointing.
2.0,thought it would look golden not brassy.  Bought it as a gift.  Recipient<br />disliked the look. I agree. I hope it was returned
2.0,"Picture and description stated silver chain etc  it came with yellow gold color chain, I would not have purchased knowing the chain was yellow gold color"
2.0,The elastic kept squeezing and shifting..
2.0,"The socks are OK but only after 2 washes, a few of the socks started to get holes at the toe part where the seam is. I can still wear them but you can see little holes starting there at the Seams."
2.0,"I purchased this August 2018. The band is stiffer than the original.<br />Yesterday, after recharging my watch, I started to put the watch back on and the band broke.<br />It broke at one of the slots for fastening. I then noticed it was cracked where the band attaches to the<br />watch. Photo attached."
2.0,to loose in the leg...it does not hug the leg
2.0,Not worth the money. If you want a good bra to wear look for training bras. Cheaper and better quality. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,Two stones fell out now looks bad . Silver faded
2.0,This is cheaply made.  It deteriorated after a month.
2.0,The material isn’t  that I was expecting too thin and after the first wash is all wrinkly and isn’t easy to iron I’m very disappointed
2.0,The glue is poorly made they did not stick you can buy them cheaper over the counter at Target or Walmart
2.0,The cut out sides never stay even as pictured with the lacing and the button on mine fell out after only a few wears<br />They are very stretchy though
2.0,the cuffs are cheap but nice however the gag is hard plastic and does not appear to be body safe at all.
2.0,These fall off very easily compared to the other brand I bought. Also when I put my low cut shoes on the sock bunches up in the back.
2.0,"Lo necesitaba para un huawei band 5, y pensé que este le servía pero no son iguales. ☹️"
2.0,"It's a little bit too small for my taste and for what I wanted to use it for. But it's all good, I'll keep it for my car for keeping small amount of emergency clothing. Bought the next size up in this style which was way better and almost the same price too. They are made really nicely though."
2.0,They are too low cut.
2.0,I ordered the size I normally wear and this shirt definitely fit at least one size smaller.
2.0,"I liked this style a lot, but the frames were way to wide for my head. I am returning them today. I've ordered Quay in the past though and have been happy with them with a different pair of sunglasses that were more narrow."
2.0,I ordered the largest size to accomodate a cloth diaper. The romper is quite small and barely fits my 17 lb 6 mo old. The workmanship is low quality. I had to knot a few stiches that were unraveling and resew an unraveled seam prior to washing.
2.0,"This is way too small be be called a snood.  It's more like a skullcap or hairnet.  The quality of the materials and colors are good, but there's not enough fabric for a ""fall"" in the back to hold long hair."
2.0,"It's cute, but smells SO BAD. Seriously, the odor is horrible and I can't get it out."
2.0,Thought I would love it but not really what I wanted.
2.0,"I have been trying to loose weight for quite some time now, and for the most part I have had good results, its just a constant struggle but that’s ok, now, even thou I have lost dozens of pounds I am stiff far away from the body I would like to have, so every now and then I try to look for things that can give me that extra boost and help me look a little better while the process is still ongoing. With this in mind, I saw the possibility of getting this so called &#34;Body Shaper slimming compression shirt&#34; and I have to say that I’m deeply disappointed.<br />I ordered two of these, one was a XXL and the second one was an L, needles to say the first one was a little too big and it didn't do anything, but I thought it was because I ordered it a few sizes too big so I decided to get a size L, it was almost impossible to put it in because of how tight it is, but unfortunately, it does not help shaping on the stomach and waist area, I mean, it really does nothing for me, not even a little better.<br />I’m surprised I didn’t get any results because I did read the reviews and they said they had good results for the most part.<br />In any case, I don’t like them, I wont use them again.<br />The redeeming thing is that I was able to get them both at a discount in exchange for my honest review"
2.0,"I love this necklace, but the locket broke only within a few days of wearing it.  I've had to hot glue gun it shut a few times.  I was really disappointed."
2.0,"The shading gradient is really off on these, it feels a little like an optical illusion without much protection from the sun ."
2.0,I didn't like the quality of the fabric and the size is TOO small...
2.0,Poorly made and I was upset that it didn't look anything like the photo...
2.0,The piercings are very cute and good qualities but unfortunately the ones I was sent are WAY too short to be a septum piercing. More like lip piercings.
2.0,Front pocket zipper broke on the first day of travel. So I din’t think much of it.
2.0,"I bought this because I loved the style. When the gown arrived it was twice as big as I expected, and the sleeves were almost invisible. I did return it."
2.0,"So at first glance the shirt looks like the photo, correct color, stripes look right, cut looks correct. But the fabric feels like a cheap 80s carebear nightgown. There's a white lining inside, and the collar lays flat. It looks ok on me, except for the awkward way the collar sits, and the white lining showing on the sleeve cuffs when they're rolled up. She sleeves also don't stay rolled because of the flimsy fabric. I returned it because I don't really want to wear kids pajamas, even if it looked ok."
2.0,"Husband did not like these shorts, no fly front."
2.0,"Nice, light weight but they are designed so when you put them your hair gets stuck/pulled at the ears."
2.0,"The dress I received does not look like the same material as in the picture. The picture looks like and hangs like stretch cotton but the dress I received is not! Its very stiff and scratchy polyester which hangs, looks and feels very different than stretch cotton. Also the dress color is more dull that the dress color in the picture. I was glad it had a built in slip but since the dress is already heavier material it added to the heaviness. Very disappointed ):"
2.0,Already starting to come apart at the zipper on the messenger bag
2.0,"The sleeves of the sweater were tight and too short. I'm 5' 4"" and I ordered a large. Quite unsatisfied with the fit but the quality is good."
2.0,"It just didn’t look right on me, returned."
2.0,Started fraying after 2months.
2.0,This is SO cute but it doesn’t wear well. The necklace just doesnt lay right once it’s one. The mushrooms are so big they flip up and you can’t even tell what they are. Very heavy as well. I ended up taking it apart and making other jewelry out of it.
2.0,This sweatshirt is not good for the price. The material is that cheap shiney stuff on the outside and inside it has a thin sherpa lining. It's a very thin sweatshirt I was expecting it to be thicker as it says it's thick.  It smelled terribly chemically when I opened the bag it was in.  I ordered another one from Amazon bas*cs and that one was way better!  Not keeping this one.
2.0,Fabric is soft and tartan is decent but the pink is much more peach than pink. Has orange cast.
2.0,Hadley Roma the quality has dropped. Some years ago I bought the same one and the quality of the material was much better.
2.0,Not worth $20 we have blankets like this at work for $10. Very disapointed in this!
2.0,"The 2X fits like an American size Large. It's a beautiful dress and good quality, but please be aware that it runs super small."
2.0,"Gloves were fine, except for the fact when I tried to pull the zipper up it broke. Had to return."
2.0,Doesn't sit on the wrist like the photo and the smaller straps are fragile and move all over. Might work better if you are using multiple bracelets in order to keep this one in place.
2.0,"On the outside of the sock, the stripes look nice, but the threads fray out on the inside and ruin the look. It takes about 15 minutes per pair to trim the threads."
2.0,"It’s a crop top! Not at all what I thought I was getting. The material is nice tho and it does fit, just wish it was a T-shirt."
2.0,"Order 2 sizes up!!!<br />I should have read the reviews first, but assumed the sizes were correct since when you click size chart, it clearly shows the correct sizes.<br />I got these and couldn't zip the side up and thought to myself &#34;WOW I gained weight fast!&#34;. Then I read the label.<br />Make sure you order 2 sizes up! I think these are UK sizes.<br />They are nice other than that, it will just be a while before I can use them."
2.0,They were beautiful!!! But they did not hold up well and they broke and the bracelet and beads rolled all over the bar bathroom! Lasted till the end of the night though!
2.0,Runs very small. A wear a 6 and even worn at empire waist level it was so small. Returned
2.0,Left my fingers Green
2.0,They serve the purpose for which they are intended. They say that they are leather but the leather is so heavily treated that they feel like they could just as easily be some kind of faux leather plastic. Decidedly just okay.
2.0,Could barely get these things above my thighs. 38x32. Quality seems good but these things weren’t even close to “fits true to size”
2.0,"It was nice to receive a product that wasn't a weird material for once. The buttons on this dress are black, not brown as pictured and the shape is not even. It fit awkwardly around the bust."
2.0,"I wanted to love it. The fabric felt great, the color was pretty. And, it was roomier than I expected. But the armholes weren't just enormous, they created a weird, pointy look on either side of my breasts. Um, I'm already a DD, I don't need any more attention there. I don't mind if my sports bra shows, but this clearly wasn't designed for me. I wish I'd read the other reviews more carefully before I ordered."
2.0,Stones fell out on first wear.
2.0,"Really cute looking pants when you put them on. The design is pretty flattering as long as you are not moving. They are meant to be worn with the waist folded down (which again looks cute), but because the waist is extremely loose fitting and low, you will be showing your goods in the back. I had to unfold them to wear them. Even doing that, I wore them to a Zumba class and had to spend a lot of the time pulling them up. I washed them and wore them again on a trail run and had to spend most of the time holding them up. Very annoying. It appears others have the same issues with that. It's a shame, because they really are cute looking when you wear them."
2.0,You can see through it no matter what undergarments are worn and there is no built in bra area so you have to wear a bra. This was needed for a performance and it not built for anything but rehearsals where seeing a bra is not an issue.
2.0,"These were inexpensive compared to others I saw while browsing but now I wish I would’ve paid a little more for something better. Although they are quite comfortable, they dog up easily and become unwearable."
2.0,This colors in this necklace is actually ribbons. When you look at it on the picture you'd think it was beads of some sort.  Haven't decided how I'm going to incorporate it in my wardrobe because it doesn't look very nice with business clothing.
2.0,should have gone at least a size larger.
2.0,"Love this beautiful set, but the bracelet kept dropped when I wear that, the magnet on bracelet is not tight enough. This item consider defect product...."
2.0,"Fits ok but it is a faded black color, not a deep black color."
2.0,It doesn't fit or hang anything like it does in the photo. It is not the same product.
2.0,Cute but they sent the wrong color
2.0,"These are not the thick chains that I ordered.  The are thin, your typical necklace chains. I am not going to return them, because I am going to replace chains that came with other necklaces that I bought in the past, So they will serve other purposes, just not for what I actually ordered it for."
2.0,"This shirt is either way too small, or designed to be worn in a manner I never would"
2.0,returned - did not suit my purpose
2.0,"KIDAZON 3-PACK FACE MASKS | TEENS | AGES 8+ (Army Green, Blue & Lime Green Patterns)<br /><br />are more for a young adult I would say<br /><br />my 10 year old got these and they were to big for him and kept falling off of his little framed face"
2.0,the quality was fine but the sweater was too small. FYI a 3XL would be a Large in U.S. standards.
2.0,"This dress is cheap, so it is made of cheap materials. It was fraying at the top of the slit. Very thin. Not evening gown attire."
2.0,It's pretty but scratchy and catches on everything.
2.0,Not realistic at all color is off
2.0,"Love them, very thick warm and comfy. Only problem is that they are shorter than expected I’m not super tall but they come well above my ankle. Need high socks underneath"
2.0,Cute but Holds moisture and becomes wet feeling
2.0,The color was a bright royal blue.  I was expecting navy from the pictures.  It was a deal breaker
2.0,No me gustó la tela y la confección
2.0,I sent it back it was very tiny
2.0,Too small. Uncomfortable.
2.0,"It's cute, and it'll do for lounging around the house, but this is NOT a sweater. The material is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. I'm fine with lightweight sweaters, but I kinda thought this would be more cotton-y rather than ""let's go to the gym"" material.<br />Fit is very loose, and the collar in the pics does not exist."
2.0,3X is more like a medium t-shirt. Surprised it was so small.
2.0,Just
2.0,"I try to give all products the benefit of the doubt. That being said, what I've essentially purchased is a cute nightgown. It's thin,  flimsy and very cheaply made.. it is not ugly per se. However,  it does not have the shape of the dress that they advertise.  And if you have any curves, although it fits, it is not as flattering. The only reason I'm keeping it is because it would take too much hassle to send it back. So, f you want a decent nightgown that's kind of pretty, feel free to purchase it. If you want to wear it out like I do, you may be very disappointed. Please do not waste your time. And it does run small. Just an FYI. I never take a quadruple X in anything.  But if I hadn't paid attention to the other purchasers and bought it this big it wouldn't have fit. But sranglely, they did not increase the size of the breast area along with the dress. Which is kind of surprising since it has such a plunging neckline. It's a shame."
2.0,"I've had this belt for three weeks, and I liked it a lot. The magnets are strong, the belt is stylish, and it's more comfortable than a leather belt. I was thinking about getting another buckle with the bottle opener on it.<br /><br />This past week, however, the end of the belt started to fray near the end magnet. Now it is hard to pull through the buckle. If it has frayed this much in three weeks I worry how long it will last.<br /><br />If you do get this belt, watch the YouTube video on how to use it, it was very helpful.<br /><br />EDIT: I was contacted immediately after posting this review, and they have offered to replace the belt as it has a 1 year warrant, which I was unaware of. Hopefully it was just a defect."
2.0,I had no problem with the quality of the garment I loved it it was as it described in the description of the product and I would have loved to keep it but the seller sent me a medium so I returned it and requested that the seller send the correct size a extra small and I received the replacement in 2 days only problem was it was a medium again so I jus gave up and gave the product to a friend.
2.0,Not water proof!!!
2.0,"Definitely not a dress unless you are 5 feet tall. It’s more like a baggy tunic. Very disappointing, I donated it to a charity organization. Never worn. Don’t waste your money."
2.0,Dress is too large and sloppy. I normally wear a large 12/14 . This seems more Like an XXL
2.0,"This might be a good look for someone but not me. The ruffles at the waist ? That just nuts. Is there anyone out there who wants their waist to look bigger? The stars print looked silver in the pic on Amazon but they were gold. The quality and workmanship were not a problem but the style was. I returned the dress. BTW returns are so easy! So if you want to just try it, no problem."
2.0,Bought the large  Very tight on the chest
2.0,"This wallet holds many cards, however, there is no place to store coins and it started ripping after just 1 month! Now it is completely ripped, just for trying to open the wallet."
2.0,Sizing chart is made for tiny filipinos. According to the sizing chart I should wear a XXL. I could not get them half way up my thighs. Got stuck almost 1/2 way up my legs. These were made for Asians.
2.0,I loved it but threading came apart very early on and I was really bummed
2.0,"B bit disappointed in that the rose in the picture is a bright red, the same red as the beads, but when I received it, the rose is much darker red and does NOT match the beads. I will have to substitute this rose with another that I have so that the reds match."
2.0,"The fabric and design was nice, but 1 pant leg cut narrower than other so poor quality control especially shipped so far away only to have  to return. would have tried another pair if wasn't too late to make son's birthday."
2.0,"Was fine for what I needed it for ""BUT"" the pants have no belt loops! Thank god for duct tape."
2.0,"I was expecting to see smaller proportioned gloves but the gloves seem like normal adult width fingers, just shorter length fingers. it's very odd and way too big. I should've known little kids don't know how to wear gloves either, mittens would be better for warmth."
2.0,I bought these over a week ago for my Daith piercing and it is really pretty and fit really well. But now it has turned my ear green and made my ear very itchy
2.0,[[VIDEOID:1b1863b5963b4e60158c7e686e682c3d]] Was very disappointed that the color isn’t as vibrant as shown
2.0,I was really looking forward to getting this dress. I ordered what I thought was bright blue. What I got was much more than just a slight color variation. It's not even close to the color pictured. Returning it.
2.0,It does not fit true to size like the website says! I would definitely order a size bigger. It was still super cute and comfy though which is why I gave it two sizes. However....it ended up more like a crop top than a tunic! I will be returning.
2.0,The stone is a pretty color. In size very small and dainty. I thought the stone would have been bigger.
2.0,I loved the look of the shirt in the photo but in person you dont the 3D a big disappointment.
2.0,Cute but poor quality. Cannot zip after one wash and basically will never wear it again because I want to be able to zip it. No ability to return :(
2.0,I really wanted these to work. I read many reviews about how they stopped working on the first night and decided to gamble and bought it anyway. I pulled mine out of the box and one side of them was already not working. The side which did work looked really cool but I didn't want a half-working item. I turned them back on before I returned them to see if they magically began to work completely and by that time neither side was functioning unless I jiggled it around in which case it would flicker and come back on momentarily.
2.0,I usually wear a 1x or 2x....I got a 3x and it is too tight. Runs very small
2.0,"Received these today and there is a chip in the front of one of the lenses. I'm very disappointed, but for the price I assumed they wouldn't last me very long anyway (I seem to have bad luck with sunglasses). I'm going out of town tomorrow and need these for my vacation, so since they still work to block the sun, they'll have to do. Besides the broken lense they seem otherwise very good."
2.0,Really thin and big around the neckline. Love the design.
2.0,I would not buy these again..the material is extremely thin
2.0,The tank tops were shorter in length and much wider than they appear on the picture. Also the cut of the tank top is higher in the front than is showed on the picture.
2.0,Need to order larger size
2.0,The shape at the bottom doesn't look to good.  Poor quality
2.0,Had a scratch on it
2.0,"This band was soft, and looked good but would fall off all the time.  Not worth the risk of losing or breaking the watch."
2.0,"The earrings themselves are the perfect size and are beautiful however the backs are too large and don’t fit the earrings so as of now, they are unwearable.  I’m going to try to contact the company and see if they’ll send backs that actually match the earrings..."
2.0,Tight af get two sizes up
2.0,"I bought this same t-shirt before but a larger size.  Wanted a<br />smaller size and this surely is.  The larger same Brand shirt was<br />100% cotton.  Website says this one is also 100% cotton.  It is<br />not, it is polyester with no stretch whatsoever.  Disappointed<br />and I returned it."
2.0,Poor quality with a mini rhinestone in a random spot on the shirt.  Cheaply made and a definite return to Amazon.
2.0,Do not like the fabric and there’s no pockets.
2.0,Pretty shirt but definitely not sized correctly.  Delivery took longer than expected.
2.0,"Hello! I got this top and it  was ok for a while. It fits perfect for me and I was happy with this until I had to washed it. After the first hand wash, all the red part of the top began to decolouring and all the white parts looks like pink now. I'm wondering if this going to happen when I use it in the pool or the beach. I'm dissapointed!"
2.0,"It is a nice warm mask for walking outdoors, but fogs up your glasses indoors. The nose piece broke in half before it even needed to be washed!"
2.0,Lens Broke off easily.
2.0,Way more cropped than it looked in the photo and I'm 5'3 with a short torso. It fits like a sports bra. I friggin lovvveee that padding that it came with though. I took it out and swap it with other workout tops all the time haha I'd buy again just to have another set of those pads. Makes my boobs look great 👌
2.0,"It's okay.  I expected it to be longer.  I am 5'9, it doesn't go nearly as low as on the model ."
2.0,"I cannot stress this enough... SHORT. I am average height for a girl- 5'4"" and this hits my ankles. So disappointing. The material isn't all that great either. Kinda see-through. It doesn't have a good stretch to it. Which, if you are larger than a B cup... Good luck.<br />I would not recommend."
2.0,The chain broke after a week and made my neck turn green
2.0,Ripped at the seems within 10 minutes of having it on.
2.0,"It is very difficult to get both ends of a scarf through this.  Disappointed in it over all.  Was going to order silver too, but not now."
2.0,it was fit，but I dont like.
2.0,"Comfortable but the hooks on the cup will NOT stay hooked throughout the day. I expected more push up, very minimal padding."
2.0,even the XL is too small for me and I'm a size 12-14
2.0,"The Large were larger than normal and the medium were SO TIGHT!!! I always get the medium and these were painful to get on, I'm wondering if they were made by a different manufacturer. I have no fluctuated in size or wait. I've ordered iLoveSIA legging multiple times and have ALWAYS loved them, I ordered a large and a medium, based on lounge comfort, and slimming and work / casual. I'm probably not going to order from this link again..."
2.0,For tired feet
2.0,"I really wanted to like these pants. They look good, fit right. Unfortunately poor quality stitching. These pants did not survive an easy workout."
2.0,"two hours in and it has already lost a horn.  We explained that now they are &#34;cow&#34; slippers instead of &#34;bull&#34; slippers, to which my 4yo politely insists that cows often have horns too.  True.  The other horns are very loose, likely to fall off within the next couple of days.  Let's hope the sole stays on at least."
2.0,Returned item. The watch display was a bit too dim<br />for either of us.
2.0,Returned. Cheap quality and not actually a full skirt. Required an under layer.
2.0,I personally do not like this shirt. It reminds me of a nurse's top which would be super cute if I was a nurse.
2.0,"Cheap, which I expected. But I received two black and blues, no red. Also not stitched uniformly, so they have odd peaks."
2.0,"Cute, but the sides painfully dig into your belly button and I couldn’t have it in long."
2.0,The picture looked incredible. It looked very cheap in person. Wanted to gift it to my husband but wound up giving it to my son. Would not purchase again.
2.0,These totally fell apart. They are super cute but not worth the effort. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Based on other reviews for this belt, I thought it would be worth a try. In general, I like the idea of a belt that is not tied down to holes, but can be adjusted in much smaller increments. The packaging was impressive -- it was like unwrapping an iPhone. (Though, seriously, vendors -- can't you offer some kind of economy packaging if the item is not a gift? I would rather pay less and get simple packaging if I'm just ordering it for myself.) The belt itself was attractive to look at, and the ratcheting mechanism and the Linxx buckle quite ingenious. But adjustable up to a 54&#34; inch waist? I was quite disappointed to find that the leather strap itself, without the buckle installed was only 51.5&#34; inches long. I have a 48&#34;-waist belt, and I was hoping to move up to a 50&#34;-waist belt. This belt, however, with the buckle installed, was shorter than my existing 48&#34;-waist belt. It would be a great belt for someone with a smaller waist. But if you are truly hoping for something adjustable up to a 54&#34; waist, you will be disappointed. My requests to the vendor for clarification on the belt length went unanswered. I will have to look elsewhere for a 50&#34; waist belt, as this one simply is not as long as advertised."
2.0,The button holes stretched out after just one wearing
2.0,I gave these pants a 5-star rating at first but the 2nd time i wore them i knelt down to pick up my great nephew and the pants split from the knee to the front pocket.Right along the seam where the lower pocket was sewn on the front. They are supposed to be RIPSTOP material but that's not accurate at all. the longer i wore them the longer the split became. You cant even sew them because the material spreads out and forms a new rip. I'm never going to buy pants from overseas again. Going through Customs to return them is such a hassle i will throw them away just like my $31.95.
2.0,"Hoped to like this but the snap on the breast was in the wrong place.  I could have moved it on but frankly it looked like scrubs. I tried to dress it up with colorful, chunky jewelry but we decided it wasn’t a keeper.  Offered it to my daughter but no better on her and on her everything looks cute. Returned very easily with amazon returns."
2.0,"This is a pretty bracelet, but gems had fallen off before I even took it out of the package. Took it out to try it on and even more came off...returning."
2.0,"This dress is really cute but it is way too small and super shear. I didn't return it, hoping someone else that is smaller than me can wear it."
2.0,Material is very soft but too clingy.  More like lite weight sweater material than nightgown.
2.0,"I have used it for a week, the zipper broke. The chemical smell is so strong! Wouldn’t recommend"
2.0,"I noticed right away when I took this out of the package that it was suuuuper see through. In the picture I uploaded, that’s someone’s red car across the street.<br />I did like the print, and the fabric was soft, so I still tried it on. Figured I could wear nude undergarments if I liked it. Dress was way too wide on me though and the sleeves came down to the end of my pinky.<br />Will be returning."
2.0,"The short runs about 4 size small. I order a XXL, and where American medium.  The material quality was better then expect but unfortunately, I cannot button up the short due to ill fitting size."
2.0,Doesn't really fit to size
2.0,"It feels super cheap. The texture of whatever coating they used is just bleh. Also theyre way smaller than I thought. Not the guage, but the ring size in general."
2.0,Short but wide for some reason
2.0,I read the reviews about it being Chinese scaled sizes so I got thr biggest size I could and it's waaaay t small.  This thing looks like a xs small .  I got a 3x.  This isn't 2 sizes too small its like 4 sizes too small.  If my teen daughter wants it I'll let her have it.  If you need sonething cute for your stuffed teddy bear this shirt would be great.  But uf your teddy is a small make sure you get the shirt in xl
2.0,It is too tight and the under skirt likes to ride up. This was a waste of money.
2.0,"Yes, it looks good."
2.0,We ordered the hat and scarf set in new candy pink as well as a set of their kids gloves in new candy pink. They just arrived and they are all labeled as “new candy pink” but are different shades of pink. Very disappointed.
2.0,I have the deep teal color in a small. The color is beautiful however mine came with thread coming apart in the thigh . So I was definitely disappointed when i go to wear a new purchase and it is falling apart and I have been showing people and I feel embarrassed if this is how others are as well.<br />Definitely check those seams!
2.0,I bought this for my sunglasses and because this would not fit any of my sunglass ears i settled for my reading glasses which have narrow ears. .Not really happy.
2.0,"I ordered the 2XL, and when I took it out of the package I had to check the tag because I thought it was a small! Return! I also didn’t expect it to be ribbed."
2.0,one shoe does not stay connected during charge
2.0,I really loved the dress but had to return it because it was a foot too long even with heels on. Wish I had the money to alter it but had to return it
2.0,"Not super impressed. Fresh out of the case, tried cleaning the lense and it popped right out on the floor.  I know they're 10 dollar sunglasses, but have bought other cheap brands that were more stout than these. Not super upset, you win some you lose some.  But also probably won't buy any other pairs like this."
2.0,Nice and thin but runs super small.
2.0,these earrings are slightly bigger then i imagined but still pretty. 2 stars because the are cheaply made and a stone feel out of one of my earrings just from taking it off the papper... i few other stones are wiggly and probably going to fall out when i go to sleep tonight but you get what you pay for.. not very happy..wouldnt buy again...
2.0,"This isn't a lose fit fabric but rather one that sucks to your body, great if you are skinny, but if you have any meat on your bones then you probally wont like the look"
2.0,"Cute, perfect size but showed up broken. Kept the stud but had to order other posts the same size."
2.0,Definitely not the size I needed but made it work
2.0,Good style but heavy for not even being glass lenses.
2.0,I'm a size 10 usually and occasionally 12. The size xl was too big so that may be the cause of the unflattering fit! It sort of looks like the cut of a toddler dress made in a bigger size! There is no accentuating the waist even with belt tied! The lace and color are beautiful so I wish it had worked for me!
2.0,Did not like the size and the appreance  once I got it
2.0,"Looks better in person than the photo, only problem is it doesn't fir perfectly and the clasp in non adjustable, can remove links which is nice, the customer support has been kind but not very helpful."
2.0,"Ordered several of these..and loved them all...EXCEPT this one. Came in an old beat up bag, which was an obvious return from someone else. Pants are ridiculously long..and obviously worn. So disappointed!"
2.0,Very stretchy. Boobs pop out the bottom
2.0,I ordered 3 sizes larger and it's still too small.
2.0,These fell apart after only a few months.  I bought these because I liked the last Dearfoams I purchased (which I have been unable to find again) that were much more robust and lasted a longer time than these. I wear these around the house but will step outside from time to time.
2.0,"This cap is too small in general, it will expand to fit any size head, but the cap structure it self only expands to about 7 1/4, any thing bigger than that and the strap in back bulges out and looks stupid.  Material and build seems good, this cap is just not big enough for anyone that has a cap size larger 7-7.25.. i would expect it will fit women and youth great."
2.0,This was not plus sized by any means....they need to have better size chart info.
2.0,I like the way they fit in size but not around my calve...they are way too large 😩
2.0,Not a tunic top. It’s short and smaller than expected.
2.0,It Definatly does not fit like in the image. It is not this long and it’s very thin and see thru.
2.0,Glasses are a smaller then the size stated and are not returnable.  Very disappointed!!
2.0,I’ve worn this around 6 times. It’s very thin and the stitching is coming out. It’s cute but not worth the money. This is a 10$ coat
2.0,I believe this had came in the color that was in the photo the image of the head that is but because of either cheating or contrast it appeared to be a different color than what it is it really sucks
2.0,"Function is ok, but color is a bit off."
2.0,"Looked very cheap at the seams, zipper and straps"
2.0,Got this to use while working in the yard.  The band extends too far beyond the edges where it clips in and the cover is too sloppy and makes it hard to access the controls or swipe on face of the watch.
2.0,"Flygo snipped the original manufacture’s label...leaving behind a sliver, indicating poor professionalism. In USA, only the consumer has the legal right to remove labels.<br />The product quality was also not up to the mark...poor quality zipper does not operate smoothly."
2.0,product smaller than expected and the stitching is falling apart where the buttons are
2.0,bands are not very high quality and they are too small. I have a small wrist and they do not fit me
2.0,I bought this dress and when I tried it on it wouldn't fit over my chest. I even ordered a size up. I couldn't get it zipped. It was even tight around the hips and butt. Even the little droopy sleeves were tight when you put your arms through them. The pattern is nice and it looks well made it's just far too small.
2.0,not true to size too small
2.0,"Was cute, the color turn from gold to silver very quickly though"
2.0,The boots appearance was as expected and good quality .
2.0,"Where is the other dangle drop? There is only one drop on my pair. I thought this was odd, and after viewing other customer photos, I am quite dissatisfied with these earrings."
2.0,"I bought this set a Father's Day gift for my husband. Nice packaging and products look great. However, the keyring brought within a week  of my husband using it. That is very disappointing as he really loved it."
2.0,Not as advertised. Regular fit but advertised as slim fit
2.0,"The good:  It looks good, functions ok (sometimes slow with touch), pairs with zwave network fine, and the illuminated buttons are a modern accent.<br /><br />The bad: The pictures are misleading.  The switch cannot be oriented horizontally.  This is not a 2 gang switch but a 2 channel, 1 gang switch that must be oriented vertically.  Most junction boxes with two switches are side by side (2 gang), not on top of each other (1 gang).  In most houses, 1 gang boxes hold 1 switch, not 2 switches.  The bracket that affixes to the switch junction box does not make room for the screw terminals that contain the wires.  It goes on and off just fine until you wire the switch up then it has trouble.  Push too hard and the glass switch panel will break.  Ask me how I know...  Finally, you can't use it with a 3 way switch setup.  If you have two switches on either side of a room for 1 light, you can't use this switch.  It has only room for 1 hot, 1 neutral, and 2 seperate loads and there is no terminal for a traveler wire.  The only use case for this switch is a small bedroom that has only one switch to turn on a light and another switch on top of it to turn on a fan.  This means you can't outfit your house with these since they won't work in the majority of places you need them to."
2.0,Demasiado ancha
2.0,"I bought these for my husband to clean the leaves out of our pool with a long pole and net.  I bought a XL and he couldn't get his hands in the gloves.  I had to fight them to get my hands in them but once on, they fit me (female). My hands stayed warm but from just using the pool pole with net, the gloves and my hands were soaking wet.  It took about 2 days for them to dry out on their own."
2.0,"It looked pretty and seemed of good quality, but the clasp was too hard for me to open and close; I broke my fingernail opening it. Returned it."
2.0,"This was ordered for a gift so I cannot rate absorbency. It is extremely light weight and looks like a cheap knock-off so I would ordinarily return it, considering the cost, but not enough time to replace it."
2.0,Eyelashes still hit material. Needs more room.
2.0,"Within four washings, the maroon bled onto the aTm making it pink.  Also the fabric started to bead up on the first ornsecond wearing."
2.0,"I’ve had this watch for a week. It’s a great looking watch, seems to work well. I suspected the three extra hands on the face didn’t actually work before I ordered it, confirmed, they’re just stationary decorations. As well as the “buttons” on the side, above and below the dial. I can overlook all that, it looks good enough. But I just processed a return request, here’s why: “Band has paint flaking off the inside, the side against my skin. Tiny black paint chips on my arm and hand.” It’s sorta like my arm sanded off the paint. The outside of the band hardly has any chipped/missing paint spots on it, except the clasp portion, larger pieces of paint missing. I wasn’t expecting top quality at this price, but expected something a bit more than this."
2.0,Very thin and runs alittle small. I may use it for beach dress the front opens wide so looks like a dress surang
2.0,Didnt care for the cheap polyester feel fabric and it had an odd overall fit. Too tight in the chest (and I'm small there) while too big in the hips.<br />Returned.
2.0,smaller than 2&#34; by at least .25 inches and very thin compared to the 2 inch carabiner I was trying to replace
2.0,Must have hips to fill dress as it's already shaped.
2.0,This is definitely smaller than I thought it was going to be and the chain is missing loops so it’s hard to latch making it even shorter.
2.0,The material is too thin and clingy
2.0,super nice but i give it 2 starts because its to big .
2.0,"Nice, longer dress for the office, but I have to say that with as flowy as this dress was from the waist down, it sure seemed snug in the bust area.  A little too much so for me.  The arms were also snug - not terribly, but enough I think it would start to irritate me after a full day of wearing it.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 155lbs and usually wear a 10-12 in dress and pants and I purchased size L.  The fabric was a nice, and a heavier weight if you're looking for something for cooler weather (very, very soft fabric). I'm sorry to say I'm going to have to send this one back."
2.0,"Turned out to be see thru!  What a surprise....Also, belt tabs were waaay up high. Nowhere near my waste. Other that that, it was great! LOL"
2.0,"Too small second I buy , all brands that I had bought over the last 10 year “ Fit” I like the material and the look of this shirt , so much that went to 3x hoping it would fit , still to tight , does not meet the standard “FLOP “"
2.0,Fits tight in the size normally wear and very thin. More like a thin shirt than a sweater.
2.0,I ordered a size larger just in case and it was Still too small in length. I'm 5&#34;3 it fit but the snaps were at my waist there was no way I was going to even try to snap it.
2.0,Poorly designed. Both fit and design quality are lacking. I wouldn’t recommend this brand.
2.0,"Quite ugly - had to really see the unicorn, and chaiin was was too long for a girl I wanted to give to.  Just my perception - have many other items that were lovely"
2.0,Great pants. Great quality very comfortable. However I ordered Capri length and received full length the first time (I am 5'6 and the came all the way down over my ankles) instead of returning the pair I received I re ordered the Capri length and once again received full length! Very frustrating since the shorter Capri length is what I needed and wanted.
2.0,"After having worn this jacket for only a few days, I have one tooth on the plastic zipper that has broken off (still zips and holds - so far) and the stitching on the pockets is starting to come undone. The jacket is cheap and the quality is in line with the price. I also find it to be a bit on the small side for the size."
2.0,Not as expected<br />Rubber sole
2.0,I was not impressed at all. It hangs on the body very akwardly.
2.0,way to tight  l/xl  ok if you could get em on
2.0,"It's a nice coat, but the hood is made from something like felt.  Did not like that.  The biggest problem is that it was way too small.  I ordered XL even though I am probably just a large.  But it was still way too small.  It looks different to the picture.  It goes straight down, and does not flare out as it does in the picture on the website.  The cost of sending it back was as much as the purchase so it turned into a gift for someone else."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, but once I had it on, it felt more like a prarie nightgown.  If it had hit me a little higher on the leg I might have been able to shake that, but I just couldn't keep it because it felt like a nightgown."
2.0,"Rides low on the waist, wanted to use for hiking. Wrong pant."
2.0,"Loved the color, install was easy. Just don't like products faltering so soon after buying. The band started splitting along the connection pin, luckily I noticed before it just split entirely and my watch would have been gone"
2.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and a little less than 90 lbs, and this top fit fine at what I would consider a normal crop top length (just above my belly button). However, I returned it because I hate the type of fabric it's made of— I guess that's on me for not checking what &#34;polyester/spandex&#34; actually is! But as other reviewers have mentioned, it's basically swimsuit material, and it's shiny and looks cheap. Didn't like it at all, which is a shame because I thought the pattern was super cute."
2.0,I loved the style of this dress and the fit but the fabric was too sheer. I returned it.
2.0,"Definitely made on somebody's computer on some ghetto, not legit printing press machine. The logo is HEAVILY pixelated. Not even the same color as the actual Hamilton logo. One leg is so much skinnier than the other like a little chicken leg. The material is good and actually does have some stretch, but I'm actually embarrassed to wear this. I was so excited to wear it for the airing of Hamilton on Disney+. So disappointed"
2.0,The fabric began pilling after second wear. Fit is good love the pockets but these won't last very long
2.0,"I gave it 2 stars only because I used it when I went to Kauai and certain activities required to have aqua shoes/socks. I really loved the fit but since there is no tread/sole on these, I had a hard time in the water with rocks and even walking if there are twigs and rocks on the ground.  would recommend to really research others with an actual sole with tread."
2.0,These do turn green and some of them are really sharp to wear like the heart/devil one when you sit and stuff. Other than that they are super cute and do stay together very well.
2.0,"These will keep you dry during workouts, but there is a difference between your movement in different activities. I find that if I wear these for a one-hour cardio class, I'm ok, but 30 minutes into a run outdoors, it chafed me terribly and I was sore days afterward (this was halfway through a 5-miler). So I don't recommend these for runs over 2 miles."
2.0,I ended up returning these because they don't fit like they're shown. The picture shows them a lot looser but when I put them on they were tight on my legs. Not tight like the size was too small because the waist and leg cuffs fit just fine they're just not looser fitting sweatpants. The color was fine and the fabric seemed like decent quality.
2.0,Runs too small and gets very awkward around the breast area
2.0,Kids sunglasses should be sturdy. One of the arms broke off in less than 2 wks. They were not abused.
2.0,"It says its adjustable, but only for larger heads. They fit a 37 yo 6 ft 200lb male, barely fit 5'3"" 120lb women, and does not fit 5'2"" 100lb teen... so not really a 1 size fits all."
2.0,Hat is too small for women. It’s fits too tight and probably more for kids.
2.0,"Good material but I ordered a small, might has well been a large or medium... not the best color, I looked swallowed."
2.0,"It looks pretty in photo, not something I will wear once I received it. You get what you pay for."
2.0,to small made for tiny nipples
2.0,"The dress is very clingy.  Might be ok in black, but blue (and not blue as shown) shows too much.  Also thought it would be longer, according the the picture on lines."
2.0,"i wanted to love it, read the fine line about the body type. i was to short and the fit didnt match since it was near my knees"
2.0,Seem really small.
2.0,"The dress is made with a scratchy material. It reminds me of the metallic threads that are used in some of my scarves. The material is thin. You can see through it in areas like between your legs. When I put a pair of shorts underneath to protect some of my modesty, I found that the dress actually stayed in place and didn’t ride up. So if you wear spanx or something like that it should keep this long and at a comfortable length.<br />This really should be called a tunic more than a dress. I would only feel okay wearing this outside with leggings. It’s just maybe 1 to 2 inches too short for me to actually feel comfortable. I’m always a size medium and while this fit me, a large probably would’ve been better. It hugs a lot of the wrong places due to the type of material that it’s made with."
2.0,These are okay arch supports...but for $5-10 more you can get Superfeet which are the best insoles out on the market hands down.
2.0,I thought it would cover more of the head
2.0,it broke  in a few weeks
2.0,I like how the gloves fit but honestly they have very little lining and they were poorly constructed.
2.0,"I am 5'5&#34;, 36B, size 6 pant size, and I got a Large. It fit nicely, the material behind the lace is a weird plastic/faux leather material. Overall, the dress looked a little on the cheaper end. I was looking for &#34;the little black dress&#34; and this unfortunately was not it."
2.0,These were great but only lasted 6 months and the part between the toe popped off- not repairable. Just thought it was a bit pricey to only last 6 months.
2.0,"The description says there are 16 in a package. There are only 15, even the label on outside says 15. I ordered 4 packages and I am 4 short. I do not want to return. I just need the 4 additional that I ordered as they are for students in my classroom."
2.0,"I ordered the vibrant hot pink sweatshirt and recieved a much lighter pink shirt that looks nothing like what I ordered. Much lighter in person completely different color of pink. The only reason why I didn't send it back is because it's still a nice shade of pink and<br />it's comfortable, the seller did falsely advertise though. I did not receive what I ordered and I can see other people being upset about this. I think it's safe to say that the rest of the color choices would probably turn out the same based off my experience so beware."
2.0,Being 5’11” I bought a size up just in case. Not tall people freiendly. Too small in the torso.
2.0,"As you can see, they are not identical in size or color. Disappointing. They are also pretty small. Smaller than a quarter size opening inside the ""ring""."
2.0,Ordered this as a gift and then decided I wanted one for myself. First one arrived no problem and was well received however the second one which was supposed to be delivered 3 days ago has yet to arrive
2.0,Wanted to love this but it leaves green marks on my chest.
2.0,Used by my 7th grader.  Lining ripped within 2 weeks- upsetting
2.0,Received wrong buckles
2.0,"This dress is very flattering, due to the ruching of the fabric. Sadly, the dress is very thin."
2.0,"Wore it for a week on a trip, no odor, however it has already started piling."
2.0,not happy size was very wrong .....
2.0,"I would absolutely love this rain suit if it was smaller. It swallows my 4 year old and my 6 year old. I bought a small and it fits me (a 5'4, 135lb adult!!!) I love that it is breathable and fits over their clothing. It is perfect for outdoors and would be great for my 4 years old outdoor/nature based preschool. I wish this was smaller! For the price and the product I would buy it in a heartbeat if it was sized properly!!!!"
2.0,"I had to sew 3/4 of one of the sleeves - the seam wasn't fully sewn. The material looks cheap and is very thin. It'll work for lounging around the house, but looks too much like pajamas for me to wear it out."
2.0,I loved the feel of the material. It was very  soft.
2.0,Too small.  Not impressed with quality.  Sent back.
2.0,These frames are for a child not adult. I wish i wouldve known that before i bought them.
2.0,Shrinks easily
2.0,"I ordered a size that said was for a 9-12 month old. The actual item would probably fit a 3-4 year old, it was so big. The shirt design was really adorable and the marieral extremely soft but unfortunately the sizing was completely off."
2.0,"My son loved the fit and color of these shoes. He also loved the bungee straps rather than Velcro or Tie laces.<br /><br />HOWEVER within the first 3 weeks of school, he had lost the green grips from the front toe area. There is still some grip, but not as good as it was. My return window has already closed, so we will keep them for now, but I won't buy from this company again."
2.0,Fits smaller than the size shows.
2.0,Horrible it’s for my kids birthday and it is soooo small the shirt is perfect but the pants. The pants fit on the waste but they are bells right under her knees. They fit like floods so horrible
2.0,"Cute dress, but the waistline sat on my rib cage, making me look wide and boxy.  Dress did not hang in a flattering a-line, but rather straight. Had to return."
2.0,Much to tight.
2.0,Horrible material. Wrinkles badly and shrunk after 1st washing
2.0,"The shorts are too small, and the top is too large. I am 5'3&#34; and weigh 116 lbs, which most size charts would tell you is either small or medium.  I ordered a medium, because I don't like PJ pants to be tight on the waist. These are elastic, and while I can &#34;fit&#34; into them, they are very uncomfortable around the waistband, so I probably will not wear these unless I lose some weight first! The top, on the other hand, fits like a potato sack. I will say that the shorts are a nice length. It's just that the elastic is pulled too tight, and there is no adjustable waistband. I wish clothing manufacturers would sell tops and bottoms of PJ sets separately, and also remember that for most of us, we put on our pajamas after eating dinner. This means we might be a little bloated and ready to wear something comfortable and loose-fitting in the waist. They would probably fit fine first thing in the morning..."
2.0,Very hard to clip onto glasses
2.0,These are so small
2.0,"I wear a size medium and I was reading reviews before I bought this product and they said this product fits snug.. so I decided to get a size bigger a large and they still fit really snug, I won't be able to dry them knowing they're 50% cotton. So get a size or 2 bigger than your regular size."
2.0,"didn't make a different, still hot"
2.0,The printed label on the shirt claims the material is 100% cotton but seems very thin and cheap. I am assuming there is at least some polyester in the blend
2.0,Broke apart.
2.0,"Good color and length, but I cant tell you whether or not it is flattering because although I ordered my size, I was lucky to get it around one leg.  Order 2-3 sizes larger."
2.0,"This is exactly what I needed. Just the right size, useful pockets, great color. Unfortunately, on day two of use the magnetic closure on the front pocket popped off. No longer safe to put my phone there, which makes the whole thing useless. And, for maximum inconvenience, this happened on my way to the airport, and is the only purse I brought with me."
2.0,Material is extremely see through.  And easy to rip. Neck is very large and droopy.
2.0,When I received my package I was surprised to see that I received the black shirt instead of the green one that I ordered. Also the lace at the bottom was turned up and creased across the front. I thought it was just needing to be re-washed but that wasn't the case. I washed it and flat dried it but the crease won't come out. It looks awful!
2.0,"The logo is off center and faded... it's like they were trying to save ink. It's hard to tell when buying online, especially clothing. but, overall it's a good around the house shirt. I would never wear it in public with the off-kilter logo."
2.0,I ordered a 2 pack with the black and pink and I only received the black. I would have given it 4 stars.
2.0,"It is so poorly made,  I would not recommend... it was an immediate disappointment!  The neck of the shirt is outstretched so much (zero elasticity).  Purchased for a 7 year old whose too embarrassed to wear in public because it shouldn't be a  wide ""U"" shape collar that looks like they didnt finish sewing it!"
2.0,If you have thicker lips this is a no for you. The studs are way too small and none of them are even the same size
2.0,Disappointed....
2.0,Really cool hat but the back snap thingy isnt sewn on. Also doesnt fit my husbands head. Granted he is a tall broad man but it doesnt fit his head.
2.0,The white brim was not fluffy
2.0,"I'm normally a medium in everything and this is WAY too small! :( I'm 5'3' 140lbs, wish I had gotten a large. The skirt also is very stiff and not flowy at all but it IS a cute dress."
2.0,Am I the only person who noticed that the word “Captain” is misspelled?
2.0,I gave it 2 stars. Neat idea but quality is crap. The stitching comes apart.
2.0,"Ok first when I opened the box I noticed they were bent. I have some m readers that are,great much better than these. They are,cheap made  flimsy. Small at least compared to other reader."
2.0,The ring itself is beautiful and I wanted a small stone ring which it was BUT the stone was too dark almost looks black instead of the nice purple that was pictured.
2.0,Sent it back because I thought it was one piece--it is 2.
2.0,Broke right away and the color fades fast
2.0,Been looking for a good pair of waterproof boots and thought these may do it.  I ordered a 10W even though I normally wear a 9W.  I’ve seen a lot of reviews of Nats Boots that indicate to order a size up or a size down.  I measured my foot and used their chart before I placed the order.  My boots came in a clear plastic bag indicating they were 10W.  I immediately noticed the size on the sole of the boot indicates this is a US size 9.  I tried them on and confirmed they are a size 9 and were not wide as they were tight in the toe box.  The top of the boot is also a bit narrow for my calves.  Amazon’s return process is terrific.
2.0,Didn’t come with the tool to thread the laces which makes it nearly impossible to get them through.
2.0,Too Short and too tight. Going to return it
2.0,THESES RINGS WERE OK
2.0,wayyyy too big.<br />hugest XL ever.<br />bigger than some 2XL shirts.<br />unwearable.
2.0,It's super adorable. I really wanted to rock it.<br /><br />I'm a size 14/16. And this just did not pan out. The material and colors are spot on - but the back end? Forget it. If you've got a toosh...this is not for you.
2.0,"The shirt itself is okay. Material is nice and it fits as expected.<br />However, there is small print on the bottom of the shirt underneath the word ""ALUMNI""<br />The small print reads, ""HARRY POTTER characters, names and related indicia are (copyrighted) & (trademarked) WBEL (s17)""<br />This is clearly left out of the photo advertising this shirt; and for good reason. It looks tacky."
2.0,The band is nice but not very well made.  Within 24 hours of wearing the little piece that holds the band down broke off
2.0,The wallet is a little bulky but did a great job. A few weeks ago I noticed that every once in a while it would open on it own in my pocket.  Yesterday when I pulled it out I saw that the latch had cracked. I expected it to last longer then 6 months. Don't waste your money
2.0,The slipper is nice but unable to be warn at the size ordered. I give 2 stars because a size 10 is actually a size 8.<br />  The slipper was intended for my father who wears a size ten but actually fits my husband who wears a size 8 ...and it doesn't even fit my husband's foot loosely.
2.0,"To small, I got a large and it didn't fit, and I'm not a plus size. I have it to my sister in-law who models and it got her weirdly. Gaping in odd places. She is going to have it tailored to fit right."
2.0,Eh the sweater was just ok.  Kinda flimsy sent back.
2.0,These shirts are messing up in the washer after 1 wash in delicate. They are starting to have little places where the stitching is coming out.
2.0,Sadly I have to return this. The dress is way too small. I would have really liked the dress since it is lovely and the material is very nice but doesn't do me any good if it doesn't fit. It is at least 2 sizes too small.
2.0,Vlasp keeps opening when its on me.
2.0,The top looked pretty good but I couldn't get past how hard the cups felt ...too much like body armor.<br /><br />The bottom looked huge like a diaper and I didn't every try it on. I was mostly interested in the top.
2.0,"The description said cardinal red, it came and it is 100% pink. Not what i wanted."
2.0,To large and awkward to fit in most purses
2.0,"I got this in a large since all the reviews said to order a size up, but it's way too big and it cups in at the bottom instead of flaring out. Makes me look like a fat potato even though I'm average sized, I probably won't be wearing this. Waste of money."
2.0,"Ok, after reading reviews i thought I'd give these a chance. I ordered blue and green in large. Im 5'8"" and 155. They fit snug without being to tight that being said the material is thin and pretty stretchy. To thin in my opinion. Every line on underwear and bump and battle scar is on full view, not the look im going for. The top band was felt if you have a little/alot extra in the middle your going to feel it. Finally and probably the kiss of death for me was how very shiny they were, almost the sheen of satin. This was wholly unexpected as the pics did not reflect this and the descriptions nylon spandex ratio was that of other less reflective pants I own. I'll be returning these."
2.0,the bag is really cute and came faster than it said but oh my gosh is smells so bad i have no idea what it is i left it out side for three days sprayed soooooo much febreezzee it wont go away .. its cute i just cant stand the smell
2.0,"Bracelet was not ready to fix quick release oins, only normal pin can be fixed, seller send me quick release pins with normal spring pin bracelet."
2.0,"Neither a cardigan nor a sweater; it is a SWEATSHIRT!  I purchased a Large (I’m usually a L/12), but this fits like a Medium (8-10).  The sizing is off.  The nose is orange, and not red as pictured."
2.0,We were not able to remove the stickers on the lens.  Very disappointing.
2.0,"To be honest, I love the style! But it was much larger than I expected and the quality of the fabric looked shiny not cotton."
2.0,Not really well made.  The buckle is kind of thin metal and the belt is pretty thin material.
2.0,If you only look through the center of the lens they are OK. The perimeter of the lenses have a lot of distortion.
2.0,Didn't work for me slipped
2.0,way too slim
2.0,"The actual dress I received does not match the picture I saw that moved me to purchase it. In the picture,  the skirt is a mini length that is mid-thigh and has a flair out look and is somewhat high-waisted. The dress I received has a skirt length that is right at knee length and hangs very flat, with a waist position just above my hips instead of a high waist. I am considering returning it."
2.0,This is a nice looking dress but it was way too big and unflattering.
2.0,Looks cool but doesn't stay blowed up enough to support the head to stand up correctly.
2.0,This is cheaply made.  Certainly not worth $25.99.  More like a $10.00 Walmart robe.
2.0,"They fit perfectly and have a reasonable weight.<br />The four prongs that hold these to the glasses have plastic tube cushions - these tend to get lost pretty easily - otherwise, no complaints and I would buy again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/19/18<br />While I still love the clipons, they have scuffed my lenses so badly that i need a new pair of glasses.<br />There is no separation between the clipons and the lenses and the circumstance only gets worse with time."
2.0,"I wore this for Halloween, but only because I didn’t have another top to wear. The breast cup area is way too small and the straps are too long in comparison. I wore a white bra under mines to make it look better. As you can see in the pic, I’m falling out completely as it doesn’t cover my breasts enough."
2.0,The pocket is stitched strange and does not lie flat
2.0,Earrings look nice but are cheaply made. 2 earrings broke after a few wears.
2.0,Bought this as a fellow alumnus so my kid could match up with me. The shirt came long sleeve and not short sleeves as desired. By the time fall comes she would have outgrown this
2.0,"It's too young for my children, and I don't bother to go back.  Very troublesome"
2.0,i bought a large and when this dress came the dress top is cut too small.. the top of the dress is made for a small and the body of the dress is made for a large.. very disappointing and i am returning it..
2.0,Very pretty dress but bust and armpit holes are small. The mesh is itchy at neck.
2.0,The rings were more rings than knuckle rings
2.0,Looks great and fits nice but literally after 1 use in the pool (even before getting a chance to wash) the black parts bled into the white and now it’s stained and I don’t even want to wear it a 2nd time. I’ve bought swimsuits half this price with better quality. Would return if I could but I already wore it once so I’ll take that loss
2.0,Smells terrible… it’s basic nothing special
2.0,Runs a little small - but the legs are way too long.
2.0,"I purchased this for my girlfriend without thinking about the size of it, and as it turns out it was to small to fit her bracelet so I now have to rig up something to make it stay on her bracelet."
2.0,"First photo is by LED light. Second is natural (not direct sunlight) light coming in through a window, w/ my iPhone's shadow.  It also runs a size small. I am a medium, I got a large, and it's sized like a small. Returning."
2.0,"This bra is very poor quality (you get what you pay for).  The first time I wore it (Never even washed yet) the underwire busted through the fabric. Also, it doesn't fit an &#34;A&#34; cup size very well. I don't even come close to filling it out."
2.0,"The belt isn't even attached, no belt loops, the material is thin. Not what I was expecting. I am debating if I should send it back."
2.0,Like...none.  It rides up the thigh making it hydrodynamically inefficient.
2.0,"Runs very small, probably by two sizes or so. Absolutely no stretch to it. Pretty but lacking quality"
2.0,Not what expected in material
2.0,"They just don't look right on my face in my opinion. And the reflective outside lens show every finger print, smudge, anything and everything. And they are kind of hard to clean up, takes a lot of effort. Also, when I bend over, thehbfall off of my face. No Bueno."
2.0,The clip was too tight and it was very difficult to squeeze it open. I returned this item.
2.0,Runs very small in the waste and couldn’t even put them on properly. Definitely a lighter weight waterproof material
2.0,Turns green really fast
2.0,"I had this for maybe two weeks before the string broke, it fell off and I didn't notice and lost it. make them stronger."
2.0,Dress even though an Extra large for me fit tightly in arms and chest.
2.0,"Needed a replacement lens because the originals had pitting from sand. Product fit original frames very well. However the orange film that covers the lens started to flake off by the 3rd day. I used these lenses primarily in a non-salt water pool and they haven't lasted long. They did block a good amount of sun and are somewhat polarized, but again they just didn't last long with the mirror finish."
2.0,"Sewing on the product is a huge issue, once washed a few of the dots came off the fabric as well."
2.0,As the headline states in came in an envelope and was smashed.  It looks all dented up and even when trying to mold back it looks horrible.
2.0,The suspenders do not stay clipped.  They are fairly cheap and not so easy to return.  I would pay a little more and get better quality suspenders.
2.0,Far too small to cover my nose and mouth.
2.0,Nice dress for very casual wear. Had to return because too casual
2.0,"The cover up is beautiful, unfortunately I just received this package about 5 minutes ago and when I opened it to try it on It had a hole in the sleeve.<br />Update: I contacted Amazon and they waved the one day shipping fee abd started my return for me!"
2.0,Cute shirt but runs really really small
2.0,They not what I expected. They’re pretty but ridiculously small. WTH??
2.0,No matter how tight i wear it  somehow the back always comes forwards... it looks horrible
2.0,Very thin material.  Boo. Cool style though. That's why I'll give it an extra star.
2.0,"It's loose and the fabric is poorly constructed. Doesn't fully match description, it's not fitted and will not last after a couple of washes."
2.0,The breast pads were clearly visible and I was embarrassed wearing it in public.
2.0,"The coloring is more brown them pink, which was disappointing."
2.0,It was supposed to be a size for a youth but it isn't. So my grandson can't wear it. Unfortunately we had to go somewhere else so he would have a hoodie before the playoffs
2.0,"does not seem the same quality as the solids. Tissue thin material and way larger than than the solids I purchased, but the print is nice."
2.0,We have hardwood floors and these shoes are very slippery so I have to return them
2.0,"These shorts were super soft; however, I ended up returning them bcs they made my butt look HUGE and not in a good way."
2.0,Runs way to small in the arms. Very cute but didn’t fit.
2.0,"Nice material, but one size does not fit all.  Then did not fit my teenage son or my husband, too small, not enough stretch around the ears, so they were too tight.  They also slide up, so it you are talking they go over the chin and ride up."
2.0,I dislike the fit and would like to return it
2.0,See through and short
2.0,"Very thin, nylon material. Colors are pretty but material makes me sweat"
2.0,horrible the top part fits super loose and the waist is just a tiny strip of elastic that makes me look and feel horrible.
2.0,"This crop top is really cute but incredibly short. It just went past my breasts, it fits like a children's shirt and not a crop top."
2.0,"The compression level of these is on the milder side, the cut has them getting pulled down, and the length is for someone under 5'10"" probably. Almost come up where a 3/4 length would."
2.0,"It probably would have been fine If I had taken them to the lake or the beach but I went tubbing. The bottom of the shoes are just tread, it feels like you are wearing waterproof socks. I got so many bruises and blisters on the bottom of my feet from every since rock my feet stepped on. Like I said probably would have been good on sand or something and then the water but if you plan to walk anywhere else use cation."
2.0,This outfit sagged on me.. Didn't fit at all.. Kept it as something to sleep in..
2.0,I didn't expect much from a $15 watch but the least I was expecting was to be able to read it when I'm looking at it it's readable when your angle of view is exactly perpendicular to the watch but if it's tilted slightly above 20 degrees there is no way you can read it all you se is 8888888888i I will attach some pictures
2.0,Watch broke overnight. Button came off and can’t find it. Even if I could I don’t know if I would try to fix it cause if the button comes off that easy I doubt this is waterproof. Pretty bummed
2.0,Really nice jeans. I ordered a XXL. They are to small.. So I'm giving them to my 15 year old daughter.
2.0,"I love love love this, but unfortunate the sizing is all off. It would be better if they were more true to size  :( now I can't wear them. I washed them before tryihng them on so I don't think i'll be able to exchange these for a (much) bigger size. who knows, maybe it's the squats I've been doing.<br /><br />meow. &#62;^..^&#60;"
2.0,"The product isn't what I expected for a brand new shoes. The box was totally damaged and for me was a issue because the product it's gonna be a gift the boots looks if it was stained with something, my experience with this buy wasn't what I expected"
2.0,style doesn't look as nice in real life as it does on pictures
2.0,The fit of the top was great and the skirt was nice for showing your figure but the color was not what I expected. Returned
2.0,Does not look as good as picture lighter red. Not good quality
2.0,"Love the shoe and how it fits. But second day wearing, first day was just around my house, the side fabric is peeling. I’m really disappointed. We are headed out on vacation so I can’t really send them back right now."
2.0,Was like a bracelet for a child not an adult
2.0,I got the medium it fits like it’s a x- large very disappointed
2.0,If worn for awhile they turn your ears green. The gold coloring started coming off too
2.0,"The gloves look nice and fit well, but after 1 hour of using them while skiing, my hands got sweaty. The gloves got wet on the inside and I wasn't able to dry them. I couldn't use them afterwards because they got very cold on the inside and didn't keep my hands warm.  I tried to dry them using a hair blow dryer, but didn't work. It has been a week since I used them, they are still wet and now smell. I will throw them to the trash."
2.0,Small not adult size
2.0,"The price was great, with fast shipping. 30 horses are great and usable, but 20 of them are too raw and unattractive to use...with a horse on one side and a rough hollowed area on the other. I’ve attached a photo of the 2 styles on each side. I didn’t need 50 so I’m okay with 30, but if you need all 50 you would want to know this."
2.0,I returned it as the design stops in a weird way it doesn't look like the photo when you see it in person
2.0,"I ordered 2, both in medium and received XL’s instead. Needless to say, it was too big. Also, the color doesn’t really match the image"
2.0,Pants went to shorts after one wash...
2.0,Poor quality diamonds. The basically hold a yellow to brownish color. I previously purchased a diamond of similar price and the same CT’s and looks a a lot better
2.0,These are smaller than other KF94 masks I’ve ordered and have a strong perfume smell that fades inexplicably to the aroma of dill pickle chips. They’re also kind of flimsy and I worry that they might not actually be effective.
2.0,"These are just about right, but a little short in the back.  I think they will cover just fine when I'm wearing a shirt with a collar that can be stood up in the back, but I am pretty sure they will leave a ""sunburn"" gap when I wear a crewneck shirt.  They fit close to the ears but cover enough on the side for me without too much flapping.  They also have no snaps to smack me when the wind is blowing hard.  The elastic strap in the front is not too tight, but it holds the drape to the cap.  Considering that dark colors are hotter than light ones, I don't know why only 2 of them are light, but I guess I can get by with 2."
2.0,I bought a size up because other reviews said it ran small. This is not my experience....the top was too big which made the proportions to wide for my body frame
2.0,"Ordered these for my son to use when he is on his tablet or computer, however they were very flimsy and cheaply made so we returned them."
2.0,Waist is 3x but legs are small.
2.0,Very cheap. Clasp does not stay closed. Spend an extra $10 and get a descent band...
2.0,"The ears are not spiderwebs, mostly all black with a VERY FADED design. Cheap quality. You can see where the hot glue attached the bow to the headband."
2.0,very very very cheap looking- I guess you get what you pay for-  I will return it
2.0,"I ordered these glasses for a costume, as I imagine most who bought this would.  They were not what is pictured.  The lenses are a brownish red gradiant, not at all yellow.  Walter Sobchak has distinctively yellow lenses.  Sufficed to say, I will be returning these.  If you just want a pair of glasses and don't care if the look much like in the movie, then by all means - they seem to be of decent quality, but a replica they are not."
2.0,"Don’t Wear this Dress in the Daylight or Outside at all,  if you don’t want everybody to see your parts. 👀<br />Design I’d Pretty, but Fabric is Super Thin and See Through. Low Quality Dress for Sure.<br /><br />Can We Please Stop Making See Through Dresses and Make Thick Breathable Durable Cotton Made To Last?!?"
2.0,Bought the black one and the seams of the purse was already separating so I ordered a replacement which was even worse. The interior material has a 1+ inch crack. Very disappointing.
2.0,Plating faded within a week . Rope is also falling apart .
2.0,Loved the color and fabric. Other reviews said it ran small to order up a size. I did that. Everything fit except the bust line. If you are not FLAT it won't fit.
2.0,"It's my fault - I should have looked closer to see where the seller was from.....once it finally arrived, I was disappointed in the dress and was stuck frantically to find something else for my Halloween costume.  I would return it - but am thinking the return shipping is more than the dress is worth.....<br /><br />It did  not fit as I had hoped - whether it's the the dress or my body, just not lovin it!!!!"
2.0,"I liked the graphics, fit well. No front opening, so you have to pee like a little boy and pull them down in the front. Kinda lame."
2.0,"I love the beads... but they are guaranteed to break, that’s the cheap plastic thread that’s holding the beads together. And, Gem Jing will not respond back to you with the warranty arrangements once that issue happens."
2.0,Wish I received the black face however o got a white face with rose gold.
2.0,Material was rough and dress was several sizes too small.
2.0,"It’s a nice idea with the Lightning bolts but after one wear, it pilled ..I can’t wear it again"
2.0,This product is not true to size. It runs very small
2.0,Runs small but alittle imagination can make it work.
2.0,When trying it on one of the straps was off and that is not good. As for the length to cover up is good. But I have not used it yet. And there is no support for the twins.
2.0,"The shoes were comfortable but, within 2 months of normal wear (switching up with flipflops and other summer options), the front of the shoe split wide open. The braided part between the sole and the upper detached from the top leaving a hole in the shoe. I would not suggest these shoes to others because they cost too much not to be made sturdy enough to last. Sorry."
2.0,"The concept is cool, although it took nearly a month to arrive to TX. Warning: this can hold small items only. The hole to put the veggies into this back is tiny!  Otherwise this might have gotten more stars from me."
2.0,Feels exactly like my practice jersey in high school.  Not many things are more uncomfortable thatn these.
2.0,Returned the one inch size that is why the rating is low. Love the two inch size I would rate the two inch headbands a 5.. These are pricey headbands but you can't beat the designs! The velvet lining is key they truly do not slip.
2.0,Beautiful but it broke with second use.
2.0,This bathing suit was hysterical on me. I should have known it would not cover my 32G boobs. My right boob hung out the top and bottom of the open side. The piece looks wider than it really is. The rest of it fit fine but I can't go to the beach with a smooshed boob with a strap over it. I gave it 2 stars because it's still a cute suit for smaller boobs.
2.0,"Purchased this based on descriptions, but way too large and mediocre, so I'm returning this but it costs too much to return so I'll donate it, BUT I warn others not to purchase this."
2.0,"Not a fan. Very thin, NOT BEND PROOF, not flattering at all and not soft material. Ordered a medium.<br /><br />Reference 5'7 154lbs 30""waist 37""hips"
2.0,The white is ridiculously see through. It isn't even wearable. Returned.
2.0,The color is dingy. Not as bright as the picture. Seem like good quality though.
2.0,The description said they were non skid fuzzy socks.  They are very fuzzy and warm . But there is nothing to keep them from sliding. I bought them for my father because he isn't very steady walking and needed the warm and extra grip.
2.0,"Got the top, fits nicely. Quality is subpar but wasn't expecting haute couture for $15.99.  I'm sure it won't survive too many machine washes so wash by hand. It's 92% Rayon 8% Spandex.  I hate inside tags so when I went to cut it off I noticed the tag had an item number I had seen before from shopping for tops at Shein (tops start with the letters swtee...). I was curious so I entered it on the shein website and found the EXACT same top for $7.00. Seller didn't even change the model pictures.  If you need it shipped prime, go for it. If you don't mind waiting 2 weeks, and saving for a cup of coffee or two, search for SHEIN Cap Sleeve Solid Tee. I'm usually a Small but XS fit perfectly so size down if you're getting it. Hey, you do you boo."
2.0,Definitely didn’t look as pictured... not as full and the fabric was cheap. But it did fit great... probably great as a costume for some but not for me.
2.0,I wore it for about 1 hour per day for 1 month and the plastic headband snapped. It is now no longer wearable.
2.0,Had holes in the pockets. My hand went straight through one of them.
2.0,"I was very disappointed when I received this product. I thought when I emailed a copy of our business logo to them, that it would be professionally placed on the hat. Well, our logo was printed out on a printer in a sticker format and placed on the hat. I was like, really???"
2.0,I love the swimsuit but I got broken bottoms :( really disappointed because my birthday is coming up and I ordered this for my party..
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but unfortunately I just felt it was too frumpy and matronly. There is a lot of material in the skirt to where I felt like I was drowning in folds. My biggest issue is probably that the pockets are far too big and actually add bulk. No woman wants to add excess bulk at her hips! I almost wanted to cut the pockets out. I definitely wish they were smaller. Other than that, I just feel like the dress in general is very blah."
2.0,Not as cute as pictured
2.0,Super cute but they in a gap right at the stomach where a button should be. Also it seems to be made for extremely flat chested women. I’m only a C and it was gaping.
2.0,These are very thin and already have worn through after one wearing.  Shrunk upon first wash.
2.0,Fit did not work for me or my family so I had to return. Came quickly and returning was easy
2.0,"My feet are wide across the ball of the foot with a high arch but otherwise normal and I can usually fit a regular width shoe, but sometimes fit a wide.  I pretty much live in sandals from mid-spring through mid-fall, and unfortunately have a bit of problem with plantar fasciitis.  In years past I have found that Crocs tend to have a pretty decent arch and decent cushioning for a year but I need to replace them every spring.  This year the plantar fasciitis got worse and I've been looking for something with better support than the Crocs, and based on the very strong brand recommendations from my wife and daughter, who love their Hoka running shoes, I got this pair of Hoka flip flops (ordered directly from Hoka).<br /><br />The Hokas started out as a partial disappointment and after three weeks, turned into a near-total one, so I returned them.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:  These sandals, in size 11 Mens, have fairly sturdy feeling cloth straps.  They have a two-layer sole, soft and cushy on the top layer, more firm underneath.  The top layer is similar to the soft sole of an Oofos flip flop - a really soft memory foam that is only good for a recovery sandal, not supportive enough for walking around, no matter how great it initially feels, as I sadly discovered a few years back with a new pair of Oofos that I mistakenly thought would be good to wear for a twelve-hour day at Disney World.  I would describe the arches as medium, not as high as a Chaco arch (but in a normal position, not a full inch too far back toward the heel as on a Chaco), and there was a heel cup but not overly deep.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Sole - the two-layer sole feels good on tired, sore feet.  Initially these sandals were comfortable and relieved my plantar fasciitis pretty well.<br /><br />No strap wear between toes.  One of the half-dozen pairs of Crocs flip-flops I've owned originally had a bit of sharp-edged rubber flashing that wore through the skin on the crook of my big toe, causing a lot of pain.  No such problem on these Hokas.<br /><br />Adequate traction.  A few of the pairs of Crocs I've owned have been a bit slippery on wet surfaces, but the Hokas did not have that problem.<br /><br />Odor resistant - I wore them most days over a three-week period and did not experience any odor from them.  Actually, I don't think I've ever had that problem with flip flops but do have a pair of Keen leather sandals that I've got to wash periodically and treat with tea tree oil.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />First and foremost, these flip flops were not designed for a normal man's foot, but were far more suited for a very large person with a very thick, chunky foot.  Standing flat-footed, I could slide my whole hand up to the palm between the top of my foot and the top of the two straps leading from the toe.  The straps were so excessively sized and loose that they were not good for walking long distances.  I also did not feel comfortable wearing them while driving because they were too loose on my feet and I did not feel they would be secure enough to brake precisely in an emergency situation.<br /><br />Second, the midsoles are not durable.  After three weeks of wear, the arches had broken down, were not providing the initial level of support and my plantar fasciitis pain got worse.  Maybe the straps stretched a bit, too, but three weeks into ownership, they were feeling very loose on my feet and not providing adequate support even just to wear around the house.<br /><br />Value.  These are relatively simple items of footwear and there is no reason they should cost 30-50% more than a pair of better-made Reef sandals.  Considering how fast the midsole wore out, they are less well built than the Crocs I have worn for years, and I could literally buy three pairs of Crocs for the price of a single pair of Hokas.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />After three weeks, I sent these back to Hoka for a refund.  Between the straps being too loose and the midsole breaking down and losing support, they were no long wearable for anything other than just wearing around my bathroom and bedroom.  I don't recommend these flip flops at all."
2.0,"These looked so good in the pictures and I thought they would look slimming on me, but when I tried them on they did not. Additionally, the stitching where the gray and black come together is thicker than I expected. I found that uncomfortable and since I was planning on using these while doing aerial hammock, I can imagine that the stitching would just dig into my leg where I have the aerial fabric wrapped around it and that I would not be able to move around the fabric as smoothly and easily as I would with pants that didn't have the stitching there. It also had a zip pocket in the back, which I didn't notice in the description and for aerial stuff I'd be a little concerned it would catch and tear the aerial fabric. I think when I did the bend over test in these, I was just barely able to see my bright underwear through it. These pants would probably be good for other activities. They seem to be good quality, but I'll be returning these because they aren't what I'm looking for unfortunately."
2.0,"Larger than expected, strap is too stiff."
2.0,Faded design. Shirt was soft but small.
2.0,"Was hopping to use this for at least nursing later, but couldn't even get the buttto close on my chest. The fabric is nice and light though. And I appreciate it had pockets. Maybe order a size or two up for this one."
2.0,"Lindo vestido lastima la calidad de la tela, de no ser por la tela que es demasiada calurosa y parece una bolsa me hubiese encantado"
2.0,"In the description it says 100% cotton and it is not complete cotton, it is 60% cotton and I will return it :/"
2.0,My wife wore these sporadically since Christmas. This past week one of the arms just broke while she was putting them on. The plastic broke right on the hinge.
2.0,"While the fitting is good, has a factory chemical scent to the masks; have not tried washing them yet. I got one mask that was also stained upon arrival. So it didn't seem sanitary. These aren't factory sealed, they are put in a zip lock bag with lettering. They are labeled as ""fashion masks"". The fitting is good for an over-fit for dual layer mask wearing, in part due to the larger than average sizing (is about 1.5 inch longer than your typical mask) and an adjustable elastic strap."
2.0,"After 1 wash, the dress has a small tear and ended up tearing about a 6 inch split at the bottom. Now it's just a house dress."
2.0,Two of the beads had fallen off and a strong was loose.
2.0,"I try not to be so critical of reasonably priced items, but this set was all over the place for us... The top is true to size but the bottoms run small.  The fact that the bowtie/suspenders and the shorts are two different shades of red drove me nuts (maybe my OCD?🤣) so I will be returning. For reference; my son is 3'3, 34lbs and wears a 4t which is what I ordered."
2.0,"The fabric is very clingy, not good for summer"
2.0,Cute but busy area really large I ordered a medium size
2.0,Too tight and too thin.
2.0,I wanted to love this truly! The material was AMAZING! Super soft and felt like a dream. I am a true Large (5'5 tall and 170 pounds) and ordered an XL just to be extra comfy. However the XL hugged skin tight to my skin. I felt like I needed a 3XL for it to be somewhat oversized. I had to return unfortunately but please learn from my mistake and size up at least 2 sizes (for exact fit) and 3 sizes (for slight oversized).
2.0,"The silver lanyard came broken in the package. I was able to fix it but still pretty unacceptable that I came that way. Gold one was fine—cheap looking yellow gold, but gets the job done. Really really annoyed that the silver one was broken."
2.0,I didn't get all the earings
2.0,"Fit was good, but the fabric was super cheap. It was so thin that you would need a slip--maybe with a cute slip it would work."
2.0,"I so wanted this to fit!  It is the cutest outfit and I love the cut of the top.  Unfortunately, the bottoms are perfect but I would need a serious boob job for the top to fit.  I'm built fairly average, but literally would need to have a D+ cup to fill the top.  If this is you, you'll love this outfit!"
2.0,"This is cute but the “one size fits all” only applies to little children I believe. It’s like a tiny little crop top, made me laugh when I pulled it out."
2.0,These shoes were too small.  I ordered a size 9m according to their sizing chart.  The shoes only fit a size 8m or 8-1/2m.  I decided not to return them and regifted them.
2.0,"2 Pack of Womens Cable Knit Leg Warmers Knitted...I could deal with the leg warmers being a bit large, but one of the grey pair was raveling at the top.  I am disappointed to say the least.  I contacted seller and asked for a discount or replacement in an effore to not have to return."
2.0,They don't stay in place
2.0,"Not a sweatshirt, hardly a shirt. Harsh, thin material and most defiantly not a sweatshirt. My bra shows when I lift my arms."
2.0,"Product ran small, size up 1 size"
2.0,top was too small and bottom too big
2.0,Not good. the plastic loops that at the end of the chain are horrible and they keep sliding off.
2.0,ONE SIZE DOSE NOT FIT ALL. SENT BACK.
2.0,Very thin fabric and sized very small - way overpriced
2.0,"They feel good, and they fit okay.  They were a bit too big in the waist, and I have to frequently pull them up. I've washed them three times, and the seams are already falling apart.  I've had to sew up one seem on the right thigh that's already come undone, and the same seam on the left side looks like it's about had it with life. The waist is already falling apart."
2.0,"i bought this for my friend who loves giraffes. she really liked the necklace, but, a gem fell off and then she ended up losing it so she couldn't return it :(.. i'm assuming it was a cheap quality necklace. (she lives in another state so i never got to see it)"
2.0,"Looked great and fit well out of the box. After two wears, stretched so much they will no longer stay on feet."
2.0,Pretty flimsy product.
2.0,This dress looks nice but is extremely short. I ordered my regular size and I can't wear it it's so short.
2.0,"I was disappointed by how thin and clingy the material was--being 95% cotton I expected more of a t-shirt feel. This was more poly feeling. Size was okay except for the amount of material around my midsection. I wear a 40&#34; and the XL fit well around my shoulders and bust, but it was really big around my midsection--it made me look pregnant."
2.0,This is great for a costume or cosplay but a little on the cheap side for everyday wear which is what I wanted it for. The fabric is kind of thin and looks very plastic.
2.0,Fits to tight.. I usually wear a medium but when the dress arrived I could never t get it on. I exchanged an got a large. It fits but too snug. The neck band is like a noose.
2.0,Too stiff and looks cheap. I didn't like the way it looks and feels on my wrist. Had to return it.
2.0,Used in a factory setting when wearing a mask and safety glasses to avoid from fogging up. Followed directions explicitly but the product didn't seem to have any longevity. And re-cleaning and re-applying several times a day just wasn't feasible.
2.0,"Neck was super tight and was shirt was long. I’ve ordered 3 shirts from ripple, all 3 XL, and they all fit very differently. Very disappointed. Too much of a pain in the ass to return. Probably won’t buy again."
2.0,"I bought this for my son and after a little over a month,  the zipper broke. ...he is a student in ARMY ROTC and users it to carry his clothes and boots for PT so he doesn't over load it. .. that was disappointing."
2.0,I used this band for about two months now it’s discolored and peeling even when using proper care methods so I’ve already had to replace it with another band. Unimpressed.
2.0,Great for little kids or teens not adult size
2.0,These socks do not stay up.
2.0,It's going to be warm but it's not as snug as it needs to been. I wouldn't buy another one. Alittle disappointed.
2.0,"Extra small, buy at least 2 sizes bigger"
2.0,Beautiful dress and pattern. I love the feel but the fit is really really off. I'm going to have to lose ten pounds to fit this.
2.0,These look nothing like the picture. Huge beads ~ looks cheap. Super heavy. Not at all what I expected.
2.0,Got many compliments but they only last through one night of dancing max
2.0,This was a beautiful dress and well made with vibrant colors. Ended up returning it due to it looking more like a robe than a dress on me. I'm 5'0 120lbs. It went a little past mid-thigh
2.0,"The mask is super breathable, but the only issue is with how fragile the war loops are. I’ve had my mask for about two months, and they both just ripped. I’ll order another one, but just be aware."
2.0,"If you are thinking these are bigger and fatter and roomier than a normal cushy slide, then you are underestimating these.  They are made for a human foot not previously seen. Think along the lines of Shaquille O'Neal. Very very squishy though! I might try 4 sizes down. (Not kidding.)<br /><br />EPILOGUE: Seller offered free pair to make up for situation however perfect fit unattainable. I appreciate the customer however I will be returning all pairs as I tried literally 4 sizes and either to short or too wide. Just not a good fit for a normal sized foot. I really wanted to like these because they feel like taffy."
2.0,Certainly not what is shown. Actual colors are much darker and it’s smaller than pics show. I knew it was an inexpensive bag but was surprised how different it is from description and pictures.
2.0,"item was shipped very promptly, 2 days. packaged well. not as described. Lining was described as shearling, white wool, this lining is a fuzzy man-made stuff that looks like a carnival toy. the leather is not as pictured, more like 1970's pimp-wear. overall, not impressed."
2.0,"This umbrella has a couple of small holes in the fabric. I love the size and how it covers my rectangular table, so I will be looking to try a replacement."
2.0,"It didn’t meet my expectations, I thought it was a box chain but it is not."
2.0,"The magnet is weak and releases very easily when you stick your hand in your pocket. If you're  lucky, your money will fall safely back into your pocket instead on the ground  like mines did."
2.0,The material is not what I expected but it’s more like a outdoor garden flag material but the biggest problem was the fit I ordered a large per the size chart which fit except the bust. As the photos seem to be loose in the bust it was so tight I could barely breath I am busty but a typical large in any top usually fits but this was beyond tight.
2.0,"I ordered my usual size and while it fits around me,  the whole site just feels too small. The waist is very short...and I have a short waist and its still too short. It pulls my boobs down. There is absolutely no support for them at all and the 'cups' are very small.  My B cups are all over the place, lots of side boob.  The bottoms do not cover the whole bottom either.. its more like half way between a thong and a full cover. Also,  the white lining is popping out on the ends like everywhere.  I just feel so uncomfortable and exposed in this suit I won't ever be able to wear it. This is definitely meant to show off what you got,  it's not at all as modest.. I guess for lack of a better word.. as the picture would have you believe.  I can't even give it points for being good quality because the white under liner is everywhere. Very unfortunate,  I was excited about this one"
2.0,Its VERY small!
2.0,"While the shorts are super adorable, they didn't come with a matching tank top as described."
2.0,Very easily rips at pockets on every pair I have.
2.0,There cool but don't fit
2.0,My 5 year old burned holes through the soles and the toe within 2 months.  That stinks!!!  They look pretty - but that's about it.
2.0,Love this color but and really wanted it to work but not for large chest.
2.0,"Gave 2 stars, the glasses were exactly what my daughter was looking for in quality but she wanted orange ones.  They don't even sell red, so it wasn't like they sent the wrong one by mistake. It was labeled orange too.  Sent back immediately."
2.0,"Theses are cute as hell but the hook broke that goes into my ear .... first time I wore... they were fixable, but you should know they are heavy!"
2.0,Makes me look older...
2.0,Jacket is warm but is very poorly made.<br /><br />Stitching is not very neat and it came with a bunch of hanging threads.<br /><br />Hand pockets don’t have warm liner and are lined with nylon.<br /><br />One of the hand pockets broke on the second day of using it.
2.0,I like the material and the fit but the zipper broke the first day...
2.0,Dress is beautiful but too Small i got a Medium.....Usually wear a size 10....
2.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap, and nasty.  Save your money unless you are buying for a young child. Tacky."
2.0,"Not what I  expected, very fuzzy feeling from the fabric. Feels lind of small too."
2.0,Cute but broke during the first wear!
2.0,I thought the advertising was deceiving.  The earings show two on the ad but you only receive one piece which I missed in the advertising.  I purchased for my grand daughter so hopefully she knows it is only one earring
2.0,Not a romper it's a short dress 😪
2.0,"For size reference-- I am 6' tall with an athletic build.  There were a lot of reviews on this dress saying it was super long, so I thought GREAT!  It'll fit my tall frame.  Negative.<br /><br />It was about 2.5 / 3 inches from the tops of my feet.  I also ordered the size XXL in wine red and the waist fit more like a MEDIUM.  The sizing was kind of all over the place.  Was not super impressed with this product and am returning it."
2.0,"It fit, but was not flattering. Decided to return it."
2.0,I bought in 2 different sizes for both my boys. My younger one got all the items that were supposed to be in it but my older boy (5-6) is missing the suspenders. So disappointed.
2.0,top wayyyyyy tooooo smalll. dont bother
2.0,They were smaller than pictured.
2.0,"Pretty, but cheap, i ordered back in July, after wearing it almost daily the piece on the pendant that holds the necklace snapped off completely, and sent the whole thing shattering to the floor. Its ok bc you get what you pay for. The silver was already rubbing off and turning pink. Needless to say my replacement is not coming from here."
2.0,The outfit looks sooo much cuter than fit the lace just rolls around and the side boob area no support and the thong just seems smaller for me size 12
2.0,Way too small - not at all what I expected!
2.0,It’s not flattering on and it looks cheap like a costume
2.0,Does not look like it’s photo
2.0,"Its okay as far as jewlery goes, but I won't order this again."
2.0,"The pattern is upside down, but it's huge so I may be able to fix it.<br /><br />Nice thick material, so I know it'll be durable. Tiny pockets though."
2.0,Item was really big and the buttons too low.
2.0,"This mask  looks super cool but is WAY too small. Even though it sats its for an adult, I had to cut the chin strap off and cut the nose<br />to make it more comfortable for my 11 year old because it was crushing her face."
2.0,If you have a wide foot it’s definitely not for you.
2.0,Cheap. Were ripped inside before even worn. My 12 year old will destroy them in no time. 👎
2.0,"These are ok. Not worth what I paid.would not wear in public, I'd be afraid they would rip. One of the rhinestones fell off when I first tried them on. Comfortable to wear at home and looks cute with a tunic. Just not quite the jegging I'd hoped for."
2.0,I was expecting a better product based on reviews but it was plain looking
2.0,Too big for a new born.
2.0,Way too large for an earpiece. The screwed backing also doesn't hold it in place.
2.0,"Edited... the company contacted me and sent a new dress. So far so good.<br />It is a beautiful dress , I bought 2 of them for the flower girls,  before the wedding even started the zipper came apart on my youngest granddaughters dress. The other one was fine. So it's a 50/50 chance you may get a good dress. Very disappointed . And the flowers on the front were flimsy."
2.0,"Was disappointed in this necklace...I've got many pieces from the different sites on here, and have been OVERLY pleased, but this one was a huge disappointment :( Looks cheap....you get what you pay for BUT have paid this price and lower and got much nicer pieces"
2.0,Seams on the front of the boobs isn't a good look.
2.0,"Like most companies in other countries, China also does not sew by USA standards and as always, their clothes run very small compared to the same size in USA.  The same is true for this company.  I ordered 2 dresses and both of them were 2 sizes too small!  Also, they make their items out of Rayon which should not be machine washed or dried. Who has time to hand wash and hang dry clothing these days?  These dresses like nice when you first buy them, but they do not last and their sewing is substandard at best long, loose threads hanging from every seam!"
2.0,"I didn't like the way the buckle sat out pretty far, ended up returning it.  No issues with the quality or functionality."
2.0,"They are super skinny so putting them on and taking them off is kinda a hassle.One of the &#34;owls&#34; eyes had a glob of dried glue around it,other than that they are a nice moss green and while abit tight are pleasing to wear."
2.0,I can't wear these sandals because my foot slides to the side with each step. I have to flex my toes to keep the shoe on while walking.
2.0,Dsnt look at all like in pic...color is darker n very thin material. Returning.
2.0,"Not sure how the shirt is made but at the bottom of the heart, there is a decent sized white line on the outside of the design. Being that the shirt and design is dark, it sticks out and makes the product look cheap."
2.0,"These look better than they are. Pieces break off rather easily and a few areas are difficult to flip colors. The size is for smaller heads, barely fitting my adult head."
2.0,It's like old watch that lasted forever i found it. The thing I do not like is that the band is to small if I was a little bigger it would never fit it's either designed for a kid or a women
2.0,"This item is variably described as breathable cotton (which it isn't) and nylon (which it is).  It's not very comfortable to wear, as it's a bit abrasive.  The clasp felt cheap and actually came off after a couple of days, due to the pin falling out.<br /><br />I just went back to the original, manufacturers band.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this one.  There are better NATO bands out there."
2.0,"I loved the look of this belly ring, but it broke after two weeks."
2.0,"Dress received was similar to the one in the picture but not the same one. It looked like something I would have ordered from the Wish app. It still looked cute, but had I known I was going to get a ‘same same but different’ dress, I would have picked something else. Thanks though. Served it’s purpose."
2.0,to small also didn't have a hat size in hat
2.0,"Should have expected this due to the price. Unfortunately, the dress did feel cheap. The waist also sat at my ribs. Great concept, but sadly the dress did not work"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:513e8d0ab710036bc14fc890ecd80076]] This item definitely not as described. There is no led lights on it and it is flimsy latex.
2.0,"This product is not for children, the wand is pointed, hard and can be dangerous when children run or play with it."
2.0,Extremely small😡😡😡😡😡
2.0,It's about one size to small
2.0,"This purse actually looked better in person than on the ad.  We were please at first but after the 3rd use it broke!! I guess that’s to be expected with something that is inexpensive but, it should have been even half the cost of is something that is going to last 2.5 uses!"
2.0,NOT a warm coat. A spring or California fall jacket.  NOT warm wool as I expected according to the description.
2.0,I sent this product back. It was too large and cheap looking. The band does not have the soft rubber feeling of the fitbit brand.
2.0,"I got the 3 pack set with single, double, and triple band styles. I'm an average sized female but these chokers were ridiculously loose. Even on the tightest setting, it just sagged at the base of my neck. So not cute. I'll try and see if it'll fit on my friend who's a bigger girl.Even if it's priced low, and the material is flimsy,  i would still wear it for fashion jewelry. But not with how loosely it fits.  Bummed cuz I was excited to wear them,"
2.0,There is very little support to these shoes. Disappointed in this brand but a good looking shoe. I wear womens size 8 and ordered a men's size 7. It's a 1/2 size too big and looked wide on my foot. I'm still gonna wear them regardless.
2.0,"I was excited about this because I have another Maxi dress just like it from Amazon that I absolutely love, but this is surprisingly totally different. First, it's not the nice thick cotton I expected, it's very thin, and only the top is cotton, the bottom is some other material. Most importantly, it's HUGE. I am 5'3"" 105lbs..not a super tiny person, most things fit me well... I ordered an X-Small and the top is very loose, you can see down the neckline when bending over and it's just baggy and unattractive. The length is crazy long...even in 6 inch heals it would still be dragging on the floor!!  I'm so disappointed. I don't know how anyone can wear this. You need to be really tall and really busty."
2.0,Didn't like it color is weird
2.0,Pjs are attractive and lightweight for summer. I washed them before wearing and they shrunk almost a full size. I can’t imagine what they’ll do after a second washing.<br />Still shrinking- I would Not recommend these pjs - can’t return after washing.
2.0,Quality isn't great.
2.0,I am extremely disappointed from the size.  I bought the shoes according to provided size chart however the it comes very small and i was forced to buy another one and this one remain at home with no use and not able to return since i left the states for a long period.
2.0,"The top loop was ripped out when we received it, but it was way too small anyway. I hope a replacement comes in time for the wedding. I'll adjust rating when we get a new one."
2.0,Item did not arrive in gift box as described in description and is extremely thin. Almost barely visible. Also not nearly as gold as in the picture. However it does have the 925 stamp so hoping it will at least not perish quickly. Lets see.....
2.0,"Beautiful, but you seriously can not be larger than a size 4 or a very small framed 6. One size fits all does not apply to this piece."
2.0,"They fit your usual kids glasses but have poor plastic clips. My kiddo has been in glasses since 18 months and I'm use to these being too big- no big deal, I can sew them. However this is the first strap that lasted less than a month. The clips broke way too quickly for the price and when this go there isn't much you can do to fix it."
2.0,"A petite woman, I was hoping to find a replacement for the terrific pair of behind-the-head earmuffs I found years ago.  I loved the fact that that pair folded up into a pocket-size disc.  However, that probably was what led to my losing that pair.  I had hoped these might be a replacement and, since a multi-pack, that if I DID lose them I would have some backups.<br /><br />These are not very unisex - I think they might fit most men pretty well, or maybe just bigger people than me.  The outer covering is attractive, but as another reviewer mentioned, they sort of stand away from your head.  Not as warm as the smaller pair I once had.  Also, they don't seem to be flexible at ALL.  I can't find a way to fold these up.  So they aren't something you can have in your pocket or bag and pull out if the weather turns cold/windy.<br /><br />I'm returning them and will keep hunting for the kind I once had!"
2.0,I love the looks of this outfit but the white shirt arrived with a stain on the front. Its a Christmas present so I don't have time to send it back. I just hope it washes out!
2.0,"This dress says that it is 100% polyester, yet it cannot be put in the dryer, so I line dried it and it had wrinkles!"
2.0,"The fabric has very little give to itfeels cheap and the extra large is tight on me at 38"" bust,32"" waist and 5'5"". Those who complained about the sizing gave five stars so I missed those, thinking it was all good. I'll just cut the baby sleeves off and rock my boobs in a tight tank I guess."
2.0,"Good price and look cute out of the package. On closer inspection, the seams around the fingers look like they are starting to unravel, and I haven't worn them more than a few minutes.<br /><br />Will see."
2.0,These cut in at the knee and right below the butt. I’m fit and a body builder with low fat and they still cut in. Not high waisted as I hoped.
2.0,This hat looks nothing like the photo. It is thin and cheaply made and barely covers the head. It provides little or no cover to your face. I will be returning it.
2.0,The cup size was way too small.
2.0,They hurt because they were cheaply made. I sent them back.
2.0,Too large and way way too long. Returned
2.0,These did not meet my expectations. I tried on numerous pairs of this style Oakley in the stores. They were all perfect. These are a little tight. Causes pain behind the ears and pressure on bridge of nose. They do not fit like true oakleys. The box they came in was worn and looked old. I hope these are not a rip off of Oakley. Hard to tell.
2.0,"Very nice; but, way smaller than expected.  Will be returning for a larger pair."
2.0,Arrived broken! I didn’t have time to get anouther necklace or send it back due to the event I bought it for so I took the butterfly charm and put it on a different chain. Worked out fine but not what i paid for.
2.0,Way bigger than they appeared. Returned immediately.
2.0,Very itchy and uncomfortable material!
2.0,"It is a very cute blouse.  Unfortunately it came with many loose threads on most of the seams.  There is also an extra panel in the front (I assume because it is see-through), but the panel just looks ridiculous and it is not even sewn to the shirt.  The shirt  looks cheap.<br /><br />Ordered white."
2.0,"This was a gift and the comments made to me were...hard to set the time and date because the stems are hard to pull out,  not comfortable on wrist and it is just a cheap watch."
2.0,"too granny looking, left bow came loose almost immediately, junky and fugly!"
2.0,"I was shocked that they were more designed for younger children 2-8yrs of age. They are not the 80 glasses I was use too. They are generic plastic frames that are flat slats not the protruding ones you may think,or as the image portrays."
2.0,The sizing of this dress is bad. I always buy a size small and this one fits like a XS.
2.0,I am not happy with the quality of this necklace for the price I paid.  It looks cheap and I will not be giving it as a gift as I had intended to do
2.0,"Am upset 😡 really upset. Ordered a large in the dam product and tag said large but pants says extra large now the it to big much to big. Disappointed.  So there is nothing I can say about comfort, stretch or any other crap."
2.0,"I was super excited after seeing the reviews on these track suites that I ordered four different colors. Upon receiving them, I tried the pants on which were pretty good. The fabric is so comfy, stitching was so so but still nice. I opened the top and was immediately shocked. The top was not your normal size small, more like a child’s x small. I could bare my zipper the top and the sleeves ended at my shoulders which is NOT like the picture. I don’t know what happened but I am sooo upset that I have to return all of it because the top size is ridiculously tiny."
2.0,I bought this to use as a part of a costume.  It is really small and pretty cheap.  I am petite and it barely went around my shoulders. It was fine for what I needed it for.
2.0,Ordered XL but size was way smaller than a normal XL
2.0,Im a plus size girl that wear a size 20 and i ordered a size 20 in these jeans they fit like a size 16 or 18 not no 20 so i have to unfortunately send them back
2.0,"The item itself is as described, but the watch  box came covered in very sticky tape that ruined the box. Giving this as a gift and disappointed in how it will look when it’s opened, considering this is not a cheap present"
2.0,Was looking for a good quality adult clip on tie. Medium to poor quality. Looks cheap. Don’t get any moisture on it. Stains real easy even with water. Poor quality. A four out of ten.
2.0,Runs very small and writing is hard to read
2.0,Bunches around the heel and sticks out of shoe.
2.0,One of the pins of the earrings bent the first time i used it.
2.0,"I'm a fairly big woman and I tried to tighten it as much as I could before I thought the string would break,  but the hat is too big.  it comes over my eyes and I can't see.  Maybe I should cut holes in the hat for my eyes.  No wonder they are selling them so cheap.  Maybe I'll put a towel in my 10 gallon hat.  I bought it for the wrap around anyway.  No way to tighten it up around the ears either.  It falls off my ears. It should of been made to button on the hat.  I guess I'll tie a string around it to keep it on and wear another hat that I have.  Too much work."
2.0,"Doesn't look like the photo. I purchased this because of the pinkish/purplish accents in the photo, and it would go great with my favorite coat and tie many of my outfits together. No pinks or purples all in the product. Blues and greens only. Very lightweight and thin. Soft. Exceptional value price wise. But I waited 3 weeks to receive a product that does not look as advertised."
2.0,Love the glasses love the color of the lenses but don't like the fact that most of .k mmkthem were bent when I got them.0
2.0,It completely stops running and then starts up again after a couple hours. The design is cool though.<br />Would return but I already added an extra hole.
2.0,"not an attractive dress or, perhaps, it just doesn't work with me in general. It would be perfect for a jane  (Tarzan) cosplay though!"
2.0,"It was a lot smaller then expected in the cup and strap. I'm short and usually straps have to be tightened all the way, this one had to be let out. The bans was the right size and I liked that it came with an extension piece."
2.0,"The picture came out great, but the angel wings, one broke already. So it doesn't close. My daughter has only worn it twice and not in the shower. Just stinks because it was a picture of her YaYa that passed away."
2.0,Terrible quality of rubber. Doesnt have any give. Feet hurt after 1 hr of wear.
2.0,its really super small..
2.0,It was a nice ring but can not be tungsten. It broke in half! We had it for about two years..then he slapped his bro on the back and boom split in half perfectly. I never review stuff so. Maybe its 13$ now because they know its crap
2.0,"Had to return because the Velcro sticks to EVERYTHING. Good luck putting it on, because it was a mess for me"
2.0,North Face did not design a very good hat. It fits poorly and puts a lot of pressure on my forehead. The only way to comfortably wear it is to either make it really loose or point it upward.
2.0,I’ve only had this sweatshirt a month and the seams in the front pocket are all coming apart. So disappointing.
2.0,"So I stupidly followed the advice of other reviewers and bought the S/M size, as a women's 8.5 shoe - they HURT!  They're way too tight on my calves, literally digging into them to the point of pain.  By the end of my flight, it looked like I had rug burn, and my legs hurt to touch!  I had to put neosporin on them and take a painkiller.  Ouch :("
2.0,"Too short, cheap thin material, not as I expected."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. In between the fingers, the seams were unraveling before I could even take them out of the bag :("
2.0,"Lint magnet... Shrinks in dryer. The seams between the colors are bulky, not a &#34;seamless&#34; sewing job. I can feel the inner seam on my arms and it is bit annoying. Also the sleeve cuff seem stitching job is oddly bulked up. Don't wash it with anything that may leave lint. Anything sticks to the dark side effects, can't really notice it on the lighter sleeve. Lint roller helps a little. My fleece coat left a whole mess of lint on the shirt."
2.0,"Ode red a size larger than I would normally get and it was still much too small  and didn’t have a lace for the front. Very stiff material not soft, flattering or comfortable"
2.0,"I'm sorry, I was not able to see well with these glasses and had to send them back."
2.0,Material seems/ feels thick. But doesn’t hold up to squat test. These would be ok for some lower impact group classes.
2.0,"Look and feel very cheap. Mine were cut unevenly and I didn’t use them, instead I ended up throwing them in the garage."
2.0,"There's three nose rings in this that are weird shaped and hard to get in your nose, I question whether or not they are even nose rings."
2.0,Not really what I expected. They are pretty tiny
2.0,"The dress was beautiful and fit according to size, but it was so cutting underneath the arms that I had to return it."
2.0,Does not look like the picture.  Look really bad.
2.0,Too small and I thought it looked very inexpensive. Didn't like the clasp.
2.0,"Band was inflexible. When you put it through the bracket and folded it back, it would not fold flat, but formed a loop."
2.0,too big and do not want another one. thank you
2.0,socks were tooo tall and fit over my knee - I am 5'6 with average sized legs and when they go over my knees my legs look like sausages... :( I will give them to a friend with my longer thinner legs!
2.0,It's cute but the buttons fell off on the first wear. Doesn't look like pic. You can easily tell that it's made poorly. I'm 5'0 and 105lbs. I got a size small but it fits funny
2.0,"This suit came extremely tight on the bottoms, but the top fit decent but did not look well with smaller boobs."
2.0,Pretty thin material. Just ok
2.0,Way to big and way to long!
2.0,Too small.  For a 4 year old.
2.0,"Runs small specially around arms, It came very wrinkled,I washed in cold water and air dry on a hanger, trying to get the wrinkles out . It is as wrinkled as it came in the package. It definitely looks better in photo than in reality. I hate having to return stuff, therefore i will never buy blouses from this particular page."
2.0,Beautiful and utilized already
2.0,"Like others have stated it's much larger than expected, certainly larger than the pin in the movie. It fills up my palm fairly well and I have large hands. The detail is nice and double sided so if it gets switched around it doesn't lose its appeal. But the chain is absolute rubbish. Attach one side to a gallon of milk and try pulling it across the table and it would surely break. I would suggest buying a better chain or strap to match the patina."
2.0,"Gorgeous dress and the quality looked impeccable, but it did not fit according to the size chart. Bummed to have to return in."
2.0,"The picture makes the product look great. When you receive it, it is made out of cheap items and looks like a young kid out it together."
2.0,received today and it broke today.. cheaply made but very sparkly. just wish it wasn’t so flimsy
2.0,"Wasn't very happy with this pair of pants.  Could be elegant but the fabric is more &#34;KMART&#34; old polyester type consequently, the bottom hem doesn't lay flat when worn.  Doesn't look very good except that it does appear to drape nicely."
2.0,Disappointed in this dress....... It is very cute but it runs a bit small. I sized up to a large so that it would not be tight fitting but the shoulders are very narrow and I could barely move my arms when I put it on.
2.0,"In the photo they appear to be vibrant colors, but when you get them the colors are pale and they look cheesy like a sticker you can peel off."
2.0,I did not like this product and I don’t think I will wear it.
2.0,Veryt flimsy fit . Too tight.  Not comfortable. Not a good look.
2.0,Part of the keychain was missing
2.0,just personal preference.  didn't like the fabric.  too thin.  returned product.
2.0,the bag is nice but the color was not as advertised- i ordered sunshine yellow and got a muddy looking gold shade- the color looks nothing like the bag as shown here
2.0,wont stay together
2.0,I really like the look of this but it’s way too narrow for me.
2.0,"Love the look, wish I had known it ran small...."
2.0,"The fabric is such nice quality, but the cut of the suit is so poor. It's like the maker has never seen a human. As the sizes go up, the add extra ""flaps"" of material for the bust instead of making the entire top part larger. I've tried every brand that has this suit to no avail. Just avoid.<br /><br />(No photos as they are x rated)"
2.0,"As others have written, I was looking for a specific blend. Most of these stated 79% polyester and 21% spandex but the ones I was looking for are 88% polyester and 12% spandex. The ones I bought stated 88% so I got them. When they arrived, the blend was the 79%. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal but with the 79% I had purchased in the past, after two washes they had started to fall apart at the seams. The 88% have not done that and I've had them for a few years now. Unfortunately the 79% blend isn't as durable or comfortable."
2.0,"I opened the box today and the gloves had a small hole in the palm, otherwise works as described. Will not order a second pair."
2.0,ok but why not just get a regular red scarf instead of special ordering it
2.0,"Looks nothing like the picture, the dress definitely isn’t mopping as it doesn’t come close to the ground, and I’m only 5’2. Fabric is heavy so it doesn’t really flow or hang nicely. Waitband is really tight and color was a lot less rich than I expected. I can see how someone might like this style, but it’s definitely not what I wanted or expected. I never write reviews but I was compelled to write this one"
2.0,I’m not sure if the PJS fit because I didn’t end up trying them on. They came with a very strong chemical smell and didn’t even want to put them in my washer. I gave this item 2 stars because the PJS were really cute but I just couldn’t get over that smell.
2.0,"I know it says oversized, but my face is a bit bigger than most so I need bigger glasses to accommodate.  They are, however, comically oversized.  They feel like they're part of a costume. The cat-eye is a lot more dramatic in person, extremely pointy. Not realistic for every day wear."
2.0,Fell apart after a few times wearing
2.0,CHEAP Worn 3 times and the liner has ripped!
2.0,quality was poor despite a very pretty array of colors.
2.0,"I usually wear a size 6. I got the 5-6 size in this slipper, but they are already pretty loose. They are fine if I move casually around the house, but if I have to rush at all, my foot slips out of them to the point that I could loose my footing. The padding on the bottom is not substantial, so if I stand/walk around too long on hardwoods in them (which is most of my house), my feet/legs start to notice after awhile. They’re cute though & keep my feet warm."
2.0,Queda apretado en los brazos
2.0,i ordered a 1XL fits more like a smedium the sleeves were nice and so was the stitching it just didnt not fit at all
2.0,I loved these pants but the second i washed them and hung them to dry they shrunk terribly!
2.0,This dress fits strange and it arrived with a very strong smell. I wish it had fit like the pictures but the cut seemed off. The smell was very strong incense but not good smelling .
2.0,Not impressed with this item.You can actually see through the stitches holes.<br />And the handles could definitely be a little longer..<br />I will give it away because I'm not up for the hassle of returning it..
2.0,"There were three black lines on the back of jacket. I thought it was so dirty. I washed it. But the marks are still there. It is white jacket... since I washed it, I have no choice to return."
2.0,"The fit was ok, kind of short and fatter. The material it’s made out of sucks, the first and only time I wore it, by the end of the day I had probably 10 snags in it. I work at a desk all day, so I’m not hard on my clothes. Then the big mistake, I accidentally dried it, and it shrunk about 5 sizes, and now looks like it’s for a kid."
2.0,"Much smaller than expected, so I exchanged for the next larger size. That shirt was the same or even a bit smaller than the first one. Sent both back. I read the reviews and the sizing chart, both way off."
2.0,Bought a size  large for my son who is 6'2&#34; and165 lb. after reading reviews.  The material is fabulous but the length was way too short.  I am a 5'6&#34; 135 lb woman and the pants fit me perfectly.  They run very small.  I will be keeping them for myself because they are so comfy.  They are also very slender fitting.  Not baggy at all.
2.0,there is a lump on the arch part of the shoe. I suppose it is for arch support but it is not comfortable.
2.0,"I had high hopes starting with when I ordered it on 10/25/2020... TODAY, I received it 12/14/2020.... OF COURSE you're charged when you order this stuff. Anyway, I should have been more diligent and figuring out it was coming from China... i.e., TOOK FOREVER. Long story short, it finally arrived today and is average construction. I had hoped it would be a little lighter weight than it turned out...BUT MOSTLY, when I zip it up it is too snug around the hips.  I typically wear a size 10/12 and so ordered this zip in a ""L""... it fits fairly well everywhere except around the hips. Really not that comfortable to zip it up as too tight at hips... the rest of it is large... but hips insufficient."
2.0,The hat works great when i work out or run in the cold as far as listening to my music.  It does not work well if used as a bluetooth phone.  Sends feedback to the other end of the phone.  It is warm and useful for music though. If they get the phone portion worked out this will be top notch!
2.0,Rough feel around edges of the bracelet band.  Totally diminishes value.  Very dissapointed.  Usually I am very pleased with Kenneth Cole Watches..made this one feel like a black market knock-off?
2.0,"They work great, however one of the clamps broke in less than a week, it just fell apart unexpetandely. Definitely not worth the $10 for something that doesn't hold up for more than a week."
2.0,"I am usually a small to a medium and I do not particularly like the fit of this dress.  The arms are definitely too tight and I do not like the fabric at all but its for Christmas so I'll make it work, wouldn't recommend"
2.0,"I bought this for my son as a gift, so I held onto it for awhile so this is partially my fault because I did not get to the post office within the 30 day return period.<br /><br />He was so excited and really liked the watch.  He was wearing it one day and it popped off.  He is only 6 and it is definitely not too tight for him.  I fixed it and then it happened again.  Very disappointed and now I have a watch that does not work that is past the return date. :(<br /><br />Also, it states day and week but it actually shows the month and day?  This is difficult to explain to a 6 year old whom you are trying to teach time and months, days, years, etc.<br /><br />Very appealing to the eye but how can a detail like that be missed?"
2.0,First day that I wore them they lasted all night and when I went to wear them the second time my heel broke before leaving out thank God I wasn’t outside at this point the color itself is very cute and the shoe was actually comfortable but the quality is really cheap. I’m 5ft 1 in and weight 150. I mean I’m not that big for my heel to come off.
2.0,"These have no stretch and definitely are not ""magic gloves"". I am very disappointed in this product and I do not recommend the to anyone!"
2.0,Glasses came missing the nose piece and they wont stay up on my face! Irritated! Needed them for today so its no point of returning
2.0,Way too big and cheap looking:(
2.0,These socks are very thin and see through. I was not impressed.
2.0,Sizes run way too small. 34 fit like a 30.
2.0,"Runs very small...I usually take a large, but I ordered 2xl, & it is still tight...it will cost me too much to return it, so I'm stuck with it....there is also an odor!"
2.0,"Doesn't hold up so well after a wash or two. My ties in the back are already starting to fray and the colors are fading quickly. It's a nice thick fabric, however."
2.0,Wish i ordered a size down
2.0,"I had previously (about 2 years ago) bought Kalon hipsters and was very satisficed with them. However, when I ordered them again now (Sep 2021) I was disappointed: the size is noticeably smaller than the previous orders, the material is thinner and not as comfortable, and the seamlines are not as smooth. Based on my last order, I would say these are no longer a good buy - they are much too expensive for quality as low as Walmart's hipsters."
2.0,Their aid says it will fit large to extra large but it is not true.  The one I received was more like a medium but the tag indicated L/XL.
2.0,These pants were too long and tight in the legs.Very Bad Fit!!
2.0,I do not remember reading anywhere that this dress would be dry clean only. I was looking for something simple and easy to throw on and wash. The fit was almost what I expected except the top was too tight especially in the arms and chest.
2.0,The tummy control area was loose . Didn’t have different fabric to hold or control anything . Felt the same as rest of the leggings . Just leggings . Not tummy control at all
2.0,I dislike that the color of the bangle is much whiter than the picture.
2.0,"This hat is weird, but still wearable. The smiley is cute, but while the hat is adjustable, its kind of hard to fix, and its too big. Also, the picture is deceiving, there are words on the sides of the hat that say &#34;Gimme&#34; and &#34;faith&#34; and I'm not sure what that means."
2.0,"My grandson loved it, but what young boy wouldn't.  Too big."
2.0,Super comfy and fit great but it sheds EVERYWHERE.
2.0,They run a size smaller than a regular size
2.0,Top  does not look like picture.  Poor quality .  Pockets are fake.  This material and you could see my Colored t-shirt underneath .
2.0,"Disappointed with this scarf. The material is very stiff, more like priest's stole than a scarf."
2.0,This was too small I ordered 3 sizes up. product it self was fine but size is not accurate at all even after following others suggestions to order larger size.
2.0,"This case is super cute and efficent - but the elastic bands pop out a lot and fray and after only a little while I've had one fray completly and make 1/2 of the case un-usable. Very pretty to look at and good if you drop things but...a bummer b/c I was hoping this would be my new ""wallet"""
2.0,"Straight out of the box the wallet was very scratched and obviously used. This was disappointing for 2 reasons. The second reason is that I bought this wallet with carbon fiber hoping that it would not be as easily scratched as a painted model. Either it only looks like carbon fiber or I was just too optimistic. Clearly if you want to carry this wallet in your front pocket along with your keys you can expect it to get quite scratched very quickly.<br /><br />This being my first card holder I put a few cards in it to determine if it would serve my needs. I put 7 cards in and it felt like it was getting thick enough that I probably wouldn't want many more than that. Getting individual cards in and out is challenging, obviously due to the raised lettering on credit cards. Perhaps with practice I wouldn't mind but it's hard to say at first use.<br /><br />I am debating whether I will returning this wallet or not."
2.0,"These Sannysis Silvering Rhinestone earrings are not what I expected. They are very small and really not worth the trouble of ordering. They may work for a small child, Do not recommend these unless you are buying for a small child!"
2.0,Too small. Ordered 1/2 but the inner part of the plugs are smaller than 1/2&#34;.
2.0,Not comfortable Hard to put on foot
2.0,"The glasses were comfortable, but there was a ghosting effect that made them unusable for long term use.  The lens quality just isn't there on these."
2.0,"I read the reviews about the discoloration of the lace but saw the pictures and thought “it’s manageable and it’s not gonna bother me” but when I got it, the chains were broken and the discoloration was a big difference and unfortunately it did matter. I’m sad I won’t get to wear this for my anniversary dinner. The advertisement shows that the lace is the same color as the chain but when you get it, the lace is a washed out mustard/green color and the chains like I said came broken."
2.0,"Despite the beautiful colors and design, these earrings are poorly made. I had to reset and reposition  the bottom half of the earring multiple times within an hour. They would cross at the top and flip at the bottom. I wore the earrings to a formal dinner where I was not making significant movements. Due to the quality and inability for the earrings to stay in place, I would not recommend this set."
2.0,"The fabric is heavy and somewhat course for a dress shirt, which was surprising but not problematic. The color is gorgeous.<br /><br />I followed their sizing guide and had great difficulty buttoning the nice but tiny button over the chest. It was so small that it gave a sausage tube effect across the chest. Scared of the buttons popping off from the pressure, I quickly (though not easily with the whole tiny button under high pressure thing) took it off for a return."
2.0,Upset that one of the little rubber pieces that rest the glasses were missing. Uncomfortable to wear but they are stylish
2.0,Loved these until they ripped after the first use
2.0,"I got this 6 month ago,  I have used  four times, maybe 2 or 3 hours each with my sunglasses.  It has scratches,  the Velcro used to wear on your belt did not support correctly.  I am a mature person, that mean I do not wear on extreme situations. Do not purchase it."
2.0,The material was very cheap but for the price I guess it's what you pay for
2.0,Returned dress.  Nice dress but did not work for mr.
2.0,Poorly made.  Cracks when adjusting brim.  Would not buy again from this manufacturer. Socks were ok!
2.0,size not correct and shoddy workmanship
2.0,"These were okay, but the material was so sheer they offered no support or the coverage I was hoping for under my sheer dress. They were soft and easy to pack, but they were on the small side. I really only needed the one, in hindsight I should have spent the money on a single better made slip. Live and learn."
2.0,"They were heavy and discolored, Not quite what I expected."
2.0,"The thighs and calves fit great, but the waistband was huge! I constantly have to pull them up"
2.0,It a very cute dress but it runs small
2.0,Sizing was very hard.  I chose one 1 size up and still did not fit.<br />Great color!!
2.0,Runs a little big. I would not buy this dress again or recommend it to anyone. The material looks very cheap in person.
2.0,Fun idea. Not practical at all and doesn’t fit well. And they are not polarized
2.0,This product fits small
2.0,The earrings were much bigger than we're shown. That is the main reason that I do not like them. If they were nickel-sized that would have been much better.
2.0,"Fit well and feel nice, but these are see through. Can’t where in public. So bad review on my end."
2.0,cheap cheap cheap !! sent back too short and too small and too cheaply made
2.0,"The back of the ring started to change color, after only wearing it twice."
2.0,"I liked the materials, construction is good.<br />Easy to change.<br />The one complaint I have is that in the bag says the correct size, the one I ordered. But the piece is the next size up.<br />I measured against the three other buckles for the same watch and they fit perfectly. Only this one doesn't.<br />The band in the picture comes with a chromed one, which clashes with the triple matte black of my Fossil Latitude HR.<br />That's the whole reason for buying this one.<br />It's not the end of the world or anything. Just that it woulda look really good in my opinion.<br />Hope this helps."
2.0,Gave it to the Goodwill
2.0,I will be donating these to someone smaller than me.  There is nothing wrong with these panty hose; I am just too big for them.
2.0,Purchased and extra large because I wasn't sure of how it would fit. I typically wear a large. Received the jumper and it is very thin. You can see right through the material. No lining inside. Because I'm short (5ft) the holes for the knee do not line up. I thought there was elastic around the bottom (like joggers) from looking at the picture but it is straight leg...kinda wide. I'm disappointed because it is a cute jumper and it didn't look as I had expected. I may inquire with my neighborhood dry cleaner to see if they can make it better for a reasonable price.
2.0,"The gold balls are beautiful, but the Silicone backs are extremely difficult to hold in position to slide onto the posts. Young, nimble fingers might find this quite easy, but for my older, arthritic fingers, it was very frustrating."
2.0,El diseño es lindo y queda muy bien al cuerpo pero la calidad de la tela es mala
2.0,"The posts are not silver, they are black as well as the back of the earrings. Can’t see it as long as I keep the backs pushed in, but I guess this explains the cost being so low."
2.0,Looks like child jewelry
2.0,"why is it so hard to find a loose workout shirt that is longish and not a million dollars? I had high high hopes for these. Shipping was really slow, took weeks. THen it comes, I got an extra large and its tight, short, and shows all the things. I'm super sad about this. it shouldn't be this hard, and it shouldn't be so different than as pictured. I'd say it runs about two sizes smaller than it claims , so be careful if you dare to try these. Back to the drawing board for me I guess..."
2.0,Of course I washed this before wearing. It shrank and was very small. Luckily my workout partner is a very small person and I passed it along to her rather than returning it.
2.0,Nice style fit just right but zipper broke after couple of hours
2.0,nice my daughter love them
2.0,"I got this for my daughter and she loved it. I did notice when the necklace came that the necklace it self isnt a chain, it was just a black string with a twist thing instead of a clasp to keep the necklace together, but she liked it anyways. The pendant keeps falling off & the twist comes undone very easily. Over all I'm not impressed."
2.0,"My daughter was so excited for it to arrive, and it looks very cool.  She received lots of compliments, but after just two weeks, two of the zippers have broken and it is now useless.  Her bags from Walmart outlast this one.  Very disappointed because this was what she saved her up her own money to buy and is now very let down."
2.0,"Didn't like the fabric/material, too see-through, ran a little small. Re-ordered with different brand, and perfect."
2.0,The fit is too wide.
2.0,"This thing was way bigger than I expected. It was more like a maternity shirt than anything. The color was a nice black, but I'm not sure where I'll ever be able to wear it other than for cleaning around the house."
2.0,I didn’t like the style the pic didn’t not look like it looked in person.
2.0,"Absolutely awesome, comfortable, light, be careful on wet surfaces as they don't have too much grip there<br /><br />UPDATE Sep/03/2018: Shoes glue that joins outsole to leather is not good at all and separates, it seems to be a problem on quantity applied since some sections are strongly glued together while others aren't"
2.0,"It looks like the picture and it fits well, but it is a see through as can be. Did not even have to bend over or do a squat and my husband knew exactly what kind of underwear I had on."
2.0,Much longer than expected also color wasn’t what I expected
2.0,The material is not good.  Weird and shiny.
2.0,I was a not impressed with this product..
2.0,"I have a 6 5/8 hat size these head bands are too tight, can not wear them."
2.0,I purchased the black leggings by themselves first to make sure I liked them. They worked fine--I still wear them regularly. I thought the multi-color pack of 6 would be of equal quality but they are not. I went through 3 leggings in 2 hours each and never even left the house before snagging a run and ruining them. I wasn't playing rough or anything. Pantyhose lasts longer than these did.
2.0,"While the color and style were accurate the fit of the shirt didn't work well for me. If you are large chested this is not the shirt for you. This was a poor fit in the chest. It was too tight and the buttons were stretched, making it unwearable."
2.0,Way too small and the collar is poorly finished
2.0,"This is one of those suits that would be better sold as separates.  The top could benefit from some underwire construction to make the most of the sheer cut out design. I am a 36 B, and while I was definitely well contained in the suit, I felt the strategic cut out wasn't enough to give a similar look to the models- if anything, the slat of the cups placement served to flatten, not flatter.  The bottom was nice, but here again, I could have used a smaller size to make the most of the cut out design than what came with my top.  I sent this back."
2.0,The charms feel off.
2.0,"The idea of the sunglasses was quite cool - kind of like photochromic sunglasses but with manually adjustable darkness.  This was achieved via the passing of an electric current via the layer of Tin Indium Oxide that's sandwiched between the polarised lens.  Unfortunately, despite gentle handling, one of the lenses cracked within 2 weeks.  Oh well, at least it came in a nice sturdy case that I could recycle for use with my Oakley sunglasses."
2.0,"It’s a little smaller than expected, and also looks awful on me so I returned. The material felt scratchy and I just wasn’t feeling it."
2.0,Didnt like the scrunchy material on the sides and it runs big
2.0,Just not very comfortable.... fit not great... too large
2.0,Poorly made & ripped first day my daughter was wearing it
2.0,Fun design but material seemed low quality and size ran small.
2.0,"The lenses were too thin for the frame and did not fit well. Definitely thinner than the original lenses by a good amount and There were small gaps around between some of the corners of the lenses and the frame. Tightening them down didn't help and the lenses could be popped out with minimal effort. I don't know if I got a bad set or what, but I ended up returning and just trashing the sunglasses."
2.0,"Update: I have worn this for about 6 months. It is wearing off, I want to say after the first month of wearing it started, which is super unfortunate!<br />I get lots of compliments from watch side because it is still beautiful when viewing when looking at the watch but it is horrible with wear."
2.0,Although the earrings are &#34;sterling silver&#34; they are cheaply made. I didn't even bother wearing them because they look so cheap. I guess for the price what can you expect.
2.0,I am 5'7&#34; and it was sooooo short. It doesn't even cover my bum. I can wear with leggings and looks ok.
2.0,Bought 2 pair.  Way too small and narrow.  I wear a size 10.  I ordered size 11.  Too bad rubber does not stretch.
2.0,Way too small for XXL.
2.0,"Cheaply made, flimsy and too small!"
2.0,"This product is not worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- lightweight<br />- good ventilation<br />- good fit<br /><br />Cons:<br />- pricey for the assembly/material<br />- poor paint job on the shapes<br />- no lining or mesh on the inside so you can clearly see a face behind the mask in normal ambient lightning<br />- all plastic design, no reinforcement"
2.0,"Very disappointed because the dress is very cute, but it didn’t fit. I am a size 18/20 and I got the largest size and it looked like a size 10. very disappointed."
2.0,"The dress had a strong smell of bleach and chemical. Even after washing my hands with soap, the smell did not go away."
2.0,"Cute dress, I just wish it had more material.  Looks more like a slip."
2.0,This swimsuit is only for a shorter person.  My wife is 5'9&#34; tall and She could not even get the strap over her shoulder.
2.0,I returned this shirt it looked strange on me. The fabric was nice and thick though.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this top, the style and cut are nice but the material is so cheap and thin that it’s completely see through. I’m 5’4” and 120lb and the small fit okay but not as loose as I usually like. Would have been good if the material was thicker."
2.0,One broke the first time I used it.
2.0,Their head size was incredibly small. When I gave these to use for selfies at a fundraising golf tournament they had to use hair pins to hold them in place. They need to make the party fits of your head a lot bigger.
2.0,"Material was wonderful, but this item does run a tad bit small. I would recommend sizing up because the sleeves were very short and uncomfortable."
2.0,leaks when swimming
2.0,Bought for work stopped working after a couple days atleast the battery pack it came with works well lol
2.0,Mych smaller than expected
2.0,"I read an article recommending KN94 masks and thought I would give these a try but they are no better than the blue surgical masks, which are fairly useless in providing  protection from the coronavirus, except that they offer a better fit."
2.0,"it was too big, it wouldn't stay on any wrist I know of, only useful as carrying ."
2.0,"I have small wrists and this barely fit. It's tiny, too small for average adult."
2.0,Poor quality material that looks and feels cheap. These shoes feel awkward when you walk.
2.0,The shirt was very cute but way to big for a size small I had to send it ba k
2.0,Cute pattern. Poor ctaftsmanship
2.0,The band broke!
2.0,"Got a 3x as a sample for an adult dance class, and...it fits like a 1x at best.  Otherwise, really cute"
2.0,This item is cheaply made and arrived already broken. The colors are beautiful. But the metal is cheap.
2.0,cheaply made but they are comfortable. will not wear them out for fear of falling apart. will not buy again.
2.0,"Whereas they're beautiful and are indeed stylish, the earrings can and will leave your ears turning green after leaving them in for a while."
2.0,it was not to my expectation it was too small.
2.0,This outfit was not the color it was supposed to be. It was more of a yellow than a beige.  The pants fitted but the top was too big.
2.0,cheap fabrics
2.0,"Awful fit, very small pouch, the back is not comfortable."
2.0,"It’s really pretty, but I’ve only been wearing it for a little while and it’s already rusting. The rose “petals” are also falling off :("
2.0,The quality is not on par with the price. There is the same design and material sweater at Sam's Club for half the price.
2.0,there are no instruction how to set the watch
2.0,The glasses helped slightly with night glare but were not as good as I had hoped.
2.0,After I put it in the washer it grabbed every piece of lint and I couldn’t get it off. Frustrated.
2.0,The front neckline is a zipper. This is not shown in the images.
2.0,It was cute!
2.0,the material is transparent and shows the underwear. Very large underarm openings
2.0,this shirt had a faux pocket
2.0,Runs small. Like junior sizes
2.0,"This product is cute enough, but it badly fuzzed in very conspicuous areas the first time it was washed, even though it was in a garment bag for added protection in the delicate cycle. There's also a conspicuous snag. I've only worn the sweater 3 times and am trying to salvage it, but it may be hopeless.<br /><br />For sizing purposes: I'm 5' 5-1/2"", ~160 lbs. Curvy body type, 38D bust. Bought the XL & it fit perfectly- form-fitting as intended by the cut, but not tight. I have broad shoulders & long arms & was delighted over the long sleeves not stopping above my wrists."
2.0,I was so excited about this dress until I got it in the mail. The fabrics are two different blacks. You wouldn’t think it would be that noticeable but it is to me. It’s very comfortable and flattering AND has pockets which made it very hard to return but the OCD in me can’t handle the different black colors.
2.0,"I thought this was a great idea but very poor execution. The toe separators are way too thick, making these stockings difficult to put on and uncomfortable to wear. I liked the rest of the compression stocking well enough, except that it was much too tight at the top. I couldn't even get it over my knees. Also, it seems like the compression is in bands rather than being a continuous graduation from foot to top."
2.0,"Yikes. Everyone else has photos of it looking a lot more flowy than it really is. This is super scratchy, gross, cheap fabric that is super duper poofy.  Like the kind of fabric you'd use when making a kids dance recital costume, the stiff, hard, holds its shape tooling. NOT like the type of fabric you'd get if you were buying a bridesmaid dress. I was going to wear this to a wedding, but I'd be too scared I would have a poofier dress than the bride. The champagne color is also more of a yellow orange than a tan (the lighting when I took these pics was really dark, but in the brighter light it's pretty damn yellow/orange). I thought maybe it was just me, and so all three of the people I showed agreed that it needed to go back ASAP. If you're looking for a really poofy princess skirt I guess this would work, but as a 25 year old going to a wedding as a guest, naaahhhh. I even tried to flip it inside out, but it was still incredibly poofy. The length was perfect though, I'm 5' 4&#34; 145lbs. I guess it depends what you're trying to wear it for."
2.0,"It is a soft dress, that’s why it gets two stars & not one. The straps are very awkward & hit at a awkward place. I would look for something different."
2.0,Cute but!<br />Opened up the little plastic package the dress came in and nothing but a wrinkled mess!<br />Sending back!
2.0,Too small. Difficult for my 11 year old and 7 year old to put on by themselves. They say it hurts
2.0,"My daughter liked it , very pretty . She wished it was longer it doesn’t look like the picture on Amazon<br />Nice color , made well ."
2.0,"Works well, waaaay heavier than I hoped."
2.0,"Love how this feel but the quality is not the best. It could ave been sewn better. Stitching is not straight and the elastic band  is exposed. It’s a lounge around the house, drop my kid off at school and come straight home dress.  I would not wear this to any sort of special event or even running errands where I need to get out of the car.<br /><br />Beware: SUPER STRONG CHEMICAL smell that caused my airways to close up on me. I have a history of asthma. I had to put on a mask to wash the dresses and open several windows just to get my house to air out. At one point, I was breathing so badly, I thought I was going to have to go to the ER.  Suggest opening your package outside and letting the dress air out before bringing it in your house."
2.0,Missing comfort big time- the visor rim has a cardboard lip (at) the scalp taking away an expected soft snug feeling -
2.0,The dress was just to big.  The chest was Ok but even with heels I was tripping.
2.0,Cute but got bent easily by a 3 year old. He used to love my umbrella which was built very well and $4 cheaper but this one is not strongly built.
2.0,"This dress will be returned! It is smaller and much longer than expected,Sorry I ordered it!!!! Love the color and material but not for me!"
2.0,Did not like. Returned.
2.0,Color not accurate at all. Supposd to be Cactus Flower as pctured. Came in Red and was clearly labeled red on the tag. Checkung the sku number with provider they said it was right - said Amazon posted it wrong. Never order from them again
2.0,It's ok nothing special but also not a terrible hat
2.0,I bought this for an all white party I will be attending.  The description said white.  However it is definitely NOT white.  It is an off white/ ivory color.  The material is thin & the fit is snug.  I wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:a352c614c63d4fb2d6e58fa943d8d9a1]] Product arrived and seems soft and comfy however see video… as I tried to remove the wax paper it melted to the vinyl (?)<br />Ruining the shirt
2.0,I loved the feel of the dress but the fabric was so sheer you could see every flaw!
2.0,"I would love to know who decided that women's cardigans needed these slits on the sides. I absolutely hate them. This cardigan would have a nice flattering drape if it didn't have a rounded hemline with large slits on each side. All it does it separate and emphasize my hips and rear which is what most women are trying to camouflage with a longer cardigan.  They recommend wearing this with leggings or jeggings, but the slits on the sides leave the most vulnerable parts of your body exposed. The cardigan is also very see-through. I tried it on with a white Tshirt and black leggings and you could see exactly where one ends and the other begins because its so transparent. The stock photo has to be touched up or photoshop because the way its presented is not at all how it looks. Everything about this was a huge letdown."
2.0,I originally bought it for a work Christmas party but it was way too tight and way way too short. The length was more of a long shirt feel. I have returned item.
2.0,"Stone is like plastic, arrived with deep scratches in it. Metal is sterling silver, but very thin and bends easily. It wasn’t expensive but I expected a little bit more than what I got, not worth returning hassle but I won’t be wearing it<br />Also won’t be buying from this company again."
2.0,"These will do the job of keeping your feet warm, and they're fairly comfortable.  They tend to slip down easily and they bunch up underfoot a little bit when walking.  However, the biggest problem is that there's virtually no quality control before they're stuck in a package.  One pair was 3 full inches longer than the second pair, and worse than that, the top of that pair was unfinished with just a lot of loose threads and the inside cotton loose around the top.  I don't recommend these, especially because there are good quality products elsewhere.<br /><br />Edited:  After a few days, the seller contacted me offering a refund and stating: ""will ask our supplier to check more carefully to avoid such quality issue."""
2.0,"The shirt is a very cute and flowy idea. However, it came damaged and the sizing is very inaccurate.<br /><br />My daughter is an XL/XXL and this was still too big on her. The exposed shoulder side came down below her armpit. I'm a L/XL and the shirt just falls off of me.<br /><br />There were stitching mistakes on 3 separate areas of the shirt."
2.0,Will not hang right or long enough if you're curvy
2.0,The floor fell off after about 5 or 6 wears
2.0,It’s hard to breathe!
2.0,i ordered 2 one as a gift and one came broken so i returned it and the other i've been wearing for a couple weeks and the band seems like its about to break
2.0,Not what I thought I was ordering at all.
2.0,doesn't fit on the ear well at all. was not pleased
2.0,I found the lace to be flimsy. Returned.
2.0,Not great too big
2.0,They are not the real Beatles !
2.0,It broke after one hours of use
2.0,They looked like knock offs.
2.0,Red is much more tangerine orange
2.0,"a little see through, also a little smaller than i expected but will work just fine for lounging around the house."
2.0,I bought this 2 times and this didn't fit me and I don't understand why
2.0,It's very pretty but it doesn't stay to your fit. It loosens very easily.
2.0,"I've had a pair similar to this before, but these just allow too much cold air in.  The hole in the thumbs sounds cool for texting, but when you have to clear snow of your car it's miserable.  They don't work for walking my dog either; when your hand is curled the top flap isn't tight enough and allows cold are in.  The material is good, although my velcro started coming off the third time I wore them.  They look nice, I just wish they worked better.  If you never have to clear snow or walk a dog they should be fine for you."
2.0,"I've been using this wallet for a few months.  I am a vegetarian so I utilize wallets from man-made materials.  I thought it was cool to try one made from bike tires (I am an avid road cyclist!).  Great idea but when I am taking my wallet out to purchase things it makes my hands smell like rubber, the same as after changing a tube on my bike.  Hands that smell like rubber when out with friends at a restaurant - not so good.  Perhaps in future editions of the product something can be done to treat or seal the bike tire materials?"
2.0,"I like the overall look and feel of these, not too heavy. Unfortunately they are a strange darker gold that look very brassy and cheap."
2.0,"Other reviews mentioned smell, so I thought that meant leather smell. I love the smell of leather so I was excited to receive this bag. After it arrived: Very little leather smell and LOTS of chemical/glue smell.  No label stating genuine leather. I think it is just cheap leather or leather like product glued onto suede.  Very disappointing. Cute design, but handles are not large enough to loop around elbow. I am returning this item."
2.0,"The print on this dress was cute, fit was flattering, material was awful. I could not even get past it to keep it. Unbreathable, almost rubbery."
2.0,"The plastic clear window will not allow me to touch my phone to see time or mute a call.  I loved the one I bought last year. I have to<br />Use it , though it is worn. The phone also sticks to this plastic window making it difficult to retrieve my phone when it rings. I love the cards slots! Last year model didn’t have them."
2.0,This was a strange material and also came damaged with stitching hanging out the side of it. Returning item!
2.0,"I don't know if this is really genuine leather, any help?"
2.0,"I’ve ordered a couple of these in different colors, and despite ordering the same size, all of them fit differently. This fit like an entire size larger than the Grey , and was shapeless and baggy."
2.0,These socks are very thin I can see my toes through the material
2.0,"I bought these because I love tiger eye stones. I also love big cats, I figured if some of the proceeds help them great. The quality on the hand isn't good at all. Still happy to donate to such a great effort."
2.0,"This not what I expected from Spanx. The straps are skinny and I can’t adjust them enough, so they’re too long. Really, I wouldn’t buy this if your a c or larger unless you just want it for sleeping! Too expensive for the quality."
2.0,"I ordered the 36DD, the bra/top part fits perfect, however I'd have to be a size 8/10 around the middle (and I'm not) for this to fit me the way it fits in the picture.  It's not loose - it's very form fitted.  I am very disappointed because I really like this top and it's made of good solid quality materials and actually provides support up top - which is darn near impossible to find in a swim top, but the average 36DD woman is not built like the model and I should've known better.  It's going back."
2.0,I wear between a 6 and a 6.5. They were a little big so I put inserts in and now they're big again so maybe they stretch. I wouldn't buy again. They got dirty pretty quickly too
2.0,"Because of sizing variations and my need for a particular type of pockets, I ordered several different brands of yoga pants. These were the most expensive of the bunch by a long shot. And I upsized because I didn't want them to be quite as snug as yoga pants usually are. Thes were the ones I had the highest hopes for, but was quite disappointed. My 2XL is a lot more like a M or L. Way too small! The other 4 pairs are either slightly or way too big. Such a shame because it's hard to find ones with the shorter inseam (I'm 5'1"") and just the right pockets.  Nice job making me feel even fatter than I am, YogiPlace!!"
2.0,This is a cheap Chinese product. Poorly made -fits poorly
2.0,"It does not fit right at all. One side has too much fabric and the other, not enough. It looks really pretty in the pictures, but does not look like it at all, at home. I was pretty bummed."
2.0,"I loved The dress, loved the fit, but when I washed it the dye bled and some polka dots look pink. Very bummed because I loved the dress."
2.0,I ended up giving it to a smaller friend.  Top is low cut and revealing.
2.0,This product is not accurate for 6ft or more men with body....but not fat. These were too tight and it's 2X.
2.0,Hairline crack the first day I had them.
2.0,Keep sliding of glasses.
2.0,Wore out quickly. Tears formed at seams
2.0,the photos of the boxers in the 6 pack and the individual photos are not the same. The inseam of the individual boxers shots are longer than what's in the 6 pack. I got the 6 pack boxers and you will look like an 80 year old man wearing them. They stretch and ride up everywhere.
2.0,This dress  was not amazi on me. I'm 5'7&#34; and it was above my ankle. I returned it.
2.0,Material is very thin.  Cannot wear without a slip. Runs small.
2.0,I typically wear an XL but got a 2X just to be safe and this was skin-tight.
2.0,It was an okay fit.
2.0,Really pretty ring... until it turns your finger green within hours of wearing it.  Super bummed.  Total waste of money.
2.0,"While this bra was pretty and the cups looked ok, it fit too loose. The strap's material was not supportive and it just sagged down."
2.0,No creo que sea realmente Nine West Adrienne por el material y el terminado de la cartera.Horrible zipper.
2.0,"I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs and the medium was way to big for my liking. It was cute but not for me! I returned it."
2.0,This turbin wasn’t the color green I was expecting.<br />It’s more of a traditional green apple green. Not what I was looking for....
2.0,The bracelet itself was of excellent quality and looked very nice. However the tool that was included so that I could remove the link in the comfort of my own home was not so simple. The little wire on the tool was bent and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't make it be straight and so I couldn't remove a link from the bracelet and had to send it back
2.0,Had some sparkle sticker on it to look like diamonds. Kinda cheap looking with the sticker. Would look alot better without the sticker
2.0,"La medida no es lo que pedí, trae repuestos pero sin instrucciones de cómo poder reparar, si no es conocedor de cómo  armar este tipo de prenda, no lo recomendaría. Gracias!"
2.0,"Band looks good, but the adapters do not fit squarely into the Apple watch. Too unstable. Decided to return it."
2.0,Not sure what’s up with Kenneth Cole sizing on amazon. My daughter is a slender size xs but this xs is way big on her. Even too big for my sister who wears size 4-6. It’s way too big
2.0,"The price was great, but after washing my hands a few times the color completely started to disappear and it is now faded and unwearable. It was a great price but unfortunately one of those “you get what you pay for” scenarios."
2.0,"The idea was nice but the execution was an epic fail. The split is in the middle, not on the side like the photo. The material feels thick like a curtain. Would not recommend wearing this in Texas heat; guaranteed to pass out. I really wanted to like it but...... No."
2.0,Too Bulky
2.0,They deliver on time or a little bit earlier I love 💕 them
2.0,"I purchased two sizes bigger and it still was too small. The material is great, but buy at least three sizes larger than what you wear."
2.0,This is a very large bag.  It is more like a tote
2.0,Much shorter than the one shown in the photo. Hip length. Can't wear with leggings. Should have sized up two more sizes for length
2.0,Stinks like fish.  Like it was made in China and sat on a fishing dock for 6 months.  The stench is horrible.  Cute bag other than that.  But wanted to retch every time I caught a whiff while I was out with it.
2.0,They were okay. The gold isn't really gold. It looks like a bronze. And one pair was very crooked. Really wouldn't recommend them
2.0,Its waaaay oranger than shown on the picture. I liked the color in the picture cus it looked like a pastel type orange. But its actually like halloween orange with black trimming on neck and arms. Not at all like the picture. And i believe I got a large and it was still too tight. I normally wear mediums.. Not cute. So I wear it for bed. LOL
2.0,It's an overpriced bag because someone feels the name is worth it.
2.0,They a a little too bulky
2.0,This jacket was very small in the body and very long in the sleeves. I tried it on and immediately packaged it up for return. Very disappointed!
2.0,How these shoes are cut makes it extremely difficult to get these boots on your child's foot. I tried for 10 minutes and then just decided to return them.
2.0,Looks cool....fits horrible. To tight. Junk is exposed. Water clings to the shorts become cold quick. Not my favorite. Shirt is cool. Gave that a high star.
2.0,I love the look of this shirt but I ordered a small and it was still huge!
2.0,I didn't know what vicose was when I ordered it - the sleeves are tight and it is like nylon. Cheap for what I was expecting
2.0,"Cute dress but very see thru. I ordered the grey and white and will be sending it back. For size reference I’m 5’4”, 275, 38JJ bust and I ordered the 3x."
2.0,"The label was glued on with strong sticky nasty glue.  I should have sent them back, but tried to clean off the glue.  After hours of fiddling, they were still sticky.  I didn't want any of the glue to get on other clothes or the washer/dryer, so I tossed the two worst ones.  The other two are OK, but they tend to creep down and wad up in my shoes when I walk.  'Daresay' brand fits better and has recyclable packaging."
2.0,The fit is wayyyyyy to small. I ordered the extra large and it fits like a child size large.
2.0,It's okay but not something that would catch my eye like it appeared online in photo
2.0,"The material wasn't bad and the shape would have been really cute except that it gaps weirdly around the arm holes (in a very noticeable fashion). I DO have a fairly large bust, not sure if this affected the way the dress fit in that area. It looked like it would accommodate my chest nicely from the photos and seeming. The color was as pictured and the length was right. Sadly, this was something I waited too long to return and then ended up donating."
2.0,1/2 the size shown and more clear than purple. One is more rough than the other. Not what I expected.
2.0,Meh the quality isn’t great.<br />It’s not very well shaped
2.0,I order the size I would  wear just in case and sized down one size and it was still too big. It is also sheer enough to see through. Sent them back.
2.0,"Very large, hoping it will shrink in the wash.  I'll follow up."
2.0,Cheap polyester fabric.  Sending it back.
2.0,"Shorts were good, shirt was dingy n doesn't match the lace on the shorts."
2.0,Really cheap. Arrived bent. Will be returning.
2.0,"Didn’t like the way the purse felt. Was a Christmas gift for my daughter. Looked like the straps were already frayed, and it was just purchased. Wouldn’t recommend. I found one similar at target. A couple dollars more a little bigger but better quality."
2.0,"I personally didn't care for these. The material is kind of bulky and just billows around my problem areas. If you're super thin and look good in most anything, go for it. If you are a little heavier and think these look comfy, like I did, my advice is to pass."
2.0,Dress was really pretty the color was perfect. But it’s slightly on the thin side and is see through. So I will only be wearing it at home.
2.0,Not as expected very cheaply made.
2.0,Fist time to use they split where the rubber meets the clear plastic at the top which caused water to seep in. Disappointing
2.0,The product is slightly flimsy. One piece the plastic connector from the hook to the stick separated. Also this cannot be put for those vehicles which has window visors installed. There is a major issue with this one. The hook which goes over the window glass scratches the glass... so in case if you have shade or window tint on the glasses that comes off. Looks nice but it fails on the utilization.
2.0,"The dress was oversized and shapeless, if you decide to order I would definitely get at least a size smaller; however it is also much shorter than I expected. I'm 5'5 and it comes to my knee."
2.0,These shorts only lasted me 2 weeks before they started to tear!!
2.0,Cute shoes but fit is small (order a full size up) and craftsmanship is shoddy...leather is cut pretty haphazardly.
2.0,"The clasp broke the first time I wore it! Tried to exchange, too much hassle! I loved it so I just purchased another one since the price was right!😉👍🏻‼️"
2.0,Not great quality. Super thin. I can only wear them to bed or around the house.
2.0,"I really liked the color of these lenses, but they didn't even come close to fitting properly. Big disappointment."
2.0,It's difficult to change the rings if you need to.  Had to change one side with a 2&#34; ring to hold a lot of keys.  The material is very tight to try and get the rings on and off.  The metal clip seems okay.  It's also a bit long.
2.0,Don’t like the quality and style in person
2.0,"Very shoddy construction. I had to put it together, very bad quality stones out of place."
2.0,"It was really cute, and I loved the flair of the skirt. The fabric is nice and heavy. It fit me wonderfully, however, and this is why I have it at 2 stars, after wearing it one time the zipper broke. I'd return it, but I've missed the window. If you're okay with sewing a new zipper into it then go for it, otherwise it's probably a waist of money."
2.0,"I am a 34B, (5'4&#34;, 135 lbs) and there's no way this Medium is even close to being sized correctly.<br />I struggled to get it on, and I was afraid I would tear it trying to take it off.  Once on, it was binding and extremely uncomfortable.<br />That being said, quality looked good.<br />If I wasn't worried about the reliability of how other sizes would fit, I would try another one in a Large.<br />Kudos to Amazon and the seller for allowing me to return this, but I think this is something I might just have to go to a brick and mortar store to try on and purchase."
2.0,"Cheap material, left glaps in the sides and fit poorly"
2.0,"bag is ok size as listed.  BUT it is NOT glitter.  Purchased this my grand daughter who loves glitter and sparkles.  This item has not glitter or shine, just printed star designs in the fabric.  VERY DISAPPOINTED."
2.0,"I bought these for my 5 month old baby and they didn't fit. They're only adjustable on one side so if they're  the shortest they'll go, you can't shorten the other side too. Bummer. Size 0-2 is false."
2.0,"I went by the size chart and found that technically it's correct if I want to wear my shirt tight, but I don't. I returned it."
2.0,Very very small more like four sizes smaller than stated. Very pretty.
2.0,I ordered these for my 13 year old. They were too long/big for her. These are adult sized earrings.....IMO. I returned them.
2.0,These are huge! Would not even stay on my 2 year old daughter's face for a second. I've put them away and will try again next year. They are very cute so I hope she can wear them in a year or two.
2.0,Maybe I am justa heavy breather or its not meant foe a petite face. The sides of the plastic window rubbed on my face and it not only fogged up. It fogged my glasses and created condensation inside the mask.
2.0,Buckle doesn’t stay buckled
2.0,"Alas, I did not. This is a box masquerading as a shirt. The shoulder seam hits mid-bicep and everything drapes from there. I refuse to see what my post-pandemic weight actually is, but as someone that just purchased their first 10/12s, sizing down to a small is clearly not the answer. And though I abhor anything form-fitting, I still prefer not to look like a sack of potatoes. Would return except A) I'm Lazy and, B) it admittedly does meet the current WFH dress code, which is basically Don't Be Naked."
2.0,The orange color is beautiful but the dress is made so poorly. The neck hole is huge and sat on my shoulders and made the top very baggy and weird. It’s very thin but not see through. It’s wrinkles VERY easilu
2.0,"The picture does not show the low quality of this product. I lost my money.  I tried to return it and I don`t know why, after some weeks, it came back to my mail-box!!"
2.0,Bottoms were perfect top was weird and didn't sit right the fabric sat too close and didn't have enough on the sides.
2.0,The product is a watch stop work before 6 mouth Gosasa Classic Face Unisex Women / Men Watch [Skmei] want buy this product again.
2.0,The fabric on these undershirts feels terrible. I should have expected this based on the price but they are just made out of a really cheap cotton that is scratchy against your skin.
2.0,"Bought this for my daughter. They look really nice. She loved wearing them, but after 3 weeks, the barbell came out of the setting and it can't be put back together. It looks like the two pieces were glued together rather than have one thread into the other."
2.0,Bottoms a size medium at best.
2.0,Way too big. Printing is high quality though.
2.0,"Functionally and comfortability wise this band is fine, but it is significantly smaller than I was expecting. I had on of these on my old Versa and it was perfect. But this one for the Charge I can just barely fit my hand through when it is unvelcroed and pulled out to the maximum size. I'm just an average size guy. Having to shimmy my hand in and out of this band would be a massive hassle every time I need to charge the watch. If you are on the smaller side this will be great, but if you are above 5' 8"" you shouldn't waste your money."
2.0,This dress was a joke. The arms are entirely too small. Even in the xl. Barbie arms.
2.0,"Just an okay handbag, very cheaply made"
2.0,They are flimsy and ugly. I wear them to do chores
2.0,This is really a child or woman's watch. It is a very small band and watch  head. The light doesn't really light up the face.
2.0,Very poor sewing and cheap looking. Will be returning it.
2.0,"Hate it. Runs true to size, is ordered a small. 5""6 125..  Thick but cheap material..."
2.0,"This blouse is pretty but not practical. Sent to dry cleaners because it's not meant for washing. Wore it once and the fabric ran. Waste of money,AND, the button holes were too small for the buttons to fit through....snagged the fabric when I tried to get the buttons into their holes."
2.0,I really wanted to make it work but the robe was just too long and the pockets were placed too low.<br />The top also didn’t fit well. No support for boobs. It could do with elastic band like the one on the waist. It is very soft but I had to return because not happy with the overall fit.
2.0,Didn't realize it was coming directly from China.  Cheap looking.
2.0,Size is really big and loose. Quality ok.
2.0,I ended up returning this sweatshirt. The look and feel was pretty but it was tight along the bottom and not flattering on me. Because it was tight fitting I would size up.
2.0,"Way too small band size, I can’t say anything about just as it wasn’t fitting. The shoulder straps are granny like too, not something you’d feel sexy in or at least I wouldn’t."
2.0,"I gave two stars because the belt used good material...But, the belt is useless because of size...You have to be kidding...? I'll not send them back, nor will I order again...Wasted my money! Not much, but it was a waste..."
2.0,You will attract and catch every piece of lint and pet hair wherever you go. Would have been cute but basically I use it for dusting since it’s a lint magnet.
2.0,The band was way too small for my wrist
2.0,"These are nice shorts - not super great, but nice, however the sizing is not at all accurate and I had to send them back.  Other reviews state they're right-sized, but I wear a 12 and had ordered the XL which is designated as a size 14 to 16 (wanted baggy shorts).  I could barely get them on."
2.0,I put it on my good sterling silver chain and it moves to the blank side all the time for show. Not too happy with this. Cheaply made for the price and shipping. Nice size tho!
2.0,"iStrap makes a Double Push Button Butterfly Deployment Clasp version of this.  Buy that one, the clasp is much nicer."
2.0,Barely long enough for seven eyelet Converse Allstar 70 low top.  Can’t tie double knot.  Don’t appear to be 100% cotton.  Disappointed
2.0,"I purposely got this watch for an elderly man who has a hard time seeing, but the numbers appear to be larger in the pictures then they actually are in person. My main concern though was that the face/background color is shown to be almost a peridot green, but it is really a shiny reflective gold which is something he is having trouble with. I’m returning. Also the numbers are not dark green they are black."
2.0,"These glasses look good and fit well, the lenses are clear. One of the pairs the lenses are a bit off so one eye is strained. But that's not why I'm going to have to return them. The nose pads smell awful!  And they are right on your nose so you can't not notice. The smell gets stronger as you wear them, presumably from the warmth. Nobody else has mentioned this, so I might assume it is an anomaly, and try to exchange them."
2.0,"they have 3 watch battieries in each one, and the lights are fun, but Many of the batteries are dead and they cannot be changed"
2.0,No mucho
2.0,Material is thin . Not great
2.0,These lenses are clear and contrast colors very well. The lens color is amber and extremely light. Does NOT block bright light. Also the mirror finish you can see directly through.
2.0,I really wanted to give these bras 5 stars but the line that goes down the middle is where my nipple is and makes an indent when you're wearing clothes.  Or boob wings if loosen the straps.. I wear a 34ddd so should be able to fill out any bra lol.. But they are pretty
2.0,Pip fell out after a few weeks<br />Seller offered 20% off next purchace
2.0,How come nothing comes in an extra small size?
2.0,Pretty but the post broke off and it’s too late to return it
2.0,I liked the looks at first when I ordered it but it fit so tight that even the back zipper won't go up. I was afraid of ripping it so I didn't even try zipping it. The dress fits as extra small instead of Medium.
2.0,Good looking glasses but no real sun protection.  I tried using them outside in the sun and found myself squinting.  Returned.
2.0,It's not worth the money
2.0,"They flash when charging, but not when you walk in them... I'm still planning to wear these for appropriate events though, just as funny silver shoes."
2.0,"This dress seemed perfect for my proportions. I'm 5'7"" 145lbs, 34DD and 26-27"" waist. I tried a Medium and the top was just too poofy. It was loose at the shoulders, and for some reason the right shoulder kinda stuck out like it had a shoulder pad. The upper back part was loose, too. The sleeves fell down a bit. I might try a small , but I'm pretty sure the waist would be too tight.<br /><br />I will say the red dress made me feel like I was in a mariachi band, so maybe i'll try the yellow in the future."
2.0,Feels cheaply made.  Does not seem like they will last very long.
2.0,"I love the design & the material (this is a lightweight hoodie - no fleece as noted in description).  I thought it would be perfect for my office ugly Christmas sweater party (especially being non-fleece), BUT unfortunately the sizing is more akin to a Junior sizing. :(  I ordered a 2XL/3XL and figured it would be roomy.  It is the complete opposite!  The sleeves are long enough & it fit well through the shoulders, but (OMG) NOT through the waist and hips - VERY figure forming in all the wrong places.  It is a longer hoodie which falls well over the hips.  I was going to send it back, but it fits my kid & she was excited to have her own ugly sweater.  I'll keep shopping..."
2.0,"I am 5'0&#34; and 135lbs. I bought a size 12. They fit ok but a bit on the looser side. I could've gone down to a 10 if I wanted it to hold my post baby belly in more. They really aren't &#34;shorts&#34; as they are listed, just a more generously cut bottom. I don't like to show my crotch area and these almost accentuated it because the rouging stops just above your crotch area. It's forgiving for the belly but I prefer the bottoms that have a separate layer on top to cover the crotch area. If you are a short girl like me, expect that these will go all the way up to the bottom of your bikini top leaving no space between the two pieces."
2.0,"Other than too small the button hole threading not clean, eventually it would unravel!!"
2.0,It's so cute but I know I  can't clean or sleep in it. Depends on what you are looking for. Not what I was expecting. But for
2.0,"These run one size small and are very light weight. I wouldn't wear them outside and inside I wear them with a wool sock. I bought these after my Baffin's wore out. It was a mistake. The Baffins are much better (true to size, warm and very comfortable."
2.0,"Cute socks but fit is inconsistent. I had a pair I ordered before and really liked them and they fit well. This order one pair I couldn’t even get on, one pair I got on but they were somewhat uncomfortable. Very disappointed"
2.0,They fit like they were made for a female's hand.  So tight I could barely make a fist. The same was tru for the small & the medium sizes.  The leather itself felt pretty good but the stitching especially on the finger tips was poorly sewn.
2.0,Icky grandma fabric.
2.0,"I bought these to help with headlight glare at night. Unfortunately, they did not make any difference"
2.0,"It's okay...the earring hook came bent the little round part on the top of the earring fell off, as I opened it..."
2.0,"While the color was as advertised, my handbag did not arrive with the tassel as expected."
2.0,"This is a nice looking watch, and syncs easily with your phone via bluetooth. I did not see the benefit here. To me it seems like a low end fitbit, only bigger, more manly, and pricier.<br />The thing I didn’t like the most was that it won’t do anything unless you log in to the app, and that requires giving up your password to either your email, facebook, or google account, and that is something I’m not willing to do. That said, I took a couple minutes and set up a dead end email account just for this phone and signed into the app. For the life of me I can’t figure out why it needs the info. To run it pairs through our Bluetooth with your phone. Why does it require access to your email or other accounts, other than to needlessly pry into your personal business. The app asks for permission to send you emails, but works fine if you decline, and has a setting you can set to communicate with friends, but neither of these 2 settings need passwords so why does the app require them?<br />Also the app kills the battery life on my IPhone 7. I got a fitbit for half the price that tracks more movements, keeps time just as well and doesn’t invade my privacy or kill my phone battery."
2.0,"These fit super snug and didn't fit my son. But the bigger draw back is they look cute online, but totally look weird and cheapy on his feet.  Too bad cause I was really excited for them."
2.0,Poor quality so I returned product
2.0,"I will sent this jacket back.  It's a bit snug, but also not up to my expectations.  It's very thin and flimsy compared to others and I don't think it will keep me very warm on a semi-cool day."
2.0,These posts are wayyyy too short to be of any use to me. Additionally they keep unscrewing whenever I clean my ears/face. They are really poorly designed and I regret thinking I could keep them and find another use for them. The only good thing about them is that they really are surgical steel and did not provoke a reaction with my nickel allergy.
2.0,The XXL size runs small.  I would not have purchased it had I known it would not fit right.
2.0,I purchased them classes for a fishing trip to aid in looking through the water. If they are polarized it is nothing like they should be. They very comfortable and great that they dont' have the little nose pieces that usually get stuck in my hair if I move the glasses up on my head.
2.0,Beautiful shoe but very uncomfortable! Great price!
2.0,"The earrings really are gorgeous, but my piercings on BOTH ears are infected after wearing them and were bleeding when I removed the earrings.<br /><br />I've had my ears pierced for 19 years and cleaned the earrings with rubbing alcohol prior to putting them in. Maybe it has something to do with the weird thick plastic backs that came with the earrings? I'll try wearing them with different backs once the infections have cleared up."
2.0,Material is the kind that snags easily and gets runs much like pantyhose
2.0,had a run in the material when taken our of packaging
2.0,Not a great fit will return item
2.0,I'm sure for someone who might be a size 8 this could actually work.  I bought a 2X and am normally a size 12/14 and couldn't even unlace the ribbon enough to make it work.  It looks really pretty though.
2.0,I've had this for maybe 2 months and it started rusting.
2.0,"For reference I'm 135lbs, 34/29/38 and the large fit me. White is very very see through in the belly area because it's very thin. The cut is pretty though, the top part of it over the shoulder and breast area is not see through because the material is thicker.  I will just wear it with high waisted skirts and pants so people can't see my belly button."
2.0,I love the look BUT the metal turned/tarnished the first time I wore it.
2.0,"Support is great, however the band that hold rolls and makes uncomfortable"
2.0,"I ordered the light red scarf and what I got was a very brown scarf, nothing similar to the one pictured. Disappointing"
2.0,After wearing the band and taking on and off many times the band began to stretch out and lose its professionally woven look
2.0,"The print on the dress is fabulous but the fit is WAY too small on top.  It just gapes open, and I ordered based of the manufactures sizing guide.  It is also very sheer, you can definitely see everything through this dress.  Even though it's sheer, I probably would have kept it if it actually fit. It could work well as a bathing suit cover up or a robe as others have mentioned."
2.0,This dress was so much smaller than it was described. It is definitely not accurate. I was very Duda in the quality as well. It was thinner than expected.
2.0,"didn't really like it very cheap looking,.. ..heart charm larger then appears in pic. Although the price was cheap $11+, this looks like dollar store quality."
2.0,"Wanted the shirt as alternative for Renaissance Festival, got a larger size, but it's more like a Medium than an XL."
2.0,I needed the buckle too.
2.0,Fit very awkwardly
2.0,The necklace chain turned black after a month
2.0,"The material feels nice and is completely squat proof. I'm 5'2"" so they were a little long on me and the ankles were loose (I'd prefer they were long with bunching if the ankles were tight). The waist is high, but that didn't stop it from slipping down while I did a few yoga poses while trying them on. They also have elastic sewn into the top of the waist band and that's a real pet peeve of mine. Sadly, they're going back."
2.0,The bands were Quick Release pin capable....but for some reason they don't ship the QR pins.  BEWARE.
2.0,"I wear long box braids and was looking for a large bonnet. This was entirely too big. Unless you have heavy hair that stops at your ankles, this isn’t the bonnet for you. It was also tight around my hairline."
2.0,"Theses seem like very good shoes, but the insoles do not breathe .  This makes your feet feel and sweat as if they are in plastic bags."
2.0,"I've used several brands of 15-20mmHg compression socks...but these are by far the tightest of them.  I'm an ectomorph...5'11"", 160 lbs...so I'm kinda slim...and my legs are height/weight proportionate.<br />I purchased the LARGEST of the size options (L/XL), and I can barely slide the socks on.  So I can guarantee that anybody else larger than me isn't going to be able to fit into these socks.  Keep looking!  (you're welcome)"
2.0,Had it for about a week wore it twice and it's already turning colors.
2.0,Really? The arm holes are to open and big. It fits to snug and is way to short in the length!
2.0,"broke on first wearing and it is very rigid material, doesn't wrap around the wrist. But it is very cute."
2.0,Cheap hat no shape
2.0,"These didn’t seem to fit well at all. Simultaneously too short and too loose, they rode up and ended up feeling more like swim bottoms. The material feels thin and too stretchy for support. Guess you get what you pay for in this three pack."
2.0,"Good quality, elder futhark runes , unfortunately i only got 19 of the 24 runes"
2.0,Bought these after reading the PureWow article & checking reviews. I’m a short and curvy 5’2 and the M is tight on the stomach to the point it’s almost annoying. (I don’t have a large stomach and M is always my go to) ordered the capri length bc I’m short and they still bunch at the bottom. The pockets are the best feature. Not sure I would purchase again.
2.0,Broke within a few weeks. My guess is because of leaving the end of the band out it caught on something...
2.0,Runs extremely small. I normally where a large or extra large. I knew it said runs small so got a 3xl but if you are large chested it will be tight around the bust
2.0,See through with the fit of a paper bag and has no stretch or curve to it
2.0,Watch arrived with a dead battery .
2.0,Unlined so each seam is very itchy.
2.0,Picture is so much prettier. The bead is kind of flat and dull . Advertised as a 3D bead.... barely is at all. ☹️
2.0,"Nice looking, but really small for face. Sun light comes down from top off glasses."
2.0,"The suit top was fine, but my husband said I looked like an easter egg. lol I sent it back."
2.0,"Love the colors! But the cut of it makes it almost impossible to keep it on your shoulders. If you plan to be walking around, or if it’s a windy day, this is not the cardigan for you."
2.0,The product is very thin and seems cheaply made.
2.0,Looks long in the picture but fit much shorter than a regular tank.
2.0,"Very flimsy soles, they were bent/squished from the way this and other items were packaged together during shipping. They were also way too big. We returned right away. Disappointed in the poor quality of the thin, flimsy soles & they were not in a shoe box so got so easily squished..."
2.0,I was very excited to find these as I am a tall lady and finding pants is extremely hard. They came in and I loved them! Wore them to work and even got complements. They’re comfy too. Downsides: washed them once per the instructions and now they’re not long anymore they shrank… now I have fancy capris which will not work for my job. The material also picks up EVERYTHING. every spec of dust hair etc. very disappointed.
2.0,"This set shrinks, even with a cold wash and hanging… You can apply some steam and stretch it back out, but be aware…"
2.0,My son likes the design on the mask but the ear straps are too loose and the mask does not fit well on his face.
2.0,"Good quality, but not true to size. Runs very small."
2.0,Dos horas de uso y se cayó el broche del frente (así que se me cae)
2.0,To many wrinkles. I don't have time to iron it after washing it. I'm sorry I bought it. I am planning on donating it. Can't return even though I have not worn it yet. UGH waste of money and time.
2.0,These rings were very cute and my daughter loved them.  Sadly they started turning her fingers gray
2.0,Pretty but does not stay tight. Strings so long also and the stick out everywhere and constantly slip.
2.0,Seam in front is coming apart lasted one month and a half.
2.0,I have a lot of 5.11 products and normally like everything I have purchased but these gloves fell apart on me. I would keep looking if you need some dependable gloves.
2.0,"This isn’t a real wrap dress. I suppose it does say that in the description, but I didn’t realize it until it came. How disappointing. It has a seam up the center of the dress and it crisscrosses in the center of the breast, which is awkward and not flattering. The sender also sent it in the wrong color, but it didn’t matter because I returned immediately."
2.0,I bought this replacement band back in September 2017.  It lasted until January 2018.  Needless to say I am not satisfied with this product.
2.0,the cut at the back is well off. fits big too. 36 busts. hips 41. 140lbs.
2.0,I wear a size 9/10 and these did not fit me. Not stretchy at all. They are cute tho!
2.0,"I wear size 5 in pants, and the size s is very snug. Gives me a back fat roll when I pull this all the way up.. so i won't be wearing it. It kind of defeats the purpose of having everything look smooth. Definitely holds everything else in, but not comfortable to wear AT all."
2.0,"I realize that this is a very inexpensive sport watch, but that is what I was looking for.  I wear my watch to bed at night and like to check what time it is if and when I wake it.  Unfortunately the light in this watch is totally non-functional.  It doesn't light up anything so you can read it.  Also, between the dark dial and the dark LED numerals, I could not read the time during the day if I was in a dark area unless I had on reading glasses.  I believe the watch keeps good time, but I needed something else.  I gave it to my 10 year old grandson and he loves it!"
2.0,Chest area way too low. Cheap material
2.0,"I didn't expect much at the price, but I got even less. If you want a watch to wear for a day or two, then this might work out. If you want something to wear daily, save your time and money and go for another brand."
2.0,"I like the way this top looks and feels on, except the length is way too long! It reaches my thighs. But I will keep it and make it do what it do. Can possibly wear it with a belt or simply allow it to gather at the waist.<br /><br />*update* After 1 or 2 washes two of the metal eyelets that the string laces through have come off. Unfortunately it's pretty noticeable. So this top is now another &#34;lounge at home&#34; top which I didn't need more of. What a waste."
2.0,Two of the bands’ attaching pins were defected which made it impossible to attach them to the watch
2.0,Not great for a big bust gives you a uniboob
2.0,Cheapest feeling swiss watch I have ever touched. Spend more for a good swiss automatic
2.0,"Size is way off for a curvy female.  The description made it sound like they were shaped more for women than men, but when they arrived they were way to tight in the hips and rear.  My daughter, who usually wears an XL, had to reorder and get a 4X in order to get a pair that fit."
2.0,The mold is bad so the butterfly is missing part of it's wing.  Very disappointed.  Should have been obvious to the person shipping it.
2.0,Cheaply made. You can see seams from the neckline does not sit well and not a comfortable material.
2.0,Cute pattern but see through
2.0,"meh - kinda frumpy IMO. It's going back! Maybe it would be better in black. the fabric is thin, slinky and looks cheap, but then again... it is a cheap dress. Great design ideas - but it just didn't hit home. The skirt is short, the waist is high, it's baggy, The color is brighter than what I expected."
2.0,wow this is made for a big giant hand it would not fit me I have small fingers and the girls real small my husband they did not even fit on them this was a waste of money
2.0,had an allergic reaction even though it says hypoallergenic surgical steel..<br />(if you dont have any allergies to metal this is a very nice nose ring)
2.0,Cheaply made. Not as nice as pictures.
2.0,"Hat looked wonderful except for the I in America was not there looks like it was forgot about. So I use this hat as a work hat, which is sad because it has wonderful potential to be a top notch hat. But because of the simple overlooked mistake I would not recommend ordering from this company."
2.0,"They’re made weird. I own a pair from Nordstrom and love them. These would require me to pull them up below my breasts just to have a normal waist band. I’m small, but not that small... they’re poorly made - despite a cute design."
2.0,The sweater is so thin it shouldn't be called a sweater. More like a hoodie shirt. Description is deceiving.
2.0,The center of the circle is faded and is darker not crisp black and white
2.0,Siempre pido esa talla pero es demasiado pequeña
2.0,They're very pretty but 2 pairs were broken on arrival
2.0,Ok looks better on Internet
2.0,It looks great but way too small in the waist area. I got a 2x and feels like a M. It's sad that you pay so much for something and it not fit comfortably.
2.0,"Nice ring, and I've had a few people notice and comment positively.<br /><br />Update: January 2017, 9 months later. The ring is very out-of-round and the woven section is loose. It's a $15 ring, but still I was surprised that a 925 ring would get that distorted and the Celtic weave would partially detach.<br /><br />Update: July 2017 and at 16 months the inner weave is almost completely detached. The woven part also seems to have stretched or explanded and is now slightly larger than the main ring base meaning it gets caught on things and materials get under the weave and is hard to get out. The photos are from July 2017 and show how the ring is coming apart. Ring was bought March 2016.<br />Down from 3 to 2 stars."
2.0,These were very itchy feeling even after being washed. My son wouldn’t keep them on.
2.0,"Nice socks, except I have large holes in both socks after wearing them for half a day."
2.0,"i ordered a medium, the top fit perfect, but the bottom legs were too small, these are Asian sizes. If you have  some sort of a figure/shape this will not work for you."
2.0,The picture of the pendant was what I would call blurry.  Size of pendant was good. Chain was too short for my husband's neck but would be okay for a teenager.
2.0,Awful material. Fits decent.
2.0,You get what you pay for. The frames are pretty cheap.  The arms have already broken off of one pair.<br />Update:9/19/2018 - Three of the Five pairs that I have been using have broken now. I do not recommend.
2.0,The button was broken when I received it but I had to wear it with a safety pin because I didn't have enough time to send it back to be replaced.
2.0,Nothing more to add. Cheap and cute
2.0,This is a potato sack.
2.0,"They fit a little small. And show every line and imperfections in your body. Even wearing a thong, you can see underwear lines very well.."
2.0,"Poor quality, the threads are coming off from being used only a couple if times"
2.0,Don't stay attached to teeth
2.0,"Cute, but doubt it's a actual stone, seems more like colored plastic,  as I've worn it once, & color is already flaking."
2.0,Ripped after 3 months
2.0,"This is such an odd set. I got the latte and black colored pack. It comes in a plastic box and has such an odd smell. I let them air out for two days. The latte one fits good, but the black one runs small. These are a little thinner then basic T-shirt bras. So if its a little chilly expect something to show. I usually like this brand but $13 for 2 it’s not a bad deal."
2.0,"I’m 5’2”, wear a women’s small and can usually tailor long pants to fit me, but the entirety of this outfit was just way too big. Fit me like a large. Quality was good."
2.0,"I wasn't expecting great quality at this price but my expectations were even lowered when it arrived. The fabric was very heavy and the cleaning instructions were confusing as to whether to wash it in cool water or ? There was a suggestion of low temp pressing but I wouldn't be willing to try  it. The synthetic mixture listed Polyester and Spandex but the Army could use this stuff for heavy gear. The size chart didn't run true to measurement. From the reviews, it seems that some women like it but I'd save my money and get better fabric."
2.0,These fit super loose.
2.0,Customer service is great. The product looks good.. but in less than a month the black part peeled off. It still looks good all silver but its not what we wanted.
2.0,"Watch came in nicely packaged without damage.  Band is a little short, but for me it's a nice fit and looks like a professional leather watch. Feels comfortable on my arm, so yes I'm pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />Update: May 28, 2018.<br /><br />The band on the watch broke, and i didn't do anything to cause it to break. It just all the sudden fell off my arm onto the ground. Granted, it is a nice stylish watch, but the band is very cheaply made. I plan on buying a new band for it..."
2.0,It's huge and heavy but it looks cool
2.0,"I really liked this piece. However, within one week of use the earring fell out of my ear. I found the post separated from the earring and the piece is now unusable"
2.0,I do not like the quality it shows very cheap.  and don't stop like in the photo.
2.0,"Nice material, but you have to order at least 3 sizes up to fit perfect."
2.0,"Not sure why the product pictures market this top as something you would wear with jeans or even a top you could wear going out. This is a workout tank top made out of workout material with pads and a gray inside seam. Additionally, this took over a month to receive!! Lol had I been expecting a workout shirt I may have rated higher. I guess that’s what I get for buying a product with no ratings. If you are looking for a workout shirt, this fits well but the color is a little off. Personally, Would not buy again. Had I known, this was what I would receive after expecting something different for the entire months wait, my rating would be higher. Please be more clear about what you are selling and just how long it takes."
2.0,Love these shoes and had them in gray before. The maple color leaves a stain on my baby feet tho so won’t be ordering this color again. Amazing shoe tho just get a different color
2.0,Mine come dirty
2.0,I would love to get a bigger size because the one I received is too small
2.0,"Was larger than the instructions let me believe, thus I had to give them to someone else that could use them. Not bad, just make sure you measure more than twice..."
2.0,"I was not aware this bra was stiff material instead of silicone.  The reviews were great, though.  My first wear was uncomfortable and constantly felt like it was peeling off. I had no lotion or moisturizer on my body, nor was I sweating. It did its job for a few hours, but im not sure it will hold up next time. The silicone sticky bras make me forget im wearing anything.  This actually made me uncomfortable and self conscious."
2.0,Not a mirror pieces as advertised which is pretty disappointing. Quality is as expected for the price. Okay in a pinch if you wear your hair down...
2.0,Meh. Not impressed. Too expensive for quality and crappy blue shirt
2.0,It was very small and difficult to make out save your money !
2.0,"Fits, but disappointed does not look like picture."
2.0,Maybe all leggings will forever give some of us ladies a 🐫 toe but these ones are some of the worst... otherwise they are squat proof and cute. I just always wear a big shirt anyway so I live with it🫡
2.0,Cute shirt but much smaller than expected. More like a crop top. Cheap material and definitely not made for my curvier topped ladies. I immediately returned it
2.0,I didn't realize that this Nato strap was only the single strap type.  I should have paid closer attention to the pictures.  Early signs are that this strap wont hold up to the test of time.  After 1 day the hole being used looks like its about to tear.  Considering returning if gets worse
2.0,The stays do not stay together with any activity.
2.0,"I bought 3 bands, two bands came with the right size and a band 1 inch bigger, as my wrist is very thin it makes a big difference."
2.0,Attractive slippers that fit perfectly. They are not substantial enough. I don't feel the warmth and cushioning I do with the more expensive brands.
2.0,"Cute, but discolors too fast."
2.0,Very uncomfortable! Disappointed!
2.0,Didn't think quality was very good
2.0,"Good quality material, but a bad design, especially if you have bigger breasts. The shoulder straps won't stay up and it provides no support. I would return it, but I do like the bottom and plan to wear the bottom with a different top."
2.0,It was a pretty design but the overall fit was too large. I ordered a medium and it fit as a large. Also the torso isnt as long as it is in the picture.
2.0,Half these collar stays were way too long to fit ANY shirt I own.  Not sure what is the point of including these huge stays.  Maybe the vendor expects a sudden return to 1970's-style giant collars?<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the stays themselves... except that I had to throw away half of them since they were a useless size.
2.0,Beautiful watch bought it for my mom for Mothers Day and it worked GREAT! For about three weeks then it stopped ticking and stopped working. Not worth the $20 so I would not buy again. I returned the watch yesterday and have to wait 7 days for my refund.
2.0,"Esta linda , pero el fruncido de la espalda no se ve bien , hace que se suba y se vea mal..... creo que solo la usaré para hacer ejercicio en casa"
2.0,"This collar necklace was very flimsy and easily bent, which is exactly how it arrived at my home.  It was not packaged well enough to keep from getting bent and was very thin and pliable.  I tried to reshape it but it is still not right.  I was cheap in more was than one.  I will probably end up trying to find one locally.  I wish I had taken a photo before I unwrapped it and tried to reform it."
2.0,Cute hat..... but washed once and it’s already fuzzy.
2.0,Didn't fit very well and hard to use the captive balls
2.0,"When I first put it on, I thought I liked it and it was comfortable. I like the fit at first and it seems made well. I don’t like the way the bra shapes though. It’s definitely a push up and I love that it’s underwire free, but it gives a very weird shape. It pushes completely up and to the center, leaving no side profile. It felt weird and looked really awkward under clothes, kind of like a giant uniboob I guess would be the best description? Not returning this because I wore it, but I don’t recommend because of the shaping."
2.0,Just cheap quality and design.
2.0,I love the googles when they arrived! Was thrilled but after wearing them in the water I was very disappointed!  You can’t see clearly or focus! And they leak! Won’t recommend this product and won’t be buying again!
2.0,too small disappointed in the fit
2.0,This would be a stunning necklace if it wasn't painted... both the chain and the back of the pendent are painted and the dark color comes off rather easily. I returned the first one I bought and got a second. The first one hasn't even arrived at the warehouse and the second one has already started chipping.
2.0,The cotton material was much thinner than I had anticipated so I returned it.
2.0,"I liked the dress, but I have to get it  altered underneath the arm area. The gap there is so large I can't wear it."
2.0,Rings are very small
2.0,"I was very pleased to have thin wool socks for the cooler Florida days.  However, the first pair that I put on quickly developed a hole in the heel - on the first day worn - and had to be tossed out.  I hope the other pairs do better.  I would not re-order."
2.0,Not vrry durable -- fell apart - do not recommend daily use❗
2.0,The posts arrived bent and they are flimsy
2.0,"Fits odd, therefore despite several attempts to wear it, I have always opted that it is a weird fit.  I donated this last week.  :("
2.0,The slit is weird! Not sure if I will ever wear it.
2.0,"I'm really disappointed, it was shipped fast. However it doesn't look nothing like the picture. It looks very home made. Like a kid made it in school in fashion class. I will try an make it look good with some jeans or leggings."
2.0,I only gave this 2 stars because the images are so blurry. I should’ve returned it but it is cute and I do love the Wizard of Oz.
2.0,I am petite. I wear a size 4 in pants. I ordered the small and they are so tight I can’t even get them on.
2.0,"They supposed to be same size, they have the same tag size but they are completely different."
2.0,"It didn’t fit as well as expected , it’s a bit too baggy at the top and too fitted at the bottom so it gives a boxy shape"
2.0,I read the reviews but I gave it a trust vote and bought it. It's a nice style and fast shipping. Poor quality and I had to sew the beads one by one. And threads were showing up everywhere.
2.0,"This had a strange fit and did not look good on my ""mom body""."
2.0,had to return it cause the fit was super weird and the fabric was very thin. cheaply made. super bummed
2.0,Not to happy with this change colors
2.0,"The chain is cheap (not the same one as in the picture) and the ring has an inscription from a past tour date (that part wasn’t pictured, I wouldn’t have bought this if I saw the whole ring.)"
2.0,"Its so pretty and delicate, but it was nearly impossible to get the clasp open, I can't image how much it will hurt trying to get it open while in my ear. Its also super thick, and barely long enough to go through the daith. Maybe it would be good for a different type of piercing, but if you're looking for daith, maybe skip this one."
2.0,These wool socks are very scratchy. I felt guilty putting them on my son as I knew they would be sooo uncomfortable. They are from a Japanese manufacturer and they run quite large.
2.0,"I don't think anything about these &#34;look real.&#34; That said, they're cheap."
2.0,I usual wear a large in shirts but I read reviews for this that it runs small so I ordered the XXL.  I was able to get it on but it was super tight and could not button the buttons.  It is a shame because the top is super cute!
2.0,had a hole in the sock...  near the ankle.  bummer.  sock was cute!
2.0,"Really didn't care for it, was a returned item."
2.0,Cheap fabric and design. Immediate pilling between thighs. Shrinkage up the leg after a few washes and the hem lost shape/warped/sagged earlier on than expected. Also not though fabric allotted for the foldover.
2.0,fabric is very thin and bras are much smaller than other brands of the same size
2.0,"Vet small. Size chart is way off. I'm a US 12-14 30 in waist. Curvy built . ordered the 5X and the jacket was very very small, could not fit it. Returned the jacket. 2 Stars because the jacket is nicely made and looks like the picture."
2.0,The fabric was so thick and synthetic. And the hem was super tight. I normally wear a size 8 but it was too tight on my hips - no loose and flowing at all. Returned it
2.0,"Ordered XXL and got three different sizes, Only one out of the three fit !!"
2.0,Way too big!!  Gave it away.
2.0,"Cute dress, but I would need to size way up. I couldn’t get it on at all."
2.0,I have already reviewed this item. The color and texture were not as suggested in your photos and it contained a flaw.  I returned it.
2.0,I bought it and didn't read the review . I wish I had. Loved how it looked but I can't wear it. If you allergic to certain metal do not buy this product. If not then it is really pretty and it came in quick .
2.0,"Not what is pictured. The skull is much smaller, can't really tell it's a skull. Overall the ring is bigger and more gaudy. The stones are pink instead of black. Very sparkly if that's what you are looking for. The ring size seems to run bigger. The main reason I decided it's not what I'm looking for is that it was too big and gaudy, and because the skull didn't look like a skull."
2.0,"It's a nice idea , looks ok but is too much plastic , I fear that is going to break as soon as I put it on. I will return it."
2.0,good for a little while but stones fall out. Be very careful
2.0,"It's sold as one size fits all but it really on fits one, a very small person."
2.0,"The inside of the skirt reminds me of the inside of a sweatshirt. The material is soft and thin, but it also makes the skirt very relaxed and casual looking. Not versatile and not what I was looking for."
2.0,Would not buy this brand again.
2.0,Love the colors and loose style (returned for size L — my bust is 36).  Cheaply made.  To wear it I will have to add iron on interfacing to keep the stitching from showing in the front opening of the bodice.
2.0,"The fit and style are great, however, one of the cuff hems came out within a day."
2.0,Purse zipper not secure. A 10 cent coin fell to as soon as I had zipped up the purse.
2.0,"While they stated they were fully adjustable, I wasn't able to get them to fit my 5 year olds head (the bottom of his ears were below the cup. He's tall for a 5 year old, but figured I was safe seeing they were advertised up to small adult. I'm not sure these would fit an average sized kid over the age of 8."
2.0,"The dress is super cute but not true to size. I'm 5'7"" and 243lbs and ordered a 3x but, previously ordered a 2x. So disappointing."
2.0,"Weird fabric, fit and feel"
2.0,Not worth the amount of money charged. I was disappointed by the quality . Weight of bracelet is very light and the quality of stones are not believable.  Will return.
2.0,"This belt is very wide and hard to adjust, and it doesn't fit my pants. Not worth the hassle of returning it. But it is well-made and durable; hopefully"
2.0,I thought it would be more like a compression garment but it isn't. It does not have a firm hold on the shape.
2.0,Could only wear red and white pair and bigger gold pair because my ear is pierced too high up. My friend was ok wearing them.
2.0,I wanted to love these socks however after receiving them today I realized there is no way these are 70% merino wool.<br />1. They have not provided any warmth<br />2. They feel like a acrylic material w maybe 1% wool.<br />They are soft but that's about all they have going for them.<br />I did some additional research on Melino Wool only to find that a pack of 3 on other sites go for $70ish......soooo......that's another indicator that these are not real or 70% Wool.<br />Really upsetting!!!
2.0,Check the size before click
2.0,I bought these to replace some laces in a converse.They were shorter than I expected so could barely tie them. I also did not like the quality of the laces as they get fuzzy easily after being washed a few times. The color was always a brighter beige than I expected.
2.0,"At first I loved the waist trimmer and was very excited to use it after reading the reviews. After wearing it for about 8 times, the Velcro no longer sticks! At first I thought that maybe there was lint which caused it not to stick but after inspecting both sides, I saw that it just wont stick to the other side of the trainer. Was very disappointing since the trainer was very comfortable."
2.0,"Ordered according to size chart, bikini fit to big throughout and to small in the cup. 🥴 Color is at pictured."
2.0,The clasp was so tiny you need a magnifying glass to grip it. It is so lightweight. Not a good value at all.
2.0,"I bought these for my wife.  They are very small (too small).  The stones are beautiful and the silver very nice, but they're only suitable for a small child.  I returned them."
2.0,They advertise as a compression tank. It is most certainly not.
2.0,It’s soft and warm but too big for me
2.0,"I loved the feel of it but when washed, it has 'piles' all over it. The darker one shows up really bad. Not good quality fabric."
2.0,really cute but very small
2.0,"Good time, great fit, but I got it in a spandex material that was no where near the right color"
2.0,"Lengthwise, it was a bit short. The breast &#34;cups&#34; were too low for me, so i cut holes in it to remove them. It fit a little better after, but still a bit small."
2.0,Has very cheap foam inside and cuts into the bridge of the nose
2.0,"The bracelet was too small, did not fit comfortably, as well as the print is too small. returned to sender on December 7."
2.0,Super big!!!! This no where near a small! I haven’t tried to shrink it in the wash yet. Cute shirt but way too big! There wasn’t anything smaller then the small either.
2.0,I ordered a large before it was huge I have a 38 bust it should have been tight I ordered a medium now 36 it is still huge it does not give it tight feeling at all there's plenty of stretch but that's only when I pull on it I wouldn't recommend this their sizes just runway too large
2.0,The text is printed far too close to the edges. For this specific design it matters if you can’t read it.
2.0,Shirt is more for a 6-9 pants is more for a 1 year old.
2.0,It was enormous and I ordered a small!!
2.0,After 1 wash (I only wash in cold water) lost its color and now it’s gray.<br />And definitely not wrinkle-free.
2.0,not  for me
2.0,I would have liked the product if it would have been a little more thicker. Most of them tear while I’m putting them on. I have to wear two or three to be able to say they last. I use them when I’m cutting up spicy stuff and the pepper juice still manages to get through the material.
2.0,Only one is a good size
2.0,"Not as easy to use as previous Obtyx I've used before. They'll do in a pinch, but not for daily use."
2.0,The fabric was what you’d expect for the price. It is way too big and long. I’m 5’8” and it’s too long even with heels. I have to return it.
2.0,The print and quality is nice- the sleeves were massive (wide) even at the cuff/wrist
2.0,Just don't seem to fit like the ones I purchased at the department store.
2.0,A little short and made a little odd
2.0,Ordered a ponytail  hat and received a hat that wasn't a ponytail hat. Was alittle embarrassed when the person opened the gift and it wasn't what I hoped😣
2.0,The print on the shirt is perfect but runs way too small. Bought for pumpkin patch this weekend and now can’t wear it.
2.0,"Item arrived one day after I ordered but I noticed it was too small. I believe the size chart provided was not correct.<br />I ordered the shorts in a XXL. The Waist should be 38"" but is 21""  Low hip should be 49"" but is 20""  Thigh should be 30.25 but is 27"""
2.0,"These gloves definitely could keep my son's hands warm during the Sapporo Snow Festival, but it was so difficult to put on that he barely wore them."
2.0,"They feel amazing on but only after a few wears thru got these little balls all over them, which makes them unpleasant to wear now ☹️"
2.0,These were too big for my 6 year old. They also came open easily. Lost one the second day. :/
2.0,I don’t want to give a bad review. The band stated it had finished edges. The band keeps catching on things because there are edges that are sharp.
2.0,Material leaves you hot.
2.0,These are &#34;ok&#34;.  I don't wear it everyday - typically to work then I take it off when I get home.  I noticed yesterday that the coating or something is starting to peel.  I would not recommend these to anyone who wants to wear it everyday and never take it off.
2.0,Not as good as hoped! In fact they don't work well at all.
2.0,Thought I can make this work. Nice Flowy semi sexy shorter dress. Nope. There no shape and I got a medium. Just drapes over you like a tent. Even with high boots like the pic. Just looks bad
2.0,Stones are nice posts are weak backings don't fit
2.0,Zipper came unattached on one side. IT'S A GORGEOUS DRESS. But i have to take it to a seamstress
2.0,Nice dress.  Very itchy again shows knee length and it's not even close.
2.0,Will not tighten enough to lay flush on neck as a choker.
2.0,"Sooooo cheaply made, and no matter how I bend it, it won't stay in place. Uncomfortable hunk of junk. What a shame - the design was so cute!"
2.0,The stitching feel out of one corner on day one. If you step on the back more than twice they will break... not impressed.
2.0,These really did not help me organize the way I had hoped.
2.0,"cute shoes...but one shoe fit very sloppy. had the right size., could not walk in them. I returned the shoes."
2.0,"If you’re short, don’t bother. It’s a paper bag lol."
2.0,I only wore it one time..not put together well...it all broke
2.0,"“has the characteristics of super light, super toughness, and never fading.” Didn’t even wear them a dozen times and the arm broke."
2.0,"Even though this is a nice band and comfortable, the clasp, even when clicked shut, will not stay closed.  It fell off several times and it was only luck that the watch wasn't broken!  I'm returning it for this reason."
2.0,Looks fine and I'm sure it's perfectly durable. The problem is the fit. I ordered a size 10 which ordinarily is fine for my RH ring finger. Not only was it larger than expected but the width of the band makes it slightly uncomfortable to close your hand. I have normal dude hands so I can't imagine I'm alone in this opinion. I don't think half sizes are an option so don't be surprised if it doesn't fit like you're hoping. I can wear it and it stays on its just bigger than most size 10 rings and the band is unnecessarily wide. I doubt I'll ever wear it.
2.0,I don’t recommend this product for anyone bigger than a US size 10. I am a size 16 and it does button but is definitely not comfortable or flattering. Will be returning it 😞 sadly.
2.0,Nothing because it was to big for my beads
2.0,Was disappointed with these earrings because I though they would be a deep dark red and they look more pink. I got them for someone who was born in January since garnet is their birthstone. Pink was a very big disappointment.  If you want little pink stones then the see be would be great.
2.0,"Husband bought as a gift. Looks like it’s picture.<br />The set is thick like a blanket, really cute but a 2x pant didn’t go past my knees."
2.0,Only received 7
2.0,I didn’t ;like these at all.  They ride up into your eyes and cause our glasses to steam up.
2.0,Bought this hoodie for my grand daughter. The fit is fine but the material used for the sweatshirt is very cheap and pilled severely after the first wear.
2.0,Missing the ac adapter.  Not in the package.
2.0,"I realize the closure on this wrist wallet needs to be secure so your phone doesn't fall out, but the snaps on it are VERY difficult to open. I've sprayed them with WD40 in the hope of making them open easier, but no. Almost to the point that I'm not sure I can use it. I wish it had velcro closures instead, they'd be much easier to work with."
2.0,Watch out for the size not as market XXL is line medium
2.0,Runs very small. Good color and design but too small.
2.0,"They aren't sized correctly. The pockets are too high and they don't cover the rear as advertised. I would return, but I washed and hung to dry them per the instructions. Disappointed."
2.0,"This dress is super cute and comfortable, I loved the way it fit. The deal breaker for me though, it has really thin material that is see through. I was wearing a nude bra and underwear and you could see them perfectly beneath. If you want to wear this dress you would have to buy a slip or something to go beneath."
2.0,Gloves do not fit perfectly. Also over time gloves continue to stretch.
2.0,"When I received this 2 piece sweatsuit it was only 1 piece the top.<br />I did get a full refund, so I'm ok with it.  Just hesitant to try again."
2.0,Runs on size to small.
2.0,"I believe that the fit was as expected, but maybe a tad bit small. I wanted to write a review because I am now only able to wear the dress once. The dress actually started to fall apart before I left for the botanical outdoor wedding I attended this past weekend. The chiffon is very thin. I had to keep my dress together at the sleeves with staples. Lol! I do not believe that people noticed, but I wasn't happy. I should have chosen something else to wear but I only packed this dress and was short on time to make other arrangements. I pulled it off, but it wasn't worth the efforts. Almost $20 wasted. I mean, I know it's a cheap dress, but geez, I thought it would hold up better.<br /><br />I love florals and I figured this would be a great lightweight option for the outdoor wedding, oh well.... I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,It suck when it gets tangle I broke it
2.0,"They work for the holiday ""switch it up"" game but I wouldn't keep these in my toddlers ears long. 2 pair looked good, the others were cheap looking."
2.0,Smells disgusting and very strongly. Color did not match the image.
2.0,Thin. No thread seam on top or bottom of mask bandana.
2.0,The shirt is soft and comfy but I’m 5’10 and I bought a large and it was still too tight in the shoulder and chest. It was long enough but shrunk in the wash. I’m very slender so it definitely runs small.
2.0,The area around the arm pit is too tight and not enough gather at the back.
2.0,"Cute shirt, cheaply made (as expected). Didn't like it when I got it, so I donated it."
2.0,We were disappointed that it did not come with the sports strap that is in the product image.
2.0,"Need a good travel dress and read many reviews.  Sizing for this item appears to be all over the place, but based on reviews, I ordered my normal size medium.  Even though I wear medium from US manufacturers, this Laksmi dress is way to tight, too short-waisted, and hemline is too short.  It also has a very strong dye smell.  If I were keeping it I would definitely wash it before wearing, but this tiny smelly dress is going back.  Style is cute, color is lovely, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1 star."
2.0,My daughter who is 10 only wore these once. They were really small. Check the size before ordering. The quality was good though.
2.0,I love the way it looks and wear it when I dress up but it slides around a lot is rather loose.  The fitbit face is bit to heavy for the band. I was hoping to wear it more but its just not functional for everyday use for me. Still looks really nice though!
2.0,was a lots of ones that didn't worked.
2.0,"The sunglasses seem to be nice, but! I haven’t been able to use them, because the do not fit over my glasses."
2.0,"They're too wide across and up and down that my foot slides around in them, very odd fit. Going to look for something different."
2.0,"Dress has a sheen to the material and it is very lightweight and see through, very inexpensive material. Not a fan unfortunately"
2.0,Not good at all. They was already broke. A waist of money.
2.0,The pattern in the chest area was AWFUL
2.0,I LOVE the style and the idea of this product but the waist band limits the versatility for short people. I am 5’2” and it just was way too long on me with no options but the tie at the waist.
2.0,"I ordered to wear to work. I work in the ED and have to wear a mask for 12+ hrs a day.  I wanted a cap with buttons on it for my mask hoops.  The description on here says ""buttons"", but all 4 of these caps came without buttons.  Very disappointing and makes wearing a mask more uncomfortable"
2.0,"The color looks nice and material feels and looks nice.  I don't like the gap in the back.  Looks like they ran out of material on the back so the flares just end abruptly, has a wide gap where it ends. Just did not like it."
2.0,"I'm returning it. I really wanted to like it but I was disappointed. The color of the blue one is more green than blue. The dimensions are a bit off, not by much but enough that it didn't fit insert I use. The  zipper doesn't go full length which makes it difficult to keep items secure and difficult to get some items in and out. Its heavy. Does fit on shoulder but only because of the dip, which I didn't like. The bag itself is good quality and looks like it would hold up to everyday wear and tear."
2.0,No es muy bueno
2.0,"This swimsuit is so cute but is made for someone tall with a small bust. I wish it fit me but with a larger bust, it was too tall as a fit for my frame. So cute though!"
2.0,"I love the look of the Waldo Reading Glasses but they were much larger than expected... they would probably fit a man's face not a female's face in width. It. Would be helpful is this company had a chart to refer to regarding sizing. I give it five stars in style, 3 stars in construction and no stars in sizing."
2.0,"This was a disappointing purchase.  The package states this is a ""Speidel Express"" band and has the retail price of $5.89 on it NOT $24.99 as stated on amazon page.  The band is very thin and cheaply made.  I am not familiar with the Speidel Express line but obviously it is their low quality end.  The band does not even say ""Speidel"" on it like all other Speidel bands I have ever owned.  I cannot imagine this band lasting very long.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,Not even the same as the picture !  Poor quality face !
2.0,"The fabric is nice but the size is not right. I order a bigger size than what I wear, and it didn't fit"
2.0,Too small for the average size hand but still beautiful.
2.0,I chose the folding panel as it was advertised to be a faster charger but after a day and a half in the sun here in Hawaii I got maybe a 50% charge.  I expected more like 75% after a full day with the two panels.
2.0,The ring is beautiful however it is very flimsy and bends very easy. I would not buy this again.
2.0,One of the stoppers has broken off already
2.0,All of the shells broke off with in an hour
2.0,The idea is cute but it does not say which side is front and which is back and fits a little weird.
2.0,"The blouse received is cheap looking. Material is not the same as pictured, color and fabric not good quality. Very disappointed, runs small"
2.0,The fit was not suitable
2.0,"I thought that these glasses would be your regular round glasses with yellow lenses, but when it arrived I was surprised at how large they were. They are just way too large and look silly whenever you wear them, I wanted them as a statement piece but was disappointed."
2.0,Cheap made very thin
2.0,"They fit fine when I received them, they have great grip. After the first wash they shrunk so much, and I air dried them!"
2.0,"I bought this for myself. It’s very lightweight and dainty. It is as described, and I love it!<br />UPDATE: I SPOKE TOO SOON. I HAD THIS BRACELET 3 DAYS, AND IT BROKE THIS MORNING WHILE I WAS GETTING DRESSED. I was moving it on my wrist. so it wouldn't be under my sleeve, and it broke and fell on the floor. Not as good of a quality as I thought. I will be contacting the seller."
2.0,While they’re nicely put together face masks and fit my face nicely these are NOT kids masks. They’re definitely made for adults.
2.0,I don’t like how big the slider is
2.0,Top is very large for a 5 year old...nothing up top of course. Be prepared to be vacuuming up little silver stars every time your little ballerina dresses up.
2.0,loock soooooo cheap
2.0,"Bought a size small for my 14 year old daughter and it fit her, as she’s thin but idk if that would work for a grown adult. Smalls pretty small. It’s made well? But it just feels cheap."
2.0,"Did not have backings, does not lay flat."
2.0,This dresss fits snuggly (runs on the smaller side) and the material isn't the best.  It's easy to see right through when in any light.  Plus the material feels cheap.  The style is nice & the slit is at the perfect spot.  It's an ok dress.
2.0,My daughter wore these 1 time for about a 4 hr ballroom event. Then the very next time she put them on for less than an hour a week later the sole at the bottom  was hanging off and she didnt wear them any time in between. I was very disappointed. She wasn't being rough either.
2.0,Fits okay.  I wear 10 1/2 and heel of sock comes up to my Achilles.  I own 3 other brands of compression socks and this is my least favorite pair.
2.0,"The quality was ok, except that after wearing once, there was a huge hole in the lace. Also, they didn't all fit the same. The grey one was shorter than the others and kept bunching up and had to be pulled down. They are long, which is what I wanted in an undershirt, and there is a little stretch. I would have kept them except for the tear."
2.0,This dress was too small and didn't look right on me. The sleeves were very boxie. It just had a weird cut to the whole dress. Wouldn't order again.
2.0,It was too tight on me so I would've needed to buy a bigger size.
2.0,Orders 2 sizes up .. still to small
2.0,"I wish I could’ve kept it but it’s going back. The cut on the dress is a bit narrow so if you have bigger hips, thighs or booty it won’t look flattering. Maybe order up if that’s your case but then the top may fit too big. The material is thin and the dress isn’t lined but the print is very pretty. Also the dress is long (as expected like the photo), I’m 5’7 and the large fit me about 4 inches past my knee in length. I did like it overall just not the fit for me."
2.0,Did not like the thickness quality
2.0,"Too much gold looks cheap like a girl's toy, unfortunately it's not my taste in price, maybe it's not worth it.<br />Demasiado dorado luce barato como un juguete de niña desaforadamente no es mi gusto en precio igual no vale."
2.0,"Love the look, so fun. But broke within the first five wears :( Disappointing."
2.0,THE TOP FIT FINE.  THE B0TTOMS WERE HUGE.
2.0,I'm not sure how I feel about these. I'm a little bigger now after having my last baby but even a large is tight. It feels like theres not much stretch to them.
2.0,They arrived quickly.  Just as described and untwist on both ends. I put it in the first day. So happy! Update- the gold fades off. Not happy.
2.0,Buy a size or two up! Trying to get my daughter's Head in the shirt is a no go! Cute pj's but definitely not worth the price
2.0,Lasted one day on my 12 sons neck before breaking.
2.0,"Very cute. I ordered 0-3 months, for a newborn baby. The investor is so small that I don't think even a preemie could fit into it. Now I must pay for postage once again."
2.0,Very cheap. Definitely made in china. Really badly sewn and choppy but overall its wearable.
2.0,The material great but isn't relax/loose fit as described. Length is much shorter than expected too. I even got a size up
2.0,"I wear & ordered XL based on reviews & size chart. These pants are built a little strange. They are very tight in the calves but get looser & bigger up to the waist that refuses to stay up. I didn't know this would be a problem when I tired them on so I wore 1 pr to work out in. I was constantly pulling them up. As we all know, you must return everything in it's original condition so I'm stuck. Buyer be ware."
2.0,Too small!  Probably should order 2 sizes up
2.0,I bought two and the lights broke within 2 weeks of having them. Disappointed. They were cool when they worked but they stopped working. Ugh.
2.0,very tight thought it was going to be a little stretchy but not at all
2.0,It was unable to fit my daughters iPhone 6S Plus
2.0,The fabric is very thin so you have to wear a tank top or undershirt.
2.0,picture on Amazon makes it look nice but to me it is cheap looking
2.0,These are cheap shoes that look worse in person and fit a little small or maybe they are just made awkward.
2.0,Not as cool as they look in the picture .... was not even bummed when I lost one of them the next day
2.0,Did not fit to my normal size
2.0,"Too big, too much ruching, too long, too much material. Also the material is shiny and looks and feels cheap.  Saving it for Halloween to make a big cucumber costume out of it."
2.0,"Bizarrely small arms, nasty feeling fabric."
2.0,"It came folded and material is so weak, looks like paper.V"
2.0,Great length and sheer. Except the crochet on the chest (muted earth tone pastel) and the trim on the sleeves (florescent) were totally different! Just looks like a mess. :( bummed bc it was the right length.
2.0,"Cheap material.  They tore after the first wash,"
2.0,Clasp is much too hard to open...I may have to return it.
2.0,"I wanted to like it, but it just feels/looks cheap. The plastic card-holders inside seem flimsy and the money band is not expensive-looking. I got this to use as a gift but don't care for the look and feel.<br /><br />The size is fine, pretty low-profile. Good price, too. But it's just not for me."
2.0,"WAY TO TIGHT, MATERIAL OF VERY LOW QUALITY.  I DONATED IT."
2.0,"Smaller than expected, also I know it's a tee shirt, but seems VERY cheaply made. Also, the cut of it is strange?"
2.0,"This only gets 2 stars because the bottom fit but the top was way too loose! I'm 5'9&#34; 155 pounds 36DDD so I ordered the XL based on reviews. I think if i sized down there wouldnt be enough material on the top to cover my triple d's and the bottoms qould be tight. The cups are placed weird but without them it still was too loose. I could tie the strings behind my back and bring them back around to the front, knot it and have some string still hanging. It is cute until it's on so I have to return it."
2.0,"Very cute but the arms are incredibly too small. I'm a dress size 16 and the XL was too small in the arms. I couldn't even get it over my forearms. It's too bad, because it's very cute."
2.0,"Wore these ""wool"" socks for one day of non strenuous work wear and the material at the heals of both socks is unraveling.  Definitely not happy about that.  The socks are a weird size.  They're not ankle socks and they're not crew socks, they're somewhere in between.  Not fond of that.  The socks are advertised as being warm.  Mine weren't. Not happy there either.  That's three strikes, they're out.  Not recommended."
2.0,The top fit well but the pants were very small for the size ordered
2.0,"They do NOT do what they claim. I give them two stars because they fit well and are nice looking. As far as night vision goes, they add nothing to your being able to see at night. In fact, they actually darken your vision at night, kinda of like driving with your lights off. They don't block glare in wet conditions at night in any way whatsoever. They are not polarized in the slightest. They do not cut glare in daytime or at night and the term polarized just seems to have been randomly added to the description of these glasses. They may as well say these glasses are nuclear powered, because it's just as random as saying they are polarized or are night vision glasses. They will look nice on you, so if you already bought them, put them on after you get out of the car. If you haven't ordered them, don't."
2.0,Made in China for someone that is 5'2&#34;
2.0,was not to satisfied but it did the job...
2.0,"Very disappointed that the bag which looked like a soft GREEN in the picture, was actually just GRAY.  Also, the strap is rather difficult to adjust, if you want to go back and forth between crossbody length and a regular shoulder strap length.  The &#34;pebbled&#34; surface which almost looks like leather in the photos, looks more synthetic when you actually see it."
2.0,"The glue on the arm fell apart with in one week,but these glasses look great."
2.0,Yeah as someone else said these are a LOT thinner than the original lenses. So thin you can bend them easily. So thin they wiggle inside the frames. That's disappointing. I'm worried  one or both will fall out sooner or later.
2.0,"the word ""Women"" is false advertising in the description. lol Its 3 sizes smaller than what is stated."
2.0,They said cotton. Not with hot material. I live in Florida they are not what I wanted.
2.0,"I ordered the red in size large (Typically I'm a US size 4).  The material reminds me of a nightgown.  It's thin, cheap looking, and unlined.  The ruffles on the front are also off centered.  I will definitely be returning this."
2.0,"I dont work, it will not keep the time. I dont even wear it."
2.0,Ripped after second wear.
2.0,Nice but started to turn earring green and irritate my skin.but looks nice
2.0,"Very cheap looking, like something you find in a dollar store. Also very small. I'm a size 12 and it was so tight on me I couldn't wear it. It's supposed to be a one size fits all, but only if your a size 2."
2.0,"Top runs a little smaller. Arm/armpit area is a little more snug then everything else. The built in bra was not tight enough, had to sew elastic to reenforce it."
2.0,"Tools too small for Amazfit t-rex pro, can't replace band with tools provided."
2.0,"First, the good. The quality of these sunglasses was shocking. I was blown away at how well made they were, how great they looked, and how sturdy they were. For the price, I was expecting some flimsy glasses that would get me through a couple wears at the beach. They challenge some of my designer glasses both quality and aesthetics. But, they are awkwardly large. Maybe it’s just me, but they are just a hint too big. I love them, but I wish they were a hair smaller."
2.0,"This spider was bought as a 50"" Giant Spider and turned out to be a skinny 33"" when stretched to the max."
2.0,"The material is flimsy. There is no magnetic hold for the front to securely close so it flaps. The feture to stand the phone up to watch videos or read hands free is nice. I dropped my phone one on concrete and the case took all the damage so it was protective, but it was pretty banged up. This to me means it wouldn't take more impacts like that."
2.0,In the southern US. We’ve had a mild winter but still some cold days. I wouldn’t want these in snow. In 30 degrees with a slight wind chill they keep your hands warm for a few minutes then fail.
2.0,We are disappointed because we thought it would be the size of a normal messenger / school bag but it's about half the size.  The design is really cute but wish the size would fit books and binders.
2.0,"Really liked shirt so I ordered one. They didn't have a Large so I got an X-Large. Turned to be way too big except for bust.<br />I ordered a Medium next, thinking (hoping) it would work but nope-was worse than XL. I should have returned them. I missed the deadline in both cases. I don't understand why they do not carry size Large...????"
2.0,Es muy costoso para el material y lo que llega!! No le queda a un adulto es solo para niños. No me gusto.
2.0,"This has a cute shape overall, but the fabric is a little weird.... thick and really tight in the arms.  Not my favorite!"
2.0,"The picture is misleading, the &#34;glitter&#34; is not glitter. It looks more like fake fish scales. The material is cheap and uncomfortable."
2.0,"The bag really isn't waterproof, it's not the beach/pool bag I was looking for.  I will use it for a tote bag instead."
2.0,"The flare is small and starts maaaaybe mid calf at the highest, not at the glorious flare shown in the picture. Very disappointing."
2.0,some of the gems fell off and i always have to ask my husband to put it on me.
2.0,"Pattern/material, I felt was for a much older woman that what the advertisement photo represented. I returned mine"
2.0,So cute!!! But it runs way small! I order a large and fits tight. But it's cute
2.0,Liked how it look when ordering  but it comes small and it's to  see-through from private areas so not much coverage on your butt area nor the front ... Didn't like it .
2.0,"It does not stay in place. It creases when wore under a tshirt. And, the side holders are very uncomfortable."
2.0,"These are a waste. Have had them 5 months and they fell apart. We finally threw em in the trash the other day. Shame, they were comfy"
2.0,Black is see through. I bought the olive pair prior to these and love them so I got these and was not happy. Feels like a different material and was not as comfortable and I will not wear unless something is tied around my waist or I have a longer cardigan on because they are see thru. I do love the pocket though.
2.0,Too big and smells like fish
2.0,The face painted on the mask is huge so it looks really weird.
2.0,Runs about a size small. Not particularly comfortable.
2.0,"The shorts are like leggings, as well as the jacket. Not suit material at all but more of a body con stretchy feel. The collar was the worst...no structure because the material is too soft. It just doesn't look good to me."
2.0,"Straps are very uncomfortable, it's too small for an average face, broke very easily, you can tell not a lot of effort went into it with holes and pieces missing upon arrival. Not to pleased but after some glue and some paint and effort it makes a nice piece. But that won't get you more stars"
2.0,"These glasses have a very nice design. Best aviator design you can find for the price.<br />However, the lenses pop off so easily when you wipe them clean. That shouldn't happen. Also, one of the hinges is so flimsy that it feels like it will break. The other hinge is solid af.<br />I'm wondering if the seller sent me as used or refurbished one."
2.0,"The material was cheaper than they made it look in the picture, there has to be differing qualities of chiffon bc the one i recieved was of a cheaper quality. Not happy"
2.0,Cheaply made and broke the first day
2.0,My wife had to alter the dress for it to fit.
2.0,"The hat itself is quite nice. It has a good, crisp appearance and fits well. But the image printed onto the front was done cheaply with very little attention to detail or care in quality of work. It's not even on straight, which is something you really want to make sure of when you are trying to sell specifically to military customers! I have had this hat for about a month now, but it has not been an every day wear. I think I have actually worn it for about 10-12 days. The image already looks as if it has faded some, and the borders around the letters and image lines are already looking a bit blurry. It definitely does not give off that crisp appearance that the photoshopped image in the product description makes you believe.<br />I can get a blue hat like this anywhere. I bought this for the image, and the image has very poor quality to me. That is why I am rating this as 2 stars."
2.0,Very thin and poor quality...but you get what you pay for!
2.0,I don't like these slippers.  They make my feet sweat.
2.0,Size not correct.
2.0,"It is a silky shirt, not what I expected. Seems more like a Chinese fashion shirt versus the Christmas shirt I was looking for."
2.0,"I ordered this exact product several months ago and loved it. In fact, I went to re-order more right away, but the size seemed never to be in stock.  I was very excited when it finally was stocked and ordered the same compression and size as I had before.  This new order is nothing like the last one and is much larger and extremely more tight than previously.  So disappointed in this newest order versus what I’ve got from them in the past."
2.0,Like fit and color. Comfortable
2.0,"Not to happy with the shape, it was all out awkward! Very discouraging."
2.0,"The graphic in the shirt is the only good thing! The Mama Bear shirt is too short. Plus, I paid for 3 day shipping and it took over two weeks to get to me..."
2.0,Material is cheap quality.
2.0,"Item pictured showed the back panel , Summer Party and flower detail in deep red/ orange.  The product received had either a pale washed out orange or mustard yellow where this color should have been.  This caused the shirt to look drab and washed out and the Summer Party writing was almost impossible to read.  Returned item."
2.0,"As much as I like this cute flowy doll baby shirt, the sleeves were different. One was sewn well but the other one is practically coming off. With a couple wears, it’s definitely break off soon. I might return."
2.0,"The top fit fine, obviously since it's over sized, however the shirt I received was no way close to being off the shoulder.  If I tried to pull one side against my neck the edge of the collar didn't even make it halfway to my shoulder.  I may have a lot of larger bits on my body, but my neck is not one of them.  At least it's pretty?!  I was just mildly disappointed since that was the primary selling point for me.  Oh well!  Maybe if you're tinier this will work for you :)"
2.0,"Loved it at first. However, after not even 2 months the snap has caused the material to rip completely so now i have to buy a new one"
2.0,I wore one time and gave them to a friend. The sunglasses are okay just the lens tint was not of my liking. The lens are of a blue tint. The did fit well so the product was good.
2.0,One of the gems was loose in the bag so I had to glue it on. The metal part that holds the crystal is thin and poor quality.
2.0,The color and detail is beautiful. The size is way off. The sleeves are not as the photo shows. Very disappointed for the first time.
2.0,This training belt is pretty thick and has a very sturdy hold. I’m 5’4 weigh about 210-230 and I went with a medium not a good choice because when I wear it is very tight but I will keep as my motivation to lose the weight hence why I bought the product ! If I were purchasing for pain relief then I would’ve went with a L/XL for perfect comfort!
2.0,"I understand it’s not a slim fit,but this is way too big. I ordered the smallest size available and I’m 5’6, 125 lbs fit woman and this looks like a bag on me. It’s so unflattering that makes me look like I have huge stomach or waist while my real waist is actually very small. It doesn’t have a curve,it goes straight from shoulders so that’s what makes it so unflattering. I figured I could tie it to make it look better, but then I think I’ll just get another top.<br />Also,I don’t like when you can see stitches on it and material is polyester, so it’s not like sweater more like blouse."
2.0,did not stop snoring
2.0,came in a plastic wrap. Nothing great about this at all. Costume jewelry.
2.0,"Supposed to be leather & pearls--more like suede strips & plastic beads.  Granted, suede is leather but lower grade.  The &#34;pearls&#34; don't look realistic.  They appear plastic that have been dipped in colorant.  Not impressed."
2.0,When i ordered the necklace for my daughter i was expecting a pretty necklace with a horseshoe charm but when we got the necklace it was smaller than my daughters pinky nail
2.0,This shirt fits really weird. It’s tight around my shoulders so if you lift your arms up it looks really strange. Material is super thin.
2.0,This arrived repackaged and inside out. I order 100's of items from Amazon yearly. I rarely have trouble. This sweater was made too short and wide. Returned it. The color of red was very pretty.
2.0,If you have a 15in screen laptop don't get this. It barely fits and has to be forced in the case cause it's too small. Get a bigger one
2.0,"You'd think if you pay $16 for whats essentially a dollar store toy, it would at least come with more than 3 light modes and an option to have a solid non-changing color mode. Even the gradient mode just swaps back to flashing after a couple of seconds. There are better options for very similar products."
2.0,The don’t stay up. They are the right size but the slide down gradually durring the day and don’t fit tightly at the top
2.0,It’s a great concept and wished it would have worked. It deflated within the first 30 minutes. Never got to use it.
2.0,donated. did not  like the bag
2.0,Runs very small. Not boxy or flowy as shown. Very DISAPPOINTED! NOT oversized at all. Would fit a 10-12.
2.0,Either Thanksgiving really did a number on me or these run super small. “Fat man in a little coat” remake.
2.0,I got the light color and it fits true to size at first. It does stretch out later throughout the day. So I guess it depends how you like them to fit. Mom fit jeans.  I am short waisted and a lot of high waist jeans are not flattering but these look good at first. I have to wear a belt or they fall off as the day goes on. 2.5 stars.
2.0,The main reason I bought this shirt is the fact that it SAID it was cotton. I gave the shirt stars because it looks similar to the picture but there is NO way this shirt has any cotton in it. Feels like a polyester blend which is not comfortable on Florida. I  threw it away.
2.0,Not at all how it looks in the description but still useful and I like them anyways.
2.0,It was as though it was listed as a children’s skirt
2.0,The size was a little off... and thin
2.0,Super cute. But the material and super thin and cheap.
2.0,DID NOT LIKE. I SLEEP IN IT
2.0,"I'm not really a plus-size gal (12/14), but I have chunky thighs and I hate the thigh-high mushroom effect, so I went with plus size just to be safe. No luck - these were incredibly tight and very unflattering. There was also an odd greasy residue on the cardboard insert in the package. Of course you can't return stockings once opened, so now I'm stuck with these useless stockings. They really are pretty to look at draped over a hanger, but if you have large thighs, that's about all they're good for.<br />Fortunately, the capable folks at Sock Avenue were able to help - they recommended Leg Avenue's Plus Size Sheer &#34;Lace Top Stockings with Backseam,&#34; which were, oddly, so much stretchier they were almost too big, which was actually perfect. Now I just wish I knew what to do with these!"
2.0,Lindos pero me llego un arete el broche en mal estado no cierra
2.0,"Took forever to receive order. Glasses are way too heavy, won't stay in place."
2.0,The colors are not that vivid
2.0,I love the design but the sleeves are very short. I am tall(5’9”) and 155lb. I bought a large so that it is oversized and the chest/abdomen area is perfect but the sleeves are at that weird length that is not short enough to be 3/4 sleeve but not long enough for normal sleeves. I have tried to stretch but this material has no give. I’m disappointed because the colors are awesome. The material is not very soft either.
2.0,Doesn't make a secure hairstyle. Your bun will fall out roughly 10 times per day.
2.0,No way this sock fits a 6 year old.  Better for toddlers
2.0,"Wide band bras and I don't get along. They all tend to bunch up under my boobs.  Something stiff was used in the side where the band attaches. As you can see by picture, it folds and sticks out. It isn't very comfortable.  If you are shaped so the bra stays down, it will probably work fine.<br />The bra is pretty. The lace and padding are attached on the lower half and are separate on the top half of cup.  I have not washed them yet to give a review on that aspect"
2.0,"The sweater's color is not the same, it fits kind of weird, not at all like the picture and the material is cheap."
2.0,The logo was cheap iron-on. I was expecting an embroidery patch.
2.0,"Super comfortable stretchy material. But it runs too large.  And this picture does not depict how it actually looks.<br />If you're looking for a work dress/business casual, you nailed it.  Not something to wear out."
2.0,Watch band locking mechanism is fragile and opens with minimal movement
2.0,Lasted me two months and then it started falling apart do not recommend
2.0,They are definitely pretty but quality sucks. When I received them they weren’t glued the fringe was falling off I wouldn’t purchase again
2.0,"The ones I received are very small and does not even come close to covering the entire face. Because of the small size, it keeps moving around and you have to keep touching it to adjust, which defeats one of the purposes of putting the face mask in the first place.<br /><br />Its late for me to return, but would recommend other folks to check the fit as soon as you get them."
2.0,"This was not what I was expecting. The colors are not woven through and it is not a winter jacket.  I am disappointed in how thin it is and the texture is just awful. Also, it cannot be put in the dryer. The inside feels like a felt backed vinyl table cloth. Yuck."
2.0,Should have cup size for top
2.0,I thought this would be nice to wear once in a while but it never even covers my ear. I gave it to friend for her daughter and she loves it. She only 9 years old!
2.0,Very cheap material and too short
2.0,"The little gems in the circle necklace are so small that it kind of looks like you are wearing a small round necklace with little dents/chips in it. Yes, it does glimmer under the light, but personally I just found it really ugly. luckily, the two necklaces can be worn separately, so I never have to wear the circle one! It is a bit longer than a choker necklace, and the bar necklace is long and adjustable. Good deal for the price, I just ended up hating the look of the circle one.<br />Before you order, definitely zoom into the pictures to get a more accurate idea of what the necklaces will look like in person."
2.0,"I ordered what I thought was a boy’s medium, and I got a 3t. It’s cute but it’s too small."
2.0,Maybe a child's large NOT women's As another female do not wear clothes that are too small nobody wants to see muffin top YUCK this is NOT fluffy friendly
2.0,Ended up returning this; wanted to love it but the pant legs were shaped very odd.  The crotch was almost to my knees and the elastic around waist was too big.
2.0,Listen I got this cardigan to wear with this cute dress i have right but 1 its way too big and i got a small and two its so itchy. Please don't but this I should have listened to the reviews.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this hair braid extension to use with my Punjabi paranda. I loved the thickness although it was much too long for my liking, and it tangled like crazy. It felt like getting yourself trapped in those fake Halloween spider webs! It literally took me 45 mins to untangle it! Unfortunately I will be sending this back. Just cannot manage the type of synthetic material. You will need someone else to braid your hair using this extension, you will tangle yourself in a mess if you try braiding your own hair with it. I wish the material was more manageable. *sigh*"
2.0,"The first time I wore the shoes, the crease started to unravel on the left side.  The shoes were very comfortable... but they won’t last since the crease looks as though they won’t hold up.  They don’t seem as though they Were made with quality materials or properly made."
2.0,"Ok dress, fit was ok, weird looking colors-navy with red.  Material of dress sort of cheap.  I will be returning."
2.0,Didn't fit securely.  Keep falling out.  Finally lost it the first day.
2.0,I WISH I knew which makers actually make America sizes or Asia sizes.
2.0,Fits well but fell out of time in 2 weeks
2.0,Not 100% happy. The product was recommended from a friend. The first pair I had to return because they have dark streaks in the thigh area and this pair has some streaks but they are not as noticeable and honestly I don’t feel<br />Like returning at the ups store. I still<br />Have to pull them up during yoga and don’t feel they really help with my post pregnancy pouch :(
2.0,Looks nice but sized for  petite people with no bust.
2.0,I was excited for this and it failed me. I wear a 40C and the buttons would not close.
2.0,The earmuffs  looked and felt lovely but the little girl I gave them to could not put them on. She is eight with a normal size head.<br />I wish they were expandable
2.0,"I ordered a small and though being able to tighten the straps up to to fit, works well...the bottom half off the dress is totally built for someone with a huge ass.<br />You'd think with the material having stretch in it, they would make the small, AS A SMALL, but it was not.<br />Also, if you are ordering this for something quick, might want to think again. It's coming from China.<br />Can't expect excellence, as it was $11."
2.0,going back.  bought and XXL I am a size 14W and couldn't get it over my chest! I am a 42C.  I mean really?  Im not that big and this was way too tight.  Gorgeous color though the red was.  Shame.
2.0,I was so excited. I'm so disappointed I purchased this bag in hopes that it would work for my travel needs. unfortunately I am going to have to return the bag because the front pocket metal fastener will not unlock the pocket
2.0,"lover the shirt but after a few washing the thread down the seams start coming loose - I have 3-4 inches of thread I have to cut after each washing, even if I dry clean it."
2.0,"I really really like the look, but I'm sporting a little belly at the moment, and this just looks a little frumpy, and doesn't fit my shape. I mention this only because most clothes do fit me well. You're millage may vary, if course!"
2.0,didn't fit right Proportions are off
2.0,Very thin materials that the cup rim imprint can be seen from the outside.
2.0,Very cute but if you have a big behind rather than large hips then it will tend to get lost in your a$$. The top was flimsy and not enough support. But still cute nonetheless.
2.0,CUTE BUT THEY REALLY STINK. I CAN'T GET THE BAD ODOR OUT OF THE BOOTS. BUT PROBABLY WON'T SHIP BACK TO VIETNAM. SO DON'T BY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
2.0,"i disliked that when you even gently toss it onto the ground it stops working.  tried to use it to play a game that if someone tossed it at your feet you would have to dance, but when it hit the ground and it was the front lawn so it was a soft surface it would still just stop working. the batteries compartment is to loose."
2.0,"returned item, very cheap!"
2.0,I received this dress and it was mad out of swimsuit material. The two stars are for the cost and how cute the dress looks. Which it didnt look like I was going scuba diving in a fancy dress
2.0,"Terrible quality, not exactly what I expected. Am not using"
2.0,Unhappy with the quality of the stone.
2.0,"I bought a large because I have read other reviews and they said to size up one. I'm a medium in pants but I got a Large to be safe. Instead I got sent an Extra large size. Not only that but the material of the pants were already falling apart. Too overpriced in my opinion, you can but better quality ones for cheaper elsewhere."
2.0,"This dress was a darker black where as I thought the dress in the photo looked more dark gray. I had to return it because it was sent to me with a hole in the front. I was very disappointed because other than the reasons listed, I was excited to wear it. It was a great length, good quality fabric, and has nice pockets."
2.0,"Its a nice, shiny chain. I like how it fits, the smallest chain is a bit small though and you can't notice the ball design, At first I thought its a nice buy but it changed color quickly"
2.0,The large was a little big and the material isn't what  looked like in the picture.
2.0,"Based on other reviews and the seller's sizing recommendations I bought XL. I usually wear size 6 or 8. I'm 5'3&#34; and have a small waist and large derriere, so like my pants on the roomier side, but these were huge. Both in the hips/waist and the length. I returned them."
2.0,Too tight in waste
2.0,Material is good and soft but runs EXTREMELY small . I got a 2x and it feel like a large !
2.0,Its a waste of money. The material is super cheap and mines came already bent.
2.0,According to the size chart I should be a large and when I received it it was way too big and overwhelming. Wish I got a small. Fir reference I’m 5ft 6 or 7 and normally a size 6-8
2.0,"I bought these thinking they were of the slouchy style like the description and photo say.  They're not.  They were basically just normal shaped beanies.  The inside lining is super soft, but I was specifically wanting a certain style so they were returned."
2.0,I like the look of this item.  After day 2 of wearing it the chain came apart.
2.0,I bought this for a Bridgerton-themed birthday party. It was so thin and practically see-through. I expected better quality for the price. I would up returning it.
2.0,"These are pretty nice. They are light and comfortable for the most part but for someone with a long torso, they just don't work. They are short and have a tendency to not stay put, especially when your moving around. They don't seem to have much compression either. At this point they are just for around the house or maybe bed."
2.0,"I’ve purchased several of these Voboom hats in the past, and the quality in this one is way lower. It looks cheap, not as good as the ones previously purchased."
2.0,"Need to list what the metal is in the product. Not allergic to silicone, but the metal clasp caused an allergic reaction."
2.0,They look ok but keep falling up and out of my ear.
2.0,"Leaves a small gap on the lower, outer edge for both sides."
2.0,"After less than 2 weeks of using this, 1/2 of the picture was worn off"
2.0,Runs very big<br />Much too wide for women
2.0,"Fit as expected, but it’s rough lace and I cannot wear it underneath smooth dresses or rompers- looks crumpled at my hips.<br />Had to return it."
2.0,"I liked the concept of this tank top, but items did not stay in pockets well.<br />If I sat down or moved around very much, my passport and money would work up and out of the pocket. I was constantly worried about losing them, so I ended up not even using it for what I intended. It worked fine for holding my cell phone when I didn't want to hold it<br />I will definitely look for one with a zipper closure for the pockets for future travel"
2.0,"I returned these because there were a few unacceptable things, but I'll start with the positive aspects.  The waist size was fine.  I'm a 33 waist, so I order Large as the size chart indicated, and they fit the waist fine.  I loved the little pocket sewn along the right leg for carrying some small item. the inseam, or length of the shorts, was terrible.  WAY too short.  It was like 4 inches.  So, if I pulled the leg down, then there would be a big gap between the pad and my crotchoidle area, commonly known as the 'taint'. This is where you want the shorts to be more form fitting, so if you pull them up, then you get daisy dukes in length.  Next, I didn't like the way the padding was sewn into the shorts.  It didn't seem to be attached, and slid around inside the material. So it was a struggle to keep the pad under my sit bones."
2.0,I ahould have gotten a size bigger too small
2.0,Didn't help my feet.
2.0,It looks dainty in the picture but it really isn’t. The lotus is rather thick and clunky looking
2.0,Very disappointed it’s only a week old and the face is all blurry my daughter can’t even read the time for the money I spent I’m not happy
2.0,These shorts look like comfy sweats or Terry shorts.  They are neither.  Very disappointing.
2.0,Clasp on long straps has broken on both sides; inside pocket quickly got a hole causing items to get lost in the lining of the bag..Very disappointed
2.0,Runs small. Very soft though.
2.0,"FABRIC: the fabric is quite thin.  Like scarf from dollar store thin.  The print on the fabric is so beautiful (I got the white with big blue roses), I would have kept it.<br />FIT: XL, fit like an XL.  The waistband has elastic on the back only (a nice feeling thick band) and on the front, the band is flat and wide, with a tie in the back.<br /><br />SHAPING: is not good for me at all.  Here's why: 1) the waist doesn't know whether it's Empire or not.  Fit me between my natural waist and rib cage, plus, there are 1&quot; pleats sewn on the band (that's why it's flowy).  Is it too high, or too low?  It's both.  Oh yeah, and there are pleats which makes you look pregnant.  I do have a longer torso and my bulk is not wide but around.  If YOUR shape is are flat from shoulder to shoulder, and you have a shorter waist, this might look great on you.  2) I do have big boobs.  You definitely need a supportive bra, or your boobs will end up on on the waistband.<br /><br />CHEST SEAM: I was pretty disappointed that this is not a crossover surplice, it's just a seam from your cleavage to your waist.  The fabric is not matched all, and my dress's seam does not paint a pretty picture.  One side was cut in a very messy place, and other side didn't have any printing so it just looked a mess.  I didn't think quality control did a decent job at all.<br /><br />Pros: beautiful fabric print.  Breezy and light for hot days.  Affordable.<br />Cons: poor QC on the stitching.  The waist location is definitely not made for the longer waisted, beware of pregnant looking belly.  Fabric thickness is thin and doesn't look like it will withstand being harmed in any way, without a rip or a hole.<br /><br />Finally: I noticed that the pictures show a lot of thinner people with shorter waists so your mileage may vary on that waist.<br /><br />Later:  I went to return this after a few times searching for the return policy.  I finally found it, but when I went to print my return label, I found out that I could not.  &quot;The time for returning has expired.&quot;  I think that is poor customer service especially for a company that is mail order, all across the USA, with no storefront costs.<br /><br />To be honest, it's not worth taking a chance, folks.  Stay away unless you like spending $30 on a dress that no one will take credit for."
2.0,Too small to work properly.  I'll leave it at that
2.0,It is very thin and feels cheap
2.0,"It was enormous. I usually wear an xl, but this xl was extra extra..."
2.0,"I usually buy a large and most shirts on Amazon fit true to size, but this one is tight and the cut outs are not flattering. I am returning instead of exchanging, because the gray also washes a fair skined person out."
2.0,"The material itself is awesome, would I say $100 worth, no. The fit was super weird, not flattering in any way so if you are just looking for something to sit in a dark room by yourself and be comfy, maybe this is for you. I bought a s/m and i am 5'4"" and 122 pounds, it was huge. This is the second Oprah's favorite thing I have bought that is being returned because it did not live up to the hype.... there will be no third time needless to say."
2.0,"It's very unflattering on me so i regret buying this shirt. I have an hourglass figure, so it fans out at my hips in a way that makes me look slightly bigger. Nothing wrong with the shirt, just a fail for online shopping for me."
2.0,Tight is chest if bust size is larger then a A size up<br />Fabric is  lower quality<br />Not as pictured
2.0,"The material and design is nice. However, the top was much too big and the bottoms were almost too small. Returning."
2.0,Some pieces broke off
2.0,"Good  material but runs very small.  I could not use these at all.  Had to return them.  I was going for a fit for 40-42C, These bras were more for maybe 36A.  Do not recommend for full busted women."
2.0,"i bought the blush pants suit for my Grandsons' wedding.  It took forever to deliver and when it came, I was shocked!  The pants are made strange in the crotch and I feel like I am wearing diapers.  The top was way too little in the bust and same had to be taken to a seamstress to modify.  The bust area was way too small for a size 2x.<br /><br />The pants suit is pretty, but the material is a far cry from the price paid.  It is a very cheap rendition of  what is supposed to be ""A Classy pantssuit.""  I would never order it again.  By the time I pay the seamstress, the pantssuit will have cost me way over $170/$175.00."
2.0,"they couldn't get them on my heels and because the shoes were dyed, my bridesmaids had dye all over their hands"
2.0,"I LOVED this dress. So flattering. In fact, my only initial issue was that it didn't have adjustable straps, because it was a little bit too loose around my chest and kept falling down (possibly not the best for small chested gals).<br /><br />I was willing to deal with that, however, because of how beautiful the color and cut was. Unfortunately, I tried it on today for the second time for a wedding I have this weekend, and the stitching on one of the straps came undone.<br /><br />I am so disappointed! It my hope that I can fix it with some mediocre sewing skills but this was definitely a down side to the dress."
2.0,The fit on these gloves was awkward and large. They also did not seem to be very well made. The leather was not sewn on precisely and my fingers hit lining when I slip them in. I don't think the outer material has a very high wool percentage. They feel more cotton than wool and keep my hands warm like a cotton glove. I've tried on wool thinsulate gloves just like these in a store. These are not the quality of the ones I tried on.
2.0,"I don’t mind that this was big on my son. I knew it would be and all he cared about was that it was Cappy. I bought 1 for his Halloween costume. I let him wear it for a day because he was so excited to have it. All he did was take it off a couple of times and put it back on. He was in hysterics by the end of the day. Full meltdown. The stitching that connected the hat rim to the cap was pulling apart.<br />I knew how special this hat was for him and he has Aspergers. He was obsessing over the cap but I didn’t have time to fix it and his Halloween party was getting closer. I decided that instead of going through the potential hassle of returning the cap and possibly getting a replacement, I would just what little money I had put aside for Christmas to go towards getting him another hat.<br />We didn’t use the hat until the night of his party. Casual wear on that one and it started ripping in a similar place.<br />The hat is super cute. It’s the most realistic one I’ve seen. I just wish they lasted longer. Now i’ve Got 2 ripped hats and it says it's too late to exchange them."
2.0,"I wear a size 4p in Ralph Lauren and in Lilly Pulitzer. I always order a size larger for knits to allow scrinkage for drying. I normally wear a small, so I ordered a medium with this shirt. If you are a size &#34;0&#34; or maybe a slim 2 .. The medium will fall nicely. Very cute design, just very sad on the actual size."
2.0,Sharper edges than one I previously bought. Could potentially cut your wrist if it got caught on something. Cute but have to be careful.
2.0,These do not fit a kids ace. Adult fit only.
2.0,"Fit funky, Made me look like a sack of potatoes. Returned."
2.0,"Fabric was a stretchy spandex like material, was not flattering at all, and the cross on the neck you would tie yourself like a halter. I expected better quality, but I suppose it was worth the cost. I wouldn’t buy again and I returned mine."
2.0,This suit is beautiful however it was smaller than expected.  I got a large which I normally wear but I guess I should have gotten an extra large or maybe even a XX large.
2.0,Never did get the right size or something was wrong with it.
2.0,Poor quality. Item looked good on picture but when received top was not attached to bottom portion spinner around and not worth the wait to receive. Purchased as a gift for niece.
2.0,Fit was way too big. Not a fan of the material either.
2.0,"Not as advertised. They are NOT polarized/mirrored. Otherwise first impressions on the quality and packaging is top notch, especially for this price point. It's just in terrible taste that they were advertised as polarized; that's why I bought them. I purchased 3 colors, the blue ones were polarized0"
2.0,Very little compression. I'm 6' and 200lbs and this may be the loosest &#34;medium&#34; that I think I've ever felt in a compression.
2.0,I returned them I was not happy with them.  They are made in China with no previous instigation of this.  I was unhappy.
2.0,"These gloves are so flimsy and thin that it's hard to even get them on. They didn't leak, though, so that's a plus, but I will not buy them again."
2.0,Like that it has a lot of pockets. The only thing is that the zipper is starting to get stuck.
2.0,"The description said it was a two-pack, but only one was in the box.  I really like the arm band and the fact that there was an extra battery.  It is great for walking my dog in the dark.  I will order another one, but this would receive a 5 if two had been received."
2.0,Stitching started coming apart after only one wear. Guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,I’m sure this is cute but it was actually waaaay too big.
2.0,I love the pijamas but they run too small in size.
2.0,Not what I expected to small
2.0,Ok but small
2.0,The sweat pants were too short for me and wasn't what I expected in the material
2.0,"I chose this pant due to a magazine review that was quite favorable done by a short, stocky reviewer who normally wears a 38 waist. He ordered XXL for his fit and the photos showed a rather comfortable looking pant. After looking at the sizing charts, and making a few assumptions about the fit in respect to the two zipped-in liners, I figured my 33 waist would work with the XL. Sure, my waist worked just fine, however, I couldn't even pull the pant legs up over my legs with either one or both of the liners installed. It didn't make sense to buy a pair of pants that were well constructed, including the 2 liners, just to only wear the textile outer layer and relegate the liners to the ""worst idea ever"" box. The pants are nicely made, so 2 stars, but if you have any calf or thigh muscles at all, you most likely will not be able to wear the liners with the pants. If you get them on at all, good luck throwing your leg over the saddle and actually sitting comfortably. If you get a pair to fit over your legs, the inseam for someone under 170 pounds will most likely be pretty long, and the armor won't line up. I am an expert on my own opinion, which is based on personal experience(s). Others may disagree, but simply ordering a size or two larger will not cure the massive amount of material stuffed into the pant legs."
2.0,My daughter is a pretty normal shaped 7 year old and the cut on this leotard was strange. Buyer beware. But at least it was very easy to return and find something better.
2.0,longer than my expectation.. just OK
2.0,Had to re-order 3x...cause the dam thing fell off my nose n got lost 3x..I squeezed it to death on my nose too so it wouldn't fall off..n it they still got lost!!!
2.0,Improper backs to the earrings which make them fall off.
2.0,"The holes make this impossible for me to wear. I’m 5’7”, 140 pound with full hips, booty, and thighs. This dress is so cute and fits my body wonderfully UNTIL YOU GET TO THE BUTT. Because of the little pattern and where it falls, you can see the lower half of my butt, so back this goes. I wanted to like this so badly, as it is really cute and comfortable, but I’m only 5’7” and my butt is out so if you’re any taller, steer clear."
2.0,Cheap quality.  Not sure they are more than plain plastic lenses.
2.0,"This is a shapeless shirt,  or even pretty tucked in.  To me it looked boxy and like an oversized male shirt."
2.0,"Ordered for my daughter, we loved the design but it was sewn together poorly. We weren’t expecting perfection but seems under the armpits were not finished, one strap was significantly longer than the other, fringe uneven, and more. We returned it. Really doubt this would have lasted the night."
2.0,"This average-quality leather product needs to be kept in your lab jacket pocket. It stains easily when it comes in contact with water or other alcohol based cleaners commonly used in medical exam rooms.  While it looks much nicer than common vinyl prescription covers, it's durability is unimpressive and limits the professional presentation for which one would hope. I'm not buying another one. Pass the shoe polish!"
2.0,"The star won't stay hooked to the moon and it always goes loose so eventually, it just fell off my neck and because it's so tiny I never even noticed((  It's cute tho."
2.0,"Its a bit costume-ish jewlery looking at first. Like when you first take it out of the box. But after a good long while after youve seen the reciever wearing it for a long while, it does start to grow on you. And it becomes easier on the eyes. Untill 3 days later when the little black metal bar that links the squares togeather breaks or gets loosened and falls out and youve got two big chunks of chain and nothing more to do with em."
2.0,"This was the second time that I purchased these exact ones and the style and brand were different. They look less heart-shaped, are much smaller, and have super dark lenses. Definitely not as cute as my first pair, which looked as depicted."
2.0,The cut of this piece is more for a Junior or teen. It did not fit my arms or shoulders.
2.0,"I returned this blazer. There was nothing wrong with it material or production wise, it was very flimsy and really short though. I was looking for it to be somewhat of a statement piece to freshen up anow all black outfit but it just looked sloppy."
2.0,The bag is super cute and feels great. But after a few days the brown stuff is gummy and melts off the bag. It's getting on the bag itself and other items I own and has ruined my clothing. Going to return today and hopefully mine was just defective
2.0,This item had been made larger than the previous two that I ordered and an 1/4 inch makes a big difference under small hat bans.  You have to waste time trying to cut that off.
2.0,"These earrings were so pretty! Only issue is the backs did not stay on... and none of my other backs from other earrings would fit. Unfortunately, I was not able to wear them ."
2.0,"Sized very small, Xlarge was too small compared to regular Xlarge"
2.0,"I was pumped to find these loud orange golf pants to go chop up some turf in... unfortunately they failed on many fronts. First, I noticed some black marks on the pocket where my phone was. I thought maybe I brushed up on something and tried to wash them, it didn’t come out. On my second outing more marks showed up! Then I saw a mark where my money clip was in my other pocket... finally after my round I notice black discoloration on the butt presumably from the cart seat... additionally after washing delicately the waist shrunk and was tight. Finally the fabric is a nightmare for wrinkles. If you so much as sit these will look like a mess. I’ll continue my search for some good obnoxious golf pants."
2.0,These run extremely small. The color was horrible! I usually wear a large and own 3 pairs of their leggings and a pair of shorts in large! These fit like a small.  The waist was beyond tight! The legs were suffocating my thighs and this gave me the worst lower belly pouch I’ve ever seen in any pair workout bottoms ever!<br /><br />Would not recommend the army green color at all! Sizing isn’t consistent in all the color ways so I would recommend ordering your usual size and a size up.<br /><br />Waist:30<br />Hips:42<br />Size purchased: large<br />Usual size: large
2.0,"Tank is definitely not the greatest quality and will likely need to be carefully hand-washed and hung to dry. It's the lack of hemming that makes it so delicate. Love the design-- I just think this is more like a $7-10 tank, not $17 or whatever I paid. I'd return it if I didn't already take tags off, honestly. It's definitely going to fall apart."
2.0,It was nice but it ran small I got an extra large and it was more like 38 size. Had to return it.
2.0,Very thin. Not great for winter in N.Y.
2.0,"The shipping time was decent. The product however, it quickly fell apart. The card slots ripped and I was soon searching for another wallet. The zip for the change compartment was very hard to work. Although it didn't matter, coins were constantly falling out. I recommend finding a different one."
2.0,The comfort was nothing like described in the reviews!!
2.0,"My daughter started having heel pains after wearing those, sole is not shock absorbent enough"
2.0,Pretty but fits small. Will either return it or motivate me to lose weight quickly quickly
2.0,"Love the printing and design, but socks are rough and do not fit well at all. They’re like a tube instead of contoured for heel, toe, ankle etc."
2.0,"The shoe fits, however the back slides off my daughters heel so much that she cannot wear these. The strap has a small piece of Velcro to close the strap, but it’s too short to actually make an adjustment to tighten it up. Very cute shoe that I will have to get creative with and fix or it will be a waste of money. They also have a weird smell."
2.0,"This shirt is very pretty, and I love the pattern on it. I am giving it 2 stars because it fits so weird.  It bunches up by the neckline and won't lie flat.  If I pull the front flat it bunches up by the neck in the back.  I haven't washed it yet, so I'm hoping when I wash it it will flatten out a bit.  It's very stretchy and when you pull it down to fit at the neck it just kind of bounces back up.  I think the pattern of it was cut weird.  Maybe if I had ordered a smaller size it would fit tighter around the boobs and not be so loose at the top.  I normally wear a small and that is what I ordered.  I'm disappointed in this shirt.  If anything changes when I wash it I will update my review."
2.0,"These earrings were so disappointing! They have such vibrant colors and are lightweight, and comfortable to wear. However, after owning them for just a few months, they are coming apart! The earrings are made of two layers of leather material and they have split. Only about 2 of the 9 pairs are still in tact. So depressing! I have tried to glue them back together but it does not work."
2.0,"The bag is beautiful and functional, but it arrived with a bugspray-type odor that has made it impossible for me to use.  The smell fills my car and gives me a sore throat--so I definitely don't want it around my baby.  Professional cleaning cut the smell by about half, but it's still too stinky to use."
2.0,Feet were cold in these. Maybe good for summer wear.
2.0,Definitely not the size the tag said.
2.0,Runs small. Pick a size or two bigger.
2.0,this was  gift
2.0,"Sizing is terribly off, I'm 5'6&#34; & 115 lbs with a 26 inch waist.  I ordered a small (my normal size) large & xl due to the previous reviews of this product.  The waist size on almost all of them was near the same, the only real difference was the length.  It is not what I would call mopping length in your true size, it hit about my ankle area.  All the hems were uneven, I returned all of the sizes"
2.0,Nice fabric and construction but sizing is completely wrong from published chart
2.0,it was cheaply made
2.0,Cool cat eye glasses. Only 2 ☆☆.  I bought these to replace an exact pair i had purchased previously that my son sat down on and broke. The red frame on these are more of a pale burgundy rather than the bright glossy red I had initially bought.
2.0,Just don't like they way they look.
2.0,Super cheap looking!  This is plastic made to look like metal.  They are much smaller then what you feel they should be.
2.0,When washed 1 sock shrunk way done and the other did not. These run extremely small
2.0,"Poorly made garment, runs small, plastic zipper makes shirt look cheap."
2.0,"I use high quality lens for several hobby purposes. This is a poor quality product falsely described, but it is a great price for what is delivered.<br /><br />The low quality glass optics magnify about 10-power, maybe a bit more. It's perfectly fine for casual use, an environment where one would not want to take an expensive lens, or certainly for a child.<br /><br />If it were accurately described by the seller, this would rate five stars! Since it described falsely: ""This extremely powerful Jeweler's Loupe is 3 times more powerful than the average (10X) louple"", I have to give a low rating. Liar, liar, pants on fire.<br /><br />Still a great value though, just know what you're getting.<br /><br />FYI. If you are really looking the highest quality lens, make certain it is a ""Hastings Triplet"" which will provide chromatic and distortion correction. These are quite expensive and are only available in smaller sizes, so be sure to read the specifications carefully for the lens size and field of view. Bausch & Lomb, Edmund Scientifics, and Belomo [[ASIN:B000EHLU8U BelOMO 10x Triplet Loupe Folding Magnifier with attached BelOMO Logo Lanyard]] come to mind as reputable manufacturers of quality magnifying lens."
2.0,I do not like that they are not smooth to the touch
2.0,It is not worht spending on this  it does not even woth..... very poor quality
2.0,The top of the shirt bunches really bad under the arms. It’s pretty unflattering.
2.0,"Nice shoe, order double the size shoe you wear, shoes are very tight if you have big feet forget it"
2.0,"do not use the size chart!! its a joke for this dress! it is cut very straight from the top to bottom, no curve to allow for anyone with a bootie!<br />the quality is fine, the fabric seems to be one that will wrinkle easily... do not use the size chart they have on the website! it is not correct! These are made for little people... the woman in the picture must be a double zero. It is a little bit see-through.... just to where you would need a slip or something underneath"
2.0,After just three uses the material started to develop pulls and fraying is clearly evident.  These probably will not last long.
2.0,"This garment should be marked &#34;Oversized&#34;... Loved the material and quality, but I would have ordered two sizes smaller to get a loose fit that didn't swallow me up..."
2.0,It’s okay for what I paid for it the letter were small but for a quick wear okay
2.0,you get two pairs with is order. I was expecting more than that for some reason. They technically are what's advertised but I was surprised to see what low quality they were. They aren't the high quality I was hoping for. I have yet to wear them but I can say they are definitely on the thin side. Don't expect them to last long.
2.0,This would have been beautiful if there was a sash included to cinch the waist or buttons) in the front to make it more fitted. It looked like I was wearing a sack.
2.0,"It was ok but not my style and the material wasn't what I expected, so I rrturned it."
2.0,"Something definitely went wrong with the printing/silk screening of this shirt. Huge lines through image, letters choppy at the bottom. Not worth anywhere near $16.99. Maybe they were going for a vintage look, but this looks like defect."
2.0,It worked for a couple weeks and then disintegrated.
2.0,"I really liked these earrings initally- they're very sparkly and perfect for everyday wear at the office. I noticed when I first put them on that the posts are very short- it is difficult to get the backs far enough onto the posts without really pinching my ears, and the backs don't &#34;click&#34; into place (i.e. no tension, they just slide). Note: I have very small ears and normal-to-thin lobes. I've had several compliments on them, but I am always having to adjust the backs so that they don't hurt and the backs don't fall off. Just now one fell out, apparently the back must have fallen off earlier because it's nowhere to be found. Though these are nice-looking, I now can't wear them without buying new backs, so I'm pretty disappointed. Would have rated these a 5 based on looks alone, but for $30 I only got to wear them for 6 weeks.... :/"
2.0,Nice look. Way too small went back
2.0,"They were to long for a 32 inch fit, they were at best a $10 pair of pants if that. Would not recommend these to anyone at the price requested by manufacturer."
2.0,Very thin and broke within dats
2.0,The sweatpants were nice quality but I received the wrong color I got the Black ones instead of the gray I ordered
2.0,returned the item. not great quality and a bit too scheer.
2.0,My head fits most one size fits all stretch caps however this one is way too small. Very unfortunate because I like the hat. Seems like a youth sized cap.
2.0,Nice dress<br />To small<br />Hard to return<br />Had to go to ups office to return<br />And get mailing label to return
2.0,"For the money... These are perfect. Not thin, Not too heavy. Very soft feel. Seam down the inside of the leg (hence the 13 dollars for 3 pairs!)<br />I have thin long legs and at first I thought they might be too wide. (126 ls 5'7&#34;) But they feel comfortable on.<br />I will update this review  if they don't wash well. But they are not nearly as delicate as pantyhose and I think washed in a garment bag in a front load washer, washing will not be an issue.<br /><br />Really happy. If they hold up I will re order. I live in skirts and leggings with wool socks in the winter.  These should work out well.<br /><br />Update - these leggings, after 1-2 wearings and washings, just don't stay up. Will not buy again. too bad!"
2.0,I will not order from this company again
2.0,"Loved them, but diamond eye fell out after wearing once.  :("
2.0,"Not very thick leather, wore a hole in them the first day I wore them splitting wood."
2.0,Glue left from whoever hot glued this together. Still pretty cute thiugh
2.0,"I ordered two of the “150” size shirts on the same day, same time, same order. One is perfect for my petite 12 year old. This one, however, may be too small for my 8 year old! Waaaaay off on sizing."
2.0,"most covid mask are for profit only, not as a precautionary product"
2.0,The bottom hem is too small.
2.0,Ordered XL no where near to fit me....
2.0,"I have gotten several pairs of these pants over the years.  My only complaint is that they are not consistent with sizing -- usually in length.  In this case, the waist was over an inch smaller than the size.  Sent them back..."
2.0,Horrible quality. Very thin material and cheaply made. Seams ripped after put in modafin a few times to swim. It only lasted about a month of the summer. I don’t recommend buying it. The bathing suit is very cheaply made too. My daughter wanted this for her 9 th birthday and hardly wore it. She only liked the tail not the suit.
2.0,Was excited about these pants i took all the measurements to get the right size but no luck.. They where still too small. Returned these
2.0,Too noisy on hard wood and ceramic floor....
2.0,"The pants got fuzz balls all over them the first time I washed them. I used a sweater shaver to get them off, but they are back again. Any little piece of lint or anything sticks to them and they’re just made of bad material."
2.0,"I was trying to use this for Skimming, and surfing. And, it was way too tight to put on, and hard to breathe in it."
2.0,"I was sad when this dress came in. I’m normally a size 2xl but this was too small on the chest area still. It’s also a cheap fabric and not the same color that bright fuscia pink pictured. It’s also a rough texture, not silky as pictured. Overall a disappointing purchase."
2.0,Disappointed with how small this mask is. This mask is more for a 5 year old child or younger.
2.0,"I’m 5’7, 190, 36DD and the XL was too tight and shorter than it looks on the model. The material is soft stretchy jersey but thin so it showed bra lines, imperfections... like my post partum baby bump I was looking to hide. Nice color but Returning."
2.0,Fake pockets with actual pocket lining inside?! Would love functional pockets. I think opening th fake ones would ruin the shirt. Stupid
2.0,Fits a little small and I didn't like the color (too country western) so I bleached it and destressed the jacket. Much better now but still isn't a good fit
2.0,"I purchased this shirt for myself as I liked the unusual neck line.  It arrived on time and nicely packaged.  The fit was odd though in the front- the strips that make up the neckline are sewn in a odd angle/way and unless you enjoy pulling on your shirt every 2 minutes to stop them from bunching up, it would not lay flat as shown in the picture.  I ended up giving this to my teenage daughter to wear and she seems to be enjoying it more than I did though she too has issues with the way the shirt lays."
2.0,"Bodysuit fit well. Mask was not in the box. I hope they see this and send me a mask. Im afraid if I return it, I wont get another back in time or another mistake happens."
2.0,"Shortly after I got this the seam separated in the armpit. It is nice looking and fit well, maybe even a little big but unfortunately you take that risk when you have such flimsy clothing."
2.0,did not have as much stretch as an old school baseball tee would have had. stiff.
2.0,"I am a true 2xl, and I am always so hesitant to get clothes from Amazon since I have had previously ordered and the fit was way too small. I read these reviews and they said it fit as expected. This fits like a large, the buttons were not even coming close to closing. It hit above my hips which I hate short shirts. My daughter can fit in it luckily, It is a really nice shirt in a wine color, love the pleating but is no way this a tunic or the correct size."
2.0,"The back to one of the earrings was too big and wouldn't stay on so I tried replacing it with other backs that I had and none of them would fit. It was like they made the earring too slender so none of the backs would stay on. They just slid right off. I also have really small ears so even on the shortest whole, the spiked jacket still hung down too far for my liking. My husband wasn't a fan of them either. They were really heavy so they hurt my ears. I wore them out with my husband one day just to give them a chance and I ended up pulling then out of my ears because they hurt and we're uncomfortable. I really wish these could have worked out because they looked super cute on here."
2.0,"It's a great size and length, but I specifically made sure to check if it was nickel free and the description says stainless steel yet it gave me a really bad itchy red rash all around me neck. Not very happy"
2.0,They are so much smaller then I expected
2.0,"its nice, i havnt wore it yet and i looked at it this morning all the metal lost its color and looks reddish black now."
2.0,I would like to return them. I thought they where darker lens and fit over my glasses.
2.0,Fabric is thin and the torso is wayy too short. Get 3 sizes bigger!!  I'm 5'9 and it's a crop top.
2.0,"Very poor quality, the cloth is very thin so I suppose it breathes!  Don't dry in hot dryer as the small amount of lycra ""melts"" and they become unwearable.  Will not buy again, am hoping an american company will start making underwear again, women's too.  sick and tired of paying so much for chinese garbage."
2.0,The dress is ok quality but very large. Order down.
2.0,I've been bamboozled. These are not touch screen compatable. I tried different pressure and different screens. These are cute and warm but do not work for my phone which is a disappointment
2.0,The plastic flowers on the pants were coming off the pants. Not happy with the patches come off.
2.0,"Very small, vanity sizes."
2.0,Not a fan. I normally wear a 4 and ordered the small and they are too big everywhere except my waist.
2.0,Ordered the royal blue first. It fit perfectly. Decided to get the black and it was to small. The shirt fit fine but the shorts didn't make it pass my thighs. Didnt think to try it on before I packed because i was pleased with the blue .Same out different color different fit.
2.0,"I returned it, felt rough inside and not soft, too bad it really looked cute"
2.0,"I bought this swimsuit for my daughter and we loved it at first. The fit is great and seemed to be great quality. However she’s only worn it a few times this summer the the seams in the front have come apart. There is no way to fix this with out it being very noticeable because the suit is fully lined. Very disappointed with this purchase, as I except better quality from Land’s End.  It’s now outside the return window so we are stuck with it. I would not recommend this particular suit to anyone."
2.0,I went with the reviews and bought it but when it came in the second necklace is so fake and sparkly looking I just couldn't wear this.
2.0,"So I took this dress on vacation, the minute I put it on, first wear the strap broke off as soon as it touched my shoulder. Pretty print and flow but come on, sew it on better. I'll have to do it myself since I dont have the package to return."
2.0,"Very soft and comfortable, however stretched out so quick, now so huge they drag the floor and arms fall off. I will try the size small and hope it works better."
2.0,"The Belt is pretty thin to be called ""Survival"" and the storage belt is plastic."
2.0,metal turned green. Something fun for little girls for couple weeks.
2.0,The snake print cardigan did not look like the pic. The inside was solid white - returner it. Disappointed.
2.0,"The blouse is kind of stiff, so it doesn't drape nicely."
2.0,I do not like the feel of the material and it is too small.
2.0,Much shorter in length then what was advertised - cute -
2.0,The balls kept falling off and the ring wouldn't close tight around them no matter how hard I tried.
2.0,"This is not like the picture! It is not made of soft airy material, it is made of think polyester type of material. I bought 2 and am sending both back as they are on not like the picture."
2.0,"bracelet was smaller than expected , crystals are not transparent."
2.0,Cute but off a little true to size
2.0,"Purchased these for my recent trip abroad to put in my carryon bag, purse, and backpack. They are sturdy and strong and I’m sure the durability is great. The 2 stars is because it didn’t do what I needed: keeping the air tags in place. They just would fall or pop out randomly. Ultimately, I added a piece of tape to keep it in place. I could have just put the airbag in the bags loose instead. Disappointed."
2.0,"I have been buying Brooks for over 7 year, even same style and this pair has been the worst. Still causes blisters after over 100 miles. Feel like brooks have been going downhill (no pun intended) in general."
2.0,Ok I guess!
2.0,"They're made of a comfortable material, but feel a bit on the small side and the legs constantly ride up throughout the day. They need constant adjustment throughout the day in order to be comfortable and not have all of the material in the leg rolled up next to your crotch."
2.0,What I received is not what was pictured.
2.0,"Low quality band, got to be carefully when wearing it on because it may break the laze who join everything together."
2.0,Too complicated.
2.0,I am a straight size Medium.  It is way to small.  The description said it was true to size.  I am gave it to a friend who is  very petite.  It fit her fine.  The material is very nice.
2.0,"These socks are pretty,<br /><br />These socks are soft and comfortable and pretty.  I am giving them a low rating because on the third wearing of my favorite color I gardened for a couple hours.  When I took my shoes off the heels of both socks were gone.  They had not been snagged or damaged in any way.  The fabric just seems too fragile for active outdoor work."
2.0,"I bought this to bring to the hospital for the birth of my baby. I am typically a medium size and even eight months pregnant this is still very large on me. I think it will serve its purpose at the hospital, but will probably not wear it again. The fabric is rough and it fits big."
2.0,"you are claiming that it has a rotating or spinning center it does not rotted<br />I use size 12 but it fields a bit tight , if you wearer a size 12 you need to order size 13"
2.0,"I ordered the XL and I wear a size 12, it was too short, and tight."
2.0,"Very Small Stones, some of them are cheap synthetic."
2.0,Comfy fabric but it's so large it's shapeless on me; I'm going to attempt to shrink it in the wash and will update then but it fits and looks like a nightgown.
2.0,"So cute, but one of the earrings came broken. It would cost me more to return the item than it did buying them. Hoping I can fix it :("
2.0,"Chest size and length are correct; however, there is no room to move shoulders, and sleeves are too tight."
2.0,Cute for<br />Cheap<br />Jewelry
2.0,Returned.  Pattern was faded and looked inexpensive.
2.0,Retuned this item.  The pattern in person does not really look like the picture.
2.0,Needed this for a last minute party. This ran so small in size I had to borrow my daughters waist trainer in order to zip it all the way. I definitely consider myself a small/medium gal but Jesus this was like xs/s and it was so uncomfortable for my party. Looked good though
2.0,This is okay... its cheap quality. It was a bit small and w/ the first washing the pads basically get all sorts of screwed up.
2.0,Very cheap material and see through… it’s not the same at the picture the picture shows it longer it shorter what it shows and and the sleeves show longer and loose and it’s the opposite it’s not that bad to keep but I expect to get what I saw in the Amazon pictures ….got a medium size and I’m 7 months pregnant fits ok
2.0,Is is pretty but the ends fall off so easily and i glued on the hearts end now i lost the other 🔚 am so dissatisfied
2.0,Almost all of the adjustable buttons are broken after just a couple of uses.
2.0,"I did not  measure my daughters height before purchasing, so this is entirely my own fault. If you are a lazy shopper like I am, these run a bit small for an average eight year old. They fit for the waist, but height was above my daughters ankles."
2.0,They were extremely small. They were given to my son who is wheelchair bound. Ordered a larger size and they weren’t that comfortable. He’s going to use another company.  They are attractive but not functional for him.
2.0,Didn't love them. Returned.
2.0,"It would be a nice bra, but the straps are EXTREMELY long."
2.0,"I actually thought it was such a nice robe, so I returned the first one I ordered (a little too snug for a robe, since I prefer loose fitting evening wear), and I ordered a larger size.  I didn't wear it that often, but within the first month, the plastic zipper came apart and there isn't any way to fix it.  For the price paid for a 'Miss Elaine' product, I expected much better quality!!!"
2.0,"I bought these for my cat loving granddaughter. They were big for a 2 year old and have a permanent and annoying sticker on the lens. I thought it was removable, but it is permanent."
2.0,One works one doesn't 😐
2.0,"It's okay for the price. The picture looks way different than in person. Don't love the picture, ariel's facs is disappointing"
2.0,"Sized up and they are still small. They snap back into shape after washing though, so that's a plus!"
2.0,Nice color but larger than expected and very flowy.  Has to be worn with a sports bra.
2.0,They were really think material ... the kind of material that sticks to your skin on winter days because your legs are so dry. Too long
2.0,"All three of the masks are a different size.  The product description did not state that they would be different sizes. However, they are decently made."
2.0,"Somewhat disappointed with this product which I recently received.  Thought for the price it would be a high-quality watch band, and that's what I was expecting.  Instead the cross-stitching seemed somewhat frayed on one side (was there no quality control in sending this out?), and the overall length was quite long, although it was not indicated as an &#34;long&#34; band.  Will need to add an additional hole to get a proper fit.  The quality of the leather seems fine.  I likely won't send this back, but will not re-order another band from this manufacturer."
2.0,"Was super excited when I Received this body chain.....somehow it looks uncompleted especially the the part that goes around your waist is missing chainlink and a hook/latch. Had to buy a chainlink with closure to attach to the bottom part. After a night out, the neck area turned black! Boomer guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,It fits weird
2.0,"Unfortunately, the plastic hooks are very flimsy. After less than a month of use one side broke. Disappointed."
2.0,Came quickly and was a style I was wanting but unfortunately mine came with two substantial holes in the shirt. Having to return it.
2.0,The shoes did not conform well to my baby’s foot.
2.0,"Received as a gift, in my opinion this charm looks better in the picture. It is not a puffed heart. I think it is over-priced."
2.0,"Loved it until it broke on the third day of wear. I even took it out while sleeping just to be safe, but that didn’t matter. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
2.0,I just thought the high-low hemline was too extreme. It fit fine in every way but it was much too short in the front for my comfort. I am sending it back.
2.0,Very flimsy and poorly made! China!!
2.0,"The quality of the pants were great, however they run small. I ordered a 3xl and it looks like a regular extra large."
2.0,This look nice and are just right size but screw fastener is to small to hold and could be bigger.
2.0,Glasses came bent. Had to return.
2.0,"I got this shirt because it was cute and the product page said it was 100% cotton. WRONG! This is NOT cotton—not one bit! The fabric content is 35% viscose (a type of rayon), 60% polyester and 5% Spandex. This T-shirt is zero percent cotton; 100% synthetic. I couldn’t even leave it on, because it felt so creepy.<br /><br />When I tried it on long enough to check the sizing, I found it was oversized. Since it’s not cotton, it won’t shrink. In fact, it’s very stretchy, so you might be able to get a size or two smaller than usual. Since it’s partly rayon, you can’t dry it in a machine; you have to line dry it. This totally defeats the purpose of having a casual T-shirt.<br /><br />If it was cotton, it would be beautiful. It’s more of a forest green heather, which I loved. The design with the white dandelion and “Spread kindness” lettering in light pastel colors is gorgeous. The decal is firmly adhered to the fabric. The seams and hem are tightly and evenly stitched. If it were cotton, the price of $12-15 would be perfect. Sadly, though, I wouldn’t buy something made of such unhealthy materials at any cost."
2.0,"The color is very pretty. The design is beautiful. However, the material is not really what I expected it to be as it was definitely not as soft as I imagined.  I ordered a large thinking it would be a little big on me but it wasn’t. It is not very flattering on me.  I was so excited to get it but I haven’t worn it yet.  I bummed because I thought this was going to be an amazing shirt based on some of the reviews.  I don’t like to give bad reviews but this shirt was not everything I expected it to be."
2.0,These earrings are very flimsy and they will not stay in place as you see in the picture.they keep falling out of place. DIsappointed.
2.0,Cheap material - nothing like the apple bands that originally come with your watch....everything sticks to this!!
2.0,Fell apart after using it for 2 months. You get what you paid for.
2.0,Loved this but no elastic at chest line. Material is great but smashes down my boobs way too much :/
2.0,The balls would come out really easy when eating
2.0,cute but doesn't fit.
2.0,Designed for a tall torso. Not for short and stout.
2.0,Glasses came broken.  They have a very cheap feel to them.
2.0,You get what you pay for. Looks cheap pics are misleading
2.0,Smaller than I expected. Probably better for piercings other than ears
2.0,"Looks great in the picture. Two things: 1) HUGE. I admit to skinny wrists, but I regularly wear men's digital watches and bigger women's watches - this is a whole different story. If the band were softer and had holes small enough for a woman's wrist, maybe it'd be okay, but neither is the case. 2) You have to press a button to see the time. Every time! If you're running through a building with coffee in one hand and briefcase/files in the other hand, how are you supposed to press a button to see the time? Absolutely would not have wanted if I had known. Also, when you do press the button, it says ""Black Dice"" before showing you the time. Blech. This should be considered jewelry for a large-wristed woman or man, not an actual watch."
2.0,"Very thin, not sewn well, Cheaply made. The ties and kinda funny-the whole shirt feels weird. It doesn't stay on the shoulders, flips up too much. Uncomfortable and irritated the whole time I had it on."
2.0,I like the bracelet but it fell apart after I wore it the 2nd time. It might be jewelry but now a jeweler can't repair it. The strap doesn't close anymore and came completely unwound. Would not purchase from this seller again.
2.0,It was to small and I dont like the material it's made with cuz 8t clings to u and its fusterating on an extremely hot day
2.0,"I bought 2 of these for my toddlers. Different sizes, they are true to size. They are really cute. But when I ordered these, I expected them to be thicker, warm sweat material & cotton. They are very thin so much thatvthey are see through. They are silk & they wore them out yesterday in 90° weather without a sweat. So.. these will not hold up when it gets cold. I could have bought the same exact 2pc. Cotton, warm thick material for about $4 more. I would have much rather paid that in our local shopping centers than this. So if your going just for looks, purchase. If you need to keep your kids warm I would say do not buy this."
2.0,"Very cute, soft as butter, but my 9 month old granddaughter won't wear these booties until she is 2 or 3.  Since we love them for their feel will keep them until she can wear them."
2.0,"The shoulders were too wide, otherwise it would have been great. Had to return the item at my cost."
2.0,Beautiful dress but way too big.  Would like a size medium but not in stock.  I am returning this dress.  Material is very nice though and colors are beautiful.  Wish I could buy it in a smaller size
2.0,"In person, the gloves are cheap looking, although they came in a lovely presentation folder that had my hopes up.  I sent them back.  Yuck."
2.0,Ordered XL size for 15 inch calves - could not wear more than 4-5 hours. Colors very vibrant - received in timely manner.
2.0,Makes your socks fall down. Sketchers are better
2.0,Worked well at first but after a few uses the shoe end stripped and would not tighten to the extension shaft. I would not recommend for a regular use.
2.0,This product was cheaply made the straps were very thick and so much fabric made it look like a moomoo
2.0,Not. Lot right down the middle no bling when you put it on there is a black gap no bling don't look good and they claim a white cover on inside not their very thin material not able to get refund or return
2.0,"I love big earrings, but these are a bit over the top. They kept falling off my ears. They are heavier too."
2.0,It was too small and I didn't like how it fit. It seemed to be all over the place. Returned it.
2.0,I was Disappointed with this purchase  because their were no directions included. Also the mask did not protect me from germs because it was not secure to the face .
2.0,"I bought these sunglasses in February and have worn them nearly daily since. They always go in the case when I'm not wearing them and unfortunately the logos on the side have started to come loose. I contacted Montana West hoping that they would stand by their products since it's only been 3 months that I've had them but they do not help with products that were purchased on line. I'm very disappointed that the product that I paid $30 for should fall apart before a $5 pair of sunglasses would, even though I have treated them with great care."
2.0,I ordered these for my wedding day since i was going to be walking on gravel and grass. I was wearing a standard stiletto pump and these fit perfect. The only downfall was when i was standing at the alter my heel kept sinking in to the grass! By the time I got to take my shoes off my heel had punctured through the heel protector and was useless at that point. If you are wanting these for walking on grass I would not recommend especailly if you are a bride!
2.0,The quality of fabric seemed nice but the length of the skirt was much shorter than expected.  You could actually see about an inch or more of the bottoms when my hope was for this suit to cover my upper thighs to some degree.  My only other complaint is with the bra cups. I am a small C and the cups were just completely awkward and made a cone like appearance.  I ended up returning this product and going with another suit that was exactly what I was looking for.
2.0,Kind of poor quality for the price
2.0,"As directed by my vein specialist, I needed 20-30 mmHg graduated compression socks. I measured the largest part of my calves and they were 19"", which the the largest end on the XL size. So, they were the right size and compression, and were cute, I got them. I was so horrified while putting on the first pair! Not only were they almost impossible to get on my foot, I'm shocked they didn't split when I pulled them up...which was an even greater feat than getting them over my heel. Once I got them on (finally), I left them on for a while. That was short-lived. They left the deepest indention in my leg, just below my knee. They're supposed to be compression socks, not a tourniquet!  At my best guess, I'd say that the XL fits a max circumference of 16-17"" and no more. And if you're picky about the fabric, know that these have a very heavy sheen to them, especially when putting them on.  I love the colors and designs; I really hate that I had to send them back."
2.0,Will be returning.  A very large large and also very wide.
2.0,This is nothing more than a huge piece of shiny plastic made to look like a shoulder bag. The only stylish thing about it is the decorative gold lock. It is definitely NOT worth the money for the price!
2.0,Pretty but useless for sun glare
2.0,Buy a warranty if its offered.  Disappointed
2.0,"Good quality but small torso and crotch. Order a size up, 5’7” 130 lbs ordered a medium and it was slipping from top to bottom! Missed the window for return"
2.0,It’s cute and all but it didn’t fit ima lil bigger than I thought Or it runs small
2.0,This dress is very cheaply made and the pockets are just embroidery
2.0,"Bigger then you think , fits like regular rings and I have fat fingers , pretty thou"
2.0,The shirt is not true to size....it was too big on me.  The sizes run bigger.  The fabric is very thin also.  I wanted to return the item for a smaller size but to return the item cost 4 x more than what I paid for it.
2.0,"I was really excited for this skirt, but when it got her it was so incredibly small that I couldn't even get it up over my thighs. I usually wear a small or a medium so I figured the medium would be a perfect size for me. Nope! I  would have needed an XL for it to work for me. It's a good thing my sister is a twig cause it fit her perfectly. She's rather short and weighs barely over 100 pounds. The small would have been definitely been to small for her as well. Size up when you purchase this!"
2.0,These earrings are cute but very cheap. Possibly worth the $8 for 2 but I’m far from impressed with their quality. Disappointed because I was really hoping to get leather not PU leather or what ever this material is
2.0,"They look good but the two closest to your toes hurt my feet so bad I am constantly adjusting my shoe. I am going to try to flip the bottom 2 and put them on wrong. If it doesnt feel better, I will remove them from my shoes."
2.0,"The dress is actually lovely but the sizing was way off. It was way too small. I checked the size chart,  ordered a 4XL and it was way to small for me. It did fit a friend of mine who is a medium.  Overall, I am very disappointed because the sizing was so off. Pretty dress through."
2.0,"I have worn them a couple of times.  They are super cute but the breaking in process has been a bit hard.  The heel rubs, which I have never had in a strap on wedge sandal before, so I had to add a pad to the small space to not let my heel get blistered.  The top of the shoe closer to your leg also presses on the top of your foot, with little, to no give.  I am hoping that as I wear them more, this will stretch out a bit to be more comfortable..."
2.0,Not the greatest quality.
2.0,"Very cheap quality, back breaks off very easily."
2.0,"This is stuff is impossible to use. In the description is says &#34;Rub the wax between your thumb and forefinger until melted.&#34; It never melts, just deforms. If you try to comb it through, it looks like you have beard dandruff. Not recommended unless your looking for really dry, hard wax. And even then...lol."
2.0,"This mask is very thick, soft and puffy, which sounds good on paper, but isn't so good in practice. It doesn't conform to the face so some light gets in. If you like to sleep on your side the mask has a thick edge, so it shifts and digs into your face or eye. I imagine it might be pretty hot being so thick, but that didn't bother me, probably because I couldn't keep it on very long. I'm a bit disappointed!"
2.0,"The dress in the picture appears to be a full circle skirt. This dress in reality has a circumference of about 120&#34;. A full circle skirt of the same length would give you about 220&#34; circumference. Even with a petticoat underneath it hangs almost straight down, no fullness or twirl-ability as the picture would leave you to believe. I laid it out flat so you can see how narrow the skirt actually is. They seem to have made a dress to take the picture, and then make all  the dresses they actually sell with literally half the fabric. The fabric itself is fine, sort of a thin flannel. It smelled horrible upon arrival, but a quick wash fixed that. There was a small hole in one of the seams, and some loose threads sticking out in places. I have a 28&#34; waist and the waist band was not nearly long enough to tie a cute bow in. I ordered an XL (I normally get M) after reading some reviews, and even then my chest (32B) is awkwardly cramped on the top. I am very disappointed."
2.0,Wasn't really red. More of a dark orange.
2.0,"Love the shorts, the stitching on the pockets is rubbish!! After the second wash the stitching comes undone."
2.0,didn't like the connection to the fitbit.  Unsecure connection.
2.0,Much cheaper quality than a very similar pair purchased. Also runs small.
2.0,"This swim suit is absolutely cute. I purchased for each my daughter. I found that this item is very small to size.<br /><br />My African American daughter is busty and with bottoms, so the product fit a little snug.  But she still received numerous compliments on this swim suit!!!<br /><br />Size pictured is a Xlarge."
2.0,The band is way too short. And I have average wrists.
2.0,Not a fan of this model
2.0,Cute but the material feels like hard plastic. And the chain is 16” for some reason I thought it was longer. pretty disappointed.
2.0,Its ok. Quality is so so.
2.0,Its smaller than stated size and shorter than it appears in the pictures.  Its going back.
2.0,"Really liked this shirt. However, I have a large chest. Did not fit me in a flattering way!"
2.0,Not as secure as they should be.  Keep roll upside down and undone after less than a week.
2.0,"This watch is stunning however the battery died less than two months after purchased after wearing it a handful of times. Now I have to pay a jeweler to put in a new battery, obviously not what I expected to do with a brand new watch."
2.0,"it is made very cheaply and after a couple time wearing it, it's already tarnished."
2.0,This is a very pretty cover-up but to short for my taste. It fit more like a cardigan.
2.0,"Based on other reviews I ordered a size medium in the black with stripe.  I have a 30"" waist and the waistband dug deeply into my stomach/sides and I ended up ruining them trying to cut out the industrial strength elastic band they sewed in.  It is a nice thick fabric and well made otherwise."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:27054773f8791e21fdcf9cb3b3b299cf]] I wear a 2x exactly can sometimes fit 1x but this was too small I’m going to try and order a 3 x now but I’m alittle worried because from what I hear they linen shrinks or gets bigger depending on the was and apparently they need to be hand washed aswell beautiful product tho I didn’t like how the hoodie is to small as well
2.0,"Clicker was bent, sat crooked on my septum"
2.0,"Ordered these to screen print for a customer and she said they're waaaay smaller than a normal 7/8. I felt badly so I ordered other shirts in my own dime and had to remake, definitely lost a lot of money and time with the purchase. There were lots of threads I had to cut too.... size way down!"
2.0,The plastic around the nose bridge was uneven and warped.
2.0,Returned the item. A large is more like a medium for me personally. I am not a big guy but it would seem that size inflation has set in.........i think mayba an XL would have fit better but i went by their size charts. When i am workingout or otherwise engaging in sporting activities don't like to feel like my shirt is binding me. Otherwise a nice shirt.
2.0,Doesn’t fit like a regular hat it feels cheap it looks really good but I would not buy it again and I wear hats everyday
2.0,Returned. Was wayyy to short.
2.0,"Advertised as waterproof, which they are not. My shoes still got wet. I purchased the waterproof rain shoes for cycling.  The biggest problem with the bottom of the covers are very slippery on my pedals. My feet slipped off at least a dozen times."
2.0,I didn't like the material or the stitching that you could not see in the photos. It seemed cheaply made. I returned the shirt.
2.0,"Extremely Small. I ordered a medium, the bottoms were like an XS and the top was a Small. I had to return the whole thing, but I loved the top!"
2.0,Material is too thin and clingy.
2.0,"I was excited to try this swimsuit as a very similar style was a great fit on me.  This one however looked way more frumpy.  There is a lot of fabric around the middle and it made me look heavier than I am.  I found the size to be accurate on both top and bottom.  It fit well, it just wasn't flattering."
2.0,"The sandal looks great and had wonderful reviews.  I purchased a pair and before I could try them on, I was injured.  By the time I could walk again, I realized that they were at least a size too big and my return window had closed.  Please make sure you try your sandals on promptly when they arrive."
2.0,The necklace came broken
2.0,"Writing on the front of the wallet makes no sense. Says ""Forever Friends Your Choice""."
2.0,"No where in the description does it say a size. It says Small on the package. These are kids gloves. I have smallish hands, and I can’t even bend my fingers in these 😟"
2.0,Too small. Didn’t like the fact it felt like snake skin.
2.0,Hard to stay on head. It slips off easily and they're not very pretty. They're see thru and flimsy and make a weak knot.
2.0,These stockings are ribbed and too warm for summer wear
2.0,The soles are so stiff and slippery.
2.0,Fabric is subpar
2.0,Shoulder straps too short made the bra part to high
2.0,Poor quality. Looked nice in photo. Came all crumpled.
2.0,"Blazer looks super flattering in photos, not so much when on. Not great material and tight through the shoulders. When processing for return, the seller would only refund half the price of the item. So now I am out $12.50 & have a jacket kinda fits, but not great."
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture and the fabric looked totally different also. I returned it.
2.0,The heart is a weird shape and it looks cheap.
2.0,Cute and stylish . But sooo tight .gave me terrible headache.
2.0,It’s a little smaller than it said it would be. One of the buttons came off the first time I wore it. It wrinkles really bad. It’s not one of those shirts you can just put on after you take it out of the dryer.
2.0,Not very comfortable when your on your feet all day.
2.0,This dress does is not tapered at the waist at all I got a med my normal size and the fit is like a loose shirt dress.. too large. I can make it work but nothing like the pic.
2.0,"Cute from the picture but when I received i don’t think the print matches the picture, colors were off and not attractive."
2.0,"I just dont have hips like in the photo, therefore it gave me massive cameltoe"
2.0,I didn't like the material.  They were very thin and too long for me.
2.0,The navy is WAY more purple. It's definitely not a navy color whatsoever. The material is very thin as well. But it's cute for the price. Color is just false advertising.
2.0,I liked these glasses although the handle broke a week later
2.0,"listing said it was new, came in a nice little baggie. looks new until I took it out of the package...scratches all over and overpriced too! disappointed."
2.0,It's so small. I have a small wrist too but it's more appropriate for kids or ladies wrists.
2.0,We got the wrong stroller not the same colour we paid for.
2.0,It fits and could be really nice but how they did the pockets makes the skirt lay funny. It looks great when your hands are in the pockets but when you take your hands out it doesn’t hang right and bunches funny
2.0,La corea es muy grande.lo David I.no me gusto.
2.0,"This suit is so cute and it fits SO cute BUT she'll never be able to wear it.  Even when the suit is dry, the top it almost see through making the nipples noticeable.  Then wet it's just inappropriate.  It doesn't come with any way to pad it or make it less transparent so even though it's such a cute design, she can't wear it."
2.0,Pretty pattern but strange fit. Top is large and awkward cut. I ended up not wearing it!
2.0,These are adorable but they run way too small!!!!!  My son just turned 3 and he got a 4T for his birthday.  They barely fit.  With one washing they will be too small.  We are going to try to exchange them for a bigger size.
2.0,Love the style. Poor quality.  Washed them once and the threads came out. Had to resew them.  Bought several colors. Happened with most of them.
2.0,"Arrived, no tool to attach them with, so....Am returning them to get something different!!!  Took 15 minutes and alot of patience to just get one attached to show!!"
2.0,"Awkward and bigger fitting on my body type. I’m 5’2” , I think this would work better for someone taller"
2.0,"I love the idea of this top, but will need to make many changes to it. The fit is so so so short. Unless I have my pants super high this does not cover my mid drift. I will have to wear a shirt under or add material to the bottom. If you have a very short body, go for it. If you have an average body length, I would not recommend this shirt for its price. I do however love the idea."
2.0,They look good but not true size. I always get 2xl leggings but these fit like a large. They looked really small when I opened the package. I couldn't even pull them all the way up. Maybe they put the wrong tag in the pants. They would've been perfect it was a true size.
2.0,"I dislike the way they bow out when wearing, and are slightly uncomfortable... and the gold detail only goes halfway around. Not very pretty to see it that way. The red color is not as bright as pictured either.  Not want I wanted based on the description. Just okay."
2.0,I wear a size 9... the size 8/9 was too small... I should of listened to the other reviews😕So I guess an 8/9 really means 8 1/2
2.0,The tie is too thick tie-knot turns out very big. Also the one I got was badly wrinkled
2.0,"The material is see-through and you can totally see the bra pads that are sewn into the bralette. It looks so tacky, unless you just wear it as an undergarment. The material is nice though: soft, silky and stretchy. I’m normally a size  XS, 32c bra and I ordered a Sm which fir perfectly, so I would say it runs small. Returning because I wanted to wear it as a top."
2.0,Different material than I was expecting. It’s very clingy & shows every little spot through the material that id rather not show. Size is true to fit for the most part. Just doesn’t lay smoothly. Will be returning unfortunately.
2.0,I bought this bracelet in August 2018 and the black color of the semi colon completely came off.
2.0,Nothing special. Makes me wish my boobs were bigger.
2.0,"its a good fitting lens, but the color is  lighter in shade than I expected it to be. To put in simple words, when I look into the mirror wearing these lens, I can see my eyes clearly through the lens."
2.0,"Ordered the regular pretty yellow but the one I received was like a darker mustard yellow, not what I was wanting"
2.0,"These bands, do not last long, they get dirty easily and you cannot clean."
2.0,"The necklace was not as pretty as it looked in the picture. The koala's face was a little distorted. Also, the quality was cheap. Bought it as a gift, and I do not think it was worth what I paid for it."
2.0,I would order 2 sizes up with these pants
2.0,Very tight on my 12 year old. I can't imagine a grown man trying to wear these.
2.0,"The silver gray runs small :( I have black, navy blue, royal blue and they all fit fine. Just the silver gray is too tight. Super disappointed because the color is great."
2.0,"Very streatchy, not compression like at all."
2.0,This did NOT work for me. The elephant pattern made me feel like an elephant in it. It was way too long for a petite person. To alter the length you would have to virtually remake the skirt by cutting down the ruffle all the way around the wrapped width. Fabric felt cheap. I sent it back.
2.0,It looks cheap and not as in the picture
2.0,I’m 5’8” and 140 lbs. I ordered a size m but it was waaay too big. I ended up giving this way to a friend.
2.0,Not a dress for full figure/ big chested women. Makes chest look huge and butt look like a big box. Don't buy if full figured.
2.0,"Looks like a black garbage bag, flimsy and has a strong fishy odor"
2.0,"I am 5,6” 180lbs and ordered an XL in blue. The fabric is scratchy around the shoulders but otherwise comfortable. The blue disappointed me, I was expected a nice midnight blue like the picture but it is a bright neon almost blue against a dark background. It fit well except was right on the shoulders. The slit is high but could be pinned close to the knee to make it more modest. Returning because of the color and shoulders"
2.0,"I would not recommend, but if you order, order a size up; I got a medium; the fit was tight and the sleeves were way short!"
2.0,"The color was good, they were not high wasted, the pocket in the back is a weird feature. The fabric is really thin so you see the outline of the pocket and you see the outline of the built in underwear. Not my favorite"
2.0,"Does not look as shown in the picture but ok. I only use as my gardening shorts instead of out in public.  They do not look like a skirt it’s wide leg, windbreaker type material shorts that make noise when you walk, side slit open, with legging shorts underneath.<br /> Yet comfy, cool & dry fast. Def recommend for yard work &/or beach& pool use."
2.0,These are not real Citrine.  They are heated amethyst.
2.0,"It's a nice jacket, but way too small. My daughter ordered a Large (she's a size 5), but it's so small that it's more like a X-small that would fit a small 6th grader. Only order this jacket if you are on the small size."
2.0,The quality and assortment  of the plugs are great. However the size seems off it fits more like a 4g than a 2g. For size comparison the pair on the left is from this purchase while the single on the right is from an old pair that I lost the mate to.
2.0,"mine was missing some things but overall the dress isn’t bad, it’s like a pleather type of deal. I’m a skinny guy, I got a large and it fits decent, even the breast area lays kind of flat so if you have a bigger chest then I wouldn’t suggest this"
2.0,"sometimes you get what you pay for...it would be fine to give to a smaller young girl, if lost not out much money."
2.0,No me gusto los colores muy opacos diferentes a la foto
2.0,Looks nice but got water logged with just normal  hand washing. And that is from wearing it infrequently.
2.0,It is very large and very cheap.
2.0,Most of the diamonds fell out in a week!
2.0,The goggles were murky. Bought a pair at a chain store for 2 dollars. They are much better.
2.0,"It's a very beautiful bag, but the handles are not sturdy AT ALL. The very first time I used it, all the metal rings that hold the rope handles popped right off! Seems like a bag this size should have sturdy, sewn-in handles to support it."
2.0,Order a size up. I have this to someone smaller than me and it's too tight for them also.
2.0,You pay for what you get. These shorts were cheaply made and paper thin.
2.0,Only got one
2.0,"This is actually a crop top, the top I received is NOT as pictured. In the picture the midrif (tummy) is Not showing. I am so disappointed."
2.0,Way too big to be knuckle rings and there are no varying sizes. I do not have small fingers and they wouldn't stay on. Cute rings though. Just not good on the sizes.
2.0,"Completely see-through on the shirt part, even with a built-in slip. Namely worthless to me."
2.0,Muy sin forma
2.0,Great fabric. I’m 5’7 and 150lbs. And the sleeves were WAY to sort. I purchased a large.
2.0,"I bought 2 pairs of medium a couple of months ago and decided to order a pair with pockets. I ordered the same size, medium, and they fit like a large. I like the sweatpants and wanted to get another in a different color with pockets but there seems to be a lack of sizing consistency. Very disappointed."
2.0,The card wallet is nice and I have more that enough slots for my cards but the wrong color was delivered.
2.0,"Fits as I would expect and I like the deep v neck.  The shirt is quite thin, mow so than other ck shirts I have.  The cost is crazy also.  Over twenty bucks for a single under shirt.  My mistake though as I thought it was for a two pack (2pac).  The low rating is due to being super thin which may not be a big deal but mostly due to being so pricey and I don't know why."
2.0,Fabric was weird and felt like I was wearing a swimsuit. The fabric was poorly printed so any slight stretch showed the white under the printed.
2.0,Just okay. Mediocre design.
2.0,"These are super cute when you first put them on, but the fabric is incredibly thin and the waist isn't really high. After an hour, I've pulled them up three times. My fitbad snagged the fabric and now they have a hole and you have to wear just the right undies to not have lines. Do not recommend."
2.0,"This is a nice looking summer dress. and yes, it does run small..but the worst of it is that it is NOT 100% Cotton as advertised.  Being a cotton poly blend...it is hot to wear and does not breathe like cotton.  I would not order this again.  Would have been pleased if it was 100% Cotton as advertised."
2.0,"I ordered these to wear for  morning car line duty during the winter.  I was disappointed when I tried them on.  I ordered a 2X so that they would fit over my pants.  I normally wear size 16.  The waist was loose but would not be a problem.  The length however was about 3 inches too long (I am  5' 4"").  I wish they offered these in short, average, and long lengths.  Needless to say, I returned them."
2.0,Thought this was the whole outfit. I should have read that closer. It is only the shirt. Paid to much for this thin shirt.
2.0,"The amount of each letter is no were close to being equal. I ordered 100, did not even get ""C"" and several letters only came with one. but got 10 ""F"" 9 ""D"" 8 ""Q"" & ""X"". I know it was random but I was expecting it to be close to even for each!"
2.0,"ring has separated after only a couple of weeks of wearing.  It's not expensive to begin with, but you get what you pay for..."
2.0,It was cute but much much smaller than expected It's kind of Amazons thing at this point
2.0,"Nice colors!  Sizing is way off much too small also when taken out of the package it has more wrinkles than the back of my feet! Needs an iron before you can wear!  Over priced .  Also some short sleeves, some three quarter lenght."
2.0,The company which sold it sent me a returned watch. I complained and got 10% discount. The watch itself is okay. I purchased it for someone else. I would not pay this much for a Guess watch.
2.0,The product is not true to size at all. My son fit 18-24 month clothing nicely and 2t is a bit big on him. This overall seems to push his diaper up and make it move to the side. The size runs way too small.
2.0,The arms were baggy and longer than I expected. Not sure I liked the fabric either. Pretty color but also darker than what image online shows online. I will return only for these reasons.
2.0,These were a great rise- it stopped right above my belly button BUT the back is cut way too high for my liking ie. if you don't like the bottom of your butt cheeks hanging out then I would find something else. It fit fine but I just wasn't comfortable with how revealing it was so I'll be sending these back. Bummer :(
2.0,Very cute but so awkwardly made..very large around boob area..so large that I was willing to GIVE it to three of my friends and every single person all different body types said it was too large of a scoop in boob area..the idea of this dress is cute but another thing to keep in mind was I had wanted it for vacation and this dress is very heavy because of lace
2.0,The color was not as bright as the one shown in the picture but very comfortable and the pockets are small
2.0,"This purse is super cute (red trim on 3 sides of front and back of bag with red handle and red shoulder strap - see stock photo of the bag I'm talking about attached to this review). However, even though the bottom of the purse is 5&#34; the opening zipper only opens to about 2.5&#34; wide, which makes it impossible to grab a wallet and put it out easily or even without scratching the back of your hand on the zipper.  Not nearly wide enough to open up and look into the bag to find what you need (ie sunglasses, phone, lipstick, pen etc.).  There also is a zippered interior compartment on the opposite side of the interior slip pockets (not mentioned in the description), however with the narrow top opening it is not possible to use this zip interior pocket at all unless you have VERY small hands (even my 11 year old could not reach in easily to the interior zippered pocket).  I was sad this particular style had such a poor design for functionality, because it truly, IMO, is the cutest purse in the line...I LOVED all the extra red!  I ended up with the other purse of a similar size from NAWO - still cute, a bit more golden & black accents; opening still tight/narrow, but I can get my wallet in an out of the one I kept, with much more ease.  Until they fix the top/zippered opening to open wider, I'd personally NOT recommend this bag."
2.0,Very difficult on and off. More so than other brands I’ve had and this was taunted to be easy pull one.
2.0,This runs very small. Very thin t-shirt material. Shrinks a lot.
2.0,"Shoes are super cute... that’s why they got two stars, but they’re just way too small. And I ordered according to the chart and they were still two sizes too small. The shoes also have literally no arch support and my daughter is 16 mnts and walks so they wouldn’t have been much use anyway."
2.0,"This was bought for my husband and it broke the second time he wore it.  It is a nice looking watch, though."
2.0,"Unless you intend to buy these for a toddler, they are way too small."
2.0,"Not sized right, the 24&#34; doesn't fit the size it's meant to. It fits my 20&#34; carry-on."
2.0,I really like the band except for the fact that it keeps falling off!  It is comfortable and cute but not secure.  Have had it fall off over 5 times in less than two days.
2.0,so I bought a pack based off of the size scale. I am a large guy so I bought the XXL and its way to big on me. All the other compression shirts that I own a XXl is just tight enough compress me. These however were like wearing in under shirt. they feel great just wish it did what it was designed to do. if you buy I would go 1 size smaller.
2.0,"They are really long, but kinda tight around the thigh. Mostly gave this 2 stars because the bows fell off as soon as I got them. They are hot glued on"
2.0,Cute item but poorly package to ship came in damaged
2.0,"So disappointed with this dress. I got it because I have a dress very similar to it that I love and is super flattering, but this dress looks so cheap, has very thin material, and is so ill fitting."
2.0,"It wasn't the same socks I ordered, it had the same colors and one Unicorn on it instead on of multiple unicorns. I purchase this socks for a specific reason, the sock I recieved defeat the purpose."
2.0,"a little big , hole in left side pocket . but color is nice."
2.0,The fabric smells like moth balls.
2.0,Size is way off by at least 2 sizes.
2.0,What arrived is a plastic heart.  Not what I ordered.  Cheap and juvenile.  OK for a 13 yr. old.  I am disappointed and surprised because I have usually had very good luck
2.0,I like the design of This Dress...Personal  used
2.0,Fun looking but they were too big for me and very heavy.
2.0,I was very disappointed that these are not true to size I ordered the size i normally wear and they were so snug they were cutting me in the groin area. They were nice and soft and no rough edges around the panty line area. But because they run small I guess these are going to be dust cloths now. If they were more true to size they would have gotten five stars but since I can't wear these with out getting a personal injury they won't work for me.
2.0,I have a black truck. The license plate is not black. It looks purple against the black paint of my truck.
2.0,"I bought this in small being 4'11&#34; and 101 lbs and it was way too tight for me.  I'm returning it; but since it looked very cute and rivaled a $150 almost identical dress at Boston Store, I thought it would be worth it to reorder in a medium to see if that fit looser.  It's quite short.  The small was about 2 inches above my knees, so if the medium will be longer, that's fine since I'm 64 and don't need to flaunt my legs that are stillin good shape by the way.  I ordered it in black and it looked really nice.  But I think that I'll try navy even though other reviewers said it was more purplish in the daylight.<br />I'll revise this review relative to sizing once I get the medium."
2.0,I ordered a size small - as all of the other leather gloves that I own .. but these were so small that they could barely fit my 9 yr old. I really like them but who knows if the large will fit or just be too large!  I'm disappointed 😩
2.0,Didn't know they was all gonna be practically the same.. waste of money. The only good thing is the shipping..
2.0,The shirt has a grammar issue 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
2.0,Viene sin forro
2.0,This was fine except it does not fit on a Pandora bracelet.  It would not fit on any bracelet where the bracelet was round.  The loop at the top is oval.  Too bad because it would have been great.
2.0,"Very beautiful n stylish<br />However, they were a kids fit! Tiny width<br />Unbelievably micro-small<br />????"
2.0,The first time I put it on the metal part broke. I put it back together and wear it . I do like the looks of it and is comfy and stylish.
2.0,"This shirt hardly looks like it does in the picture, not the dark gray as pictured, and it is GINORMOUS. I ordered a small and it could probably fit a large or even an extra large. Not worth the money at all."
2.0,"Cute but smaller that actual size, I ordered a 3t, which should have fit my 2 year old perfect, but it didnt, it fit like a 16-18 month, so ummmm..... No"
2.0,"It's a comfortable shirt, but not nearly as cute as pictured.  Weird fabric."
2.0,it was way too small and I ordered bigger because that is what other reviews said. The padding is also not good it was like having two cups in the bathing suit and looked unnatural
2.0,I plan to give this gown to my daughter who is much smaller than me.  It was too small for me.
2.0,"The  LS&S Talking Watch we received looks nice, but the band is tight. The face also seems small for a man's watch, but we decided to keep it and replace the band. However, the watch suddenly began announcing the time every hour on the hour, even though the button is not being pushed. The voice is loud enough in quiet places that it's disturbing. It has done this for four days now. We're returning the watch and will look for another."
2.0,Poor quality. Broke 4 times already and can't repair the final break...be cautious.
2.0,I really like this backpack but the zipper went bad after the first time usage. Sad to return it!
2.0,Well the mask fits as expected I was expecting a slightly thicker material.  Considering how easily my whiskers penetrate the material I'm not sure how protective this is supposed to be.  But it gets a few point for being pretty.
2.0,"The fabric is listed as cotton/polyester but it’s more of a satin polyester blend with some shine.  I expected a knit fabric but it’s actually a shiny, stretchy, polyester so it looks cheap.  I’m 5’6”, 230lbs  and the XXL was a little big but most importantly about 3 inches too long since it dragged the floor.  Returning this one."
2.0,It said plus sized but I don’t know any plus sized person who would fit in it!  I am not plus sized. I ordered it because it was cute not noticing the description said plus sized. I got it in my normal medium size and I felt like I would rip it getting in. It’s super cute but once it’s on.... you better not take it off unless you are done wearing it. Getting it back on wet would be impossible.
2.0,I am giving the seller a 1 star review for inaccurate description. He info states 100% Cotton and after receiving the product not a single pair of boxers is even close to 100% cotton.
2.0,CRAFTMANSHIP TERRIBLE! A HOLE IN RIGHT SIDE TOE IN 2 DAYS!
2.0,Way too big. The straps are very thin lace. I’m wondering how long they would hold up before they rip.
2.0,"poor quality, I deception this bag"
2.0,I went off of what another review said and got a Large since I’m also a 34DD but the boob area is way small I feel like if I move at all my boobs are going to pop out. The bottoms are big since I’m usually a medium. Not recommended for anyone with a large bust
2.0,"These gloves do not hold up to all wild cat bites. Claws yes- one wild cat clawed very hard and my hands were protected. Another wild cat bit many times, sometimes my hands were protected, but one bite went through the finger section of the glove and my finger was punctured deeply."
2.0,No nose strip<br />Already starting to loose it’s color andd so the material is got fuzzies
2.0,"Flimsy material, way too big. Falls off of me."
2.0,"Wow, so ordered an xl for my S. O. & it literally was almost the same size as the medium I ordered for my self. We ordered us and our toddler a shirt. The toddler shirt was accurate size but the adult are way small for the size it says. They will shrink even more bc they are cotton too. He's 6'1 and about 230 it does not fit, it's WAY SMALL for an XL. I'm 5'6 135 and the adult medium fit me perfect. My son is 2 and fits the 4T. They are cute shirts. Just sizing way off. Be careful ordering."
2.0,Sizing is off. Choose your normal size.
2.0,they are not polarized. Should have tested them immediately when I got them but held it off till I had to actually wear them weeks later. false advertising. case is good though
2.0,Charger piece took a chunk of meat out of my son's ankle. LED lights only work a few times.
2.0,It lost a micro screw within 2-3 days of wear so one strap was hanging by a single corner attached to my watch.
2.0,"This shirt is super cute, but is very short. It is not as long as pictured. It was also much tighter than pictured. Maybe order up a size. For me, if I ordered up a size, it would probably be too wide and awkwardly short, so I am just returning it and will buy something different. I am disappointed because it's such a cute shirt!"
2.0,Does not look as good in person as it fo s on the picture..
2.0,"The wrist band is very hard to clasp shut and once you are able to get it clasped, it has a tendency to come undone.  It would not have been so bad if, when it came undone, it was not so hard to clasp shut again."
2.0,I loved this piece but broke after a couple wears. Super bummed because it’s so rad.
2.0,Quality of jacket is not what the picture shows. It’s thinner and you can see the jacket liner thru the tossels
2.0,"I wanted to love this but the cut was very strange, it seemed poorly made and just wasn’t what I had hoped it would be."
2.0,"the medal piece in the middle, for larger chester ladies, comes undone easily making for a difficult wear"
2.0,I like the design. But it needs to check before sending it out to the customer. Sometimes cheap stuff can be good too.
2.0,...but they did not.  They actually caused more pain on the top of my feet.  I bought directly from the Healing Sole website and returned for a refund before 30 days (minus $8 shipping).  I just can't wear a thong-type flip-flip sandal.
2.0,Lights only worked intermittently.
2.0,"The cuff links are ok, but the monograms are decals and they were peeling off when the cuff links arrived."
2.0,Idea is good but the word adjustable is misleading. It is an elastic headband that is so tight that no one can wear it. Will have to make a few modifications to use.
2.0,"This was way too small. I went by the size chart and ordered a large. The buttons wouldnt even button or get close to buttoning. It was really short too, and I am not tall. The fabric was a rough linen material that was alot thicker than I was thinking. For reference I am 5'2, 150lbs, and wear 34G"
2.0,"The shoes are cute but way to narrow. My son couldnt not even wear them bc it was hurting his foot. I suggest ro go to a sporting good stoe like Dick, the prices are the same."
2.0,"These are so heavy they would add on an extra 1/2 or whole shoe size.  Relatively soft but not as soft as I'd hoped, especially for the money.  These would be great for boots and shoes that are too large for your foot or skating/skiing.  Warm.  Decent quality.  I wish the material were more comfortable, but MUCH better than the non-cotton nylon stuff coming out of China.  This is actually a very cottony feel.  True to US sizing.  For me personally I sent them back as for this kind of money I thought they'd be really soft and they weren't--a little soft, but not soft enough, especially if you have sensitive skin or fibromyalgia."
2.0,Its cute but baggy and doesnt fit to well. I sized it an it still was to big.
2.0,"These are some stylin' shades. Unfortunately, the lenses are so dark that you can barely see through them. Rather than send them back to China, I'm keeping mine for those occasions when looking good is more important than being able to see well."
2.0,Not very study
2.0,Horrible material like on Halloween costumes. Won't be wearing it.
2.0,"They are very small, not worth the money spent"
2.0,"Although I love the soft feel of the leather of this band, I am highly disappointed in the color. The image of the product, and the color of the actual band are completely different. What I received was not what I was looking for."
2.0,bought my size which is XL and got something that fit like a medium.
2.0,They're pretty but you get what you paid for. Most of them the threading is off so the back pieces don't screw on.
2.0,Fits up top but is not very long. Barly coverend to my waist. Did not overlap to my hip pads
2.0,This case might fit a triple combination but it definitely does not fit both a BOM and a Bible. Had to return.
2.0,Seams started ripping within a few months.
2.0,"These are meant to be pretty cheap, but even as such, the lenses don't secure very well and a rattle. Also only one lens (the black one) is polarized. For the money, which isn't much, you could probably find better. However the case is actually pretty sturdy and nice.<br /><br />Regarding the fit, I have a smaller head, but the width is quite wide for me and looks pretty silly."
2.0,The material of this dress is the same as a cheap halloween costume. The inside of one of the pockets was not sewn. One wash and it will be a crinkled mess. Going back. Like something you'd get from Wish.
2.0,"Sized down on this since it was a loose fitting top. Loved the color, shape & fit of it. Unfortunately, I had to return mine.. there was a hole in seam on the arm that was missed during the stitching process:("
2.0,"The seller either mislabeled this or is colorblind: the color isn't oyster, it's khaki."
2.0,material was not as expected too small
2.0,"I loved this and thought it was super cute. However, I didn't even get to wear it. Took it out of the package and there was already a huge hole in the arm seam. Guess I should have looked at previous reviews, looks like this is pretty common. Will be returning this!"
2.0,"Bought the same sizes my girls normally wear. Got a size 10-10.5 for my 4 year old and those are big but she can still wear them.  Got a size 12-12.5 for my 5 year old as this is her usual size. However, the clogs I received are huge and even though they say size 190/MM which is equivalent to 12-12.5 toddler, they are way too big. I wear size 5 ladies and these clogs fit me, just to give some perspective.  They aren’t sturdy or as cute as pictured. They look cheaply made and like something that won’t last long. Based on the price though, it’s fair to say I got what I paid for. My suggestion, if you can stretch a few extra bucks, buy the actual crocs brand instead."
2.0,"I sent it back because it is somewhat small, and I am going to order another size."
2.0,These break easily and won't last for very long.  I ordered two for my front visors to keep my driving glasses and a pair of sunglasses on them.  They  quickly lost their integrity to grip and hold onto the visor.  One kept falling off when I was driving and the other ended up breaking in two.  Don't recommend.
2.0,"Would have given a five. Liked the material, color and design, but alas it was to small for me."
2.0,It does not drop off the shoulder at all.
2.0,A bit cheapy ... zippers doesn't glide smoothly and feels like it will break adding to much force. Love the actual design but can't have much fun with it.
2.0,Too small ....I bought it XXL but it looks like a Large
2.0,The shirt looks cute but... the bottoms to it are way to long. Even in high waisted pants it shows. I’m not sure if the one I got has a defect but I wouldn’t buy it again....
2.0,Stitching started to come undone almost immediately. Returned.
2.0,Way to big wouldn't fit my ear returned the item
2.0,"upon arrival I opened the package and was very excited! they are the perfect size and gauge, however once I tried to open the gold colored one, the nub that allows it to close broke off immediately. they are also extremely difficult to open, while they are in your nose and even when they are not in."
2.0,"The strap on it broke within 6 weeks of purchase.  Everything else held up great. I was disappointed to find out that there is no compartment on the bottom, it's just a faux zipper. I can still use the purse with the handles, although inconvenient."
2.0,They look fantastic but I couldn’t wear them because they were already breaking when they arrived. They’re super fragile.
2.0,"Really cute swim top, but much smaller than expected...usually a 14 fits me on the top, but with larger hips (and the other warnings of running small), I went with a 16...and even after taking out the removable bra inserts, the girls a squished in there.  Sending this one back!"
2.0,"This dress is very short.  I bought for my 10 year old daughter is about 5,4&#34;.  Had to send it back."
2.0,The arm part is weird other than that I liked the color. It's form fitting
2.0,I thought these were the bags you could unfold and pull products from. They are cute and durable but not the same bags advertised on IG and FB.
2.0,"Wayyyy too thin to wear to work and the purple is faded and looks nothing like the picture in the description. If you just want a cotton summer dress, it may work. I will be returning it."
2.0,"I was initially happy with these but one of the zippers broke while putting them on for the 4th time. They are a tight fit for size 9.5-ish (43) sneaker-style mountain shoe- a good thing once on, but not so good/ when trying get on and off.  Stretch presumably is what pulled the zipper off the teeth. They did keep my feet warm at 15F temperatures"
2.0,It looked really nice out of the package.  Unfortunately it came apart at the clasp in a matter of hours.  Very disappointing!!!
2.0,"My daughter wore once and strap broke;  Cute idea, but cheap."
2.0,Fabric was very thin & color didn't really appear as advertised.
2.0,"I like the style, a little different than just a plain vest. The good and drawstring details are nice. The hardware looks to be quality. I would prefer zippers on the pockets though. The packability is good, which makes it easy to use for layering without added bulk.<br />I was aware the sizing was a slight gamble considering the conversion indicated in the item details. So ordering a Medium was supposed to be like ordering a Small. I typically wear a Small or Extra Small. This vest was so big that I would label it a Large. The length is long, the armholes are bigger than necessary, and the width was too wide, even with the drawstring. I returned the vest."
2.0,"Didn’t like the fit, too small also and fabric looks like it snag easily. I’m going to donate them and buy something better."
2.0,"I received these jeans today...I am 5'7&#34; and 131 lbs.  These jeans are just ok.. I ordered a Tall 8 as they were out of the Medium. I had to roll up 2 inches off the hem.  I think they are more for curvy women.. I would not recommend for women who just want a pair of comfy jeans.. I have them on for the day..they &#34;bag out quick&#34;. They are pretty high waisted to. I think they are great for curvy women, but not a good pair of jeans for 39.99. They do not enhance your butt at all. My advice..keep the tags on.. I will wait and see how they work during the day. But so far, these jeans look nothing like the photo :( Not a good buy for 40 bucks."
2.0,"I had to send this back.  It arrived with pieces falling off and was not the best quality.  It is very pretty, though, and might be just right for someone who is talented about putting stuff together."
2.0,Two stars bc the design is cute...other that that stuff scratchy material and way too small. Not true to size. Also the collar is small and weird And curls up after being washed.
2.0,"This shirt was just big from the neck, wide that it would show shoulders lol, but overall my son loved it and wore it to Hollywood Studios."
2.0,This thing was TINY. I expected it to be tight but I couldn’t even zip the thing. I usually wear a small but I ordered a medium based on other reviews and I still couldn’t zip it. Order like 2 sizes up.
2.0,The photo clearly shows a metal chain but mine came with a black plastic or leather braided chain. I could have returned it but I had no time to buy another gift. False advertising.
2.0,Got green ears and earrings came bent so the coating is all messed up
2.0,Pockets ruined this for me as I'm pretty hippie.
2.0,"Love the appearance of the straps, but they aren't adjustable.  This suit does not provide enough support for 34Cs."
2.0,"Nice , loose & flowy top. Comfortable and it goes with a wide selection of bottoms:  slacks, jeans, tights, and casual skirts."
2.0,"I should have known better.  It's made in China so it's WAY smaller than the description says it is.  Even the sizing chart is wrong.  I'm 5'10"", 200lbs, with a 54/54"" chest.  I usually wear an XL for most shirts and even that's a little baggy (I like that).  So...I ordered the XXL for this, thinking the size up would be a smart thing.  That was the largest offered.  NOPE.  The XXL is barely a medium-to-large in standard American sizes.  I can't even get it on.<br /><br />If you can get the size right, this is a really nice shirt - very smooth linen, and well made.  Giving it to my much smaller son.<br /><br />Disappointing"
2.0,"Husband is a size XL always In shirts and while this shirt is a. k and it’s wide enough but is really short like if he puts his arms up over his head the shirt goes up to his belly button and it rests right at his belt like with his arms down. Which means this shirt will give you plumbers crack. Lol<br />My husband it’s the super fit but not too big either. The shirt is either contoured more for a body builder or a girl we can’t tell lol.<br />The shirt print is also low quality unfortunately it’s like a very cheap heat transfer iron on rather then a screen printing or inked image, colors were also washed out and not very vibrant. Also the print was small compared to the rest of the shirt only filled up about a 4th of the front of the shirt.<br />Overall not impressed.<br /><br />I do not recommend this shirt."
2.0,The sleeves were not cut properly and the fabric was very cheap feeling. It didn’t look anything like the photo shown.
2.0,Much too small & any hair or fuzz within a mile sticks to the material.
2.0,"The decorative &#34;stone&#34; is a piece of plastic, no more.  The metal is unidentifiable.  The peices are over sized, awkward, mismatched.<br />This is costume jewelry, no better."
2.0,I ordered medium since I normally wear 8/10 women's. The pattern and color were just as expected but I prefer my dresses to reach my ankles. I'm 5'6'' and the dress fell a couple of inches above my ankles.
2.0,Way too small! I ordered a medium which usually always fits me in every pair of leggings. Not even close to fitting. I even gave them to my sister in law  to try who is about 30 pounds lighter than me and they were too small for her too. I recommend going up at least 2 sizes as they have no stretch either. Will NOT purchase again and do NOT recommend.
2.0,"Photos miss showing the main seam on the cap, it is huge. About 3/4 runs inside the cap, not clean on the outside. The bottom of the seam is outside and about 3/8"" high. Various terminations of knitting show puffs of the yarn and knots on the outside of the cap.<br />In short, cheap stuff. Can keep the head warn."
2.0,Didn't love the look of the stitching. Felt like painted leather would peel off easily.
2.0,"DON'T USE THIS ON WHITE SHOES! My cream yeezys turned to yellow cream becase of this cleaner. Stick to other brands when it comes to white shoes. It got the dirt off of them but left yellow stains, the stains fortunately came out with water but it takes a bit of scrubbing. Another thing to note is the brush is cheap and the paint begins to chip a lot which can ultimately damage your shoes. Save yourself a trainwreck and buy Reshoeven8r or Jason Mark."
2.0,I purchased the ivory and is definitely more beige and not like the picture.
2.0,The pants look like nurses scrub pants that are too short.  Not flattering and very thin
2.0,So disappointed on this one. As soon as I opened the package it smelled like chemicals. I was afraid to try it on. Once I got passed the smell I could not get the shorts pass my thighs. Truly mislabeled.
2.0,I'm only 5 foot these pants looked so comfy but when I tried them on I'm walking on the pants. So had to return them. Super cute just not made for short people like me. I'm bummed out now cause I was really looking forward to wearing these pants too. :(
2.0,Comes off too quickly.
2.0,"Too big, had to return it!"
2.0,The material is more of a polyester mix and not a T-shirt material. I have smaller hips and a large butt and it made it a lot shorter in the back.
2.0,Really disappointed. I have only worn these a few times but the surface on the lenses is all scratched.
2.0,No stitching on the sides and the back.  Very poorly made and expensive for the quality.
2.0,"Cute but flimsy, one broke after a week of wear."
2.0,Distorts view and does not make a proper seal allowing water to come in.
2.0,Once the stickiness goes away. How do you replace the stickiness? And you can’t wash these.
2.0,"These boots have maufacturing flaws and will be returning. Wonder if Zappos is passing off seconds, Will contact Chippewa directly."
2.0,The wraps were done like a cheap item that wasn’t sewed on the ends. They were cut like kids in second grade. I paid a higher price that was actually worth $1.00. Will not get that again although the colors were pretty good
2.0,Only used a few times and now there's a loud humming in the left ear piece. Disappointing!
2.0,Material was ok. But size was ridiculously small. I ordered a medium and it had to be at least a X Small if not a size 14 in kids.
2.0,"It was not as I expected, faded Looking no shine."
2.0,"The belt was comfortable and easy to use.  It was purchased June 2018, buckle fell off of the belt Sept. 2018.<br />Very disappointed."
2.0,"Sizing is WAY off with this! I ordered a L,3t. This is not a 3t! My kid who wears all 3t stuff is swimming in it. It looks more like a 5t! I guess he’ll grow into it, but it’s really not able to be worn other than around the house which is sad, cause it’s his fave show. :("
2.0,"It tends to slip off at night, cute pattern but not very comfortable, had to end up using my previous durag instead."
2.0,The led lights on the black skirt are red blue yellow green not purple blue green like in the pic. They do not match the shirts I got to go with them.
2.0,"This cropped black velvet top was okay. I think the description should have mentioned it runs small. I ordered a large and it fits like a 12 year old girls dance top. Lol. I say dance top because the material is stretchy and thin. I have a large bust so this top doesn’t fit all that great but it’s not awful. Based on this fitting, I should have ordered a size 2xl if that were an option."
2.0,Material is very thin and not forgiving. Runs small. I sent it back.
2.0,"The shirt is super cute. I love the cutout details at the shoulder. It fit me really nicely for the most part. However, it is way too short. Barely came to my beltline. For reference, I got a size L. I am 160lbs, 5'7&#34; and wear a 38D. I had to return it because I knew as soon as it was washed it would be unwearable due to being too short."
2.0,"I loved this design. However when I got it, it was too small."
2.0,"My purchase arrived quickly & nicely packaged, however, I was very disappointed in the quality. I was unable to use half of the keychains because it was a safety issue for my students. Several rocks had sharp mounds of glue where the chains were glued on. I cut my finger on one of the rocks and after checking the rest, I found several more with the same issue. Otherwise the rocks were fine but considering my purchase of 50 rocks at $1 each only had 20 I could use, I'm disappointed I purchased them."
2.0,When I opened my purchase it was missing a pair of the earrings :(
2.0,"Kind of lost its shape after a few uses and is just too small to fit well. Not really a proper flat brim snapback in my opinion, the bill is too small for one..."
2.0,"These are compression socks, but why ruin the cute zebra print? It has special meaning for a medical zebra like me (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.) I wanted to give awareness to the disease and look cute while taking care of my health issues. Turns out I'll just be doing the last with this, wearing them under pants. The description was not clear about these ""designs."" They aren't shown anywhere in the product photos. I'm glad they didn't cost much as far as compression socks go. Just disappointed."
2.0,I hand washed this before wearing and the outer pocket flap seams (2) frayed and pulled away in places from vest. Can only imagine the results if I had machine washed it.
2.0,I bought the navy and pink striped socks and the are not actually thigh high.
2.0,My wife loves this rash guard but I’ve to give 2 Stars as she is an aqua aerobics instructor and her arms/shoulders got burnt even though it states 50 UVF protection. Her class is 1hr long.
2.0,The material is very cheap it's thick and itchy ! It's very cute though! I had to return it because I did not like the feel of the material!
2.0,Dress doesn’t look like the picture. Very cheap material
2.0,These are cute and all but when I went to clean them off with Lysol it left scuff marks and mess the them up bad I only wore them once just got  them
2.0,I was pleased with how they felt however they are not lasting very well. I have holes and rips in less than 3 months and I have socks years old that are in better shape.
2.0,"Cute cup, small... DO NOT put in dishwasher! It peeled off and is now ruined"
2.0,The flip-flop was very hard on the feet and the soul was not flexible making it very uncomfortable especially between the toes. Overall very unhappy with this purchase.
2.0,I looked like I was joking...Too large and shapeless. Had to return.
2.0,Present never heard if good or bad.
2.0,Shipping was fast but my pink one has a lot of discoloration for some reason already and I've not even worn any of them. Small and cute but should not arrive already tarnished
2.0,"Watch did not work properly from arrival. Displayed funky non-numeric symbols instead of numbers and letters.<br />I liked the overall look and features, but if it doesn't work, then it's not really useful..."
2.0,"Poor quality, feels nothing like the ones I have purchased before. Looks fake."
2.0,"The material of these Yoga pants was more similar to a wind pant...although lightweight they swished when you move...and not really stretchy. They fit ok and I appreciated the availability of petite length. But I knew I would not wear them so returned them same day,"
2.0,two pairs were broken and the clasps didnt close. ended up throwing them out.
2.0,"//[too fLimsy,,,two pairs ripped after initiaL washing using powdered detergent and warm water,,,one pair ripped totaLLy on the side whiLe attemptig to put on hand in church this morning,,,LuckiLy brought severaL others with me,,,had to refrain from harsh words,,,otherwise,,,soft and comfortabLe despite tears and rippage,,,there is a previous suppLier and probabLy numerous other with a more durabLe cLoth,,,];"
2.0,They are like an xxs
2.0,I was so disappointed to return this. Ran quite small. Could barely get it on even though I sized up.
2.0,Highly Disappointed
2.0,The post are much shorted than normal post. Ok quality...just the length is not right.
2.0,"I guess I really can't complain given how inexpensive these earrings are. Unfortunately the posts and the clasps are not angled to fit against each other appropriately. some of the pairs the offset is noticeably crooked, while on others it's just inconvenient. This does create an occasional pinching but doesn't make it completely impossible to wear. I would recommend looking elsewhere for better made earrings."
2.0,It way to small
2.0,"Love length and fit. Nice soft fabric. Comes out of dryer wrinkled badly. I pull out of the dryer early, hang and hand press immediately but the wrinkles look bad."
2.0,It's cute but does not fit like the picture too small the cups
2.0,"This was the second order of these socks and they are not the same as the first order. These are not as soft as the first and are more bulky than the first, hence the not so good review."
2.0,Would probably like but WAY TOO SMALL
2.0,"The stitching is cheap and the buttons on mine are completely not aligned. I've been able to wear this once, then immediately noticed how asymmetrical and poorly constructed this skirt was. I give it two starts because the actual skirt itself has a material that is easy to steam and pleat, but the waist is an absolutely mess. I regret this purchase."
2.0,Well the first thing I noticed about this watch was that it's smaller than I thought and even though it has many adjustment on the strap I didn't like the way it fits
2.0,Wanted to like but support up top isn’t good for anyone who’s DD. Or DDD. Great pattern. Fits a little bigger than the sizing chart said.
2.0,These masks are NOT breathable. They are actually worse than others I already have. I don’t like false advertising
2.0,This piece would have been lovely if packaged better. The feather was so bent and damaged there was no way to straighten it. I tried several ways so I could not even wear it. If this was not an issue it's a really pretty necklace.
2.0,Expected better quality and they fit loose
2.0,so big i could have gotten them twice
2.0,Material and quality were less than my expectation. Poorly sewn and cheap in texture.
2.0,The seller’s measuring chart is misleading. I provided pictures of my size 40 tactical pants to compare with the seller’s brand. I would like to give the seller the benefit of the doubt  and get an exchange or full refund.
2.0,I ordered a small but it was much bigger likely a large. Made from acrylic so it wasn’t going to shrink. The heart was made from a cute cable knit yet the rest was a thin knit. I returned it.
2.0,This does not fit anyway like the photo shows it it looks like a mumu it’s ugly and it’s not comfortable and I’m really disappointed in it
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this, but I had to send it back. The shorts fit well, and the top seemed like (maybe) the middle was sized up from a small original pattern, but the cups were definitely NOT."
2.0,Wife said uncomfortable and and too small.
2.0,"will have to order the larger size, i ordered 2 pair, one pair still in transit, so im crossing my fingers that it maybe bigger. i never return items..due to shipping & hassles..just donate to friends so i am sure i will find someone smaller that will love them. the germanium is very comforting"
2.0,Can not wear.
2.0,"I bought this wig to help with the overall integrity of the silk spectre costume.  Unfortunately, it was awkwardly so the bangs went in different directions and the hair became tangled quite easily."
2.0,"Swim suit looked like the picture, well made, I normally wear a small in all my clothing, but I did put on some weight recently from 115 to 123. The swimsuit fit my 12 year old daughter perfect. I was able to squeeze into the top. I'm 5&#34;6 and my daughter is 5&#34;2.  Not sure of her current weight, but she is about 100 pounds. Order a size up, rated it low because the small didn't fit me and there is no stretch. I'm not able to return because of where I live."
2.0,"I ordered these because the item name listed them as ""Long"" tanks. They are actually shorter than most of my workout tanks. Keeping them only because it's a pain to return things - but if you are a taller person these will be crop tops on you."
2.0,Top too small compared to pants.  Returning.
2.0,I ordered a size small but it was still too large.  I don't know how they measure their hats but it is not a small. When a small hits the bottom of my nose then it is too big.  They need to look at their sizing again.
2.0,Runs very small in chest area
2.0,The sheet looked tacky to me and the underneath slip was too short. Overall not for me.
2.0,"Purchased 2 pairs, after 4 months of light use noticed the material pulling on the bottom front of each leg on both pairs, apparently chafing from contact with the leg in it's pedaling motion.  Identical issue on 2 different pairs. Contacted Fox, no satisfactory resolution yet."
2.0,One of the hats was broken and did not light up.
2.0,I like the shirt but it's so small compared to a comparable shirt in that same size. I wasn't able to wear it for what I had planned.
2.0,these shirts were supposed to be big and tall.they may be tall but not big enuff.sadly disappointed
2.0,"It has a big size to it. It's a cute pack and the handle is nifty. I wish it had more pockets in it so my makeup wasn't just slushing around in it. It also doesn't compress well, so even if you only put a small bit of things in there you still have to pack the whole size of the container. I'd recommend looking for something else, with more organizational capabilities. Despite it's cuteness, I don't think this one is worth it."
2.0,"and didn't have the stretch I expected.. also did look cheap. May work for some as this did get higher reviews.. I also may have gotten one too big, but again it didn't have the cinch I expected."
2.0,"I won't make you see what can't be unseen, so there are no photos. While these seem like nice shorts, they run smaller than any piece of clothing I've ever seen. Upon taking them out of the packaging, they seemed small. I tried them on and they fit like 10 lbs of potatoes in a 5 lb sack. I wear a L in some shorts, XL in others (36-38). I ordered XL to be safe.....and it's more like a Medium or Small."
2.0,"First, these are beautiful and look just like their photo.  I wasn't certain I would like them, but I really do.  BUT the metal is too soft.<br /><br />The prongs on one clasp loosened the second time I wore them. I opened and closed it again, and still didn't hear that reassuring ""click"" sound that tells me they're secure.  I pinched the prongs with my fingers and put it on again but I still wasn't confident it would stay closed.  Later in the evening I touched the earring, and sure enough, it was hanging open.  My pinching them wasn't doing the trick, so my husband pinched the prongs and made them too tight to accept the post.  So I bent it open again using my fingernail, and noticed that we had accidentally bent the earring itself.  Now it was less like a hoop, and more like a paperclip.  I easily pulled it open, but since the post is kind of a curvy one, now the back of the earring (prongs) was the wrong distance from the front (hinge) to accept the post.  After several more adjustments it finally closed.<br /><br />I had been thinking these could become my every day earrings, but now I know that won't happen.  I wonder how long will it be before I break the prongs.  I would return them, but I've thrown out the packaging.  My advice is to pass on these earrings and find others that will serve you better."
2.0,Arrived in a large box not put in mailbox as stated it was running when received it should have a device to stop it until I got it It better not run out fast as I do not know how long it’s been running and received no warranty papers at all no paper work
2.0,My son is 2 and they are still big on him
2.0,"While these are comfortable and very stretchy they are also extremely thin. I wouldn't recommend getting them if you were going to use them outside of your house. They would not be ideal for the gym, yoga, or walking and they do not stay up which is extremely annoying."
2.0,was good for a while but it broke
2.0,"I'm a small person and this necklace was too tight around my neck. Cheap price,. ....cute,. But made cheaply"
2.0,"My daughter hasn't even worn this yet....it's for her birthday party today ...she just put it on and literally half of the stars have fallen off already. It should be okay for the party today, but it's not going to have ay stars left by the end of the day. Just glue spots where the stars once were."
2.0,Partner says its too thick and can't wear it.
2.0,"The item itself was okay but I’m not happy over the fact that it’s listed as 2 pack and the expectation is i receive 2 pieces, instead it’s just a single mask."
2.0,"100% Polyester - if you wear this shirt in the heat you will not be comfortable, very very warm.  It is pretty and looks as pictured but runs a bit small.  I didn't see on the site where it said it was polyester.  Since I had purchased other shirts from this vendor which were NOT 100% polyester, I assumed this one would not be either.  It was such a good price that I did not return it, but I will probably give it away to someone who doesn't mind wearing this fabric.  I can't tolerate the synthetic non-breathable material."
2.0,It looks and fits much nicer on model. Strings really change the look.  Very low at sides showing bra if i arrange strings so top chedt part looks nice.
2.0,"I could not even get these on my child.  The opening for the wrist is disproportionate to the size of the glove and thumb hole.  The wrist opening is so small and the area and length for the fingers is so large in comparison.  There is an adjustable tab; however, it doesn't allow for expansion, just for tightening."
2.0,"Not only was this ridiculously small (I ordered a size L and usually fit somewhere between a S/M at 5'5 and 140 lbs), but the proportions were super weird. The cups sat right above the belly button- you can yank them back up to the chest area, but they just slid back down repeatedly..."
2.0,Its like a t-shirt. Was not impressed with quality vs price. Sent back. Shipper did not pay for me to return. Waste of time and money.
2.0,"The material is so uncomfortable, especially for working out. Very disappointed."
2.0,too small and received without the belt.
2.0,Color of this tie is red not what the picture depicts.  Other than that it's a decent  tie for the price and good for my teenage son to wear for his job at a restaurant.
2.0,"Way too big! Daughter wears a size 8 toddler shoe in Saucony, Native, and See Kai Run Shoes. Bought a 8-8.5 thinking it might be nice to have a little room to grow for this summer but it was 3 inches too long! Knew it was too big when i pulled it out of the package but just for laughs we tried it on her. The only thing i like is the plastic zipper zip lock bag it's placed in for stress free opening. Can't comment on quality when the sizing is too big to even wear"
2.0,Nothing special. Not as cute as the picture.
2.0,"Material too thin, but despite that overall it's a lovely dress."
2.0,The reviews are correct and I should have noticed that before purchasing. the inner part of the band is rough at the edges and irritates the wrist. These genius dumped the packaging so I am stuck with it now.
2.0,"These look great on my son.  But after wearing all at school, the inner seams rubbed between his legs raw.  Too ruff of fabric."
2.0,Material is cchea
2.0,Loved the design and back. Sleeves are not stiched. Front skirt doesnt look flattering and is too long for me. Bust is too tight even though i took one size up the regular based on reviews.
2.0,Came with a stain on it.....
2.0,"The dress is okay, quite thin and runs way too small. Does not fit at all."
2.0,"More of a shirt than sweatshirt, odd fit and material. See through and thin."
2.0,Very strange fit. Too snug in the hips where it should have been loose-ish and an odd too tight fit around the neckline.  Pretty but not flattering.
2.0,stiff and not relaxed as the photo show.
2.0,"The product states DO NOT machine wash, place in the dryer, nor iron.  How am I supposed to eliminate body odor and wrinkles if I use it for exercise.<br />The pockets are too small and too far back."
2.0,This thing fits a little tight and isn’t the most comfortable version. It’s warm but could be a little more breathable. A little bigger would have been clutch.
2.0,It’s basically all covered in the review title. It was very small and broke only after a couple of days.  It was attached to a zipper pull that didn’t get used often.
2.0,Too small but nice
2.0,Nor at all as cute as pic... but my daughter likes to play with them with here dresses outfits
2.0,Runs very small and is very short.  Fits like a straight jacket.
2.0,Had a hard time securing Velcro closures without huge wrinkles and bumps. Also did not comfortably go down as far on my hips as I would have liked.
2.0,Took a very long time to get  priced to high for quality will order from Amazon but not from them ever again
2.0,Be sure to order couple of size bigger.
2.0,"Looked and felt great...right up until I washed it. Faded, shrunk, and feels awkward post wash."
2.0,"Sizing is off. Bought 1 size bigger , tjhe wide is about right, not the length."
2.0,Pretty key chain but it broke after 1 month.
2.0,Disappointed birthday girl who couldn't use the magic dust because the lid is glued on. :(
2.0,I was disappointed when I got these. I thought it was going to be rounded on top but it looks like they just glued a shiney piece of paper to the top. They are still cute and I will still wear them but not what I was expecting/wanting at all. They are very heavy so if your ears are not used to heavy earings they will be sore.
2.0,Product was good but the parts of screw that attach the strap to the watch fell off. We wore it maybe 3x!
2.0,"I ordered the 3 pack of black, brown and gray. I received a red/wine colored pair instead of the brown ones. Will be returning."
2.0,The size runs small. It wouldn't even go over my chest. The print is nice and the color is slightly off. The material feels cheap and there's a strong chemical smell. I would not buy this again.
2.0,Too long. Looks like a dress on.
2.0,"I returned it. To brig, to bright, to much bling for my taste."
2.0,The earrings are too small.  They do not look  like the photo as the painting is not clear.. Not recommended for purchase. I will probably return them.
2.0,like weight nice feel . to narrow for me
2.0,"Cheaply made,, the spandex effect you think your going to get you wont"
2.0,"Fits as expected, but looks cheap. I sent it back"
2.0,"The fabric on these is not soft or comfortable at all so if comfort is a must for you, then skip these pants. They also didn’t look well on me.<br />I am returning them. Not worth the money."
2.0,The dress looked nothing like the photo and the material was cheap.
2.0,"The look is good, but sleeves are way too long. Material is pretty rough. I really don't recommend this product."
2.0,"So when I got the pants, I tried them on, they fit really nice. Very comfortable. But.. These pants are supposed to have 2 pockets.. This particular pair only have 1. The other pocket was installed in the pants on the inside, but there wasn't an opening to actually use the pocket. &.. Another really sucky thing.. There was an hole in the butt part of the pants. If these pants came how they were supposed to be made, they would be perfect. But unfortunately, there was too many noticeable problems. :("
2.0,"Pros:<br />Cheap<br />Cool looking<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very, very poor quality frames, don't even close correctly<br />Lenses smudge very easily<br />Doesn't actually shield your eyes from the sun<br /><br />Bottom line: You get what you pay for. I shouldn't have been so frugal and paid a few bucks more for sunglasses of much better quality."
2.0,Smaller than I expected. I bought this to wear to bed to protect my hair.  If you have alot of hair it will be difficult to cover your entire head.
2.0,"Here are my pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />1) The earrings overall and especially the metal are very light weight.<br />2) It's a pretty blue color<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) the stones are pretty big, making this kind of look like costume jewelry<br />2) The gold clasp is very fragile, almost paper thin.  I think I could easily bend it and break it, or it would break if it got stepped on.  Also it's pretty cheap looking.<br />3) The metal prongs holding onto the stone don't actually fold over, which makes me think the stone might not be secured well<br />4) I don't like the square line on the stone.  You can see them on my picture below<br /><br />Overall I don't think they're worth what I paid for them."
2.0,"This shirt had great potential. However, there were a few things wrong with it. The sizing runs a little small. I ordered a large and should have gotten an extra large. It's a very thin shirt. So, don't expect to wear this as a sweatshirt. The biggest issue I had with this shirt was the red dye. The red dye not only dyed my nude bra red because I got hot and perspired in it just a little while running around hosting a party, but it bled really badly when it was washed. So, the white string on the hood became pink. I washed it a few times and it kept bleeding red dye. Also, the red dye from the shirt on my bra was hard to get out after washing the bra twice with shout and oxi clean.  I still have some red dye on my bra. I ended up throwing this away because of how much the red dye bled in the wash."
2.0,"It’s already falling apart in multiple places and only lasted me one winter. Really disappointed. Otherwise, it’s quite warm and cozy. Looks good."
2.0,"Cute, but the straps don’t close tight enough and the Velcro rips up. The bow is glued on so it was a matter of time before they fell off.  I purchased two pairs for two different children."
2.0,"It's super thin and cheaply made. I did buy larger as the comments said, but it's super short. I am 6'10&#34; and wanted a longer tank. I was looking to be able to print something on a tank, but it is too thin and cheap to be able to do that."
2.0,"I was so disappointed. This one was one of the worst.Add did not state size, and you need a magnifying glass to see the details on this."
2.0,The bra was way smaller than the size. Gaps at the sides of the cup.
2.0,I wanted to love this dress but it is completely shapeless and unflattering. It hangs on your body like a large rectangular potato sack with neck and arm holes.  The fabric doesn’t move nicely.  Epic fail. Sending back.
2.0,"I was disappointed.. I like the buckle, but the belt itself has no locking ratchets for the first 4 inches or so.<br />Not sure why.. another ratchet belt I bought had the locking things within 2 inches of the starting end.<br /><br />Basically it's very easy to cut this too short AND the overlap coming out it at least 5 inches rather than maybe 2-3 most of us prefer"
2.0,"The product didn't create a lather even though I followed the steps. Also, I tried several process of cleaning but the product also didn't create a lather and my shoes was not cleaned throughly."
2.0,Shirt is more orange than pictured.
2.0,"I love the looks of this. Honestly, it seems good quality. There's just the little issue of a missing letter, perhaps its supposed to read, ""TRONGER than you seem"""
2.0,This slipper has no support and no cushioning. Not comfortable at all.
2.0,"It is a Snap Back and I had to Cut off a hole on the Holes end to make it Fit...Other than the Bill I don't like the Cap Material...  It is 65% Polyester and 35% Cotton made by OTTO in China and is not Stiff Enough to hold Shape...  It is NOTHING as compared to the VIET NAM Veteran Cap that I ordered earlier made by ROTHCO also in China but 100% Cotton, has a different way to Size it(the sizing name is common but I can't think of it right now) and maintains its shape very well and I paid LESS Money for it...~!~"
2.0,It's quite thin and the zipper is flimsy.
2.0,"When I first got this and tried it on, it fit fine.  The second I washed it, it shrank like 4 inches and now is too short on me.  I washed it on warm/cold, and the dryer was on perm press.  Everything else I own doesn't shrink with those settings.  This is the only shirt that did.  I'm bummed because it was a cute shirt and I was looking forward to wearing it, but now I can only use it as an undershirt."
2.0,"I want to like these ear studs, but they came broken:( The two layers of petals came apart. They are painted metal and I've tried to glue them together, but still not sure how long it would last before coming apart again.<br />The size - a little bit larger than I expected, and overall, looks much nicer on the picture than in reality."
2.0,This was not how it looks in the picture.
2.0,"Like the old adage, you get what you pay for. I could not give them away."
2.0,"This was way to gaping for the bust area, I love the colors but I would have to wear a tank underneath. Since I live in Arizona I just wanted to wear the dress on our hot summer days, not add anything such as a tank top."
2.0,"I got the black pair. They were cute. However, 30 minutes of casual wear left the tops of my toes very irritated. The back straps were loose. I kept tightening them but my heels were still flopping around. Not a very comfortable shoe."
2.0,"These came folded, like the pics show, in a small envelope. So when I took them out of the plastic wrapping they were folded over at the ends and set that way. I thought I'll try wetting them to straighten them and when they dry they'll be fine. Well, they've dried and are straighter -not completely straight -but they just don't look right; now they look like they're coated with smthg weighing them down, maybe like baby oil, and the fine wispy ends stick together in places. I'm going to try to use them rather then send them back bcz they cost very little but I'm not sure if I will be able to use them. I certainly won't order them again. If the seller simply sent them in an envelope that fit instead of trying to stuff them into a tiny, too small envelope they would've been just fine."
2.0,Immediately after opening the necklace the tip of the stone broke
2.0,They arrived with a small hole in them. I have ordered from this company before & LOVED what I got. This pair in particular seemed to be off in both fit and quality. I do love the colors though.
2.0,It was cheap looking (so in other words it was price worthy) I decided to wear it anyway and it broke in least than a month
2.0,"These socks are similar to compression socks, synthetic that clings to your​ foot 100% but they are like a dress sock with what appear to be reinforced / padded areas. And it's appearance only. I can't imagine these adding any comfort. It's just a visual. An average cotton sock is thicker than the reinforced areas.  I don't hike, I wear work boots. If you want to feel like you are not wearing socks, these are for you but don't expect them to protect your feet."
2.0,Unclips easy and very easy to lose.
2.0,The image does not match the product.
2.0,"I looked like I was drowning in this. The armstraps were super small and squeezed my shoulders but the dress was still gigantic. Honestly I hated the material as well, very scratchy."
2.0,"I bought this as it was the ONLY option for me at 30 weeks to wear to a Cleveland browns game. It is thin, the writing looks like it was ironed on and the shirt is a bad fit. It fit my stomach but it was very baggy and short on the length. NOT worth spending all the money on this product."
2.0,The top of the boot has no ability to tighten around the baby's ankle. These boots fall off my baby's feet within a few minutes. If they had adjustable velcro my rating would be much higher as I like the material they are made of and they are well made. Would send back if I still had the packaging they came in.
2.0,"Item in the color black says 100% cotton in the product description.  The label says 60% cotton, 40% polyester.  It doesn't feel like there is even that much cotton in it.  I am 6'3'' with a 36"" waist.  I ordered size large long (smallest waist size available).  It's more like XXL, super long.  The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because Amazon makes it so easy to return items."
2.0,"Bought a 2x/3x for my dad, who's an XL, and it was too small. Runs at least 2 sizes small."
2.0,This necklace was beautiful out of the package but unfortunately it tarnished within 2 wears. Worth it for a one time wear. This is a product of China!
2.0,"Cool but VERY small, about two sizes."
2.0,"Piss poor quality, is kind of creepy and not funny in person."
2.0,Not that well made.
2.0,Only works for perky breasts..
2.0,Broke first time I wore it. It looks really pretty and was exactly what I needed but I wasn’t able to use it because it broke moments after putting it on.
2.0,Nice size but all the stitching was loose and coming apart after a few days...
2.0,Worked well for the renaissance fair but a bit on the small side and can't really wear it anywhere else like I thought I could.
2.0,"While the shirt looks decent, it came absurdly wrinkled. I had to spend 30 minutes ironing it alone the first time and still didn't take all the wrinkles out. It also wrinkles too easy when you sit and hang it up too. Step up your quality because no one wants to spend forever ironing. Each time I wear this for work,I have to wake up early just to make sure have time to iron this. Really frustrating."
2.0,"Although I ordred a man's large, the shirt must be a woman's large but it doesn't say on the label. The entire shirt was very small but the sleeves were the worst! They barely even reached my biceps. The label says ""L"" and 52, so it may be a Euro Thing."
2.0,Purchased a size XL and it fit like a medium. I can still wear the shirt but not able to move comfortably in it.
2.0,Loved it at first but the stones kept falling out.
2.0,Way smaller and not comfortable at all.
2.0,"I’ve purchased three of these dresses and the beige dress was a huge disappointment.  Not only was the material cheap and different from the Navy and Royal Blue, there was a weird horizontal seem right below the zipper.  The zipper was white and did not match the dress.  REALLY DISAPPOINTED."
2.0,I wish they had a band that snapped in the middle.or that tightens on the inside bc it gets loose and slips up and down the wrist due to it only being one size and extended times of taking it on and off makes it looser and looser. Not ideal and wouldn't buy again or recommend.  I would find a better fit.
2.0,"Welp, now I know why these usually aren't made of cotton. I figured that would be more breathable, but it just doesn't have that fitted quality this kind of thing is supposed to have, so it rides up into just maybe 4&#34; or so of band. Was also super itchy before being washed, consider yourself warned. (I will 'fess up that I didn't buy this to cover a baby belly, just my XL belly that once in a while could use a little extra cover. At least I admit it. ^_~) At least it was a pretty cheap experiment and the stars are cute."
2.0,"First impressions like anything, it was a very cute dress. My daughter loved it! But after washing it ones, the stars on the sleeve almost disappeared. Now I’m stuck with a dress with barely there print...<br /><br />This was clearly a printing problem which they probably knew but neglected to fix.<br /><br />I’m in the fashion industry and I know as a manufacturer it is my job to test that the fabrics are properly printed and would not fade after the initial wash.<br /><br />Very disappointed!"
2.0,Was expecting something a little longer but they run up and hit 3 inches below the knees.
2.0,"These are soooo thin I can see my daughters underwear through the black fabric. They fit well, they're just the crappiest polyester, see through, junk ever. I can't even send her to school in them under her uniform. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they fit well. Waste of money."
2.0,Good price but the quality is disappointing and not as pictured. The resolution or colors of the image is no where near the picture and the clear resin had bubbles in a few of the earrings.
2.0,Very flimsy. One of the three letters were broke
2.0,"These are really cute pants - loved the pattern and style (like regular pants) but they have metal zippers (like big metal zippers) on the pockets and by the boots. Seems like these would get cold/freeze easily, and possible hurt during a fall. They may have run a little big. I bought a size 14 for room (my daughter is a 12), but they were still pretty baggy. I'd say ""relaxed fit."" I returned but mostly because of the metal zippers."
2.0,Not my favorite. It was also a little big and thin material.
2.0,they look nice but the are not well made
2.0,Nice fabric but very small fit. Almost 2-3 sizes smaller than normal.
2.0,The worst thing is to have the distance to the crutch so small and the pants cannot get above the pelvis.<br />Sadly it is a new phenomenon.
2.0,"Much too large for my almost one year old, fit my 7 year old niece on the tightest setting. Also had visible staining on it right out of the packaging."
2.0,Will not change from 24 Hour to AM/PM
2.0,Some came broken and other were to small to be an anklet
2.0,Color is not good—belt is very stiff—not like other bison leather belts I have owned
2.0,It looked very cheap and homemade.
2.0,It was waaaaay to small.<br />Wish all of these tops said truthfully where they are made. Im 5'10 and wear a triple D bra. I ordered in XXL.<br />Gave it to a friend that wears an 8.
2.0,I was expecting different
2.0,"I, like the way it look on, but it popped the first time I wore it :("
2.0,"The only similarities between the picture and what I received was that they're  both white and chiffon.  Other than that there are no similarities.<br /><br />This is basically an oversized white chiffon rectangular scarf. The picture leads one to believe it's a shawl with a &#34;swing look&#34; in the back and oval type neckline that drapes in a manner that can be tied neatly in front.  Not so!  Again it's a basic chiffon white rectangular scarf.<br /><br />They originally didn't me a full refund, rather indicated &#34;here's $3 and keep it because it'll cost you more than that to send it back&#34;<br /><br />After my original review they offered a full refund; therefore, I'm updating my review to include that they did come back and make it right."
2.0,Turned ugly tarnished color after wearing twice
2.0,Cute suit but the heart started falling off after one use.
2.0,"The shirt looks good, but a XXL fits more like a L.  In South Texas we only have two seasons, hot and warm so performance shirts are pretty much a year around option.  The shirt fits like a second skin, and being a big guy I prefer to have a little room in my t-shirts.  All in all, I would recommend ordering at least two sizes over your normal t-shirt size."
2.0,Too big. Ordered Large. This is not a turtle neck item. Too costly to return from overseas. Donated to charity.
2.0,It doesn’t have any stretch
2.0,Runs small and is tight around band area
2.0,Cute watch but only lasted 3 months. The face of the watch got scratched within the first month and the band broke within 3 months. Definitely cheap in price and quality.
2.0,LOL. Bought it for myself but it's Itty bitty; fits my 1 year old just fine.
2.0,"Not so great quality, would make a good Halloween costume, not for the real Oktoberfest"
2.0,I gave these two stars because the quality of material is pretty good. They were too large for me but also just sit off in the waist and abdomen and made me look like I had a beer belly. Not flattering.
2.0,These earrings are cute however they are not leather and have really cheap hooks that are sharp.
2.0,Very stiff and not very comfortable but too lazy to return
2.0,"The necklace itself is the quality O expect for the price, and the recipient likes it. However, it is NOT in the font shown, which was a major deciding factor when buying. It’s shown to be an attractive cursive style, but what I received was a plain and most childish font."
2.0,"This is much smaller than I expected. My guess is Chinese sizes, bc I planned to return and reorder in a larger size, but the shipping was not worth it. I recommend going up a size than what you need. Seems to be made well, just very small."
2.0,I wear a 3x and ordered a 4x so it would be loose but instead it fit like s 2x barely can pull up all the way.
2.0,"The material is weird. Like a swimsuit material, it was shiny."
2.0,Very cheap!!! They smell very weird and you get hot wearing them. They're not real leather. I wouldn't buy them again.
2.0,It looks and feels very cheap.
2.0,"I ordered this based on all of the reviews on Amazon, however what I didn't know, is that this doesn't work great for necklaces, which is what i ordered it for.  I have one necklace that gets frequently tarnished.  It has small charms on it, and because the charms are small, it's impossible to remove the tarnish off of half of the charm.  This might work well for a silver tea set (etc), but it definitely doesn't work for a pendant necklace.  Big disappointment."
2.0,I got the shoes in January for when the weather got better. After three wares in 70-80 degree weather this month the sole and faux leather started to peel off. Not a good pair of wedges...plus the ankle straps are a little big. Junk.
2.0,"I liked the print, the material wasn't bad either but this was still too large. I ordered a small and I usually wear medium, it was still too loose around the abdomen......would work great as a pregnancy dress I guess"
2.0,It turned after 5 days. I threw it away so I don’t have a picture.
2.0,"I like the pattern of the fabric, unfortunately the style of the shorts fell on quality. Can’t tell what is the front or the back."
2.0,Pants are a very thin cheap material. First time wearing them and they have a hole right at the seam. Shirt seems to be made the same way.
2.0,In my opinion I think these look kind of cheap and I thought the photo of the product looks better than the product in person. Ended up giving these to goodwill because someone else might like them just fine.
2.0,Falls apart easily in the wash
2.0,"This set is not for working out, unless you have a gym at home"
2.0,"The fabric did seem cheap when I took it out of the bag. It's nothing stretchy so it doesn't hug which i wasn't expecting to hug my curves but I'm 5'0"", 110lbs, 32D and the small looked oversized and boxy so I returned it."
2.0,The fit around the face is good but because of the location of the straps it constantly slides down. DO NOT GET FOR THE GYM! You will spend the entire time readjusting it.
2.0,This was easy to put together.  The small screw that attaches the handle was missing.  i haven't gone to get a replacement.  Dont know if this works or not.
2.0,"The top does not fit well like it does in the photo for the outfit. It's super super small and doesn't stretch as much as it does in the model's photo. Fabric also folded over itself in the back, not looking flattering."
2.0,It was really nice but the material isn’t the best. It broke the same day but it did it’s job for the day and i wasn’t expecting it last another day anyways. If you need a quick purchase for a quick wedding then it will work but i would not recommend for a whole day and night.  I cut the top off and now my daughter uses it as a skirt so it’s not a total waste.
2.0,Material is too silky. Runs very small. Not as cute as pic.
2.0,Tunics should be loose XXL filts like it's an L
2.0,Size up!!! Not good for wide feet. Beware of the very thin heel! They're not the easiest to walk in.
2.0,I liked the fit.  Very casual.  I liked them until I washed them and the elastic band at the waist twisted inside the material.  Very hard to get it to flatten back out.
2.0,Very boxy like shape
2.0,"The back of the top was not only made differently from what was described it also came tangled up, had to return."
2.0,"I returned this rosary because it looked orange in the listing picture but is actually a dull, brown wood color.........not attractive to me. The beads are also super small and not comfortable to hold."
2.0,Just received item and it was broken on arrival. After looking the glasses over they feel very cheap and wouldn't last one day of wear even if they weren't broken. I would look else where if you are buying for a child who plays sports and need durability.
2.0,"After reading the reviews, I ordered 2 sizes up since everyone’s saying it runs small. I received my jersey and it’s huge! I wear a XL and I ordered a 3X it was just way too big."
2.0,Where is information on how to use. Came in small box with nothing to show how to use item
2.0,Purchased for a pair of white sneakers and after trying to get them white and clean twice there was very little change.  I ended up tossing because I didn't want the jar to take up space in my cabinet.
2.0,I hated the cheap material. I thought it was suppose to be cotton but it was like some polyester material . Cute pattern though
2.0,They are lightweight but poorly made. Material does not hold its shape. Took a long time to arrive so probably international shipment. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Product fit but the colors on the product compared to the image were not even close. I understand shades vary depending on lighting and monitor settings, but I had to return them because I could not work with the colored pattern that arrived. Ordered a light brown pattern/taupe pattern, it arrived black. Easy, smooth return policy. It is unfortunate because they have nice patterns but I do not want to take a gamble on the colors the actual product will be when it arrives."
2.0,Initially a good product. Then the strap broke. I was able to clamp it to the zipper then it broke again. This time the rivet that connects the handle to make a loop broke.  Disappointed.
2.0,Pretty shirt. Looks much better in the photo and it's cheaply made.
2.0,i love the style fit hate fabric will regift
2.0,"These do not come with pockets, as advertised.  That is unfortunately the exact reason I wanted them.  Would be cute and good if I didn’t explicitly want pockets."
2.0,The dog tag and writing was nice and clear. The round keyring attached to it however was bent and disfigured. It was also discolored and didn't correctly match the rest of the keychain.
2.0,The socks run very small. I wear a size 6 and the socks are so tight that I cannot wear them. The knit does not stretch very well. I will need to give these to my 6 year old granddaughter. I think she will love them.
2.0,WAY WAY too small for my ear...maybe better for a smaller ear or as a upper earring.
2.0,product didn't come with mini tool for fixes or adjustments. very disappointed as i cannot fix or adjust as needed.
2.0,"Didn't like it at all, sorry"
2.0,"Nice camisole to wear under low tops.  Fits well, but what I don't like is the material is very shiny and cheap looking."
2.0,Sent back. 5’7” 155 lbs. All 3 dresses I bought were true to size and M perfect ....BUT.... length mid to high thigh. Love the dress and material.  So disappointed.  All 3 went back.
2.0,These were just downright weird. They are a neoprene cuff basically for your foot that has no reason why it should stay on. The hands were strange too. They made you sweat and again nothing to keep them on. I'm no major to go (headstands) but I can do a mean downdog. These didn't for almost any movement. I returned after 2 tries.
2.0,When I received the ring it was exactly what I wanted but 1 of the balls fell off within 24 hours and it is lost. I even made sure they were tight after putting it in.
2.0,"I usually wear a medium, in this top you have to order a size up"
2.0,Somewhat small and cheaply made.
2.0,"there is no way these goggles fit 4-15 years old/ 4 to possibly 8 or 9 if your child is small.<br />I'm so disappointed. I bought these for my grandchildren 8,9 & 12 years old & they are way too small for them."
2.0,"After reading the reviews and following what others said I bought these in the correct size and they kept falling off. No matter how many times I would adjust them, they wouldn't stay on. The material is nice but the grips in the back are not good enough to keep them on. Also after a couple of wears they lost their shape and wouldn't fit right. I don't really recommend. Better off just going to the store to get them."
2.0,Didn't lasts month... Forgot to return it.  Just not made well. Fits Versa 2 perfectly
2.0,"These were extremely large, too large for anyone to wear comfortably in an ear, was disappointed..."
2.0,"The ring is really pretty, but after wearing it for a day my finger has a green ring around it. I'm really bummed."
2.0,The color was more of a red then a maroon
2.0,Flimsy materiel and runs really small
2.0,Material is very cheap and shiny but has great stretch. I'm 5'5&#34; 140lb. Ordered a medium. Fits fine just don't like the fabric.
2.0,This necklace is beautiful but...like the other necklace from same buyer it broke within the hour of wearing it. The jewels are too heavy for the plastic straws that is holding it together.  The first necklace I glued it back together and I did with this one. Too much trouble to return.
2.0,The print all cracked on the aliens head. Only wore once :/
2.0,"Oh my.  If I don't wear a spaghetti strap tank or something underneath this blouse I could get arrested for indecent exposure.  The material is nice and soft and satiny, but the neckline goes down waaaay too far.  The sleeves feel great and I love how they work, but there's some things I would have to change before feeling comfortable wearing it.  It's a shortie so if you have a nice flat belly it will look great - otherwise your muffin top will show."
2.0,"The medal I received was the right size, but for sterling silver it sure is a dull color -- looks more like pewter. I tried to buy this item locally but none was available. And Redding is a city of 90,000."
2.0,Not happy w the quality or got.
2.0,Todo correcto pero sin la “luz incorporada” no sirve para lo que uno quiere usarlo.
2.0,It was a very nice quality but extremely too small.  Great for a weekend but we were going to be gone for a week and had to send it back for a larger one.  VERY SMALL
2.0,"You can immediately tell these are cheaply made. Right out of the box and sit crooked on my face. Also more narrow than advertised and are bigger up and down, so they look really odd. Will not wear these"
2.0,This was the second pair of these I had ordered i ordered one in charcoal in XL and they fit perfectly but the navy is to tight in the waist and is not an XL more like size LG. I'm so sad that the navy didn't fit properly as I would have purchased  more in different  colors but these pants are not consistent in there sizing don't want to chance it.
2.0,"The shirt was cut too small, the 3X fits my daughter like a 1X"
2.0,It doesn't look the same as in person as it does online
2.0,Followed size chart.... wish I would have ordered in a large instead
2.0,Not like the picture. Wore one time and already has pilling on the shirt.
2.0,Fell apart within 5 weeks. The rubber toe separated from the leather. It's such a shame because they are so cute. My son wants me to reorder but I'm so hesitant for the price they should last so much longer. He never wore them outside but a couple times to and from the car. Only wore in school during class.
2.0,Decent tie but the color in the photo is not the same as the ties I received . I ordered 3 for the groomsmen and will be returning them and buying direct from a store. The color is more of a deeper electric blue..
2.0,"My wife bought this item for one of our girls.  My daughter wore and walked the neighborhood trick or treating this past Halloween for around 1 1/2 hours, and the darn thing just apart.<br /><br />It's cheaply made and don't recommend it!"
2.0,"Not like these are a long term purchase, but be aware that the balls will fall off before you even get out the door. Also, the headbands aren't meant to fit any head but kids or very small-skulled adults."
2.0,"The clear are pretty big for clear, so they’re annoyingly visible. Also the rose gold I wore for only one day and the rose gold color rubbed off and turned regular gold. It got returned."
2.0,"Very thin, not very good material"
2.0,Was not pleased with this bag. The leather is stiff and scratchy. I did like all the pockets but too stiff to try to put stuff in.
2.0,It's thin plastic
2.0,"Poor quality, the soles feel like foam and are ridiculously slippery. No grip. Did not use , am returning"
2.0,"Very cute except it has NO support for your breasts. Would be perfect if it did, I only wear this around the pool in my yard. Would never wear it to the beach as it's very unflattering in the chest. area."
2.0,"I really like the way this looks on this model. When I got it, it was very long - dragged on the floor, and just did not fit me well. It would be nice if plus size dresses would be modeled by plus size models."
2.0,I returned it but was not interested in ordering another one
2.0,"First, I had to cut off all the sewing threads dangling here and there. I am now testing them for durability."
2.0,This hat isn’t adjustable and way too small for a men’s head. I’m going to return but still a hassle. Description misleading.
2.0,I bought these pants for winter fishing. Not sure how warm they would be if warn in the cold by themselves as I where them under some pretty heavy duty ice fishing bibs. They seem reasonable well made. I did order I size or to larger than I would if ordering in US as they are made in Asia and they fit fine. Over all I would say worth the money they were relatively cheap and they haven't fallen apart after a couple months use.<br />(amendment to review and ratings follows)<br />:These pants seem alright at first but after one washing they look like I have had them for three years! also some of the stitching is now coming out. I wish China would stop making such cheap crappy stuff! I guess its my owm fault for continually falling for the &#34;bargain&#34; priced item with at least mediocre reviews. I think probably all of us wouldn't mind paying a little above bargain price as long as we knew quality and longevity was there. Unfortunately there are no guarantees which leaves us trial and error shopping. Amazon cannot be beat for this kind of shopping they have taken care of me as a customer from day one. I have a hard time shopping anywhere else now. Even companies I have been a customer to for over ten years like sportsmansguide and cabelas cannot touch amazons service when it comes to keeping the customer happy and having low prices. The way my other shopping experiences have been going I will probably eventually not even consider anything not shipped by amazon. But I digress bottom line these pants are not worth the price
2.0,"The first time I wore it, a charm fell off.  The charms are all super cute.  I make jewelry myself, so I was able to put the jack charm back on.  Received as a gift."
2.0,"While these earrings are so cute, the black ring around them fell off within the first couple of days. The backs of the earrings wouldn’t screw or or stay together. When sleeping the earrings would get lost before we could even return them. Had them for a week. It was a waste."
2.0,"Es muy grande, el ziper es difícil de abrir y cerrar"
2.0,"Should have know by the price it wasn't worth it.<br />Just a cheap safety pin to hold it on the shirt. Just love the idea of ""stabbing"" a pin towards my throat."
2.0,"It's very cute. My daughter was excited to receive it, she wore it maybe 10 minutes and it stopped working. Hopefully it's just the battery."
2.0,The length of the pant fit perfectly when I bought it. However after a single wash the pant shrunk by a few inches in length and now I am unable to use it. I had bought a grey one initially and that didn’t shrink with washes but the black one did. I am very disappointed with the purchase of black pant with loops.
2.0,Very cheap material.  quite tight along bust line.  I am a 36d and a large was too small.
2.0,I had high hopes for this dress (ordered white) but sadly I will be returning as it is very thin and see through. Perhaps another color would look letter than the white. Fit is true to size.
2.0,My wife bought this crap.
2.0,The dress keeping pulling up
2.0,It would be perfect if there was gemstones in it.
2.0,"Short, see-through and a weird polyester material.  Not a fan of the dress in beige with blue flowers."
2.0,"The comfort is fine, but the picture is barely recognizable as chewbacca. The product image is very misleading."
2.0,Cute suit. Noticed pilling on day 1 of beach and pool use. The adjustable strap kept slipping off of my 3 (3T) year olds shoulder. Too late to return. Have to pay seemstress to adjust. Not the best quality.
2.0,"This was supposed to fit a 5 foot tall, 90 lbs. girl. It was too small to the point of it being snug all around. Returned it."
2.0,My husband liked the quality and workmanship. Outdoor adventure activities!! He thinks this watch is the best watch he has ever owned..
2.0,There is an obvious bad stitching in the shoulders making it look like permanent fold and inside the neck area it looks like a tag has been ripped off.
2.0,"Dress was so wrinkled, steamed multiple times, and had no tags, skeptical it may have already been worn."
2.0,"I was excited to open the box but did not even get it on my finger before one of the bands broke. They are cute, but the rose gold is a strange color and the opals look more like moon stones. Aside from the band breaking I still would have worn these for fun. I knew I would not be getting perfection for the price  They were cute when all three of the rings (including the broken one)  were put together."
2.0,I  could see through it
2.0,"The bands are not really as described. “Deep Gray” is certainly a light gray. And “Mix Black” is more purple than black.  Good quality band, but not what I had expected."
2.0,to short I am 5'6 and pulling these the crotch portion is about 4 inches down my thigh.
2.0,This is my second Tasada purchase. This sports bra isn't as comfortable as Tasada's full coverage style.  Not enough coverage on the sides.  The fabric is very soft on both.
2.0,"It was too big, looked cheap, and broke instantly"
2.0,It broke after a month or so.
2.0,"Got a free hair tie in the package which is adorable. However, the shirt itself is nothing like the images. It's a cheap, plain t-shirt material and looks it. Looks kind of gross and cheap if I'm honest, like a yucky, ugly t shirt someone's already worn to the gym. There's literally no texture to the shirt, super cheap, not soft at all material, it's nothing like the images. Really disappointed because I only ordered the shirt because I fell in love with the images."
2.0,"I'm admittedly a large woman, which is why I need Spanx. The other reviews said these would stay up...they did NOT. Returning."
2.0,Beautiful tail but broke easily and quickly
2.0,"Very thin, looks very different in person compared to the picture. Looks like it will not withstand one washing !! Not pleased at all."
2.0,"even after reading the chart and measurements I ordered a 2x and it is still snug.  the material is a bit rough out of the bag so i am not sure if it will soften when washed.  but the Lace on the back is very cute.  I do like the gray stripping though.  I am going to pass this on to a friend though as I am sure she will love it, and she is smaller size than me."
2.0,"There needs to be better descriptions for clothing items - knit/woven fabric, new type fabric (feels like), ie>  what is viscose?"
2.0,"The material is nice, but the pockets sit so funny. Yuck. Looks cheap. Unfortunately, I bought two of them."
2.0,It was all the rage to figure out an optimal way to protect yourself during COVID.  But the cheap plastic didn't work out well for anyone.  I never ended up wearing this.
2.0,Fabric not as expected.
2.0,These hurt! The way the jewels are held into the jewelry hurts and the jewel looks like a plastic bead with glitter glued on. I expected better quality.
2.0,Too difficult to put on.  More compression on chest area than on the problematic mid-section that most people need.
2.0,We had to return it because the neck hole was way too big for my six year old. It slid off his shoulder.
2.0,Just got these in the mail today. Colors were nice but.. 2 of the tanks were stained nasty like something was spilled on them. And strings were coming out of the seams like they were worn. Don't feel like returning them all so I'm just going to throw the two stained ones away and keep the other 2. Will not buy these ever again.
2.0,Color looked the same in person. Nice for the price.
2.0,"Button / Decoration Missing from Costume<br />The cape is amazing, the shirt is missing button.<br />Unable to wear for Halloween party as I don’t have time to get someone to sew it back on before the event. I wish someone would have looked at the item BEFORE sending it to me. What a disappointment."
2.0,Pictures of product show horizontal but received vertical instead
2.0,"5'2 ~130 lb and typically wear an XS - ordered a small and this fits like a loose, baggy potato sack. Completely unflattering."
2.0,"These were fine for about 2 months. The blue is nice, bright, and snazzy. Then, out of nowhere, one of the laces broke apart. It's nice that there are 3 pairs, but I would have preferred something a little longer-lasting."
2.0,"I don't care for it. The mask smells so bad, I want to gag when I put it on and it's too big for my head so it doesn't fit me right."
2.0,"Shirt was way too large. I followed the sizing chart for my chest which measured 43&quot;. It seems to be close to a xxlarge. Way too big for me. I even washed it hoping it would shrink. Still was to big. The length was ok, it is the width that got me. Waste of my money."
2.0,I love the design and I got it for my husband for Christmas and the wind up doesn't work!! Update... I requested a refund and they never gave me my money back!
2.0,Size not accurate. Smaller than normal.
2.0,"While the colors are very attractive, the leather is very stiff and some of the beads are cracked and irregular at the top edges. It is also a bit larger than the specifications indicate, so if your wrists are slender this will disappoint."
2.0,Not as appears. Very cheaply made and not worth the money
2.0,"Nice sunglasses BUT run very, very small. I bought them for my 9 year old daughter and there was no way they could comfortably fit around her head. I would compare these to toddler size sunglasses not for 8-12 year olds."
2.0,"Seems sturdy except for the opening lever. For the price that they are asking, it is not worth it."
2.0,Cheap glasses. Would return them but it wouldn’t let me
2.0,"Same material that the $4 flip flops you buy from the dollar store are made of.  The bottle opener is a novelty item, because the material is so cheap it would tear apart the first time you use it.  I gave two stars only because I had no grief returning it."
2.0,"First, these earrings are HUGE!  So much larger than I expected.  They also look very cheap.  The weight is good as they don't weigh down your ears.  Personally, they are not my style at all.  I can't imagine ever wearing them.  They remind me of something that little girls would play with.  1.5/5 stars from me."
2.0,The sweatshirt is good quality but it does run very small. It fits more like a cropped sweatshirt rather than comfy and oversized
2.0,it didnt work i ordered because it said it was universal
2.0,"It took so long to arrive at the mailing address that the batteries were dead, therefore making the watches useless.  Cute!!!  But useless."
2.0,Pretty but very  inexpensively made
2.0,Too Small and SEE THROUGH!
2.0,"My daughter usually wears a 4/5 and so i ordered a 5/6 just to be safe, even though the reviews said it ran true to size. The pants are like capris on her and the shirt is tight and barely king enough. Great and adorable, but definitely size up!!"
2.0,"I really loved these leggings, but unfortunately the seem unraveled and they’re now totally useless. Super disappointing because they are so cute. They’re not durable so not great for working out."
2.0,"this is very short and if you are over 5'4"" I would not recommend."
2.0,Very beautiful but it was too small I’m just glad I had some time to fix it. I would recommend that more hoops be added to the chain
2.0,Maybe I’m doing it wrong but I can’t get the clasp on this watch to work and stay on.
2.0,"Nice top but waaaayyy to big. I ordered according to the given size chart, but still way to big.<br />Will be returning this item."
2.0,"There are many of these on Amazon and I chose these because of price (the reviews and the thumbnail are for some wool cap...weird). They're fine and work well, but three of them ""snapped"" and broke during use after less than a year of only using them 3x a week. The instruction booklet that comes with the kit is virtually useless. There are tiny drawings of each exercise with no description on how to do it. Even the printed entry for each exercise only describes what it's good for and has no tips on proper form, etc. Luckily, there are plenty of good videos out there to help with this, but a better guide would have been convenient."
2.0,Plasticky and gaudy... nope.
2.0,"Cute, but...I wear an 18, ordered a 20. Bottoms fit, top snug. Cup pads much closer together than normal and stiff and it looks better without them. Must cut the suit to get them out. Biggest issue for me is the bottom. &#34;Shorts&#34; are very short. The fabric doesn't fit tight at the bottom of the shorts so it feels like I'm hanging out, (if I look in a mirror I'm not), but if I bend at all my bottom gets a breeze and anybody behind me sees an image that will traumatize them for months. If I'd tried on in a store I never would have purchased.<br />Top is cute with modifications.<br />Bottom will need a substitution."
2.0,I liked the idea but the way the heml line lays bunches up. I keep putting it on then taking it off before I leave the house.
2.0,the frame is too small and low quality.
2.0,"Loved the dress. Took it on vacation and as soon as I washed it, the straps began coming apart. Not great when I had planned on wearing this dress often on my trip."
2.0,I bought this as a gift for someone who has several of the Dri-Fit hats. This hat fit nothing like the others and is WAY too small.
2.0,Wore it once and it broke.  Disappointed.
2.0,"This garment was too large and too ugly to keep. I sent it back quickly. The zipper felt rather cheap. The dress was unflattering to my body (personal note) and I was overall unsatisfied with the quality. Maybe it will work better for you, because it sure looks better in the pictures. I guess I would order it (Prime) and try, but it's not my first choice. For the price, I hoped for better quality. I suggest purchasing this product weeks in advance of your event for optimal fit and style preference (ie time to return and find something else)."
2.0,Didn't like it! Come with black spots. In the picture looks more better! So sad because it was to a present!
2.0,"The fabric is soft and flowy but is incredibly thin and see through. According to the size chart it said I should order an extra large but I normally wear a medium, so I went for a large to hopefully split the difference. The bottom half fit okay but the top was huge on me. The neckline went well below my bust. I feel like if I ordered a medium I would fit the top but then it would be too small in the hips. As others have mentioned it might be fixable if the straps were adjustable. It would be a decent cheap nightgown for some, but it was very unflattering on me."
2.0,"The quality is very high, adjusting the length is easy and it looks like original bracelet. If it works well, it's worth every penny. That's all good that I can say about it because it didn't work for me. I put it on Casio Marlin dive watch, it looked very well but putting it on was a major hustle. The spring bar is held by two hooks located very close to each other in the middle of the bracelet giving a lot of play for both ends of the spring bars. Not like in the leather bands where spring bars a held in place firmly and are easy to position in place by wiggling the band. Here putting the ends of the spring bars in place is very hard because they move freely in every direction. But this is not the worst. In case of my watch, the hooks were too close to the end of the bracelet  causing the bars to bend in the middle and not fully secure their ends in the watch. It looked ok but the next day one of the spring bars disengaged and the watch fell off my hand. I should return it but it's so inexpensive and it looks so good that I decided to keep it. Maybe it will work better with another watch."
2.0,I have small wrists. This is too big.
2.0,It's been 4 months and already has holes in it.
2.0,It started to fall apart the moment I got it out of the bag and it hasn't stopped since. thankfully I make jewelry and can fix the jump rings.
2.0,I used on my caso I watch but the band is shorter than original
2.0,"A D Bra needs more than 2 hooks, th hold You in place.  That might help!"
2.0,product fell apart after third time of wear!! Very cheaply made!!
2.0,The shirt was was too short .
2.0,"Supposed to fit 23.6&#34;-39.4&#34; waist, however the thick, broad elastic is squeezing my 29&#34; waist to death and making my flesh bulge above and below the waistband. Very disappointing. I recommend these only if you have a 27&#34; or smaller waist. I returned them."
2.0,"The tank fits perfectly, BUT I would suggest not to buy because it has poor stitching and this gets me really MAD... When I buy new clothing I don't buy to have holes or the stitching is coming undone."
2.0,ok  but not impressed
2.0,The snakeskin blouse was FAR MORE gold/copper in color than what was pictured. It also looked cheap so I'm returning it.
2.0,I’m typically a 6 in jeans and went for a 7 (28) since the 5 wasn’t available to try. They were super soft and fit like a glove except the waist! I’m talking like 4-5 inches too big in the waist. Unwearable. My waist measures exactly 28” so this didn’t make sense to me.
2.0,I ordered a dark purple dress to wear for pre wedding events but the dress isn’t even close to purple. At best it is a very cloudy day blue. I’ll wear it I suppose. I’m very very disappointed. The pockets also droop very badly. I could deal with the pockets if the dress was any shade of purple but it’s not. Will not order from this company again. Buyer beware.
2.0,"Not as cute as picture, and is very wrinkley"
2.0,"Only received 4 pair instead of 8. We like the few we did receive,  however I wish we had gotten what we paid for."
2.0,Nice.  But NOT AT ALL like the photo.  Order at your own risk.  The bracelet is pretty but not what I wanted.<br /><br />Signed: Surprised
2.0,The hat was too big and my ponytail has to be at the bottom in order for it to work. It goes over my ears and I had to fold it other wise it makes it hard to hear.
2.0,Creí que se iba ajustar a mi pero esta muy grande y pienso q con el uso se va a estirar mas 🙈
2.0,Do not get this unless you have a LARGE chest and are ok with no support. It's a nice color and the bottoms aren't bad but the top is really odd.
2.0,"The pictures in the listing make these pants look light and almost satin/crepe-like. But in fact it is thick like sweatpants. The leopard pattern is printed on top of the thick material, not cute or attractive, but the size is right and sewing seems okay, so at least they should be comfortable for house pants."
2.0,Didn’t work as we needed it to
2.0,"Pretty colors, plan to use in another project. The rocks are huge."
2.0,"Pretty and felt like a great material but didn't fit right.  To small, had to send it back"
2.0,The item was to small from the knee down. I got a medium.
2.0,The dress was very see through and too small
2.0,"These earrings are very nice looking but I had a couple of issues.  First, they are very large, about 2 inches in diameter.  I would have been happier if they were 1/2 the size.  Second, I tried to put them in my ears but the space between the front and back is so small that I almost pinched my earlobe trying to get it fastened in the back.  These earring are just not for me so I returned them.  Now that's a decision I am happy with."
2.0,comfortable but too expensive - holes in heels too soon for the money
2.0,"These leggings are a comfortable material, very sleek. They are very long, and I am 5' 7"". These bunched around my ankles and I also had to continuously pull the waist back up every few minutes. They don't seem to stay in place."
2.0,"I don’t know what I was thinking! I’m 6’1” fmr college/professional athlete with long legs/muscular trunk. These work for delicate short guys or men like Bobby Hill’s grandpa (Cotton Hill)! However, it is a cool concept."
2.0,"Cute and soft, but way too small. I wear small/medium and got a medium. I wish I got a large or even an XL. It’s also very short, which isn’t a problem because it’s meant to be cropped. However, the sleeves are just so short that it looks ridiculous. Returned. Would have bought in a larger size but they are all out."
2.0,"First of all, this skirt came very stinky! Pew !!!!<br />As a mom of young children, you may relate to the baby poop color of this skirt.<br /><br />I don’t like the fit, trying to wear it high waist or regular waist.<br />I think the person wearing this needs to have a tiny waist and zero tummy for this to hang properly.<br /><br />The design pattern of the skirt section is pretty, but the smell, color, and waist-fit doesn't make this wearable for me.<br />Not a fan. 2 stars."
2.0,I've had this bag less than a week. Great size to carry personal items to work. Love it but the inside zipper has already broke and the main zipper doesn't go the entire width of the bag. Good for my purpose but I wouldn't use it for an actual purse because I don't think it's very secure.
2.0,Way to much for beanie
2.0,Like it but runs too small. More like a large. Need to send back or give as a gift.
2.0,This looked more like a bra than a top to wear in public.  I returned this.
2.0,Too heavy for my ears. Returned.
2.0,"This sweater is super comfy and looks great on, but i washed it on gentle and hung to dry ONCE and the next time i wore it, the entire left arm seam came undone exposing my whole inner arm. Embarrassing while at work :( I’m hoping the seller sees this and offers to make it right with either a credit or a replacement. Didn’t want to spend money on having it fixed just after one cleaning."
2.0,way too big and slipped off all the time.
2.0,"Let me start off by saying I received this coat pretty fast in the mail, it came in about two or three days. There was no damage ti the coat at all. I have to say I am a bit disappointed in this coat, the first thing is that is way to small and I ordered a size bigger than I would normally get. I also have to say that nothing about this is very warm at all. I would say it is equal to that of a hoodie when it come to warmth. If you are looking for a warm coat this is not the one you want to purchase. It looks cute in the picture but it nothing like how it really is."
2.0,Really junky. They’re like the cheapest plastic ever invented and just don’t feel right on your face (coming from someone who never spends over $15 on sunglasses).
2.0,"I will be returning this item.Although they are a good fit , they look more like pajama bottoms. Not for outdoor wear."
2.0,The top was great. The pants were to loose in the thighs and the shorts didn’t fit. Sizing Inconsistent
2.0,The shoehorn is very narrow and the connection to the arm is flimsy. Its not working well
2.0,"Its ok but i wouldn't recommend it. The quality isnt great. The stitching isnt finnished properly. The material is cheap, does not breath, does not fit comfortably, slides off the shoulders. Personally I feel like I wasted my money."
2.0,"JUST got them moments ago in the mail, took them out, cleaned them and went to screw them on. While I was screwing them on a gem fell out I then took a moment to look at the jewelry. I noticed the gems aren't actually secured down with an acrylic coat or clear layer. They're just placed around the rim of the plug and prone to falling apart. I'm giving them 2 stars because I know I can fix this myself. I applied a clear coat of nail polish around the top to fill in the gaps and hold the gems down. So far it looks good."
2.0,The dress looks more like a shirt... haha. I'm disappointed. The fabric is see-through and cheap material.
2.0,Decent quality fabrics and filter. But it’s a print screen whereas I though it would be actually textured sparkles.
2.0,Its too big for a cross body bag
2.0,"Loved the pattern but it looked like I was wearing a parachute because of those pockets. Also, weird seam across the chest."
2.0,I returned these sunglasses. They were so big they fell off every time I bent my head. They would be great if they fit well.
2.0,Was nothing like was pictured. The material was polyester not cotton. The fit was tight not lose. The neckline was not v cut. Just truly disappointed.
2.0,They look very cheap. Nothing like the picture.
2.0,"This was not a sweatshirt, it is super short and definitely don't put it in the dryer. I am only 5'2&#34; and it is too short."
2.0,not impressed.<br />the posts are way too small and pinch the ear lobs when tightening enough to prevent them falling off
2.0,I was looking for these types of socks without a toe seam as it is painful when I am on my feet all day.  I am returning all 6 socks.
2.0,It is much longer than pictured. It hangs over the knuckle too far and gets in the way of function.<br />Slightly too large to be true to size when fitting around the finger
2.0,this is a really loose knit beanie and although it calls itself  &#34;skull cap&#34; beanie its not exactly snug and doesn't keep my head very toasty at all.
2.0,if you have small ears this is not for you at all mine kept falling off my ears no matter what adjustments I made
2.0,Verrrryyy large.
2.0,It wasn’t the size I expected.
2.0,"Two stars for the functionality of the keychain. However, the listing is not accurate. These beads are made of painted wood. They are not silicone."
2.0,"Bought 4 pairs for friends trip to Tahoe. Unfortunately, I am returning one because of a defective print, so one person (me) will be without matching socks for the trip tomorrow. I question the size range of 6-11 implying it fits men too. I’m a size 7 women and it fits too perfect, so I think the range is meant for women, not men. Only thing great about this item is the thickness, it will keep us warm in snowy Tahoe."
2.0,Do not order unless it’s for an adult. Bought this for my son since it says boys/ girls. Bought a large expecting maybe a 12/14 in kids. It fits me and I wear an adult medium.<br />Thinner material. If it was the right size I would have gave it 5 stars. It’s not like the polyester pullovers but my son would have loved it!
2.0,"the colors are not as bright and it looks like it's made of cheap thin brass or something. kind of crap, to be honest."
2.0,Shirt feels fine and fits great but screen printing is horrible.  You can not read the words at all on the shirt.  Picture lies!!! Just looks like I have floating pumpkins over my chest!
2.0,"Fits perfect ,nice material , arrived on time, but not enough protection so I added because I want more layers a disposable mask behind it, but this is a perfect size for adults will covering your face 👍🏽"
2.0,"Great socks but they are small to begin with and shrink with first washing.  Unless your shoe size (male) is an 8 or smaller, these don’t fit."
2.0,It would have been great had the fit been appropriate.
2.0,Loved the design and length.  But the magnetic does not secure well enough and often my ID falls off.  So I will have to put my old one back on.  A bit pricey for plastic beads that I can not wear.
2.0,Turn neck green
2.0,Inner side of class will be fogged when start swimming. Although pretty.
2.0,So cute but way too small 😞
2.0,Huge! Not at all what I thought I was ordering.
2.0,It broke after 3 months of use.
2.0,Buyer beware - I would not purchase knowing what I know now.  I am 5' 115 lbs and purchased the white sunflower dress in size small.  Lots of room & fit right at the knees. I liked the material and it was comfortable so I purchased 3 more.  MISTAKE. The next 3 were nothing like the first one I received.  All 3 although purchased a small and all were marked small they were completely different sizes. The navy sunflower was 3 times the size - looked like an xlarge.  The floral02 not as large as the navy sunflower but could of fit as a large. The material all listed to be polyester/ cotton were also all different. The floral02 material so shiny that it looked like ridiculous. The white turtle was so thin you could read through it. The print design was nice on all so this is a big disappointment. Will never wear these because they are so big and seller does not pay for return so a complete waste of money. To ship back to china is expensive so will be losing money.
2.0,Read the reviews so ordered up a size but still way too small. Returned and ordered a different product.
2.0,"Idk how 🤔 the other lady is wearing ""her""  mask(s) 😷<br />But ummmm, as for myself,<br />I place on face, properly. Meaning both nose and mouth fully covered. And when I did, it felt like I was straining to get only one nostril worth of oxygen. Terrible fabric too ,w/ regard to staining. Gets dirty quick&doesn't wash easily. So disappointed 😞 I love 'Dem Boyz""~ 🏈"
2.0,"As a petite Latina woman, I'm certainly curvy enough, but my boobs would not for the life of me work with this thing. It did nothing for them. There's no inner support so if you have DDs like I do, you better hope they're perky enough to make this dress come to life (since I'm still looking for a strapless bra that makes huge boobs look good).<br />If you have a smaller chest, go for it. The material was pretty solid. But if you're big-chested, not even a larger size will help."
2.0,"Way too fat to fit on the slide charms I had, which are pretty standard; they fit on other slide bracelets that I've purchased. Maybe it's the silicone. I tried using Pam to slip the charms on, made it even harder, lol. I had to trim the sides of the bracelet with scissors.. so hopefully they hold up!"
2.0,REALLLLLY REALLY SMALL! It literally fits my 9lb. dog!
2.0,I have bought &#34;allegrace&#34; brand items before and loved them but this shirt fits very strange and is an odd scratchy material
2.0,The &#34;Rose gold&#34; color of the band is extremly different than the original rose gold color of the watch. Returning it!
2.0,"All pieces arrived, packaged great.  After wearing the blue swirls for one week, I took them out to gauge up only to notice that the black dots had vanished. Same with the white tunnels, the dots can literally be rubbed off.  Also, on one of the tunnels, it chipped when unscrewing it.  Maybe acrylic isn't the way to go."
2.0,Cheap… broke super easily.
2.0,"The style of the hat is adorable but it was folded during delivery, and I cannot get the rim of the hat to straighten out. So it's just a floppy mess when I attempt to wear it."
2.0,"The purse looks cute, but a little big for my taste.  It has been airing out for over a month now and I still can not get rid of that horrible smell."
2.0,Didn’t hold up. Broken before 1 year. I keep them in a case if I’m not wearing them.
2.0,They were pretty but the metal turned green after a couple weeks..
2.0,Does not fit at all. Runs too small
2.0,"The truth bracelet is of very poor quality, not well done and I did not like at all."
2.0,It was ok for the price and quality is not that good
2.0,The material feels like thin curtains and is difficult to wear for it as the white fabric easily shows what's underneath<br />It could be worn if for a small chest
2.0,"These are so cute. HOWEVER, they are very narrow in the front l so be aware. After 4 hours, they were rubbing my toes so badly I had to take them off. I wear a 9.5/10 depending and the 10s were still too tight in the toe area. They fit well length wise though (if you like smushed toes.) I will return which is unfortunate because I had such high hopes."
2.0,"Nice looking watch.  The instructions say it may be off two or three minutes daily.  You also shouldn't try to adjust the time between 9pm and 3am or it will reduce the lifetime of the watch.<br /><br />After carefully following the instructions to wind it, mine turned out to be defective."
2.0,"terrible, maybe my expectations were wrong but ....you  have to have the item 1 inch from the glasses to see it clearly ... how can you do any work when it is that close ????"
2.0,that most definitely is not a 2xl/3xl
2.0,"Hug my face far too tight, extreme curvature in the design. Only recommended for those without eyelashes, or a substantial honker that will keep them from practically touching your eyes. Otherwise they will annoy the crap out of you."
2.0,"I bought this for my mom for mothers day.  She LOVED it, however, within a couple of months the rhinestones started to fall out.  She's had it for 6 months now and it has lost quite a few of the rhinestones...totally bummed!  She can't even wear it anymore!"
2.0,"It's cut well/fits well, but that's about all I can say for it. It only has adhesive around the very edge, not all over it, which shows a line around the border that stood out to my perfectionist self. It has a grid pattern of tiny dots all over it, it attracts fingerprints like Twilight attracts teenage girls, and it feels like plastic, not glass (it might be glass, but doesn't feel like it compared to other glass screen protectors I've used before)<br /><br />All around very let down, I took it off right away and I'll be looking for a different one..."
2.0,Just got it and only wear it once but it already broke (the initial gold) so now i can’t wear it again very disappointed.
2.0,"Cheap. Broke on me this first time I wore, it also turned my skin green.😭"
2.0,The ring itself is nice but the lettering is so tiny you can not see what it says.
2.0,Super rough face to the ring because after engraving the letters they don't buff it at all making all the letters scratchy and catch on everything.
2.0,This was very shear materiel and I didn't like the way it fit.
2.0,"Not the dress that is pictured. Not even close to the fullness of tulle. Does not come with accessories if that is also misleading to anyone. I was so excited to give this to my daughter for Christmas, it will have to do, but to say I’m disappointed is an understatement."
2.0,We wanted this watch to retrain sleep habits and quit sugar but our watch just doesn't function properly.  It continually disconnects from the app and bluetooth and it shocks my husband or I at times when an alert was not set.  We read the guide through and through again so it isnt a user error.  It's a great idea - I think the technology needs adjustments and the bugs need to be worked out much better before it goes to market for this type of price tag.
2.0,The USA reminds me when iron on lettering just came out .. super shiny and cheap looking.  Sweatshirt runs very big.  Not impressed and will not wear out of the house.
2.0,"I ordered two of these bracelets for Christmas presents, and they were not adjustable as described. I did however return them and had no issues with the return and my money was credited back in a very timely manner."
2.0,You can not wear these for longer than a day my holes look so huge and some have puss. Pretty upset thinking this set would work
2.0,"I saw these socks on Amazon and put them on my wish list thinking they were exactly what I was looking for.  Seeing other reviews now I wish I hadn't. I'm not disappointed with the thin nature of the socks even though they are advertised as athletic but I am extremely disappointed in how small they are.  I am a shoe size 10 and any other brand stating they fit up to size 10 has always fit me.  However, these would not stay on my feet at all. I had to pass the entire set on to my shoe size 7 daughter and will have to look somewhere else for cute socks. The colors and pattern variety are adorable for any age, just wish they had fit."
2.0,not much support for bigger busts
2.0,"I am a medium, I ordered a large so that I would be baggy.  It was still way too small."
2.0,These were more like bright tangerine. Not what we expected.
2.0,"Sizing was off, pants barely made it halfway down my shins and I am by no means a tall man."
2.0,Two stars because it was cute. The top was way too small for a dd and the skirt was really long.
2.0,A little skimpy on material.
2.0,These pants are such a weird and cheap material. I still like them and will wear them but the product is definitely not worth the money spent...
2.0,"The calf width was too wide for me. I should have ordered slim width. The length of the shoe is too small. I normally wear a size 8 but usually have to size down to 7.5. I ordered an 8 in this shoe and it was exact. An 8.5 would have been better. I'm 5'7"" and shoe came up to just under my knee. Sole of the shoe is too slick. Overall it was okay. Not a great buy."
2.0,"The waist is nothing like what is described or pictured. The under lining of the top lace portion of the dress has no structure. It doesn't cover half of my chest. (I'm very chesty, but I bought 2; one for me and one for my friend who is a Large and has a size B cup in chest)<br />The waist isn't fitted at all, but totally an empire waist, which made both of us look pregnant.<br />The lining inside was floppy and didn't cover even half of our bras!<br />Too bad!"
2.0,"I don't care for it. I had something very similar but lost it. Ordered this one, wouldn't get another one. It's harder to get out of pocket, and the credit cards are near to impossible to remove. The leather one I had was much more friendly"
2.0,"It was a pretty necklace that I would've loved to wear, but it came broken :("
2.0,The back of the heel rubbed my heel raw after a mile with a 30 pound bag. Had to switch back to basic training boot for rest of the movement.
2.0,"The fit was fine, but the pockets were way too high, just under my boobs. Totally unusable pockets and I also didn't care for the zipper pulls. The hood material was reminiscent of a garbage bag slightly. I wish this had worked out but I had to return as it just wasn't going to work for me."
2.0,After only having these for two months and light use. One of the two flip flops blew out. They were very comfortable but that makes these a not so great buy.
2.0,Just readily not a flattering shadow t shirt for women. But it was an inexpensive alternative to an awkward looking costume.
2.0,The seams were sewn poorly.
2.0,I have multiple bobs shoes all in size 7 they fit perfectly but these do not fit the same. They fit about a half size too small and run very wide. They are also a bit tight when slipping on and off. Doesn't have to nice memory foam bottoms like other bobs slip on shoes. Returning and not replacing just not for me.
2.0,"Super cute, but WAYYYYYY TO TIGHT.  I am normally a medium to large.  I purchased a large.  It's going back, unfortunately.  Sad."
2.0,"Super cute in the picture, actually super frumpy and the seam lines in the chest are annoying and uncomfortable."
2.0,"The pin keeps falling out of our sons watch. It only lasted a few weeks, maybe a month. Disappointed because we like it otherwise."
2.0,"Too big, was a gift for granddaughter. Sent back."
2.0,Love the color and the style but it’s a lot smaller than I had expected! Need a larger size!
2.0,Was smaller than expected . Got it for my teen and it fit for a little girl.
2.0,I only gave this two stars because it fit and was true to size but my cleavage was a bit to exposed for me to wear it to work or anywhere really except for the house. I also recieved a different item than what's in the pictures. My item did not have a lace up front which would have maybe helped with the cleavage issue. The material is also very thin and I found a hole in the waist seam after the first wash. It may have already been there as it was in a super hidden spot at my side at the waist. I also gave it two stars because I can wear it if I put a cute dress over it or a long sweater or shirt. The straps are cute showing and dont look like bra straps. Over all as long as you dont want to wear it by itself to look work professional and you dont mind thin material it's just an ok buy.
2.0,"Apperance & color are great,<br />but I thought they'd be a little bigger, I still wear them as ill be looking for more!<br />Thank you"
2.0,"Worked okay for a week - and then it broke.  The strap broke off, in a place where it can't really be fixed.  So now I have to use it without the necklace - which kind of defeats the purpose."
2.0,"Although very cute, the photograph is misleading. I thought the dress had layers of multi-colored tulle. Instead, there are layers of tulle which are cut into narrow streamers and sewn at the waist. They would very easily get caught on car seat straps  and other things and be pulled off. The underskirt is a very thin batiste-type material, almost see through. I did not see a product description listed, only product precautions. I saw no fiber content listed (it is 100% cotton with polyester, which I think is the tulle.) The shipping was prompt and came sooner than expected. I gave this a 2 because I don't think it is durable. I returned it."
2.0,"Cute, just too small. I'm a size 16 and the largest one didn't fit."
2.0,Rings were really cool designs. But they all broke with just normal wear in a couple weeks.
2.0,I ordered a 18mm but received a 22mm. It is was to big for my watch and not worth the cost to return.
2.0,The lenses are distorted somehow and cause your vision to be blurry. You can only use them if you don't need to see out of them. Complete waste of money.
2.0,They run very small..
2.0,Would've given 5 stars but one look at the tag. Made in China..... really? 😑
2.0,"I have been using this band continually since I got it. Left it on twice in the shower too. It’s holding up. No color loss. The magnet end does scratch and pull my satin pillowcase, I use the watch as a sleep tracker, so be aware of this.  Otherwise, great. It does NOT catch on my cotton clothes or nylon jackets. It does not noticeably loosen up. I will be getting another for my daughter.<br /><br />Update: I ordered the same band for my daughter. It looks the same, but is NOT. The magnet does not stay in place. It also slips through the loop. Not very useful. I traded with her, and compared the 2. Not happy."
2.0,"Too Big, Hard to keep closed."
2.0,"I don't know if the mask is good, I'll be returning it because it came in a plastic bag, with holes, no box, thats not safe"
2.0,"Not how I expected it, looks cheap and table cloth.  I'll not buy it again.  Size is good."
2.0,"Although the colors were outstanding, this was the most ill fitting JM Collection top I have ever bought. Extremely disappointed. I should have returned it."
2.0,Too small. Ordered a size larger but apparently needed two sizes larger.  Returning top.
2.0,Flowers look off white. shoes are soft and wide.
2.0,"I really like them, unfortunately the one I was really looking forward to was defective."
2.0,Not up to the expectations.
2.0,"I am missing the 10 pink butterfly charms, and instead was sent only 40 charms."
2.0,Too tiny!  These are so small they literally can get lost in your piercing hole. Certainly not worth the money.
2.0,This is a beautiful dress but it fits funny.  The neck was too high for me and I returned the dress.
2.0,I didn't know I was allergic to the silecone so they didn't work for me...Still in the pack they came in..
2.0,"Once I attached it to my samsung watch the band wouldn't come off--so I guess I'm keeping it forever! And, the thin strip you slide the excess band into rubs the skin painfully, so I removed it."
2.0,"The top was too huge on me, had to return. I didn’t even try on the bottoms, but I could tell the cut was pretty cheeky."
2.0,The shirt is true to size. I’m disappointed because it looks more purple than blue.
2.0,2 pairs had holes in them. Threw them away.  Didnt want to return the other 4 pairs.  Otherwise perfect
2.0,Disappointed this came straight from China and was probably a knock off of someone's original design. They also have no idea how to label things. It says it's 100% cotton which it certainly is not as it's very stretchy and has a polyester-like feel. They also claim that you can only dry clean but it certainly can be run through on any cycle and not be effected. I just get the feeling that this is not an honest seller I should be buying from. I much prefer things to ship from the US and not take weeks to arrive also.
2.0,"broken chain, other wise cute"
2.0,"2nd update: I hadn't worn the ring in a couple months, started wearing it again for a couple weeks, and today the rose completely fell off.  I guess you get what you pay for, but I'm pretty sad about it because I really liked it.<br /><br />Update: I’ve had the ring for a little over a week now, and it has not been spinning quite as well and is now a little noisier than when I first got it. Not an issue, but I was hoping it would stay “perfect” a little longer<br /><br />The ring is really pretty and spins very well, but I expected it to be more of an orangy-peach, and it is pretty much rose gold.  It is really pretty and can fit any finger, and I've already gotten compliments on it."
2.0,"Lasted one week of vacation in FL. Stretched out quickly. He liked how they looked, but they fell off constantly."
2.0,The edges are not smooth therefore will catch on your clothing and we didn't like the way it attached to the wrist.  We returned it.
2.0,You get what you pay for.. cheap
2.0,"Not true to size, size up when ordering."
2.0,"I would have given 5 stars IF one of the blouses (the red one) had a tag hanging on the size label and was in a original bag like the others that I purchased from this brand LuckyMore…<br />When I looked to the package I though that a toddler folded the blouse and put in the first plastic bag he saw in front of him…<br />It looked used…maybe it was a returned item ?<br />I don’t like it, I’ll never buy from this brand again, the quality is too inconsistent…"
2.0,Cute but did not fit well
2.0,"The color of the blouse is totally opaque, nothing to see as shown in the photo, is too big, and looks like old."
2.0,"The dress is beautiful,  just like the pictures but I you have any type of boots, it's not for you. It runs small in the chest, no stretch at all"
2.0,Socks are very thin. I expected more cushion for an athletic sock.  I would not buy these socks again.
2.0,The material on the outside of the hoodie is really itchy/rough and is just overall not great especially because I have eczema and it just catches onto my skin.. gross. Even on my skin that's perfectly healthy it itches and just feels weird.
2.0,Horrible so small maybe for newborn baby!
2.0,I ordered these for my wife and when she opened her package they were broken. pretty much the sunglasses were very flimsy and she could not wear them. They were package very poorly.
2.0,"cheaply made, bunch of different sizes. garbage mostly. they threw random things in the bag too, like paper clips etc"
2.0,"This dress is a bit small in the bust area, leaving exposed gaps in between buttons. It is also too long. The fabric is pretty but I feel like it wasn't made very practically. Don't like the hooks for the buttons which make it very difficult to put on and take off."
2.0,looks okay but cheap quality
2.0,Did not fit my ear lobe
2.0,the bra was a XL but the cup size couldn't fit a C cup
2.0,"does not define the face, poor clarity"
2.0,There were no instructions on setting the watch.  Not easy to use.
2.0,Ordered this watch 2 months ago and haven't received it.
2.0,"It’s a nice Looking  and feeling piece , but it broke right away, sent message no reply, fixed myself, broke again and piece is gone , messaged again, no reply , not great service"
2.0,"Clingy Material.  This is a very clingy, snug, close to the body fit.  There is no hiding anything.  I bought two sizes larger than I am and it is still too clingy.  I think the material is spandex or spandex like."
2.0,It runs small and is fitted
2.0,"I loved the look of this item but the fit is extremely off. After reading some of the reviews I decided to get a size Medium when I am normally a size Small. Even the Medium was too small! When I pulled it out of the packaging I looked at it and thought, &#34;is this made me a small child?!&#34; If you are thinking about buying this item I would go up a few sizes."
2.0,"It was a weird stretch polyester material. Would have been better in cotton. Didn’t lay right on the petticoat because the material is heavy.  Beautiful print, though."
2.0,Still much too large and I already exchanged one pair for this one which was another size down
2.0,This dress is way too long. And not flattering.
2.0,Hate it to tight and to long
2.0,pictured item and item received were totally different
2.0,"Close to impossible to get on and off. Took 2 adults to get one strap on my daughter's eyeglasses. Once it was on, the glasses were too snug on her face, so it took 2 adults to get it off. We abandoned it at the end, after a day or 2 of struggling to get a good fit without success. It's wad challenging for my 5-yr-old to get her glasses on while the strap is on them, so she had to kind of pull at the arms a little to the sides to stretch the straps to pass the glasses over her forehead, then the lenses get smudged from her forehead, & the arms almost broke each time. Then we need to take the glasses off again to clean the smudged lenses. Maybe there's some learning curve that we missed, but it's way too much work. My daughter opted for just pushing her glasses back up her nose every 15 minutes as an easier alternative."
2.0,"It’s cute, fits as expected, and is comfy, but the quality is garbage. I wore it once and both of the straps on the top broke. I’m handy and I can fix it but that’s not the point. No one buys anything like this to wear once. I’m giving it two stars because the bottoms and robe are fine and as I said, it is comfortable."
2.0,Sequence could barely walk in these pants the sequence kept rubbing against the inner thigh of my leg was not happy about it but they looked good
2.0,"I really love the design of this shirt and it was beautifully packaged in sustainable packing (love that!).  Unfortunately, the shirt itself seemed to be designed for someone with a very tiny frame and narrow shoulders.  I am quite slim with an athletic build but apparently not petite enough. I ordered a size up from my usual size and while it fit me, the cut looked like a muscle shirt. Unfortunately I’ll be returning it. The quality seems great so if you’re a tiny build it’d be a great choice!"
2.0,Sweater was decent quality but sleeves were too short. Returned it.
2.0,Loved the style and colors but the size was way too small . I gave it to my daughter who wears a size small and it fit her perfectly. Sizing is not accurate at all.
2.0,"Super cute fits perfect. But the zipper didn’t fully zip and it broke, so I ordered a new one. Same exact thing happened with the replacement. Quality sucks. Never again"
2.0,Scratchy
2.0,I made the mistake of wearing these into a swimming pool. Most of the stones fell out afterwards. The earrings were pretty but they just didn't last.
2.0,"the image no apreciate the real zise, is too short."
2.0,I bought these for my wife. They fit small. They just seem cheaply made. The straps are especially flimsy and costume like.
2.0,"At first these felt great, and they fit perfectly. It's very comfortable, probably the most comfortable socks I've ever worn. And because of the low cut, these don't show when you wear shoes so these will look great on boat shoes for example. Now here's where I come in and say, the reason I rated this 2 stars is the quality of the socks. Even though it's made of bamboo fiber, these rip EASILY. I was casually walking on my campus and out of nowhere I felt a tear where my big toe is located. And this happened to every other pair. So to warn you guys before you purchase this, these tear very easily after a few walks and jogging."
2.0,I used this product normally.  It is cheaply made.  The seams started to unravel during washing!  I already re-sewed them once and now they are unraveling in another area of the gaiter. I would not suggest purchasing this item.
2.0,Item delivered to me looked nothing like the cardigan in the photo.
2.0,Quality doesn't quite match what is picture and shirt definitely fits a little small.
2.0,"Returned. Too long on my 5'2&#34; body. Also, it just didn't fit as cute as it is in the photo. Quite the contraption. Lol!!"
2.0,Did not fit across upper chest area. Very weird. Fit everywhere else but unable to fasten the top part.
2.0,"I love the fit and feel of these socks. Seams are thin and I can't feel them with my toes I've washed and worn them for weeks in Arizona, where the weather is dry. However, my recent trip to Florida, where is was rather humid and I sweated a lot, I developed BAD rashes around the top of each sock. I only brought these socks on my trip! I folded them down and the problem went away after a few days, so my allergy to them seems limited to the top band material. Perhaps it is latex?"
2.0,"Was not sowed all the way, gaps in between stitches."
2.0,Not made to size. Arms are too small for the size I got. Otherwise it's pretty.
2.0,"Loved this purse but, I can't take the bad odor coming from inside the purse.  I even aired it out for two days and there was no difference. In process of returning."
2.0,It broke within a week of purchase.
2.0,Floral Pattern not as pictured.
2.0,"The print was cute and it shipped fast, however it's 95% polyester.  If you don't mind that then you're all good."
2.0,It wasn't as thick as I was hoping it would be...Very thin..color was very pretty
2.0,Probably will not use!
2.0,The latches are faulty a few came off while I was trying to put it on
2.0,"I thought this was a magnetic close, but it is not. You have to insert one end of the strap into the clasp and then pull it through a bit. This is awkward since you have to do it with the watch face below your wrist and then keeping the strap loose and grasping the clasp so the strap doesn't fall out, turn the watch to the top of your wrist. I am not flexible enough to do this, so the watch band is a total bust for me."
2.0,I bought this for my 5 year old who attends kindergarten and was too big on her but fits me perfectly. It’s hard finding masks in stores now!
2.0,"Ordered 3 as matching gifts, one arrived twisted and stitching came undone almost immediately"
2.0,"It keeps stopping.  I want to return it.  Can you get me a return label for that one and the other one, which , the watch band, is way to big for my wrist?"
2.0,"Thought they would be cuter, still a comfortable shoe that I wore to my office job often."
2.0,This mask is huge and not cotton....
2.0,Awful fabric. One of the items makes me never want to buy clothe online. Very bad material!
2.0,Look face from far gold too yellow
2.0,"The dress is nice.  I originally had a 2x and returned the one for a 3x.  The 3x did fit about the same.  If you don't want love handles to show this is not the dress for you or buy 2 sizes larger.  Was going to cost me $26 to return. Not worth it so I'll resell someplace else.  But again, it is a very nice dress. The 2 stars are for the terrible return policy."
2.0,Returned. Way too short to be a dress
2.0,This shirt looked (at least to me) that it would curve your top portion (the bust) and the flare out at the bottom (the tummy) but instead it hugs all your fat and exposes it to the world!
2.0,"The bra material is great strong sturdy. Smoothes back fat and gives a slimmer look. The unfortunate part is that the cups are set very close together in the front giving a pointy uniboob look in the middle of my chest, and for this I hardly wear it and give it a maybe 2 star. Makers need to consider width/spread of a plus size woman."
2.0,"These were supposed to be true to size but I found them to be a little snug. Also, after about 2 weeks the back seam of one the slippers started coming apart. I ended up needing to sew it."
2.0,Two have already broken . Within hours of wearing
2.0,inexpensive and looks it
2.0,"Took forever to arrive, and then they are so short and narrow, they look more like arm warmers! My teenage daughter wears them anyway, but only scrunched down with ankle boots, as they are too short to cover the whole leg like they should. Hardly any stretch and very cheaply made,  especially for the price. A major disappointment."
2.0,Very small. 3xl run like Medium
2.0,The sizing was way too big for being a child. Image took up 3/4 of face and not just mouth. I ended up returning which was unfortunate since my son loved the designs.
2.0,I do like the band but I don't like my green wrist. This didn't happen right away and I thought it was going to be ok but I'm going to have to return this. I've already ordered another band because the silicone band that comes with it is just too hot to wear.
2.0,Dress is cute but very thin material
2.0,"I only received the Big Brother outfit of the set advertised as Big Brother, Little Brother! The Big Brother outfit is nice, so gave it a two star rating, but very disappointing that the Little Brother outfit did not come with it. Would like this rating to result in the Little Brother outfit being sent to us!!!"
2.0,"The part that goes on your forehead is kind of long, so spongebob's face is on the top of your head"
2.0,"The shoes are cute but they're about a half size too big, maybe even a full size!"
2.0,"I like the look of this hat, but it really is just felt, with no reinforcements. It was creased from the beginning because of the packaging. It is also very shallow, so will not stay on in any gusts of wind.<br /><br />If you just want a cheap, nearly throw-away style hat, this is perfect.<br /><br />I purchased this because a nice one from Urban Outfitters was too expensive, but after buying this, I wish I had just bit the bullet and spent more on a quality hat."
2.0,"Way too big, had to poke holes in it and I’m a 34/36 waist"
2.0,Super cute but way too small and the fabric is rough feeling.
2.0,"Ordered my normal size L. Great length over rear end. Raise your arms and whole shirt comes up too high. Short on sides. Sleeve holes too large, shows bra. Neckline lost goosy, not as tailored as looks in pics. Material is amazing soft fabric. Wish it had worked out."
2.0,"None of the links line up nor are they closed, so this bracelet catches on my clothes all the time. They’re hard to close as they are stainless steel and don’t just bend, which is fine. Bracelet looks nice, seems sturdy, size is perfect for average medical ID tag. But honestly I didn’t spend $15 on something that I need to spend an hour fixing so it won’t destroy my clothes."
2.0,It rusted on my arm
2.0,"This product is large. It does not fit in my ski boots without pulling the shell open (which is a pain in the arse) (I have a mondo 26.5 with a low volume shell and custom thermo liners - about average size ski boot).<br />It gets to approximately 116 degrees Fahrenheit, which is probably safe for thermoliners, but between the size of it (8&#34; long, 2&#34; high, 2.5&#34; wide) and not having a fan, i'm going to return it.<br />I will say the ozone works well, and i'm going to build an ozone generator for deodorizing shoes."
2.0,the material was different for 2 pairs than the other 2 pairs. The white and Navy blue was a thinner material and stretched more. The grey pair and the black pair there was no hope for them going past my knee. If you are going to package something as a set they all need to be the same material. There is no way the grey and black are a United States 2x.
2.0,"Cute design, but fits quite small to size.  Length is great,  good weight on the fabric for fall. The peek-boo shoulder holes were not nearly as big as shown either.  Will re-order on larger size."
2.0,I am giving these two stars because they’re high quality but they are terrible for use. They are extremely distracting when trying to do yiga because they inhibit your flow. Toes also didn’t stay in place.
2.0,"The quality is great and I love the look of them, but mine are so baggy in the front. This creates additional front creases. I thought it would go away with washing, but they didn’t. I don’t feel comfortable wearing them outside of the house. Maybe mine were defective?"
2.0,I can not breath at all. It is very thick. The plastic sticks to your face. I was very hot.
2.0,Comes apart to easy
2.0,This came to me broken. The rope wasn't fully tied. I'll be finding a way to fix it. It's beautiful and I hope I can fix it.
2.0,"Purchased this garment for St Patrick's Day event. It arrived on time, but stuffed in a small plastic bag. The garment had major wrinkles. I washed the blouse in cold water, rinsed in fabric softener, and dried on low setting, and it still remained very, very wrinkled and unwearable. I used a steam iron and most wrinkles disappeared, but the fabric wrinkles very easily.  Ironing it wasn't easy. Also, the tie does not tie at a natural waist line, more like six inches above and it is a thin piece of fabric. I normally wear a regular size 16, but based on size chart ordered a 16 W or XXXLG. The fit is good. I am posting three pictures for others. Picture (1) right out of the bag; (2) after being washed/dried; and (3) after ironing. The fabric is suppose to be a synthetic, but it clearly isn't one that looks fresh. I will keep the garment, as the event I purchased it for is too near.  Otherwise, this blouse would definitely be returned."
2.0,"Poor quality, very cheap materials, you can literaly see through it .. I bought it a month a go and still havn't warn it .. I might end up throwing it away :/"
2.0,"the wallet is great i love the wallet, but the key chain sucks. Its made of carbon fiber but my keys fell off of the chain and now they are lost. But it is a beautiful key chain but my keys fell off."
2.0,"Nicely constructed.  Nice oversize except it is short, like a belly top short.  I'll wear it over a dress, but it is not nearly as long as the image shows."
2.0,"Its so straight cut that off you got wider hip area, it’s fits weird and gives awkward shape.  Material is not soft or stretchy and not breathable (was hot while I was trying out, can’t imagine wearing it in summer)<br />Not worth it"
2.0,"Ordered these pants as a ""buy it again"". I have several pair of these pants in all colors. These arrive and are a completely different fabric. Super frustrated as I love the others I have and these are more rayon than I like."
2.0,"This wallet is attractive, if poorly constructed. Within two weeks of use, i began to notice signs of deterioration. If you are looking for something remotely as durable as a genuine leather wallet, this is not an advisable purchase."
2.0,"The earrings don't seem to close properly. I can still wear them but, and they look great, but I'm afraid the clasp isn't very strong and they will probably fall off."
2.0,I had one of theses and loved it. I had many great comments on it from people. I was just wearing it one day and if fell off of my arm. One of the links had broken. I returned it to the supplier and they replaced it with another. Then the same thing happened with that one. I still have it. Did not bother returning it again.
2.0,they broke pretty quickly
2.0,The outfit is super cute. Extremely too big which is disappointing. I’m reordering it in a 6-12 months although my daughter wears a 2T. I previously ordered a 18-24 months but it definitely seems to fit more so of a 3t/4t. I’ll review the next purchase in hopes that it fits much better. The 18-24 month pants literally fall off-the crop top I didn’t even bother putting on her as it was too big when I placed it against her chest
2.0,"Most women purchase a skirted bathing suit because they are trying to cover up more.  This skirt is super low cut! Otherwise okay, but what mature women is looking for low cut in a skirted bottom?"
2.0,Nice dress but I ordered an xxl & recieved a small.
2.0,Could not get back off post...too delicate concerned would break too easy...going to return.  Did not meet my expectations.
2.0,The  grommet that holds the floral decoration on to the belt belt  fell apart in the packaging.  I would not recommend purchasing this item.
2.0,The picture was a pink heart design but the case that arrived was Betty Boop on a motorcycle.
2.0,"I have the original one that came with my Panerai Submersible and bought this one to use it in other watch but after two days couldn't keep it, the rubber is hard, it's really uncomfortable and looks cheap. I do not recommend it"
2.0,I really like this bracelet when it came.  I started wearing it immediately.  After a week the peace charm fell off.  I was very careful and was quite shocked that happened.
2.0,Such a cute design but ran small and quality isn't the best. I wore it once - not sure I'll be wearing it again. Sigh....
2.0,"While it was a very pretty set, it looked at felt like cheep costume jewelry. I feel like it's more appropriate for a child playing dress up than an adult wearing to an event which is is why I bought it and then returned it."
2.0,"The straps are SKINNY and hardly secured to the top. The top I bought was a size Large but fit like a size small (I'm a medium/large). It should have had plenty of room and I would have been fine if it were just tight, but not THAT tight."
2.0,"Did not look like picture. Did get dress very quick, got refund quivk as well!"
2.0,This is made of a very thin flimsy material.  My granddaughter is a small 7-yr old.  She could barely get these over her head.  She said it was very uncomfortable because it’s so tight.  I’m returning.
2.0,FABRIC VERY THIN
2.0,HInge doesn't work well
2.0,I liked the idea but somehow the size was wrong.
2.0,Very expensive and poorly made... fell apart within a week.
2.0,This dress is way too wide. I’m normally an XS but decided to give this dress a try in the S. I would have liked it to be more form fitting at the top & loose/flowy at the bottom but it has more of a box shape. The dress has a liner & the fabric seems nice but it’s way too heavy. The dress feels like your carrying around 5 lbs of extra weight. Unfortunately I returned it!
2.0,"My 5 year old has a medium size head and this was tight on him.  There wasn't much give in the size of the face cover to fit comfortably.  Otherwise, it was soft and seemed like it was made well but the flexibility in the function was lacking."
2.0,"I guess you get what you paid for... Necklace was tarnished and looking poor within a few days, and the chain is not sturdy."
2.0,The built-in cups were very weird and did not fit well. Bathing suit​ was cute but nothing special.
2.0,Had to return them they would not stay hookef
2.0,Very thin material and it's not a very soft material. Definitely see-through. I feel like I'll have to use it as a bathing suit cover-up.
2.0,They don’t look anything like the picture. Very skimpy and will probably be too small for the people I’m gifting them to.
2.0,I wear a 7.5 medium in women's the 7 ordered is to big.
2.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS SHOE.....It looks and feels great but expect it to tear or rip in about 3 months.  The metal shoe hooks rusts really fast and mesh one both sides rips like if it is dry rotten.  At first I taught it as good but after 3 months, I changed my mind"
2.0,Lense falls out often
2.0,I purchased 4 sweatshirts and they are not consistent in size. The sleeves are very baggy in the bicep area. I have a few old russel sweatshirts and they fit much better and are true to size.
2.0,This dress is super cute but way too tight in the chest area.  I put a came underneath and left the top four buttons undone.
2.0,Do not really help any that I can notice.
2.0,These were tiny and uncomfortable to put in and wear! I would only recommend if you have a TINY nose or if your piercing is literally at the very bottom/ tip of your nose. Loved the colors but they literally were so small they didn’t hang out of my nose .
2.0,Not really what I thought they were going to be
2.0,"I absolutely love this purse, i buy many and this became my regular immediately, but the inside zipper broke in the first week :( :("
2.0,It's cute to wear but the material is supper thin and rips easily.
2.0,Cheap product and much smaller than expected/advertised.
2.0,Style is so cute but the fit was funky. Definitely not an option for anyone with anything going on up top.
2.0,There comfortable but are very see thru. Not to wear to the gym or any place lol!
2.0,Broke after the second wear. The fit and material are nice though. I’m just bummed they didn’t last longer
2.0,Material is two thin for a long sleeve Polo not warm at all
2.0,Not genuine on any level. Very cheesy quality.
2.0,"Poorly made, especially for being marketed as a uniform or every day shoe. The seam at the back of the shoe split at the top after 3 months; we put duct tape on it. At 4 months the elastic holding the strap pulled off one shoe; shortly afterward the other shoe went the same way. My daughter is small for her age and not the most active child, fwiw."
2.0,Ordered a 14/16 for my daughter who is currently a 10/12 so it would fit for a while and it doesn’t even fit. This runs way too small. It’s a 7/8 truly.
2.0,"these digital watches are fun, i have given to my friends and family. they also are good in the dark when i cant see the clock time."
2.0,I ordered this bracelet to give as a gift. It's super cute & would've been perfect.  The first time the wrapped cord by the stone was frayed like it was finished improperly. The second time the same thing happened so I gave up & ordered from a different company.
2.0,"I am so disappointed in the fit.  I ordered a 9 so they would be very comfortable.  I usually wear an 8 or 8 1/2 but these are tight on my foot, lenth and width wise."
2.0,"The product description states the band fits the Samsung S3 Frontier.  However, it is a bit to large.  One of the pins on the strap was broken, but I was able to use the pin from another strap.  After about 30 mins, I was able to attach the strap.  However it took a lot of effort as the band is slightly too large for the watch.  For a Male, I don't have a large wrist however, I can only use the very last hole ... so the band won't work for guys with large wrists.  For the price, I made the band work however I change bands alot so this band isn't going to work all that well for me.  My other bands from Amazon have the quick release feature and can be changed in less than 3 minutes.  This band will take alot more time and effort when I want to change it."
2.0,i order 1 size larger but was too small and short
2.0,"My plastic insert tore apart so I ordered two of these, one as a backup. The windows are small and the plastic is thin. Sorry I ordered them but I'm not motivated enough to return them. Looking for a better quality insert."
2.0,Nice lightweight shirt but it fits oddly.  It's VERY long and the arms are even longer!  The cuffs on the sleeves are loose so you can't pull them up to your elbows and get them to stay.  It's a shirt I can't plan on doing anything like cooking or cleaning in.
2.0,"This “dress” shrunk, by 2 sizes, after the first washing and drying. So it’s now a shirt. :/"
2.0,"Yes it fits as expected, but the length is much shorter than pictured, not nearly as flattering. Disappointed in this top."
2.0,"Great case for the protection, good weight and really strong. However, you cannot fit your charger into the charger hole without some struggle and pressure. Feels like your charger or phone charger port will break when doing so. Do not buy unless you don't care about not charging your phone with the case taken off each time."
2.0,Pictures are so much prettier than in person. Very disappointed!
2.0,"Cute and works, but they are ichy and shed."
2.0,The product itself seems to be decent quality however I purchased them for a gift and the earrings came it a little plastic bag!! I know these aren’t from a fancy jeweler but come on?? A nice jewelry box can’t be too much to include!!
2.0,Really good concept but eye ortion of ring much too small.
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this package and it looks beautiful. However, the chain that came with was already broken. I was so sad as it was a gift for my boyfriend who was leaving to go to school. In my opinion it was too expensive for the chain to be so flimsy and receive it broken already. I am very disappointed"
2.0,NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS SHIRT WILL NEVER WEAR IT
2.0,"I have purchased several of these from different sellers. I have been pleased with most. This one has a decent fit & the length is perfect hitting right at top of my foot (I am 5""6). The weight of the fabric is nice & flowy not too thick & not too thin so it's not see through yet light enough to not be too hot. I would like a tad bit more room but that's just personal preference & not a garment flaw. The 2 issues with the dress is that this fabric is kind of shiny which was unexpected. I am not sure I like this. The second issue is the color the red is a deep red not a bright red which I actually like but the blue is more of a violet than a navy almost purple which I don't like. Haven't decided if I will keep the dress or not."
2.0,The actual colors make the wearer look like a clown.
2.0,Very see through and runs very big
2.0,Shoes were way too big and the shipping was ridiculous
2.0,Cute glasses! Necklace broke while taking it out of package. I realize it’s costume jewelry but expected at least one wear from it!
2.0,The material of this dress is odd - sort of like a swimsuit material. I would never wear this out somewhere as a dress. I ordered the red color and it is pretty. It fits as expected. I will keep this as a swimsuit cover-up.
2.0,"Zipper sticks, zips on female side, two FEMALE snaps at bottom closure."
2.0,"I already returned, looks ugly and cheap"
2.0,Top did not fit at all. Way to large. Not what I wanted.
2.0,they were smaller than I expected
2.0,They have such comfortable fabric but they slide down.  This is the size that I wear in other brand's but these are two big.  Totally bummed because I used up my limit on these and have to wait to buy more
2.0,The plastic that protects the sticky part of the bra would not come off the black bra in many places. Attempting to peel it off led to ripping off the sticky substance rendering the bra useless. I am not sure how to store the one bra I can actually use.
2.0,"No matter how tight I pinch cuff the earring falls off the top of my ear.  These are beautiful, I just wish I could wear them."
2.0,"Colors were pretty, but the bust was too large and slightly oddly shaped. Would likely fit someone with larger cup size than my C"
2.0,"It was gorgeous in the begging. My wife loved it. However, in a week or so it got dark((.. So.. Will buy no more."
2.0,Opal just looks clear. Very generic looking
2.0,Not as bright as it looks in the photo. That makes it hard to see what type of rock it is. It looks more black than the beautiful purple amethyst color.
2.0,"In reality, this vintage bracelet is not as great as the photo of it is. It is smaller & doesn't show the individuality of the strips very well as the don't stay in place as shown in the photo. But it was so cheap that I shouldn't have expected much. Pooqdo, through Amazon, provided the bracelet. My granddaughter seemed to like it, however."
2.0,The size is good. The IDEA 💡 was great but  it does not have a clean look. Looks a little bit crappy. No fence 😮‍💨
2.0,"Well. Not exactly what I was expecting, the material is thick, but soft. Kind of like already worn in sweats 🤷🏻‍♀️ It’s comfy. Seams on the shirt are WEIRD. It’s like a tshirt with sleeves sewn on. But the “long” sleeve is a different diameter than the shoulder part or the sleeve, so the arms are really tight and uncomfortable and the neck/chest is wider.<br />For reference I’m 5’2” and 198lbs with a big butt, the shorts are comfortable, high waisted and still long enough to not be booty shorts.<br />Definitely won’t be wearing it in public on vacation like Id planned but the shorts will be good pjs!"
2.0,This is a nice inflatable chair they give you the Small tube to blow up the chair is hard to get out of the chair for children and adults it's just HARD TO BLOW UP WITH A TINY BLOW UP TUBE NOT AIR PUMP BUT SOMETHING TO PRESS FOR HOURS IF YOU DONT HAVE A AIR PUMP. It's PRETTY TO LOOK AT BUT TO USE NOT WORTH IT. MY SON IS 5 AND HAD A HARD TIME GETTING UP it's NOT AS BIG ALSO.
2.0,"The band came undone constantly and then a month later it broke. I've only had the watch for three months and wore it a handful of times. Very disappointing, now I need a new bracelet."
2.0,"I will start by saying that I have a problem keeping my hands warm in the winter.  I bought these in preparation for a winter camping trip where the temperatures were in the singles digits (Fahrenheit).  While they were warmer that other gloves I have, my hands still got cold."
2.0,Very heavy and stiff.  Runs small.  Had to return
2.0,The material is very cheap and very thin
2.0,Pretty but if you have a larger chest runs small in that area.
2.0,Nothing to like too big to thick and rough
2.0,The neck line is too low.. the picture dies not seem to look that way. I will not be using them.
2.0,"First, this is a very pretty bag and was pleased with it when I opened the package.  However, after use, I have found the chain to be in the way when opening the bag.  Very awkward.  Also, after carrying it for a short time, one of the closing magnets does not catch.  Very disappointed as I was expecting to really love it."
2.0,"The material is super cheap & thin. I had hoped to wear this to a winter wedding, but I’d freeze my bum off for sure in this dress. Back to amazon it goes. The sizing seemed correct though if anybody wants to know, although the sleeves were pretty loose, not tight & fitted like they appear in the picture. I normally wear a size 2X/18-20 & I’m 5’9”, 230 lbs with a 38D bust size."
2.0,"Disappointed in the dress. Fabric was nice, but there was no stretch in the chest - even with my “a” cups!"
2.0,I returned this dress. It was extremely short and didn't fit well on the top. Way too cheap looking for the expensive price. I'm not sure I'd even want it for $9.99 but for $20 not worth it.
2.0,"The materials isn’t as pretty as it looks, I am most disappointed with the fact that it didn’t match the descriptions, no pockets!"
2.0,Beautiful glasses. Great price. Love the colors
2.0,The watch works great but the band did not last 2 years.
2.0,the printing wasn’t of great quality<br />i dont think this is licensed from MHA<br /><br />i wouldn’t repurchase
2.0,"The earrings are very pretty, but fell apart the first time I wore them."
2.0,I want to love this but the color is way off the description says red but it is like a orange coral color and my daughters party is in a week . Not to mention the bottom of the dress is already coming apart
2.0,"not red, it is orange.... false description."
2.0,me ha dejado mi oreja roja y fuera de eso los cristales no brillan como dicen OSEA../
2.0,Very small and I ordered the largest size.
2.0,"Stitching on sleeves and hem started to unravel right away. I wash all my stuff cold, gentle but this is too delicate even for that. Luckily I have a sewing machine and could fix all the loose seams before the shirt was ruined."
2.0,This hat is too small. Hurts my ears and head and it has an adjustable thing on it but it's as loose as it gets and I can BARELY get it on my head. I would return but it's been too long now.<br />Also the way it's sewn is weird.. it doesn't lay flat anywhere...
2.0,"Love the dress! It’s really beautiful just as pictured, however the top is super tight. I ordered the plus size, I’m 5’3 36 D I usually wear a Large or size 12 in dresses. This dress had a very strange cut to the arm holes and was too tight across my chest ( under the ruffle). Since I could not send it back and I sew, I made a little modification to the top since there is so much fabric."
2.0,Adorable but hard to get on the key and then on a key ring.
2.0,"Would not buy this again. Didn’t fit well, too thin, not good for any temps under 60 degrees Fahrenheit."
2.0,Whenever i raise my arms my chest pops out. I'm not sure if I smaller top would have stopped this but the bottoms were already almost too small. I am able to use the bottoms though and just use a different top with them.
2.0,I believe this was made for the people of Innsmouth. The eyes are way off.
2.0,Not what I  thought. It was a double wrap waaayyy to long and it smelled. You know that leather mothball smell but cheap leather has when it's been sitting in a warehouse so it's been soaking in water and soap hopefully I can get it to smell just like leather instead of mothballs and dead animal
2.0,"I liked the color of the leather, but it is insanely bulky to wear! more so than any other nato style leather strap I've ever purchased. but hey for the money I guess I can't complain that much"
2.0,Beautiful dress however they are cut extremely big. No where near true to size. I order 2. One for my teen and one for myself for a wedding that we was in. Delivery was extremely slow. Made it just in time for the wedding. We had to tie an extender to the hanger straps and tie the straps together to hold the dresses up since they were so big. If you are ordering down size your order.
2.0,"driving, walking in mornings"
2.0,This suit was a nice print and good material. The style was very flattering and I loved the way it looked but the swim suit underneath was so tight around the thighs/bikini area it literally hurt to wear. I have never had a swim dress do that. No matter how much I liked the look of the suit it was way too uncomfortable to wear or keep.
2.0,"The product is cheaply made, and while the ad claims it's made of wood and leather, it did not appear so to me. The motor was very quiet until it wasn't (32 days).  It then started making a loud  humming noise and quit rotating. Amazon allowed for its return and I am shopping for a higher quality winder. You get what you pay for with this one."
2.0,The dress is supposed to tie in the front. Doesn’t even close. The material is cheap. I thought it would be like a maxi dress. Definitely not.
2.0,"The tie's pattern is exactly as shown. Unfortunately, instead of the predominant dark red background, the tie I received is almost  a light pink, making it unfit to wear with the clothes I have."
2.0,"These underwear were so disappointing.<br /><br />I am not sure who these underwear were made for.  The front and back of these boxer briefs are very bizarrely designed.  The best way to describe it is that they are flat.  There is no room made for anything.  I put on these underwear and it felt like I was trying to squeeze into something at least two sizes too small.  They were very restricting and not comfortable at all.  Very stiff and having poor range of motion.  I checked the sizing and they were stated as one thing and feel very different to what they should be.  I am hoping I just received a faulty sized product because otherwise, whatever size you normally are, you will need to order two sizes larger for them to begin to fit.<br /><br />I would not recommend these underwear."
2.0,These masks ate extremely hard to breathe thru
2.0,"I thought this was going to be a nice scarf.  I was wrong.  The fabric is cheap and the pattern, in person, is just ugly.  I'll give it a chance with a couple of different outfits---it may end up surprising me.  Overall though, not a good purchase."
2.0,The fabric is too thin.  I bought the white dress and you can pretty much see right through it.  They also run small.  I returned mine.
2.0,"The necklace, the bracelet and the hoop earrings are really cute.  But the other earrings are made of a felt like fabric and don’t seem very durable."
2.0,I started using this case a few days back. The case seems well made and provides me with enough protection for my glasses.<br /><br />Updated on March 03 2017.<br /><br />The case spring gave up in 4 months of use.
2.0,"These were really thin material and there is no ""stretch."" Only closure is a drawstring which is a pain in my opinion."
2.0,"was way too small, I wear a size 12 and it was inches from clipping with the LG/XLG... so bummed. also the fringe is a lot less full than the picture too."
2.0,It got holes in the top by the wires quick.
2.0,The material is slick and shiny like a bad pair of pajamas.
2.0,"I debated on purchasing this dress for weeks. It has an adorable pattern and I love  the fact that it is soft and so comfortable. However, the pictures show the dress background as white (for the white dress with blue floral patterns) but it is more of white or even a cream. Kinda yellowish, not &#34;white&#34; at all. The dress is a little on the larger side. All the reviews said to order up, but I ordered my normal size and it's a bit big. Also, this dress is almost totally see through. Not worth the money."
2.0,I thought these would be cute but they really just feel like granny panties.
2.0,Too yellowish and doesn't work well enough.
2.0,"This was tight fitting across the chest though I went by the measurements.  And, the bottoms were for long legged ladies. Cute but... disappointed with my purchase."
2.0,The fabric feels quite cheap. Pretty disappointed.
2.0,itchy.
2.0,"NOT COTTON BLEND AS ADVERTISED.  BOO!! It is 100% polyester.  I prefer my dresses to breathe.  It's a cute feminine cut, shame I will be smelling like a man after an hour."
2.0,"I got a size larger than I normally wear so I could wear pants underneath, they were so tight I couldn't even get them on without pants."
2.0,Could be a nice shirt if it wasn’t so damn SMALL!
2.0,Comfy but super disappointed. Got them for Christmas. Wore them for a whole day traveling. By the time I got to my destination the in soles had completely slid out of place and crinkled up and glue was all over the bottom. It was so annoying that before heading into Disney I ran to Walmart and grabbed replacement shoes because I didn’t want to be uncomfortable all day. Such a number because they are super cute!
2.0,"I agree with the other reviews, the back buckle is too much. It just makes the belt look bulky & unattractive. Don't waste your money!"
2.0,"The shirt I received was the right size but it was not what I ordered.  The shirt I ordered was a light bluish gray with white embroidery. The shirt I received was a shiny gray with bright, multicolored mexican style embroidery.  I didn't return it because I might wear it, but I really would have liked to get the shirt in the picture."
2.0,The nose piece was not the right one for my M frames
2.0,"I bought a 2T for my 1 year old granddaughter and based on the other reviews saint the sizes ran small, I bought an XL for my daughter in law. The 2T fix more like a 12 mth and the XL was more like a med. The quality is nice, and they are very cute, just way too small on our American frames."
2.0,This is another dress I ordered for my mom for Christmas it didn't fit her at all it end up fitting myself. It was wrong size again so I am wondering it looks like if you don't have the right fit you just give anything to customers. I was not going to send it back because I was not going to try going through the process of return in the holiday rush. But I will try again to order another dress and hopefully I get the right size.
2.0,The hoodie was supposed to be size 2x in mens it did not even come close to fitting my husband who i bought it for and he can usually fit xl so i got 2x to be safe. Not great quality either
2.0,these socks are the same ....I ordered 2 different kind they are the same ..and no what described
2.0,"The fit is great but the colors of the dress I received were not even close to the colors of the actual dress. It’s cute and I’ll wear it, but not as often as I was disappointed. The actual colors are not great for my skin tone."
2.0,The ties are too short. Does not fit comfortably
2.0,Print is stiff. Doesn't sit right
2.0,One time wore it and the 3 crystals fell out.
2.0,Much bigger than I thought I got a medium but should have got a small. Always hard to gage size on these sites
2.0,"The material is stiff and the fit is short. Something is not right with how the sweater is made, It feel uncomfortable."
2.0,"Very cheaply made, collar area is literally held together by stitching. One and done wear if you go there."
2.0,Smaller than expected. Had to ship back twice. Normally wear a Medium had to get an extra large
2.0,WATCH OUT!!!!  This shirt is WAAAAAY small!!!  I wear a large and ordered XL just in case.....I sold it to a co-worker who wears a small!!!!
2.0,"description was not ideal,  could not fit my racquet in the spot for the racquet, one of the zippers was broken"
2.0,These are pretty to look at. They fit well. They do the job an apron needs to do - keep my clothes clean and dry while I work in the kitchen. They wash fine and don’t shrink too much. But the material is extremely thin (although durable) and the texture is roughish and crunchy.
2.0,Item was a little tight
2.0,its only 18pc kit not 36
2.0,Runs way to small. And to thin
2.0,Order sizes up description should say run small
2.0,"Hardly fit over shin pads, too tight"
2.0,Tight on wrong areas
2.0,Legit the worst medal ever had it on for 2 days after I've had my belly pierced for 4 years now and it still managed to get infected on top of that the little ball would come off and eventually I ended up loosing it
2.0,I LOVED the appeal but the rigidness immediately made my piercing red and uncomfortable. I felt I was on the verge of infection so I tossed them both. Sad. Cool look.
2.0,"Poor quality, and very flimsy. It was packed with another product of mine and was smashed a bit. I can't get it back to its original shape."
2.0,"THe fabric did not stretch unlike most fleece. Without that , it will most likely not fit because it is not stretchy. The sizing is a bit small. Disappointing for cute pants style design though."
2.0,"Didn't like the fabric.  It was just too thin and every curve, etc. of your body shows.  Maybe good for younger women but not a 75 year old. Sent back."
2.0,somewhat awkwardly sewn and a little different than the picture. there arent bows and the fabric seems cheaper. it's still cute but not as well fitting as i wanted it to be.
2.0,"What are the pills that happen on this leotard?!  My daughter loves this, I just wish it lasted longer than 2 months!"
2.0,"Hat with plastic. Nice in theory but the plastic was not the same that you would get on a face shield. It's a soft plastic more like what would be in a roll.  Plastic was wavy. Not sure what we will use them for but we will probably find something, or just have 2 hats."
2.0,Fit poorly. It also had a frumpy shape that was very unflattering.
2.0,This is for children. So very small.
2.0,Not good. Very poor quality. Don't bother
2.0,I lost the ball in one day... isn't very sturdy.
2.0,Too small. Order at least a full size bigger
2.0,I bought these a month and a half ago and 2 out of the 3 already broke randomly. I never took them off or adjusted the size. Kind of a bummer because I actually liked them.
2.0,I really loved the style. The material wasn't as I expected it to be. I still like it. Just thought it would fit differently than it does.
2.0,The first time I ordered these I loved them. Good size and quite secure with all my earrings. Unfortunately I lost one.  This second time the disks were bigger. Didn’t like that as much snd they weren’t as secure. More like any other you can buy anywhere that look the same.  These did not have the tightness and secure feeling of my first purchase. Don’t know if a fluke but disappointing nonetheless.  Just on a trip and one of them just fell apart. Disk cams away and now I’m not sure if I should try ordering again or not.  The first pair I’d give a 5 star but not this one.
2.0,"Be aware these ship from overseas, and you won't see them for about 2 months.  While the gloves are very well made, and have many nice features, they run extremely small.  The XXL Men's glove I ordered for my son will not even fit my hand, and I usually wear a women's small glove. I was able to gift them to a friend, but was disappointed with the sizing and the long transit time."
2.0,I thought I found a pair of work slacks but they were leggings. Not what I was expecting
2.0,Orderer 2x  and still to small for me but am giving as gift to oldest daughter .
2.0,The sleeves were 10 inches too short
2.0,My kiddo wears a size 5 youth and the 5 in these looked more like a size 7 women's.  Straight back they went.
2.0,It’s made well and it held good for about 2 weeks and now i have to keep  tightening it .  I thought the metal prongs would hold better but it’s not .
2.0,wore for a half-hour after washed my hair. Not working as expected
2.0,I love the look of the bathing suit. I've received lots of compliments on how cute it is. Unfortunately the construction is not done well. Several seams have come undone even though the bathing suit fits well. I have worn it 10 times and it seems it is falling apart.
2.0,The middle strap broke after two months of wearing them only occasionally. Waste of money.
2.0,Looks very cheap.... I should have bought a Qualo.
2.0,Not work
2.0,will not fit a size 0 its made for sizes 2-4
2.0,Sleeves are too tight. Had to return.
2.0,One earring broke/crumbled getting it out of the pkg. Feels like unfired clay product...very fragile!
2.0,"I bought this wallet and started using it at the beginning of July. By September, the material the wallet is made of started flaking off. The ad says the wallet is leather, but how would it flake off like this if it was really leather? I love the wallet, the design of it and the fact that I could use just the wallet to carry around if I didn't want to carry my purse. I even bought a similar one for my mother before I realized that it was a piece of junk. Another disappointing purchase."
2.0,At first I bought an xl since I followed the size chart. It is way too large so I returned it and got my actual size medium. I am 5 8” 165 lbs. I wear it all day all week long. Great quality !
2.0,They red around the symbol...just fell out of one...hadn't even worn it yet. Super dissatisfied.
2.0,To hard hand and uncomfortable to wear them all day
2.0,"[[ASIN:B01DVZ4PII Vero Monte 4 Pairs Mens Elastic No Show Socks (Size 6-8, Black & Grey)]] I bought this product and stomper joe to compare because i've been searching for a no show socks. Unfortunately, this product has a tendency to slip out from the heel while you are walking. It's like you're wearing a  half socks with uncomfortable feeling under your feet."
2.0,"Wrong color, not the standard laces that come with issue boots, but they seem pretty durable for what it's worth."
2.0,"The shirt was fine in size and material but the logo came messed up (it was crinkled in some spots like it wasnt laid flat) and the shorts were very small but also of good material.<br /><br />So I give it those points purely for material and shirt size. I usually wear a L or XL, i bought a 2XL and the shorts were still too small."
2.0,My competitive gymnasts did not approve had to return. Too thin and cheap. Rolled under Grips and not sufficient.
2.0,"The picture is of a three strand bracelet, with a reflection that at first glance looks like 4 strands. I received a two strand bracelet. Giving as a gift, so felt no choice but to keep, but it is just okay. Feels a bit like bait and switch. Arrived promptly, and well packaged.<br />Update: I've reconsidered and will be returning this item."
2.0,Happy with it till chain came apart
2.0,Great bifocal sunglasses! Good price!
2.0,Its super cute but everytime i bend over it wants to flip upside down. I have 2 keep fixing it.
2.0,The advertisement stated loose fitting pants but they are anything but loose fitting.
2.0,Toe edges are not finished so they unravel & get caught. Plan to return them.
2.0,"Way too small! I bought one sized bigger than normal and it barely went up past my hip - even unzipped. If it would have fit, I would have kept it. The material was wonderful."
2.0,This dress was way too big
2.0,The sunglasses broke 2 weeks after I received them. The screws on the front of the glasses doesn't appear to fit properly in the plastic lens.
2.0,The dimensions on this are not accurately reflected in the photo. The heart is much bigger and doesn't come close to fitting in the cutout from the larger circle part.
2.0,Came with one zircon missing.......
2.0,They keep the feet warm but one pair tore a little near the toe after 2 weeks of use.<br />I'd prefer better quality from a sock that is worn everyday.<br />They are soft and comfortable otherwise.
2.0,"I loved this purse. I've had it for almost a year but today when I was leaving the store, the strap broke on me. I'd hoped a leather bag would last me multiple years! Mine made it 11 months!"
2.0,"Fits everywhere nicely and is super soft, but the waist band can definitely be a little snug if you don't have a flat stomach."
2.0,The Velcro is badly frayed. I imagine that if these were machine washed they would fall apart. Returning after having less than a week.
2.0,"It’s very pretty like the picture, but sadly runs very small. Returning it because I literally can’t even pull it down over my boobs! I’m 5’4” and 170 lbs and 2 months post-pregnancy. About 38C bra."
2.0,"It's a really good looking watch, but the one I got was faulty.  The hand for the day of the week got stuck, and the second hand stopped working.  I thought about buying it again, but I'm just going to go for another brand instead..."
2.0,disappointed in how cheap the item was made
2.0,zipper broken
2.0,Big.....too big
2.0,"Ordered these thinking they'd fit my 3 year olds face, no dice. I had to return them, but I did think they were pretty well made."
2.0,The dress is jersey knit and tight.  I order a size larger and it still doesn't fit well.  Edging is rough and not tailored. The fabric is thin and cheap-looking.  I'm giving the dress away.
2.0,Disappointed.  Thought it was a snap closure.  Will choose differently next time.
2.0,"It was ok. I ordered one and returned it because the lace on the top was all messed. I ordered another one, recieved it and the top still didnt sit right as well as the clips that are on the straps are flimsy and unhook very easily. I wanted to like this dress cause I thought it was cute but just wasnt made well. I returned it, wouldn't recommend it."
2.0,These were not what I was expecting. I wanted it to be flat on top but theres a curve to it.
2.0,Strings holding it together brake to easy only last a week of wear
2.0,"Colors are good and it's double-layered but there were no nose wires, despite that claim in the title!"
2.0,Love the look but the chain broke on the second day.
2.0,Does not look like pictured
2.0,Looks more like brown than black tights ove skin.  I do not recommend
2.0,Too small.....
2.0,"Super cute top, but runs short. I’m 5’4 and this was a crop top on me, even with high waisted jeans. I love a good crop top, but I wanted to be able to wear this as a regular shirt. Returning :("
2.0,"Wanted to love this dress but recieved a dress with make up on it, a oil spot on it and the tag cut out of the dress. 🤦🏽‍♀️"
2.0,These socks were very soft. I always wash new clothing pryor to wearing. I found it odd that it took these socks three trips through the dryer to dry. They absorb water exactly like cotton and take forever to dry. Most of my socks are wool so I try my clothes on a low heat setting. My wool socks were dry on the first trip through the dryer. I left all the clothes in and ran the dryer one more time. I was shocked to find that everything was dry except for these bamboo socks. These sucks definitely do NOT have the wicking and drying properties that wool socks have. Wool also has antimicrobial and anti-bacterial properties so they don't build up bacteria and therefore do not smell. I can't speak for these socks as I have not worn them. But I cannot imagine bacteria not loving to grow in a moisture holding sock like this.
2.0,"Nice soft fabric, but they are cut small."
2.0,Item has a nice bling shine to it but necklace and bracelet feels costume jewelry and light. Also was not long enough until adding the bracelet. Return because in my opinion this couldn't pass to be real.
2.0,Its not for men. Looks for women.
2.0,The quality just isn’t there. These aren’t as nice as expected. Very thin.
2.0,The bra seem to fit uneven. No way to adjust. Wanted to return but it would cost shipping. Not worth it. I will donate
2.0,I bought these in 9 - 2019.  I got the XL size.  They were too small and did not look like great quality to me.  I had no problem returning them.  So if you want to try them for yourself do not worry about returning them... as long as you do not wash or wear them (just try them on).
2.0,The pant legs are more like shorts
2.0,It was smaller than I had expected.  You can hardly see the writing.
2.0,Too small and I ordered a size up.
2.0,A very thin comfortable sock. I was looking for something with cushion.
2.0,Looked kind of cheap looking in person.
2.0,"XL for girls was more like a size 4/5 instead of 7/8 as listed.<br />There were strings hanging off of the dress.  Giving 2 stars, if it was correct sizing, it would be a pretty dress. Very vibrant colors."
2.0,"It looks way cheaper in person than in the pictures - the gold chain links are too big and it’s not as long as pictured. Also, mine came with what looks like dark fingerprints on the gold pieces. Weird. I’ll probably wear it at some point, but definitely disappointed."
2.0,They straps don’t lay correctly
2.0,"So, I've only had this a couple of days....using it as a stand in wedding ring while mine is currently too small for my chubby fingers....BUT the stone has already popped out. COMPLETELY. So, I guess lesson learned. I will not be buying again. Which is a bummer, because this is a gorgeous ring."
2.0,We were looking forward to using these.  We wear hearing aids and masks with ear loops get tangled with the device and can pull them out.  I can use this product although it is very tight going over my head.  My husband cannot use it at all because it is very tight with very little stretch.
2.0,"Super cute, but the rinestones were hanging off of them. I don’t know how to fix because I don’t want glue getting on the lenses so I think they’re just cute trash..."
2.0,The dress is cute but very cheaply made and sheer. It looks like it would fall apart after being worn. I am returning it.
2.0,Not a good fit but pretty shirt
2.0,Runs so small I thought I was going to have to cut it off myself. Literally could not breathe. Super cute skirt though!
2.0,"Earrings were half the size I expected them to be. It's the right design, but much too small to be worn comfortably in ear lobes."
2.0,"This dress looked just as beautiful in person as it does online, the only problem I had was the size. I ordered a small and it was still way too big. They do not offer an extra small and I therefore had to return the dress. Would recommend this to those who can fit into the sizes offered. Very cute!!"
2.0,These boots are very cute and wear nicely. The first time I wore them a scuff was on the toe. It took the leather off and brown. I have no idea how that happened. I only had them on for less than an hour. Very disappointed
2.0,You have to order big size to look like in the picture
2.0,"Won't be buying from this company again. After less than a month of wear, it has developed a ""worn"" look with pilling on the arms and front."
2.0,Fits small waist. Not very high quality material
2.0,some things I ordered did not fit to size
2.0,Seems to be very see through. Also the first opening doesn’t fit around my face so I can’t even put it in. Very disappointed.
2.0,Shrinks when washed
2.0,One strap was broken onone bra. Pretty disappointed in that but they are pretty inexpensive. Love the look. Fit well. Unfortunately I’ll have to send back and will probably reorder some where else.
2.0,"I was hoping this dress would look nice on my tall, Pear-shaped body. But it was too frumpy with all of the extra fabric and made my lower body look huge/funny in comparison to my tiny waist."
2.0,The sports bra does have a medium support fit in the chest area however the band on the bottom is loose and does not stay flat against my rib cage.  I ordered a medium and I wear a 32 D
2.0,"The dress is cute, but it’s majorly see-through. Thank God I looked in the mirror before leaving for work (I’m a middle school teacher!) and noticed that I could see my nude colored bra through it!"
2.0,"I really like these pants. First time wearing I saw they had a hole. Next time you send out a product, make sure there is nothing seeing with it!!!!"
2.0,They were too confining and tight. For smaller children.
2.0,"Cheap fabric, boxy cut"
2.0,"It's good specifically for role play, I guess I was dumb and was hoping it would be some kind of useful scarf."
2.0,"I'm 5'8"" , 150 lbs....This top is very cute,but is TAN not Apricot ! I ordered XL, fits like a Small....stretchy but very tight..<br />Buyer beware of color & size!"
2.0,Totally dissatisfied with Red Wing Boots due to poor sizing & marginal quality. Sent the boots back along with Red Wing accessories (Mink Oil & Brush).
2.0,My mom got this and it seemed to be 2 sizes too small. She was pretty disappointed.
2.0,This bootie fits so weird. Its super narrow and turned up in the toe area. Thumbs down for me.
2.0,It's unfortunately to heavy and to big to wear. But on upside it looks really cool and I can carry it around as a lucky charm and find a smaller necklace
2.0,"Had no support, very cute to wear under dresses but if you are expecting control and support then this is not the SPANX for you."
2.0,"These bras are cute, but the support is minimal for larger breasts. They do wash/wear well."
2.0,"Order 2 sizes bigger if you don't want it skin tight all over, especially if you are curvy. Very thin and if you are busty it exposes a lot more than some would like."
2.0,v was WAY TOO DEEP
2.0,Lost coin and Beads first time I wore it.
2.0,"These pants fit my toddler well.<br />For the price I thought they were a good deal. However, after first wash (straight from the bag it came in) it began unthreading/unravelling at the ankles and waist.<br /><br />If this didn’t happen then it would have indeed been a good deal. I didn’t buy a BRAND NEW pants to sew and reinforce the sewn sections.<br /><br />I would therefore not recommend this item to others unless they have intention to take needle and thread and stitch as maybe necessary even BEFORE the first wear."
2.0,"Not the material I wanted, It is very pretty. I wear it around the house."
2.0,Shirt is lightweight and pretty basic.  A couple of threads hanging here and there.  The biggest issue is that the 3XL ordered is closer to an actual XL size.
2.0,Poor structure.  Ordered a size smaller than normal in an exchange.  No foot support.  Have to be careful when walking not to walk out of them
2.0,"I bought several (really, every color/pattern that came in my size) of these dresses a couple of years ago on a lightning deal and liked them, although even then I noticed inconsistencies in the fabric. The striped dresses I ordered (different colors, but all with white stripes) felt like a lighter and stretchier fabric than the solid colors I ordered. But all the solids I ordered were darker, winter-appropriate colors, so I was okay with the weight of the fabric being heavier. They were all supposed to be polyester/spandex blends, but the solids felt like they could've had some cotton in them, and the white-striped ones felt like they could've been a rayon/spandex blend. I wouldn't have thought they had polyester in them. Over the past couple of years, I've bought more striped ones and noticed that most were not as stretchy as the original striped ones I bought; they all felt like the heavier solid ones I bought originally.<br /><br />Fast forward to last week, I got a lightning deal notification and saw they had new solid and striped colors, so I ordered a few more. Most of the stripes I got were the heavier cotton-ish blend feel, except for the orange/white stripe which felt more like a rayon-ish blend like the original white-striped dresses I bought (this is great bc the orange is bright and I'd want to wear in the spring).<br /><br />But the solid colors were a HUGE disappointment. I was so excited about the new dark blue, pure green, and pure rose colors, but the fabric is awful. This fabric really does feel like cheap, slippery polyester. And the fabric is shiny too. I didn't even try them on since I know I would never wear material like that. I really hope they go back to the material used previously, but keep these new colors. My 2 star rating is really just for the new solid colored, disgusting polyester-feeling dresses."
2.0,This fabric has the worst smell I ever experienced. I loved the colour but going to return it because of the smell that is not going away. It smells of chemicals/dyes I guess and is so strong that you can always smell it while wearing it.
2.0,Not what I was looking for. Not absorbent at all.  I gave them away.
2.0,"Other socks ordered fit fine but your owl socks were too small, unfortunately. They were listed like the dog and others that fit fine"
2.0,"My son loves it. The black paint came off really quick though, and now it is silver. It started chipping within a week of receiving."
2.0,the short look great but the first time i put the on the right side back pocket rip open
2.0,They discolored fast. Not a good buy.
2.0,I needed a laundry bag for camp and stupidly chose this so I can get a different color for each of my twins. It was over $10 each bag. The material isn’t stretchy like my other laundry bag so it isn’t accommodating the expansive amount of laundry. Their luggage was only $30 each so this seems like a high price for a small bag.
2.0,"The TWO pairs I got fit fine. But they only sent 2 pairs, and left one out that was supposed to be included. So I am not very satisfied with this purchase. Can't guarantee you'll get what you ordered!"
2.0,This item breaks really really really easily
2.0,"The bra is great quality material but that’s about the only protocol I have to say about it. I wear medium in sports bras and even checked the sizing guide, which indicated 34C (my bra size) should get a medium. I was sweating by the time I finally got it on. WAY too tight. I say this understanding that sports bras should be a little snug, but this is too much. Also, as you can see from the pic, the pad inserts are weirdly lumpy and look awkward AF. Wouldn’t recommend unless you size up and feel comfortable taking out the inserts.<br /><br />Don’t believe the seller when they claim they will give you a $25 gift card for reviewing. They are lying! Would not recommend this product or company."
2.0,"I ordered an large. The shirt is somewhat tight around the underarms. Apparently these run small. Nice shirt overall, breathable."
2.0,"The foot portion as well as calf area were thin adult size. However, the over the knee part was about equal to the calf, which on me meant ugly! Ladies if you know your body, i.e. thin thighs, this is a great product, otherwise not-so-much."
2.0,it very beautifal but fit too small.
2.0,Cheaply made. It can't really tell by pic.
2.0,"The gloves themselves are of adequate quality for the price, but the touch screen doesn't really work on the three pairs I have tried so far."
2.0,Not really what I expected. Looks cheap and the headband isn't attached.
2.0,2/4 of the camis the straps broke the first time I wore them.  I am having to sew them back and strengthen the other two - these are poorly made but otherwise what you would expect for the price - if you don't have a sewing machine they are kind of like one time wear disposable camis
2.0,I bought this cause I though it would be cute for St Pattys day. When I got it it didn't look as cute as in the picture.
2.0,"Pros: Nice color,<br />Cons: Dress not as good as shown on the pick, Would not buy again"
2.0,"WRONG SIZE TWICE! I am a little irritated as this was a gift for a friend. I ordered a medium and was sent a large, so I did a return in order to get the correct size. I received the wrong size AGAIN. I am disappointed as these PJs are so cute and soft. I would give these 5/5 stars if I would have received the right size on even the second time. Very disappointed."
2.0,These are cute but cheap material
2.0,ITS DAMN NEAR SHEAR!!!  Wear a slip with it!
2.0,"It arrived two months later than I was told, and it did not take long for the stone to fall out as it was only held together by a tiny bit of glue. Very disappointed, never got to wear it."
2.0,I Ordered 1x size larger than I wear but still small. Did like the looks of the sweater and material. Just really off on the sizing. Returned!
2.0,Cute but the lenses popped out and the seller asked me to send pictures before even discussing the defect in product. I didn't feel like dealing with that so I just kept them..
2.0,poor quality material and very small!
2.0,"Did receive a refund , yes but it is plated  only"
2.0,"Absolutely beautiful beading but it's glued onto a cheap ribbon. The ribbon was too slick to stay tied so I had to bobby pin it. Then after an hour or so, the beaded section started coming unglued and was hanging off my dress."
2.0,It looks amazing but the XL is way too small.  If the sizing was correct I'd give this 5 stars.
2.0,"There are cute shorts, but they are at least one full size to small.  Quality of WalMart brand shorts, so just buy at Wal Mart so you can return it you need to."
2.0,Watch works fine but the band broke. 😔
2.0,"Watch is basic quality. The strap holder is real loose, and the strap pops out."
2.0,"The fit of these is off, they are way too small and every time you bend over they come down in the back.  Not good at all! I wear a size 3 to 5 normally and I ordered a large in these and they barely fit."
2.0,Good quality but runs small.  Purchased for my 12 year old (size 14-16)  but fits my 8 year old (size 8-10).
2.0,Didn’t last a month to be completely honest
2.0,"Length wise these sandals fit as expected, but if you have skinny feet the straps are too lose."
2.0,a spring was dislocated when it arrived. frame was too much in the way of my light glasses. don't know what type of glasses frames it would be good on.
2.0,"Pretty earrings. Smaller than expected but everything was in place, not broken or anything. My problem was with customer service. Had they been nice I would have given these 5 stars."
2.0,"15 months postpartum from baby #2 and I finally pulled the trigger. Everyone for YEARS talked about how amazing and perfect the mother tucker was. I thought I could use it as added support while working out and throughout the day to remind myself to engage my core, etc.<br /><br />BB raves about no rolling and pinching, no back fat. Well, they also don’t give you any choice on torso length. Mine is so long, that it doesn’t consider the fact that my hips and butt cause it to bend and fold and roll up. I have no back fat at the bra line, but now I have multiple waves of corset bulge (not fat) that without the mother tucker, doesn’t exist. (I added photos of my torso with it on and with it off for reference).<br /><br />I thought for $90 it would be more supportive, more tight, more slimming.<br /><br />I wear it because I spent $90, but after 4 years of hesitating and finally pulling the trigger after all the fuss and buzz and excitement, I’m overall pretty disappointed.<br /><br />I would not recommend."
2.0,"There are certainly some design aspects I’d change about this if I could. The arms that go around your ears are pretty weirdly shaped, and made of thick material so it hurts with the headset being on top of the ears. The other thing I would change is not to have them be “foggles”, but instead “blackout glasses”. The sun still comes through the fogged part and by some miracle I haven’t gone blind yet, it’s so bright.<br /><br />Otherwise, they’re cheap (great for student pilots lol), and they do the job. I just hate wearing them."
2.0,The candy canes were not clear as in the picture. Looks like a film is on it.
2.0,"Though I give this product high marks for value, the glasses themselves don’t open all the way. Very cheaply made. It was a cool addition to the party favor bags I wouldn’t purchase these again"
2.0,Bought them for my wife and after about 2x wearing them the crotch started to rip
2.0,"They’re see thru, very thin material…"
2.0,The charm is fading already
2.0,I wish I ordered 2 sizes up
2.0,"The shirt was a scratchy cotton material that shrank a ton when washed, so I wasn't too excited about it in general.  However, as I was first taking it out of the packaging I noticed a small hole in the back of the shirt.  There was even a small sticker next to it, like a quality control check that slipped through the cracks.  The hole in the shirt and the scratchy fabric are the reason for the low rating.  The printing looked great though."
2.0,This was very odd shaped and had a rip in it.
2.0,"I purchased a smaller size after reading the reviews and it's still too large? I put it away and totally missed the return deadline. The 2 stars for the color and the material but don't think I'll wear this in public.. If you're pondering about the size, order 1 or 2 sizes smaller.."
2.0,"Standing in these shoes for 12 hours hurts my feet so it's not so comfortable. But they fit well and look really nice. I'll see if an insert helps.<br /><br />Update: inserts do not help much. This shoe mainly looks good and protects your toes. If you're standing in these for a few hours a day, it'll hurt your feet."
2.0,"My order details say I asked for a Medium. The bag that the 3 shirts are in, has a sticker that says all shirts are Medium. Yet, the actual shirts are USA size Small and Eruopean size medium. Someone fell asleep at the job."
2.0,"I don’t know if it is just the color I got, but they are completely see through when I bend over. They are super cute, and really comfortable tho!"
2.0,Flared out awkwardly at hips and straps on sleeves dangle in a distracting way.
2.0,I bought this for work but the very second it fell out of the package wrapping I knew it was only suitable as a swimsuit coverup. Extremely see thru fabric. It’s pretty but flimsy.
2.0,"It looked nothing like pic..the ribbon ties under the breast n was useless, dress to tight,lace was uncomfortable, see thru and not flattering at all...don't reccomend"
2.0,They were nice and soft but after one wash they're no longer.
2.0,When it arrived the chain was broken. Very disappointed!!<br />Beautiful stone but it's  more like painted glass .
2.0,"I normally wear 2xl so I order the 3xl so I could wear clothes underneath . Well when I put in the hooded top (XXXL) It felt like a XL ,it was extremely tight in the chest and shoulder areas. However I will continue to wear it when I walk or cardio workouts<br /> . So if you are a big tall person the 3XL might be too small for you  I am only 5'11"" 230  Good luck"
2.0,"The jacket was not long enough for my son who is 6'9"" tall."
2.0,"Note - I received this backpack free of charge for review.<br /><br />After awhile in the Great Outdoors, I've come to the reluctant conclusion that, alas, you generally get what you pay for.  I mean, there are some bargains/values to be had, but shortcuts are rare and quality tends to come with a price.<br /><br />This pack is no exception.<br /><br />The first thing to know here is that while this is a large sustainment ruck, it has no frame to it.  Well, that's not strictly accurate...there is a &#34;frame,&#34; in the form of a somewhat stiff plastic sheet, but that's only enough to give the ruck some form to it.  It will NOT support a load on its own.  In fact, when shipped to me the pack was folded up, so the plastic sheet isn't even all that stiff.  In other words, the weight of the loaded ruck is going to be framed by your body, not any internal frame.<br /><br />As for the pack itself well, it's like this.  Porsche makes a very nice 911 with a turbo, but they also make a &#34;turbo-look&#34; 911.  That's a 911 with the spoiler and the other cosmetic cues, pretty much everything without the actual turbocharger.  That's kind of where I am with this ruck.  I mean, it LOOKS nice.  It LOOKS like business.  But for actual use, well, this ends up being a glorified day pack.  There is no hydration reservoir pocket (the interior pocket, such as it is, is designed to carry a laptop per the ad copy...something you aren't likely to take with you in the backcountry....), contrary to current state of the art design.  I already mentioned the lack of a frame.  Padding on the back and shoulders is very thin, and the pack is not adjustable to differing torso lengths.  Access to the pack is limited to the top.  There is a cinched trap door separator between the main body of the pack and the sleeping back compartment though, but overall it's difficult to generally pack this ruck.  Because of the design, the waist belt is going to have to awkwardly bear the weight of the ruck, and it's just not designed to do that.<br /><br />So, to be blunt - this is not a ruck I would consider taking on any kind of extended backcountry trip, or really even an overnight.  It just doesn't have the design to comfortably bear a load for a prolonged period of time.  What this IS is a turbo-look ruck.  One that will likely be at home as a carry on for an airplane trip, ersatz luggage, or other similar tame uses.  It's just missing the features and design that a genuine outdoor-intended ruck has.<br /><br />And this is why I don't like it.  It's sold as something it really isn't, and that's sadly a dealbreaker for me."
2.0,"I was so excited to get a pair of bell bottoms! I ordered two different pairs each from different companies and got almost the exact same jeans. Very stretchy, which is good tip fit you more, but I also worry about how well that elastic feeling will hold up after a few months. My biggest issue was that there was a huge bag in the area in the front. Idk what’s supposed to go there?! 😳😬😂 not for me!"
2.0,"Incredibly complicated. Even the directions give no help for getting even the time set, much less the alarms!  Not thrilled. Is there ANY online support? The cruddy directions that came with the product were no help."
2.0,I ordered larger and it's still tight. It's cute but not nearly as comfortable as I was hoping.
2.0,"I like the products, but i never got the moon tunnels like i paid for...smh"
2.0,"Don't stay on well, and look odd."
2.0,"too large, barely any tint"
2.0,"Lost a valve on my previous mask, and this one was pretty affordable and *looked* like the nice neoprene velcro mask I have. I figured that, with summer coming, having something that would allow my neck to breathe would be good. This mask, while it looks like others, is not of high quality. Zero stretch and ill fitting around the ears, the mask has little room for adjustment. The holes for the valves are unfinished and instantly started fraying the moment I tried to put the valves in (Yes, this mask comes unassembled, which my other one came pre assembled).<br /><br />The filter is simply a couple layers of paper and probably have no filtering at all. Sharp edges also make it uncomfortable. If you do get this mask, better off making some layers of cloth to put in. Also, the holes are mis-cut on the filters as well, and nothing matches up.<br /><br />Overall, pretty much a failure. Fit is HORRIBLE and there is no way to adjust. But, thankfully I was able to scavenge the valves off it and fit it to my much nicer mask.<br /><br />Don't bother."
2.0,Ring is beautiful BUT I wore it for a day and it already lost 4 stones down the side of the band.  Will be returning.
2.0,"Did not arrive on time, does not look like picture the ball is just silver"
2.0,Absolutely love these! And super high wasted so perfect. Only problem is they shrunk sooooo much when I put in dryer. Just go a size up if planning on drying.
2.0,"I love the dress but it is too tight, I normally take a medium, would need xlarge to feel comfortable, debating on ordering the bigger one, love the dress and the pattern"
2.0,The top part of dress was kind of big
2.0,"I bought two of the &#34;Belle Donne&#34; camisole tops, both size medium. The seller gives the impression that the tops you will receive will be &#34;Belle Donne&#34; brand but there is no such thing. In reality they sent me a size small in the active basic brand in black and a olive in size medium in the Zenana brand. (the olive color isnt green, it's an odd  brown color with slight green undertones) If I would have known that the tops were going to randomly selected from a grab bag of cheap tops I wouldn't have spent 10 bucks a piece on them!<br />The active basic brand tops are slightly better than the Zenana brand, so I would recommend getting the active basic four pack by Active Products on Amazon. It's 15 to 20 bucks (depending on the colors you choose) for four camis. It's a better value and you will actually get the tops that you see on the website so there won't be any surprises!"
2.0,"These are slightly plush wings.  The colors are vibrant and terrific.  The wings attach to the child's arms at the elbow and the hand which is great for them to 'fly.'.  Problem is, the elastic is short and not sewn on securely I had to reinforce all four spots.  One of them popped off the first time my daughter tried it on!  Nice idea, just cheaply made."
2.0,Don't waste your money. Looks like a prize from a traveling carnival in person. Wife wouldn't wear it once.
2.0,"I bought two packs for my shop.  I especially wanted the pineapple, watermelon, green apple, and grape charms. Unfortunately, those were the one that were broken and chipped. So, now I couldn't make 2 pairs because of the damage. The grapes were not broken, but they had large white spots all over them. I am going to try to paint them. The rest of the charms are adorable. I am just disappointed that the ones I really wanted I couldn't use because of damage."
2.0,Not boot cut at all flare leg
2.0,"I originally ordered  the Z5HENWEI  96 in Wine red longer raincoat but it was too fitted across the thighs for easy hiking. After paying the extra $10 to get this one oh, I was severely disappointed in the color. It's not even remotely close to wine red but a light purple mauve."
2.0,You get what you pay for. Ordered a small. I’m 5’4” 130lb. It is huge. A tent. At waist it measures 48”.<br />Fabric is a bit cheesy.  It came with red stains on it which did wash out. Just can’t get over how huge it is. Makes me look way bigger than I am.
2.0,The top was too big and the side shows your breast so get a cute black bra or just go braless due to it not covering how the picture shows.... I would say the pants fit just right but due to the cheap material I maybe only get one good wear our of it
2.0,The purse is nice but the seems already came apart rhe purse is not usable anymore and it didnt last a month.  I will not buy again.
2.0,Very cute but the bottoms are see thru.
2.0,"Item colors are not white and black buffalo plaid, more brown and navy"
2.0,Did not like the feel of this fabric don't like it touching me!
2.0,"The bag was super cute and the perfect size for carrying an iPad and a few necessary items for a day of workshops. However, by my second round of workshops the zipper had broken off.  Kinda disappointed that the zipper didn’t last more than a month."
2.0,I had to have this dress altered in order to fit my daughter for a Sweet 16 celebration. It was very big in the bust area and just wasn’t flattering although she made it work.
2.0,Cute dress but the material is paper thin.
2.0,Too small to short
2.0,Very flimsy and fragile
2.0,Was disappointed in the quality of the wig considering all the positive reviews. This wig was SUPER thin - there was no way to style the hair to cover the mesh cap underneath. The wig was promptly returned.
2.0,I thought this would be an interesting piece of jewelry but it is jus plain hard to wear. It fits on the wrist/arm so awkwardly. And it looks cheap. For the price I can’t complain too much....I took a chance
2.0,"Meh...just like every other mask I’ve gotten, too darn small. Seems well made and took the slow boat from China to get here, but can’t use it as I’m pulling it up my nose constantly as it rides down my face. Then when I pull it up it comes up my face. Also I’m pretty sure I traumatized a little girl at a rest stop while walking in, because it doesn’t really look like guy Fawkes when worn, just looks kinda scary."
2.0,"Not good for pear shapes, fit in bust but tight for hips. Liked the style and fabric piecing. But fabric was thin and cheap for the price, not very soft, a bit washed out in black, and attracted lint. The cowl neck did not come with the tie as seen in pic and on Neon Buddha website---hmmm??"
2.0,"While I can’t argue with the product description (it does say trucker hat) this cap fits like a foam trucker hat from the 70’s, goofy.  So make sure you order a CB radio for your family car, because this baby demands to hit this open road.  Material on the front has a satin looking shine to top it off."
2.0,They are cheap and bigger than i expected. Two of them were broken in the bag they came in.
2.0,Cheaply made and had a very odd/bad fit. Don’t recommend.
2.0,Not like the picture at all. But I'm gonna keep the blouse because it's still cool enough for me to wear.
2.0,Cheap material. Doesn’t even have finished sleeves. Just sewn on the end no cuffing. If I had it to do over again I wouldn’t do it.
2.0,"I wear a size 10 (US) shoe. These socks fit but need to stretch quite a bit. In turn, the low cut of the ""no-show"" sock is just too low for me. They feel like they may slip down and I have to extra careful when taking off my shoes. They work well for my son that wears an 8.5 (US). I'd say anything over a size 9 and be warned that they may be too shorty. Otherwise, seems well made and comfortable as long as they fit. I think the product description says it all in that they are marketing these towards ""men and women"". Sizing has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with size. Duh."
2.0,"You can see in my photos that the edges are poorly finished. The thumb is also extremely loose and long, making it prone to mess you up if you are using these gloves to protect from the UV lamp while doing your nails."
2.0,"For the money,, it is an ok product,, I wish they would have used elastic cord instead of plastic. And the beads are not authentic ,, the bottom line, I will be purchasing something of better quality really soon,, and then give this one to my niece for a starter braclet ."
2.0,"I've been discouraging my two little girls from getting their ears pierced,  by showing them super cute alternatives like clip on,  magnetic,  and pressure hoop earrings (which they LOVE)!<br />I've taught them about other social customs that involve cutting and scarring children,  unnecessary circumcision of both male and female babies,  Ritual beating of a young girls breasts, cutting and placing bone in eyebrow,  cheek, and lips, and brass rings around children's necks to unnaturally elongate, etc etc. Yet some of these very same cultures would view our society as &#34;barbaric&#34;  for poking holes in our babies and children.<br />Whatever your beliefs may be,  when you order CLIP ON earrings, it's typically because your child does not have pierced ears, and you are searching for a cute alternative.  I can't say these earrings are not cute...they are adorable. ..but NEITHER of my girls can wear the earrings sent to us and it's a costly hassle to return or exchange them!<br />Now I must give them away or wear them (and they are a little juvenile for me personally)  so my options are very limited."
2.0,"I bought this shirt for my son as he adores the TV show Superstore. It's honesty a disappintment and plan to send it back. First, the fit is tight  and the material is a bit scratchy, but that could soften in the wash, so I can't say for sure it would be uncomfortable. Second, the color isn't what you see on your screen - it's a darker blue. That's not the &#34;superstore&#34; color employees wear in the TV show, so it's a bummer. Finally, the printing isn't a pure white at all. It's almost like they diluted the ink...so it's a milky gray. Not what I was hoping for. Back it goes!"
2.0,It was beautiful but too small.
2.0,Cute but stinks of whatever was used to set the dye. I mean STINKS. A bit unbending and uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time without extra inserts.  But cute
2.0,"I guess that maybe it might be better than nothing, but when it does have results, it gives my glasses a halo effect that's really annoying."
2.0,"Good item, didn't last long. And need more compartment."
2.0,Not that durable and not very resistant to dirt either.
2.0,"First negative review I've written. I ordered two of these shirts after spending a long time reading reviews and looking into the sizing. I'm a dress size 12/14 so I ordered a 6XL (US 14) and it doesn't button at all. I have a DD chest but they fit into all my other clothes. But not these shirts. Also not anywhere close to being tunic length as shown in multiple reviewer photos. They barely cover my butt when unbuttoned. The color is saturated and true to the pictures so that's a plus. And the outside is a soft flannel. But the inside has a stiffer, scratchier hand to it. Hoping it softens up when washed. For the price, I'll keep to just wear as a light jacket or throw over a tank top. But I'd been hoping to wear with leggings and a wide belt as a tunic and that clearly won't happen. Disappointed..."
2.0,"So these earrings were super cute, but tarnished way too fast. I soaked them in peroxide like I do all my costume earrings because there’s no way that I’m sticking something in my ear without cleaning it and the gold ones were bronze by the end of the day."
2.0,"Not made very well. The fitting for the closure (Clasps) frequently come undone and the bracelet falls off, Hard to put on by yourself and is cheaply made. Not worth the cost and i would not recommend purchasing the product till a better design for closing the clasp is made."
2.0,Buttons not located symmetrically. Looks really odd when you wear it. The shade of red is too bright unlike what you see in the pictures
2.0,It's a great product. My problem is the fact I orderd two and revived only one.
2.0,The bag seemed nice.  I put a 23 pound folding bike in it and checked it with my airline.  Fit great but the bag quickly developed holes.  It's thin and not for heavier objects.  Use for lite duty carrying of posters from office to office maybe.  Careful setting it down.
2.0,"This is very cute, but runs very small. Don’t waste the $"
2.0,Two zippers were broken after one day of use. One outer and one inner pocket. Cheaply made. Lots of pockets but some are really useless.
2.0,Didn't look anything like the picture but more like a sagging diaper.
2.0,"Belt looks and feels great, but the two I had broke within a year.  The straight metal rod on the belt buckle fell off both of them.  Normal wear and tear.  Disappointing when they are that much $."
2.0,Fits like a man's shirt
2.0,"I love the little hat, but it looked like it was made by an 8 year old.  Poor quality, but fixable."
2.0,"I bought this for my wife's new apple watch. We liked the gold color as displayed on the website, but we changed our opinion when we saw it for real. The gold color was glossier than expected, which lent a plastic sheen and feel to the watchband."
2.0,It is states this is leather.  It is not.  It is some sort of plastic.
2.0,Bathing suit fit as expected but it is VERY cheaply made! WOULD not purchase again
2.0,"I wanted to love these as the color is fire, but they weren’t the best.  Not very comfortable or flattering"
2.0,The fabric is loud and scratchy. I can tell it was expertly sewn but this seems like liner fabric to me.
2.0,Way too big. Even on my brother who has the biggest head I know they look huge. But they are good quality in all other aspects.
2.0,"it looks patchy at times, like gas pilled on water you see on the ground... can give you a headache."
2.0,The wig itself is good; but the curl was made by having orange wire( with a visible difference in color) wrapped around a short strand of hair.
2.0,"shirt material is wierd. not soft and wearable, but harsh to the touch, was expecting more out of this.. thus only 2/5.. for me comfort is everything"
2.0,"Very disppointing! I ordered a size 5 ring. Instead, I received a size 4-1/2, as measured on two different ring sizer mandrels. I will have to return the ring."
2.0,"First off the wand sucks. Very poorly made, cheap plastic. Just received it in the mail today and it's already cracked. The scarf is decent quality and the tie too! Glasses are okay."
2.0,Beautiful Ring except it broke after a week of wearing. The stone fell out because a prong broke.
2.0,"These belts will not hold up pants, they are only for appearance, like cinching a sweater. Very lightweight elastic."
2.0,"I take a medium in most things, so that's what I ordered, and it fit great.  Long enough to cover my buns, the sleeves were a good length, the faux fur around the hood was soft and thick, and the inside of the pockets were very soft.<br />Why did I only give it 2 stars?  It's not very warm.  A coat has one job, and if it can't do it very well, back it goes.  I live in upstate NY and today the temp was in the 20s and snowing.  I wasn't shivering as I scraped off my car, but I definitely didn't feel like I had a winter coat on.  The sleeves especially weren't very warm, and I even had a sweater on underneath.  Also, the bottom is loose enough to let cold air up underneath.  If it wasn't warm enough for me today, I don't even want to attempt it in the negative digits we had last week.<br />Sigh. The search continues..."
2.0,They look cheap!
2.0,Top looks very different than pictured. Not great.
2.0,Thin and very cheap looking
2.0,"The hoodie looks nice and feels nice.  I wanted badly for it to work.  But if you're like me and on the bigger side of a 3X - forget it.  Having read the reviews on this page, I ordered a 5X even though I typically wear a 3X.  For discussion sake, I'm 6'3&#34;.  I received the 5X and it was like a tent on me - cartoonishly big and it literally hung a full 7&#34; below my hips.  Again - I'm 6'3&#34; - imagine how low it'd hang on a more average height person.  Oddly, even though it hung WAY too low, the arms were the perfect length for my frame.  I do not have ape like arms nor do I have atypical proportions - other coats and shirts fit just fine right off the 3X rack.  This 5X was **enormous* (which - a 5X should be).<br /><br />So - I returned the 5X and ordered a 4X.  Had I actually attempted to put it on, I would've likely needed crisco and perhaps a shoe-horn. Getting it back off would probably added a need for scissors and supplemental oxygen.  How is it that a 5X is absurdly *big* and a 4X is what any other company would call a 1X?  I put one of my son's XL shirts on top of this 4X hoodie and they were identical in width.<br /><br />That's just a fail - pure and simple.  It can't be that hard to figure out sizing."
2.0,Just got the package and excited to try it on. The dress has an awful fishy smell.  Not sure how it fits yet.  I will have to wash it first before I can trying it on.
2.0,"The color of this dress is a beautiful purple.  Unfortunately,  to wear I have to wear a slip - the dress is nearly see through.  Disappointed in the quality."
2.0,The item in question is perfect...Just not the item i thought i was getting from the item description and photo.
2.0,The color is not at all as pictured. The Rose's are the same color as the shirt.
2.0,Way to small !
2.0,"Regular quality, frames are uncomfortable and some have smudges that don’t let you see clearly. However the colors are awesome. Just keeping two pairs, the rest are gone. You get what you paid for, cheap glasses in the low quality end."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:fb2a92015123dd7a955211eaf6c761fb]] No markings and took a couple of months to get to me. Claimed to be sterling. I can wear it in rare occasions, but I know it will start turning colors if I wear it often."
2.0,Too big for my ears :[<br />Cute product just didnt fit well
2.0,[[VIDEOID:8c3aa1c27d913f23569a524be2ccbf97]]
2.0,Not as expected.  Small
2.0,wish i would have sent it back and gotten a bigger size but it was a christmas gift and she insist on wearing it.
2.0,It's a nice costumey material but definitely what I thought I was getting... I will say the sleek material is comfy and stretchy so that's nice. Definitely doesn't pass for the real Eda Letterman though.
2.0,Runs small.. order a size or 2 bigger
2.0,Didn't like the material (it felt kinda cheap and was too see through). I also found the cut unflattering
2.0,Broke after a few times of wearing. Tangled up all the time. Including taking it out of the plastic it was sent in.
2.0,"arrived early, as pictured.<br />Update:<br />After wearing the earringa for a month or so my daughter had a reaction to it....as well as lost one of the screw backs"
2.0,Great looking functional belt. Unfortunately it breaks for no reason. Only last 3 months of use.
2.0,The earrings are very thin and cheap looking.
2.0,SIZE VERY SMALL FOR LISTED SIZE
2.0,"The watch was a different color than what I was expecting, it was much more gold than what I consider rose gold."
2.0,Its very pretty. I bought it for my daughter anf she loves the necklace although she will not wear it because it constantly moves.<br />This is something I should've thought more about before buying so that is on me<br />I am just leaving this review for the next person who might not realize right away that this necklace does NOT stay where the pictures show.
2.0,"It looks as great as in the pictures. I love how it looks and hence the 2 stars. Otherwise, I wouldn't have kept this watch if I had known that I had to adjust it on a daily basis to keep it working!  It looses time even when you're wearing it during the day, very inaccurate! Doesn't do the job it was meant to do. I have never needed to worry about battery life for the 5years I've owned my Timex. Infact this watch deserves 1star! Disappointed."
2.0,I liked the colors & make but item is not true to size.
2.0,I ordered the &#34;Coral&#34; in a size Large. I am 5' 3&#34; and 125 lbs and it was too tight. This shirt definitely runs small. I am returning this item.
2.0,"I bought this because it was thin and for it's external pocket.  That pocket would come in handy for subway cards or anything I'd have to use often and quickly.  Even from day one it wasn't tight enough to hold even 3 normal cards.  I just tried, and even with 10 cards in the pocket they slide out when tipped upside down.  I've had frequent instances where everything comes out, not something you want happening with important cards."
2.0,"I ordered an extra large, received an extra large, but it was about the size of a small"
2.0,"This is a cute shirt and I get compliments whenever I wear it, but it won't stock crocking. Agh! It turns everything lighter than it pink, so I have to be really careful what I wear with it. I've washed it and washed it, but it's still making a mess. Very disappointing."
2.0,Returned. I runs large and the quality is poor
2.0,"I don't like the dress at all. The bust part is awkwardly cut and your armpit part look weird too. I'm 5'4 and 107lbs and the dress fit super bad. I have other dresses from other brands in the same design and they fit beautifully.<br /><br />If I decide to wear it, I'll have to put a layer underneath so the bust and armpit area don't look weird. Bad quality and the print is blurry."
2.0,Runs small.  I dont like tight things.  This was a tight medium.
2.0,Finish rubbing off and I haven't had it that long.
2.0,"I like the style of this jacket. But in the picture look more  stylist  and expensive , but not in person the belts are not made from real leather and they’re darker color ( as picture)  material from this jacket are thin. but over all look like knock off hope and Henry."
2.0,AS THE DRESS STRETCH THE COLOR WILL ALSO.
2.0,doesn't stay together well - very cheap feeling
2.0,It was not as well made or sparkling as picture showed. The edges were raw like it was just cut from a bolt of cloth
2.0,"Cute for sure but definitely not gold plated. Won’t last long. If you buy, have the expectation that it’s a temporary thing."
2.0,If you want cheap “all hype” glasses these are it.<br />I rather go with spy. Personally they feel super light/cheap and broke after a week. I like the look but the quality isn’t there and doesn’t come with a case. Your call.
2.0,When this tie came in I was disappointed. The fabric feels rather stiff and cheap. The gold plated leaf design came bent and took almost no pressure to bend it more. Was planning on wearing this to my wedding and bailed on the idea because it looked like something I could buy at a dollar store.
2.0,"Watch band broke after a month of use. The band is solid but the metal arms that hold the band to the mounting brackets snapped. The watch wasn’t even tight, and it snapped off. I wish I could fix it because it did I look nice, but I will now look for a higher quality band."
2.0,The product is of fair quality. I was charged twice for the shirts and only received and order one set!  BEWARE! The company is located in China gave me a boiler plate response and told me to contact Amazon in USA to resolve. Good luck with that.
2.0,"The dress is really cute, light weight. My first order XL fit but was not flattering. So I ordered a smaller size L fit perfectly HOWEVER when I actually was going to wear the dress as soon as I zipped it up the zipper broke. Really flimsy zipper so I had to give this 2 stars. And now it’s too late to return. So disappointed."
2.0,I wore it twice and the metal started coming out of the brim and stabbed me.
2.0,Quality is nice it’s just way to small! Measurements are not accurate at all and it doesn’t look exactly like the image displayed
2.0,eur sizes l do not know on me
2.0,Stretch out after a few uses.
2.0,La longitud es demasiado grande
2.0,the earrings were not as described on line
2.0,Neck is huge and not flattering its awkward hangs so weird.
2.0,They were ok back pieces were not good
2.0,"I finally got a chance to use it... Pretty color, Lightweight, comfortable, but the zipper broke with first use. It has been too long so I can't return. Unfortunately tho, I cannot recommend it."
2.0,"Way too big, no way to adjust it. I guess I got what I paid for."
2.0,it's nice but the wires the hold the beads on digs into my wrist with pointed metal.  Impossible to wear.  btw -the picture does not show how it opens.  I will take advantage of a-z return.
2.0,"I purchased these belts as replacements straps for ratchet style buckles and my search was for leather belt.  I also made the decision to purchase this particular item because it said ""genuine leather"", ""NO SMELL!"" and got good ratings.  When they arrived, the 'protective coating' on the belts are a plastic type material and the belts had a very strong petroleum odor.  The belts were wrapped in a plastic sleeve which contains the odor in the shipping box.  I am returning for two reasons:  1.  In my experience, these plastic/vinyl coated belts start peeling within a year with regular use.  That is why I am replacing my current ones.  2.  Products manufactured in China with this odor are often made using harmful, cancer linked chemicals that are banned in US manufacturing.  I have been frustrated at how difficult it has been to find a 100% geluine leather belt (except for the ratchet track) for a ratchet style buckle."
2.0,The shoes themselves were cute but mine came with a tear in the shoes like they were a used pair not happy with that
2.0,"Though the boots looked fantastic, they were not quite as wide as normal Women's Size 11 boots. If you don't have wide feet then that's not a problem, and if you're not already up in size 11, you may be able to get around that by ordering a size up.<br />Though, the boots were also slightly too pointy at the toe for my taste, which you don't really get a good look at in the picture. Super easy returns though if bought through Amazon. So they may be worth a try."
2.0,Loved them...til they broke a week after I received them...
2.0,The dress is very large considering I got a small and am usually a small at most places. The fabric was also extremely cheap
2.0,Dress showed up not like in the picture I ordered two of them and they are missing the belts
2.0,"Beautiful,  but not a good quality.  I got it for my sister and first day one of the charms came off.  😕"
2.0,Not wat I expected. Too big and not well made.
2.0,"So sad when I received this package. I only received thin gold rings. When ordering the pieces I ordered some gold, some silver. The pictures of this item of are of a variety of colors, in which they do not offer. The items took 20 days longer then the latest estimation. The items are wound/twisted too tight so you are unable to unhinge the ball to put the piercing in causing them to be unusable."
2.0,This isn't an officially licensed t-shirt like advertised not good quality I'm very disappointed
2.0,"Is a really pretty dress im not gonna lie ,but is too short and small, I had to give it to my niece by the way i bought S size"
2.0,"I ordered the correct size but the dress isn't very flattering - it is drapey and loose, just like the photo, but on a skinny person it looks like you are wearing a sack. This should have come with a belt to make it look less wide and floppy.<br /><br />It might look better on a curvy or full figured person, but on slender women it just feels formless."
2.0,The description says three pair for $16 but I only received one pair.<br />This seems to be a great product and I would love to give a positive review but the description is deceiving.
2.0,I wear a size 12 shoe.  My foot would not fit inside this even if I forced it.
2.0,"This dress was cheaply made of a thin stretchy material...great for a costume party ...not what I was looking for, which was a semi-formal dress for a wedding.  I sent it back."
2.0,"Both necklaces I bought broke, one broke as soon as I pressed on the latch to open it to put it on the other broke later on for my brother, as expected of price."
2.0,Look cool but very thin and poorly made.
2.0,"The tie is described as Extra Long but seems shorter than my regular length ties. Sits about four inches above my belt and I am 6'0&#34; tall. I think the ties would fit a high school freshman properly, but not anyone taller than 5'9&#34;"
2.0,"too large, ordered small and fits like XL"
2.0,The Guraio Rope Bracelet was ok. Looked a lot better on line than when I received them. Was sort of disappointed. But then you get what you pay for.
2.0,"These are NOT compression socks! Seriously, this is a false ad as these are just ok socks for regular summer wear for those who like ankle socks. If it wasn't a pain I'd return and put that $$ toward Another product."
2.0,The shoes were too big so I ended up giving them away. Very disappointing!
2.0,The design of these is strange.  It's like they're built for flat-faced individuals or something.  They dont sit right on my son's face and fall off his nose if he looks down.
2.0,I'm returning this. The v-neck dip went all the way to the tie at the upper waist. It didn't cover my bra at all. It isn't wearable as a dress. The material is somewhat see through when held against the light.
2.0,"I'm with the other people stating that the photo of the woman with the earings is extremely misleading, they are much much smaller and being returned."
2.0,Cute socks but too small. I think they are made for little girls.
2.0,Item fit was too small.
2.0,These pants were see through. I returned them.
2.0,"My wife was excited about this. And thought about getting one for my work backpack. But is just to dim.<br />At first i thought it must be defective batteries. Changed them, same amount of light."
2.0,"I guess I did not correctly read or understand the description of this coat. There is no lining in the sleeves, only the body/vest and hood. Arms are no thicker than windbreaker material. Very disappointed. Waiting to hear back from company regarding return. Already prepared for high return shipping fee and restocking fee."
2.0,Love the mask fabric - love the color! The fit of the material is horrible
2.0,"These are awful. Multiple places on these shorts would need to be stitched up including 3 pockets, to make these even wearable."
2.0,Cheap stitching.  It tore when after a few uses to where I need to stitch it.  Cheap price meaning cheap materials.  I will not buy this product ever again.
2.0,I was disappointed with this one because I had ordered a plain black one prior and LOVED it!! This unfortunately was a completely different material (stiffer not the flowy jersey like the black one) . This makes the draping not as flattering. Also the return process was a pain and not worth it based on the price so I was gunna return it but didn’t. Hoping it’ll Atleast soften as it gets washed and I can wear it at home as a loose comfy house thing.
2.0,The product was not up to my expectations
2.0,The cardboard inside the hat will ruin your day if it gets wet. Don’t try and clean it. It deforms and looks terrible. Not worth the price
2.0,Doesnt look as nice as pictured.  Wish I hadnt taken off tags and had returned it
2.0,"I ordered this dress for my wife because she liked it as it was advertised on the website. The neck line came in crew neckline and Not V-necked as advertised. The skirt was too long and the waistline was very close to her breasts. The material on the top makes her arms smell, when in reality she does not have body odor. The skirt gets static, I believe it's the polyester material. She liked the patterns on the skirt and that is the only reason why this is a two-star-review."
2.0,"This is a cute skirt but it was thinner than I expected and after one wash, it shrank and was extremely wrinkled. Disappointed at the quality, especially for the price."
2.0,I wanted to like this so much but its not the case. The print is cute but blurry and im not sure it will last long.
2.0,I ordered a red and it look more orange than red. Not what I expected👎
2.0,The band's retainer pin would not stay in place and my watch kept falling off.
2.0,"This was too big , good but not my favorite"
2.0,"I had these for awhile, the seller or I had to open the case which I forgot because it's been awhile so ya I think I got my refund back because when I first got it one of the lights wasn't working but they are good product, comfy, I still recommend this"
2.0,Once more an XL is too small for my average-sized body.  The fabric is overly wrinkly even for just wearing at home.
2.0,"Description is very misleading/confusing. These are 1/2 ct tw and smaller than i hoped for, they dont shine like id hope so ya there you go"
2.0,Pretty design<br />Turned copper with wearing
2.0,"They started as short shorts; they washed to child sized. Even in cold ultra handwash delicate w mild soap they became half the size. They still stretched, but they became minuscule in size none the less.<br />It was, however, a hastle free return. 2 stars."
2.0,does not have a inside liner...not what I expected...we use them as shorts since they were a bit pricey.
2.0,Worked twice very dissapointed
2.0,"Dislike the size and I was hoping my niece get more wear than a day,because I no how 2 deal with all kinds of clothesline 2 shoes 4 infants up & that's not going 2 last long f the mom wash/dry it the wrong way blessed  b it's"
2.0,Coat was huge.
2.0,"I was totally disappointed in this product. After hearing great claims on how nice these Koda botties were, I found that the quality was not as claimed. The lacings unraveled after only a couple of hours of wear and I returned them. I then purchased a similar pair from a Canadian manufacture which turned out to be far better quality wise."
2.0,"Just got this shirt in the mail. I really wish I had read the reviews. Opened it up and it says ""Jane"" across his chest. Looks like someone accidentally wrote on the print and they just printed them anyways. Bought this for my 10 years olds birthday party. Hoping she doesn't notice. The photo is blurry too. Overall disappointed."
2.0,"This dress looked great in the photos, but not in person. The fabric is not comfortable, the bodice is larger than the size suggests, and the pleat in the front puckers out. I returned the dress for all the above reasons."
2.0,It was too short for my piercing but super cute
2.0,"I got it and the material was cheap, but okay for what I have in mind, but it was missing the belt/decorative part and there were no instructions. Debating on returning the entire thing. Very disappointed."
2.0,These were a waste of money.  The plastic broke apart from the frame after 1 use and it was impossible to get it back in place.  They went in the garbage.
2.0,I didn't receive a tie for one of the vest tuxedo
2.0,At first I really liked this bathing suit for the price. My grandparents have a pool so I bought it to keep at their house. So I have worn it very little. The maybe third or fourth time I was wearing it the underwire came out. So even though it is on the cheaper side be prepared for it not to last long.
2.0,Not what I was expecting. I brought the glasses because I thought people couldn't see your eyes while looking at you which they can
2.0,"I ordered these sunglasses for party for my husband.  I wanted to get some glasses that were just cheap and fun.  That is exactly what I got.  They were a great price and they all held up well my biggest issues were that the lenses were horrible!  It was incredibly hard to see out of them so no one wore them.  Also, these are very small.  They fit women's heads but did not fit the mens.  Overall they look good but that is about it.  They were a total bust for the party."
2.0,The bottom is a terrible cut. Completely awkward and Unflattering. Very tight around leg holes and narrow around crotch. Goes right up your butt and cuts into Your butt cheeks. Not cute unless you have very skinny legs and no butt it may look okay. The high waist was also not flattering like thought it could be. It’s a return from me sadly.
2.0,I got 2 sets and all four earrings were a different shade of silver/bronze.  The eyes on all four were an ugly shade of yellow.
2.0,"Such a cute top but it seems as if it's made for petite and cup size A ladies. I am a 38C and ordered a large. It was SO tight in the chest area and the seam is way too high. If I move my arm up the seam moves up to mid-breast area. Not at all like the photo and certainly not ""loose"" as in the description. I washed it in hopes that it would soften and be more pliable but no.  I'll keep it in hopes that I lose the covid weight that I gained but super disappointed. Not sure why these sellers can't get their sizing correct and to match what is on their size charts. Incredibly frustrating. Why is that SO difficult?"
2.0,"Los talles están muy mal indicados marcados compre para 6 años y creo que el talle corresponde a 4 años.<br />Bastante mala calidad, esperaba algo mejor"
2.0,Looked real nice online. But wen I opened up the box it was soo cheap looking. And is already falling apart after a few days. Price too much for wat it is. Good for occasional uses not for everyday wear at all.
2.0,"Oh I hated it. It wasn't the suit, just maybe my body type. I have a short torso and the skirt literally sat on top of my hips. As a bigger girl you can imagine how flattering that was."
2.0,too lightweight
2.0,Doesn't look like a real one.
2.0,"The neckline is much higher on this dress than the model. The waist tightening also hits under my boobs rather than at my waist. I wish it fit differently, it looks/fits like an Amish dress. It also feels cheaply made."
2.0,"good charm no knock on company, made for women necklace"
2.0,I need a triple x
2.0,"Cute leggings. Definitely more on the cheap side, pretty see through. Low star rating because they came dirty."
2.0,"I’m not sure if it was just the one I received or if they’re all like this, but where the strap connects to the front of the bra is very sharp and it rubs the skin anytime I move my arms. I took a file to the fabric and loosened up whatever adhesive they used and now it’s fine, but doing that obviously isn’t good for the fabric and eventually it will cause the strap to tear."
2.0,way smaller than advertised. sending back for a bigger size
2.0,"It's very awkward to get on and even when I do manage to get it in, it feels like something is tickling my ear all day. It's cute, and I've got a lot of compliments on it, but its barely worth it."
2.0,"Cute print and concept, but the shape of the dress is weird. Instead of a smooth transition at the waist to an A line shape skirt, it puffs out and the skirt is more of a bell shape (but not quite enough for it to look like it's on purpose so it just looks awkward). This odd shaping at the waist makes the pleats look weird too. It's a bit hard to see in pictures but very noticeable in person.<br /><br />I am 5'3&#34;, approx 120 lbs, and aside from the weird shape an XS fit perfectly. But I will be returning this item."
2.0,"I got these and promptly had to return them. The size stone and appearance of them was perfect however, the yellow gold color was extremely brassy/tarnished looking.  I had never seen that color of yellow gold in my 50+ years.  Sadly, I had to return them because I could not live with that even at the excellent price."
2.0,"I am only giving it a two because it is exactly as shown, but I ordered a tiger one and got a cheetah one so I was unable to wear it to the party and had to find something last minute. So frustrating:/"
2.0,"These Chinese manufacturers should have a completely separate sizing system for the United States.  I typically wear a Large.  Based upon some recommendations, I purchased an XXL.  Even the XXL fits me like my four year old’s soccer jersey. Is this ever going to improve?"
2.0,"I love the pattern but the material is extremely thin. I am 5""8 150lbs and it high waters on me. I tried just rolling them up to make the capris but the material is so thin it wouldn't hold the cuff. I tried to return it but the wouldn't take it back but did issue a refund which I received within 2 days."
2.0,"UPDATE: I've had this watch for exactly a week and yesterday, a very essential part of the watch broke off; i'm unable to secure it because of this reason. In addition to that, the date is always one day behind despite changing this setting multiple times. I essentially bought this watch because it had great reviews but its important now to note essentially you get a free gift if you give this 5 stars. I had initially given it 4 because of reasons given below (my original review)<br /><br />I was worried about the look because I don't like things to sparkle but the details give a nice shimmer to it; I love that it has the date on it as well so its very useful. The warranty makes it really easy to return if something goes wrong. Overall, I'm happy with it. I'm not really into watches so I was looking for something simple; the only thing that bothers me is how long the band is and how thick it feels; I have tiny wrists so it may not the watches fault but just a note"
2.0,Fit was fine. My issue was that the tibial bone (lower leg) ended where my knee cap was. There was at least 18 inches of black fabric before my ankle. It looked very awkward. I hope to exchange/return.
2.0,It was just too big for what I wanted to use it for.
2.0,The pendant was bigger than the description led on .
2.0,Great wallet while it lasted. For some reason the money clip is pulling out of the wallet. I cannot push it back in. Makes it uncomfortable in your pocket.  Won't buy another. Maybe try a different brand.
2.0,"Otherwise, seems like a decently made shirt. Just can't button it. Or move my arms. No way to know if they sent the size I purchased, since the tag has neither the size or a measurement that makes any sense to me."
2.0,"I was really looking forward to my EyeSnug. However, the light still gets through from the nose gap. I really need complete darkness. The materiel is a nice, soft, cool material.<br /><br />I guess I'll be keeping them though because I threw away the box."
2.0,I don't like it period. Great price for someone who likes it.
2.0,"Yeah they take a while to arrive, but I absolutely loved these glasses. Unfortunately they snapped very soon after I got them. You get what you pay for but I’m not sure if they’re worth the wait again."
2.0,"I bought this shirt in white and the first thing I noticed when I opend the mailer in natural indoor light was that the white wasn't a clean, bright white and it had a purple-ish hue to it, if that makes any sense. I have an ivory colored shirt that seemed more &#34;white&#34; than this one.<br /><br />Fit-wise: I bought this in both an XXL and an XXXL based on reviews. The XXXL fit but it clung a bit too much to my problem areas than I was comfortable with. The weight of the fabric was only slightly sheer. If I could wear a plain smooth nude t-shirt bra it wouldn't be an issue, but &#34;my cup runneth over&#34; and my bra options are few and with embroidery. I had to return them."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:100bcb6c848f8907e98d11234d10770f]] Right shoe would not lite up. Just keeping them so he can know his right from his left. Would have loved to return them. Yet it's Christmas Day & we are in a rural town surrounded by water with no boys shoes in stock. Our boy desperately needed new shoes.<br />They look sturdy and the one that does lite up has great colour. If the lite ends up working...I will change the rating. Until than...I am a little put off that it's not working.
2.0,"I am a small female and so I bought a medium just to size up one for fit and account for shrinkage. This shirt is cut boxy wide and short cropped and I will definitely need to attend special treatment wash and dry this which is very disappointing. Let's be honest, I got what I paid for, its not like it was going to be quality for $16. It is soft and comfy however"
2.0,"These were really bad quality, I didn’t expect much because they were cheap but they are even lower quality than I expected."
2.0,This bleeds even when it’s dry.i may return
2.0,Barely opened & almost broke putting it back together!  ** Returned immediately **
2.0,It’s cute and sturdy but very tight on my 2.5 year old’s head. His head is normal sized. He tried it or twice and the refused to wear it due to discomfort.
2.0,"Do not wash these and definately do not put in the dryer at any temperature. I washed on cold and dried on delicate low.<br />The thread used to stitch them shrinks. The hem is now waffled and the side seams are wavy and bulge in and out like gathered drapery. Wish I had washed them earlier before the return window closed.<br />Dang it. The really fit so nice. Dang it.<br />Original review:<br />5’3 and 154 lbs. i ordered the medium. They are stretch  nice weight fabric. The waist lays flat, no roll. The legs ate semi straight nit tapered or skinny. Very flatering and about 4 inches above the base of my ankle.<br />Super  comfortable. Perfect for chunky heeled sandals."
2.0,Too heavy. Didn't realize they are worn BEHIND the earlobe. Not impressed.Plan to make into hair barrettes.
2.0,This jacket was not as cute as expected and it had some weird shoulder pieces on it that isn't in the image! May look better on others but I didn't like the look or fit!
2.0,"Beautiful earrings, but the sapphire is so dark blue that they seem like black stones.  Sapphires should be a deep blue."
2.0,Bars are too long and you can’t change the bars because one end is soderd on :(
2.0,These are short in the foot length so by the time you pull them up they wind up 3/4 calf.  In addition I ordered the polka dot large calf by mistake but they fit better than this striped pair even though I don't usually need a large calf size.  I'm glad it worked out for at least one of the 2 pairs of socks that I ordered from this company.  If you pull the foot of the sock in place for this striped pair it is tight enough for your toes to curl.  Not comfortable so in the Goodwill pile they go!
2.0,These nose rings are cute for aesthetic purposes like if your taking a few pictures with them. But to just wear they will fallout on you no matter how tight you think you have them.
2.0,Strap does not stay and hard to keep on shoulder
2.0,Garment runs small order a size or two up if you want a looser fit.
2.0,wish it had fit.
2.0,the color is wrong
2.0,"This was a very pretty dress, however, it was not for me. The color of the dress was darker than the pictures show. And there was a good inch or so between buttons, so they easily popped open or separated when you sit down. In the end it would have been too much of a hassle to wear."
2.0,"The bathing suit cover looks more like a dress. The picture is prettier than what you actually get.<br />It is very thin material and if you are wet this dress it sticks to you like glue. It runs very small, so I would size up 2-3 sizes. It is very tight through the arms and the seams run across your breast instead of below them.<br />Not much value for the money. This is something I would expect to find at Dollar tree for a couple bucks.<br />I will be donating this to Goodwill and hopefully someone can get some use out of it."
2.0,"i didnt like the color. gave it to my mom, she loved it"
2.0,The 2 sets with flowers on them are hideous. The photo shows nice looking flights and I got cartoon crap.
2.0,After 3 days of use the nose bridge cracked and broke apart. I never dropped the glasses or damaged them in any way. I gave it 2 stars cause I really liked them. I will continue to look for similar glasses that will last.
2.0,"Not worth the low price. I wish I'd spent the money on more expensive and sturdy sunglasses.  The little logo on the front of the lens looks dumb but you can't really see it when they are on your face.  I didn't try to remove it but I'd guess that acetone might take it off pretty cleanly.  The fit was very nice on my giant head compared to most other sunglasses I've tried.  They were a little heavy but not uncomfortably so.<br /><br />After about 2 months the left earpiece broke off at the hinge.  I had them hanging on a zipper pull and they were only dangling under their own weight from the side of my backpack when I wasn't wearing them.  I picked up my pack and saw the glasses laying on the ground and when I picked them up, the two pieces were already separate.  They pretty much just fell apart without any traumatic impact.  I'm not ready to spend 15 times as much for top end sunglasses, but for 4 times the price I could probably find a pair that lasted 10 times longer at least."
2.0,"Disappointed in the lack of color, possibly because the stones were so small and not as pictured."
2.0,Im 5 ft and this is more of a night gown on me but very soft to sleep in
2.0,The top of this is not big enough or stretchy enough to fit over the top of boots.  Might fit a very small girl.
2.0,to thin on the sides. it was correct size but too skinny. also they don't stay on well in the back. they move like sandals
2.0,"Use these for work. The straps snapped off the mask while wearing them.  I reinforced with clear glue, in order to fix the problem."
2.0,Pretty bummed!  Absolutely loved the necklace.  I had it  under a month and I just realized the stone fell out when I was wearing it
2.0,Pretty but the clasps come undone as if they are broken but they're not.  Come apart way too easily and ****the middle jewel came off and lost on the very first time I wore it.  Just eh..
2.0,Did not like the way it fit at the top.
2.0,"Its hard to put them on & once its on, its not too secure"
2.0,"Didn't care for the material, not a good buy."
2.0,XL fit more like a M/L. The color was as expected
2.0,"It’s a nice boot but too “clunky” for me to ride in.  If you want warmth, it would most likely do the trick but the foot bed too large in the stirrup"
2.0,Did not receive the hat pictured. The one I received did not have the leather detail on the brim.
2.0,"The fabric looks like a flat sheet. They're a nice shape but too small and too short. I'm a US xl on the top and bottom. Xl is more like a large. I'm 5'5"" and they are too short."
2.0,"Color not the royal blue wanted, looks washed out; gold accents look cheap"
2.0,Chrome or silver ring lost its color the first time I washed my hands.<br /><br />Fit is large.
2.0,I got this as a gift and let me say how much I really wanted this necklace. I had this on my wish list forever this and a silver one. I was so very disappointed when I got it. The Tardis is larger than I expected and not very well made the base of the Tardis is coming off from the main body it looks crooked and not very well made. It's a nice decoration but not something I feel like I could wear.
2.0,"Sized up based on reviews. Could have gone with a large for bottoms at least. LOVE the color. The top is not what I thought I was getting. Too short, does not cover chest."
2.0,"Ordered the black - there is chipped paint and a couple loose rhinestones with some rhinestones very crookedly placed. I'm a handy gal, so I'll fix the thing - but I have yet to wear it, so no idea how it will hold up."
2.0,They fit great and are so soft. The only down thing would be where the plastic tag was inserted. It was put below the waistband not in it causing a small hole. Hopefully the hole doesn’t get bigger. Other than that perfect!  A few weeks after buying they already have holes. I hand washed and hung dry. Just disappointed since I really liked them.
2.0,The only reason I didn’t return this was because my daughter really wanted to wear them! The pants do not match the top and they were way way to small! I was very disappointed since they were her Christmas Eve pajamas...
2.0,Cute set.. but wing straps snapped within minutes of wearing them.
2.0,"I liked how it was thick and the glow was great, but it’s made crazy long in the body, the crotch stops mid thigh and the legs were SO short they ended mid calf. I’m bummed I wanted this to work!"
2.0,2 sets broke before I even got to wear them...disappointed
2.0,This dress will best fit a tall person. Nothing about this style fell where I thought it should. Someone who is slim and tall will do better justice. It was wrong for me.
2.0,Product was much too large for my face even though I normally wear a large band was on adjustable and unremovable could not tighten close enough and did not sit right on the back of my neck would not buy again.
2.0,Cute at first but the print rubs off very quickly.
2.0,The fit and style differ from the picture.
2.0,"Dress is not as pictured.  Not nearly as deep of a v-neck, much thicker straps, and very short.  I am 5'4"" and it didn't even touch the tops of my feet.  Material was nice and thick and beautiful color.  Just wasn't as pictured.  I could get the dress I received for half the price anywhere else.  Sending back.  Not worth th money at all."
2.0,Nice socks but it states it is a 12 pack and I only received 6 pair
2.0,"Hard to open, hard to fold up small enough to get back into the case. It has a flimsy feel."
2.0,Looked nothing like the picture. I expected a distressed sweater and received a plain gray polyester type of sweater. The fit is fine and I'll wear it but the picture is greatly misleading.
2.0,The rose gold one broke immediately. The rainbow one is mostly green. The only reason they get 2 stars is because they don’t my ears at all.
2.0,The string is too short if you're 240lbs or more. An inch or two longer would have made all the difference in the world
2.0,Cute idea just too small for one of my sons
2.0,I love this watchband and get tons of compliments. My issue is that my silver watchband is now turning pink. I’m guessing it’s the metal under the silver coating - brass?<br />It’s starting to look unsightly after only a short while of use
2.0,Look so cute but completely disintegrated during first wear at the River.
2.0,beautiful Bra. but runs small
2.0,Cute pattern but way too big
2.0,I read the reviews and from the picture of the yellow dress it looked perfect.It was anything but.The plus is the soft material.But also see through.I recieved one which I took pictures of to show it is clearly not made well.The V of the neck is to the side and bubble's out.The threading is bad.The hem is shorter and uneven in the front.Very noticeably uneven.I was looking for a yellow long dress like this but it is not as I expected.So disappointed .I wish it was made better than what I recieved.The reviews were good .But I can never tell anymore when multiple reviews are for different item's.So I did take pictures of the dress so other buyer's can see the actual dress.
2.0,"It doesn't mention this in the description, but this dress is a wrap around. Not what I had expected. Otherwise, the fabric was soft, and the cut fit nicely in the shoulders/chest. The slit was WAAAAY too high. I would not have been able to breathe or move without getting arrested! Looks great on the model though! Returned."
2.0,Snug in weird spots and shrunk with first wash. Cheap material used.
2.0,"Cute, but incredibly short and SMALL. I ordered an XL and it fits more like a M or L. Not flattering for big busted girls as there's not enough material for it to flow right. Will be returning."
2.0,The pompoms (2) fell off the first night I used this purse. I was at a restaurant having dinner and I picked up the purse to go to the ladies room and lost one. The second came off as I was leaving
2.0,Bad sewing :(
2.0,Not soft cotton. Very thick hard and rigid
2.0,Bought this in November. Wore it a few times and washed it once . The garment has begun to have fur balls from the material . Disappointed to have this happen . Ages the product
2.0,"These are super cute, but they’re way small. I think they might fit a 5 or 6 yo tops."
2.0,A lot of the were on before I opened the package. Batteries were run down and dying. A lot of Switches are defective. And a few designs are broken .
2.0,Kind of a cheap fabric
2.0,Cute cheaply made size irregular bought a small top portion very big couldn’t button lady button not worth the money way too much for poor quality
2.0,Not flattering on a curvy shape at all
2.0,Earrings have a cheap gold finish and many of the lever backs don’t close properly...wouldn’t buy again
2.0,"Great price, but yet get what you pay for. The band broke within 6-8 months."
2.0,Disappointed.  Colors dull. Returned for refund.
2.0,Size down as it runs large
2.0,It's not what I wanted it looked a lot better in the picture.
2.0,It's not the quality or look that I was hoping/expecting.
2.0,I didn’t like it cause I got a large and it was very small and the texture was Terrible
2.0,They didn't help at all. Same glare level as with my regular glasses.
2.0,Not a true black and is shorter than i hoped. Probably will try to figure out how to return
2.0,Very nice looking watch for the price. It stops though if you put it down upside down on a table when you take it off and you have to flick/tap the face to get it started again. Quite odd.
2.0,I didn't like that the fabric is thin and my panties show through depending on my position. I am a professional person not looking to have that exposed. More of a wear around the house dress for that to be acceptable.
2.0,"Very small, looks comfortable but runs small……"
2.0,Too short for a 50 year old and I’m only 5’5
2.0,It is okay except you can totally see through the material. I would not be comfortable wearing this on it's own.
2.0,Too heavy for me to wear
2.0,I had to return this dress. Loved the cut and fit but the fabric of the white dress was just too sheer and not compatible with any slip that I could find due to the neck plunge.
2.0,"This coat picks up EVERYTHING!  It’s not really warm but it looks good.  If you keep a lint brush on hand, you will love the looks you get in this coat."
2.0,"Ordered the same dress, same size, just 2 different colors. Sizing was completely different. One fit great the other was tiny! I would not purchase again"
2.0,"I gave this two stars simply because it seems like it's at least decently made. Other than that, the shirt looks completely different in person- I was expecting a cute, girly t-shirt with flowers on it but the actual shirt feels cheap and slinky- like granny PJ's. The print also looks different- looks granny-ish and not like in picture."
2.0,Does not keep very good time even on a watch winder
2.0,Had to return these.  Ran about 1.5 sizes smaller than every other shoe we own.
2.0,Stretchy but small even for my wife's face.  Must be carefully and slowly stretched to fit or you will rip the middle seam.  Wear them right out of the package and your ears look like Yoda.
2.0,"I placed in for a childs pandora, but it was the size for an adult"
2.0,"Very thin but very cute.  Way too small though! They did not have an XL, but I figured they would be a little stretchy and they would be fine. I could not get them past my thighs."
2.0,Way too big and my head is in no way small so this is surprising. Since I missed the return window I might try to sew it smaller but I had high hopes for this.
2.0,Socks were more like ankle socks. Very small!
2.0,"I like the feel of the tank tops, but the first time I put one on, I found a hole along the side, seam line."
2.0,Thinner than I expected.  Afraid she'll break it. Don't think it was worth 25$. Maybe 10$-15$ at best..
2.0,"Extremely cheap materials, especially the backpack. We ordered a size up and top fitted as expected but shorts were quite too big, my son is pretty slim though."
2.0,I love the design and size but earrings were stuck together on arrival.  I separated them and hoped they’d dry but several days later I wore them and one stuck to my neck and turned my skin black.  So these are NOT functional.
2.0,DURABILITY IS NOT A CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS WATCH. LOOKS GREAT... INDEED... BUT WITHIN 2 MONTHS THE ADJUSTING STEM<br />BROKE OFF. WHAT A SHAME . . . THE WATCH IS NOW WORTHLESS.
2.0,Fits strange for my size.
2.0,Should have ordered a size smaller.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I had this on for too long to return it.  When I first put it on, I was pretty happy except for the straps - they dug in an awful lot if they were tight enough to be useful.  They also were astonishingly short.  I'm 5'2&#34; in the morning on a good day, and have a very, very short torso.  So short, I can wear regular length pants even though I'm barely 5'2&#34;.  I had to loosen these to within 3 inches of maximum.  I'm not sure they are long enough to cross them in the back, and I'm sure they aren't long enough to use halter - style.  So if you're very tall, I can't imagine this would work at all.<br /><br />After a while though, I realized the front had rolled up all the way to the underwire, and nothing I did would get it to stay down.  It made a big fat roll that I'm sure would be very noticeable under anything that wasn't baggy.<br /><br />I normally wear a 36C, sometimes a 38C if it runs small.  having read lots of reviews suggesting ordering a band size up and a cup size down, I ordered the 38B.  The band size was just big enough.  The cups were a little on the small size.  Did give me great cleavage.<br /><br />Overall, I'm guessing that if you are under 5'5&#34;,  have little to no body fat, and either (a) have super perky girls (and I do mean super perky, as in not just that you look good without a bra, but no sag at all) that don't put any weight on the straps and/or (b) have scant C cups or smaller, this could probably work very well for you."
2.0,"these were listed as size 8 they were much too small.  In addition, my step daughter wears a size 7 and could barely get her foot into them."
2.0,"I thought these were very cute when they arrived, however, one of the buttons fell off the first time I wore them and I lost it, so I have not been able to wear them again."
2.0,"Does NOT look like the picture, can't see the printing, rough edges, ......DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
2.0,"This watch is that absolute worse , it's basically a super expensive for no reason, the movement is bland and subpar yet it's priced like a swiss watch,by a Hamilton,Tissot or Oris instead"
2.0,Not made for american men  4x. A child large.
2.0,"I had to return for 2 reason, all styrofoam of this box was broken and got into the rhinestone while received it, looks like it box was damaged previously then I felt gold color rhinestone is too bright and this clutch drops open loosely so wide that things will fall from the bag. I ordered another style and I loved it."
2.0,Dress was see through and very thin. And it did. Not fit it was too small.
2.0,They Are Very Nice But To Big For My Face
2.0,"I've worn each pair from the 3 pack about twice per week for the last 6 weeks while working out. They fit well and seemed to be good quality, but today a seam on my outer thigh failed. I had hoped I'd found my new ""go to"" workout pants, but I was wrong."
2.0,"This dress is lightweight and stretchy, so would be comfortable, except the waist is way too high. If the waist was 2 inches  lower, I would have kept it, but the way it was, I had to return it."
2.0,Wonderful bedroom shoe HOWEVER the sole is already separating hoping the manufacturer will replace since we only had a few weeks
2.0,Ordered a 5X size because the reviews said it runs small. It is children size. In normal sizes the 5x is between a medium and a large. Gave it to a skinny friend.
2.0,Very nice feeling material but runs very small. Having to send them back.
2.0,It's see through its not as long as I thought and the material is worse then the fabric you can buy from walmart for the price and quality I promise your buying a nightgown
2.0,The necklaces are beautiful but I got them for my daughter and myself. Mine has been fine so far but on my daughters the lotus flower fell off after less than a month of wear... did not even realize the flower was a spare peice of the necklace until this happened but it is very disappointing
2.0,"If you're looking for a garment that you can wear once or twice then throw away, then this is it.  The material thin.  I'm not confident it will survive the normal wash cycle."
2.0,They turn everything bright yellow!
2.0,"Well, it's fine for the 79 cent price tag. The coating is chipping off after wearing it for one day."
2.0,Looks like paper.
2.0,From photos it shows that its kind of long but it just goes to waist line. Material sames fine but I needed it longer so not happy with it. I will not wear it. Not gonna send it back cause It would cost just as much as the blouse cost. Gonna see If I could give it away r just gonna be picked up.
2.0,"I was looking for a pair of fairly inexpensive polarized sunglasses, and these came up as highly rated.<br />I had a pair of polarized RayBans which was stepped on.. didn't want to spend that amount of money again.<br /><br />Style wise, these look great- which is why I'm giving 2 stars and not one.<br />Usage wise- they are horrible. Polarized sunglasses need a lense that slightly curves, otherwise there is terrible glare.<br />The lenses on these sunglasses are totally flat, which creates an awful glare. I put them on whenever I'm driving/ walking outdooors, and find myself taking them off because that glare is just unbarelable and impairs my ability to see properly."
2.0,Screws always fall out of the temples
2.0,This is made of very poor material.  Not a nice feel to it. It’s sitting in my closet and will probably stay there.
2.0,Super long and not well designed done plus runs small
2.0,This is a deceptive product listing. That's not great!
2.0,"This ring is not gold filled, as stated. It has a very thin plating of gold colored material, which has rubbed off in two weeks of wear. Boo. 👎🏼👎🏼"
2.0,It is to small to be a &#34;bangle&#34; bracelet unless it is for a child or someone with very small wrist. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for a friend. I wished I had known before spending the money and losing the time.
2.0,"Unfortunately, this top is unwearable. It's actually quite pretty, but it's way too sheer to wear out of the house. I expected a layer of chiffon overtop of an opaque lining, but instead it's two layers of chiffon. You can see EVERYTHING through it, and with the halter neckline there is no way to wear a cami or something underneath.  My husband would like me to keep it as lingerie."
2.0,It was an inexpensive shirt and it looks it. The picture was a lot nicer than reality.
2.0,The part of the earring that goes through the piercing is larger than the average earring and left my ear piercing extremely sore for three days
2.0,These pants do NOT look like the ones shown. Item was supposed to be extra long. These pants arent long at all they are extra wide at the legs and sag in the stradle way to much
2.0,poor quality and overpriced
2.0,i thought it would have the contrast stitching like the picture! but unfortunately it did not and it looked like cheap leather
2.0,"I liked the embroidery on the placket of this shirt, and the contrast on the collar, but it ended there.  The shirt is made of a very thin sheeting, practically see through, and will require an undershirt for daywear.  It is a slim cut shirt so take that into consideration when choosing a size.  This garment would be perfect for a costume with lederhosen, and it could transition into other costume designs...it has a flavor of India in its appeal as well.  But for an everyday wear, I couldn't recommend it.  Launders nicely, but requires an iron afterward.  The embroidery is appealing, well done, and a nice touch to the design of the garment."
2.0,"The thin black fake leather surround ""Fastener ring"" that holds the end excess piece is very cheap. It slides around like nothing, almost like just fake leather vinyl paper was folded into a ring somehow and they put it on. Very cheap."
2.0,Got it for girlfriend she said she liked it but hasent worn it yet so I guess that no
2.0,"1 came out the heart broken.. Then within days they rest popped out.. Gun, gun and more gun.. Not worth it.."
2.0,love the color. didn't fit my phone s7 too big
2.0,I had high hopes for this hat and wanted one for the longest and when I finally got it you have to do your best to shape it after one wear it went down heel from there. It do not hold it shape at all and it shipped  folded. For now on I will get my floppy hats from the store already shaped.
2.0,"I got this dress years ago through Groupon and haven't successfully worn it once.  Good thing they're through Amazon now, because when I bought a Transformer shirt directly from Von Vonni I was sent the wrong size and paid to returned it, but I had to get my credit card company involved to get a refund out of them! Too bad because the shirt was a cute idea and they don't seem to have it any more.  This dress is great in theory, but hard to execute well.<br /><br />Cons of this dress:  No bra allowed (note how flat the models are and how deep the plunge is).  In a lot of variations your back is bare to the crack and the sideboob is extreme. Thin wrinkle-prone material shows Everything, even the smoothest bra line.  There's a reason why this one runs cheaper than other versions on the market..."
2.0,the pink/red areas faded all over my hands. Otherwise worked to protect my hands/arms.
2.0,If you are looking for a childs watch...this is it. For an adult wrist...could barely wrap around. And yes...i have pretty small wrists lol
2.0,"I love the construction of this bracelet and design, but after wearing it for 1 week or 2, the cords at the end began to deteriate and un-ravel then ripped off completely. Tried to repair it on my own, but just looked horrible."
2.0,the stitch around the flower petals makes it look cheap
2.0,Cute. Sleeves are nice a long.  But shirt is kinda boxy.  The seams came apart after first wash.
2.0,Runs small and thin
2.0,don't expect anything resembling 1:1 on this item and consider it as one size fits &#34;most&#34;.
2.0,"This watch band did not come with pins or a tool to install pins.  This is the very first watch band I ever bought that did not come with the pins.  The watch band it is replacing had its pins sewn into the band for easy installation, therefore I could not reuse those pins with the new watch band.  I had to find some old pins which fortunately I had and was able to use, but I do not know if they are the appropriate length.  I am afraid they may be too short and that the pins will slip out of the watch rendering the watch band useless.  Make sure you have watch pins of the appropriate length before you buy this watch band."
2.0,"I loved the dress but it was too long for me.<br />I am 5-7"" and usually most the dresses fits me that one somehow didn’t.<br />Cheap fabric too."
2.0,"I ordered according to size chart and read the detailing of the skirt, however, when trying it on it was too small. The detail indicated there was elastic in the material....there is no elastic what so ever. I will be returning."
2.0,"I wouldn't recommend this product as it seems to come with poor batteries. The left shoe's lights remain on for 5min only while the right side keeps on for 1 hour, no matter how much time you've recharged both batteries. With that, my daughter gets angry that after a few minutes one of the sides' lights gets off so she's not using it anymore."
2.0,"There are plastic bands with the thinnest of leather veneers that peel off. Then the smaller loops just dry out and rip. It's good for a couple of months and looks nice, but it's low quality."
2.0,"Like: style, comfort, fit, durability<br />Dislikes : seller wouldnt fix their programs mistake on pricing (overcharged). But did have quick responses."
2.0,"The description said it fit as expected so I ordered the size I normally wear.  They were very very tight, to the point of being uncomfortable.  I returned them."
2.0,This is not a high quality stole. It is a wide single strip of ribbon.
2.0,"I should've listened to other reviewers, but I wanted a dress to feel good in. The material of the dress was very soft, and totally comfortable. My dress did have a weird side, where at one side of the dress was sewn together wrong, forming a sideways V shape. If you look at the other photos, you'll know what I'm talking about. My slits on the dress were uneven and the slit on the right was higher than the left. I wished the neckline of the dress stretched a little more like the photo above.... I usually wear a large, but when I order little things like this, I go to the biggest size. For this dress, the L was ok, but to have the dress look like the picture, I'd order a size up. Lastly, I did take the advice of others, and tied a knot in the front to try and even out the slits. Hope this helps."
2.0,"This is a super strange tank. The boob area while small, is loose?! And the material is thin. The pads in the breasts are also unflattering."
2.0,"Dry fit? This tank is not moisture wicking, there is nothing “dry” about it. I’m a welder and wanted an under shirt that would help keep the sweat rolling down my body. This slick shirt traps sweat, and all you feel is sweat dripping down your back, and chest. It fits as noted, if you want a nice tight fit so a size down. The tank stays tucked in, And fits good. However my expectations must have been to high....."
2.0,"I love the idea of these earrings, but they are dull-colored, and don't show up at all. I wish they sparkled in the light like real sterling silver, instead of a drab grey. I am disappointed. They are very fragile, so be careful when pulling them through your ears. I haven't broken mine, but that's probably because I don't really wear them since I don't think they're very pretty."
2.0,Leaves baby's clothes covered in blue fuzz!<br />What a mess!
2.0,I wear a size 14 orderd 3 XL!! Because reviews said runs small and they were still too small to even get up my thighs. AVOID
2.0,The arms are very tight. The shirt is not well made and it felt like it was plastic of some sort.
2.0,"The waistband is too compressive in comparison to the rest of the material, which if you don’t have washboard abs, makes your waist/hip area look really odd, it is almost too high waisted if you’re a short gal like me 5’2, the worst part of all is how unflattering they’re on the butt, they make it seem really flat, unibutt and square (because of the difference in compressions in the waistband vs all the other fabric). The material was kind of itchy, felt really cheap, and overall I really didn’t like them at all, I’m returning them. I’d say if you don’t care about how your butt looks while working out then they might be a good fit, however I think there are way better gymshark dupes (the wodowei gymshark dupes are great for example).<br /><br />In regards sizing, I’m normally an M, I sized down, and they were still kind of big and I’ll fitting. Would  not recomend them to be honest."
2.0,I wear an XL shirt and i ordered that size but it came small it looks more like a size medium than XL
2.0,Product description said solid back ...received it with a mesh back...ugh
2.0,very uncomfortable fit in mouth
2.0,These look ok and I thought they would be decent quality but only washing them a few times I already see tiny hole forming in the fabric.  They are not holding up to 1x a week washing and only lasted about 4-5 weeks (or 4-5 washings).  I won't purchase these again.
2.0,"I am 5'4, 125 lbs and ordered a Medium. The dress was way too long and came close to my knees. At first when I felt the material it was very rough and didn't feel well. After I tried it on, the material wasn't as bad but it is definitely a form fitting bodycon dress. I personally didn't think the dress did much for my body and it's not worth paying to get the dress shortened because it would also mess with the side split."
2.0,Cute dress.  Good price.  Nicely packaged. Terrible design. Criss-cross back will show the bra strap of any woman who wears a bra!  Very dumb design.  Hated to return it; but have to.
2.0,Ripped the first time worn
2.0,"Really nice hat but way too small. Must be nice for women or children, not big men,"
2.0,"watch beautiful but extremely difficult to set language, day and time."
2.0,The vest was too short.
2.0,One of the side pockets was sewn poorly so it does not hang properly on that side.
2.0,"OK quality, but I was hoping for a better quality, like that of an adult hat for toddlers. Disappointed."
2.0,"The fit is good and seems sturdy, but the details are terrible. They missed a reflector on the back boot and the other boot has the logo upside down. The top of the rubber is cut sloppily as well."
2.0,"Quality alpaca,  needs stronger elastic--always a challenge with male socks"
2.0,Buyer beware these only would fit kids up to 4yo. Very thin material.
2.0,Nice fit! It is very very very very thick fabric.  It looks nice but the thickness of the fabric will keep you warm in sub zero Antarctica. Not for a summer fall party.
2.0,Lightweight smooth fabric.
2.0,Don’t get them wet.
2.0,"Nothing wrong with watch or shipper however, the watch itself is cheap walmart watch for $6"
2.0,Pretty Color but the zipper is hard to zip it kept getting hung.
2.0,"Might have worked in a different size, but the small was unflattering on me, even though that’s my usual size at 5’2, 115 pounds. It fit very tight around the legs and kept riding up on top in the bust area and under the arms. The chest area was weird. Not great overall."
2.0,"Not shaped very well, either."
2.0,"Not attaching a picture because it'd show WAY too much; the fabric is comfortable and stretchy, but boy is it thin! Not sure where to get a nude sleeveless slip, but I'll have to get one if I ever plan to wear this."
2.0,The inside is soft and the pom-pom is soft and cute.  But it sheds all over and the band is very itchy.
2.0,It also had a tear in the back
2.0,very small.  not as pictured. disappointed!
2.0,My daughter  was so happy I was able to find this for her Halloween  costume. When it came in the mail it smelled and was beige in color not white. We didn't  return it because  we couldn't  find it anywhere  else.  It served its purpose that's  what really  matters
2.0,The necklace is pretty but it’s not worth the listed price.<br />The charm doesn’t have a gold stamp and it’s super thin.<br />The chain is flimsy but does have a gold stamp.<br />An authentication card came but it’s not specific for which piece.<br />I will purchase a sturdier chain because I do like the piece.<br />Overall it’s attractive but has no weight and flimsy.
2.0,"In my experience, Clark's run larger than other brands.  However, they do offer half-sizes where other usually do not.  This model sandal has an ankle strap fastener design which includes a clasp and a magnet which I found very awkward to use.  Also, the back of the heel platform has a sharp ridge which was uncomfortable."
2.0,"The ring(s) were bought for Bridesmaids. After wearing for less than 1 month - maybe 6 times, the plating on the band is gone.<br />To bad as it was a beautiful find."
2.0,To big for my grandson
2.0,"For an early fall wedding, I ordered several different colors and styles of this wrap.<br />I didn't like any of them. Rather than adding a pizzazz factor, they felt rather unattractive and not great quality.<br />I returned in favor of another."
2.0,"This dress looks pretty cheap. Accentuates things you don't want it to (back fat, arm fat). MIGHT be ok for smaller girls but the only thing I liked were the pockets"
2.0,"Lovely ring! My problem is after 2 days of owning it, 3 of the little stones fell out! Cheap! I'm not surprised, though... Fit perfectly"
2.0,"Really cool looking belt buckle for cheap.  However the built in lighter is a cheap piece of junk and BARELY creates even a spark.  If you're going to advertise a belt buckle/lighter at least make sure the lighter works properly.  If you buy this, buy for the look not the lighter.  I am guessing the other belt/lighters from this seller have the same issue."
2.0,"I did not even use it.  I could fit my passport in it.  But, my flight tickets, etc  would have to be folded to fit.  I was looking for something convenient.  Seems to be well made.  Would be better is it was a little taller to flight tickets without having to fold them."
2.0,This product fit too tightly in the material was very thin
2.0,This item runs very small!
2.0,"Right color and right size, but it was some white stuff on lower bottom that wouldn’t come off but it feel like doing through the hassle of mailing it back"
2.0,"Straps of these sandals were lined with plastic. This plastic layer was not sewn to the strap. the plastic was a separate sheath of material. Very irritating to the feet. The plastic sticks to your skin!! Very uncomfortable when worn. Returned the item. What  a process that was. The return address is an address in CHINA! I returned them to a return warehouse in Jamaica, NY instead."
2.0,"Poor quality product. I get another short same size, same brand, just different colour, and isn't fit okay."
2.0,Very bad quality!  If I saw them before I'd never bought them!!!
2.0,"I think these overalls probably would be cute on people they fit on. Unfortunately for me, no matter what size I purchased, I felt there was not enough material lengthwise. They were simply too short to get my torso into and get the straps over my shoulders without them riding up. I am 5'7"" and between 135-140lbs. Perhaps a smaller person could make them work."
2.0,"Material is thin, it's definitely a spring item."
2.0,Lot short than expected.  Wish it was 2-3 inches longer.
2.0,"This shirt was super cute, but it was way too big. I am 5'2"" and about 123 pounds, and I ordered a small. It was like a nice potato sack. I had to return it."
2.0,the material is bad the model is beatiful
2.0,The top fits good but the bottom is real big and looks bulky.
2.0,"I wound up returning this item. It was too long for me (5'0&#34; tall, B cup, 115lb). I still kind of busted through the top as well but the back is too large and started bunching behind my shoulders which showed off my bra (I was NOT expecting this). I love the material, it's nice and light, but wish it was fitted better for me. I returned the product."
2.0,This did not fit right. I'm large chested and where the straps  hit (even when adjusted) did not look good. The material is also fairly thin and cheep. Definitely not for me.
2.0,The sizing is cut way bigger than expected and the material is way thinner than i thought it would be
2.0,These are smaller than I thought but they remind me of dollar store glasses.
2.0,I can’t imagine this working well. I decided to return as I opened it because it’s so flimsy and doesn’t stay opened. I feel like it would have ended up being more to clean at the end. It is a great value but only if it works.
2.0,Pretty but couldn’t get it in.  Gave it away.
2.0,This umbrella is a a good sun protector. It is a bit heavy and hard to open and close.
2.0,It’s not high enough and don’t fit as I expected
2.0,"Nice colors, but are not anti-fog with a mask on"
2.0,feels like burlap
2.0,Fits too small. Love the look.
2.0,"These masks are well made and I like the way they conform to my face.  I think the average man would need the XL size, but my face is smaller than average.  I've heard they shrink in the laundry, so perhaps even I would need an XL after washing... we'll see.<br /><br />But the problem is this:  the cords holding the mask on my ears are thin and they dig into my skin.  It's really quite uncomfortable to wear the mask close to my face the way I want to wear it.  This forces me to choose between having a loose-fitting mask -- which provides unacceptable air filtration properties -- or considerable ear pain.  And I don't want to make that choice, so I'm not getting any more of these masks.<br /><br />If MarcellaModa were to change and use some wider/softer elastic for the ear loops their masks might be ideal.  If they make a switch, I'll give their new model a try."
2.0,"While this outfit is really cute (actually cuter than I expected once I saw it in person) the button on the pants came off the very first time I unsnapped it. I had no choice but to use it, since I bought it for my baby's first birthday party and we didn't have another outfit option, but his diaper was showing since I couldn't snap the pants shut. The fabric is a bit scratchy, too. Oh, and the &#34;pants&#34; are really more like shorts - wide and short. Overall, I'm not very pleased."
2.0,They fit pretty well and the shape is flattering but the fabric is obviously very cheap... I bought for my job where I need to dress business-professional but I'm embarrassed to wear these around my boss because they're obviously cheap and bought online and shipped overnight.... but missed the window to return so now they're just in my closet collecting dust..
2.0,I put three coats on my straw hat and three coats on my felt hat and it didn’t change the stiffness at all. Taking them to a hat repair shop instead.
2.0,"The ring itself is quite pretty but it is definitely not mother of pearl.  There is no iridescence to it,  it's just white."
2.0,"Bad quality, cheap, weird looking fish, stinky, off dimensions... smelled like fish.. just dawned on me that it smelled like fish,  and had fish on it. Please spend a little more money and remake this  sweater but do it well, with quality fabric and sewing; I’ll  buy a dozen of them."
2.0,Fabric is very soft
2.0,"Do not nuy them for winter time, these bandana are very thin, may be good for summer time, for a ride with a motorcicle...absolutely unusefull on winter"
2.0,"I ordered a size 36 but have a pant size of 34 and it is still small. The quality is good but not great, the stitching seems to be coming apart and the seller left the price tag on the belt which is less than half of what I paid. So I kind of feel ripped off"
2.0,I bought these for my Costa Rafael's and they where EXTREMELY hard to install! The material is also itchy around my neck when the glasses are hanging.
2.0,This pendant is super cute but the pendant fell off within a few weeks because the connector is way too thin.
2.0,"The leggings are a bit hard to put in, but once you manage it, they look awesome. Great tumy control and enough compression to run, jump or do any other activity in them. The color is nice too.<br /><br />Edit: After using the leggings several times they cracked and ripped on the back. The material doesn’t withhold stretching when one squats."
2.0,Me quedé pasmada al ver el tamaño. Son demasiado pequeños
2.0,The front is wrapped like a skort. Not what it looked like to me in the picture.
2.0,"The black dye comes off onto your skin, undergarments, and sheets. It fits a bit larger in the waist over what's shown in the photos. The fabric quality is thin and will not last long."
2.0,Not the same color as my rose gold watch. I was disappointed it looked a little cheap. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I like them a lot, I haven’t were them yet but they are very cute and in distance you can’t tell they are faux leather. I only dislike that they feel very light and they feel cheap when you touch them.<br /><br />Update: very comfortable<br />Update: I kept them in my closet and wore them during a vacation trip. I wore them three times and they were completely ruined just for walking, and not a lot of walking.  The peeled in the sides and the interior, so now they look as if they were 10 years old pair of sandals. They are unwearable cause you can see they. Are peeled from every angle.  Very bad quality."
2.0,"Hand wash only, very thin material, the neck slides down as soon as you put it on and strangles you. The fit is right and the color is good."
2.0,They work for a bit but if your child is super active they might slide down.
2.0,"The way the bow tie attaches isn't great.  Constantly slipping off to the point we had to safety pin it together to get it to stay.  Also, sizing was a little on the big side for our 3 year old"
2.0,I like the smaller size watch but the light only lights the side of the watch near the push button. Also the watch band is to small for a average size man’s wrist!! The watch is easy to read in sunlight. I think it’s a great watch for the money but need some corrections for fit.
2.0,"I couldn't get it out of the plastic package without ripping it. Smelled horribly of chemicals once I got it out. Material was very thin, like a dollar store poncho. I ended up throwing it straight in the trash. Would not consider it a rain coat for typical use."
2.0,"Set of 2 rompers size 6mo. They are very cute. I like the very different designs. Each is made of a different material..<br /><br />-The material is heavier on the elephant romper, than I had expected and very well made. I like the snaps at the bottom for ease of changing diapers. There should be snaps at the top as well for ease of putting this over babies head. The opening is small and tight, not stretchy enough for comfort of putting this on baby, IF it fits over baby's head.  I think this one will be a problem in that respect. The inside of the material is super soft. Softer than the outside because of the design.<br />-The material on the banana romper is a softer, lighter..not as heavy as the elephant one. There is more stretch to this one as well and may not pose as much as a problem putting it on baby, over his head. This one too has the snaps at the bottom for ease of diaper changing. And it could have used the snaps at the top but as I had mentioned, this romper is made from material that stretches better.<br /><br />Bottom line, they are nice, cute rompers that are made well except for the top opening.  I am concerned with the elephant romper. With the head opening so small, not stretchy enough and not having snaps, I don’t think that one will be used."
2.0,"These shoes look great and fit wonderfully! They're very comfortable and that's the only reason why I give 2 stars, otherwise it would be only 1 star. Minus 3 stars for durability. I've owned these shoes for less than 8 months, worn them maybe 10 times at most, if that. The sole is falling off on one of them."
2.0,Disappointed as the band broke after wearing for one week
2.0,"The case had a few things wrong with it. It’s a nice case but it does not fit the iPhone 8 Plus like it should. Well it fits, but that cutout for the Apple symbol on the back is off because the bottom of my apple gets cut off at the bottom. Also the pink rubber has seemed to absorbed the blue off my jeans. This is why I gave it two stars."
2.0,"It doesn't fit my band with the given items, used my old band. The band itself was still big for my wrist."
2.0,The dress I received looks nothing like the photo. It's more like a very long fitted tee shirt.
2.0,"Fit is fine.  Material is poor quality, may only last a year.  I'll be returning it."
2.0,"The package came horrible, if you are going to present it in a beautiful envelope, you need to put in a box in order to don't mess it up. Really disappointed."
2.0,"After washing knitted fabric became increasingly rough and worn-looking. Scratchy and unpleasant to the touch.<br />Two holes developed, one on each shoulder seam. This item isn't expensive, but still not worth half the $19 I paid."
2.0,Was not chlorine resistant. I am in the pool exercising 4 times a week with 4 different suits. This one is my Wednesday suit and after a few weeks it was faded considerably
2.0,"Overall fit is a little small. I wear a 38DDD and it was alittle tight. Was mostly disappointed in the packing. The shirt came shoved in a ripped open bag, covered in someone else's deodorant stains. Kinda gross!!"
2.0,"Got this for my child whom loves and adores sharks- any kind. Within a week of having it attached, I noticed the shark had fallen off. Shortly after, the tag.<br />Plus side- has a ring for keys..."
2.0,Received 4 instead of 5
2.0,"The necklace is okay as far as the style goes but after two wear the color is turning, I wouldn't so cheap again:(  Its not worth sending back."
2.0,"They are nice looking, average fitting sneakers, but they started falling apart within a month, compared to other brands that last many times as long. I have a lot of UA gear that I really like and is great quality, so I was VERY surprised when these shoes started falling apart so soon. Maybe it's just the pair I received."
2.0,Earrings did not come in with necklace.  Was wearing for an event this evening:(
2.0,The pin at the adjustment point will not hold the bracelet together.  Would be OK for a very lightweight watch.
2.0,"Have you ever tried on a bra that has been on a hanger at the store, and the straps are adjusted so small you can barely get it over your chest? That was this top for me. The arm holes are so small that I could not pull this over to cover me. My boobs were literally sticking out the bottom an inch. I laughed and considered a picture, but it was too inappropriate for a review. The bottoms fit cute. Sadly I have to return it.<br /><br />I am 5’3, 126lbs, 34 C and ordered a medium."
2.0,It's being returned. I'm 5'4&#34; and the inseam is way to high. I'm not big chested by any stretch in a C Cup and I couldn't cover enough so back it goes.
2.0,"Just ehh. The design is cool, but they run small and are really flimsy. My son hates them so really it was a waste of money."
2.0,button with charger fell off after a week.
2.0,"Arrived in a timely manner, but extremely small.  I ordered the xxl in case and they are too small.  I am a size 34 waist and the xxl do not fit at all.  Plus, it's cheap material and feels like a recycled paper.  I know they are priced cheap but just spend the extra dollars really and get the better ones.  Not worth it."
2.0,you can not use them to work on computer
2.0,I really wanted this dress to work. The embroidery elements looked really classy online. But when it arrived it’s quite cheap looking. The mesh that the embroidery is attached to it is not secure; the threads can be seen all over the place. When it arrived it had 2 gem stones completely detached and others nearly there. The coloring is more grape or egg plant rather than wine bread. That said the stress does look nice if your file way or in a dark room. Sucks to have to re-order one week before and hav The coloring is more grape or egg plant rather than wine red. That said the stress does look nice if your far away or in a dark room. Sucks to have to re-order one week before my event.
2.0,"The photo clearly shows all three circles turn, but the center one is actually made to be stationary and the metal is so cheap it broke when I tried to turn it. They refunded my money immediately and were very polite."
2.0,"The product looks decent, feels like a quality item but the flint broke after 2 weeks"
2.0,"ive had this band for a bout a month and the black is already wearing off for as much as it cost , you would think it would last better than a month"
2.0,"These cannot go in the tumble dryer.  That might work for some, but for me it is a real pain.  But the biggest problem is the stiff scratchy tags in the back of the top and the waistband of the bottoms."
2.0,Top part too small
2.0,Does not Roll well . Cheaply made
2.0,"It fit, but the length was much longer than expected."
2.0,Hasn't lasted long. Almost as if material thins out quick.
2.0,Soft but not a good fit. Also too long for medium.
2.0,"The material was very odd, no give and was a bit tight"
2.0,"The top fit as expected, but the bottoms seemed three sizes too small."
2.0,"fabric quality and fit was as expected, but the product i received was not the right color. the main color is a brick red and the accent color is a mustard yellow (see image)<br /><br />i bought these pants because i was looking for more brown to add to my wardrobe... guess i'll have to return them"
2.0,I like the looks of it but l would have liked it to have been a pair instead of just one
2.0,"The socks fit as expected, but the rubber on the bottom of the socks actually are painful when walking on hard wood floors :("
2.0,"Not lined, so it is very see through. Also fit rather small."
2.0,"2 out of the 4 pair came with multiple scratches on the lenses. Also, one of the pair came with a broken wire connecting the lenses. If they came undamaged, I would say they were worth the price. Quality is typical for cheap sunglasses that will get scratched up eventually."
2.0,Not very impressed. I should've expected an XXL to be big but DANG. This thing is massive. Don't buy anything larger then what you would normally wear as a shirt unless you want to go around life looking like a jedi with a short robe. The material is disappointing. It has a TON of loose threads even AFTER washing it per instructions. It's also not as soft as I would've expected. I did use white vinegar as well as wool balls to see if it helped but it didn't. We'll see how long it lasts but I don't have high expectations. I would not buy this again.
2.0,I've had the suitcases for 5 months. I use the medium more than the others.The zipper on the inside broke as what holds the clothes together inside. I had to tie it and the zipper broke on the inside when I was coming home from a trip.
2.0,"When it showed up it looked like it does in the picture. However, when my daughter wore it, it was very baggy. not tight fitting like a swimsuit should be. It fit up top and around the legs, so she can still wear it (we bought it for a Disney Vacation). However, luckily we wore this to play in the sprinklers in the yard, because the black dye from the swimsuit lining was dripping down her legs and had stained her whole body by the time we took it off. The dye came off of her body in the shower, but I will be spending the next few days trying to get the remaining dye out of the swimsuit before we take it out in public."
2.0,It is exactly quality for the price I tried this ones to do not have to buy the MAXIflex just waste of money
2.0,It looks great but the hook is to thick which won't allow the window to close right.<br />**Can't be used in rain<br />**Can't be used in snow<br />**In my car because it's not closed all the way you can hear the air.<br /><br />If those are not issues for you it's a great looking product.
2.0,"I ordered this jumpsuit in my usual size: medium. I am 5'4"" and 125lbs for reference. The jumpsuit was cute and made of a nice material, but ultimately made for someone much taller than myself. The bottom of the jumpsuit dragged on the floor.<br /><br />Since it could not be worn without alterations, which I didn’t plan on paying for, I decided to return the item. I was surprised to learn that after returning the item, they did not issue a full refund. Instead they charge a substantial restocking fee even though the item is listed as having ""free returns"". If you order this, make sure you plan to keep it or know there is a chance you will not receive a full refund."
2.0,not the best material for a hoodie.
2.0,"1st: 60/40 Cotton Poly not 100% of either. You still burn like a torch if exposed to fire.<br />PROS:<br />Well made.<br />Thigh pockets are deep and have slots for two magazines each.<br />CONS:<br />Jeans style pockets.  You can not get anything in or out with an equipment belt on.<br />Velcro closure on the thigh pockets and the one calf pocket.  Good Velcro that makes a loud ripping noise every time you try and access these pockets, very tactical &#60;/sarc&#62;.<br />No flaps on  the other pockets (hips and two extra front pockets).  Stuff falls out and dirt gets in.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Would not recommend."
2.0,The waste band was not as thick and not as much tummy control as I had hoped. They are not as thick as o though which was. Good thing. Very comfortable to workout in .
2.0,The coating on one of the inside lenses came damaged.For almost 200$ I expected more
2.0,"The little dog charm is so sharp along the edges of the dog, it caught on my sweater so many times , I had to take it off my link braclet, very disappointed.  Thank You  Linda L Haselhuhn"
2.0,"the rubber for behind your ear came off when i first tried it on. it doesn't sit on my face probably a bit twisted to the right. guess the saying is true, cheap thing not good and good thing not cheap."
2.0,Super cute but antlers broke pretty easily should be secured to headband a bit better
2.0,"Product came on time and looks as described in the pictures. I ordered the navy cherry blossom robe for my wife.  The size is slightly bigger than I thought it would be but the number one concern was that after wearing it twice, the silk piece that ties the top of the kimono together to hold it in place broke off.  It wasn’t some substantial amount of force, but was very loosely stitched together, and I can’t imagine that it was stitched with silk or it wouldn’t have broken. For the price, I would have expected significantly better quality.  Also most other places which say they have 100% silk products generally tell you which type of silk they are using or which blend of silks.  It also doesn’t appear to be hand printed.  Maybe the original patter was painted by hand, but this product does not appear to be, but please correct me if I’m wrong."
2.0,"DISAPPOINTED :( Tags on both shirts were super sticky n stuck together=I had to rip shirt tags to seperate shirts! Residue from tag stickers being removed, then replaced? 🤔<br />The womens shirt is so completely off on shape/form=neck is ridiculous!<br />These shirts are not a actual set either, thus not really ""matching"" and the lettering looks worse out, not in a stylish way. Bad print?<br />Men's shirt runs big.<br />Shipping time was accurate"
2.0,Cute necklace and idea. But it is a cheep plastic type chain the the &#34;globe&#34; is plastic also. I would just go to the craft store and. It the supplies  supplies and make your own
2.0,I was not what I was hoping for.
2.0,The set was ok but not great.  The tie was so long we had to purchase a different one.  Its so long that it was too long for my adult husband.  That was the main reason for purchasing the set.  Disappointed.
2.0,TINY. Pretty but too small. This is made for only a child. I have thin wrists but no way could I get this on. I’ll save it to give away as a child’s gift.
2.0,Broke on Tues first wearing.  Had to fix it.
2.0,This is a heavy watch.
2.0,sadly it arived broken :(
2.0,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. This shirt is pretty shapeless. I'm also not a huge fan of the long sides. They definitely extended quite a bit longer than what I expected. I will probably wear it, but it won't be the first shirt I pull out of the closet."
2.0,Closure kinds sucks - lots of extra bracelet that hangs off my arms when I tighten it. It’s<br />Also hard to tighten in your own. You need three hands
2.0,"Value for money is ridiculous, it a piece of plastic, no sound or lights. It is covered in glue or something dried and looks cheap. The strap broke within minute of my son playing with it.<br />Waste of money."
2.0,The was not made properly
2.0,Snap won't stay closed.
2.0,"While the pattern was cute, the top was too short for me, and the shoulders wouldn't stay down. The material was pretty cheap. I returned this item."
2.0,Midsection does not fit in the appropriate place. Sized disproportionately.
2.0,The band looks nice but the tool sent to remove links was warped from the start. I had one of my own but pins were very hard to remove. I verified the direction to push pins out but that was not the issue. What normally takes a few minutes turned into hours. And I bent four push pins in the process. I have never had a problem like that.After the band was sized I had problems with the latch closing. The band came unfastened multiple times. I was very dissapointed. I would return it but I don’t have any more pins to put the links I removed. Not a fan.
2.0,"the time it took was a little long, but when i finally got them the backs of the studs where smashed and when i slightly straighten them it almost snap off. i am very sadden because i was excited to finally have and wear them."
2.0,"The wallet was very pretty and did look just like the picture, but the odor was so bad I had to return it.  It smelled toxic.  I even left it out for a couple of days but the smell was still very strong.  What is it made out of?  Sorry, I wanted to like it."
2.0,This was cute but way to big.
2.0,"Makes you look like a box. No fit to waist as all, make u look 3 sizes bigger. Comfy and well made but no fit at all very strait sides."
2.0,The ear rings are cheap plastic with flaking glod paint. The eyepatchs are hard plastic that wouldn't be comfortable for anyone to wear at all. I'm working on making the hat less ridged because no one could wear this hard circle
2.0,Bracelet looks better in the picture..
2.0,Shrunk after first wash and those strings can be annoying at times
2.0,The fabric was great but it definitely runs small.  Go for at least 1 size larger than you'd normally wear.
2.0,"It's cute and flexible but I've had it on my phone for about 3 weeks, had one small drop and already cracked my screen. So kind of pointless."
2.0,"Like others have said, the dolphins keep falling off and it wobbles so much that it makes a very annoying clacking sound.  Also, the covers for the battery compartment constantly fall off, and it takes 4 AA batteries, not one 9 volt."
2.0,We liked these shoes just fine until they caused a terrible rash on my sons ankles a few days into wearing them. Now anytime we put them on the rash flares up. My guess is it's something they treated or stained the leather with.
2.0,The treading on the sleeve ravel out  in less than two wear
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed in the fit and quality of this top.  First of all, I normally wear mediums in everything but I recommend sizing up in this.  I wanted it to fit like the photo, but its much smaller than that.  I'm 5'-7&#34;, 160 lbs and the medium fit tight - to fit like the modeled photo I would def need a large. Second, the construction of this top is sloppy and poor.  The little strings connecting either side of the fabric around the opening in the arms, is attached with string that is fraying and coming undone.  There are strings everywhere.  I will cut some of them back myself, but one string was completely detached.  I will have to try sew it back myself.  Overall, not worth the hassle to return it so I'll try to fix it... Idk if I'll ever wear it tho"
2.0,Too tight in the calf area makes these things impossible to get on and off. Cute pattern. Does fade after sitting outside in the sun.
2.0,"This suit looks exactly as pictured and is seriously adorable, but the bottoms did not hold up very well at all.  First, they are high waisted which looks super cute, but they kept rolling down for my daughter once they were wet.  My daughter wore it for a day at a water park and another day at the beach and by then the shiny green part on the back was totally worn off and was black instead of green.  Also, it was very much see through so she could no longer wear the suit."
2.0,"The shirt is great, except the seashells are mostly white, not purple glitter as pictured.  IT looks like it's all fallen off before arriving!"
2.0,It got the job done for the most part. Easily falls apart. And the lights could potentially give someone a seizure. Had to staple the mask for it to keep its shape
2.0,"Runs very very small, it looked like it could fit a babydoll"
2.0,a bit small for my noggin.
2.0,It's just ok. Would not order another.
2.0,"These pants may be fine for a very large lady. However, I did return them and would like my money back. Thank you."
2.0,"Looked great for a while, unfortunately it broke after a few uses from flexing the arms to put it on/off."
2.0,"It was a gift for my daughter it wasn't what she expected. she said it fits like a sack. looks nothing like the picture and  , material looks soft but in real its not, maybe i didn't read or see the fabric type.so was a waste buy."
2.0,Not as nice as the photo and a little small.
2.0,Absolutely love the design and they are lightweight. Here comes the but…I was not able to use them because as soon as I delicately tried to put them on one of the broke in half. I wish I could’ve worn them at least once. Because I truly love how beautiful they are.
2.0,"I like the idea and design of this face mask. There are good and bad about this product. The face mask does cover the nose and mouth, it is easy to breathe in, it does not fog up eye glasses. The bad about it is that the straps on the face mask did not connect on one end so the straps will not stay on making it impossible to wear the mask. So I had to staple the straps on the end where it didn't connect so the straps can stay on and then I'm able to use the face mask. The 2 vents on the face mask will not block dust, germs, viruses, bacteria, wind, water or anything. But this product came with 2 filters for the vents so then it can block everything from getting in and out the mask. But it only came with 2 filters so you will need to buy more which they are easy to find. This mask is very comfortable to wear. It would be the PERFECT task mask if the straps would connect and if the vents was able to block things."
2.0,The insert came out after one wear.  Cute concept but I found these to be of poor quality.
2.0,The product quality is fine but not great
2.0,"This top came with a tiny piece of the tag left attached in the inside, looking like it was removed by someone before it shipped. The product was thinner and lower quality than I anticipated, and it looks like it might not be new. Just strange to receive with half of the tag removed if the product is supposed to be new."
2.0,This is soooooo cute.  My daughter looked adorable.  However it was cheaply made & literally within 2 mins of her sitting on the porch etc the shine on the bottom had rubbed off.  You get what u pay for.
2.0,Two rhinestones were missing from the purse the first time I used it
2.0,"I had high expectations for this spray, especially since it’s $19 for such a small bottle. I typically use 3M Scotch spray but decided to try this on my wife’s newly purchased Timberlands. When applying the spray from the recommended 8 inches, I noticed the stream wasn’t very uniform. So every spray resulted in half of it being wasted in the air and the rest being blotched onto the boots. *Be careful and spray this stuff outside, when the spray gets on the carpet it creates a sticky wet surface*. Once the spray started drying I noticed the areas that the spray concentrated were blotchy, and the worst part is it dried like that and created a worn look to the boot...the directions recommend to use a blow dryer for best results which I find ridiculous. All in all, this an overpriced hassle of a product and I regret spraying it on our boots.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it still protects against the elements, but at what cost?"
2.0,Is more white than photo
2.0,"The MEDIUM is TOO LARGE! They began the lettering so far down on the shirt that the word ""CAT"" is lost below my belt. I'm going to attempt to return."
2.0,It's really not that comfortable. It's not supportive either. I am a 36 C/D and I couldn't wear it out of the house. Plus it has these weird foam cups.
2.0,This dress was cheap and runs very small
2.0,"Comfy but not made well at all. Stitching is badly done and as soon as I washed it, much of the threading came lose. Fine for boating and the dock but would not wear this to the pool."
2.0,"Love the color, feel, fabric; however, it doesn't stay up reliably over my nose. It keeps slipping down. The only way to stay up is to pull it up in the back as well as the front, which means tucking long hair underneath. Not practical."
2.0,"Disappointed. I wanted to get something without a bunch of strong chemicals, but it just doesn't clean at all. I tried cleaning several pieces of jewlery (not all together) and I could barely notice a change."
2.0,"Material felt cheap and the dress was very short. The hem was well above my ankles. The sizing was accurate, but if you're tall skip this one."
2.0,Tacky and cheaply made.
2.0,The print on this sweatshirt is very faded and small. You can barley make out the Muppet characters on the sweatshirt. I returned this item.
2.0,Fell apart on the first day
2.0,"I bought this because the shape looked like something that wouldn't show bra line, unlike a lot of pushup bras where you can see the top seam. It definitely shows through. Not only does it show, but it's lumpy! The lighter top piece is very thin compared to the darker padded area, and the result is that both parts show through my blouses making it look like I've got that quadraboob thing when you wear a bra that is a couple cup sizes too small."
2.0,Doesn't look 14k. More rose gold. Cute but not the gold tone I expected.
2.0,WASTEN OF MONEY
2.0,"They are no inclusions like in the picture, and the qmber doesn't look like Amber, it looks  more like melted plastic. The gold plated doesn't look like gold either,  it looks more like bronze."
2.0,"The bands are not large enough for an adult male,  and apparently the manufacturer does not produce a larger size."
2.0,not a fan... they're super cute design and made well but WAY bigger and heavier than I anticipated
2.0,"Very thin, not a winter cardigan. Ordered as a gift, wish they would have mentioned it was so thin."
2.0,Quedo muy pequeño
2.0,I umbrella is NOT SECURE
2.0,Item is bulky and necklaces kept coming undone at the clasp and they still constantly tangled.
2.0,"Nope, just nope. Got these thinking I could wear them casual around the house and not look like I was in slippers but the look cartoonish and awful. A case of too good to be true for the price."
2.0,Didn't look like the picture n the website. Disappointed.
2.0,"Although the product is very cute and loved by all to have it, it falls apart within weeks of wearing. I have purchased seven of them for my Grand Kids......all fell apart or are very frayed. The balls on end simply fall off. The construction of this product is horrible."
2.0,whote is see thru and fit was not flattering
2.0,Nice soft material but too loose on back
2.0,"Bought for my teenage son who has to wear a tie on game days to school. While I’ve had previous great experience with similar product for my older son, this one was toast after one wear. Bummed"
2.0,pros:<br /><br />does protect from the sun.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- There are tons of small threads that are sticking out. I ordered it once and I thought that I got a defective one. Submitted return. Returned ( paid for return a lot).<br />- Ordered new one. Nothing changed. Decided to keep because returning would be way to expensive.<br />- It is quite expensive for what it is.<br /><br />Wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,Almost impossible to get in ears.
2.0,Straps way too long for me
2.0,"My daughter loved the shoes, but the charger for them stopped working after only a couple of uses. The return window had expired so now we have to charge them with our phone chargers."
2.0,"I AM HEARTBROKEN!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE EVERYTHING about this dress - Wore it once fit perfect, wore is a second time and the under arms - both sides- split open. I was about to order a second color today so I am very upset and wouldn't recommend this dress :("
2.0,"I thought it would be a small pendent that would hang nicely from the chain, but it's big and I'm not happy."
2.0,"Bought this item for my boyfriend as a gift, definitely expected to be at least 22in as description states but when he tried it on it looks almost like a choker 16-18in. Now I have to search for a longer Cuban link 22in looks great thou just too short"
2.0,"I first ordered these for my daughter a few weeks ago in a size 10. She's currently wearing size 10 shoes and still has a little way to go before she outgrows them.<br />The size 10 was too small and even with her trying them on they left indents.<br />We really wanted these to work so we returned them and went to order another pair, but they skip from toddler shoes size 10 to big kid shoes size 1. We ordered them anyway because they were for a costume and figured we could give them away after,  however,  they fell apart!<br />They didn't even last a couple of days of house play before the strap that holds the ankle pieces on,  just fell off.<br />The glitter is already coming off and there's a scuff on the shoe.<br />We have carpet everywhere in our house so this makes no sense.<br />They are not holding up and I'm glad we didn't try and trick or treat with these."
2.0,"Nice color; full tassels, lightweight. Unfortunately not thought out as to design, as the bottom portion is always sliding off center of the chain it's attached to; also not pleased with these being hung by a post. Recommend getting the hook through ear, rather than a post earring."
2.0,It does look cute. There is nothing wrong with that….<br /><br />It fell apart on the second that I was using it.<br /><br />I was hoping I could fix it but I just didn’t find the time yet so it’s just sitting on a shelf. 
2.0,Perhaps it's just my ears but the post wasn't long enough for me.  They are cute and I wanted to wear these as my bed earring because without a back they wouldn't snag but they hurt my lobes too much.
2.0,"This hat is so bulky and I was bummed out that it didn’t look better. But it was cheap, so I guess I shouldn’t have had such high expectations."
2.0,"The description says seamless, when it arrived it’s clearly the opposite. Cant even get the thing to go over my head because it’s so small. The seam is not even elastic or stretchy material so that I can get it over my head. Not pleased at all. Cant believe I bought 2 of them."
2.0,"It's a cool design, but the rubber rings that surround the earrings keep falling off.  I just took them off completely, but they just don't look that great without them."
2.0,"Visor was bent, however, I am keeping it as I can wear it in cold weather, it covers my whole head"
2.0,Battery when dead
2.0,The choker is neat but there's nothing leather about it. Two 👍🏼👍🏼s up for cuteness. 👎🏼down for not being leather.
2.0,"The socks fit fine, but they smell like oil.  Even after I washed them, they still have an odor like automotive oil...yucky :(  I would have returned them but because I removed the packaging & washed them (hoping they'd freshen up), I'll keep them.  I don't think I'll order this brand again."
2.0,Recommend save up for a better one.
2.0,"These Capri pants fit great and I was really happy with them when I first got them. I am 5'0'' and weigh 173 lbs and order the 4x.<br /><br />Pros:They are very soft and comfortable to wear. The waist band does not roll or cut.<br /><br />Cons:  They are thin and see thru even with dark panties, you need to wear a long shirt and cover rear.  I've only worn them three or four times and the black pair have small holes in the thighs.  I don't think I would order these again."
2.0,Es muy frágil se rompió el cierre cuando lo puse siento que no duro nada
2.0,If u plus in the thighs and have african american butt. Not for your shape
2.0,Fibers were tight and semi sleek like polyester
2.0,Broke after wearing for 2 days.
2.0,The most beautiful part of the dress (shoulder) did not look like the real dress. It's a nice dress but it doesn't settled on my shoulders like in the picture
2.0,"The shirt is a nice light weight material and unique in appearance.  The zipper side pocket is not very practical but looks good.  The big drawback is the fit.  In XXL size, the shirt will not fit any person larger than 38 inch waist.  The size designation XXL is very misleading."
2.0,These ran very short and we had to return them.
2.0,"Material isn't a t-shirt, not like what I had expected. Kind of silky.. and it's basically see through. I had high hopes for this shirt. I also am returning it because it's body hugging. I ordered the XL and it was just too small. Tight in all the wrong places. And it smelled like B.O!! Returning."
2.0,These are not short plugs. They look long and skinny. Not what it looked like in the picture
2.0,Not the best quality and I did get a 2x - so the image looks a lot smaller.
2.0,"Looks much nicer in the picture than what was delivered. If you want a beach cover-up, this will work, but don't expect anything to wear to a pool party."
2.0,Ribbon wasnt attached very well. Not flat all the way around. Hat on top was smashed up abit
2.0,"Very see through when stretched the tiniest bit. I bent down to tie my shoe and you could see straight through them! Also, the pattern is just on the surface so when stretched it turns white. Very noticeable! They are comfortable and fit well but I will not wear them in public!"
2.0,"I bought a small just to ensure it would fit like the photo, and it is still baggy. It annoys me when sellers do this, but I guess I should've known. If you want a formal fit, it won't be this shirt. The only upside is that it is thin and works for the beach or walking around in the summer."
2.0,Works and fits over my wrist. The blue started scratching off from the magnet after the first use though. It’s silver under the blue paint.
2.0,This top runs small. Not quite as long as I expected. Would have returned but they would only give me $5 back. Wasn’t worth returning.
2.0,"look better on picture, somehow too big for the ears"
2.0,"super thin fabric. almost see thru. seems like it wouldn't even make it thru the washing machine! also, it was very small!!"
2.0,"Came in the mail super quick, but unfortunately it came missing a little detail on the side :/ was really looking forward to taking on my trip next week.."
2.0,This is a poplin fabric. It will wrinkle. It has the crispness of bedsheets. It's got a.sort of 70s/80s business woman vibe. Not what I was personal looking for in a summer short.
2.0,Very thin and stiff.
2.0,This is a great suit. Sadly it runs really really small. Would order again in a different size.
2.0,Not satisfied.....layers separate very easy
2.0,"10 of the 40 finger lights did not work. :-( I can replace the batteries, but the batteries cost more than the finger lights to begin wth."
2.0,"This is very, very thin. Color is cute as well as design but this shouldn't even be considered a jacket. LBVS"
2.0,I got an XL. It fits my sister who’s a medium usually. It’s at least 3 sizes too small!!!!
2.0,The Quality is not that well and the sizes are NOT true to size.  I would not recommend purchasing this item at all
2.0,"I was looking for a sound board that could play one SINGLE track every time you press a button. What this does is play EVERY sound track on the TF card. I can't imagine how that would really be useful. The sound is pretty good hence the 2 stars, but really this thing is useless"
2.0,"ugh, it's so uncomfortable. The material used keeps it from draping the body correctly. I returned mine, too cheap looking."
2.0,"I really love the look & size of this watch BUT I quickly discovered that the part that holds the band in place, doesn't stay put. It kept moving off of the band. It comes off really easily so I'm afraid that it's going to just fall off when I wear it. Wish it worked because I really do like the look of it!"
2.0,Ordered a 2X for my XL frame so it would be extra long and snugly this fall- it's a medium fit.<br />This is the kind of crap you get when you order from Wish!
2.0,"These are cute and shiny like the picture, but won't stay put as crawlers. I wouldn't recommend if you want crawlers."
2.0,"I order these quite often (lots of them) and found that the ones that's packaged in the hand cardboard works better.  I purchased 10 pks of the 40 and over 30% of them didn't work.  Because they were so cheap, I didn't send them all back.  Instead I ordered the packages of 48 which came packaged in sets of 4 and they seem to all be working.  The kids and adults all love them.  Note that this rating is for the bulk packaged finger lights ONLY since so many of them did not work"
2.0,"These fit a size or 2 bigger. Unfortunately for me, there is no XS so I don’t know if these would fit well if I went a size down"
2.0,"Super cute dress but it was too large! I normally wear a “large” and based of sizing but the arms were too long and the length was below my knee making me appear short than I already am. The material is nice - sketchy, breathable!"
2.0,"Too expensive for this, my"
2.0,Can't adjust at all and when trying to put on some broke completely in half.
2.0,"ok for the price, ok for a child stones were off set."
2.0,"I should have read the reviews and description better.  These are very pretty colors, but they run a little small and do not have a cotton crotch!  What's with that?"
2.0,"I have this necklace it's really pretty but one of my stones in the center was missing when I got it. N i thru out the information to returns u have nbeen t wore it, very disappointed."
2.0,Jewel fall off easily
2.0,smaller than a dime.  for infants.  couldn't even put on ears. sorry
2.0,"Edit:<br />So I've had there for about a month and a half now. On top of the fact that 3 didn't screw on properly, I've had 3 balls break. 2 of them broke while I had it in. I felt something after I finished eating and when I pulled it out, it was the bottom ball. I picked it out and it fell apart in my hand. The 3rd one I noticed a crack from the hole to the center and that one fell apart. I know they were cheap, but I didn't think they would fall apart like that. Luckily I didn't swallow the bar and other ball when it broke!!!<br /><br />Well, what do you expect for $6.00?! I ended up with 6 that have skull and crossbones. And 3 don't screw on properly. I guess 23 that are good isn't too bad. I tried all to make sure the balls screw on OK. I had ordered the flexible ones several years ago and had the same issue. I have a lot of metal bars with acrylic balls, but the plastic is more gentle on teeth and I don't have to worry about taking it out every time I have an X-ray or MRI. Will edit my review if there are any more issues!"
2.0,"Not as expected based off the product images.<br /><br />I am 5’9” 170 lbs and usually wear a 10-12 jeans and medium/large shirts. After reading all the reviews I decided to go with a size Large.<br /><br />Neckline was not as deep of a cut as shown, and the hem ended 4-5” off the ground. The material seemed comfortable but there were enough things about this dress that didn’t seem to match the images that I’m returning."
2.0,I was super excited to receive this shirt but the screen printing on the shirt had smudges throughout the graphics. The shirt is really soft so I think I might try to exchange
2.0,A lot shorter length than picture depicts. Four or more inches shorter. I am barely 5'4.
2.0,This shirt was very inexpensive  and I should have expected the quality to reflect the price. I usually wear a medium and ordered an XL based on other purchaser reviews. It was like a mini dress. It flared out at a strange place and fit really awkwardly. I wanted to love it but will be taking it to goodwill.
2.0,Broke in 3 weeks.
2.0,"These were great, but only for one use. They fell apart immediately after when I tried to reuse.<br />The sticky tape works better than fashion tape so I’ll keep those."
2.0,"The quality appears to be very good, but it is VERY small. Either the one I received was mislabeled or the “Large” is for a non-American context. I am not fat, but 6’3” and with Hanes or Fruit of the Loom pajamas of similar style a large is a perfect fit. The bottoms in this set were as tight as biker shorts.<br /><br />And no, I will not provide a photo."
2.0,"These boots stink, they smell like dead fish. The overwhelming terrible smell made us all feel ill. The white ""fur"" fabric cuffs are not hemmed. They unravel and shed at the bottom. The black soles leave marks on the floor and furniture just walking normally. They are not even slightly waterproof or water resistant. On the plus side, they do fit, they are cute, they are easy to put on and are comfortable, but all the cons at this price point make it difficult to recommend these boots."
2.0,Bought this for my daughter she loved it until her first time in the water with the suit and the underwire started rusting and she had lots of rust spots all over the top..so we returned the suit
2.0,"Wore 3 hours for a costume, glued straps came after 2 hours."
2.0,It is beautiful but then it turn black and leaves black residue/ stain in my wrist. I don't even wear it to the shower . It didn't even last a full week. I guess I should have known since it was pretty cheap
2.0,"Shirt was shorter than I expected, and the bottoms run small"
2.0,"Somewhat Large, I returned it!!!!!"
2.0,It may have been my mistake for not reading the measurements but this looks like a tie bar for a toddler.
2.0,It worked great for two months but the base stopped charging and it is now useless. Very disappointing.
2.0,Should be advertised the watch face is not included
2.0,"These were too small for my 2nd ear lobe piercing.  Closing them was very difficult and the way I had to hold and apply pressure made my ears bleed and become inflamed and painful for a week.  Once in, they were fine.  While sleeping I didn't even know they were there.  Very comfortable to wear.  Durable and nice looking."
2.0,"The fit is good, a bit on the big side though. The material is very thin and cheap feeling and the color is not as it appears. It's very pink and more of a dusty rose."
2.0,"It’s very pretty. Unfortunately, it broke the first time I wore it."
2.0,The color was off-white. I expected white color.
2.0,The sunglasses were crooked and broke within 2 weeks of me having them...a screw fell out and now the glasses are practically useless.
2.0,Odd looking tank. Compression ok. I'll give them to the Salvation Army.
2.0,"For a long time, I've used a pair of $1 flip flops for the shower that have worked wonderfully. When those fell apart, I finally decided to get a longer lasting type of shower shoe. I'm typically about a size 10.5 (for things like ski boots and skates I tend to be closer to a 10) I decided to get a size 11 for these because of the sizing recommendations, and they're too small. These shoes fit snugly on my feet, but my toes are a little too big for the fronts and I cant easily slide them on or off to wash my feet in the shower. The logo on the side is glued on crooked and sloppily, and they have small divots that collect water. Overall, I'm not impressed and would not recommend."
2.0,"I ordered this bra because the Parfait brand fits me well and it looked cute in the photo. Unfortunately, what I received was a bra that was far smaller than the measurements, by at least one band size and two cup sizes. The overall construction felt a little cheap, but it made sense that this bra was in the sub-$30 price point, and I was a little disappointed that the only color available in my size (32G) was bright pink.<br />If you wanted to give this bra a shot, I'd recommend ordering at least a size up to see if that fits for you. Again, this bra was super cute on the hanger, it was just way too small."
2.0,"One word .... flimsy. Its cute but thats all, no purpose for these."
2.0,"Your child has to step thru the neck straps and into the bathing suit to get this on. Unfortunately the next straps are really small and don't stretch much so my child cant even pull it over her legs to get it on. She has 2 other swim suits by Delia girls and they fit fine, its just the way the neck straps are designed on this that makes it impossible to get on. Also they heart on the front is made of sequins which makes it kinda hard (like the feeling of cardboard) my daughter wasn't thrilled with that.  All in all this suit is poorly designed and I would not recommend it. I'm returning."
2.0,"I waited too long to send this back.  This is definitely not one size fits all/most.  And I'm not huge, I promise you."
2.0,Cheap s***. Wore it out in two weeks. Eyelet pulled out belt streached
2.0,pretty but too delicate and tight the tried to open little to put on and  the stem broke
2.0,"The combination of colors is killer. It feels well made too. I bought this 6 months ago for my SUV key fobs. However, after about half a dozen uses, the screw broke off. I personally would recommend this now but it's possible my experience was a one off thing."
2.0,Just received it today... different color and it’s crew neck.. nothing like in the picture ..Dissapointing !!!
2.0,way too small couldn't even get it over my head and I bought a bigger size so it would be loose
2.0,Fits ok. No pockets
2.0,Fit too snug for my wife's preference. These are really form fitting.
2.0,I would love these if they didn’t have a completely unnecessary thick strip of elastic around the top of the waist band. It doesn’t even fill the entire waist band and it makes them very unflattering. It is also impossible to remove the band because it is securely sewn in.
2.0,I ordered an XL because that’s all that was left in the pink color and it was huge! When I tried it on I felt like I was wearing one of my grandma’s night gowns. I ended up returning it.
2.0,"This was a nice bag, not perfect, but good enough for regular use. It was big enough for my laptop and it had an outside for my phone which was usable, but a 1/4"" to short to zip it up.  It looks nice.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on it, but it has one MAJOR flaw.  The zipper on the largest compart stopped working after just a few months.  As fast as you zip it up, it comes unzipped behind you.  I nursed it along briefly, but now it doesn't work at all.  This is a game changer for me.  I'll have to replace it and throw away the money I spent on it."
2.0,Cheaply made: weak springs and bev holder very thin that can bend easily. The buckle is solid.
2.0,"Seems nice but sleeves are very short. Selected regular length sleeves but it's borderline a Tanktop. Unfortunately I missed the deadline to do a free exchange by a couple weeks because I forgot, so that's on me."
2.0,Women's small was smaller than a Junior's small. They are not using the standard size chart.
2.0,Not even like picture. It's ugly
2.0,Cheap handle. Ruins the entire bag.
2.0,"This was a beautiful kimono very lightweight for a summer day.  However, the sizing was way off. I am a size 14, lrg / x-lrg so I ordered a large. I would’ve preferred something with a more close fit and this just didn’t do it for me. This felt like more of a drape and would’ve been cumbersome to keep on my shoulders. I’m returning it for a small."
2.0,"Cute print, but fabric is not soft. Makes me itch."
2.0,I found the socks to be hard to get on and since I have a problem with my knee I couldn't use any force to get them past my ankle. I loved to color and butterfly design but sad that they don't work for a heavier person.
2.0,"It smells like it was in a wet space, it smells like mildew that is why I have to give it 2 stars....."
2.0,"I've recently lost 80 lbs and weigh 150. I bought two pairs, one grey and one blue. They're both pretty thin and don't offer my tummy pooch any support. They're ok for lounging but not any form of strenuous exercise aka jumping. If you do need some support I would say to purchase a more expensive leggings with actual tummy support."
2.0,"The necklace looks exactly as is pictured. It did not come in the bag advertised though and did not come with extra pieces for repairs. I was surprised how light it was and now realize there is not any metal in the necklace. However, I do like the way it looks so I will continue to wear it until it breaks. It's inexpensive so you get what you pay for. I have gotten a couple of compliments already. It's a nice pop of color."
2.0,Terrible design. Fits a bit awkward. Fits my girlfriend better than me. But it's very ugly
2.0,Was not as advertised
2.0,"Shirt was too big. If you are going to order one of these shirt, I recommend you order a smaller size of your regular size"
2.0,"I have a big head, but these headbands are hella big."
2.0,It came kind of beat up already and it wasn’t worth paying the shipping to send it back. Guess it will have to do.
2.0,The rhinestones came off easily.
2.0,"Very tight, very short"
2.0,"This cap is more pink than red, despite description. Returned."
2.0,I didn’t want to trust the reviews but it’s true that what was depicted in the picture is very different than the actual product especially at the most important part... the collar and buttons. The real product looks so cheap and the stitching/buttons look like a children’s sewing project.
2.0,"This watch is wicked cute. But it losses a minute or so every hour, so by the end of the day it’s way behind. Then in the morning, it’ll have stopped overnight. Will try replacing the battery. The band is also cheaply made (I understand I paid $8 for it so what did I expect). Each time I put it on I feel like it is going to rip. I attempted to contact the seller before posting this review, but did not find any contact information."
2.0,Love the watch buy it stopped working after 2 months
2.0,I loved it and so did the grandkids until it broke. 2 days layers here I’m ordering another one . Hope it here before Christmas
2.0,"I had high hopes for this dress, based on the reviews.  When I received it, however, it felt cheap, like it was 100% polyester.  There were threads hanging that needed to be clipped.  I bought one size larger than I normally do in dresses like this, but this one fits skin tight- literally like a sausage casing on me.  And it's not actually tie-dyed, it's a weird fake printed pattern.  All-in-all, it's just piece of junk."
2.0,I'm 5'5 and 140 lbs this sits at my waist line. The picture shows it being much longer. I got a large. The sleeves fit but are too short. Only by this if you are tiny.
2.0,Runs big.  Had to return
2.0,"I bought these socks because I loved the colors. I bought them with me on vacation and wore the first pair on my first day. Unfortunately by the end of the day, my socks already had tiny holes by the toe which makes me think the material is cheap. Very disappointing since I really liked the look of the socks."
2.0,"Very small and poorly made, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,It sheds everywhere
2.0,"Cheap chain, oxidized in two days. Get a better chain. The pendant was nice but the chain is crap."
2.0,Not flattering on me! Didn’t like at all on me.
2.0,Cheap looking decal on case.
2.0,Too bad the cap is not made to fit adults.  Great looking cap and appears to be well constructed.  It is one of the smallest caps I have ever seen!!  I’ll give it to my 4 year old. Hopefully it will fit him for a few years.  Rediculous!!
2.0,Size too small.  Pictures quality not the best for the price
2.0,Great idea but a very long wait to receive them
2.0,Fits as expected but REALLY thin for Peds brand was disappointed
2.0,Zipper broke after 2nd use
2.0,Way too small. I didn’t want huge ones but I wanted average/medium sized ones and these are too small. I also think the color is  slightly off. I will probably return.
2.0,Nose bridge piece fell off. Ear cushions fell off. Other parts are durable. No scratches on lenses. Made my eyes hurt initially but got adjusted to tint. Not for everyday use. I've had these a few months. 1 1/2 stars!
2.0,"Awkward fit, but will I still wear to sleep."
2.0,"The segment on this piece doesn't fit flush and creates uncomfortable seams.  Also, even though the picture shows a pair, these are sold individually."
2.0,The product works well but the bottle leaks.
2.0,"I love the style and fit of this dress, very comfortable. I even ordered 2 of them, BUT....the circular pattern on front is also on the back and looks like a bullseye right on my backside. I can't imagine any woman would want to wear that! And because of that.... how did the designer not realize this when they were  Selecting this fabric? If you are Reading this and want to order this dress, don't order the &#34;bullseye&#34; print and stick to the solid fabrics!"
2.0,"I think the colors are great and I have three to choose from. The comfort is okay, but it seems that for my wrist, the band is either too tight or too loose. If it's very hot, you will have sweat underneath the band. It will definitely  be very short for a man's wrist. Another issue for me is that I just cannot put on the band without it coming off the clasp every single time. The clasp is the same material as the band (some sort of rubber) and not metal. It doesn't secure the band in place while you're putting it on.  I wish it was metal. It's an okay purchase for the price, but I wouldn't buy again."
2.0,"These are a nice suspender for an average size man. I am not of average size, so I did return them."
2.0,Wouldn't fit around my forearm
2.0,So tight. Painful in the ear region
2.0,The apron is made out of some kind of odd fabric and has no washing instructions attached.  It also has pretty short strings to go around the waist so it may not fit if you're overweight.  I almost sent it back but don't know how to send something back to China.
2.0,I was very disappointed when I got this mask. It looks nothing like the picture. It has no sparkles on it- it’s just cloth-
2.0,Shirt has no give to it at all. Very stiff .
2.0,The chains have all broken. Have not been able to wear them.
2.0,Nice quality but ran way too small and I had to return. I got an XL and it was small but a L in a diff brand and it fit fine.
2.0,I loved this charm when I got it but the white sapphire already fell off. Very disappointed. I wear this bracelet everyday and have other charms that have faired much better.
2.0,"Quality is good, but the scent of this medicated sport not lecklace reeks like battery acid. Literally.. Makes me nauseated"
2.0,"Based on the photo I thought this would be the ideal flowy summer sundress, but in reality it was very strange. The material was thick and weirdly textured. The elastic on the sleeves was tight and uncomfortable, and there was also strange elastic on the sides of the neck, which I assume had something to do with the puffed sleeves, but it just made the v-neck end up forming a weird shape. When I tried it on, my husband compared it to something a plain and conservative religious group would wear. (I returned it, if you couldn't tell.)"
2.0,"I used this wallet after having issues with the &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; Bellroy wallet. It's nice, if you only want to take 3 or 4 cards with you and nothing else.<br /><br />There is no secure way to hold bills in this wallet, so be prepared to have them fall out when you open it. Unzipping the wallet around adults made me feel like a child in professional environments, I also ended up stuffing my cards and money into my pocket as I didn't have time to zip and unzip the wallet after making a purchase.<br /><br />The leather wore in extremely fast, and also made me wonder about how the cards are held inside, as there is a very defined inch line at the bottom of the wallet where nothing goes, maybe it's for change? Also the metal emblem is VERY out of place, and catches on things. There is a leather slit on the inside that may be for a key, but mine wasn't opened beyond the leather being cut, so if something was to go in there it couldn't.<br /><br />After having 2 Bellroy wallets, I will no longer be buying anything from this company."
2.0,Used for about 2 weeks before the lanyard piece completely fell out of the metal attachment.
2.0,The term &#34;Cushioned&#34; is a broad term.  I bought these socks for playing golf and hoped they would be &#34;thicker&#34;.
2.0,"It says polarized, I was doubtful and I was correct, not polarized. Not terrible for $9, considering I drop my glasses about every bike ride."
2.0,Maybe when I lose a little weight I’ll wear it
2.0,"While the dress fit, something in the way the pockets were stitched made the, stick out so strangely that I couldn’t wear this dress.  The pattern was expected and I didn’t mind the fabric.  Too bad."
2.0,These were extremely hard to put on. They were also very tight so if your feet are already swollen they will be even harder. Once on they do keep your feet warm but just to tight for me.
2.0,The fit was okay but the material was not what I was expecting. It has more of a  lingerie type material feel. Will be returning it.
2.0,Always happy with your products.  Wasn't crazy about fit or material<br />I will continue to order from this company
2.0,My daughter didn’t care for the hoodie fabric.  It’s not comfortable.  The pattern was cool though.
2.0,"Ran a little small but the problem was the petals on the bottoms flipped over and/or stuck out funny. The top fit great, but had to return because of the bottoms"
2.0,They run pretty small...definitely want to size up 1-2 sizes. Disappointed because I think these are so cute!!
2.0,"I ordered 2xl...  way too small.  You will have to wear a shirt underneath this one, it's so thin and see-thru.  Totally disappointed.<br />Will give it away to someone who is very tiny...."
2.0,Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. See through. Poor seams.
2.0,Earring doesn’t really close and constantly falling out since it’s always open.
2.0,Broke a week later..
2.0,the material feels like paper--my son didn't like them at all.  not soft and comfy like he wanted
2.0,the bill on this hat is about 10 feet long
2.0,This product is very thin and too small for my head  (Men's 7.5 inch hat size)
2.0,"Product fits and feels ok but the Chemical smell was so strong it took several washings to get it to a smell you could stand to wear it. Be aware tags say you cannot put the garment in the dryer, and need to hang to dry."
2.0,Way too big for my small head even with use of the internal size adjuster
2.0,"Love Duluth products, but these seem gimmicky. A basic t shirt that shrinks like crazy and seems no different compared to other basic brands. Just over priced. Wasted my money on these."
2.0,Cheap material and  has a very narrow fit. Definitely not for thick sisters..
2.0,The slipper is absolutely perfect except that it is HUMONGOUS! The size on the slipper is 44-45 which equates to a men's size 11-12. The selection pulldown should show the sizing that is listed on the shoe. I ordered a women's 10.5-11 which should be a 41-42 in standard euro sizing. Add to the fact that these run way large... so these are going to my neighbor. I'm not sending back a $10 item. But beware. Comfy though...
2.0,Quality has decreased dramatically from where it used to be a few years.  Messy seams and not true squares.
2.0,It was too floppy. I mean really floppy.
2.0,See through. Waist band is much smaller than the rest of the pants... sizing is off
2.0,"I like the way the first one I purchased for, and decided to purchase another one. This one, the wires aren’t long enough and they shift. The fabric is also different and loose."
2.0,"I had very high hopes for these pants as I work outside for a living and need a durable pair of pants. I was very pleased when I opened them based on initial looks and feel. They fit great when I put them on. I'm a loose 38 and they felt good. First impression on the zipper pockets it felt like they were not sewn in correctly and they were difficult to zip up but I let that go. First day I wore these I actually came home and put 3 more pairs in my amazon cart to order after including a black pair to wear at home... unfortunately after two more days of wearing them the truth started to emerge, stitching started to come undone, I noticed the fly zipper was very cheap and the pull kept getting turned around which made it very difficult to pull it up, the back pocket button already is missing and the final straw was when I took the pants off today I noticed my belt clip actually wore a hole through not only the pant material but also the fleece. It's a great design if you work in an office but want to look like a guy that actually works for a living, but they are under no circumstances durable or military grade. I will unfortunately not be purchasing the other 3 pairs I had in my cart. Great styling but horrible choice of materials. They need actual canvas, metal buttons,  rugged stitching and heavier gauge zippers."
2.0,Well took forever to receive  And then I had ordered 2 of them for gifts. One is crooked and you can see heavy glue on its sides under glass drop
2.0,Awkward fit. Maybe for teenager with no curve yet. Color is better in real life.
2.0,I would not buy this shirt for myself again. It's is more of a tight fit not flattering at all and the material is see through with very little stretch. I was very disappointed. I have only worn it once and don't plan to wear it again.
2.0,I like the size and the dark lenses.<br />I did not like one of the nose pieces coming off just one or two months after purchase. Makes them seem cheap.
2.0,To small !<br />Even if it would have fit my chest The neck halter tie is so short you would have to pin it just to make sure it wouldn't come on dune .<br />Fabric of the suit its self is of nice thick swim spandex However the fringe is frayed and not cut even at all<br /> I received this item for free or at a discounted price for my Honest opinion
2.0,Uncomfortable.  During the night I take it off because I find it on the floor in the morning.
2.0,"My son loves another style of shoe that he has from this company, so I was hoping these would work too. They're too high for him (almost like high tops) and look weird with socks but his feet got sweaty in the minute it took for him to try them on. I would recommend getting the T-strap style instead."
2.0,Doesn’t look like the image and is impossible to put on. I’m really disappointed.
2.0,Jacket is much shorter than the picture depicts. It only comes to mid thigh.
2.0,"Just received this in the mail. Lots of loose strings, no big deal, I burn them down with a lighter and then I saw the flag/logo upside down. I would return this if there wasn't coronavirus everywhere. I would not buy this again."
2.0,"The material is beautiful, but too small in the waist and too much material around the bust.  I wanted to send it back, but discovered the international postage was more expensive than the cost of the dress itself.  Disappointed."
2.0,"This bra was and is a REALLY GOOD CONCEPT however; it was and is poorly executed. The stitches are very loosely stitched, there were several pieces of thread dangling from various places on the bras. I thought it was just a forgivable fluke in the set I received until I sent that set back for a larger size ( which was STILL wrong ) and that set was the same way. I originally ordered XL but that was apparently too small because the zippers kept coming down. I sent this exact and ordered a 2XL. Now, the packaging said 2XL but 2hen I opened them, all 3 bras were a 3XL!! I was like, that size wasn't even an option when I places the order so how is it they sent.... nevermind. I tried one on ( dangling thread from various places and all ) saying to myself "" yeah, it's too big but since they're adjustable maybe they could work. I washed all three and the following day I wore one to work. About midway into my shift the back piece began to feel a little weird. Fast forward... I get home and prepare to shower. Y'all when I took that bra off it was hanging on by a literal thread!!! Well 2 threads if I am being exact. I was sooo glad it didn't pop the LAST 2 threads!!! I So to make a long story even longer lol, they were NO GOOD to me nor for me. If you purchase them, hopefully you will have much better luck. Again,  the concept was good but the execution was very poor."
2.0,"looks good, but band fell off the 2nd time I wore it.  sells for more money at disney world, but not good quality"
2.0,"I do like the style of this dress, but I was informed while I was wearing it that it's completely see-through when in daylight or under a strong light. Everyone at work saw my underwear. -_- Very disappointed."
2.0,Very small top
2.0,To me it seemed too much like I was wearing a sheet that was turned into a duster. Colors & lightweight material were great but no collar. I think that ruined it for me personally. Maybe it was just didn't fit me how I thought it would.
2.0,Don't buy unless you're sure of your size. They don't offer free return or exchange. $10+ to return.
2.0,"I ordered a large which I usually get, I’m a medium/large. It ran super small on my sister whose a large and small on my mom who’s a medium. Go up TWO sizes for a proper fit. How disappointing. It’s cute just unwearable."
2.0,Disappointing to return this. Color not as vibrant as I expected and fit was weird.<br />Light weight material.
2.0,"Was too small and too itchy. I gave it to my great-grandmother. I don't think she even uses it. Didn't seem to be too bad of quality, however. Not my cup of tea, maybe someone else's."
2.0,Putting the glasses in for the first time the rubber arm pulled off making the head strap unsecure.  Completely unacceptable.  Add some super glue or something
2.0,"This outfit is adorable and will serve its purpose, however, I find it absolutely ridiculous that an infant outfit says it should be professionally dry cleaned. Who has time to dry clean baby clothes??!! Had I known that ahead of ordering, I likely would have changed my mind."
2.0,"Runs very small in my opinion.  If you want a looser look like the photo portrays, order 2 sizes up.  I ordered a medium which is my usual size and what was recommend.  It was very snug.  Returned it."
2.0,"All 10 noses were shoved in a little box.  All the noses are misshapen because of this.  We got 1 to fluff up and stay on my daughter’s nose.  The others hopefully will eventually fluff up, but it’s not looking good."
2.0,Jacket is too narrow on the shoulders and chest.<br />Pockets are poorly designed bucket pockets.<br />Material and lining is quite good.<br />Not a good fit for tall people.
2.0,They don't hang right get stuck constantly
2.0,Beautiful but the mechanics holding them on to the ear is very flimsy. Does not stay on at all. Be very careful.
2.0,Wife bought for herself - Very thin dry leather that was pale compared to photo. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,Band runs very big and you can’t adjust to small wrist. Then the band fell apart cause screws came undone and to small to find when they fell out
2.0,Magnet doesn't hold bills
2.0,"Blah costume... didn't fit well at all,  cheap material had to send it back...I see what they were going for but they didn't quite get there"
2.0,The material is not good and its not true to size just like a lot of bras.
2.0,Material and stitching are cheap and poorly executed. I would expect this out of a $10 dress not at >$25.
2.0,Kept this ring only because I loved the design.  The plating was a mess leaving bits and pieces between that were jagged and snagged on clothes.  I broke the pieces off with some pliers and tried sanding them down. Bringing me to the second thing... this is plated over copper not brass.. I got the ring thinking it would wear to a more golden color. The plating is starting to wear off but the pink of the copper is showing through.
2.0,This is an okay hat of you don't wash it.  The decals and logo are just pressed on so they start to peel and come off of you wash the hat.
2.0,I normally wear M in pants and this pants fit rather loose. Seams look very bad on the inside of the leg and material is shiny and see-through. I have worn it to mild exercise and it got wet very quick.
2.0,This dress looked really cheap. It was really short..... I returned it.
2.0,"I should have ordered a 2xx,  very pretty blouse, still need it."
2.0,Little  disappointing. Size runs small even for petite. Photo was a little misleading. Fabric is not as substantial as it appeared. Would not buy another.
2.0,This one broke too.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Disappointed.
2.0,Hardy used it and worked for about two weeks.
2.0,"It was only okay. The vest was not exactly as shown in the pics & the glasses were made for a small toddler, not possible for an adult to wear. The earrings & headband were cute, but not worth keeping for those two items"
2.0,(Husband is model.)<br />This sweater is so cute in the pictures but definitely not the same sweater you receive. It’s somewhat comfy and it fit oversized but at the bottom it didn’t fit oversized on me. It was a weird shape. Would’ve kept it if it was cheaper but I can definitely buy a quality sweater for 37$. RETURN.
2.0,they don't even provide a cord or a key chain at least.
2.0,Very comfortable bke but after a few weeks the band kept popping out.
2.0,"They worked for about 2 hours. After walking on grass wearing heels for two hours, one of them broke."
2.0,"You probably will never see this review because the product is overrun with reviews from those that got it for free. I was suckered by these reviews and, unfortunately, only got a bag that lasted 45 days. In addition to showing questionable wear after very light usage, the zipper on the back broke.<br /><br />I think I now know why I can't find any mention of the company anywhere on the internet. It's poorly made junk by a nonexistent company."
2.0,"These really didn't work for me.  They didn't hold up well, didn't create any lift at all (more of a flattening effect), and looked super weird under a tulle bridesmaid dress.  I threw them out."
2.0,This dress is so thin you can see completely thru it.
2.0,These earrings are way too tgin and tend to really bother my ear holes.  I had to buy a different brand that was more sturdy and didn't bother my ears.
2.0,It’s cute and comfy if you don’t mind everyone being able to count your freckles under it. It’s very see through. I had to buy a long tank top to wear under it.
2.0,Was way to small for my 16 year old even though it clearly says teen sizing. Sent it back and got a refund.
2.0,The necklace started turning black in a couple spots after only a couple weeks.
2.0,Very see through!
2.0,The fake pearl is HUGE!! Looks ridiculous. 3xs the size that's in the pic.
2.0,The white pair has missing little dots. It is a good variety but the quality is poor. Not leather!
2.0,I'm a size 6 in everything! But this shoe was way to small but the shoe is toooooo precious to give up on.  Ordering a 6.5 next.
2.0,can read with glasses but just a blurr looking forward walking or driving no good
2.0,"I love the color and it arrived in perfect condition whenever UPS delivers my orders are never brought to my address but either returned? Or in the front office where I seldom have time between going to treatments to stop in so make sure who is bringing your package in this area..the FedEx is awesome,and has brought my packages to my front door as I specified in detailed request .so thank you to those who do that. For I'm still waiting on a different package that the UPS Hasn't delivered that says delivered but is not,, in regards to this package and bathing suit.. I am a tall 160 pound 5""8 1/2 in.  tall women, I usually wear small to medium bottoms and large tops as I have more up top than bottom ..but though I was worried about the bottoms being to large they happily fit me perfect as for the bikini top, it was and can be hard to adjust (I wear a 36C bra cup) so though it fits.. it takes some working on the back string tie to get it adjusted, if your swimming as I was, I had to keep adjusting the top as to not flash others.. I also didn't want nor like the padding which I took out this is just my personal preference.. so perhaps another would ..in general it's a beautiful suit and I look forward to wearing it again ...** A heads up ( the top is more a yellow than the coral or orange I expected) but still a lovely suit."
2.0,"The material is very thin and shirt is super clingy, returned"
2.0,Color was not right
2.0,"Although it looks great and the sizing was perfect, quality was very poor. Upon opening the case, a nut from one of the screws which held the lens fell off. It was too tiny to twist back in so I just super glued it back. I figured no one could tell the difference anyway. That lasted about a month and then the nut from the opposite lens came undone as well. This time I was out in public and could not locate where it landed. In summary, looks great but very, very poor construction."
2.0,I like the cut and color of the robe but it came with a hole in it! I kept it because I had already worn it. Perhaps the company should either issue a refund or send their customers a replacement
2.0,The fabric in this dress is really thin. Cheaply made and doesn’t drape like in the photo.
2.0,Cute shoes and look as pictured but they have a very strong smell that won’t go away! If anyone has any tips on how to get rid of the smell please let me know.
2.0,"not bad for kid glasses...son liked the design, but stated that they were a little tight on his face."
2.0,These glasses are OK for used part time they are lightweight.<br />The sunglasses has these tiny screws to hold the them in place they always fall out.<br />I would buy these glasses again if they were cheaper.
2.0,"This is not real leather. It is a form of pleather. It doesn't even smell or act like leather. As it was a gift, I cannot return it, although I would if I could. If customer doesn't want real leather, fine. Just do not advertise as leather."
2.0,Very disappointed in the necklace and the way it was made. I don't see it holding up vs. typical competitive items. The worst thing was that the paint was 3/4 worn off and looks terrible. So I bought it and now won't wear it. Too much of a pain to return.
2.0,"Bought this shirt for the beach, but it is better suited for someone with a slim build."
2.0,"The picture and the description of the skirt appeared to be exactly what I wanted,  yet once received it was too small, too lightweight as if it would not last through a washing and most importantly it was way above the ankle , I am 5 feet I needed something ankle length. I'm sure others would appreciate the skirt it just was not what I thought it would be."
2.0,"Definitely jot the dress that's in everyone's reviews. It's not a wrap dress, but rather a one piece with a.slit and a.fabric belt attached. I'm not sure how I feel about it-will probably return."
2.0,These things rip so easily.<br /><br />I made one athletic movement and it ripped top to bottom.<br /><br />Cargo shorts are meant for duribility and work. These do not fit the bill
2.0,Not a good fit said 2x definitely runs small
2.0,Not as I expected but it could be a fluke.
2.0,"Such a cute idea, but it is of poor quality material. The bottom puffs out from the top at an unflattering angle and the bottom looks like mosquito netting."
2.0,"These fit my old garmin Fenix 2 - not my new one, so ""compatible"" is pretty subjective."
2.0,The dress for great but the white is completely see through!
2.0,It was cute while it lasted but broke after 2 weeks. The clasp failed. Would not recommend to buy if you want something that lasts.
2.0,I purchased this bag when I received the bag it had a really bad odor to it. I had to let it air out for a couple of days. The bag itself is a ok bag. I noticed that if you do not have enough items in the bag it will flop down on its side. So the smell and it does not stay upward if its not enough items in the bag.
2.0,"liked the fabric, despite the sizes listed they run smaller"
2.0,I wish it had a clasp like the original. It just has a button to hold the strap in the desired position
2.0,"wish I could be more positive, this dress in particular  is so striking in picture.  the fabric is the slick stuff, good weight, not see-thru. well-made, but it has a rubbery feeling because of a too-high % of spandex.<br />biggest disappointment,  the color  is actually a pale aqua background, nothing near the intense blue in pic.  the neck is way too high.  while closer than most china-doll sizing, it does run skimpy small  around the bust, neck and shoulders.  the length is not skimpy.  at 5'5"" it hits just above knee, definitely long enough to be worn as a dress."
2.0,"Not a quality sports bra. First, the material is more like a swimsuit and has a neoprene feel. There is almost no stretch to any part of the bra- especially the band. When I first put it on I heard so many threads snapping as it stretched. Because there’s little stretch, the straps bunch up instead of laying flat. The worst part was the stitching on the inner band was rough and incredibly itchy. I had to add a bandage under the band to protect my skin after only an hour or so of wear."
2.0,"Wallet zipper busted off within a few months, wristlet  shredded in 2 pieces. Would not purchase again."
2.0,The chain faded very quickly and turned like a dark brown.
2.0,these are super cute but the insert that is very soft and cozy is uncomfortable on the inside and every time the foot comes out or you take the shoes off it slides.
2.0,"Fit well, was a bit small. No stretch. Thin material. Got discolored quickly."
2.0,Not a big fan of the sleeves. I would not recommend this top for women with an athletic build.
2.0,"Fabric and colors are adorable. But there is no official front and back so it is awkward fitting. Not really 3/4 sleeve, but too short for long sleeve. Low cut swoop neckline for for t and back."
2.0,The boot itself looked cute - especially for the price. It seemed to be nice and cozy as well. The problem was the fit. The opening was simply too narrow to comfortably put on. It was really small even with sizing up as suggested.
2.0,With the weight of a 1911 this shirt pulls hard to the side and makes it's collar look completely distorted.
2.0,Very cheap material. The elastic is in a weird spot and the verticals lines ect don’t match up. Definitely get what you pay for here. Would not re order.
2.0,"Ok, I really loved these for two days, I mean I really loved them! But I could tell they were not the best quality... Then the unexpected happened... The lens popped out and they broke! I was so upset! These really are pretty sunglasses! I would like to find another pair just like these, only I would like a pair that wont break on me!"
2.0,So let’s start with a positive first I really like these shirts they’re super comfortable they are nice and stretchy they’re really cute I like the lace around them no problem before I even put the shirt on I looked at them and there are holes where the lace in the fabric are connected so it’s very poor quality in my opinion and if they can fix this problem then I would love to buy more but I’m not going to spend my money on products that are kind of come to me being unfinished or having poor quality
2.0,"Blackburn rack only, well the description says it'll work on any rack it won't only specific racks that have a narrow mounting strips to wrap the tiedowns  around. The second feeling of this morning system is that every time you want to mount you have to reach underneath the rack where your tires probably dirty in the bottom of the bag is probably dirty so it's not easy to take on and off of the rack which may be a benefit if you're going to leave it on all the time.<br /> Otherwise it's it seems to be a really nice waterproof bag with waterproof zippers with the with the zippers protected with a zipper garage on the side pocket and a flap over the top opening in the magnetical downs for the dry bag style top.<br />Unfortunately due to the restriction of mounting it wouldn't fit on any my bikes  so it is getting returned"
2.0,They were very small and the stones didn’t have a good shine to them
2.0,"These are made of heavy material, the waist band is very small and legs are huge. I’ll be returning these."
2.0,The quality was not good. The fur was faded and not has full as the description
2.0,I ordered the 3x and it's been hard to get in to.  Material is nice but the soft cups move around too much
2.0,Very cheaply made. Zipper gets stuck and runs Small
2.0,the fit is awkard.  The print is pretty but the material also did not feel good on the skin
2.0,"The zipper is not good quality. Pant material is, but the fit is awkward. Need to size down. Runs large and pants are long. I suggest sizing down."
2.0,they came undone very very fast
2.0,I received the wrong product.
2.0,"Prime shipping is a joke currently, but there is a pandemic so I think I'm okay waiting a few extra days. Perfect sizing and very cute. However,  the inlay is basically puzzle peices and isn't held together well. I'll have to take them apart and reassemble them with a better adhesive before the peices are lost."
2.0,"Just got this today and washed it to put in my hospital bag for delivery and it already is falling apart. Although the material is very soft, So i still gave  this a 2 star."
2.0,Super cute but sadly I did notice that someone the diamonds are falling off.
2.0,Only giving two stars. The baiting suit fits perfectly but arrived ripped. I’m super bummed I bought this for my vacation and now I won’t even be able to wear it.
2.0,"The fabric is very thin and the straps are difficult to adjust. It’s okay, it’s not great."
2.0,I love the fabric and the fact that it can be customized in so many looks but I cannot get through a day without adding a stain. I’ve tried several removers. Nothing helps. I won’t be ordering again unless I get some suggestion on how to keep it from staining.
2.0,Rings are small but not bad not like picture thought it would be bigger and chains are way too short now i have to go find a long enough chain for saturday great .
2.0,"I loved this purse.... for the first few weeks.  It is great size.  It is cute.  You can put a lot of stuff in there.  It can fit nicely on your shoulder without the long strap or just resting on your arm.  But after only about a month, it started getting a small hole in the side of the bag.  I do not put a lot of wear and tear on my purses as I use them probably 2 - 3 times a week since I commute to work via public transit and use a messenger bag on the bus.  When I do use them, they typically sit on some sort of surface (i.e. car seat, table, purse hook, etc).  It doesn't get put on the rough ground so it should be easy to keep the product in good shape.  If this had just a bit better quality, I would love this bag."
2.0,Very cheap made! Very thin and tears easily
2.0,"These earrings are as pictured and look cute.  I bought them for my 9-year-old and they were an appropriate size for her.  Unfortunately, they're much too tight.  She complained immediately that they hurt.  I adjusted them and, liking the look, she claimed they were better.  But within a few minutes, both earlobes were an angry red.  She's too young to suffer for fashion. Back they went."
2.0,I had purchased this jersey for my Grandson. The size was perfect and well made.
2.0,It's small but I think I'm ordering another pair of pants from you.thanks a million
2.0,"The ""one size fits all"" didn't fit. Too much strap, too few holes. Didn't know what to do with the extra leather. It was too long and the holes were too close, so did not match up. nice product, couldn't use it."
2.0,"sloppy, unsupported.  Waaaay too large,  fall off my feet all the time.  Not Good.  Would send them back, but have had them too long."
2.0,Cute... this pjs fit true to size. It is stiff not a soft material not very comfortable.
2.0,"Cute, but cheaply made. Granddaughter loved it but broke in a day. She loved it and was devastated."
2.0,Item came late(not blaming sender) and broken.<br />The stud on one of the gauges was bent and the end(alien backing) was completely broken off while still in the bubble wrap.
2.0,"Fabric is see-through when you bend over.  I’ll go back to my lululemon.  You get what you pay for, I guess"
2.0,"I washed these and it turns out the pockets were glued rather than sewn in. I like them well enough to fix them, but it’s really obnoxious to have to do that."
2.0,"This cloth is advertised as being 12"" x 15"".....it is two smaller pieces of cloth sewn together in the middle.  I had planned to use this cloth as a drawer liner for my silver jewelry, which of course won't work with a big seam down the middle.  So, beware.  It does polish, though not spectacularly.  I'd look for a better cloth."
2.0,"These are very heavy. If you’re looking for light weight, these are not it."
2.0,This item broke the VERY first time I wore it. The whole thing came completely unraveled and fell apart. Very poorly made. So disappointing.<br /><br />Although I cannot change my rating on this item (because It was poorly made) I have to say that I am satisfied that the seller issued a FULL Refund. That's good business in my book. :)
2.0,To wear in the evening
2.0,Way too small. Lightweight material though!
2.0,These run incredibly small. What is labeled as an XL (which according to the sizing table should be size 16) is more like a medium or size 12. You can return them but you won't have shipping refunded and the cost to return them will be deducted from the refund. What should have been $42 overalls cost me about $15 for the privilege of trying them on.
2.0,size not as expected.
2.0,"Adorable, but too big. The onesie was also very wide and was not proportionate to the length. The hat was sized for a Newborn, not a 9 month old. Between the outfit itself being too big and the hat being too small, I wasn’t satisfied."
2.0,Really liked the style but was just too small.  Color of item received is different from picture.  Picture is lighter shade than actual item I received.  Ordered size I normally wear but is too small.
2.0,I like them a lot but are a tad bit on the small size. Plus one pair ripped when I put them on for the first time.
2.0,Too short wasted.
2.0,Its looks like a coat but a flemsy paper jacket
2.0,"We also had the zipper issue. Looks great, fit great but the zipper pretty much just falls out."
2.0,Sizes are way smaller...my 5x was equivalent to a usual 3x.
2.0,"Cute stylish idea of a choker but not a choker. It's a normal necklace length, at the tightest setting is isnt tight around my neck as a choker should be. The stars are also a really thin metal, and feels cheap.<br /><br />The way they are attached to the chains of the necklace are by thin eyes of the stars. They are bound to break.<br /><br />Cute idea lack of quality."
2.0,Don't waste your money these are junk. Three of them don't work two of them the band clips are broken .
2.0,I bought these bc they claim to be compression tank tops. There is no compression what so ever. It is just a basic tank top
2.0,"Shorts are okay, but the top is uncomfortable, it's not a true tank top, the back does not scoop, however I have a lot up top so someone with less cleavage might find it comfortable"
2.0,The hat is adorable. It is super soft. However I am very disappointed since the shape is so bent up. It was shipped in a bag with nothing to hold the shape. I don't think it will ever look like a normal cowgirl hat. I will be returning it.
2.0,"I bought this for a planed trip that I didn't take.  I really should have tried it on when I first received it because I would have returned it but now it's to late.  It's not that its bad quality, it's just not for me.  The material is a heavier than I expected and it is cut a little big with a very low neck line.  I do like that it has some stretch to it.  Since I am unable to return it, I will try to make it work by adding a thick belt to pull it in some, a bright bandeau top and heals."
2.0,I am returning the Ladies Drawstring Linen Pants for two reasons.  I chose these for the fabric; something light and breezy to wear to the dog park on hot days.  I wanted them loose-fitting so I bought the Large - they are a LOT bigger than anticipated.  Second reason I am returning is that what I received were BANDED CUFF LEGS.  The photograph are OPEN legs -- incorrect advertisement.<br /><br />I do not like the banded cuffs at all and I would NOT have ordered this item if the photo depicted the actual item that I received.  I do not feel I should be charged the re-stocking fee for their advertising error.  We'll see what happens I guess.
2.0,Disappointed the zipper separates from teeth. It can be zipped back together but I find it frustrating. It's a nice bag.
2.0,This was not flattering. I immediately returned it. I'm a small person and it made me look very bulky.
2.0,there is almost no opening for the actual ashes to be held
2.0,"I liked the product, but it was way bigger then the sizing suggested."
2.0,"I wanted to love this bra, I really did!  This is not a good bra for large breasted women - it just fits super weird, even to the point of it being awkward.  Pre-preggers, I was a 36DDD/F, but since becoming pregnant, I'm a 38DDD/F (measuring according to the Kindred website), so I purchased the XL Busty as suggested.  The cups are just....so weird.  For some reason, I'm bulging out in the front (just spilling out all over), but have gaps on the sides by my armpits..? I even contacted the company for help with the fit but they just suggested adjusting the band and/or straps (both of which I did, but it didn't solve my problem).  The support is just not there either - my breasts are just spread out across my chest, giving me a uni-boob appearance under clothing.  Absolutely no shape whatsoever.  It has since been returned.  SUPER disappointed..."
2.0,Lenses are scratched.
2.0,"The length was great, but the fabric is costume-cloth thin, and not comfortable. The sleeves were a good four inches too short, and very snug."
2.0,Cheap quality for the price. Runs very small. Bad purchase.
2.0,Item was way bigger in size than expected
2.0,The tops were so tight I couldn’t get them on.
2.0,Earrings are far less bright yellow and much darker than they appear in the pictures.
2.0,"I'm usually a size 6, some of these rings were way too big. The metal is also scratchy and bumpy."
2.0,"I found this bathing suit to fit my daughter true to size, my daughter liked the cut and colors, and the material felt like it was good enough quality. However, she wore it for the first time yesterday, and there are several pills and pulls in the rear end of the suit, again, after only one wear. We live near the beach & my kids are on swim teams- we live in our bathing suits- and I have never had this experience before with other brands after the first wear. Very disappointed; I would not recommend this bathing suit."
2.0,I really like them but the buttons was to far back and the headband was to big for my head
2.0,it's barely green. mostly black. I thought I ordered the wrong one and send it back but the second one looked the same so yeah this ain't it fam.
2.0,"Didn’t really like them, cheap quality and not a good fit, lens are too close together, good for a child"
2.0,"This bra was not comfortable, I was extremely bummed."
2.0,"Really disappointed. The first time I put on a pair, they ripped a hole near the top. When I pulled them on, I could hear seams popping. And I'm sure I ordered the correct size. They just don't seem to be very well made."
2.0,"Too big and sloppy looking, had to return"
2.0,Product looks to fake to wear and is to big.
2.0,too hard fit
2.0,"as I suspected from the pic, the sleeves are so tight the criss-cross won't lay right,  even tho the body of the dress fits comfortably.  the red is a bright orange-red, not dark/wine red as pictured.  the fabric is thin, noticably low-quality and sticks to itself.  expected better for the price."
2.0,"Now, for context, I have a pretty average sized nose, but it is rounded more so at the end than pointy, and I think that’s where this product failed for me. Whenever I try to wear it, it slips further and further back into my nose trying to connect together, and it it almost got stuck at one point. Please please just proceed with caution if you have what is considered a button nose."
2.0,"Pretty, but way too small. Did not feel comfortable wearing at a shirt."
2.0,"Nice size but not even close to the color blue that is advertised.  Very disappointed because the picture for this item was true GSW colors.  When received, it was completely different.  My son will use it for school still but don't waste your money."
2.0,"Worked great the first 2 times of putting it on. When I took it off the second time, just sliding it off my wrist, the band came unglued from the attachment point. It’s very comfortable and you can achieve a perfect fit but the quality seems a little subpar."
2.0,HEADS UP! Ordered 2 sets of 3 pair. Did not receive one pair as pictured. All are very plain. Was looking for the the cute prints pictured! Seams came apart very easily.
2.0,"It's very pretty, and my daughter loved it, but it broke after about 2 hours."
2.0,Returned do to stiches coming undone after 4 days of normal wear. Good looking wish they were better quality.
2.0,Run small...looks more like a sweater than a sweater dress. I wear a medium ordered a large still was too small. But its cute...only if if it fitted..i would have kept iy.
2.0,I wanted to love it!  But I don't like the mustard and it is way too big for me.  The sleeves are way too big too.  I am so disappointed.  Runs big.  I bought 3x large and I think I should have gone with what I normally wear which is an large to x-large.  And even with my regular size I think it would be too big still
2.0,These Yellow Box flip flops were a HUGE disappointment.  They were made out of stiff plastic (as opposed to cloth) and were every uncomfortable to wear.  I will have to be careful next time and make sure the tops are not plastic.
2.0,I like the pattern & moisture wicking idea of this but it doesn't stay on in my helmet. I'm having to adjust it once my helmet is on & it always comes off when I take my helmet off. Not what I was hoping for with this.
2.0,"The necklaces were cute, but it only came with 2 shell necklaces and not 3. They were packaged so small that we didn't realize it was missing a necklace until we opened it to wrap for my daughter Christmas Eve. We didn't have time to return it so the two will have to do. At least my daughter loved them."
2.0,"You can see through this dress. Not great for my age, gave it to my 20 something daughter, and she loves."
2.0,Was really heavy and pulled on my skin. It's super cute but takes up my entire belly button. Not something I'd wear everyday.
2.0,"Press the &#34;Light&#34; button--what lights up is  . . . well, basically nothing. Deceptive to even have a &#34;Light&#34; button.  VERY disappointed.  Don't buy unless you carry a flashlight along with you everywhere."
2.0,Gems fall off
2.0,"The only thing I did not like about it was that it was too short in the front. It came to above the navel and due to that, nothing looked good with it. Disappointing."
2.0,Shoes look amazing and fit great.  After 2 wears they started falling apart.  I like them and wished they lasted longer. They are now being used as play shoes.
2.0,The entire outfit was to large
2.0,More of a salmon color than a tru orange
2.0,The fit of this dress was surpringly accurate.  with amazon I never know if I am going to get something so tight I can’t squeeze into it or if it will be a giant garbage bag.  I wear a size 8 and the medium fit well.  The length is nice - I am 5’3” and it hit me at the knee so it is not too short.  The fabric is polyester and feels like it but it isn’t too thin - the blue dress is not see through.  The only I’m not a fan of is the print.  The roses are confusing - I can’t tell if the fabric was cut upside down or if the flowers are supposed to face down?<br /><br />Wish it came in other patterns.  Thinking about buying the white.<br /><br />Updated:  Bought the white in the same size (medium).  It fit more like a small.  Had to return.  Also the white is too sheer.  Would need a slip.
2.0,cheap looking material
2.0,Turns to rust in 8 seconds.
2.0,"Nice and comfortable! However, the material isn’t the best it started breaking off in the first wash"
2.0,The pants run small and the material is see thin.
2.0,I wore it like twice and it already has a slit in the armpit. Hmmm not real high quality material there.  I ordered the same shirt in a smaller size over a year ago (I have gained weight) and the other shirt... which I am sure was from the same company... seemed better quality material.  Whomever makes this needs to get some consistency going. I won't buy it again.
2.0,Not good to large busy. Slips out. Not happy.
2.0,"I have an older version of these socks, and I ordered a new pair in the same size because I was happy with the first pair. These arrived, and the opening of the sock where you put your foot in was so tight, I could hardly get my foot through the opening. There was no stretch at all. Once I got them on, they foot portion fit fine. However, the top part around my ankle fit pretty tight (again, there is no stretch). I have slender ankles, so I can't imagine how tightly these would fit on a person with more average or large ankles. I am not sure if this problem is just a one-off issue or not."
2.0,I wore this top 3 times and was literally obsessed with it and then it all fell apart and one of the strings came off and I had to throw it away
2.0,"They work well, but are on the heavier side and seem to have random specks of gold paint on the arms in some spots. most is covered by hair when I wear it, but you can tell they're on the cheaper design side."
2.0,"This is a very small XL.<br />More like a Medium.<br />I gave it to my son.<br />He loves it.<br />So, I won’t order an outdoor vest online again."
2.0,"SUPER COMFY. Not flattering. Not at all like the model picture. The red color seems accurate like the picture. The neck is very wide. I dont get it. I cant wear a t-shirt under it because it looks dumb when the collar and most of the shoulders of my shirt show. The collar is so wide across the shoulders. The arm/shoulder seams land half way down my upper arm. I included a picture of it. I was going to buy it in the green color but im just going to use it as a staying home sweatshirt. I will not wear this in public. It looks like i measured and sewed it myself and thats not saying much. Also, i ordered a large. Im 5ft 3inches and 145lbs. I wear a size 8 to 10 in womens and about a 9 to 11 in juniors. Not super thin but not overweight. I am glad i ordered a large though because pulling this thing down over my not huge hips was a mildly difficult and if i had ordered smaller, it probably wouldnt have fit over my hips. This thing makes me look like a damn whale. SO unflattering and just crashed my confidence looking at myself wearing this. Also, the hem isnt as loose as the model picture. Its smaller than the width of the sweatshirt which is why it was a bit tricky getting it down over the hip area.  The hem touches my outer thighs and under my butt. The hem is not loose but the body is."
2.0,"I ordered a size 12 since the product was supposed to run small and they suggested ordering a size or two up.  Instead, I received a size 3X that looks like a circus tent on me (around size 8 US). When I contacted the seller, I was offered 15% off. Now, what use is 15% off going to do me when I am stuck with a circus tent. I would seriously consider ordering from this seller.  Sorry, I really like this too except for the pom-poms  with which I could decorate my windshield."
2.0,"These were my ""go to"" earrings but I am sad to report they have both broken.  The clasp has now fallen of both loops."
2.0,"My 7 year old is obsessed with baseball and was so excited to get these socks. The socks look nice, unfortunately they did not last long. Within a couple months all 3 pair of socks had holes in the toes and the heel worn through. My son is not hard on socks, some socks he has had for 2 years with no holes, so I was very disappointed to see these wear out so quickly."
2.0,"The glasses are good, but unlike the non-polarized Navigators pairs that we have purchased previously, the arms are pretty loose and the glasses don't fit as tightly on our daughters face. The loose arms also make it difficult for her to put them back on if/when they fall off.<br />We returned the first pair that we bought, thinking it was a one-off issue, but the second pair had the same problem. I'd stick with the cheaper Navigators."
2.0,Not crazy about this. It was much shorter than this in the waist than it looks in the picture and the quality seems really cheap.
2.0,"It was not as sturdy as I expected. It does not hold up around my waist, and definitely does not products, as soon without slipping off.!!!"
2.0,It's super flimsy . The rubber around it comes out after fairly easily. Wouldn't last long due to cheap material used. The carbon fiber is very thin. The rubber will most likely become loose after a while and cards will fall out.
2.0,Size was not accurate
2.0,The tie is really nice but the color is definitely brown instead of black.
2.0,Sloppy construction.
2.0,"I would love this bra except that the pads are just loosely floating and sliding around in the cups. This is just lazy, there's no reason that they couldn't sew them in. So then every time you wear them and/or wash them the pads will get folded up and crumpled and slide around and you have to fix them every time you go to wear them. Due to this I'll be returning it. Also if you do endeavor to buy this bra anyway, note that they do run a tad small so order a size up."
2.0,I tried two xl long and they were too large and now two lg long and they are some what small
2.0,"Returned immediately, frames were bent and didn’t fit.  Not sure if manufacturers issue or delivery issue but beware."
2.0,"Nice material, but fit was way too small."
2.0,It's so comfy i can't deny that but after the first wash you will feel that the dander between thighs on pants and under arms in shirt
2.0,Too small ordered usual size.
2.0,This was way too small. I had to return.
2.0,They look great but the fits not right And they roll down your arm !
2.0,Not soft and comfy
2.0,Pretty but very dull with no shine
2.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; and these come up TO my knees. I'm also a size 4, so weight really isn't the issue. These are cute, but NOT over the knee unless you're about 5'2&#34;."
2.0,"For me (5' 7""), the item is way too long.  The bottoms come down to my mid-calf.  Not a good look."
2.0,Definitely not nickel free as described. Worn less than 1 full day and got a rash from it. Decent quality if you’re not allergic to nickel. Nice weight to it.
2.0,ADORABLE EXCEPT FOR MISSING HEADBAND
2.0,I wanted to give this as a gift to someone but it's so cheap and poorly made that I couldn't bring myself to give it
2.0,Picture speaks a thousand words. Plastic looking headpiece is pictured and this soft cloth got delivered. Will definitely return.
2.0,It was too large in the chest area and I have mega large breast so for that not to fit was strange and the bottom was too small or not long enough. Could be my body type? The color is beautiful though and the fabric was nice.
2.0,Someone wrote that it was one size off...even that was not correct.  I ended up giving these to my sister.
2.0,"They're fine looks-wise and they're pretty comfortable, but they do not breathe at all. If you sweat even the smallest amount, it's staying in there. Which, as we all know, doesn't exactly make for a pleasant experience smell-wise. If you've ever had issues with breathability, steer clear of these, least your basement be flooded with stink."
2.0,Pendant way too small.
2.0,The books were pretty and fit well. But they only lasted a week! Very disappointed in how the sole just fell apart.
2.0,"The pattern is lovely, but the mask just does not fit. It comes up so high it is poking me in the eye. The gap at the top makes the mask ineffective. The wire nose bit is so short and does not come close to touching my face. Also, the fabric is a little scratchy. I'm really disappointed because I loved the pattern."
2.0,"I expected the entire insides to move, and on only one of them did the back move. The other one did nothing. I bought them with the intention of giving them to my husband for Christmas cause he loves the skeleton watches and I thought it would be cool to have them as a cufflink for him. I instead have returned them and found my issue to be an issue with everyone else. So I will not be repurchasing them. They were still very nicely made, just not what I thought they would be."
2.0,won't hold 17&#34; computer
2.0,This fit fine. However there's this weird silky material on the inside that shows because the collar folds over. It makes the vest look cheap and poorly made. I returned this product.
2.0,"The pants are inexpensive so they are as expected very thin material, but the sizing is off. The ones I got are way too big to be reasonable on a body my size. I'm 5'7"" 135 lbs, I got the size M and they are way too big. And the waist closure is drawstring, I would have prefered elastic."
2.0,While I liked these earrings to begin with I was only able to wear them 2 times before they broke beyond repair. It's fairly obvious why they are this inexpensive. Very disappointing since they were incredibly comfortable and cute. Will not be buying a new pair.
2.0,Shirt has elasticity<br />which adjusts to my size and body shape<br />I just wish there was a larger size available for those who with bigger bodies<br />(Gift for a friend)
2.0,"Too small, ordered an 8, sent back and received an 8.5, still too small but wearable. Very stiff material, not very comfortable. Would never buy again"
2.0,Too big. And very see through. Paper thin. But very cute.
2.0,there was not snake on the chain and it is huge! I'm not even really sure how it is supposed to sit because it doesn't sit anything like the photograph. I set it aside to reuse the chain for something else.
2.0,I did not care for it.  Wasn't what I thought.
2.0,"I purchased the size my grandson normally wears. I didn't realize these would stretch all out of proportion. They flop off his feet , now."
2.0,Nice case with cloth cleaner but the rubber ends of frame that goes around the ear kept falling off and I ended up losing them.
2.0,I didn’t like the way it felt on.
2.0,I’m 6’0” and it fit me like a babydoll dress!  If you are shorter with a small busy it would work for you but not for me.  Returning ASAP.
2.0,"While I was putting on the suit, I could hear the stitching ripping. Was shocked because the bathing suit bottoms are big on me."
2.0,It’s comfortable to wear for the value of the money but it’s not real it’s turning my finger colors it’s not a 925 silver because the ring itself is turning colors
2.0,The material is just an ok quality. We’re in a rush or I’d return and find something else. Will have to reattach the buttons for this event.
2.0,Fits fine but the fabric is so see through!
2.0,"It's cute, but it runs SO small. I normally would order a large in dresses because I have larger hips, but I sized up to an XL because of a previous review. IT WAS SOOOO SMALL. It wouldn't button in my chest area, which is large, but not huge (34D). Around my waist and hips it was skin tight. I would have to probably get a XXXL for it to fit."
2.0,Very warm on my cold feet. But do not wash them. Not very good
2.0,"I normally wear a 34DDD from Victoria's secret but was starting to spill out of them with early pregnancy. I didn't want to pay too much for a larger bra not knowing what my size requirements might be in the near future. I purchased a 36E. It fits like a 36D, with spillage out the sides and tops. It is way too small. It is also pretty flimsy and does little to protect from the cold. The third knock against it is that I have small shoulders and the shoulder adjustments are only partially adjustable. So the bra straps are way too big on me. This is not a bra I can wear in public. but it might work as a &#34;I'm doing housework and laundry today&#34; kind of bra."
2.0,Adorable & well constructed hat.  The fit is WAY too small and I don't have a large head.  Bummed it didn't work out. I will be returning it.
2.0,loved floral pattern and fabric but totally mis-sized compared to sizing on label
2.0,These look great but only for the right shape of face. For people with big domes like me these do not stretch well and are tight between the temples. I wear a 7 5/8 hat and these fit really tight. I left my pair in the car in the heat and when I put them on they cracked in half and a lens fell out. For the money i guess i cant really expect too much.  But if you have a smaller head and were really delicate with these i guess they would be a better deal.
2.0,"I have this dress in another color and love it so I expected this one to fit perfectly, but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. It was a bit loose which caused some bunching in unfortunate places, but the bigger issue was the color. While the dress was loose in the midsection it was tight in the bust, causing the black fabric to turn white. The last thing I need is a spotlight where my clothing is tight, so I had to return it."
2.0,"I ordered the Dark Green thinking it would be more of a dark emerald green but the scarf I received is more of a dark Olive green. However, it is a very good quality."
2.0,These were a little disappointing. I have a hard time getting them on because they won't clasp correctly.
2.0,Its beautiful but very uncomfortable and tight..i was expecting it to be adjustble according to waist..but it just elastic whcih is not adjustible like other belts.. so dnt buy
2.0,Cute.....but popped after 2 wears
2.0,The dress came below the knee (I’m 5’7”) and the material is poor in quality. I am returning this dress.
2.0,"Didnt get the socks that were pictured, and they are kind of crap. If you get sent the actual socks I'm sure they're good; luck of the draw I guess."
2.0,Tight on the bust. The sleeves were not as presented the images. The material was cheaper than expected. Not worth 30 dollars
2.0,"They look good and comes with interesting styling (ear buds attached) but they fail the main purpose; that is keeping water out. I have tried every technique but somehow water always managed to slip in. The fog up easy and just forget about diving with them on, they  never stay on no matter how tight you tie them."
2.0,They are great if your connector is the same as what gets delivered. These did not work for me but I held on to them anyway.
2.0,It was beautiful but the color has tarnished and it hasn’t even been in water more of dull silver color now.
2.0,"Hello,<br /><br />I have worn this hoodie a few times a week for about 3 weeks now and the amount of pilling especially on the wrist areas has gotten to the point where it is uncomfortable to wear. The fabric feels relatively heavy but the quality of the hood and the sleeves is very noticeably poor and pills a lot."
2.0,"They didn't fit.  I am 34 in belts. Usually thy might be a little tight, but these ones didn't make it around my waist. I don't know if it is a product defficiency or they are actually smaller than regular."
2.0,Did NOT fit well
2.0,"At first I thought this was going to be a great watch band.  Unfortunately, I've only had it 3-4 months and it's already starting to fail.  The coloring of the band is wearing off, the magnets(which are very strong) keep coming off, and the metal weave is fraying on the edges.  The fraying may be the biggest issue as the little metal piece start snagging on my clothes and are very poky.  Overall, I can only give this 2 stars as it has not held up like I was hoping."
2.0,This item was entirely too thin
2.0,Too slippery fabric....doesn’t stay on my head.
2.0,I bought this for my mother who weighs 100 lb in a size small as well as two other dresses but this one she could not even get over her head and arms as it does not stretch it
2.0,We can’t text while wearing.
2.0,"I like the color and feel, but I haven't been about to wear it because it sheds SO bad. Like you touch it and it snows fuzzies. And it's hand wash only so I'm scared to try running it through the wash to try to fix the shedding."
2.0,I let the return time expire because we went on spring break. The color was washed out not the vibrant color in the picture.
2.0,was way too small
2.0,"Ugh. I’m 5’6, 28 waist, 34 hips and 36C. I ordered my usual size small. I can get it on, but it’s way too snug in my arms and is too short. It fits in every other way though, in the bust, waist and hips. So either the size chart is way off, it’s poorly made and not proportional/designed well, or perhaps both. What a bummer. This style would have looked so cute on me if it wasn’t for the weirdly very tight arms and super shortness. I’ll give it to my short petite 5’3 friend who might be able to make it work. If you’re interested in purchasing I highly suggest ordering a size up, but it may end up being big every where but the arms :/"
2.0,"the material was too thin, the color was supposed to have been red and it looks orange. It fits okay but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I feel I just wasted my money"
2.0,I wear a small everywhere else but not with this dress. I had at least 2 inches between myself and the dress. This dress is not for petite women or the tag was stitched with the wrong size.
2.0,My pack was missing the Saturday pair :/
2.0,The product is made cheap. The seams don't look like they will hold up long. And had holes. They fit great when I got them though a little tight around the thighs. DO NOT WASH they will shrink alot
2.0,Fabric looks to cheap and sheer.
2.0,"I'm having a horrible time trying to fit these in without damaging my ears.  The flares are very bulky and very firm, which might not be bad once they're in, but makes it difficult to do so.  I saw someone else recommend stretching the lobe some with a taper, but I'd rather not go that route myself so you may want to try a size down to see how that works.  I'm also about as paper white as it gets, and these don't match my skin very well.  As others have said there's more of a yellow tint to them than what I'd call flesh"
2.0,"The product did NOT link removal tool. Please send me the link removal tool, the band is too big for my wrist."
2.0,These slippers have absolutely no support. It's like walking on cardboard even with the memory foam. They do keep feet warm as expected.
2.0,"I've seen some reviews mentioning that the key ring is made of titanium and therefore feels cheap, well I think they weren't quite that honest. It feels like plastic and bends a bit too easily for my taste. If your keys have a small key carrier hole, don't buy this. It won't sit right, as per my attached pictures. Kinda disappointing and not worth the money. :/ I'll give it two stars overall because if you have no other alternatives it gets the job done."
2.0,Nice enough shirt. But I ordered an extra large and it is even tight on my 100 pound tail thin daughter who usually wears an XS or even XXS.
2.0,The stone does not reign the ring frame
2.0,"It is very close fitting. If you think u would wear a s/m u might want to get a large instead. Especially if u you have a thick cafe or tibia area. Not alot of stretch , firm and sturdy material.  I believe if u get your right size then it would be perfect"
2.0,Will work for 1 hour
2.0,I've only used these three times and they already have a hole in the bottom. For the price point I hoped they would have lasted quite bit longer. Other than that they have just the right amount of grip and work well.
2.0,"Came very quickly, but we're VERY tiny!!"
2.0,Just right for the price but you also pay for what you get you’re gonna need some glue by three and glue all of them for that price
2.0,"Strap broke after less than a month, and the underside began to rust."
2.0,The gold necklace was fine but the pearl necklace was so short it was more of a choker but uncomfortable. I gave it to my three year old daughter who it fit as a shorter necklace.
2.0,"In general the boots look pretty good. However, they did not explain how to properly determine the height of the boot. I was concerned about making it too tall in the back to be able to sit in, but did not know that there would be a split inside the back to allow extra room. Otherwise, I would have asked to have them made taller so that the front would extend over the knee. They only asked for the desired boot height, but they needed to specify the height of the rear split so that we are able to properly determine how tall we can make it.<br /><br />Most of the boot was actually way to wide because they make sure it can fit the widest part of your calves. It did fit, but looks baggy, so it should be better streamlined by taking more than one calf measurement. You also need to get an insole insert so that you don't have to walk on hard wood all day.<br /><br />If you don't know what &#34;PU leather&#34; is, you will find out that it is Poly (synthetic) leather. While I didn't expect real leather, I also didn't expect the horrible and strong smell of the synthetic material. I had to stick these in the garage for weeks until the smell started to dissipate or it would have stunk up the entire house. Who knows what chemicals are being emitted from these boots?<br /><br />Had I known about these problems, I probably would have spent more for a real leather set of boots."
2.0,"Unfortunately, I thought this dress was very cheap looking. I had to send it back."
2.0,I expected this to smoothen me out and have a little control fit. It fit like a Cami top. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless you're looking for a basic slip for under your dress.
2.0,This Blazer looked different from the photo.  I didn't realize how lightweight the fabric was. For a Blazer I would like a more structured fit this is almost like a cardigan. I had to return.
2.0,"The dress is cute. It comes HUGE though so I will be returning it. Got a small and it fits on me like an extra large would. 5'4&#34; 115 lbs, petite girls do not buy this dress the sizes are off"
2.0,Lightweight and small.
2.0,some of the bands do not attach properly.  pin does not securely connect on some of the bands.  Face falls off.
2.0,for a child's wrist
2.0,Fabric tore after wearing it once. Super cute design but bummed about quality
2.0,"I am a 42DDD and while the suit fit fine in the waist and I loved the skirt, the boobage area was too small. Even if it had fit reasonably well, the pads inside the cup stood out in a very noticeably and unflattering way. Sadly I had to return it. This is not the suit for large chested women."
2.0,The second time I wore it the front closure separated from the fabric on one side while I was out at an event.
2.0,"Disliked the material. Very cheap, thin. And uncomfortable. Not true to size"
2.0,Cute water shoes. Go on and off with ease. Have only been worn 3-4 times and they are wearing thin around the toes.
2.0,"Stones are falling out after a couple of months. I know this was a cheap ring,  but I had my last one a few years before that happened."
2.0,"Bought 2-3T for my 28 month old (2 yrs n 4 months) petite daughter but the dress is too short and loose for her and the cloth used is too thin (though it’s alright, given the high temperatures lately)."
2.0,You have to pull it apart in the seam.  When you pull out the key ring the siren goes off.
2.0,Not at all the fit or quality I expected. Skirt is made of very shiny material. Skirt is also very short in length making it impossible to bend over in this skirt. The shirt also did not flare out like the skirt pictured on model. Still made it work but was not impressed by this skirt.
2.0,This is basically a sack. Doesn't matter the size. It is extremely unflattering. And I don't like wearing a sack for how much I paid. Returned promptly. Don't buy this one. It's a big miss.
2.0,Nice warm shirts.  I was afraid they would be too big because I odered a size up.  They are TOO small.  I gave them to my daughter who wears a size 14 girls.  These shirt are womens 8-10 and fit her perfectly.
2.0,Had to return; very thin material and they run too small.
2.0,"The belt looked nice but runs small.  I ordered the 90cm, for a 26 in waist, and had to return ."
2.0,"These earrings were super fun to feel glam. However, halfway through the night the back clasp broke and an earring fell off.<br /><br />Moral of the story: Fun for a few hours."
2.0,You pay what you get.
2.0,"HUGE parks and rec fan here, unfortunately super disappointed in this shirt :(<br />it feels good and seems to be good quality but the image is TOTALLY slanted! It’s off center and looks terrible! Was supposed to be a gift for my parks and rec fan husband. So sad"
2.0,"The whole reason I bought this was to use it as a gift for my best friend. When it came in, the card that says “You’re my person” had spelling errors on it. Why would I give a gift that has words misspelled on it?! The necklace is also a lot smaller than it appeared online and seems like it will break easily. Definitely not worth the money!"
2.0,They are short and the heel slips. Other than those things they are cute.
2.0,I did give this a 5 star but then the badge clip broke today! I haven't even had this a month! I love the design so I fixed the clip myself but it's just annoying! Get stronger clips!
2.0,These were way too small for me. I'm a size 10 narrow and they scrunched my toes and was painful. They should come in sizes.
2.0,This product runs super small!! Pretty thin material too.
2.0,I figure the case is what cost $7. i just got my glasses about 3 minutes ago . I put them on to see how they looked when taking them off and closing the earpieces the right broke off. I gave a 2 star bc I like the case they came with.
2.0,The glasses are good quality but they are too small for anyone but a child.
2.0,"Prompt delivery, however, most of the backs of the earrings had become unattached from the display card and therefore the earrings themselves were lying loose in the bottom of the bag. Also, as a result, a few of the posts were slightly bent; I assume from the mailing process. The color was pretty. Would definitely not order again."
2.0,These were made from the stretchy material. Didn’t fit well at all.
2.0,Horrible quality!!! The shirt is a shiny material....not soft plaid!!! Another cheap made in China sweat shop shirt....i highly advise not to order!!!
2.0,It's a beautiful coat. The problem is that it runs super small. I usually wear a 10 -12 jacket and that's what I bought but can't close it....I  would say it's 2 sizes off
2.0,"Beautiful ring, but where it circles around and joins is a very sharp edge"
2.0,"This dress could've been everything if it weren't too big!  I'm a small and the small fit like a Medium.  This is supposed to be a skin tight fit and it was lose on me.  I wish they had size XS, I would've totally ordered it. I'm 5.1 and 130lbs and the Small was definitely too big, but if you're a Medium, a small will fit."
2.0,"Very cheaply made ,there is a shadow on this dress. Like it was under something that made an impression on it. Now I know why it was so cheap! There are 2 pockets. But, not happy with this purchase!"
2.0,"I typically wear a 7/8 shoe size. Ordered a 8 but is definitely too big, fits like a 9. I will be exchanging them because I still think they are cute."
2.0,"I Loved the style and color of these boots!!! They even fit, which is not an easy feat for me. They were such a good price for the style, too. When I realized that the awful rubber smell that was permeating my room, was coming from the soles of my adorable boots, I about flipped. I'm allergic to the toxic ingredients in that cheap rubber. A week outside didn't ""air"" them out a bit. Back they went. I would've paid more to have those cute boots made with a higher quality sole! Disappointed."
2.0,These say Erik instead of woody. I needed to look closer. My fault.<br />However I ordered a 4T these run super small and are more like a 2T. If wash must hang dry.
2.0,"I enjoy the way this looks and it was easy to install. My only issue was that because I am active during work I would constantly knock my wrist and the latch would come undone and my watch would fall onto the concrete floor causing damage. In a more casual environment, or if you are not wearing this during activity it is fine, but be aware that it will easily come off."
2.0,To big for my ears
2.0,"The “fabric” is very thin. Felt like I was wearing a tent or a kite. For the value, the price should have been much cheaper. But the “undies” on the inside was fine to me."
2.0,"The suit runs small. I double checked the measurements (and my own) and found that while I can wear it, it is really small."
2.0,"more rectangle than square, kinda bummed, looked square in pic."
2.0,shorter than most lanyards and the breakaway clasp at the top of the neck is very itchy.
2.0,"Only had for a month or so, but love it so far.  Looks great!<br /><br />Now I’ve had this for about 6 months and it has a rip in it already.  Not happy at all, not worth the money......."
2.0,I bought a navy blue top and it was so comfortable I decided to get another in a different color. What a difference! The 2nd top in rust/brown was so much smaller (I bought both in a Large) and uncomfortable. I had also bought matching pants and the same issue. The navy blue ones are fantastic the other pair is just miserable. I sent an email to the company but no reply. Very disappointing
2.0,Terrible quality. Fell apart after first use. Straps are much flimsier than in the picture. Would recommend buying something a little more expensive and sturdy.
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter. The dress fit well in the waist, but the bust was way too tight. The only way should wear it was by leaving the top unbuttoned which was way too inappropriate.  If you are larger than a &#34;B&#34; cup don't expect this to fit.  I would have returned this, but after having the shipping deducted it really would not have been worth my efforts.  So I opted to give it to someone who was less endowed. It was really a cute dress. Too bad it did not fit."
2.0,This is way too heavy for daily use. It is loud and &#34;clanky&#34;. I refuse to wear it at work as it's distracting to my patients... It sits in the bottom of my work bag. It's too bad I didn't return it on time.
2.0,"The minute I put them on, one of the clips broke. It's very loosely attached with weak solding work. The beads and artwork are pretty, they are very large - three inches top to bottom. It's a hassle to return, so I'll probably try to wear one with out the clasp. Not good."
2.0,fell apart second wear
2.0,"The color and pattern are nice. The waist fit is not very nice, and the belt is too thin to look nice if tied at the proper waist length. Don't buy if you're busty because it will look a little frumpy"
2.0,"First off, just got the gloves, so I don't know anything about how long they'll last.<br /><br />HOWEVER: These gloves are NOT the gloves in the picture.  These are snapped parade gloves, not the fitted gloves that are shown in the picture.  VERY unhappy about this, as I ordered them specifically so they would not have snaps, as my application doesn't allow for them.<br /><br />To the seller: Update your pictures."
2.0,"Fyi, this dress runs very small. I ordered a 2X, and it fits like an XL. The material feels like polyester. It's not flowy, like it appears in the photos. It's an ok dress, for the price. But make sure you size up, and that you can handle polyester material in the summer!"
2.0,The product itself seems really sturdy and is very cute.  But the color was a little off from what the picture showed...not by much but it wasn't as bright as in the picture.  Also I have only had this product for a couple of days and on the very first day I wore it to work the strap broke out of no where!  It is a very cheap gold metal button that holds the leather loop together around the gold clasp that broke off.  I hate having to deal with returning things so I just grabbed my super glue and super glued it back together.....such a pain though and very disappointing.
2.0,"Watch broke after a month of normal usage!! The wristband just snapped off today... A shame too, because this was my favorite watch.  I loved it, and recommended the brand to people.  Definitely a disappointment!"
2.0,UGH!  My Skyrim fan loved the pendant - but the chain didn't last 1/2 hour before breaking.  So plan on a replacement chain.
2.0,Stems were weak and are about to break.
2.0,"Not totally rimless, not when there is a metal piece going over the top of the lens. When it says rimless make sure there isn't a piece of metal that the lens is screwed to. I honestly couldn't give more than 2 stars."
2.0,It looked better in picture and the sleeves are way to big as they did not stay put
2.0,Should of expected lightweight .improper size(small) wristband..clasp that does not connect
2.0,"I was really excited for these shorts but they really are all wrong. First off the material is thin so they ride up and they are too loose so you get this weird airy space in the crotch area. The scrunch in the back is overly aggressive and doesn’t flatter my butt because the shorts are so loose. And last thing, the seam in the front is very strong and goes straight up and makes for an unsightly appearance if you will. So with all that being said, they are soft but I will not be keeping them."
2.0,Didn't fit tight at all if u like or are going for that look this isn't for u
2.0,I love this necklace so much and am so disappointed it tarnished after only 3 months.
2.0,Not comfortable<br />Tight snd and
2.0,The silver cracked almost instantly.
2.0,"Cute, ran a little small."
2.0,"Does not Look as pictured: not the quality pictured. Lighter weight than expected and runs Very small. I am 5' 4"" waist is high and not at natural waist. Photo shows a natural waist or a drop waist, on me the waist is just under my bust, about 6-8"" from where it should be. Also, length is shorter than pictured. Length is above my knee, rather than below my knee. Chest square does not cover full chest area; about 10"" wide in chest square; 14"" would provide better torso protection and show as pictured. I am a size misses 10. This apron would fit a child as pictured or a very short size 4."
2.0,The shoe horn broke at the base on the 4th day. The plastic was flexible but too soft.
2.0,"It's a beautiful purse, but I'm REALLY upset that, even though the photos of the purse have pockets on the inside, there are none other than the zippered one. I was already apprehensive about getting the purse because of the lack of pockets, but I figured I'd take a chance with it because I thought the purse was so lovely. Quite a bit disappointed. Definitely a beautiful purse, though."
2.0,Words were not correct. It said 1/2 Cold Warm. It did not say 1/2 Cold 1/2 Warm so I’m not happy at all. It runs very small. A girl who wears XS usually would need a medium.<br /><br />Update: the company was very prompt in their refund which is nice.
2.0,"The shorts are small for their sizing - my son wears a boys 6, and he has some room in them, and these were tight all around the bum and legs. I ordered the beige and they are very see-through as well."
2.0,"Very cute, but also very fragile to wear."
2.0,body part fit tight and the length of the sleeves are to my hands...
2.0,Very difficult to removed band-seems to get caught frequently
2.0,"I bought the large and small suitcase a while ago because I travel for my job constantly. It was an amazing set of luggage until the wheel crushed into the body. And I would love to see about the warranty but cannot find any way to get ahold of the company. A few more things I did not like is that the luggage came with a plastic film over it that started peeling away after the first time to the airport conveyor belts and made it look like trash, also the outside ABS plastic scratch is so deep and so easily it looks like I have taken a knife to mine."
2.0,Is not flattering at all... Makes you look frumpy- if you have an extra weight( a little pouch or muffin top) this will do nothing in the flattering department.
2.0,"Overall, I wasn't too pleased. I think I'm too short so it looked weird. For reference I'm 5' 1"", 115 pounds. I also didn't like that the white was see through. I did give it an extra star because the quality of the material is good!"
2.0,This is not a brand new watch and it runs not too smoothly after few months. Veronica of ChronoStore didn't reply me after I received the watch.
2.0,I sized up and this was still way to small. I ordered a large and I’m a D cup in the chest and a large bottoms always fit but my boobs were falling out of the top and the bottoms were way too cheeky.
2.0,"I would have kept them , if there were eyelets not ; quick-lace fittings at the top."
2.0,These are very pretty but one doesn't close properly. I had to fiddle around with it to get it to click closed. I expect a NEW item to NOT need repair before I can use it. Shame!
2.0,"Nice material, but way longer than expected. It almost went to my ankles and I’m 5’2”."
2.0,If you have a big head find something else
2.0,"It looks cheap, but hey it was only $4.05 so I guess I shouldn't expect any thing more!!!"
2.0,small but beautiful
2.0,"The dress is too short. The front of the dress was  sewn very high. I am 5""9 and the dress is probably more tailored for a shorter person. It did fit but the split was too high."
2.0,They are completely see through really cheap material for 16.00 can get two better pairs elsewhere I never write reviews but I felt I needed to as these enticed me and sure they are or will others as well  - not to mention the fabric came already pulling / tearing .
2.0,I really like the way this looks and its a good quality but too small.
2.0,"Tighter than expected, will not be buying again. Product is very soft and seem to be well made"
2.0,"I love how reflective the hat is, but it is itchy and the top came unstitched."
2.0,"Dress fits really weird.  It's got a tiny bit of stretch, but the collar is really weird.  You have to have extremely straight and proper posture or else the collar seems too far back and makes you look like you have no neck.  If you have a long neck and very very straight posture it wont be an issue.  I have arthrtitis in my back and neck and can't get quite upright enough so it made me look like I had no neck.  The back collar sticks up really high and covers most of your neck, and the front of the collar does not come out as far as it would on a normal shirt or dress.  Other than that one issue, it'd be a really cute dress.  I had to return this one sadly."
2.0,The large didn't fit as a large should.. But i love the deep pockets..
2.0,Small. Not as it seems in the pictures. Maybe for a child.
2.0,"Not quite as pretty as the picture, but somewhat cute. Very fragile.... They haven't broken yet, but they are very flimsy."
2.0,Just received them in the mail today the lenses are about half as thick as the originals and makes them bow outward which causes a little distortion in the lense. If they were the same thickness I would probably give them 5 stars. I've not had a chance to check the quality of the optics as it's dark out now. Lenses are horrible I've tried to wear the glasses but the lenses give me a headache. Several friends have also tried them on at my request and we all agree it's like wearing someone else's prescription lenses. I don't recommend buying these
2.0,"Its cute but every time I wash it it shrinks.  Also the weird extra material lining, like 2 inches over the chest is strange and looks frumpy. I don’t know what purpose it serves but it bunches up and can be seen over the material."
2.0,I wanted to like this and wear it proudly. Feels like a Kirpilani panty on my face.
2.0,I should have ordered a bigger size
2.0,"This dress is so sheer, you could see my pores through it. Also, whoever designed it has never seen a woman with actual, real, live breasts. I’m barely a c-cup, and my boobs were fighting to stay in the top, harder than amber heard in court. Returned."
2.0,"I ordered two. A blue & army green. Received two in army green in a small & medium size-both in different material. Also, the bottom of the leg part wasn’t as fired as the rest of the outfit. Disappointed!"
2.0,"They fit well, keep your feet warm and are pretty comfortable. However, just three months into owning them and both soles have holes on bottom and water now comes through."
2.0,Product was nice but it was too small.  Its Asian sized.  I suggest anyone to get at least 2 size bigger than what you wear.
2.0,"Product is ok, sadly it is very small, not meant for an adult male or female face."
2.0,This does not run true to size
2.0,"2-2.5 Stars- Selowin Women's Casual Button V Neck 2 Piece Sweatsuit Set Pullover Shorts Pajamas Outfits Black L<br /><br />You could possibly pull this off if you have the perfect body, face, and generally look flawless- but otherwise, it looks a bit bulky with an unflattering shape.<br /><br />It is decently comfortable overall, though the fabric isn't as soft as I would prefer for loungewear. It is decently stretchy, but the fabric is average.<br /><br />The shirt is my least favorite. I just can't style it in a way that looks nice on me- definitely not with sleeves down and still looks odd with sleeves pushed up. It comes off a bit cheap and just generally unflattering. I guess it kind of looks as advertised in the video, but I'm no model.<br /><br />The shorts aren't great either, but if I pull up them up and wear it high waisted, then it looks somewhat acceptable with a different shirt.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not really a fan. I could wear it around the house if no one were around, but otherwise, I just feel like I look strange. As for quality, the fabric seems to hold up decently and I didn't notice any huge issues with stitching.<br /><br />I wouldn't order again solely on style."
2.0,"I was surprised by the quality of the metal and the black color. It looks nice at first but after a couple days, rubbing the desk while typing on a keyboard or writing with a pen had already started rubbing off the black. This is a small mesh band which I like because it's metal in contact with the skin that keeps things cool and gives the watch a little movement on your arm (air).<br /><br />The tool is cheap but functional, certainly good enough to change one watch with. The underside of the attachment point for the watchband has nice grooves you can get into to release and tighten the spring pins (or whatever they're called).<br /><br />It is missing the secondary clasp that I'm used to on Skagen or similar bands of this type. Basically once it's on your watch and adjusted properly, it's a one-step snap release. There is no first releasing a larger clasp and then the main mechanism in two steps. This means the main mechanism is a bit tighter which seems nice. You will probably have to bend the metal ever so slightly to tighten or loosen this a bit as the watchband ages. That seems normal to me and I've had to do it for Skagens. Truth be told the extra secondary clasp seems unnecessary and it used to catch on shirts and other things and come off too easily. Maybe it's good that it's gone? If you look closely however you will find a hole on either side of the clasp exactly where that secondary bar would attach. I worry it's designed to have one and simply doesn't.<br /><br />If you are light with the touch and don't ever bump into the band it will look fine. I find the paint chipping off unacceptable and I returned it."
2.0,"When I heard about this bag I was so excited that I came straight to Amazon to buy one. It's my style. I love the look of the bag and not to mention not only am I buying a nice bag but also donating money for a worthy cause...to only find out the bag is $60 and only $20 goes to WFP. Not to mention that it's made in China. I'm so upset and disappointed in these people, I mean come on. That's sneaky, shame on you, tell the truth. They should have just said ""listen, if you buy this bag, $20 goes to the fund, we get $37 and the Chinese get $3 per bag."" Whose profiting here?"
2.0,"Really weirdly and unflatteringly cut, i have a small frame and ordered a small and it was very baggy in the waist and under the bust. Material is not too thin but has a strange texture. Theres stretch to the dress but like i said it was too large for it to be flattering"
2.0,"Braid is awesome, clasp is neat. Made it all of 2hrs before the cord just slipped out of the clasp though. Got it back in and had to use some pliers to crimp it onto the cord."
2.0,"The belt looks nice, however, no warning was given on the website that the product may expose the buyer to chemicals that can cause cancer.  That information is provided with the shipment, warning the buyer of the issue.  If you aren't concerned about that, go for it.  The belt will probably suit your needs.  However, one would think that a company selling a 'vegan' product would be more health conscious and at least warn the prospective buyer before they spend the money."
2.0,Bracelet beads way too oversized.  Very clunky.
2.0,"Very pretty design, but the gold color is so gaudy and looks a little too inexpensive."
2.0,Cheap material way to small ordered xl fit like large
2.0,It is very big or large but it keeps you very warm. I have work in ice coolers and I have to come in and out of them and it works fine for me.
2.0,"A little bigger than I thought, clingy and not half as cute as portrayed..I am done buying wrinkly clothes on here..<br />Was a gift though..overpriced for cheap crap"
2.0,"I typically wear a small in skirts, shorts, etc. I'm 5'4"" and 110#s. I decided to order a size up because these run small, and ordered a medium. It was very snug and uncomfortable around the waist. I had to return it. Otherwise, the skirt was very cute and the material was nice...there's just NO WAY I'm a large. That's insulting, ha."
2.0,Very scratchy and boxy. Runs large so not flattering.
2.0,"This wallet has slots for business cards that are too narrow for a standard-size (4&#34;x2&#34;) card.  You would need to cut off the side(s) of a card to fit it into the slots.  Why can't they make it just a little bit wider?  This is really thoughtless design.  It also lacks a place for a pen, which I really miss.  Although I like the color I got (military green), I am quite unhappy with the design of this wallet.  I liked my old one a lot better."
2.0,"Dress is more washed out than the picture shows and not the fabric I was expecting. I had previously ordered a different dress from the same brand and materials listed on the tag, (and I love that dress) but this dress is more cotton than polyester. Not sure if I will keep it or not."
2.0,"It waaaaas good.<br />The first time I wore this dress it was fantastic and super comfy. Then I washed it. The red seeped onto the white parts and stained them pink, so that's a bummer. It was nice while the colors didn't bleed."
2.0,dont fit for Asian，too too too large！
2.0,"This is a very nice set of earrings but the screw backs are no way the same as in the picture,  to me itis misleading. I will return them"
2.0,"Unfortunately, the mask received is nothing like the photoshopped mask pictured. I guess that should have been a sign. It is just a plain, solid mask. The seller has offered to refund."
2.0,These are not appropriate for outerwear. Definitely a house shoe or slipper and the Velcro is always coming undone. Would not purchase again.
2.0,This item did not fit my wrist well and it's not very durable. I was a bit disappointed.
2.0,I  ordered these watch bands because of the design. I got the color black with arrows and it looks good in my Gear S2. It doesn't look cheap but its not a stand out either. I think I still prefer a plain band after trying this one. I still can't say if the arrow design will hold up for a long time. One major concern I have about this band is that it's quite a job in connecting and disconnecting it in my watch. It's not easy to put and remove them. I received this as a complimentary product in exchange of my fair feedback in a form of a review.
2.0,I loved this bracelet before it broke and small pieces fell all over the floor. It was dainty and perfect for those with small wrists. I wish it could have lasted longer than six months.
2.0,Fits way too small. Size up. I had to send back
2.0,"Missing a zipper pull tab on one cube. On largest cube...only one zipper total. Two things wrong and not as product is described. Nice product, but quality control is nonexistent????"
2.0,Bad quality. Material is a bit too thick. Doesn't look flattering.
2.0,"Buy a size smaller than usual, very baggy"
2.0,The arms are short and the waistline is huge
2.0,nice coat too tight
2.0,"The 8-ball rack was bent on arrival so the the third ball down on the outside doesn’t stay tight, it rolls away from the other balls every time! Tried several times to get it to stay tight but not happening"
2.0,They're cheaply made. They feel like they'll snap anytime I close them. Thru did arrive fast though and do well blocking the sun.
2.0,Love this but it fell apart in the first week of use. So cute though
2.0,Does not fit on my ear. It falls off every time. I've tried adjusting it trying different techniques but no luck.
2.0,I ordered a 2x and it fit more like a US women's size 12.
2.0,I normally wear a medium very loosely.  This is Very tight on me.
2.0,The fit is very unflattering.
2.0,"These are a little bit on the tighter side if you have bigger thighs, and the elastic strap on the back rolls very easily, causing discomfort if you wear them for too long. They are very sturdy, however, and I'm glad I bought them!<br /><br />Edit: these have since broken multiple times in several different places regardless of how gentle I was with them. If you plan on wearing them every day, don't buy these!"
2.0,I’m so sad about this dress. I put it on to check size and it was perfect- PERFECT. Normally it’s hard finding dresses due to my height but this was the perfect dress. It was so cute and I planned to wear it for photos with my family the following day. I washed according to tag instructions and it shrunk SO much in length that now it’s the length of a shirt. I look like Winnie the Pooh.<br />I seriously feel disheartened by this.<br />Don’t be fooled. I doubt I can return now since I washed it. So I’m out the money and have a dress I can not wear.
2.0,"Just as pictured. Material is nice. It’s thick so probably better for spring, fall or winter but very pretty. However I’m mad because the shrinkage seems excessive (see picture and decide for yourself). New out of package it fit my kids perfectly but after one wash- no dryer - it doesn’t fit anymore. Took off 3 stars for the shrinking because now it feels like i paid for single use socks :( which is not a good value at all!! I still left 2 stars because they are pretty. Love the colors and material and knit pattern."
2.0,I ordered the white color and it was so see-through you could see my underwear even wearing skin tone color.  Have to return this one.  May try another color.  The fit was true to size; I’m a 28” waist and ordered the M.
2.0,I thought the padding was built in so would not have to fool with it all the time. Plus the covering started to peel away on the first washing.
2.0,It started getting holes very quickly. Very poor-quality material.
2.0,These are way to short for me. I'm 5'8 and they were inches off the floor.  Would probably work for much shorter girls
2.0,The elastic band around the waist does not seem to be stitched in place very well and has a tendency to roll and shift.<br />Seat padding is just okay certainly could be better positioned.
2.0,"This is NOT a shirt with sleeves. It is only a scarf. The body came up above my belly button, sleeves were long. But nothing like the picture"
2.0,"Fit as expected. Expected a sweatshirt, this is very lightweight, nylon type fabric."
2.0,"The description says its expandable but its not! Do not be fooled. I am not sure why none of the reviews mentioned this very important feature. Were all the good reviews from people given this product for free or given a discount? Also, it has a couple of dents on each side already! Very poor quality. Please save yourself some money and don't buy this brand. I bought two GoPlus carry on (wish I had seen it before this) and it looks a lot sturdier, not to mention it only cost $36.99."
2.0,Too large & didn't like the fit. Made me look much larger. Returned it for a refund.
2.0,They are just simple socks. If you have bigger thighs don’t buy. They will roll down.
2.0,"Surprisingly rough inside the toe compared to my other Darn Tough’s, with the exception of some Cool Max’s, and especially when compared to the Vermont Hunter.  I had to return these immediately after trying them on.  Ordered more of the Vermont Hunter, which was much softer inside and also somewhat ribbed around the arch.<br /><br />Very nice color though."
2.0,Three people in my house tried to use this.  None of us could get it to stay up over our nose.
2.0,I loved it because it was cute ! But it fits super super tight !
2.0,Very small weird material. Fits very snug to head if you have a lot of hair it wont fit.
2.0,It didn't do justice to my shape and the fabric looks cheap like a costume.
2.0,edges are visible i can't wear it.
2.0,Not as pictured. Not true to size at all. Looks like a little girl shirt.
2.0,This fit like capris on me. I'm 5&#34;9 152 slender athletic build
2.0,I used these for the back of the car - faded very quickly.  Maybe better for inside use only.
2.0,This is NOT a short sleeve shirt. It has capped sleeves with sleeves attached. It looks awkward.
2.0,Cheaply made. Falling apart in several areas. I had to hot glue it back together. Also had to add glue to keep the hat from falling off of the headband completely.
2.0,"Product Description specifically states:  ""Machine Washable...do not iron... tumble dry low.""<br /><br />This is why I purchased this item, as opposed to similar items.<br /><br />Tag inside garment states:<br /><br />""Hand Wash"", ""iron inside out to shape"" and ""Do not tumble dry""<br /><br />It's completely opposite of what was advertised."
2.0,It's nice and long.<br />That's about it. Very thin!! Not lined. Ok for Halloween. I could of made it better
2.0,I ended up returning these. I love the concept but they are just not comfortable. The sizing was a challenge for me; either too bulky or felt like my finger was suffocating.
2.0,Corre grande es mejor pedir un size menos
2.0,"Purchased this belt for my husband around Christmas time. This weekend it broke! Meaning it only last about four months... so I wouldn’t recommend it for your go-to, everyday, belt. The tongue piece that goes through the hole snapped off! Very disappointed."
2.0,Looks huge... Not true to size.
2.0,"Fabric is nice. I’m 5’7, about 165lbs and 36DD, the length is good but the pleating at top of the dress sits in the middle of my boobs - looks kind of awkward"
2.0,"This bag felt almost plastic. It looked very cheap. I was disappointed, but since I purchased it to make a gift, I had to make it work."
2.0,Es material demaciado fragil. La mia se trozo.
2.0,"Really loved the navy blue and pink in the picture but unfortunately this is a very obvious bad bad bad screen print the background color is more of a light gray and the dinos are not even pink. You get what you pay for, so I should have lowered my expectations greatly for this price."
2.0,These were ok but way to small... These are for people with little heads
2.0,"I ordered the black pants with the rainbow stripe.  The pants i received were a lot different than what i expected, based on the product pictures.  The pictures portray the pants as more of a jogger style, loose at the ankles, thin athletic material, and not tight fitting. The pants i received are leggings, skin-tight, and very thick and stiff material.  They don't look awful on, but the material isn't comfortable and even the xl doesn't cover enough of my backside for me to sit down without showing some crack.  I'll be returning these."
2.0,"I loved the color and look of these bras, but unfortunately, they offered no support at all and my boobs were spilling  out. I had to return them, sadly."
2.0,"I like this dress, but the pockets are in an odd place.  They are on the hips & should be lower.  It also fits a little smaller than I expected.  I bought a L & think it fits more like a M."
2.0,"Loved the fit and material but is definitely see through, maybe could try sizing up but im 5'2 and 120lbs i dont think a larger size would fit the same. Dont recommend this color."
2.0,Love the light pink. The band looks & feels just like the one that came with my fitbit. But it only lasted about 2 weeks before it was stained and dirty looking even after I cleaned it. Maybe a darker color would have been better.
2.0,Short strap
2.0,Buckle broke inside of a week. Leather band itself was nice and impressive for the price
2.0,Slippers run one size small.
2.0,"I really liked the shoes but the sizing and description where problematic. I wear a foot brace that usually fits into a (8.5) wide shoe. So that's what I ordered. This product runs small in comparison to shoes I purchased from other manufacturers. I could not get the foot pad of my brace to fit comfortably into this shoe. The problem was either the product running small or the fact I was sent an 8.5 wide Women's shoe. I imagine they run smaller. When I ordered, I did not see any reference to Men's or Women's. Because I did like the shoes and they are the type of shoe I'm looking for, I did re-order another larger pair. I'm hoping for the best."
2.0,Uncomfortable fit around finger. Scratchy and not finished edges.
2.0,"I bought these to protect my son’s feet in swimming lessons, as he has some nerve damage and will not feel pain in his toes, and so will scrape and tear up his toes on the bottom of the pool without knowing it.  These were a bit hard to get on, but worked great for the first few times.  Unfortunately they now have holes through the soles near the toe on both feet, after only 4 or 5 uses in a pool."
2.0,Not long as pictured in the photo. I’m 5’6 and it hits right at my shins. I was expecting the ankle/heel length.
2.0,The whole focus of this hat is the feather. Save your money—this hat arrived smashed in a bag with the feather broken into three pieces.
2.0,"I purchased this item thinking it would look fantastic but, was disapointed when i saw that the pendant was very small and that it did not have the engraving design on both sides i wish i had never bought this pendant but, too late i am stuck with it."
2.0,"Runs small, I normally wear women's 4-6 but I  bought a large because I know a lot of the clothes run on the smaller side. This dress barely zipped. I only bought it as part of a costume but I would not buy it as an every day dress"
2.0,The graphic on the t-shirt was cracked when it finally arrived later than stated when purchased.  The size is almost a size and a half small.
2.0,These pants were not athletic material at all!!!  They were stiff. My son wouldn’t even try them on as they weren’t flexible/comfortable.
2.0,Broke in one week of having it..
2.0,I like the look but this product is not large enough around for a normal size man's risk.
2.0,Put in an exhalation valve then cover with 2 layers of cloth still can't breath any better.  and they are really not that soft either.
2.0,Cheap but expected for the cost.
2.0,"Does not snap well to watch, leaves gap and the watch catches wrist often"
2.0,Cute but more like a legging than pants.
2.0,Only one earring showed up.. Suppose to be a pair..
2.0,My wife is a little disappointed some of them tore right at the gusset
2.0,Looks great in photos. Cheap in person
2.0,It looks nice till you put it on.  The shoulders are wider than normal and the armpits hang down.  The body of the dress is body-con and very form fitting.  What a shame because it is cute but the shoulder and arms of the dress are cut odd and are too large.  If you look at the last picture of the model with hand on hip and the purse on the other shoulder you will see how the armpit area hangs to low and looks unattractive.
2.0,"It came in a bit too small, but I expected that. What I didn't expect is a button to fall off on the first wash, poor stitching, and for it to develop a hole on the side out of nowhere.  Save your money and go somewhere else."
2.0,"This is neat how you can see all the words in the stone, and pretty, but it bent out of shape within one day."
2.0,They look ok but when I put on they slid right down. Definitely not made for medium to small females.
2.0,Too small.... hangs a lot lower in the back than the photo depicts.
2.0,This dress is poorly made and doesn’t have any bandage appeal
2.0,The frames were correct but the lenses we definitely not mirrored as pictured. Extremely see through.
2.0,"Even though these flip-flops are quite bulky, they fit smaller than you would expect because of the way they are molded. I got them in my true size and they are too short both in the heel and in the front with the toes. In fact the front is especially bad - the way that mold goes up, these flip-flops are made for extremely short toes. It is very uncomfortable to walk in these since you can't straighten out your toes.<br />I am giving the flip-flops two stars because the material is actually good - these definitely had potential. Perhaps I'll try to cut down the front so as to make a flat surface for my toes, and if successful, wear them at home."
2.0,"It was not very tall, we were looking for a tall top hat. Was on the short side, but otherwise decent quality."
2.0,"As much as a nurse washes hands, your going to get water on your watch.  Continues to get water on the inside of the crystal.  Otherwise, decent watch."
2.0,"I got the red shorts and here's my thoughts on them.<br /><br />The first things I noticed when I first got these swim shorts is the material and the number on the side of the leg.  As for the latter issue, the number was very small, about the size of a silver dollar - not the giant collegiate-looking one in the picture - so the look is definitely not as cool in my opinion.<br /><br />Secondly, the material is very loose and cheap feeling.  It feels like a cheap track suit and theres a certain gaudy sheen to the color/material as well - doesn't at all seem like swim wear - it honestly feels more like what a male go-go dancer would wear not only in the way it looks but how the material feels as well.<br /><br />I haven't swam in them yet but at this point I really don't want to.  The shorts are shiny and I don't want to project the false image that I'm gay at the pool because that's how I look in these flashy shorts.  Not what I expected at all."
2.0,Too short and fits weird at the top.
2.0,Slacks were returned.  Did not like cut.
2.0,The dress fit great and was comfortable but incredibly see through. I couldn't even wear it without something over the top of it
2.0,The color scheme of this hoodie is portrayed VERY different online verses what you see in real life. It is unflattering and I won’t be ordering from this company again. It also took two months to get here and that was before the pandemic hit..
2.0,Two of the briefs had small holes in the front.
2.0,"I loved these and they worked well for a photo shoot - but within a month, the beaded strands began falling out."
2.0,I have thin arms upper and lower and  I  couldn’t get my arms into sleeves without stretching the fabric beyond its max. Upper arm section so small it would only suit someone with very slender upper arms.
2.0,"This jacket didn't fit right. Instead of looking like a Miami gambler, I was more of a mad lab scientist. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"This shirt is not a slim fit and the design is uneven. Very unhappy with the product, but will not go fhru the hassle of returning it.<br />Gave two stars because it arrived on time."
2.0,This coat is a LOT smaller than another coat I have which is labeled as a whole size smaller than this one. I bought this one to get something ... larger.  It's going back.
2.0,They are pretty thick not too thick but they don’t absorb as much as i thought drool kind of sits on top they are cute but need more absorbing
2.0,"la apariencia es buena y se ven bien lamentablemente las ruedas son una pesadilla en cada viaje se rompe una ya perdi la primera maleta completa ,no se si se pueden adquirir ruedas de repuesto, pero en todo caso ,no son durables es la verdad."
2.0,It is a lot shorter than expected.  I'm hoping I can expand it with either a bit of chain or twine.  I've come to realize that there is an influx of Asian products being offered in the states.  This is the second time I've been disappointed with an overseas purchase ase.
2.0,The hijab material is nice and light and airy. But it's poorly stitched a string fell off my first time wearing it. Looks nothing like the pic. My daughter will be using it as a head wrap for her baby doll.
2.0,They are small 🙁. I need them for work and I needed free movement
2.0,Expected it to give a push up look like in the pictures. The lines show through any shirt
2.0,"I am so confused...Dress is cute as can be, love the fit, but there is zero lining/shell.  The 100% polyester is completely see through.  Slip will be needed.  I haven't worn a slip in forever. haha"
2.0,"The fabric is not very soft and was was rather stiff. I normally wear size small, but this was too small for what I was looking for. This will be returned."
2.0,"The actual design is so much smaller than I expected and you can barely make out the design detail.  Also, they DO NOT expand to a size 9 ~ maybe an 8 if that."
2.0,I ordered this shirt in an extra large because I wanted it loose...I normally wear a medium...this shirt fits as if it was a small...
2.0,A bit more taller cloth part than per picture (almost to the point of a chef's hat rather than chauffeur type). Otherwise it is what it is but visor already cracking and looks a bit cheesy.
2.0,"When the earrings came, there were only two pair on the holder. The green ones were not included. Disappointing for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift."
2.0,"The shorts were ok, but the top was terrible. Not well made, cheap, too big, no support. Would not buy again"
2.0,"I own three pairs of Clic now: - Standard (these seem to be made the strongest/best of all three), - XXL (which probably fit my big head the best although the build quality of that pair lead to premature failure), and these XL (newest pair and my least favorite of them all).<br /><br />Standard have lasted for years even if I had to superglue the side hinges long ago after those crapped out. I still wear them, but they fit so close on either side of my head they hurt after a bit.<br /><br />The XXL lasted a few months before falling apart at both sides (again superglued back to working condition) but also the rear hinge just gave up the ghost once too much. Too man moving parts, but at least this pair did not put pressure on either side of my head. $40 for readers that last a few months though puts pressure on the wallet.<br /><br />Then I saw these XL with no sliding back hinge thing. I guessed (incorrectly) these Clics would be the ones. No way, no way, no way these fit any larger than the standard. I can't wear these for more than 15 minutes at a time. They literally put indention marks on either side of my head. Maybe my big head is shaped differently than other big heads? Can't imagine, but something is not right. Plus, the plastic and construction of the frames and lens seems much less robust than vs my other pair. That could be because these are see though gray though they just feel cheaper.<br /><br />I don't feel its fair to send these back to Amazon for Clics sizing wonkiness, so I will probably just go back to my standard size pair and give these to the next person smaller headed person who asks about the cool click design readers. The design and ability to always have these around your neck and available is the bees knees, so there is a positive in an otherwise negative sammich. (Sorry for being negative since the world is drowning in it these days.)<br /><br />Pic explanation: hard to hold the pairs exactly on top of one another (XL over std) and take a pic, but in real life it is more obvious that the slightly extended hinge actually pushes the frames back at a more aggressive angle pushing against my temple area. Wondering now if I can use some hot water and DIY-change the contour of the rigid back piece to give me some relief. Maybe."
2.0,Love the ear rings however they came without backs
2.0,These are pretty but they are not to be used for protection.  I bought them based on someone else's review because it said there was a protective pad that you can put into the mask but there is no protection pad or a place where you can put a pad.  The only thing you can do is wear a mask under this one and use this one for decoration.
2.0,Was a little small for my face
2.0,Not worth the $12 and sadly they already broke. Very cheap looking.
2.0,"Strange fit. High weird fit at waist, cut specifically for people with larger thighs and hips, and not at all what it looks like in the photos"
2.0,Very unflattering. No shape at all and just hangs on my body like a muumuu
2.0,"I have to give this product two stars, because it doesn't fulfill the main purpose I bought them for: being able to withstand extremely cold temperatures. Let's talk about the positives first.<br /><br />I will start by saying I am a forklift operator, so I deal with the elements 7 hours a day.  I wasn't able to test the waterproof property of these gloves, but they are definitely windproof. I've had gloves in the past that tore after two weeks, but the material of these gloves are of a higher quality and I expect them to last a long time. The fleece lining is soft, but not too soft for my masculine hands. Being able to use a touchsceen is nice, but not an essential feature for me. My size was a perfect fit. I can barely palm a basketball as a reference to my hand size.<br /><br />Not for the bad news. These gloves are allegedly able to ""withstand"" -30 F temperatures. I've so far only used these gloves in sub 30 degree weather and after ""only"" an hours or two, my fingertips feel cold, swollen and numb. They don't feel completely numb, but I have no idea how someone would last -30 degree temperatures, unless they are only outside for 15-30 minutes. If you work outside in the cold for hours at a time, Do. Not. Get. These. Gloves. I am current in search for better gloves. I might get battery-powered hand warmers, because I'm getting sick of tossing my money away."
2.0,Turned green Ina week and didn't even slightly resemble a cat!!
2.0,"Shame was cute on, but cheaply made wAY too stretchy even for size small didn't cover chest because stretches too much"
2.0,There was nothing wrong with these bags.  I was looking for a lined wet bag and this is not lined.
2.0,"Fell apart within two weeks. Liner pulled out within days. Terrible quality, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,The bracelets break very easily.
2.0,"Ok dress, but would not wear to dressy occasion. I’m a size 12 an$ it as tight. I ended up returning it."
2.0,The extra lenses do not fit properly they fall out every time you remove the glasses from your head the side pieces fall out sporadically. And the lens of scratch very easily.
2.0,"The crop top is kinda long and the XL is like a men's XL, not a women's, their XL is more like a women's 3x. The material is weak enough that you can pop a finger through it if you're not careful. But after cutting it down and shortening it, it's become a decent shirt while it lasts."
2.0,"I bought these to mostly wear around the house. The sizing is off, and each one provides very little support. I probably could have ordered a size or two down and gotten better compression. The straps are super long for some reason, and the only one of the pack that sort of tries to hold things in is the grey one. I actually laugh out loud thinking about what a horror show these would be even during minimal-movement workouts. Things would be going everywhere. You definitely get what you pay for here (and maybe a little less)."
2.0,"see through, beware,"
2.0,"AT first I was very satisfied with the comfort and fit. However, after a couple of weeks, the seam up from the side slits came undone and the corset was ruined. So of course I am not satisfied. I think the two side slits with ribbon tie-ups is a bad idea. I bought this at the same time as the Camelias 26-boned normal-length corset, which has held up fine and is a much better value than this one."
2.0,"This lanyard is very cute and stylish. It goes with almost everything, which is huge when you have to wear it everyday. However, the magnetic clasp turns green after limited wear. This leaves a green mark on the back of your neck. Unfortunately, this happened very quickly after the first use."
2.0,"This is great because it's made from cotton. However, it is made way to small. The bottom of my breasts were out of bra. The shoulder to breast area was way to short. Might fit a young girl of 12 but not an adult."
2.0,"The dots are huge bright white circles, looks nothing like the print shown in the photograph. The dress advertised also looks higher quality with different colored piping around the top. The pockets were oddly low. Ended up returning."
2.0,"Material is lower quality than expected. One wash and they fell apart at the band. I wear a 32 and got a 34 after reading reviews. The 34’s were too large. Stick with your size if you’re going to get them. They’re not worth the money, in my opinion."
2.0,"These are way too small and the description is a lie. Outer STRETCHES. What kind of cow (or any animal) has stretchy skin? Rip off, i have many pairs of REAL leather gloves, wear different pairs outside to keep warm. CHARGE twice as much, ok. But not for plastic. :-/"
2.0,I had to return the cardigan due to poor quality. Did not like it at all.
2.0,It was sent with a defect in the fabric
2.0,Cute dress. I thought would be a full dress. Very short.
2.0,"Soft material and comfy top, but the bottom was smaller than expected and more high waisted than I thought. The bottoms were uncomfortable and not something I’d want to lounge around in."
2.0,Didn't really like the optics of the lenses.  There seemed to be a distortion in the lens. Plus the polarization / tint wasn't nearly as high quality as the originals.
2.0,"I needed this for nursing school since we can no longer wear wrist watches. I was so happy with it the first 2 times I wore it,  then the date stopped working. The date is the reason I got this perticular watch. I'm so disappointed.  Does keep accurate time...but not accurate date."
2.0,"These are cute. The XS fits snuggly (like leggings) but comfortably (I'm 5'2&#34; and 105 lbs). I initially ordered them, though, because Amazon listed them as 97% cotton, and I was looking for some nice breathable summer pants that I could wear during a summer heat wave. But the ones I received are 97% polyester instead. I dunno--I may not return them but just look for something else because I can see myself wearing them on non-heat-wave days."
2.0,huge for my taste.
2.0,"The whole bracelet is cheap and homely looking.  I glued a hello kitty float charm on the cats head and that made the bracelet at least less ugly and one of my granddaughters said,""Oh that's better""."
2.0,Does not look the same as picture. Looks extremely cheap. Would not recommend. If you've ever purchased clothes off of something like Wish the quality is the same.
2.0,The material rolls up does not really what it says.
2.0,"Great fit, however the color wears off within a week."
2.0,Enormous!!!!!!!!!!!
2.0,"The fabric is nice and it looks like the picture but it doesn't have shape to it, and felt too large and unflattering. I returned it."
2.0,Not your normal pajama fabric. Feels cheap and heavy. Spend your money elsewhere.
2.0,This looks nice but the band broke away from one of the watch attachment ends after only a few days of use.
2.0,Was too small got a 14 15 still was too small
2.0,I really like the look of these but I don't like that the lenses are hard to see through. They aren't very clear and seem to be foggy no matter how much you clean them. This makes you strain whenever you wear them.
2.0,It isn’t very soft and has a weird fit especially in the arm area. I’m returning.
2.0,My daughter received this luggage set as a graduation gift but the wheel and corner of the smallest suitcase already ripped off after just two trips.  Now that Amazon no longer carries this product I'm not sure what my recourse and I don't know how to reach the seller. I am not the one that ordered it - CoolLife Customer Support - if you are reading this please contact me through my amazon account!  The order number from my sister in law's account was:  Order # 113-8401278-2591.  Thank you
2.0,"I ordered this thinking it would be really cool, but honestly I was pretty disappointed.<br />The were pretty saggy and did not look like they did on the model. If you were to purchase, I would definitely size up, it does run quite small in the waist.<br />I ordered these for a rave to match with my friends, but I don't think I would ever wear these again."
2.0,"32-inch waist and this didn't come close to fitting. It was also much shorter than it appears in the picture, I'm 5-7 and it was barely knee-length when sitting at my natural waist."
2.0,"There is another company that has exact same shirts, but they are much longer and better quality. This shirt was way too short, although the material and the floral print is very nice. If you are petite and short, this would be perfect."
2.0,It was cute and fit as expected but the strap broke off after wearing it for ~30 min.
2.0,The product wasn't what I expected it couldn't be use for purpose intend
2.0,It looks completely diffy from the pictures. It looks cheap.
2.0,"poor quality, while the design is ok."
2.0,"The pants were to long and the top was a little small. I have decided to keep them for awhile. The color was okay. The material I thought would be of a warmer material, since that's what I was looking for at the time I ordered them."
2.0,Cup was a b maybe. Even with a extra large. No support. Disappointing
2.0,could not wear
2.0,"Item returned because mask didn’t fit face. The straps for ears are a bit small and design of mask fit a particular type of face. Also since ear straps are not adjustable, wasn’t able to modify at all to fit properly."
2.0,Gloves were actually green in color
2.0,This sweatshirt is very thin. It is not meant to be warm.
2.0,After i got this bracelet it looks the same in the picture but on the metal it looks rusty on some parts and i didnt even wear it when i noticed the rust.
2.0,"Received the package and was excited. Upon opening up the sealed bag an overbearing fishy smell emerged! It was pungent and awful. I ordered 2, one for myself in a s/m and another for my mother in a l/xl. I could not get the s/m to zip up properly. The l/xl fit better but even then the zipper won’t stay up all the way, it sometimes zips down a few inches; my suggestion is to size up! I worked out for an hour and didn’t get the sweaty result I was expecting. It felt warmer around my midsection and back but no sweat. I’ve had better results with other types of sweat bands. I can say it’s thin and comfy enough to wear under clothing. Just glad I did not pay full price."
2.0,"I bought this for Halloween purposes, and the tank top is really really big. It's a thicker quality, and it doesn't add a good shape to your body."
2.0,These earrings are beautiful but impossible to insert .
2.0,"the straps over top and bottom really seemed useless and the shoulder straps being connected to the bottom of the bag vrs the waist belt made the bag set funny against my back.  the bag is good for storage but with the added straps  and lack of exterior pockets made this not a bag to use if you need to access much in a hurry (such as range finder, wind direction powder, cell phone...things I may want handy..  the one open side pocket is a bit big for a water bottle and if using for that you risk pulling much more out to fall on the ground when reaching and pulling out the water bottle while on the move"
2.0,dial is hard to read the time and poor quality! the cost of this watch should be half of what they ask for it.
2.0,Go up at least 2 sizes. Crazy small and soft. I did like the non-working buttons but could barely get it over my head.
2.0,The hat was some what small
2.0,Does not fit like picture shows.  This is not what I consider a sweatshirt.
2.0,"still has a plastic hinge, which is where they break apart after you sit on them a few times."
2.0,The necklace was missing a butterfly charm& some were facing the wrong way. My daughters bday was the following day so I had to adjust them myself. She liked it but has no idea the work I had to put in to make it look wearable.
2.0,"La tela es muy dura y no tiene buena caida, lo unico que se ve lindo es el broderi. lLo regale"
2.0,"I purchased this face mask because I suffer for HORRIBLE allergies.  The mask I ordered had black ties-the one I received had white ties.  This may not be an issue for some people, but for me it was because the ties rub on the sides of my face and my makeup rubbed off on them, making the ties look dirty/dingy (which is why I ordered the mask with the black ties).  The mask itself is pretty thick with the filter insert, which makes breathing difficult. If you want to wear this while exercising outdoors, forget it.  I purchased this for that reason and I literally couldn't breathe with the mask on (I removed the filter insert but the mask itself has several layers of thick fabric so it still didn't work well).<br />Lastly, the first time I washed it (linen bag, cold cycle) and air dry, it shrunk-to the point that it is pretty much unwearable."
2.0,"It does not stay in place like it says it does.  The adhesive is itchy, I'm not impressed with this product."
2.0,"Product did not come in any specific sizes, only small, medium, large etc. pants received were way to long."
2.0,3 year old just took them off jacket on first day.  Great idea and quality was fine didn't work out for us.
2.0,"Didn't fit, half the cost of socks to return - read the fine print"
2.0,"The tie is right under my chest and isn’t a very flattering fit with my larger chest. Ordered a size up based on reviews, and it was still small in the chest area. I bought this for a Beetlejuice costume, and I don’t think I’m going to wear it. Will most likely return based on sizing issue and not flattering fit. I didn’t care for the silky type material."
2.0,Stones were falling out ... I wanted to give it as a gift but now I can't
2.0,good.....looking nice
2.0,The masks are for children and they are not large enough for adults.
2.0,"I like the design but the faded graphic is not the same as advertised, the outline on &#34;Freedom&#34; is clearly not there and you can hardly see the graphic."
2.0,A bunch of these didn't work right out of the box. Others died or broke quickly after a few uses. The ones that did work were cool and very bright. You get what you pay for here.
2.0,I thought these were cute when I seen em online but didn’t like in person since they were more rigid for “dangle” earrings than I expected & the pearls looked a little tarnished.
2.0,Cozy but unless you want to remove lintballs from ALL over each time I suggest a better quality material
2.0,"pendent is very beautiful, however the chain that came with broke w/in 20mins of wearing it."
2.0,"This skirt is not a brushed blended fabric. It's more like shiny 80s polyester - think elementary school teacher outfit from back in the day. I'm petite, but this is way long even for a short person. There is also a seam in the back, as well as the sides? It's unfortunate because it's very unflattering and obvious."
2.0,The watch is attractive and cute but band came apart the Very time I wore it. Very poor workmanship.
2.0,Good item but over priced for cheap plastic
2.0,arrived with stones missing.
2.0,These look like 2 plastic bags over your shoes.  Ugly and cheap as can be.
2.0,VERY short waisted / low cut.  Mine did not come up as high as the picture.  Can't wear these.
2.0,"They are soft, but will they breathe?  Bought as lounge wear, but not flattering if anyone came to the door.  Crotch shows camel toe, and top is baggy and I’ve an hour glass shape.  Pretty pink though."
2.0,This track suit material was not as it appears on the web-site.
2.0,It turnd my neck green. Lol
2.0,No lace that I could see. Otherwise fine.
2.0,"Dress was boxy, with excess material around waist and hips. Not flattering. Cute pattern."
2.0,This is definitely asian sizing. One size larger will not cut it. Unless you are a medium (in which you would get the XXL) you probably want to skip this one. To get it &#34;flowy&#34; you'd have to be extremely small indeed.<br /><br />It's also very short. Very short. The model in the picture could not possibly be taller than about 5'2&#34;<br /><br />It also has a pretty harsh chemical smell and will need to be laundered before it can be worn.<br /><br />I can't give only one star because they DID warn that it ran small. I just completely misinterpreted how small they meant. Since that's on me they get an extra star. The smell prevents me from going any higher.<br /><br />I have a short thin daughter. I will probably pass this on to her (if the smell washes out).
2.0,"Strap broke when first put on.  Do not know if this was poor quality control on this pair or a systemic problem.<br /><br />Of course, Amazon was great with the return and refund."
2.0,"Nice lightweight and well-made shirt, good arm length, but much smaller than other shirts of the same size that I’ve purchased."
2.0,"necklace chain broke the first time I wore it. I was able to fix the chain but it has since broke 2 separate times at different places in the chain. it is a very cute necklace, just extremely poor quality"
2.0,Good quality for the dress. It was just too big. Unfortunately I had to return it. The customer service I received was great!
2.0,The bows were hot glued on. Thankfully my mom had a sewing kit with black thread so they’re on good now. I do give it 2 stars though because the material is like tights material and they didn’t run at all even though i yanked them up pretty hard all day.
2.0,"You indicated these were &#34;one size&#34; jeans. Well, I am slim and 5'5&#34; (weighing 130) and these jeans are too small.  I have decided to keep them to wear around my house for my husband, but they fit way too snug for me to wear outdoors.  Think you need to rethink sizing.  Love the material, the fleecing is very comfortable."
2.0,To big asked for small but it fit like a medium
2.0,"The only problem is it has,a wierd smell that I hope doesn't transfer to my clothes"
2.0,"Super cute, but majorly flawed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* band is solid and thick<br />* pearl is a nice large size<br />Cons:<br />* the closure is the WORST.<br />first pair ordered the one earring didn’t close. Red flag. second pair, same issue.<br />* pearls aren’t set so they move all over the place -  closing the earring putting can be tricky<br /><br />They are so cute but probably won’t last bc of the closure of the earring.  Wish me luck with the two working earrings. Lol."
2.0,So big it would have fallen off shrek’s finger.
2.0,I bought the Bombas and they are very snug on your feet which is fine but they pull on your toes and it hurts after a while. When putting on your sneakers the back part of the sock bunches up it doesn’t stay down. They become very uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,"If you got pierced with a piercing gun like me and don't frequently wear heavy earrings that could stretch out your piercing holes, you probably won't be able to wear these. I don't know what gauge they are but the posts are quite thick. I was able to somehow painlessly get them into my right ear, but my left ear bled from trying to get these in."
2.0,"These are such cute shoes! However the sizing completely confused me. Looking at the size chart I saw W for women's and M men's and they didn't have my size in womens but they did have smaller men's shoes so I went with a men's 6 to equal up to about a woman's 8 right? When I received my shoes they looked way smaller than I expected, almost like kids shoes. Very disappointed, but I will be giving them another shot and ordering a size or two up. Wish me luck."
2.0,The headbands and glasses are made inexpensively.  One headband arrived broken.  Not going to return it because for the price I paid I’m going to make them work.  More suited for child sized heads than adults.
2.0,"They arrives with bent posts. Like z shaped. Pretty, but cheaply made."
2.0,I sent it back but did not get the credit to my account!  If I do not hear from you soon I will contact my bank!<br />Rosemary Krieger
2.0,Loved it when I first bought them. Tarnished after wearing it. Can't return it. Kinda Sad. :(
2.0,Didn’t fit on my large 5 year old daughter or my head correctly…
2.0,This tore like tissues in a gymnast's bra on prom night
2.0,MUCH smaller than expected. Didn’t wear.
2.0,"Sucks,  im a 38D and when i got the bra there is hardly any padding,  when i pull the draw strings it just makes me look flat chested with a line down the middle of my chest. Doesnt make my boobs look any better"
2.0,"First, my dress does not look like pictured.  I bought the blue and white.  At the bottom, they show the models legs showing through -- supercute little detail.  Mine did not have that cut out stripe along the skirt, just a cheap band of blue around the bottom...  Also, material of the dress feels cheap and a little nasty against the skin.  All in all, not my fav."
2.0,"Poorly made , the  air  pipe nozzle  came broken"
2.0,"At first I was very pleased with the lenses and how dark they were but After two months of use and cleaning, the mirror coating has started to fade/peel away. I am really disappointed with the duration of the coating. I will have to find another set now."
2.0,Has a double hook in the back that makes it extremely difficult to clasp.
2.0,Wasn't the best quality
2.0,the open part at top of boot was to small I could not get foot in without struggle Im sorry that they didn't work
2.0,Gave away as presents since to small for me even though I ordered extra large
2.0,"The material is not as advertised. It is shiny, very tight spandex. The description says it is for work, which is not true, unless you work at a gym. It says that it is loose, but this actually is made to fit tight on the body due to high amount of spandex. Very disappointed. I gave it 2 stars because of the nice colors."
2.0,Beautiful to look at but the gold does not last. Gold color changed after 4 wear.
2.0,"The bar that goes through your ear is very flimsy. I pushed the back into it and it wouldn't fit on. Cute earrings, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Very thin material. More like tights than leggings.
2.0,The head strap is very weak and broke within two days.
2.0,It's was alright
2.0,"Underwear are true to size and very good material.<br />The only thing is that three pairs of underwear had holes where the elastic band is. I wanted to return them, but then I didn't feel it would be appropriate for me to send back underwear with holes."
2.0,"says that the product runs big so order down a size.  I didn't, and the product was extremely small.  I couldn't even comfortably fit the product over my head."
2.0,It does not work with my watches. It’s not built for large face watches. My watch keeps scratching against the top glass
2.0,Decent but runs big and is thin material. Does not &#34;fit&#34; like you see in picture
2.0,"Loved the look of this! My boyfriend was looking for a new watch and we both loved this one. I was delighted when I opened up the box and it was packaged nicely. The actual box the watch came in was protected by packing materials. As well as it had a peel off on the face to protect from scratches. Sadly my boyfriend only got to wear it for 10 minutes before it broke, while he was driving. The clasp fell off and came undone from his wrist. Just wish this product held up"
2.0,Pants falls off my son after washing it a few times! real Junk!
2.0,they are very warm and sleek but if i had known they were this cheap and poorly made i would've spent the extra for the other pair I was considering. the FIRST time i put the gloves one of the straps for the bows snapped off. the touch fingers also completely suck. just take it off and text its much easier. i had alot of hope for these gloves but as i sit here deciding whether to rip the other bows off or sew this one back on (too much trouble to send back for what i paid for them) i gotta say Im a little disappointed.
2.0,Tight at the waist
2.0,"Mine had scatches on the lenses and these look used.  I don't have proof these are used but if they are new then the quality control is horrible.  Apart from the above, the glasses are comfortable to put on and assuming that they do block the advertised ranges then these should work.  I want to find a way to non-destructively test if they work."
2.0,They're adorable. I love them. However one of the plastic pieces that rests on the nose fell off within the first couple of days and now I can't wear them anymore. I loved these so much!! :(
2.0,The waist is horrible along with the compressions. My groin region is busting through the shorts and compressions and it’s not the most flattering when you’re trying to do squats at the gym. Wouldn’t suggest buying
2.0,I ordered 200 Finger Lights and 34 of them did not work.  They are poor quality and I wouldn't buy these again.
2.0,"I just got my bolo tie in and am rather displeased. I suppose it is ultimately my own fault for not reading the description better. Or more accurately, paying attention to what wasn't in the description. The neck cord is made of braided nylon. The clips that hold the strings are not crimped evenly, nor do they allow the string to slide. All in all I would not recommend this product, nor will I purchase again. I have to regularly teach myself this lesson over and over again... you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I understand that this is an oversized style but the fit is just not right!  Definitely go a size down!  It almost looks like bathrobe.  The material is ok, more on the thin side and it sheds a lot!  I am keeping it just to wear around in the house."
2.0,"I bought this to replace one I had that was getting a little worn out. I thought it was from the same seller, but not, and it runs small. It also wasn’t eligible for a regular Amazon return. So, to send it back would cost more than the shirt itself...so I am stuck with a shirt that doesn’t fit. Very disappointed."
2.0,Super cheap!!! Poor craftsmanship
2.0,"Watch when buying because this item runs really small, ended up returning pants."
2.0,Didn't wear well - nose piece broke within two wears.
2.0,Bought 2 packs. One seemed fine. Other had difficulty getting the sticky film off
2.0,It was too small and short in the waist.  I returned it.
2.0,Cute earrings. But they are always popping open. I don’t want to wear them because I’m worried I’ll lose one.
2.0,I ordered this for my dad. The hat was too small for his head. My8 yr old tried it on but it was a little small for him too.<br />The chain for the clock was broke upon receipt<br />The rest seems fine but cheaply made
2.0,"When I first got this I loved It but sadly after a month and little wear time, this started to tarnish horribly. A lot of the added charms have broken and fallen off."
2.0,Not as the picture.
2.0,The product arrived with bent studs. These are costume jewelry. They look nice from a few feet away. Suitable for children in early teens who are prone to losing things.
2.0,"This sandal/ slipper is not what I expected. It is a good concept for those of us who have bunions. But poorly designed so it does not work as intended. It is bulky and does not fit snug around the big toe to “pull” it. The bottom sole also is not flexible. It has not give. It feels and sounds like I’m walking on hard styrofoam. The top material is nice and nice color.<br />Since they are not worth returning, I wear them as slippers in the house while I am in the kitchen."
2.0,"It came with several scratches.  No peel off protective film.  The hole was poorly drilled and had metal burrs.  Maybe I just got a bad one, but even without those problems, it would be way overpriced for what you get"
2.0,Doesn't look anything like picture and the wrong size. I love wood gauges and these seem just fine. I just think I got the wrong pair.
2.0,A little bigger than expected. Returned because it wasn’t flattering.
2.0,I would look elsewhere as the material is very thin and unless you plan on using it once. Full disclosure I sent it back for a refund given that. I like the ability to reuse it and also prefer something thicker to keep its shape.
2.0,"Looks big but its too small, be aware order a num er bigger. Took also a long time to get"
2.0,looks cheap. does job but doesn't look good with precious metal jewelry.
2.0,These look great and I love how well I can see with them but the squeeze my head so tightly I cannot wear them without getting a headache.  If you have a skinny head they'll probably be great.
2.0,"Loved these when I first put them on and for the first few wears. They were comfortable and looked great! Unfortunately, they got a massive run within the first week."
2.0,No es lo que esperaba está muy grande
2.0,Thin material and not what I expected for the price.
2.0,"Too bulky for a hoodie, felt like I was wearing a blanket. And the hood had too much material, basically in the way and uncomfortable."
2.0,"The floral beads are nice, but the silver charms are NOT as pictured. The silver beads are almost black, not pretty! The bracket comes apart of it's own accord. Spend a bit more, because you get what you pay for. CHEAP!"
2.0,"Dress was short in length, which lead to my return. Had it been longer, I would have kept it. It fit well around my body, but stopped above my ankles. I am 5'6&#34; just to give an idea."
2.0,"These are super cute, but they are getting a hole first time wearing them. Bummed"
2.0,Slippers were great for the first month then they rapidly lost their shape and I kept on tripping.
2.0,Appear to be quality and look like they'd last. Had these fit based on the sizing chart they would have been great. Unfortunately they were huge. Love the color and material. Did not like the sizing or baggy ankles. It recommended that you order a size down in these.
2.0,"Will likely like this more when I get more used to it. Might get to feeling comfy. I'm a rank uke beginner, and was wanting to feel as comfortable as playing my guitar (old timer.) I do like the colors. Can't tell if the leash is small or meant to ride high on the chest. The plastic adjustable &#34;buckle&#34; can rub and even click against back of my uke, as if something's not quite right. Tried other configs, right arm through the loop, etc., but need more tether. (I'm ave. size female.) The plastic hook is too tight and I'm afraid of scratching surface of my lovely new tenor. But it can fit under strings and lay sideways along the hole, in a secure way. Once I get over the sense I'm doing something wrong, I'll like it more. And do appreciate what support it gives, to play standing and even seated. Feel free to comment if you see where I'm missing the point. Thanks.<br /><br />Update 7 months later (10-20-17.) Still awkward for me, but dh purchased a leather clip-on &#34;bracelet&#34; that loops just above the nut, making a place to attach the plastic hook (under strings near tuners.) The circular part of strap could go behind back and over same side or opposite (right) shoulder. But it just doesn't feel good, too tight (I'm med. size adult female.) Looks like I'll have to break down and make a hole for a real strap..."
2.0,"I used the rod to transport our clothing for a three month trip and used the ends that fit over the hand holds in the car.  The plastic ends quickly bent and slipped off the hand holds when fully loaded.  The metal loop that fits over the clothing hook in the car is very substantial but would bend if I put the load on them for the trip.  It is a very substantial rod, adjusts easily but unless you are just carrying a light load it probably is a questionable purchase."
2.0,Short in the crotch as well as small.
2.0,Too small for women. Better for a young teenager
2.0,I like the color but I dislike the size it fits one size smaller am keeping it cuz I like the dress although I would of preferred it been more loose and I hate returns since I order too many of them I just hate dealing with returns
2.0,The product picture clearly says original buckle. That’s not what I got.
2.0,Diamonds fell out not even 24 hours of wearing it and receiving it. Disappointed
2.0,Fits horribly and very impractical. thought it would be a lot better quality.
2.0,Too small. Junior or kids size maybe?
2.0,Not sure how this got a 4.5 stars... it is good quality but has the weirdest waistline.... it was not flattering to say the least.
2.0,I’m 5’4 and the pants didn’t even touch my shoes .
2.0,Bought Oct 25 2018. My husband absolutely loved this ring. He wore it every day until the resin coating wore off. 5 months later it's down to the antler and slightly rough. He no longer wears it but wants another like it.
2.0,The earrings are nice but one earring's clasp came crooked and they are also hard to lock into place.
2.0,"While this suit was cute, there was a huge gap in the front that was very revealing when I bent over. I have already worn it, so I am stuck with it. I may have to have it taken in at the top in order to wear it again. The bottoms fit but were not very flattering."
2.0,I ordered my size but it was waaayyyy too small! Order up ladies!
2.0,I used these when I cook especially mixing food up with my hands. One day I did the dishes wondering why my hand were moist and their are tiny holes in them. Defeats the purpose of NOT being incontact with germs. I'm assuming the holes are to keep my hands from sweating. Having that said its sturdy and doesn't tear easily.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:8dad1cce45efa5cecad9adb90230ad2a]] I love the design but after only a few uses the latch wont click into place and I have no idea how to fix it😩
2.0,"Too small, even after consulting the sizing guide. Material was cheap and unflattering."
2.0,"I wore it to the gym, and did a hiit workout....the whole time it kept bunching up and was uncomfortable. I was expecting to be dripping once I took it off, and there was nothing like that going on. I’m a 38DD and the top half (shoulders)  was a little loose. I ordered a XLamd it fit perfect other than the straps."
2.0,"Too heavy, did not hang well on me kinked betwee beeds"
2.0,fell apart in wash
2.0,"The quality of the mask is good, but it's really small. Not small fitting, it goes on my big head not problem, but the whole effect is small, very underwhelming. Fit wise it would be too big for kids, it's definitely for adults.<br />The mesh on the front is too transparent, you can clearly see the wearers face, even if it's dark.<br />Overall i'm disappointed with the outcome."
2.0,"As usual with clothing purchased on Amazon, the product is smaller than advertised and fit and look not the same. It has become normal now that no clothing items purchased here will fit properly."
2.0,The brim is too large. It swallows me.
2.0,I didn’t have any trouble for fitting my face but it doesn’t seem that breathable and doesn’t seem very cooling either. I don’t feel any difference between this and other masks :/
2.0,After reading the positive reviews I thought I'd live rhese but the stone and setting was a bit dull.
2.0,One of the clasps won't stay shut.  It pops open and I don't know why.  To fix it I will have to go to Joann's or Michael's to buy a replacement clasps.  Might have to buy two since I don't know if the existing one will match what they sell in the stores.
2.0,"Had to return. Didn't fit right, it was too big and baggy and WAY to thin. I could see through it completely."
2.0,"Size chart was totally off, quality was terrible, material was cheap"
2.0,"The caps are too big to hold a mask firmly in place. The buttons sit fairly low, so my mask is too loose. If you have a lot of hair that might extend the cap backwards, maybe that would help I guess, but these won't work for me. Also, I saw the photo of the animal print and thought it couldn't possibly have the actual words, ""the sound made by a dog,"" but it absolutely does. It also has a lot of cats on it and the word ""meow,"" which I didn't see in the picture until I checked it after arrival. This makes the text make even less sense. It's funny, I guess, but since the caps are too big it doesn't really matter."
2.0,I didn't like the fabric. It reminded me of a nightgown.
2.0,I really liked the look of this set. I had to return it after wearing once. The chain tarnished. The pendant and ear rings stayed pretty and shiny
2.0,"Great quality, sized ridiculously small!"
2.0,"That split is not as low as it looks! It is impossible to wear this dress without exposing all your lady parts! My daughter is very petite but i still bought the largest one, yet it still showed EVERYTHING! The split is so high that you can't even pull that part down and it doesn't land on the thigh like in the picture, it's more towards the inner thigh which is why it reveals so much!"
2.0,Not kid friendly as it looks like its grabbing nipples on a woman.
2.0,Snaps were tight kept unsnapping. Did not like the plastic part it was like see through vinyl hot and stuffy not solid sturdy plastic . Like the ball cap offers good protection if you can handle the vinyl
2.0,It’s a nice jumper but it runs small!! And I didn’t like that I had to put the hooks on myself!!
2.0,"So I was a bit sad over this purchase for 2 reasons. First,  I ordered apricot and what arrived was more of a tan colour. Secondly the wallet that arrived had indentations in it. Not just the outside, but inside as well. Not sure if I just happened to get a defective product or whether it was used & returned. Either way, as inexpensive as it was i will not send it back. Went right into my garbage can."
2.0,I really really wanted to love  this shirt but it's made of a really thin polyester or some other man made material and the way it hangs at your breasts is odd. It doesn't drape well and the sleeves keep falling down. All in all not happy. Wish I could return but I missed the window. 💩
2.0,Super thick. Didn’t stay in place. My daughter loves them though. But not what i had expected
2.0,The watch band is very flimsy and the band doesn’t function well.
2.0,to small for me and I wear a 10 1/2
2.0,"It is very cheaply made. Cute style, but was a let down with how cheap the material felt and looked."
2.0,I should have read the reviews! I expected this to be raise like a license plate but it’s just printed on a thick card board. Can’t really say it’s worth the money as it looks worse in person than what is printed.
2.0,Orders an XL- ended up returning it because they were WAY to small! I own several pairs of pants from the same company and thats what I based this size on.
2.0,"It's cuter on the model. Also, I may have not read the fabric description and was expecting jersey material. It's more like spandex. It also isn't tie-dye, it's printed to appear tie-dye."
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress.  I had it hanging up for two weeks on my closet door trying to decide if I should keep it.  The dress fit, but it was odd.  I am very curvy (5'4 1/2&#34;, 36 D, smaller waist, larger hips, typically a size 14/16 in bottoms).  This is a true wrap dress.  The material is great- very soft, drapes and flows nicely, though being rayon I could see a possiblity of it shrinking.  This is definitely a hand wash and line dry dress.<br />In order for this dress to fit properly, I would've needed a larger chest (and I don't think 36D is that small!) and a smaller waist.  I'm thinking your dimensions might need to match those sung about in &#34;Baby Got Back&#34;...just kidding.  The waist was wrapped/tied as tight as I could get it and it was still too big in the chest.  It sagged where my chest didn't fill it out.  But what was weird is that even though it was wrapped as tight as I could get it, it was such a deep, wide V that my bra showed, and a lot of it showed.  So, the boobs were not filled in, but I couldn't wrap it tight enough to make the neckline look like the model in the photo.  So it is like the breast area was big, but the wrap part was too small.  I thought about keeping it and wearing a camisole slip underneath, but I knew I would've just been constantly adjusting it.<br />The length was to my ankles.  So if you are my height, and have a larger chest, and a waist smaller than 34&#34;, this might work for you!<br />Ended up returning this dress."
2.0,Poor quality. Felt like a maxipad for padding. Wont wear again.
2.0,Really disappointed in these. I had them for 3 months and then went to put them on and the nose hinge broke in half. I was careful with these and didn’t expect them to last a really long time but I figured longer than 3 months. However I’ll probably order another pair because they are so cheap and I seriously love these sunglasses.
2.0,I wish these bras were my size. I ordered my usual size and these do not fit at all. The band is tighter. My boobs are spilling out of the cups. They seem like great bras if they’d fit right and be sized right.
2.0,I ordered a large and it fits small and they are not lined. Very flimsy.
2.0,Band is lovely but I havent even worn it a month yet and the design has already started to come off.
2.0,Size runs so small I could not wear it.
2.0,"I bought these because the description said, &#34;The plugs also have little indenting so the o-ring can't come off too easily.&#34; None of them have indention's and the plugs are rather short so you are not able to turn them easily while they are in your ear."
2.0,The worse thing i ever bought online quality like toilet paper...
2.0,"Top is okay, thin fabric... And runs large. Need a strapless bra with it too"
2.0,They worked just fine for the first month of school. Then slowly bulbs started to go out. Now they won't light up at all. I guess it was good while it lasted. She was really happy for that time when her shoes would light up now she just wears them because she likes the color blue!
2.0,The dress was beautiful and I loved the material. The red color was vibrant and true to picture. I did return the dress because there was a 4-5 inch tear at the side seam and I don’t buy defective merchandise.
2.0,Don't buy. It's like wearing paper shoes
2.0,Says newborn but it's 0-3m and 0-6m
2.0,"Two of the  sets color has ""rubbed"" off before I even opened the plastic 😂"
2.0,"Pensaba que era para hombre, es muy pequeño, debería especificar; compre 2 relojes para regalar; tendré que darlo a unos niños"
2.0,"The listing shows an pack of 18 pairs of girls underwear in the assorted colors of pink, black and white for a cost of $25. I only received a 5 pack of orange, yellow and purple girls underwear (see picture) that costs less than half that price elsewhere."
2.0,"Not a fan of this one. I do like the sleeve cuffs, but the satin looks like cheap costume satin, and the ruffle around the neck looks odd. It would be better if the v neck was a bit lower and the shoulders weren’t gathered, but this just looks like a costume shirt. The green is also not as vibrant as the pictures, it’s more of a forest green."
2.0,"I bought this for my husband as we just moved to a warm climate state. Unfortunately, the XL size we got is very small!  My husband thinks it is just like a hospital gown. (Probably the inner tie and thin outer belt). It is soft and looks like quality workmanship, but very disappointing."
2.0,The Bracelets have already turned color and we gave it to our girls on Christmas.  It is January 11th.
2.0,too big and doesn't fit like in the pic
2.0,"small, poor light, poor chain quality, expensive"
2.0,Color is ok and shipment is very fast .problem bag size is small. No measurement is there.
2.0,"Beautiful, but it had too many gaps in the back."
2.0,They are way tighter then I would expect for maternity shorts.
2.0,"super cute, but they break super easy and kids have to change them at least 2 times during school"
2.0,"Very large on my face, won't recommend if you have a small face."
2.0,"Nice quality shorts, however sized small for me. My waist is 31 in and ordered an 8 (32 in waist) well apparently their waist measurement references a little lower than your waist, more like right at or right below belly button. So if you measure your waistline there you should get the correct size."
2.0,"They turned my ears green.  I loved the idea of these, but was super disappointed that they turned my ears green.  I understand they are cheap but shouldn't turn my ears colors."
2.0,Thicker than sperey laces. Difficult to thread through jokes and tie to lay flat.
2.0,Feels like you're wearing plastic
2.0,Not great. The glue leaks out making it hard to talk and it doesn't feel secure.
2.0,"I really thought the words &#34;Touch LED Watch&#34; was a peel off clear film on the watch, but its part of the watch.  Received it very timely.  but after two weeks LED is dim and dont keep correct time."
2.0,So thin you can actually see through it. Don't bother with this shirt. I'll probably use it as a rag to wash my car.
2.0,Too big for my kids 4 and 8. Maybe for preteens and teens but I will have to see it smaller so it stops falling down.
2.0,I returned these because the clasp would not stay closed and I was afraid I would loose my Fitbit..
2.0,"I was so excited for this lounge set when I ordered it. Unfortunately, it is unwearable because it is see through. It seems to fit me as it should, but maybe I need the next size up for it to not be see through? The shorts are the most see through since they are supposed to be form fitting and the shirt is loose. But, I would have to wear a different pair of shorts and a tank top, to be able to wear this in front of anyone else and unfortunately I do not live alone. The only reason I didn’t give it one star is because it is lightweight and pretty comfortable. I would truly enjoy it if I could."
2.0,Not what I expected but its okay
2.0,"I bought these socks for my wife as she enjoys watching Hallmark's Christmas movies.  By looking at the picture of the product I was under the assumption that they say, ""I'm watching Hallmark Christmas movies"" because that is what the picture shows.  When they arrived, that is not what they said.  One sock says, ""If you can read this"" just as shown in the picture, but the other sock just says, ""I'm watching Christmas movies.""  They are still a cute pair of socks, but I was dissapointment that, they weren't as the picture showed, and they were purchased specifically because I thought they would say ""Hallmark movies.""  I would ask the supplier to change their advertising photo so that more customers aren't caught buying something that isn't what is pictured."
2.0,"Thin, see through socks. Disappointing as an athletic sock. Runs small. Says Men's 10-13, but more like 7-9.  Seller response is non existent."
2.0,"I'm 5' 3"", 180lbs, 43 chest, 38 waist, 43 hips. I wear a 38G bra and an XL or 14/16 in dresses. I ordered an XL and it fit like a Large, so I'm sending it back. See pictures to see how it hit me. I considered adding some shorts-shapewear to make it more flattering, but the high side is SUPER high -- my buttcheek was just hanging out there since it's all fringe and the material stops where the fringe starts. My butt does pop out a little but not a bunch. I don't think this dress would be good for a pear-shaped person who carries their weight in their booty since I don't, and it's still not covering me up all the way.<br /><br />Please hit the ""HELPFUL"" button if this review helped you!"
2.0,Small for 4 series
2.0,"I do like the material and pattern. In the black areas the material is slightly see through but not back. However, these are NOT high waist pants unless you are looking to split your lady bits in half. I bought these specifically because they were high waisted and offered tummy control because I'm 3 month PP with my 2nd child and needed a bit of support. These are neither. I am 5'8"" and 240. I bought XXL and they were definitely not tight. No muffin at all but if you have any type of butt or tummy, these will not work for you nor will you be able to work out in then without your entire rear falling out. Very sad because they are lovely."
2.0,Way to small must be China sizes so beware!
2.0,"Well, after using this for a while, I've asked to have it returned to the vendor.  The latch keeps opening up and I've dropped my Gear Fit a couple of times unexpectedly because of it.  It's been a nuisance and I thought I was doing something wrong with it and decided to keep trying to make it work.  But, it keeps happening over and over, and I just don't want the hassle anymore of trying to latch and re-latch it.  The hook is very small and maybe just doesn't fit it tightly enough.  It comes apart with very little resistance; I've lost it at work a couple of times, and end up having to backtrack to figure out where I dropped it.  The band is lightweight and that was nice, but it's just not holding, and that is not nice.  Wouldn't recommend this item at all."
2.0,"Swim suit was cute in picture, but didn't like once I received it. Had to return. Will order from this seller again."
2.0,"this dress is huge, i ordered my regular size of medium and it fits like an XL. i look like i’m wearing a potato sack :( i’m tall too, and have a little curve, and it was just really long and baggy. i read all the reviews saying how flattering this dress is but maybe i should have ordered two sizes down to get that flattering affect..? but it was a good fabric lmao, and maybe if i get pregnant soon then i can wear it so i’ll save it as future maternity clothes 😭"
2.0,Medium fits like a large.  Way too big.
2.0,"It was so pretty and caught light beautifully,  at 1st. I used it for my faith and noticed a small gem in my ear. I took it out, almost half of the crystals are gone! It made me worry about them getting in my ear canal. I was so disappointed to have to remove it."
2.0,I ordered two pairs and have pullers in both pairs.
2.0,Runs small and cheaply made . I returned the shirt.
2.0,"Love the idea and style of these shoes but they run HUGE. My son is 12m and is average size, his foot is 4.5” long. I thought if I order him a 12-18m bootie he would have some room to grow even after wearing a thick winter sock, but these booties in the 12-18m size are 5.5” long! They look like clown shoes compared to his actual foot size. I ordered another style from this same brand (CeLaVi) and same seller (Scandinavian Kids) in the next size down (6-12m) thinking they must work, but the soles are 5.25” long in the 6-12m size! I’m not sure what’s going on here and now I have to pay return shipping for both separate sets of booties even though the sizing is so incredibly off. Quite disappointed as I was hoping I’d love these little booties, but since there is no size chart posted anywhere it’s a bit of a crap shoot trying to figure out what size you should get."
2.0,This dress is not good. it’s super see-through so it’s basically not usable as a dress. the only use I got out of it was using it as a cover-up over a swimsuit. the material is very clingy and not great quality. do not recommend getting
2.0,"The sunglasses looked cheap and poorly made, with flimsy plastic frames that felt like they would break easily. In the case of the white frame/brown lens combo, the white color looked more like a cheap, off-white plastic, and didn't have the bright, crisp look that I was expecting. Beyond the appearance, the sunglasses didn't fit well around the nose, and have odd proportions, which was uncomfortable and made them difficult to wear for extended periods."
2.0,"These were okay, not very sparkly at all. Also, the inside measures about 7mm. I have 3/4 princess cut studs and the jackets were way too big."
2.0,This necklace came In and it looked just like the picture except that several of the words were either missing or misspelled. You get what you pay for. The clover part was pretty tho. Update - we have had this necklace for years and while we had to pay a jeweler ten bucks to replace the diamonds it has not rusted or tarnished. Still looks brand new. We only kept the clover part.
2.0,"Looks Nice but made very cheap, broke as soon as I tried one of them on."
2.0,"this is not off one shoulder as pictured. it is a regular t-shirt. After reading reviews about the sizing, I decided to buy a large. Well, I should have stuck to my size. this is way too big for me"
2.0,"I was so excited to get this ring, but it came heavily tarneshed. I wouldn't order it again knowing that they sent me something that I expected to be in good condition for the price. Very upsetting!"
2.0,The waistband is Inelastic.  the pants don't hold up.
2.0,"The shoes have bungees on them, making the shoe too tight for the little humans foot. 🙁"
2.0,The stitching on the index finger came undone and they are practically falling apart. They are really heavy duty if they could stay together.
2.0,Fits okay; just not really good enough for work
2.0,The material is extremely cheap and feels like a Halloween costume.
2.0,"Beautiful, but broke the first time I put them on."
2.0,"I bought this for my buddy's birthday and I was embarrassed to see that the heels wore through in less than 3 months and he only wears socks inside. For $23 for one pair of socks, I would have expected them to last much longer."
2.0,Cool boots BUT size is way wrong .. I am normally a 9.5 and usually go down a size .. I chose to go with a 10 and it feels more like a 8.5 ... I have to choice but to bare the size and party is tomorrow ..
2.0,This boot is extremely hard to get on.  You will need a shoe horn.  It does not have a zipper and its difficult to get your foot in the hole.
2.0,"I had formerly bought a pair of this socks in size S/M, and I loved them. I am 5'3"" and wear a shoe size 6.5. They fit me perfectly and are very comfortable, good quality socks. I was so happy with them that I ordered a pair L/XL for  my husband. He is 6', shoe size12. The Chart says it fits 9-13. Big mistake. He couldn't even put them on, and almost fit me, just a little longer than mine. I think that size S/M should be just S and L/XL should be M, so they should make two more sizes for L and XL sized people."
2.0,They are very large; one size doesn't fit all
2.0,"Only now I see that its China made... Smoke tastes toxic due to exfoliating cheap plastic in the hose and machine oil in the pipes that give off fumes as you smoke. Everything is cheap, two stars because it functions. Will do my best to return this device.<br /><br />Smells like a rubber Halloween mask when you were a kid. Aweful. Go to a store. Get one from the middle east. Save your money."
2.0,"For the first month I had no issues. After that, it started to turn my skin green and itch. The metal then started to change color and look dirty no matter how many times I cleaned it. I only recommend if you plan on changing your dermal all the time like any other piece of jewelry that matches your outfit. Because it reminds me of costume jewelry."
2.0,This necklace was not as pictured. The charms are less vibrant and more like pastels. It is also definitely missing one of the charms which makes it look weird.  This item took about a month to receive and was sent certified mail so i kept missing delivery and had to go to the post office for pick up.  This item is meant to be a gift but now due to the colors and missing charm imnot even sure shell like it.
2.0,"I love, LOVE Gold Toe socks! Can't get enough of them, and wear nothing else to work where I'm on my feet 95% of my day. These socks last. However, this purchase was disappointing in that I received an opened pack with 1 pair missing. The shipping package was intact, the pair was missing when it was packed."
2.0,"As cute as they are, they only lasted me like a month. the metal in the middle kept bending and everytime i would put them on i would have to bend them back into place. it was really annoying and eventually the metal wore down and they snapped in half. really not worth it in my opinion."
2.0,"I returned this product. The color was completely wrong. I ordered the blue color and the actual color was significantly more green. The three sections appear to be made of different types of fabric and have very thick seams on the inside, making it overall fairly uncomfortable. It fit relatively well, although the sleeves were a bit short.  The fabric was a much heavier weight than it appears in the picture (more like the thickness of a classic hoodie). The strings were already starting to fray and there were little strings that seemed to be falling off (see pictures I have included).  I did not like this product.  The pictures were quite misleading and it did not stand up to my standards of quality."
2.0,"I suppose you get what you pay for. By the end of the first time I wore this, the grommets (round metal circles on belt) fell out and the fabric tore when fastened without them."
2.0,"The dress is beautiful but it was SWIMMING on me. I am 5'3' and 105 lbs, I purchased a small, it fit like a large. :( I gave it to a friend."
2.0,Pretty cheap and junky for the price. Thought it would be smaller and nicer for the price point but its about like a keychain.
2.0,I ordered these to pass out to my mom's chemo buddies fighting ovarian cancer they are beautiful but very cheaply made break when you put them on or take them off. Very sad.
2.0,"THE PRINT IS NICE, BUT THE QUALITY OF THE FABRIC IS RATHER POOR. MY SON WORE IT ONCE AND THE NECK STRETCHED OUT SO MUCH AFTER ONE WASH. I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY. DISAPPOINTED"
2.0,I had lasik surgery and I didn't see any improvement after wearing these glasses. Returned it asap
2.0,"Extremely small fit - I sent it back.  Take what the size chart measurements say is a size and then add one ore two more sizes to that - if it says you are a medium, you probably need an x-large even if your measurements agree with medium on the chart.  Cute though - just didn’t fit."
2.0,nice quality but they are much shorter than I anticipated - maybe 1 inch leg at most.
2.0,"The dress was adequately made, however, the satin material underneath the sequins and tulle was not the same color and in my opinion didn’t match well. Didn’t end up using it for my wedding."
2.0,"These straps definitely do not work for smaller wrists! *** Not recommended for smaller wrists &lt;6.25"" ***<br /><br />I don't know who is doing the math here because I can barely keep the watchband from sliding loose!  My wrists are exactly 6"" in diameter and the band barely tightens enough. Unfortunately, the metal buckle is also very uncomfortable for smaller wrists as well, as it sits right on the exterior ulna bone of the wrist...ouch!"
2.0,"Absolutely loved these, looked and felt great--until the plastic snapped after two months of regular use. Dollar store sunglasses are more durable. I'm actually super disappointed, because I loved these glasses so much while they were intact."
2.0,It's like wearing a burlap sac. Top is cute but the bottom is baggy and heavy.
2.0,"Don't buy this. The material is very cheap. I could hear seams ripping as I tried it on (a whole size larger than my usual, by the way). It doesn't look anything like the model. The skirt hangs on you and the waistband is too long and doesn't look nice. The top as you can see is not attractive in my opinion."
2.0,very pretty but too small
2.0,I ordered this swimsuit for my daughter for gym class. We got the complete wrong suit. We ordered the one piece with anchors on it and we got a polka dot bikini.
2.0,Not good quality material.  Did not like no label for laundry instructions or label telling what fabric is.
2.0,Poor quality construction had failure in watch band.
2.0,the ribbon is getting longer little by little as the stitching holding it in place loosens. It isn't something I can fix either given the placement of the ribbon. I still didn't give 1 star because I think it will still function without that feature.
2.0,10-12 fits like a 8-10!
2.0,"These stretched out the first use, and were never tight as compression wear should be. They work as great underwear. So that is what I use them for."
2.0,I AM A NURSE THIS CAP IS NICE BUT ITS FOR A SMALL HEADED PERSON.
2.0,Nice fit and print but this bamboo fabric was disappointingly thin. I don't feel it'll last many washes. I much prefer the texere bamboo pj fabric.
2.0,"Plastic stopper falls out easily.  Mask hole where stopper is, frays.  I had to stitch stopper in place on the two masks I purchased."
2.0,Love the skirt style but fits incredibly small would need much larger size to fit.
2.0,if it was not broken i would have loved it
2.0,Too dim for the Florida sun. Great look and fit otherwise.
2.0,Initially this seems like a space aged version of cat litter but then one will realize the clumping is irregular and urine settles on the bottom of the litter box in a hard crust.  It also sticks to my cat's feet which he tracks around the house more so than clay based litter media.
2.0,You definitely have to wear a shirt under this with long sleeve because it's a very itchy sweater. Runs very big also.
2.0,bought an XL but the shirt fits like a Medium. Also fabric is a bit thin
2.0,"Cute shirt, unfortunately, it's incredibly small!! I typically wear a large. I bought an extra large just to be safe. Still way too small."
2.0,These do not stay on
2.0,Looks better on the picture.
2.0,"I was not happy. It's a beautiful piece, but it design for a girls with no chest, not a women"
2.0,it was really pretty but it broke after one wear
2.0,Material is paper thin
2.0,Too difficult to get in.
2.0,"These appear well made and have a minimal seam.  Shortly after putting them on, they began stretching out of shape!  Not from pulling them, just wearing and walking!  Unfortunately they will NOT STAY UP.<br />This is pricey sock and greatly fails where needed."
2.0,too tight. tossed them
2.0,Material was not what I was expecting. Very small for a 2XL. Wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,I ordered a XXL but I received an XL (the package says L) 🤔 way too small. I can’t return it because I just now opened the package even though I received it 3 months ago. Some one needs to verify the size on the garments before sealing the package  🤦🏻‍♀️
2.0,Was not what was pictured was not AB Rhinestone was sequin
2.0,El producto no es de alta calidad
2.0,Didn't really look like the picture. Was baggy and loose in all the wrong places
2.0,"I ordered this pancho because it was the only one that had a picture that showed it fitting properly. When I got it  and put it on I was dismayed. It barely hangs off the shoulders on the side by about 2 inches on each side, not like it shows in the picture. The hole for the neck is not in the proper place. It is centered from end to end; that makes the front hang to almost your knees which is proper, but the back is only covers about half of your butt. I had bought one in Mexico back in 1972 and it fit perfect like the picture shows. I wore it so much I wore it out. The only thing I can say good about this poncho is that it is made out of good material. I DO NOT reccommend you buy this item, unless you are just going to use it for costume purposes."
2.0,LOOK VERY CHEAP
2.0,It is far too small - I wear a size 14 but these are more like a size 10.
2.0,"The fit is decent but what I didn't like about this dress is the color is a lot duller in person and that it shows every little stain or water mark. If you splash a tiny bit of water on it, it'll show easily and won't dry for a long time."
2.0,There is a metal stick on the top of the clip which I can't move the clip lower that the clip hang half way on my glasses.
2.0,They aren’t stretchy they’re just loose. Super cheap quality. I would not recommend.
2.0,I love the mesh but the face covering is very loose because there is no way to adjust it to to tighten it around the ears. They are too big for me :/
2.0,too pricy for such an old cleat.
2.0,"I liked the style the most. Also the price. Yes the material is &#34;cheap&#34; as some reviews say,  but that's what I expect from an inexpensive blouse. What I didn't like was the material. It is described as &#34;gauzy&#34; but this doesn't feel gauzy to me. Gauzy material breathes. This does not. But it is a pretty blouse."
2.0,i love the idea of these earrings with the planet/ solar system theme. However I am extremely disappointed in how impossible it is to screw the backs on . My son has them and he says the same thing- It's so hard to hold that small flat round disc and try to screw it on without dropping it a million times!!! The fronts come off the post too so you have to watch that you don't unscrew those as you are trying to put the back on...frustrating!  And regular earring backs don't fit so you can't use them instead.
2.0,"I was underwhelmed by this cardigan.  The one I got was irregular,  had hanging threads, and is super-light weight.  It is more like a cotton shirt, rather anything you'd use for warmth.  As other reviewers have said, it also is a lot shorter than the advertisement picture suggests. Also, the colors are much darker than the picture suggests.  They are a bit muddier and not as vibrant. Its too much trouble to send back, and I've worn it to work once or twice-- but it'll probably be something that I just use to cover with around the house."
2.0,I’m gonna say 2 stars because 3 of the 4 lasted more than a day.  One of em ripped at the left seam in front after one easy day of wear.  I wondered why I was so cold then looked down.<br /><br />Unacceptable on that one.  The others are fine and ones in the past are fine after a year.
2.0,"I read other's review warnings about the zippper, but thought I would give it a try. I love the coat, but now I can't return it and I can't wear it because of the broken zipper :/"
2.0,"Condensation accumulated under the crystal, After two weeks the crystal dislodged and it stopped working. It was very attractive and comfortable, The price was very reasonable. It was perfect for my  wrist. I should have returned it. I know it would have been replaced. Any item I have had a problem with, Amazon has replaced."
2.0,Don't like the type of stretch . Goes a long way past the buckle.
2.0,I love the colour of this dress. But it is way too small.  I cannot wear it. Will have to give it away. not true to size. I gave two stars for the colour
2.0,Husband said it wasn't like the original metal he through them both out.
2.0,It's such a cute idea but the shirt is bigger than I expected in the arm holes and neck opening and when I lean even the littlest bit forward the sides slip forward leaving me exposed. The tails aren't quite long enough to tie back for me either. Maybe I'll alter it a little. Maybe it'll sit in my closet til I clean house again.
2.0,Def small. Order a size up.
2.0,It wasn't as I expected and too big.
2.0,These do not look like the pics in this listing.
2.0,"Far smaller than indicated size. I gave my jacket to my son instead of returning it. I will be going up at least two sizes to get a more accurate fit. If that doesn’t work, I will have to return it."
2.0,"I LOVeD the style and the cut and material was wonderful BUT it was SO small. I bought the biggest size they offered and it didn’t fit. I’m an XL, so it happens but I was so sad cause it’s a really nice dress. I think the biggest size is like a US 10."
2.0,These are made for flat chested women. And the material is very soft but the thickness is a tad thicker than a bedsheet. Returned this one for another cowlneck dress. Those are good.
2.0,Girlfriend order.
2.0,This was a very pretty shirt but in the end it was just to small. I normally wear a medium in US size so I ordered a XL. Still way too small. Had to return it😢
2.0,"This product's touch screen claim is false. The gloves are useless for touch screen functionality. However, they are warm and comfortable.."
2.0,This dress fit so awkwardly.  It was billowy in all the wrong places- add in some horizontal stripes and it's a hot mess.<br />The fabric also felt very cheap.  Instant return.
2.0,"The ""clear"" lenses are much too tinted in low light setting. Buy better quality photochromatic lenses, you won't be sorry."
2.0,They feel kind of rough around my wrist.
2.0,The top was not what I expected. It is cheap fabric and poorly made. Save your money.
2.0,Doesn't compare to the Hathaway boxers that Costco used to carry at a great price.
2.0,Broke a part after a couple months.
2.0,Good coverage but arm fell off a couple of weeks. Had to keep fixing it.
2.0,Not of the quality nor detail as pictured!<br />Doesn't suck but no way anything special.
2.0,Spelling was wrong
2.0,"Button fell off after 2 wears, material is cheap"
2.0,"Nice dress , but I wish it’s was a little longer up to the knee . It’s like mid thigh and if I bend my butt will show lol ."
2.0,These scratch very easily and the nose piece broke off very quickly. The lenses were really nice though and I liked the design. I wish they would have actually put some money into the quality of their design.
2.0,"Much like the other reviewers complained here, the first pair I received had a large scratch on the top of the shoe.  I was able to secure an exchange for another pair, hoping for better luck.<br /><br />The second pair I received had a smaller scratch down the side of the shoe. Being less noticeable, I decided to keep them. This was a big mistake. After wearing the shoes multiple times, they began to make a leather crease ""squeak"" noise every time I took a step. This is obviously a ridiculous problem seeing as every time I took a step, the shoes made an audibly loud noise. It is probably too late for me to return them now that I've worn them a few times.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these shoes. Besides the terrible craftsmanship, they are comfortable and fit true to size -- hence when I gave 2 stars. Ultimately, you should not make the same mistake I did. For close to $200, these defects are absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />Buyer beware."
2.0,I wore the black pair only two times and they now have runs in them. Not very happy at all. These are what I like to call throw away cloths. Nothing is made to last anymore.
2.0,"Too heavy, look cheap"
2.0,This robe looks beautiful in the picture but the feathers are very cheap. Overall it is a very cheap looking and feeling robe. I would not recommend this to a friend.
2.0,Package containing the actual bracelet was opened and missing some
2.0,the flimsy frame broke less than a month of use
2.0,"2xl fit like a large, will need to size up"
2.0,"Loved this bathing suit, looked great and nice quality feel BUT I only got to wear it once. The color faded off the bathing suit at a pool party."
2.0,"Super small. I’m usually a large/medium and I bought an X-Large, and it was STILL TOO SMALL! Like crazy small. It was too short so my boobs were hanging out. And I’m just a 38B. Fabric is good quality and I love the design, but too small to wear anywhere"
2.0,Damaged on arrival. Cute case
2.0,I received this shirt today.  So cute but had a hole in it which I was able to sew. I am 5'6 133lbs. I usually wear a small to medium but ordered large based on reviews. Its tight. I can wear it but if I gain any weight it probably won't fit. I am a small frame woman that works out alot and a large is tight.  Keep that in mind when ordering this.
2.0,It’s a see through dress
2.0,The design is only on one side. The other side is plain black with some shadows of the coloring on the other side. It looks like it is a scarf shape cut right off a roll of fabric and shipped. The fringed edges are so short it looks more like the scarf is unraveling that it does fringe. The width and material are both thin. It is not something I would wear.
2.0,Too peachy a color and was too small
2.0,Came when expected. Very good size. Only draw back it the smell even months later.
2.0,I'm a little disappointed because it wasn't a bad ring but it was so small it's pretty much invisible the way it looked in the picture I was expecting it to be at least nickel sized or larger but It's not even as big as a dime so I'm returning it for something more noticeable
2.0,"Very small cant fit, the size chart is incorrect i need a medium"
2.0,"I loved it when it first arrived. I got it for my nine year old sister. Within a day though, both halves turned a greenish color. It was disappointing, especially for her."
2.0,Leather has a strong musty odor. Clasp is difficult to close with one hand.
2.0,"Purchased for hiking in the winter and seemed pretty decent on my first and only hike wearing them (2 miles RT). However, when I returned home, I noticed that the stitching had come undone in the crotch area as well as the bottom of one of the pant legs. I have already mailed back for a return so I can purchase something that does not fall apart after 1 hike and would not recommend this product or purchase again."
2.0,The structure of the hat is nowhere near the same as what I received.  Too wrinkled to wear and certainly wasn’t worth the price.
2.0,Thought I was getting a dress because that's how it is worn. However both sides have slits that go all the way up to almost my waist. Wouldn't recommend
2.0,"I saw these on Zulilly, but was much cheaper here on Amazon. I needed some much cooler PJ's for the summer months. I like these a lot, they are lightweight, soft and comfortable. The only downside is no support in the tops, so I can't wear these except to sleep in. And the strap adjustments tend to slip a bit. But otherwise I am very pleased.<br />Update 6/21/2018<br />These have not held up well at all. Tiny holes have developed in the fabric, and they don't seem destined to hold up for more than a month or two. I have already bought new summer sleepwear to replace these."
2.0,"I didn't even bother to try this dress on.  Right out of the package, I noticed that the fabric is scratchy and very cheap looking.  It looks like the type of material you'd find on a dress for children's dolls."
2.0,Looks great in the photo but the the sleeves look NOTHING like the photo. It was kind of lace look and the material was a cheep nylon....like parachute material. It looked like it was a 2X and I ordered a medium. I gave it to my Mom...she wouldn't even wear it. lol
2.0,"I ordered these for myself, however does not fit to size according to the size chart.  They were a great deal otherwise and ended up giving them away to a friend."
2.0,Not designed very well.  Catches on everything.
2.0,Too small and pockets in a weird place. I usually wear a small in these types of dresses but this was extra small and the pockets were too far up near my stomach.  Sending it back.
2.0,The description is wrong<br />Fleece IS NOT flannel<br />Returning
2.0,"its...okay. really cheap quality shirt. kind of thin, wouldnt really recommend. but i like the design on it, its really nice. i guess since its so thin i can wear it during the hotter months lol. also it took like two extra weeks to get here despite “shipping” way before. dont know what that was about."
2.0,"I ordered two skirts from the same company in the same size, but there was a 2 to 3 inch difference in the waistband of your skirt. The polkadot one fit beautifully, but the green one had a much stiffer elastic waistband cut into my waist."
2.0,Very cute dress but Not made for hips and booty. Those make it rise up in the back. Gonna return it.
2.0,The strap is very thick. Makes it uncomfortable to wear especially if you have small wrists. This also makes it hard to buckle on and off.  The buckle is big and bulky .
2.0,the jacket is long and sleeves are long.  Usually wear a small/Med in Nike and the Medium was much longer which is undecipherable in the pictures
2.0,Sizes are way bigger than a normal Medium! This is between a large-x large.
2.0,These were bought for my wife and initially she loved them but the backs were loose.  We thought we could get different backs to fix it. It turns out these earrings are just made with exceedingly low quality control standards and no backs will work. Don't waste your money
2.0,"I am only a 2xl,  So I thought it might be to small to I order two sizes up.  because of what this product it I knew I could always tighten the strings. but this product is to small at a 4xl.  What's with that?????  I think you need to resize your clothing line. I really liked the look of this product. So now I am very disappointed."
2.0,Did not come in larger sizes.Would have been nice garment if it wasn't too small .
2.0,"Really like the shoes for my daughter. But after only one day, the material on the toes are peeling away. Cheap"
2.0,"SOOOOOOOO SMALLLLL..... it doesn't fit like it does on the model, Its very straight, adds weight to your body/hips. not a fan"
2.0,"poor quality. The button holes are too small for the buttons and the threads on the buttons easily come loose and fall off. It did shrink in the was as to be expected. interestingly, it did not shrink uniformly. for example, one arm is now bigger than the other. Bottom line is, I wish it was a better quality shirt."
2.0,Not real leather all the way thru
2.0,Size was not what it was said to be. But all else was good. I made it work. Thanks for asking
2.0,"Sweater is not made, as shown in picture.  Seam is mid arm, not shoulder. Material is stiff"
2.0,Really pretty ring but small diamonds falling out
2.0,It is not a school or playground show as it cannot tolorate the use and will break.  If you like to use it occasionally and for non active ocasión then it’s ok
2.0,"It may be my eyes, but these made the driving worse than better, so I returned them immediately."
2.0,These were much bigger than advertised and one of them cake with a ball missing.
2.0,Cuts into the back way too much.
2.0,"The size were 6 to 11. I wear a size 11. These were sliding off my heel until I got p.... off. I bought other socks like these but were size 6 to 13, never had a problem with them. So if you have a size 9 or less, get them."
2.0,"Very See Through, have not worn it because of this. Also runs kind of small."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, but I was totally swimming in this. I'm 5'2&#34; 32b 115 pounds so I ordered Small. This fit like a Large or X-Large."
2.0,"Reviews were raving--must have been paid people. The measurements technically matched what was listed, but proportions WAY off. Looked like a 3-year-old trying on my mom's dress.  The fabric is a bit stiff and weird, but I will say, favorably, the color pattern is quite saturated and bright. I purchased for the style and the price, and high reviews, but it's worth the time to return. I'm sure it looks lovely on anyone of above average height."
2.0,It enhanced my stomach roles.  This is one Spanx item that I would pass on.
2.0,loved the material but too large
2.0,It not what I thought it would be. Too small
2.0,These were stylish but kept sliding down & wouldn't stay up on my face.
2.0,Cheap fabric and poorly made. Total disappointment; went straight to the local charity shop.
2.0,They look good but don't fit well. That's because they are narrow with a small lip. And I know it's not because I'm ready to move up a size because I just stretched to 3/4&#34;.
2.0,These earrings are much bigger than i thougt.  I like small clip on earrings and these just don't fit the bill.  They are however pretty so i will still wear them.  Now i am afraid to buy other clip on earrings.
2.0,Didn’t care for the color on me. Returned it.
2.0,Pants were way too short
2.0,"UPDATE:<br />I’ve worn this open top a couple more times since my review. But now It has completely fallen apart at the seams. It’s not wearable or fixable. One arm seam completely came apart and the fabric shredded so it cannot by resewn. I can tell the other arm is coming apart too. Not that it matters at this point. It looks like the manufacturer didn’t leave enough fabric along the edges to handle any five of the fabric. I’m bummed but you get what you pay for I guess.<br /><br />I waited to write this review because I wasn’t sure I wanted to keep this item. When I got it it was a litttle awkward. It’s not really a cardigan, it’s not really a blouse, the sleeves are a weird length. The material had an unexpected texture, etc. I thought I’d just try it out.... it’s surprisingly comfortable and whenever I wear it, I get tons of compliments about how great it looks and how pretty it is. I have the grey one. It’s great for an office environment where the temperature fluctuates. I’ve worn it 3 times so far. And it’s grown on me. I’ll keep it."
2.0,"2 stars for the color.  It's turquoise, the color didn't look right on me. A little large on my bust area. I guess I lost a lot of weight for my wedding.  But other than that,  it's cute. Will return."
2.0,"These glasses look cool, but I do not think they are big enough for men. I bought them for my husband and he loves them so much he won't let me return them, but honelty they do't fit his face."
2.0,"This is a nice dress, but it is to tight. need one size bigger"
2.0,"This dress is wide and roomy, and the material is a nice quality. But the seam at the chest for me is really high. It's a weird placement. on the photo it looks like the model's chest is within the upper part of the front, but on me it's above my chest and odd looking. On the model it looks like the neck part is a comfortable somewhat deep V, but on me the neck opening is quite small and the V does not dip down at all. And I have a thin neck so it's puzzling. So the whole top part of the dress looks nothing like the photo on a tall woman, the neck is a somewhat small tight opening and the chest seam is way too high.  Otherwise I would love it. Having more issues with YESNO's fit lately than I used to, so I probably have to be more careful picking styles. The sleeve lengths and chest seam placements are for extremely short but wide people in the last few things I purchased."
2.0,"Fabric wasn’t what I expected, no stretch at all. I normally read the reviews to determine which size to pick… maybe I took a shot in the dark with this one? Was way too small, cut was kinda weird. Returned. Looks great on the model, but not for me."
2.0,Runs off 2 to 3 sizes smaller. Material is super thin.
2.0,"these are cute for a water shoes maybe, not for every day wear. the emblem broke off right away when trying on."
2.0,"This is supposed to be a one size fits all swimsuit sarong/wrap. It isn't. Mine came marked as a Medium. And trust me, it was a medium or smaller. I am very disappointed. I was expecting a sheer sarong that I could wear. I also do not the fact that it has to be dry cleaned."
2.0,"Small is like large or medium. I ordered 2 and one of them came with one leg shorter than the other, the other one was ok. Material is fine. You can wear them up to your belly button or roll them down."
2.0,Lo coloqué y lo instalé bien pero no fue impermeable
2.0,This dress could be so cute if it wasn't for the lace detail on the dress. It isn't completely sewn on and it flapped out constantly. It stuck out and wouldn't lay flat. It really ruined what could have been a great dress.
2.0,"Huge around the forefoot, but the length is nearly correct so you can't just order a smaller size.  I'm not sure how it fits anyone."
2.0,"Received X3 vinyl gloves instead of Dr. GreenPanda.  I found that these tore more readily than the GreenPanda, which I had ordered previously. I like to keep disposable gloves in my car and these seem to be less stretchy at colder temperatures.  Might be coincidental, but Dr. Green Panda gloves in my car are easier to work with."
2.0,"If you want the bottom of these to go to about your shin then these are just right, if you want these to fit like the picture you're out of luck, unless you're very short. I'm 5'10' and they're too short for me, they're going back. I see now that there are actually three sizes, I should have gotten the long size."
2.0,"I purchased the dress in red. The style and cut of the dress is ok, the shiny material is garish, obnoxious and cheap. I am returning this dress in a exchange for a better quality item."
2.0,This item looks cheap and is not very sturdy the stones clouded up very quickly will not buy anymore.
2.0,I ORDERED A 2X BUT THE ARMS ARE AN EXTRA SMALL. THE SHIRT ITSELF IS PRETTY AND THAT IS WHY I GAVE 2 STARS. I AM DISAPPOINTED!
2.0,"disappointed, as the earrings are very pretty, even if small, but have no shine at all."
2.0,"Very cute short but sadly run extra small, I normally wear a 12/14 so after reading reviews about sizing I ordered an XL ( 16/18) as that was the biggest option, unfortunately they didn't even come close to buttoning, very disappointed as they were super cute and I was hoping to wear them on vacation, I sent them back same day I received them"
2.0,"We couldn't see the writing on the sides of the pants from the photo.  Nothing wrong with the fit but my young daughter did not want the words ""Breaking"" along the sides of her pants.  Seemed like a negative connotation to her."
2.0,"Was rather disappointed to be honest.  These capris were actually a lot longer on me than anticipated.  In addition, I took measurements before ordering and they were to tight in the waist.  On a good note, they did appear to be well made."
2.0,"the shirt was great until the first wash when a thread came undone. then after the second wash, another thread came undone. it leaves little lines in this type of shirt. after the 3rd wash and another thread coming undone, i gave up on the shirt and tossed it."
2.0,This products is misrepresented. The size of these underwear are as small as boys underwear rather than men sized. The materials are not what they have listed on the package. They state that its 90% nylon and 10% spandex but I beg to differ. I own another brand of underwear and they have the exact blend and amounts of fabric and this product is totally different than the other product. There is no way this is the same fabric and it has a totally different feel to it. I believe they need to revise what they are disclosing for materials and get the sizes correct or at least put a sizing chart to show the buyer exactly for what waist size it represents.
2.0,Only one of the 3 could be used the small one and the large one came with the gem out of the setting 😐 I was so excited but unfortunately can only use one of the 3
2.0,The pins were not included and the quality is horrible. Does not fit the Samsung Active 2 at all
2.0,To cheaply made bends as you walk the photo really shows it all I wish I had paid better attention to it to thin and flexible
2.0,Item insignia is great bit pins were broken when arrived
2.0,Nothing wrong with this item....it just didn't suit my need or fit like I had hoped it would.
2.0,"I should know better, I take a 2X and some things a 1X, I could not get my arm into the sleeve. Only wish the sizes were more uniform.<br />No more TAORE orders for me."
2.0,Cute. But super small. Like skinny. I couldn't even get it on my foot. And they don't even stretch enough to fit my skinny 5 year old thigh. Dumb!
2.0,A little too cheesy.
2.0,Size is way off. I wear a size 12 tennis shoe so I bought the 1112. They were so large I gave them to my son which is a size 13. They are still large on him.
2.0,The style would be nice but it’s awkwardly fit. Wouldn’t have it more stars but was shippped with a stain on the dress
2.0,Cute top.  Runs very small.
2.0,"The color is almost a rust instead of brown. It has a very orange undertone. I really was hoping for a brown. Even while understanding slight differences in dyes, this is drastically different from picture."
2.0,"The product itself would have been fine, nice even, IF it had come even close to fitting. Granted, I knew they were dreaming when they said it would fit 14-2x, but I thought since I'm in the middle with my 16-18, it would fit. Not even close, unless I'm a hoochy goochy girl!!"
2.0,This product was not what I expected. The item is to big for my wrist. The actual face of the watch is way to big.  There was no paperwork with the item as far as a warranty. Very disappointed . I am keeping it because it is just to much of a hassle to return it.
2.0,Not well made. They served as a costume piece but nothing fancy. If you are just trying to complete the Spider-Man look then it works.
2.0,"This mask is ok. First, the daisy print is the only one without animal paw prints all over it. The bandana is a thin piece of cotton with a seam around the edge. It works for how I use it (wrap around a pony tail and then into a bun to hide my hair when I don't have time to wash it).<br />The mask is just ok. It has adjusters on the ear straps, but it's only 2 layers of thin fabric. Thankfully it has a filter pocket, but even with a filter I think the remaining fabric is just too thin to be effective. It has a metal piece by the nose, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get my breath to stop coming out by my nose, so I know it's not really protecting me.  It'll work for cleaning the bathroom so I don't have to smell the cleaners as much. I won't wear this one outside. I have much better masks that were way cheaper"
2.0,I know these are compression socks and are made to be snug. I ran on the smaller side of the XL and I could not even get them on. The part that should lie around your ankle was cutting off the circulation to my foot.
2.0,Decent shirt. Just runs VERY VERY small in length and width.  Odd there are no tags whatsoever as if shirt was homemade.  .
2.0,"Fit is great, but color is distorted and not as pictured. What was supposed to be a black floral print skirt is actually a grey/blue floral print. Noticeably different, like two different styles sewn together."
2.0,So warm but ripped in a week
2.0,"super cute, way to small"
2.0,I didn't  like the color that arrived the color on the picture was brown with orange the color that arrived was gray and orange.. also it took 3 weeks to arrive
2.0,Product is small for a child.
2.0,This runs small. The buttons are barely sewn on and it came rolled up in a bag. The style is nice and it does look good once its unrolled and steamed a bit.
2.0,"Don't like these socks at all.<br />There is a design flaw in the toe area. Big, bulky seam. It's like two thick pairs of socks inside each other and then sewn together terribly across the toes.<br />The grips on the bottom would be a nice touch but you can feel them when you walk. The top wants to fold down.<br />They are thick, warm and soft inside.<br />Unfortunately I gave these as a gift to hubby and we didn't really look at them until our 30 days was up...."
2.0,Tiny and you butt hangs out the back!
2.0,These are a cute style and the elastic would have ensured they'd fit for a long time but they are full of loose threads. Trying to get them on you have to avoid pulling your baby's leg through unsecured loops of spare thread. I suspect they wont last long and because of all the hanging threads they look cheap.
2.0,"I specifically prefer the light bronze shade for  my ""shades""; accordingly, I ordered a pair of them as 1 set inevitably finds its way into the wash.  Regretfully I wish I hadn't ordered this particular make.  There is insufficient spring action for my liking.  They fit my rims but do not clasp on and come off easily.  There are better productions out there."
2.0,These guys didn't have legs on them like in the pic. And they have an arch in the bottom. So 😔 and they took forever to get here
2.0,Some of the cuts in the leather were not the same they were uneven and not sealed as for the leather started to strand<br />and the color from front to back is completely different but it says that in the post. I just think there should have been more time to make the bag for the price I paid  and we will see how it holds up. it will get used everyday as I am a carrier in NY city on a bike and this bag will be holding important papers for my clients. only been a week. ill be posting again on this item.
2.0,"I wanted to like this shirt, I really did.  But it just isn't actually flattering, and doesn't hang right."
2.0,"I'm usually a size 9 in winter boot and in sorel, so I ordered a 9 and a 9.5 (they didnt have a 10 or I wouldve ordered a full size up). I thought I'd really prove to myself that the other reviewers were wrong about being unable to get their foot in near the ankle....but they were all right and I am sorta left shocked to be honest!  I feel like Sorel made a total design error on this one.  I have narrow legs and super narrow feet. Usually I have a problem finding shoes and boots that fit my narrow foot. This time around, I couldnt even get my toes past the ankle to put the boot on in either sizes I ordered. Ordering up seemingly wouldn't matter because i cant imagine what size i'd need to be able to get my foot past the ankle. Maybe an 11? Who knows.  It's too bad because this boot is so beautiful!"
2.0,Pequeño pantalón enorme la blusa
2.0,send it back due placement of zipper
2.0,The ring is really small !! You can hardly read the words on it.
2.0,The contour of the mask fits right. However the material looks cheap and I am not sure what the heck they are talking about copper whatnots. The one thing i do like the most the mask has a nose piece and adjustable elastic ear loops. Its not worth $22. I like this company because I did purchase some items before but this time I think they miss the value and quality of these masks. I'm giving 2 stars for this masks because before I had this company's good customer service and I want to validate that.
2.0,Unfortunately had to send back! Didn’t care for the fit or the material . If you are tall these are not for you ..
2.0,"The padding is too hard & too wide to try to ride a bike on. So, as a tri-weekly bike rider, who has plenty of experience in using various padded bike shorts, l strongly  recommend a “more flexible pad & a slightly shorter length of the shorts. The plus is the very visible “reflection” stripes located on the shorts.<br />Lee"
2.0,"Looks great,  but.. the screws come loose constantly and has caused my watch to hit the ground a few times but luckily I always notice it. I love this band but have went back to the factory set. Hopefully the company will help me out"
2.0,"Not sure what size I actually ordered, but got 3 XL and 1 L. Large fits the best. Just had a breast augmentation and my breast will shrink. So for now they will fit... later they'll probably be too big.<br />UPDATE: All the zippers broke. Every last one ended up in the trash. Shouldn't have been sfm optimist when reading the reviews."
2.0,Fit really weird
2.0,Was not really a cotton/polyester blend as described. Tag said polyester/rayon/spandex. Material was not very soft/comfortable. Also did not seem as long as shown in the picture. Fit was a little awkward too- a bit tight in the sleeves. Returned.
2.0,THESE WERE TINY!!!
2.0,It was cute but I should've known that from the cheap price that it would be flimsy.
2.0,Earrings broke on first use- literally as I was putting them in my daughters ears for the first time.
2.0,The quality was as expected for the price. I ordered this in an XL and it fit very large from the top and sleeves yet comfortably from the waist down. Really weird sizing. Had to return because it came with holes on the sleeve like someone had cut it.
2.0,"It feels like a NON cotton material. Likely man made, like ski pants material. I'm really not so sure that it's breathable when I put my mouth to it and blow through it.. I find I can barely push air through."
2.0,The look of this is what was expected when I received it but I have a long torso and this didn't fit well at all.  I am really sad because the overall look is exactly what I wanted but way to tight in the length that gave a really bad fit overall.
2.0,The material felt like a foam instead of a fake leather. The strap disconnected from the sole of the shoe the 3rd time I wore them. It was disappointing.
2.0,That band seems very durable but it has an aluminum snap that bothered me if I work it too long or during a workout. I started to get some type of reaction to the metal and it would leave my skin with a slight rash.
2.0,The recipient of this shirt didn't like the material or the style of the shirt. The fit was tight because of the cuff sleeves.
2.0,"To get this to fit my bust, I ordered an XXL, but it was too baggy from there on down, plus it is a shiny clinging fabric, and I just didn't care for the look on me.  The back of the dress was really cute, but not enough to keep it for me."
2.0,"I loved the single clasp design, but it was shredding my wrist!  The edges were all SUPER sharp."
2.0,Material is cheap and flimsy - unlined. Top did not fit correctly - the top might be long enough to cover your bust if you are 5 feet tall and have little or no breast tissue. The elastic in the suit is flimsy and cheap. The whole suit was poorly made. I returned it. Top was too small and bottoms too big (ordered size small - I am 5'8&#34; and 120#)
2.0,"This went perfect with my yeezys, but I felt like a super hero for some reason so I sent it back. But the material is good and thick, perfect for the fall."
2.0,Thin material. See thru but fits as expected
2.0,"But came with a rip right on the side where the lace meets the seam. Bummer! I'm sending it back and reordering. Fingers crossed that the replacement is in better shape. The fit is perfect, and the color is amazing. Quality, ehhhh...."
2.0,"Bought this sweatshirt for my bro, he loved it but it’s way too small. It’s supposed to be a large but looks like a medium if that. I want to return it get a bigger size. Other than the size being an issue, the design is very nice! Looks just like the picture."
2.0,Gets tangled when you wear it and is almost impossible to untangle. Which sucks because it is cute.
2.0,"The sound quality was to be expected, the distance was really good, but any time i bent forward it crackled and dropped sound for a few seconds. It was not enjoyable."
2.0,Looks like a maternity dress and the sleeves are too puffy for me so I have not worn it. I also ordered a small and it’s on the big size.
2.0,I bought this for my wife on Christmas and the charm would not stay on the bracelet. She saw it fall off a couple of times but missed it the last time and it is now gone.
2.0,"Perfect fit, just pricey"
2.0,This scarf is much more brown than pictured. And the sewing around the edge is brown. It looks like black in the picture.
2.0,I am not a particularly large woman. My normal size is an X-large I read the reviews and I ordered a size up. I went 2x and these are still too small. just word to the wise: these are more than likely Asian or European sizes so I would say go up three sizes. They weren't so small as to be extremely uncomfortable but they were too small to wear and I could not get it off comfortably/easily when I tried it on.
2.0,Was too large.  Did not like the edging around the neck.  Made the top look cheaper.  Have other Jess N Jane that fit better and necklines are better.
2.0,☝️👎
2.0,The seams from the mesh being sewn in binds on my legs.  I ended up giving them away...wasn't going to hassle with returning them.
2.0,I Didn’t get the mask that was supposed to come with the slippers
2.0,Very very thin material and cheaply made.<br /><br />Needed repair right out of the plastic bag.<br /><br />My wife also said the size was smaller than she was accustom to.
2.0,After first washing and drying these shrunk to half their original size.
2.0,The touch screen function barely worked. Imprecise in warm temps and not working at all in cold. Used the gloves for 10 days and they started falling apart
2.0,The top stone fell off.
2.0,I really wish I could exchange for a smaller size but I missed the return window I like the dress it just ran bigger than expected I ordered a medium  ( 5'4 130lbs and would fit better in a small) normally I am a medium.
2.0,"Looked great.  Bought for boyfriend. However, after less than a week of wearing it, the gromets started falling out.  So the metal rings for the belt prongs are falling off, on holes he doesnt use.  So turned out to be a crappy belt  if its falling apart after 1 week...."
2.0,The shorts are very cute. But they run very small. I have to return them. I normally wear a medium. Couldn't zip or button them at all.
2.0,Fits well and looks great but quickly wore down. These googles initially worked perfectly but soon failed because the seal became sloppy and now always leaks.  I'm hoping that this nice design will be applied with better materials that will hold up better.  Will not purchase this item again until its seal material(s) are significantly improved.
2.0,wanted for granddaughter--wanted something soft and cozy these were stiff
2.0,"Way to small, but cute, only for baby"
2.0,Too big in chest area. Extra matrial and the cups are too small for the fit.
2.0,Boots looked already worn. Black spots and visible glue near stitching. Was so excited to get these. What a disappointment. Will return. Maybe I'll get a new pair.
2.0,"They roll up constantly, basically unwearable."
2.0,Bla
2.0,Mostly polyester. Light weight snags and pills up easily. Sleeves are a couple inches too short. Disappointed.
2.0,Not well made at all.
2.0,"Nice suit, but too short on me.  If you have a longer torso, I'd order up a size.<br /><br />I recommend this suit instead - [[ASIN:B01BEY332W Bawdy Women's Plus Size One Piece Swimdress Swimsuit Swimwear, Blue White, XXXL]]"
2.0,material is not soft as expected.
2.0,"Theses are very thin and you can see everything. The fit is really weird on me. The band fits my hips, but gapes in the back. They are extremely long and I have to roll them up."
2.0,Ordered this for my girl. Took a month and a half to show up and the quality was terrible.
2.0,"My son wears 5.5 big kids.  I ordered size 6.  It fits more like a 4.5-5.0.  His heel is hanging off the back end, but he refused to take them off, since he hasn't had flip flops all summer due to quarantine.  Extra star since obviously he felt it was comfy regardless.  Just disappointed they are so small"
2.0,Very see through! Not quality fabric. Ran way too big
2.0,"The build quality is poor for a renown company, after inspecting the watch I noticed small pieces of something white on the inside of the display glass towards the mechanism. I took the watch to a watchmaker and after opening the back and removing the debris the told me that they were pieces of sealant detached from the display glass. They could have easily fallen into the mechanism but fortunately the were stuck on the back of the sapphire glass.<br />Also the information in the specification is wrong the lug with or band with is not 22mm but 24mm."
2.0,"Earring are not the same as pictured, they are not textured like what is shown."
2.0,"Super cute ears, I love the pink with white dots. It's not the normal disney ear quality headband though. I thought I would like that it doesn't squeeze my head like the ones in the park does, but because it is loose the bow causes it to fall forward or backward. Hard to keep it on your head."
2.0,Cheap dress. Not true to size. Very thin material.
2.0,I got the black 3T-4T for my petite 3 year old daughter and it is very tight. The “mesh” part goes so low in the front and the back that you can see her nipples and butt crack or underwear. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because she can wear it at home for dress up but it’s a complete waste of money for dance class.
2.0,"The stem of the earrings are already black, lots of discoloration when still brand new. The ball of the earrings are sparkly for now, but I have not worn it yet."
2.0,Dress arrived with one of the tank seams ripped half way across.
2.0,"These work great with holding oil and giving a nice light scent throughout the day. However, I fell asleep with the blue one on last night, and woke up this morning with my arm completely stained from the blue dye 😳"
2.0,The color of the “white” is actually off white or cream.
2.0,The Velcro in the back of the hat pulled my hair. It was unpleasant.
2.0,"The champagne color does NOT have lace as pictured, really dissappointed . The fabric is extremely thin and cheap. Loose Strings and threads .Tried to return , but having issues with ups who say they have attempted to pick up items , but havnt once ."
2.0,"This dress runs at least two sizes too small and the bodice is very short.  The waistline is almost empire.  Oriental people are surely not proportioned the same way we are.  This dress material feel nice, but just way to small and it is going back."
2.0,"These are the same quality as you’d find in kids quarter machine! I’ve only had them for a week, and a couple are already broken (the stud fell off). I’m actually disappointed."
2.0,Broke within the month
2.0,"the bottons came out , the size was good, I like the model but without a bottons it didn't work"
2.0,Unfortunately the band did not hold up well. It broke and I had to tape it. I finally gave up when it ripped in another spot. I would not buy it again.
2.0,"UPDATE 2 months later....<br />I don't wear the ring often because it's soft and today it broke in half.<br />Although the ring is beautiful, it's extremely soft and bends very easily. With it having the pointed the ends it can get caught on things and because it bends so easily I'm afraid it'll break soon. I've been wearing it for about a week and I finally got annoyed and took it off. I don't see myself wearing it often."
2.0,After just a week in use the pull loop on the right boot snapped.
2.0,Material was ok. Cut just wasn’t flattering on me. Made me look square. Maybe better suited for taller women?
2.0,The band was very malleable and was quickly bent out of shape.  I had to cut it off my wrist.
2.0,"The metal alloy is extremely bendable and breakable. There is no way I could wear this item. It also has a very rough finish,<br />In which pieces snag my hair, and it gets caught!!!<br />I feel I do deserve my money back! When I placed my trust in all that product stated!"
2.0,Sent back. The material was a little itchy and it just wasn’t flattering. Maybe order a size down.
2.0,"I had ordered a beige hat for my daughter for Xmas and it was fine. My wife wanted one so I re-ordered the same hat. What I got was a khaki colored hat with frayed threads right in front. Too much hassle to return it, so we'll keep it."
2.0,"I bought it for my son who chose it based on the web site.  It turned out much much smaller than he expected.  It's more like the size you'd expect for an 8-10 year old kid, not an adult.  He ended up never using it and buying something else at a local store."
2.0,"Looks great on the model, but looks pretty cheap once on. Since it is one piece it is a bit hard to get on. You also have to have the right torso length for it to look good. The waist is a bit too short on me, I am 5'6&#34;. Needless to say, I bought this dress for work, and have never worn it out."
2.0,"the colors are nice and bright. I don't think the quality is very good, I don't expect it to last very long."
2.0,"Thought it was super cute when it first arrived, but then it broke and started getting picked on everything all within the 2 days of me wearing it. So not the best quality."
2.0,Didnt really like.  Thought it was a button down. You hv to be petite to wear this. Im a heavier busted person.
2.0,"Great looking watch.  I've seen them priced from $35-$160 on line.  Had mine for 18 months.  Back popped off and I could not get it back on.  Had to bring to jeweler and he changed battery, then put the back on with a special tool.  That was 8 months ago.  It's now losing 5 minute per day...running slow, shouldn't need new battery yet and i can't change it because of the back.  Might look nice but not a very reliable watch."
2.0,This is almost 2x bigger than I thought.
2.0,"It’s very small. I don’t know if she’ll like it or it will be noticeable when she wears it. Also the link to it doesn’t have much mobility to it. I don’t know how I feel about it, I’m just gonna hope she likes it. The size is the biggest downfall."
2.0,Not a good quality very small
2.0,Love these but since they married Amazon they're 15$ more than they were. : (
2.0,"The material is a poor quality, not sweatshirt material and the sleeves are short... slightly shorter than petite clothes. The fit through the body is fine otherwise."
2.0,The material and quality are good runs about a size and a half too small if your a bit larger. Ordered a 12 for my daughter who wears a 12 and she could barely zip and hook it. She weighs 160lbs and is about 5 6 1/2
2.0,The socks themselves fit well however I bought them for the whimsical aspect. That was all lost when I wore them with shoes. You can't see 90% of the ostrich as it's down in your shoe. I expected the entire picture to be visible on the sock. If you buy<br />It for the picture of the ostrich then know you won't be seeing hardly any of it.
2.0,"These shorts are very cheaply made. The material is extremely thin. They're cute, but definitely not something you could work out in. I put them on to go for a run, and six steps in, they started egregiously riding up my thighs. I had to go change. They're fine pajama shorts, but that's not what I bought them for."
2.0,Very light... like plastic like. Felt cheap. Gave to me youngest son.
2.0,"I bought one of these and it broke two weeks later. The loop that the pin goes through broke. I caught my watch on something and it just tore. I chalked that up to my mistake. I bought a replacement. It just tore in the same way after a very gentle tug. These bands are a waste of money. If it gets any resistance, it’ll break. I’ll buy a different product."
2.0,"I wanted more of a leotard material, that stayed deep black and smooth.  This is more of a blend that fades and shows wear.  I bought a smaller one for my other daughter and it is as expected, although there is no way to tell on here which is which."
2.0,"This ring looks better in the pictures. Poor workmanship,  I will not be wearing this ring."
2.0,"Very small. Came crumpled and wrinkled. Put in dryer to refresh and still wrinkled. Workmanship is also cheap. I returned.  Forgot to look, but had to be made in China. I also had to pay return shipping."
2.0,It’s a nice dress but I got a dress that is different on the bottom. It’s tight and the picture shows a loose bottom and it doesn’t look like the picture
2.0,When I purchased this sweater the description said it was a light weight soft cotton sweater.<br />What I got was a viscose nylon heavy sweater. There is nothing light about what I got.<br />That is why I gave it a 2 star. The product does not match the description.
2.0,This product was so close to being exactly what I need.  But it leaks uncontrollably
2.0,"For those interested in this band, please take note that this is not an authentic replacement nor anything like the original black and red band that shipped with the Basis Peak. The band itself is far to rigid when compared to the original, which makes it very unforgiving if worn tight. In complete honesty I will mention that it was not what I expected because I assumed that a &#34;Replacement&#34; band would be like its original, which in hind sight was grievous error on my part. For that reason I chose to give them 2 stars and not one like I wanted to when first receiving the band."
2.0,I was so excited for these socks. They’re cute but they’re too short. You can’t really see the capes on the back
2.0,"Cute dress, but runs small"
2.0,"I have loved these until just now, one just broke while I was taking it out. I'm gonna contact the seller now."
2.0,"Looks like there original color faded out, the black was purple or something like it was bleached it didn’t look as described. But I kept them because I can still wear it. It would be nice if I can have some that looked the way it should with more color."
2.0,"The photo's shows it should read , &#34;WANTED BELLATRIX LESTRANGE&#34; but instead it reads, &#34;ANTED ELLATRIX ESTRANGE&#34;.  Very disappointed."
2.0,The chain came broken when we opened the packet.
2.0,Runs super small and has no stretch
2.0,It is not a button down dicki so you have to pull it over your head with one button enclosure by the neck. It would not fit over my head so I gave it to my 4 yr old daughter.
2.0,Lace was way too long
2.0,Only lasted 3 months in a chlorine pool before deteriorating and not working.
2.0,The cut was off
2.0,"It was cheap so I thought what the heck, but it feels like wearing a plastic bag."
2.0,"I wanted to like this, it well made and the overall fit is good but the support band (what wraps around the torso) only has a thin elastic inside (at the bottom of it).<br />Because of this, the pressure is not distributed on the whole band making it too tight and uncomfortable. Sadly this is getting sent back."
2.0,"Very cute, but had a hole in the neck line that made it unwearable after one wash. The black and white one has great material, but runs EXTREMELY small. I suggest getting 2 sizes up from what you normally would."
2.0,I loved the concept and I knew finding a dress with this print and good quality would be a challenge. The material is like a very thin piece of spandex and straps felt as if they were going to tear at the seems with any extended wear.
2.0,"The size is terrible- ordered a large, received a non labeled sized sweater with no stretch that fits my eight year old aside from the sleeves."
2.0,"should've listened to the reviews and not purchased, material isn't the same as it appears in the photos, fit is different, and just a disapointment ):"
2.0,I wear a 7.5 and got an 8 since they didnt carry my size and was too big. The 7 would have been too small. Nice boot but sizes are not accommodating.
2.0,"Cute material, but a tent would be an accurate description since it's very long and large."
2.0,"Its adorable and its as cute in person as it appears online but Not sized right, definitely runs small. And 110% SEE THROUGH the moment it gets wet!!!"
2.0,Way too big than the normal size
2.0,"The shape and size of the turquoise and feathers is much bigger than it appears.  I will wear it but was disappointed in the size as I wanted a dainty, pretty ring."
2.0,not warm
2.0,"I returned this swimsuit. The material has a weird feel to it and not the usual swimsuit texture- it's slightly ribbed. The top fit weird since there's only 1 shoulder strap, the opposite side was too narrow and I was worried my boob would fall out from lack of strap. Not as high-waisted as I'd like either."
2.0,"Really thought this dress would be perfect. While it fit snug, it was still comfortable. However, it was pretty sheer even though it was a darker color and had a pattern/texture to it. Will be returning it..."
2.0,"This is a nice dress for a small person.  I bought the extra large and it fits every where but in the bust.  Also, it is has a very high waist and doesn't come near fitting at my waist line.  The waist is also much larger than the bust area.  So bottom line is it needs to be reduced and lengthend  in the waist and made larger in the bust.  The length is perfect.  I'm 5'3&#34; and it hits right at my ankles.  I really wish it fit.  The fabric is nice."
2.0,"I do not generally write reviews but was very dissapointed with this sweater. Looks very nice but it is wide at the shoulders and tight around the arms, runs small. Not worth the price, holes in the material once washed and the seams opened, an indication it is cheap workmanship."
2.0,All is can say is they slip so I donated them to Goodwill.  I would not recommend.
2.0,Didn't hold up very well.  Only lasted about 6 months before it started to crack and fray.
2.0,"It wasn’t what I expected - it looked a lot smaller in person, and the material felt cheap. There’s also a noticeable seam down the middle, that I didn’t like. Unfortunately it didn’t work out for me and I returned it, i was so excited to receive my new sunglasses and was so disappointed when I saw them."
2.0,"They look so cheap, but what did I expect for the price? :)"
2.0,Everything was too big but the fabric was soft
2.0,The fabric is too clingy and feels like what is normally used for a night gown. The size seems to run small. I have sent it back today.
2.0,"I received these as a birthday gift, and they are super cute, but.<br /><br />I put them on for the first time this morning, and within a couple of hours wearing them in my house, they've developed a hole!!<br /><br />Very disappointing, because I loved them."
2.0,I love the look of these shoes! Only thing is I purchased a size 1 but received a size 12.5. I purchased as a gift and going they will still fit.
2.0,These weren’t the best quality made. I bought them thinking they would fit nicely and some were sewn way to small and don’t fit and the stitching wasn’t the best. I ended up throwing 2 of them away didn’t fit at all. Only one fit fine.
2.0,"I know this is a very cheap item ,but the bracelet was missing.Otherwise it is OK"
2.0,I have many Homeyee dresses but this is by far the worst. It looks and feels very cheap along with looking nothing like the photo.
2.0,"Loved the fit, liked the colors, hated the texture on the bottom of my feet after a few hours."
2.0,Gives no support
2.0,I ordered the various colors and got all black. That is my only complaint.
2.0,Strings are already coming undone where you cannot tighten on wrist. I haven't even worn it yet!
2.0,"I ordered these because I am allergic to certain metals and liked that they were white gold so they would be silver (can't wear Sterling).  Unfortunately they are so soft and I had to return them to seller not just because they bent easily but because after wearing them only one time, the clasps were not stay closed behind the ear.  That just doesn't work no matter how you slice it - an earring must stay closed!!  The seller however, was very prompt in okaying my return and sent me a post-paid label so they are a fine seller."
2.0,if you are a medium buy a large or a extra large
2.0,Pearls look fake
2.0,"I love the design of this apron, BUT, it is tiny.<br />If you’re a size 4 and very narrow, this might be for you. If you’re more like me, take a pass. The bib portion is so small and short that the waist ties around my bust. Like I said, great design with natural fabric, but it doesn’t even start to fit. I will pass it on to the granddaughters."
2.0,I sized up one and it is still a bit too small.  Overall it looks better in the onlline pictures than it really is up close.
2.0,"Didn't fit me right, to tight in bust"
2.0,fran
2.0,"So very pretty, a good cause, but I wore them once and the clasp broke. They are still a pretty thing, I hang them from a lamp, but wish I could still wear them."
2.0,"Just an okay shirt. I ordered a large and it's snug at the chest -- if I move my arms at all you get that gap at the buttons -- but huge around the waist (and I'm not skinny). Just an awkward fit. The color was supposed to be ""wine red"" and it's really just a plain dark red, nothing special and not as pictured. Overall just blah."
2.0,"I ordered a size up after reading other reviews and it was still too small in the mid section. I’m pear shaped and if I would have ordered two sizes up  then the top would have been way too big. Also, the zipper was sticky. Returned the dress since it would have needed too many alterations for a cheaper dress."
2.0,"It looks as great in person as it does in the picture BUT second day I had it on on of the ends came unglued.  Because of that, I am giving it 2 stars."
2.0,Lo iva agarrar para mi oero estaban grande no cómo me gusta
2.0,"Very colorful and vibrant, however it made me break out and my skin felt like it was burning after wearing it for less then 5 minutes:("
2.0,"it came broken, and I had to fix it."
2.0,Pretty but came broken :(
2.0,Even too big for my husband
2.0,didn't like the color-returned it
2.0,The little ring to hold the belt broke after the third usage :(
2.0,"AFter only a few weeks of usage the strap broke, and the fringes pull way to easy"
2.0,Somewhat flimsy material. Kinda blah on top & boring. But super comfy. A little clingy in unwanted areas.
2.0,"I ordered the 1x in black, but after getting it I loved it but wanted it a bit more roomy the fabric felt amazing!<br />Decided to order a larger size and could only get green which was still beautiful... until I tried it on and was completely light faded and blotchy! So disappointed"
2.0,Very hard to tell on the screen the size of these.  It was too small to wrap the entire set of wires from earbuds all the way around it.
2.0,The pins from my husbands old watch do not fit in the new watch band. I am having difficulty returning this item due to the fact that it was shipped from India and has to go back to India. The shipping cost is almost as much as I paid for the product! I am hoping the seller will help me resolve this issue!
2.0,Says plugs plural but I got one...
2.0,"I ordered these earrings for my mother for Christmas and when they came I was really disappointed with the quality.  The cats faces had marks on them and they seemed poor quality for being ""sterling silver"".  My advice is to really watch what jewelry you buy online, the pictures are sometimes miss-leading."
2.0,The zipper is damage
2.0,"Hi, liked your product, I mean the Yorkie pendant, but I was surprised with the chain coz it was too short.. I was thinking it was a necklace.. the chain was all wrong in length, you cannot use it as a bracelet even coz the piece or pendant is too chunky..  what’s it supposed to be..??  a handbag Dangler...?? Too heavy, I think.."
2.0,"Unfortunately for me they did not help my breathing with my mask. Definitely had issues with sweating just as much as before I got these. They are lightweight, and easier to talk."
2.0,"Only giving it two stars because it looks like how it does in the picture but it is very very cheaply made. I bought one for school and put 2 70-page notebooks in it and the strap busted. I fixed it with a keyring and then the whole part where the leather strap is hooked too, ripped. Don't waste your money on a bag that may possibly be made out of dog skin, considering it is coming from China."
2.0,"They are not leaver back, they arrived with french hooks. Contacted seller, they didn't solve the problem for me. The leaver back was important. Otherwise they are beautiful and I'm so disappointed cause I really wanted them."
2.0,"Super cute, but really low quality. They started to shred and had several large holes after the first wash. Super delicate material."
2.0,Was hoping that it was stronger. Won’t hold a whistle.
2.0,Not as cute when worn.
2.0,It’s smaller than what I thought. Not enough card slots.
2.0,Too small. The inseam is not long enough for me. And the material is thin.
2.0,didnt like it and the material it poor.
2.0,"its a weird, puke green color that does not show in the photo, and it was very unflattering. It hugs every unflattering curve, but does not hug the ones that would make it more flattering. All in all, the only really good part was that it was soft and I liked the material - even if the color was horrendous"
2.0,Quality was good but runs small
2.0,There is nothing Natural or neutral about this hat. It is Yellow! The pillow that it is photographed on is natural.
2.0,"Muy pequeña la mascarilla, como para un niño de menos de15 años,  no me gusto..!!!"
2.0,They looked like something out of forever 21. Avery yellow tent and the frame was small like child glasses
2.0,The material is OK but the workmanship is very poor. The stitching was coming off fresh out of the box. Had to return
2.0,You advised that this bracelet was 8.2 inches as you can see its more like 7.8 .. its too small for my wrist.
2.0,"I had read some of the reviews for this product which described the difficulty of getting the key loops open to insert keys. I liked the design and compact size, though, so I ordered one. It arrived in just a few days and I was eager to try it, but on opening the case I discovered that the loop ends were so close together that even with diligent prying it was a near-impossible chore to get them apart. I would definitely NOT recommend this key folder. The price was too good to pass up, but &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;."
2.0,"Very pretty, but WAY too small for an adult to wear... it might work for my 5 year old"
2.0,"It’s pretty but after one wash it shrunk a little bit, but enough to make the ladies scape without effort. Order a size up even if you plan to hand wash it."
2.0,The pj top was nice & fit well. The bottoms were a flimsy material & didn't seem like they went with the set.  I returned the set for credit.
2.0,Very poorly made. Loose strings and elastic.
2.0,"I ordered them cause price was cheap & you get 2, truth be told, you get what you pay for.  At 1st I gave a great review, they came fast, we’re very pretty.  However after wearing it for couple of weeks, I sleep w my nose jewelry, only time I remove it, is when I bathe, that’s when I clean the jewelry too.  It turned my nose hole black! That’s never happened to me before! So, they’re definetly Not Stainless Steel.  If you want to wear them, I suggest just for the day, & then change back into 14k gold or stainless steel one, because who knows what they’re made of, not worth infection.  So though I was pleased at 1st.....I’m definetly NOT PLEASED ANY LONGER"
2.0,"I really like the material and the quality of it and the stitching seem good. But typically when I get compression shirts, they’re a little thicker and actually compress. These are just a really thin stretchy material- they’re not going to compress anything. So they’re basically like a regular tank top. Plus they run extra small- I would normally be comfortably in a large, but ordered a 2xl and they feel more like a small-medium."
2.0,"I ordered size up,  and it was very tight. My breasts were squished like crazy!  It is a pretty print. Sheer and see through! Reminded me more  of a beach cover up. Maybe if i lose some weight i could wear it,  but at this point my breasts are just to big. I wear a 38d,  weigh 175, and ordered the 2xl."
2.0,These have a super tight fit on the top. My thigh is very compressed in them and they look small on me. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,Ordered an XL should of ordered a size up..but overall very thin and light tank but wasn’t a good fit
2.0,Stone is almost falling off after less than a few weeks of ownership.
2.0,"This shirt has some strange seams, and honestly,  it's the first thing that comes to mind.  When wearing the shirt I noticed that the wide lower hip seam is much tighter than the fit of the rest of the shirt. The cuff on the sleeve is about 6 inches long and it makes another very tight seam right in the middle of my forearm.  This cuff makes it so I am unable to pull up my sleeves and the sleeve is too tight to roll up at all.  Another strange seam is that of the neckline. When I first put the shirt on I thought &#34;I must have it on backwards&#34;. Nope, the neckline is just AWFUL. It slides forward and  puts some pretty serious pressie on the throat,  exposing all the way down to the bottom of my shoulder blades in back.  The photo showed it to be a very flattering style but it was a lie.  I even asked my friend to try the shirt on,  she is a size small and my medium shirt fit her nicely,  but the neckline and sleeves did the same to her. On my friend,  the waist seem (waist belt, as she called it) was not too tight but laid far below her hips.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't recommend this product.  I recieved it on a discount promotion and wish I hadn't spent $$ on it in the first place."
2.0,It was not like the picture...
2.0,There are lots of raw edges.  Not well made.  Not at all flattering.  It was more wide than expected and not as long.  I thought this would be cute.
2.0,"Springs stretched leaving me unsure I could trust the product. I threw these away and purchases another, similarly priced item with fixed loops that has worked very well."
2.0,Way too small compared to how it looks online. Sent it back as I was hoping for a heart that people could actually see.
2.0,but they dont stay on lol they roll down under your feet
2.0,Nice size and color but the exterior site zipper broke after 2 weeks of use.
2.0,"Cute but not for sensitive skin.  I've had my  piercing for 16 years.  The first week I wore it everything was fine, but then it became infected overnight.  I can't wear it at all."
2.0,Cute but cheap fabric. I wore this once time and. Is it is in the donate pile. It was all pilly after one wear. Wish I could return this!
2.0,"The skirt itself looks nice, however I haven't even worn it yet and it already has holes at the seams."
2.0,"Set seemed to be of good quality when we received  it, but the underwear shrunk significantly after washing.  Did not seem to help keep my son warm."
2.0,"Good looking belt, but I had the darndest time unlocking the belt to loosen or remove.  Seemed easy when not on but when wearing it, it was extremely difficult to loosen or remove."
2.0,Cheap and shapeless.
2.0,"Very cheaply made, took over a month to get here. You get what you pay for. Lesson learned!"
2.0,"They fit fine however, they do show. Not what I wanted or expected."
2.0,Was not made well
2.0,DISAPPOINTED  DIFFICULT TO SEE HAND AT NIGHT OR IN A DARK PLACE = THE BLACK BACKGROUND DOES NOT HELP ..  one to ten a  5
2.0,"This dress is cute, nice fabric but sewn terribly.  They only put the top fringe across the front, it ends at the shoulders.  The lining across the back is too small and is sewn incorrectly, there's no top stitching to hold it in place and it flips out and hangs outside the dress.  The sleeves are too tight under the arms and the cuffs are sews tightly, almost giving the dress puffed sleeves."
2.0,cheaply made. I love the look but they break really easy
2.0,"I've just never had any luck with these.........I see people wearing 'em all the time and swear by 'em.........I tried wearing them alone, over hats/headbands; under hats/headbands.............love the colors...........just don't work for my head.......friends loved 'em!"
2.0,They were childlike. Very pretty but small.
2.0,The price is far more than the jacket material worth.
2.0,Does not look like picture.  The color of the orange is a bright construction cone orange or Orange is the new black orange.  Not flattering. Also the print is only on one side. ( a sign of poor quality). When you look on the inside of the shirt it doesn’t look like the print.
2.0,"I'm 5'7 245 pounds, and got 16/18, my regular size, but it was to small and tight, theirs no stretch. they run small. I like style, but sizing  chart needs work."
2.0,Material is not very good. It looks like the kind that shows white marks when you iron them. The photo shows that it is way more volumous than it actually is.
2.0,I would certainly go a size or two up on this top.  It runs small.
2.0,I ordered a large and it looks like a small.
2.0,Been a little over one month and not even daily wear. The tie has started to fall apart and unravel
2.0,Didn't fit the way it looks in the item picture. It was too large making it look frumpy
2.0,"At first I was so excited, because this watch was exactaly What I was looking for. It is stylish with a minimalist look, a large face to make it easier to read, and none of the distracting design elements.<br /><br />However, I’ve had more trouble reading this watch than I ever have in my life. I am somebody that relies on my watch To tell time, not my cell phone.<br /><br />For some reason the hour hand always seemed a little bit farther along than any other clock/watch that I have used. I was constantly double guessing the time and thinking I was late by an hour. I also was having trouble taking it on and off and putting it on correctly do to the dial Knob being on the opposite side of what I’m used to (left wrist, with the knob on the right side) This doesn’t seem like a big deal but it is easier to change the time when it is in this orientation.<br /><br />End of story, I will be getting an a new watch I’m cutting my losses with this one"
2.0,Product is made from cheap materials. Slides off of hair after couple of minutes. Thin and too narrow. Waste of money
2.0,Perfect idea for a pant and exactly what I’ve been looking for but the material is thin and unflattering. With a dark material it may not be as bad but it shows every lump and bump on your skin. I read a couple other reviews that said the same thing and I should’ve listened lol.
2.0,I'm 5'2 and less than 100lbs. I ordered a small and it was way too big. The dress is pretty cute though.
2.0,broke on first wear.
2.0,"Product does run small as reviews suggest. I ordered a size up (I 6/8) for my 4.5 year old. She is about 35 lbs and almost 4ft tall. The leotard has barely any room for her to grow, so I am not sure it will last a year. Also, when I opened the package, there was dirt on the front of the leotard that I have to try and get off. It is very soft and my daughter liked the feel of it. That's the only reason I am not shipping it back. Though if I am paying g that much for a leotard it shouldn't come with a stain on it."
2.0,Would not purchase again. Does not stay in place
2.0,I thought I would try this gun holster out and it works but my extra mag pouch strap is too thin and mag strap always comes off. Not something you want if you bend over to get something. Make it wider and larger and this will be a awesome holster
2.0,"Bag seems sturdy, thick material, smaller than expected, but my biggest issue was that the shoulder straps were significantly different lengths, so if you don't like to use the long strap, the bag would be almost unusable."
2.0,Not a good fit and runs small.  Material is not flattering to the cut.  Cut of waist is off.
2.0,They do not keep feet as warm as hoped.
2.0,Riggt lens doesn't snap into place in down position.
2.0,You can barely see the writing/graphics which is a huge reason I bought this bag. I would have bought something different had I known.
2.0,"Product came rolled up and squashed in a bag. Was so bent, I couldn't fathom wearing it, returned it."
2.0,I love the patterns - just wish they fit my FitBit
2.0,I don't believe it was made for an adult Caucasian woman. It does not fit or look like the pictured item.
2.0,The image on the tee shirt is not as vibrant as shown in the picture. It actually looks like it’s been washed several times.  I would not repurchase again.
2.0,the fit wasn't right for me unfortunately
2.0,After one wash the edging around the neckline wrinkles so badly it will not iron out.
2.0,"After only wearing twice, the right strap broke."
2.0,Not flattering. Blue was lighter than expected. I'm usually between a small and medium. The small was big.  Light see through material.
2.0,"These might have been okay if the legs were longer. I'm 5'5"" and could not pull these up to where they should be. The color was a bit disappointing, as I expected a brighter green."
2.0,Very cheap made the material is sheer even the pants
2.0,The glue popped on day one and began peeling. Beautiful case tho.
2.0,Was NOT a perfect fit as advertised and the colors are definitely NOT as vibrant as seen in the pics. The edges protrude and tend to get caught or snag on my clothing. Only wearing b/c I didn’t want the hassle with returning and I needed a new band. Looking for another one right now.
2.0,Does not like to stay perched on the top of my ear. Would be better with a better way to hook on.
2.0,Did not like the fit and material.
2.0,Accent zipper broke only few weeks after I bought them
2.0,"not really what i expected, the material is kind of cheap and bulky. also the sleeves are tight around the shoulder area."
2.0,"Love the bracelet, but it turnt my are black shortly after wearing it!"
2.0,"The print is nice but the size makes them only useful for dessert, the small plates wont fit more than a large cookie, very disappointed, I will keep them because for me it is not worth the hassle to return item, I will use the napkins and let the kids play with the plates."
2.0,The image shows some tapering at the waist....there is none.
2.0,Sooooo very tiny & that slit really goes up high. I could not wear it.
2.0,"I liked the length and the material, however, it does not fit comfortably at all.<br />I am not quite sure whose size chart they are using. Online it says the XXL is similar to 18.<br />IT is Not, the fit is closer to a large .. I am disappointed, I will try to return."
2.0,Cheap feeling fabric
2.0,"I wanted to like this as it was very lightweight, but even the small was like a tent. I could also tell from the proportions that going down a size would not help.<br />Very boxy with huge sleeves."
2.0,"Wanted as shown, plain canvas colored bags. Got Liberace style gold shiny bags. Yuck."
2.0,The  size (wide)  of the sleeves was too short  for the size that I chosed. (XL).
2.0,"The shirt is very soft, but it is also see through.  I can not wear it.  Also, its design doesn't drape as shown here when worn.  It is basically a thin t-shirt with very wide sleeves and a slight narrowing towards the bottom.  I am disappointed."
2.0,Skirt is perfect large n the top came as a XS or something ... have to return the outfit
2.0,"Design is beautiful, but they came with their tassles all bent and ugly. Had to dip it in water and hang it to dry for couple days before use."
2.0,I am so sorry that these heel pads didn't work out for me.  The purpose of my purchase was to create a more narrow heel to the back of my shoe.  This didn't happen. The portion of the pad that rests on the foot bed of my shoe gave additional height and caused my heels to slip out of my shoes instead.
2.0,"The image is ridiculously stretched, so it's super blurry. But, from far away it looks fine I guess. Not like pictured on Amazon at all. Disappointed!"
2.0,"I like the fit of these shorts, but I’ve had 3 pairs now and the zippers are real garbage, difficult to zip and down and the zipper splits."
2.0,"This is my 3rd pair. I had to return the second pair due to poor quality and broken ear piece.<br />The third pair was too big for the eyeglass container and the nose piece fell off<br />on the first day of use. I was able to repair the new nose piece with superglue, but<br />I will nor order this eyewear again."
2.0,did not stay on the heel.
2.0,"Need actual sizes, not just a one size fits most. I am 5'4, 140 muscular build and I was absolutely swimming in this."
2.0,areas of dress unstitched
2.0,"Bought a size Large 14-16 and measured up to my size M 10-12, it was exactly the same. No longer, no wider. Sleeves the same length. Disappointed. Love the jacket if sizing was correct"
2.0,Worn once a week for about 7 months buttons on the pockets fall off easily and the zipper started tearing out today never had a zipper tear out on any pants ever
2.0,Returning g item... my wife is not happy with the length
2.0,"I ordered this custom shirt for my husband as a workout shirt. It was a lot of trouble to put in all his information etc, and then it took over a month to come. Once it arrived, we were underwhelmed. Yes, it's a t-shirt.... That's about it. It's nothing special. We got it on prime days for $5, and it's probably worth about that or less."
2.0,This item is NOT very elegant looking. It looks cheap. And I can almost see the Black &#34;Diamond&#34;.<br /><br />The chain is too flimsy and WAY TOO SHORT.
2.0,Does not work for big chests
2.0,"The glasses look great, but they are NOT polarized."
2.0,Going to have to return one of the shoes won't charge but I am going to reorder cause she really loves them just one bad shoe
2.0,I'm usually a s/m. Bought a Medium & the tops too small & fit weird. Returned it.
2.0,The white is so see-through it isn't funny. Just to save some girls who want the white.
2.0,"This scarf is a scarf for children.  It's tiny and thin, and I probably will re-gift it.  It's sad because it's such a cute fabric."
2.0,Bought it and had to return it. Its very warm and we'll built structure wise but my fingers felt squished.
2.0,The pins are too short for Versa lite. I had to use different pins to make it fit.
2.0,A bit goddy for me. Definitely know it's on you....lol
2.0,"To me, these socks have the feel of all synthetic content even though this product is described as being constructed of 70% cotton.  At Christmas, I received socks from Amazon for the same price described as having 70 % cotton and they feel to me like 70 % cotton and are thicker as well even though they are a dress weight sock by Alpine Swiss."
2.0,So sad. This dress was not the floral print as pictured. It is a silky material and short for the style. It’s more in the reds than coral pictured. Honestly not even the same floral pattern. I am sending it back.
2.0,Not high waisted as advertised.
2.0,"My wife loved this purse. After a month or so of use the zippers began breaking off. When I say a month or so of use, I mean maybe wearing the purse once or twice per week for a month (a total of 8 times). She doesn't over use zippers by any means, they just started falling off. There may be 1 or 2 functional zippers left on the purse. She has now stopped wearing the purse because of the zipper issue."
2.0,I thought it was thicker. It feels cheap.
2.0,I purchased item in February it is now May and the straps popped.
2.0,"Embroidery dots bad for pitting edema.<br /><br />They actually fit for a wide calf which is rare and a plus. These socks have thickly embroidered dots, so when I removed them my legs were indented with dots. They did provide some compression because my legs/ankles were not as swollen as they may have otherwise have been...but to have your legs covered with dozens of indentions was very unnerving and I was concerned this would happen when I received them.<br /><br />I am going to keep them for when I'm not already swollen; to have as a preventative. But this design is ridiculous. The threads did not need to be so thick or the dots could have been sewn into the top layer only. I'll now know not to order more like this."
2.0,"I wanted to really like these but the give no curve, completely flat, look kinda weird on."
2.0,"After seeing the price and assuming you &#34;get what you pay for&#34; over that of the Athletic version that costs a fraction of this one that I have used for years now...all I can say is that I wore these new ones and they are not comfortable at all. Maybe these are for people who just have arch issues? Who knows, but if you are looking for max comfort I would have to highly recommend sticking with the much cheaper athletic version from sofsole as it is the best and most comfortable I can find. It's a shame how much I paid for these knowing I never want to wear them again."
2.0,Seller was fine.
2.0,Looked much bigger in photo
2.0,"Did not fit as expected. Weill be returning it. Color was nice, just didn't fit."
2.0,Not at all what I expected.  Clingy and unflattering.
2.0,The boot did not last a month. The soil has come apart. Poor design.
2.0,The ball park looks dull and grayish. Not shiny and silvery. Pass on this one. I’m sure there’s better choices out there
2.0,"I am 5 ft but curvy. Hips 50 inches. I got the extra large, but it's clearly only meant for taller, not curvier. I put it on so carefully and slowly and it ripped right in the crotch. There wasn't a lot of stretch in the thighs so I had to maneuver a lot. It's sturdier than most but for my body, it will probably only last 1 or 2 performances.<br /><br />The color though is beautiful. I love the foot pad at the bottom."
2.0,Cheaply made. Latch broke the first time putting it on.
2.0,"Shoes are well made, but lights go out in a day.  Ordered a second pair and same issue."
2.0,"The watch I received did NOT have a visible digital display as shown in the product description.  It was there, you just couldn't see it. I've attached photos to show both with the LIGHT button pushed and not pushed.  It appears that the watch is defective or was shipped with a dead battery or maybe just poor design. I am returning it."
2.0,FELL APART
2.0,"I was so excited for these because my area is getting abnormally cold weather.  But when I opened the package I almost cried - I wear a size 8/10 jeans, and there's no way these would fit me.  I saw they were stretchy so decided to try them anyway - I couldn't get them further than my knees!  I gave them to my 13 yr old and even she said they were tight."
2.0,The material was not as expected. Too thin. Very cheap material. Overpriced.. the colors are also not the same as shown on the picture.
2.0,Longer than it looked in the pic.
2.0,I bought these in X-large for my wife. She is about 5'7&#34; and around 150lbs. These were not close to fitting her.
2.0,Too Big to fit in any pocket - gave it to my dad - TOO big for him - even in old man pants
2.0,waaaaay too small. I was only able to wear it once and even then suffered the whole night bc it was so tight.
2.0,"Bought for my daughter's shoes (size 5 toddler), and they are WAY too big for them. I tried doubling them up, but then they were so tight I couldn't get them on. Would be good for adult shoes, but not for any child shoes.<br /><br />All elastic is the same length, so would cause some issues in adult shoes with the toe being loose and the ankle being too tight."
2.0,Always do your homework. This shirt is 85% cotton and only 15% silk. Save your money and buy Hanes shirts.  Feels the same and costs cheaper.
2.0,"I wear a size small, but this size small it a bit snug on me."
2.0,Not at all comfortable. Super disappointed
2.0,The material was not as I expected. It was too flimsy.
2.0,The face part is way to small!
2.0,Strap is useless and watch keeps falling from my hand.
2.0,"This bracelet has one of my favorite Bible verse, that was my reason for buying it. I will not recommend that you purchase it. Style is beautiful but it's pitted and look old as if it was worn,"
2.0,"Very pretty! I bought a size 8, and it runs very small...fit like a size 7."
2.0,"This dress was way too small. I'm a size 12, and ordered an XL just to be safe. It was about 3 inches away from closing in the back. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Not really a compression shirt. More of a tight shirt made with weak material. I returned this item. They could work well as a loose fit shirt, but I would recommend ordering 2 sizes up if that's what you're going for."
2.0,Nice but too small. Sizing not accurate.
2.0,"I usually take an 8 1/2, but they were way too small, so I ordered a full size larger which fit in the length, but were extremely wide for my feet.  If you have wide feet, these would work.  I also need a more cushioned sole and a better arch support."
2.0,"I did not like the material,  and thought it should’ve been lined.  A little too clingy."
2.0,The top appeared unfinished. There were a lot of loose threads dangling from the sleeves like the seams were unfinished.
2.0,The coat fitted very tight at the bottom. Too much room on the arms.
2.0,"I expected these socks to be great because their other socks are. But within an hour they were slipping off my heel. I bought the recommended size based on my shoe size, and it is the same size as their other socks so that was not th problem."
2.0,4xl fit like a 2xl. Gave to someone smaller.
2.0,"It was pretty small for my butt! Not an adult size. Also, the description was inaccurate."
2.0,This is not as shown. It’s a crop top style loose top. I even ordered a size up and it didn’t even reach my waist band.
2.0,"Item is beautiful, but one of the rings broke before wearing."
2.0,One pair had a small hole in it.
2.0,There was a hole in the side seam
2.0,Very awkward fitting. The pants are way too high waist ( im 5ft)  the quality is not spandex the bra is super wide.<br /><br />No bueno. I returned ASAP
2.0,Too thin. Hardly noticeable and looks like it will break easily.
2.0,"Shirt is cute and I could of worked with it, but the fabric doesn't feel nice on my skin. It just wasn't for me. Large with 38"" bust, 33"" waist, 41"" hip."
2.0,"The top of this dress is amazing! I ended up returning it because the skirt is very sheer. I read the previous reviews that said it was sheer, but they had ordered the lighter colored dresses. I was hopeful this one would be ok with the darker skirt. It wasn’t. I will be buying the bralette that is the same as the top of this dress because I loved it so much! I did buy a medium, and I typically wear a large: the medium fit perfectly!"
2.0,"Wristband itself:<br />Holds the fitbit one very well. Colored as pictured. Strap adjusts to various sizes.<br /><br />Went to return, after shipping I would owe money. Guess I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />Reason I am giving it 2 stars : the fitbit one does not take accurate measurements while on the wrist!<br />While wearing on my wrist the tracker logged 47 stairs climbed, when I had in fact only climbed 2. Also said that I had active minutes during times I know I was seated at a desk."
2.0,"This is OK, but it broke very easily. I am not sure why. It is a great design and my daughter LOVES to make these loom art, but I just can't keep a loom maker in the house without it breaking!"
2.0,"Unfortunately, when I inspected them one had a piece loose and was hanging by a spring.  Unfortunately this was after I glued some Christmas decorations onto the box.  I sent them back."
2.0,I love them but they came with two big indents on the frame.
2.0,...but well made.
2.0,Fits great but see through
2.0,"The Large, despite the sizing chart saying it would fit a U.S. size 14, did not fit as such. Granted, i am tall, @5'10&#34;. It was not long enough in the torso so exchanged for an XL. It fit the exact same way. Not happy i had to pay shipping to return an item that was supposed to be bigger but didn't fit ANY bigger."
2.0,Did not work as we has hoped
2.0,avoid this item and seller.<br />The 2 halves do not match well so they rock up and down as if warped. You risk losing anything that is placed in this so called &#34;floating charm&#34; which falsely implies that the locket keeps and contents dry!<br /><br />.
2.0,"If you have shoulders or chest larger than a highschool freshman, look elsewhere."
2.0,"Really wanted to like this shirt, and I would have if it wouldn't have been for the gaping at the armpit on one side. Only one side. The other side was perfect. But the gaping side had so much extra room you could see straight through the shirt when I turn sideways."
2.0,Material is all rubbed. .. not a fan<br />Also top runs small<br />Could have ordered a whole size up but then the bottoms would have been too big
2.0,"These were advertised as lined, and perfect for outdoors activities. They are not even close to warm enough to be called a base layer."
2.0,Love the message! The keychain itself is on my spare key becs it’s too “chinsie” to survive my everyday keys.
2.0,"Very poor quality. the sleeves are raw and unfinished, and the dress just looks cheaply made."
2.0,They were alot smaller then expected. Mg some is 11 and these are not adjustable so they are to small for him.
2.0,"Runs small, tight across chest"
2.0,Nothing like the image. 2 stars just because the fabric is nice and soft. Does not hang or wear as pictured.
2.0,"These earrings are so cute, I put the stone one in and immediately caught an infection. They are not surgical steel. If your allergic to fake jewelry don’t buy. Plastic one was awesome for my surgery procedure"
2.0,"The earrings are not silver as they appear in the picture but rather a copper/brass tone. The do not stay in the ear, lost one the first day I wore it."
2.0,Not what they picture looks like!
2.0,The material was very thin and you could see my underwear. I returned the dress for a refund.
2.0,Super baggy in the crotch area. The waist band was fine but there was too much fabric to be tight around the groin area
2.0,Way too small. Went with the us size chart and this is almost two sizes too small.
2.0,these are cute as a button but there is no way to know what size to buy..
2.0,"The fabric and construction of this dress was nice. It has a full circle skirt that is “twirly” according to my daughter. It would have been a winner, but the quality of the imprint on the fabric is awful. Looks like a small photo was blown up to be put on the fabric so it’s all blurry and pixelated."
2.0,We bought these for our wedding as a fun gift. However while these looked really cute they were super tight and small for adults.
2.0,"I L I V E D for this bag until today. Was getting out of the car and realized the strap came undone on one side. It was fine when I got in the car! I’m not a person that is rough with bags- my last bag I had for I don’t even know how many years, and only replaced with this because I wanted something smaller. Super disappointed, I would’ve kept this bag for years as well if I could! Not sure what to buy next :("
2.0,I loved it when it came in but soon after my partner dropped it and the fin and tail broke off. I just wish it had been a little more durable.
2.0,"I like the style but they  are to short, I don't have time to send them back. So maybe I can give them  to a shorter person because I'm 5,2 not happy was going  to were them to a party. Do better."
2.0,"The product is not the same as in the picture . The design are all patched upper, lower, pants and vail.  Dupta  fabric is net but the dress is georgette pant is silk. Very light. Looks like it’s from a saree piece.<br />It’s not an elegant piece."
2.0,I was in the army a few years ago. My army boots had steel toes these do not.  I am returning them because they just have leather toes.  The sole is made really well though.  If you dont need them to protect your feet they are a good boot. NOT MILITARY QUALITY
2.0,Had it for 2 days a 1 stone fell out 3 days later 2 more fell out
2.0,"After couple uses, it looks worse, and it water still getting inside"
2.0,i ordered two sizes up because of my bust it is still really tight.
2.0,I didn’t really like how this leggings fit
2.0,"I purchased 2 pairs, one for each of my sons to wear to a wedding. One was a size 6.5 (fit too small) and the other a size 12.5 (fit too big). One came with white stitching like the picture and the other came with a saddle color stitching. What the heck?! Now they won’t match and they are ringbearers in their uncle’s wedding."
2.0,It does not look like the model... It is a flimsy fabric that is very wrinkled. It looks like it would get caught and strings would get pulled out immediately. It looks like a trash bag :(
2.0,No support ran too smsll
2.0,Wore it everyday and today the glue holding it together wore off. Only had it for a few weeks. I love the design but it’s cheaply made.
2.0,Looks nice but is incredibly hard to put on by yourself. You almost need another person to put it on for you.
2.0,Doesn’t really fit my AE Chelsea boots well
2.0,So these are great for deadlifts and squats even running too. The problem I had is I found that on the first day of use I found small several frayed strings and one big one. I’m wondering if the QA missed these socks and when they were sent. I’ll update once I hear back from the company
2.0,they are scratchy as hellll and they break very easily
2.0,"Unattractive to look at, cheaply made. The metal catch appears to be sturdy, however."
2.0,Super cute but cheaply made. ripped by the armpit after one wear.
2.0,The skirt was q bit tight and bunchy. Could have  been perfect if not for that.
2.0,"This nightgown is definitely not what I was expecting.  The material feels like cheap sheets, and not at all soft and cozy. Material was wrinkled and very course, I washed it hoping it would make it soft.  No such luck, and still wrinkled. I wish I had sent it back.. I usually read reviews and base my purchase on that, I don’t know if some of these ladies got a different gown than some of us others, but definitely not worth the money.. I do like the style, the color and the length but that’s the only things I did like.  Don’t like to write bad reviews but I’d rather be honest."
2.0,"Wierd fit, but super comfy for around the house with leggings.  The sleeves are short and the bottom is very wide and doesn’t flow well"
2.0,"I love the fit and comfort of this apron but I was very disappointed when I washed it for the first time and it was completely faded. Also, the pockets are frayed and ripping. I would not recommend spending your money on this apron."
2.0,The sleeves are way to short! It looks crazy on I was very disappointed 😔
2.0,"Marked as a &#34;small&#34; but what I received was a UK 8, US 4 - which was too big (I guess I'm an extra small?), and it went almost to my feet. The bigger problem, however, was that the color online says &#34;wine red&#34; but the dress itself is actually true red - far far too bright. This needs to be relabeled!"
2.0,"The large for this item is for a size 8-10. The waistline is around a 28-inch, maybe 32, which is a squeeze."
2.0,"Looks and feels great. Takes some adjustments. I recommend two glasses size screwdrivers. Fits my Luminox 3050/3950<br /><br />Update:<br />The rubber on the band will break in under a year. The band was worn everyday under normal use conditions. Repaired one broken link, and another broke shortly after."
2.0,"If I wasn’t desperate for a new wallet, I’d send it back. I don’t believe that it’s leather; it’s cheaply made, way too shiny, and just looks and feels like something I could have found for $5. Pretty awful."
2.0,Looks very different picture<br />Complete different
2.0,Hard to figure out how Asian sizing works. Had to return it. Way too small.
2.0,"The material is just not as conducive for keeping your face cool as cotton is.<br />They are pretty and arrived as described, but I find I can only wear these when I'm going to be inside with air conditioning or for very short trips because they just trap heat/moisture."
2.0,Worked fine for the first month.  Now the ratchet loosens by itself.
2.0,"I wanted this strap for my ukulele. However, I cannot make it short enough for me to hold my ukulele right where I play it. Very disappointing."
2.0,Nose grip is really rigid and non-adjustable.
2.0,Cute idea for kids party ... they are really not durable at all.
2.0,I returned this item as too small despite ordering the size that I always wear
2.0,Everything was fine until I was looking at them and some were missing diamonds
2.0,Just order a biggir size cz its run too small.but nice meterial.
2.0,This is a fall jacket.  I was looking for a lightweight fall jacket for my 14 year old son.  This was on super sale so I thought it would be perfect.  My son is average height and weight and if anything on the thinner side.  This is way too small.  Short arms and armpit area cut into his chest. He looked ridiculous.  The extra large would fit a 12 year old.  Definitely do not order for anyone older.  Also the color blue that transitions from light to dark is more dingy than expected.  Returned
2.0,Home printed iron-on quality. Not bright & crisp like the photo.  My kid did like it though.
2.0,Much smaller than size stated. I am very unhappy because I purchased this for our son-in-law for Father’s Day I got at the end of April and he did not open it until June 20 and now I guess there’s an issue was sending it back. The shorts are way smaller than what they say they are. And I should at least be able to return an exchange. Do not purchase these shorts because they are not customer friendly if there’s an issue
2.0,it broke as soon as I got it
2.0,The material feel so good. I’m a size 18 and I did order a 2x but it’s so so small. Very disappointed.
2.0,The look of these watches is not image!
2.0,I bought these during a lightning deal to replace my fading Dr. Scholls insoles. I work 10 hour days standing about 90% of the day. I tried wearing these for 3 days before I swapped them out for my old Dr Scholls due to foot pain.
2.0,More yellow than green not as expected. But ok for the price
2.0,This is not the same shirt as the style without tags.  The collar is not as neat as the &#34;no tag&#34; shirts and the fit is a bit sloppy.  I would not order again.
2.0,Think these are in Chinese sizes.
2.0,It's swimsuit was just way too small ! Bought an extra large but it was more like a small  ! Quality was just okay
2.0,The dress is really pretty the color is silver as specified. Takes a bit to get the ironing right so the top doesn’t flip up and it lays flat. The material is nice and thick as well not cheap. I am taking stars off because mine came used and stained and I had no time to return it since my daughter needed it in 2 days and there were none left in her size. The first one arrived in perfect condition but I ordered a size that was too big for her and couldn’t use it. Had to run and get it dry cleaned which was very upsetting. Amazon customer service was very nice about it and issued a partial refund but getting a used dress for prom was not a pleasant experience.
2.0,VERY WIDE!!!
2.0,The shorts are a good fit but the top had a weird fit. The back was extremely loose and the front did not cover the bottom of my boobs. It was supposed to be a XL but the top fit like a medium on my chest
2.0,Way smaller than expected! Might need to go two sizes up!
2.0,No son lo que yo esperaba lo supuse por el precio pero que ria probar
2.0,Fit is weird. Size down.
2.0,The Color wasn't what I expected.  Ordered gray and what I got was more of a taupe.  Also runs small!
2.0,The mask makes you sweat and breathing is not comfortable.
2.0,"Was disappointed to find that the stones in the rainbow were not colored as shown in picture.  They were clear and the cloud was silver rather than white as shown in picture.  I'd read the same thing about unicorn earrings that appeared colored.  Since this was a gift for my 10 year old granddaughters after Christmas birthday, I kept them but  was very disappointed."
2.0,Not a nice fabric and way smaller then the size chart
2.0,Looked like polished silver but it's not.
2.0,"This band is made of durable silicone rubber and seems like it could be a great product, but sadly I was highly dissapointed. It's extrememly difficult to put it over my wrist w/o the help of another person, which is obviously the biggest drawback. The rubber envelopes the Fit2 where you can't charge it w/o taking it off, and for me the Fit2 didn't read my heartbeat unless the band was tighter than I'd like. Overall a sub-par replacement for the original Fit2 band."
2.0,Did not fit my 8 and 11 year old boys well. When the filter was added the front was awkward and uncomfortable. The gaiter works well as a plain gaiter but not with the added filter.
2.0,"Sensors are not working for VW CC 2012. Like with many aftermarket products, I got the error code ""Incorrect Signal"" on both sides. Resetting the error codes as described in the ad doesn't do anything. Dashboard lights are off for a second and the it's all right back within a second. Ordered other ABS sensors and everything is working fine now."
2.0,"The supima  cotton is wonderfully soft and smooth. Very boxy fit, runs large. Before I ever wore it I put it in wash on delicate cycle and then in drier on permanent press. All my other cottons looked fine. This was a wrinkly mess and the neck was very stretched out!  Plus, since this was listed as petite, I had hopes of ordering  two more in other colors. But the sleeves were unbelievably long, by any human standard. No more Lands End purchases for me!"
2.0,A little disappointed!<br />Just got them in and it doesn't do justice :-(
2.0,"These sports bras are very cheaply constructed. I also didn't care for the way they fit -- for me, they aren't really comfortable enough to wear around the house, and they definitely aren't sturdy enough for workouts."
2.0,The stones fall off after a few weeks of normal use
2.0,Way to Big!!
2.0,They were broken when I got them.
2.0,"This was one of the early listings for non-Apple alpine loop bands. A month later it’s here and it’s a bit disappointing. There’s nothing obviously wrong but from the moment I put it on it felt mildly irritating, especially compared to the near identical black alpine loop imitation I picked up in the interim. It does have “metallic” looking connectors, so if you really need that it’s there. However, after picking up a different version with black accents, I find I prefer that one."
2.0,These earrings are very pretty and in a decent case but 4 out of 6 earrings are broken which was very disappointing.
2.0,I love the style and colors! Highly dislike the sizes. They are way too big!
2.0,way too small for the size.
2.0,I’ve wore them only a couple times and the zipper broke :( they were very cute and fit perfect.
2.0,"For a $20 shirt, I would expect the fabric to be better than a $8 Walmart shirt. The fabric is very rough and uncomfortable. Walmart has better shorts for $20 and even a shorts store has amazing quality for $30, this shirt is not worth $20"
2.0,For a $70 pair of underwear these don't fit. They're too high waisted and often doesn't give you any support for your junk.
2.0,Bought this dress. It was. See through
2.0,"I'm giving 3 stars just because it was way to big! I normally wear and XL and I was swimming in this shirt, so I will be returning, it is super cute, fabric is nice and airy, and the color is perfect and as pictured (I got the light blue one) I just with this wasn't so big!"
2.0,Misleading title/product description. This product is not organic.
2.0,"It fits great! Not clingy or to tight, I'm 5'2 tho and it's an inch or two too short. Would be hard for a taller person."
2.0,the shoulder strap is super wrinkled and trash. LOW quality.
2.0,The reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I ordered the item in blue and I received it in black.
2.0,"Won't stay on glasses, slips off, no good."
2.0,I hate the material! Cheap fabric.
2.0,"The earrings were beautiful, but the backs came off easily.  Several previous reviewers commented on this.  I lost one pair because it came apart.  I think I was brushing my hair from my face."
2.0,To big sleeves are way to long
2.0,Not my favorite Verdusa item.  Did not look like the picture.  Looks super cheap:(.
2.0,"This hat has a weird fit. I have a small head and it still wouldn't stay on, I'm guessing it's because of the material. Either way, save your money or just order from V.S. directly."
2.0,I give two stars because the earrings themselves seem good quality and i like the twist on back closure. HOWEVER - I bought these for my double helix piercing and they are NOT long enough! Maybe it's my particular cartilage thickness. They do not work for me.
2.0,"So excited when I tried it on and fit nice and material is soft too, however looked in the mirror and above the stripes is big round blue ink spot! Will return it sadly."
2.0,"Nice boots, runs a little big"
2.0,Didn't like it.  It was broke whe I got it.
2.0,Cute style but very small. Made for a really slim foot.
2.0,The temples and temple tips are not comfortable at all.
2.0,I bought this for my fiance for his birthday. I didn't give it to him yet but I tried it on myself and the sleeves are entirely too long. The elastic band is too loose and it doesn't keep the sleeves in place. It seems like it'll be very warm but it's not going to do much good if the arms are swimming in the sleeves.
2.0,too loose and shapeless.  Not worth $75.
2.0,fit about 2 sizes too small
2.0,It feels like cheap polyester. Many reviews said it ran small. I ordered a size up and it was still too tight. This dress needs a larger bust to fill it out. I sent it back.  There are two cuts of this dress: v-neck and not. I had the v-neck.
2.0,The lens popped out after 3 days
2.0,I just received this in the mail and I’m super bummed it doesn’t come inflated we don’t own a air compressor or hand pump so now I have to go buy one  and now from reading previous reviews sounds like the ball has trouble holding air
2.0,"Light weight, not for yoga will show your stomach in downward dog"
2.0,To small for me...
2.0,Pretty looking<br />Nice color but uncomfortable
2.0,"I was so excited my daughter got these for me. When u put them on and wear for about 5 minutes, what ever chemical they have on them gave my legs a rash . There was no care instructions with them. So I hand washed and hung dry but as they were being hand washed the color was bleeding off them the green. But that chemical had to come off so can wear them . Very disapointed because hand washing no color should ever come off so here is a picture of what they look like."
2.0,"I like the material, but I laughed when I pulled it out of the bag.  Not the fit or look like the photo advertised."
2.0,"Cheap product. Love the look, but after a few uses, the blue pieces just fell off. They are just little pieces of plastic stuck onto the metal of the cufflinks. Get what you pay for I guess. Good news is they look decent without the blue at all, so not a total loss."
2.0,"Very cheap, not that comfortable. Underwear material sowed into a different shape. But I guess it’s better than nothing. Would not recommend. Buy one with an elastic strap that goes around the head not the ear."
2.0,"This item was not was what pictured in advertisement, the picture to me looks like a thicker material, but it is rather is a thinner material. And just as many other reviews claimed, there is a tight band on top of skirt, uncomfortable. So get a size bigger maybe."
2.0,After using 1 of these bags a total of 3 times the stitching ripped! I was not carrying anything too heavy in it either. I would not buy again.
2.0,"The construction is fine, but the dye they used to make the belt brown rubbed off onto my pants, leaving a permanent stain. Although the staining is largely hidden by a belt, this still represents extremely poor processing of the leather."
2.0,"I got 3 different sized items. I ordered a Large, and got an XL jacket, L vest, and 4XL pants. If it were all the correct size it may be a great deal, but it's not. Fabric quality isn't bad, just doesn't fit how it should, and I'm almost identical in body type as the manikin."
2.0,Did not receive the ring in the picture. However it is still beautiful and I think it is sterling silver
2.0,"I love these earrings, however, the clasps are very loose and earrings keep falling off! I just lost one and have re- ordered another pair to see if the clasps are any better. Love the look, not happy with the quality"
2.0,This is my second bracelet I wish the item would last longer the inside of the goo starts to mold or rot but I will get another one makes my ache knees a little less achy. Crazy
2.0,about 20 out of the 40 lights did not turn on. I needed them for an event and I was very disappointed and embarrassed in front of my team.
2.0,"Watch sizing, small on top"
2.0,2 stars due to color not matching description
2.0,"Not satisfied. It was cheaply made. The stone wouldn't even fit on the necklace right and the metal to hold the stone was cheaply glued on. Looks like it could pop off at any moment because it's so loose. Its a nice necklace yes, but it was poorly put together and I won't buy from BRCbeads again."
2.0,runs small. im a 36dd and should have ordered a bigger size
2.0,"Our daughter loved it, but accidentally dropped it two feet onto a coffee table when attempting to put it on and the screen shattered."
2.0,Really good size purse. My handles broke off within 2 months and the purse started to look really dingy and old. Definatley not an every day purse. Quality sucks
2.0,Was dirty when it arrived.
2.0,"color was disappointingly dull, not neon at all as pictured.  the fit was ok, but material looked and felt very cheap.  I would not recommend it at all.  Sorry"
2.0,Colors were pretty but a size too small.  Made in China -
2.0,"The fit and design are odd. I am 5'10&#34;, 160lbs. It was just a bit too tight on the shoulders but manageable. I'm returning it because the draw strings are way to high up on the chest, almost at my neck. Am the pocket is also too high. I really wanted to love it"
2.0,"Itchy, Large, Way Too LONG...This is NOT a good buy for less than tall women. But it is VERY PRETTY, the rash I got was NOT, however. Customer Service returned with no issues, so that was great. If you can wear Synthetic fabrics, the newer synthetics, you might love this dress. It runs very LONG, this model looks of moderate size, I'm only 5'3&#34; and the dress fell to the middle of my shins... the photo shows it just below the knee. And the dress, if you are tall, does look that nice. The blue here is a deep, wonderful true midnight blue so it will stand out, in a lovely way, from all the now standard &#34;black dresses.&#34; If it were natural fiber and Petite sized, I'd snap it right up."
2.0,Loved the dress but not made for a short and stout woman.
2.0,Does not have the wide neck as shown in the picture. It looks like a weird night gown and the material is not right for this style.  The fit was smaller and not the relaxed look shown. Not to happy with this one.
2.0,This dress runs small. Fabric is thinner than I’d hoped. Returning.
2.0,its ok fit well but the color is not the same
2.0,"Way too heavy, I have marks on my nose after wearing them for only a few minutes."
2.0,NOT MY STYEL ..
2.0,"These swim goggles are only good for children or if you have a very small head! For me, the water constantly kept coming into the goggles and I had to keep emptying them.  What a pain in the neck!!<br /> I ended up giving them to the neighbor’s children and they very happy to have them.<br />Don’t buy this for an adult!!"
2.0,"These sneakers are pretty awful.  They run small and narrow as does another style of shoes from this brand.  There is no padding under the sole which might be fine for kids/teens but is very uncomfortable for adults.  Also, they arrive completely flattened and with zero shape.  And, frankly, IMO, they're pretty ugly.  I'm giving them to my daughter to use while gardening."
2.0,Was not the width advertised. Was able to return it though
2.0,No coverage top section. I can only use as a swimsuit coverup because the top is too narrow and shows too much bra
2.0,It’s beautiful. And they were quick to respond to my complaint. It is tiny. The size of a bracelet charm.  Not a necklace. I returned it and expect a refund.
2.0,It doesn't stick in the nose and while sleeping it slides out.
2.0,"It’s small, and the seams are super uncomfortable- they’re really big and scratch on your arms, and even if you wear a long sleeve shirt under it you can still feel the seams.  Hoodie is see through, don’t wear anything but white under it.  It does have kinda soft material and it looks the same as the picture.  I ordered it on the 5th, and it was supposed to come on the 16th-22nd.  I ordered mine the same time as my sister so we could have matching hoodies.  She let me try hers on since hers came first, which is how I was able to review it.  Mine however is still in Hong Kong (I live in America) and Im going to refund it  or something as soon as Amazon lets me."
2.0,Earrings were nice size for my daughter but caused her newly pierced ears to react. Would not recommend as I highly doubt the 14k gold is real.
2.0,The wings were literally huge. Way too big to be cute. Wanted something more dainty
2.0,Even though it has the drawstring inside the band to adjust it when I get it to fit my head it just doesn't look right.  It was smushed up into a small package and seems to want to remain in that shape.  The brim is way too wide and if I push it back far enough to uncover my nose it is too far down in the back.  I have to keep my head bent forward or the brim hits my back and pops off backward. I just cannot wear it.
2.0,"These bands look and feel nice. The colors were true to the description but when trying to attach to a 38mm watch, they are just too wide so I had to return. If you’re looking for something for the larger watch face, these would be fine."
2.0,"Didn't like this product because 1. it was itchy, and 2. it broke after wearing it twice."
2.0,"I really wanted to be excited for these adorable shoes. The bananas fell out as I opened the package.  Its possibly they were never attached in the first place, negating the entire reason for purchase. Considering how long shipping took (like 6 weeks) I decided to forgo the return process, since I doubt my daughter would even fit by the time they were replaced. I'm planning on gluing themthemon, but honestly,  they are just sitting in the junk drawer while mu daughter has been wearing them without. All in all, pretty unimpressed"
2.0,They’re not bad for the price. But I was delivered a set smaller than what I ordered. I bought 6g but I believe these are 8g. Oh well. I suggest orderedimg a size up.
2.0,I got these for my son he had them on for about an hour or so in the stroller and the strap in the back broke. With him being one now he cant keep them on his feet. They were cute and fit perfectly too so was a bummer they didnt last even a weekend
2.0,"These shades are pretty, but they're quite uncomfortable to wear as they don't sit properly on the nose."
2.0,"The dress looks much different in person. If you have a larger bust, this dress is not for you! The Dress is also tight in the arms. Also the bottom half of the dress has no shape. It’s a beautiful color, but it’s not for me."
2.0,The masks were small and uncomfortable.
2.0,It's way too small!!
2.0,"Material felt good but it fit tight in the crotch and the flare didn’t look right, too narrow. Had to return."
2.0,"The bail is different than in the photo.  It is a plain, smooth bail without the engraved lines shown in the photo.  The prongs to hold the coin in place are very difficult to bend, and almost impossible to do without causing at least some unintended marking / bending even if you pad your pliers with cloth or rubber.  I’m honestly not sure the item is completely sterling silver, even though it is stamped.  One positive is that the items were packed well and shipped fast, but I wouldn’t buy this again."
2.0,"Eci used to be one of my favorite brands, but this dress is too thin. I sent it back."
2.0,"If this was made in a thinner Cotton material, i would rave about it, because it’s very cute and the fit is very comfortable. But the thick material is a little scratchy and you can tell that after a wash or 2, it’s going to start to pill. Cheap material, but it’s a cheap price. It was made with better material i would buy in every color. Maybe in the fall w cooler weather I’ll appreciate it more ?"
2.0,There is no stretch to these! I really am not sure anyone but an extremely thin child could fit into these!
2.0,It has been washed twice and it doesnt seem it will hold much longer.
2.0,Decal is peeling off after a few washes.
2.0,You would want to wear this in the fall or winter not spring.
2.0,Print has the smell of garbage that cannot be washed out. Never had this issue in a shirt ever.
2.0,"It was tight going over my head, was disappointed on the fit.  Not comfortable, thought it would be much better than the usual masks."
2.0,"The jumper runs small. I am a true 12/14 and sized up to a XXL and it was still no hang to it, it snugged every curve. Also, the color was not as vibrant and deep as the picture, it was the colors, but mor dull. I wanted to love it so bad, but had to return it."
2.0,"Quality is fine but looks nothing like the picture. Different stripes, different coloring, and different texture. Pretty bummed but that’s what I get for buying an item with only one other review:/"
2.0,Not very nice fit!
2.0,looks and feels low quality
2.0,"The cut and design is really nice but the material is ruff, colors are not at all as the product presented and it has avery strong smell i think from the printing<br />I put it out door for two days hopping to loss this smell but didn't work<br />I reall like your designs but you have to enhance your quality, i would rather pay more for better quality it will inreach the product no dought"
2.0,This is not a good bra for those who wear larger sized bras.  It does NOT hold you up and it cuts into you at the closure.  The closer at the front does not lay flat and its not supportive at all.  Nice idea but fails to deliver.
2.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet. The stones are outstanding BUT, the bracelet easily comes off. I know some time in the future I will end up losing it."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:f17aab5f279ce1c36220a8a3d1b9afd]] Simply arrived damaged Zipper was separated couldn’t put it together shirt quality is ok fitting little loose I would a kept it if it wasn’t damaged because the price was inexpensive, fabric was ok."
2.0,Despite tightening it the screw part kept loosening up.  Eventually I just had to throw out within two months of wear
2.0,Quality is good but it fit too small
2.0,Cute. Fits true to size. Comfortable. Unfortunately it’s totally see through. Would be ok for a swimsuit cover up but not a real dress to wear out
2.0,"I was very hopeful when I ordered this.  It said non-binding which is something I was looking for.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to that claim.  It does have a roll top and there isn't elastic around the entire opening like most socks have.  But there is a strip of elastic across the top.  After wearing it for a few minutes it started to hurt.  I kept the socks on for about an hour and had ridges along the top of my foot from that elastic strip.  Even though the elastic didn't go all the way around it still cut off circulation where it was.  :("
2.0,"These were too hard for me to put on.  I could sleep in them, but just a pain to put in."
2.0,What do you except for twelve dollars?
2.0,"Well, your ponytail definitely fits through but...It’s not warm."
2.0,These are cute. If you have a large face I don’t recommend this. They are small on me and I have large head
2.0,I got these for when I ride my scooter in the winter. It is only 38 degrees and my hands were freezing I plan on returning them. The grip and touch work great but that’s not what I got them for.
2.0,"The plastic ends break in pieces. Not impressed. It breaks after being worn for only a short time, mostly the daith piercings."
2.0,Wasn't one of my favorite..But i like more of cotton spandex kind of legging..These were shiny
2.0,"Very thin, run small"
2.0,Need to Write on description that it is for women 5’ 8” and taller... I’m 5’5” and with 3” heels it’s still too long. 😢
2.0,The star fish broke very soon after I bought the product and I could not get it to go back on.
2.0,"For me a skinny jean is a skinny jean and a super skinny jean is skinnier than that. This is not a super skinny jean as advertised or shown in images. Granted body types are different, but the fit is no where near as skinny as what is shown. Had I know this before purchasing I would not have bought these jeans. There is stretch to the pants an they are by no means uncomfortable, but if you are looking to have a good pair of tight jeans all around, these are not the jeans for you."
2.0,The print was upside down on both masks
2.0,Couldn’t use them because The package did not include pins to attach the straps to my watch…
2.0,The shirt is made with thin material. i am returning it.
2.0,Super shiny cheap looking gold.
2.0,"Absolutely loved these glasses, super stylish and looked great... for about a week. I was even extra gentle with them and kept them in a case when not wearing them but they still fell apart after just a few days. Both screws on the left side of the lens fell out and are no longer wearable. Super disappointed. I mean I know they're not expensive glasses but usually my inexpensive sunglasses atleast last me a few months to a year before I have to replace them."
2.0,"seem to be an okay product, just larger than expected."
2.0,made for wide feet
2.0,I purchases this shirt and a couple of Columbia shirts to take on a trip to Europe to hand wash and dry quickly.  The first time I washed it in like warm water ALL of the button holes frayed and I could not unbutton the shirt.  I spent the rest of the trip leaving it buttoned and pulling it over my head like a T-shirt.  I was totally disappointed with this shirt.  The Columbia shirts did not have this issue.
2.0,Out of the 6 pair of underwear only 4 fit. The 2 black pair were 2 small like they put 2 of the wrong size in the package even though they are labeled with the correct size. If these 2 fit then I would have given 5 stars because they are soft and comfortable and like the longer leg but I feel I got ripped off because I bought a 6 pack and basically received 4.
2.0,The earrings were too thin. One side would not stay closed.
2.0,Not good quality and came apart.
2.0,I mean the ring fits I would of like a bigger stone
2.0,Over priced for what they are.
2.0,material is very cheap!
2.0,I don’t know how to wear it
2.0,I ordered these shoes and somehow they started off tight and cozy and now it has loosened up and is now too big! I am not sure what happened to it.
2.0,"Lightweight material, but whatever synthetic it's made of is too hot and scratchy for summer. Returning."
2.0,Smaller than 1/2&#34;
2.0,I am 5’6 and weigh 220 and I ordered a large. I would prefer 1 size smaller so that it fits more like the picture. The material was okay but not expensive looking. This is definitely something that you need to jazz up with cute shoes/accessories.
2.0,"Cool idea but just doesn’t work well. First, there are no bristles on the tips so you kinda forced to wash stuff with the palm of you hand. Not sure if this makes sense but it’s just not a natural way one would do it. Second, while wearing gloves your dishes become super slippery (Obviously) and you have no control so I alway afraid of dropping something."
2.0,I was very excited to receive this watch this morning only to open a Box up and find out the wood frame that houses the watch is cracked.  I will assume that wood is not a good frame for a watch.
2.0,"The description says 9×7 but the item is actually smaller. I didn't return because i can give as gift to an 8 year old. Otherwise, i have to search again for a saddle bag that can fit a 7inch wallet"
2.0,I’m 5’2” 200lbs and this shirt was wayyyy too short. I got my normal size XL.
2.0,this belt was my highlight of getting an amazon gift card for graduation i just wanted a belt that would fit me and look cute but i got neither i understood the belt would have been size 4’s and up but the missing pieces was what really got me. and one of the holes looked used tf out of 😵‍💫
2.0,"Made for the female or male with no shape, no butt, no boobs. If you are a board, then you will like this slip."
2.0,Runs super small!!!! I had to return it
2.0,Didn’t fit was a little too big on me didn’t like the loose fit I’m 40 boost medium waist 😏
2.0,Not a good surf watch as suggested in the questions section.  Bought one to use for surfing and it went out after a couple months.  I ordered another one because they're so cheap and it stopped working after a couple months.  You can't beat the price for this watch but I wouldn't suggest it for regular water activities.
2.0,"Nice but very cheap, chain broke within 3 days of having it."
2.0,Gave me the wrong size ...ok quality.
2.0,I purchased this shirt and wore it once in August and washed and hung to dry. I just went to wear the shirt and the lettering and imagine was hardened and crumbled and not able to be worn again. Sad because the original wear and fit were comfortable!
2.0,Not very nice. Hard and scratchy.
2.0,Very cute but the size was too small. It is not true to size.
2.0,Of course you think you're getting what is pictured but the colors aren't nearly as vibrant and the print is smaller so it does not  wrap the face.
2.0,These glasses are nice but they ARE NOT polarized!They are definitely not as black as the picture.
2.0,"This is okay, but not worth 17-18 dollars--more like 10. I usually take a large but ordered a medium based on past experience. It fit fine before washing but shrank a lot in the wash (luke warm, warm, not hot, dryer)--about 3 inches at the hem, sleeves and a smaller amount around the waist. Should have ordered the large. The fabric is light and very soft."
2.0,not as long in length as in picture
2.0,Not real silver. Just silver plated..
2.0,"the watch is a nice watch, but the ban is so big that i can put it on without opening the clasp.  It's way to bulky and somewhat heavy for a woman's wrist.  Unless you have a super thick wrist, the ban will be too large.  It was nice looking so I gave it to my husband.  By the way, it fit his wrist perfectly and he's 190 pounds."
2.0,It was made for tiny years my friend and I was like average her size and I got it for her and it just didn’t fit right and I have pretty big ears and I just didn’t fit right I feel extremely uncomfortable
2.0,"That dress was of poor quality, it looks cheap!"
2.0,"This necklace is beautiful, but the clasp broke the first time I wore it."
2.0,Material was itchy
2.0,Minute size—very very disappointed—-horrible price<br />for puny  child-sized earrings !!  Deceived by pictures online. They are the size of adult fingernail!!
2.0,"These are better suited for young kids, elementary age."
2.0,"These are small in size you can not even read it from few feets away. Changes its color, basically silver comes out only after few usage. Cheap made not worth the money."
2.0,You have to be very small chested and narrow hips for this dress to fit tge way it is shown in the picture. The color is amazing and tge satin has a good hand to it but the sizing was way off. I would have needed 2 larger sizes to achieve the draped look.
2.0,"These where huge. Way to big, definitely order a few sizes down. They where kind of a weird material, just not what I was expecting. Cute design but didn’t fit at all"
2.0,"I bought these to use while walking to work in cold weather and use my phone at the same time.  These gloves are moderately warm, though my hands were still a bit cold in &#60;32* weather.  My main issue with these gloves is that they are very slippery for holding your phone.  I felt I was going to have my phone slip through my hand all the time.  And the finger tips do not consistently work on the touchscreen.  You have to be very particular and use the very middle of the fingertip material.  The fit was good, and they seem durable, but for use with a phone I found them very lacking."
2.0,"They are cute and fun but pretty much a wear once and throw out, if they don't break first. They tangle easily and almost don't untangle at all. But, for the price, I wouldn't expect much more. Cute statement peices"
2.0,Really see-through. Might be good for a cover up but the sweater large-loop material is confusing for summer.
2.0,Rope necklace very weak.
2.0,Looks better in picture. Not as furry inside as it looks .<br />I like that it is light. I like the sole also.
2.0,"Fit as expected, poor quality, colors dull"
2.0,I have owned this for a bit over two years. It worked great until just now and just stopped working. For such a simple device I would expect a longer useful life.
2.0,"The sunglasses look great, fit great, but the blue hued tint dulls everything down, the reds are too muted and when driving then color contrast, well can be almost dangerous. I would definitely not recommend these glasses for driving."
2.0,"Liked it a lot! Only thing is I wore it for maybe 3 days and it broke! A replacement should be issued, but my return time ran out, not fair! I have several so wasn’t wanting to wear it as soon as I got it."
2.0,"This dress is beautiful but not true to size at all. I sent it back. The material is so thin. I ordered a 3X (usually a 2X) and it still was way too small. It showed every little curve, roll and dimple. It may be good as a swimsuit cover up but not a dress. Maybe its just me but I did not want everything showing."
2.0,Was happy that it fit my wrist that's in between typical band sizes.  But broke in a month.
2.0,"These run super small! I’m usually an 8, but ordered a 10 and could barely get these halfway up my thighs. They’re a cheap material, but I guess that’s to be expected for $10. They have a very strong chemical smell when you open the package, so definitely wash them before you try to wear them anywhere."
2.0,The shirt design looks cute but the fabric is far from soft and doesn't fall nicely on the body.
2.0,"Seems like these are nice quality pants, but I specifically was looking for husky sweatpants for my grandson and the waist on these are definitely not husky. I have purchased husky pants from other stores so know the difference between regular sizing and larger sizes. These are generously cut in the legs and hips, but the elastic waistband is proportionately smaller than the rest of the garment. And the packaging says size 10... no reference at all to being 10Husky. Had to send them back."
2.0,Fell apart after a month
2.0,"This fades after one wash even in cold water. This does not hang off the shoulder like the image. It has a round collar, not scoop like what is shown."
2.0,"Wanted to love these - but they are completely see through.  I saw another review stating that they were a silky material.  Mine are not silky at all or smooth, more of a linen.  Can completely see through them.  Very sad, am returning."
2.0,I bought this for a friend and it fell apart within 2 times wearing it. It is very pretty but I would not purchase another one. It is cheaply made. Very disappointed.
2.0,Material is fine. Buttons were in the wrong place. Buttons should of  been in center.
2.0,"Ordered in a XXL thinking it'd be big on me, however this product ran somewhat smaller than expected. I would guess the XXL I ordered fit like a Large. The material is very thin, so be mindful of what undergarments you're wearing with it."
2.0,"I bought thinking it would be a compression shirt, but instead I got what feels like a polyester type shirt that fits to lose for being a medium. Overall not a good buy, so if your looking for an actual compression shkrt, this is not it."
2.0,"Disappointed in the fabric. Can't believe they moved to such poor quality fabric, way too thin. You can see right through to skin. I always purchase Hanes products, but this was disappointing."
2.0,"These would be as comfortable as my old and loved Waldies (which they quit making!).... but they are so wide that walking in them would be dangerous.  Oh, how I wish sandal makers would give us a choice on the width!"
2.0,I went with the description and these are a bit larger than expected. Very long and with this weird bulge around the ankle. Got them on easily but I doubt they’d offer adequate compression. Otherwise they appear well made. They might work for you if you have thick lower legs and you find it difficult to be fitted for compression stockings.
2.0,The sticker letters are very cheap and pink in color from color bleeding from sweater.
2.0,"The lining is stiff like paper.  The faux leather is flimsy, but it is light on the body.  It has plenty of room and three outside zippered pockets.  One is perfect for a mobil phone.  The zippers are stiff and the main one is hard to open."
2.0,"wouldn't recommend for 14 year old, not well made"
2.0,Too big but I waited to long to send back
2.0,I decided to order a larger size just in case if ran small....well it runs very very small.  Try to order 3 times your size for it to fit.
2.0,"Hanes has no consistency in their sizing at all. Ordered same size as I had previously and these are twice the size. Apparently depends on which Chinese factory they're sewn at. I've found the same to be true with their T-shirts, only the size varies by what color it is."
2.0,"I bought these shoes as a easy option for the winter. Although they keep my feet warm and dry, they do not hold up on slippery snow. I fell in my driveway. There is no traction to them to prevent you from slipping."
2.0,They are smaller than expected and some come in Spanish which is fine but what if you don't speak Spanish
2.0,I like how the ugh look... but is too big
2.0,First issue (vendor) is that I paid substantially more than the &#34;Suggested List&#34; that is marked right on the product.  That is probably why they show it to you without the standard Buxton sales card in it.<br /><br />Second issue is that the cards insert from the top instead of the inside edge like the one I am replacing.  Not sure if this is a mod by the mfr or a different part number.  This design makes them fall out more easily.
2.0,Granddaughter likes it but the material that came as the chain immediately pulled out of the piece that held the 2 ends together. It is not very sturdy.
2.0,I will keep this to use as an around the house short bathrobe. This does not look like something I would want to wear in public.
2.0,"Cheap price, poor quality. Nothing unexpected"
2.0,Much smaller than expected. They do post the size but the photos make appear MUCH larger. UNHAPPY
2.0,"The black and grey color bands are fine so far, but the &#34;metal&#34; color band seems to be spray painted and after only a few days the paint has begun to wear off."
2.0,cut way too large on top of dress
2.0,Not the color shown. Green fringe. Yuk.
2.0,"It was okay, but, didn't fit to good,. I'm plus size, and I could never get the right size for me, also very uncomfortable.  I sent back,. and didn't want another one"
2.0,"I bought two Original Turtle Fur Fleece, one for myself and one for my husband.  First, the hats were too small when pulled down to cover ears.  We both have average size heads.  We had to tug to get the hat off.  I think these hats would better fit an older child rather than an adult.  Second, the fleece fabric was flimsy, not what expected.  On the plus side, the Blue Whimsy and Peat colors were very pretty.  Returned both hats - very disappointed in the quality and fit."
2.0,The color is too dark not like what is on the picture. It's even missing a stone
2.0,Looks good and fashionable but material picks too much
2.0,"Poorly made, see-through and super itchy. Not worth the money at all."
2.0,"The cut was kind of cute but still not good enough since the giant draping triangle shape always succeeds to make your chest look really bad. Even with a belt it was too ugly and too much fabric under my arms, so I returned it. The fabric wasn't great."
2.0,"Wanted to love this item, but it is so short in the legs and arms that it doesn't serve the purpose I purchased it for, which is keeping the sun off my baby. Seems well made and love the light material that dries quickly, but needs more length."
2.0,"I wasn't expecting much from a Halloween costume at this price, but it was so cheaply made and itchy that it has to be returned. It was so small that the sleeves squired my daughter's arms and she's pretty small. I can't imagine the average child feeling comfortable in it. The headband is thin felt glued to a thin plastic band. The ears arrived bent an no smoothing would fix them. Overall just a big disappointment."
2.0,not strong enough too hold cards
2.0,It is super tiny
2.0,I bought one of these shirts about 2 years ago and loved it and wore it until it got a little ratty. Decided to replace the ole work horse. The new one is of a thinner shirt material. Though it is comfy and fits the same as the old one (it's not tight) you can clearly see my bra and cleavage through the black shirt. Bummer.<br /><br />I reccommend if you don't expect much coverage from a shirt.
2.0,"Bought a pair last year. Liked them a lot but buckles got loose, tried to tighten a bit with needle nose pliers. Broke with just the slightest pressure"
2.0,"A functional, stylish card wallet for such a bargain? Seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately it was. While I love this little card holder, the zipper on the card side broke within the first month. Maybe other customers had better experiences with the quality of this product, based on my experience I'd advise prospective buyers to invest in a different wallet."
2.0,"i actually ordered two of these suits in different colors. The striped one fit wonderfully and is more than i could've expected for the price. I would give that one 5 stars. But this one, which was advertised as red but was very definitely a bright, almost fluorescent, pink (so that I couldn't mix and match these two like I expected to be able to), is way too large on top (they were both the same size), but in a weird way...like it's been stretched out. And the elastic around the bottom band of the top flips and moves. I guess it's a roll of the dice if you get a good one or a bad one."
2.0,"I was surprised at the terrible quality of this dress. It is paper thin, scratchy material...kind of like what you would expect for doll clothing. The fit wasn't awful but definitely not something I would want to put on and wear in public."
2.0,Not in love with the bag.  The lining on the inside very poorly made.
2.0,I love it but unfortunately I didn't receive  the 2 invisible shoulder straps and 1 invisible back strap. And basically this is the reason I bought this bra... Very disappointing. (((
2.0,"Over the past year, we had four that had the bottoms fall right off in one piece. It wasn't a big mess, but still, dangerously sharp. We purchased more from a different brand."
2.0,"After putting on some weight, I was fairly desperate for a pair of comfortable pair of faux jeans that passed more as jeans than leggings. Needless to say, I liked my first pair so much that I preceded to buy two more over the course of many months. I absolutely loved the fit and how flattering these were for a curvy frame. I got the medium and it fit very well, but honestly the material itself is not the best. My first pair began to tear at the pockets in the back, but alas, I had not found a pair that was comfortable and looked good... So I bought another one which is faring far better, no tears at he pockets or seams. The third pair I ordered, however, and that which changed my opinion of the seller, is the fact that I was sent a used pair! No tags, smelled like some one threw in in the wash, and worn out. I could not believe that Amazon was sending me a used pair of pants for 98 $ !!!! Simply for that fact, I would be wary of buying these pants on here."
2.0,"Bought these for my honeymoon in Aruba. They fit great and were very cute, but they fell apart after only three times wearing them."
2.0,"These things looked awesome when initially opened. And if your only goal in washing dishes is to avoid touching the dirty water, these could absolutely work for you. If you're wanting things like comfort though, maybe read on before purchasing.<br /><br />I ordered the largest size they have, but still found these to be quite tight in the hands. Nothing felt natural while wearing these, and every movement was a chore. I found myself using 2 hands for tasks I could usually get done with just one. Things were easy to drop (in spite of the grips), because it's hard to tell what you do (or don't) have a grip on. The temperature of the water transferred quickly through these gloves, and lingered (beware of overly hot water). And when I finally took the gloves off, my hands and arms smelled like condoms until I full-on showered.<br /><br />I can appreciate how this item is priced. It's great that they come in a 2-pack. And maybe most of my complaints are just the woes of early usage (maybe things will improve, that is to say). But at the moment, I'd rather endure dirty dishwater, and lotioning afterward, than to use this item again. A time and a place for them? Perhaps. But I did not enjoy this experience."
2.0,It’s very cute but the chain tarnished after 2 short wears.
2.0,Everything is great with these no ride boxers except there isn’t a way to relieve yourself without pulling them down. There isn’t a slit or hole like most men’s underwear have.
2.0,Some of the material feels like a table cloth and just looks trashy.
2.0,"My daughter had a pair we thought was this exact model but when we reordered after her feet grew out of old pair, the new pair squeezed her feet where laces originate. We fussed all we could with tongue, etc but it was too uncomfortable. The width and length were fine. Maybe defected pair?? Return cost too much money to try again with new pair."
2.0,This quality is just bad. My kid only used the shoes for one week and they started too peel off ..... they look good Bd comfortable but for a little kid won’t stand
2.0,A couple cords popped after wearing for only one day. Shipping was fast.
2.0,This looks nice but the stitching on the tie loop and bottom started coming loose within weeks.
2.0,Didn't stay on feet
2.0,"I bought this purse to wear when I’m going out. From afar it’s cute, but when you look closely the stitching is kinda bad and there’s visible scratches on the gold closure clasp. The strap also has an undone thread that’s sticking out. I’m a little disappointed about that. I think this purse was overpriced and not worth what I paid for it. It’s kinda cheap looking but I’ll still wear it. I wouldn’t recommend this and won’t be buying anything else from this seller."
2.0,"The tops are either made of thick cotton (black) or of a thin, fabric that is a bit sheer but NOT made of cotton (maybe a satiny organza? Idk)<br /><br />The shirts are super small. I ordered a size up (XL) and it still barely fit over my chest. Would only recommend only for A cups bearing women who are extremely slim to look like the pic or just for anyone who wants their tummy completely out."
2.0,Normally I love their products but not a fan of these. The colors are VERY juvenile and the back strip is very wide.
2.0,The letters were smudged with black ink. And the whole necklace is like it came out of a gumball machine.
2.0,The size chart does not match the sizing for this product. It runs very small! Usually I am a large in all things
2.0,"Bought these in March, when they aren't being worn they are hung up or in a soft sunglass sleeve inside of a hard zippered/padded case, by July the coating was chipping/peeling and they have done nothing but gotten worse to where I can't wear them because of the light difference. The fit the original frames absolutely perfect, but the quality is one of those things about getting what you paid for, Oakley lenses are $70+ for a set and these were $15, there's a reason for the price difference. I'll save some money and just buy Oakley lenses when I get replacements the next time."
2.0,I wanted to love these but both my granddaughters get frustrated with the fact the socks just won't stay up. Constantly slipping down and falling off.
2.0,Great look. Nice material. Size not right
2.0,"garment split down the back first time I tried it on, never got to wear it"
2.0,"Fits my Timex Expedition Stainless indiglo day/date watch perfectly. But I noticed after just a short time it started leaving a red metallic stain on my wrist whenever I sweated or wore it in the rain. (Pretty much every day) I thought this would quit after a few months but so far it hasn't. Then the small stud which secures the lower part of the clasp to the upper part pulled out of the hole in the lower clasp. Since I am not where I can readily replace the band, I cleaned the clasp up and re-installed the stud into the hole using J-B Weld to secure it in place. After allowing sufficient time for the epoxy to cure, the watch was returned to service and is currently undergoing field testing to verify the repair.<br />Seriously, it is an inexpensive replacement band for a Timex watch. The original band lasted about five years. This one, about 4 months. Next time I will just buy another watch."
2.0,"Very nice material, but be aware there is a hole/slit running to halfway down the pant legs. This is great if you're in China and/or doing a diaper-free method, but otherwise you'll have to sew it up."
2.0,"They are okay but a few were too small, the all were the same size"
2.0,Pretty dress with bad finishing.  Lace around the neck area was untidy with lots of loose thread hanging out
2.0,Cute but i dont thinkbits really 14k coated because my ears turned green. That doesnt happen when its actual 14k gold or silver. So it makes sense because of the price- but not what it claims to be.
2.0,"Cute dress on the model. Not so cute on me. But I think it's just a personal preference and body type issue. This might work for you, just did not for me."
2.0,"Oh no, these are thinner than my t-shirt. I'm looking for work pants, this type of material won't do. It would most likely rip, also zippers are not pockets, just for show."
2.0,Cute but very cheaply made. Would not recommend.
2.0,Sizing is way off with this shirt. I ordered 2 sizes up and it was still too tight to be comfortable so it was returned.
2.0,"These are soft and comfortable overall, but they are NOT as depicted in the picture. The written description seems to have updated to suggest the product is only 2 layers, but the above picture remains with the 3 layers of protection. Was hoping less modification would be needed for protection but am pretty disappointed by the misrepresentation."
2.0,The dress definitely requires major alterations from the breast area.
2.0,"Way too see through, I am returning the skirt for that reason alone. Sucks because everything else about it is great, perfect cut and fit and print, zipper constructed well, love the slit especially that it's towards the front not the side. But it is unwearable due to the sheerness, and because the slit you can't wear a slip even if you wanted to. I ordered medium and it fit as expected."
2.0,I was do excited to open my box...to find only 4 pairs not 12 and one single that did not have a match. Of the 4 pairs I had 1 is broken.  I will give a new review when and if this is fixed.
2.0,Stones feel light and fake. These plugs are really tiny. They also have a very minimal flare. I returned them
2.0,"The shoes fit as expected and the lights worked for a while.  The right shoe stopped working after one week, the left shoe still works and randomly  has several different colors at one time.  Not a pair of shoes that will be used long term.  After six weeks lights no longer charge. Purchasing another well known brand for a few more dollars."
2.0,I wore it once and a crystal fell out :(
2.0,"thing is like black now.... should of read description better, oh well my loss, it was cute other wise =)"
2.0,Did not like the fact that the suits we received are  not to size and the suits are corduroy.  Not fleece. This was not in the description of the material.  Will be sending them back most likely.
2.0,Product is t<br />Bulky & ugly in my opinion the gem line was out of proportion and selves were way to short<br />Did get fast return if money once I sent sweater back
2.0,These are adorable however - my son got these as a gift on July 7- they are already almost ruined. We've had stride rite shoes last for months and months and look in way better condition than these shoes in 2 weeks. Such a bummer because my son absolutely loves them.
2.0,Small and not stretchy
2.0,I like the way the boxer briefs look and the style but they ride up my leg like a mofo. I’ve been pulling at these things all night. Makes it look like I got crabs or the itch’s.
2.0,"This is not t-shirt material, and it’s not the sport-type material. It’s something in between. I feel like this is going to fade as soon as it gets washed."
2.0,Great fabric and pattern. Way too small--like many sizes too small.
2.0,Got a large But the top is way way too small.pants ok but not top.ordered another I xlarge
2.0,I order two of these one for each daughter I went off of the size chart and one of the dresses I ordered was supposed to be 32inches instead it was 28 . the other was perfect !
2.0,So small. More for kids not adult. You guys should tell people this.
2.0,"While I loved this skirt, I ordered black and received what appears to be a very dark blue. If it isn't then it is a terrible black. The reason I know this is because my shirt is black for my uniform and they do not match at all. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Didnt fit good and was not cute on...maybe it is just my body, but this bikini was a NO GO for me personally."
2.0,Lettering is so incredibly tiny that it can barely be seen!
2.0,"The bottom was fitted, but the top was loose and out of shape. The material is thin"
2.0,I bought my normal size and couldn’t even get it on my foot.  Cheaply made and overall not a great shoe. I returned.
2.0,"I ordered these in both the size 10 and size 11, to make sure at least one of them fit my hubby. The ones that were too small I was going to give to my nephew, as he wears a size smaller. Well even the 11 is way too small for my husband. He normally wears a size 10 shoe, and he couldn't even get his foot all the way in the size 11.<br />I'm giving 2 stars only because I can't speak to the quality of the shoes, since they weren't able to be worn to see how they feel and hold up.<br />If review was based on fit only, it would be a -1."
2.0,They are a little too wide and i didnt like the material
2.0,"I got the large for my wife, but it was way too small. Obviously, this skirt is supposed to be short and sexy, but these sizes are much smaller than what you might be used to. With the velcro, the large can adjust to 28 to 34 inches, which is probably what most people would consider a Medium. But even more, this skirt looks so much sexier sitting on the hips, not on the waist... so you should take that into consideration. My wife is Brazilian and has some amazing hips (40&#34;), so we're going to try going up two sizes instead.<br /><br />Update: We got the XL and even that was too small. We returned it again and went with Avidlove [[ASIN:B013JGVHF8 Avidlove Women Role Play Mini Plaid Skirt Polyester Red Sexy Schoolgirl Lingerie Red (FBA) XL = US L]]"
2.0,"Fit is ok but very disappointed to find that the base color is navy blue, not black as shown in picture. First time wearing today and too late to return."
2.0,"the wording on manufacture and care tags is mispelled. bag was made in china. its not a soft leather, but does look great. could be faux leather.  a bit overpriced for the quality. quality is can only be measured over time—-how long before the zipper breaks? how long before the gold plating loses its plating...it still looks good though."
2.0,"I read reviews, it should have fit my 5ft 8&#34; inches based on what others wrote but it didn't even reach my ankles.  I suppose this is a quality control issue I returned it."
2.0,"I ordered a size up to stretch to 1/2"" but they were way too small."
2.0,"The necklace pendant is nice and the wearer loves it; however, the necklace part broke the same night it was given and needed to be replaced with a chain in order to wear the pendant jewelry. The necklace material popped out of the connecting metal latch which could have been devastating at the purity event, if it was lost with all the guests still present."
2.0,I bought these thinking how much I couldn't wait to wear them then received them just to see they aren't possible to wear!! The front weight makes them pop right out! I lost one down the drain immediately because I forgot they aren't screw on and the second the water hit them they slipped right out!! So now I can't even return them because I lost one !
2.0,Lenses cloudy.
2.0,The watch I received did not illuminate in the dark. Disappointed.
2.0,These boots run a size too small… 2 stars because the style was attractive- but had to return.
2.0,I like the coat but the arms are to tight!!! I can't where it.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this sports bra, but the straps keep coming undone. Other than that, the fit is good and (when it's hooked) it is really comfortable. I'm not sure what movement loosens the strap hooks, but I end up basically wearing it as a halter sports bra until I can re-hook the straps. Maybe the angle isn't right on me  but I may end up just sewing it to make it non-adjustable."
2.0,"Overall it was a beautiful bra and the band size fit, but the problem was that the cup-size was too small."
2.0,"Like other buyers, my glasses arrived with scratches on both lenses.  Bummer."
2.0,My 9 month old is the size of a 12-18 month. This outfit &#34;fit&#34; him length wise but the way the outfit was pruportioned was so off the part that was supposed to be the pants hit way under his butt. Had to return.
2.0,"This was a great price, but you can tell it was cheaply made. It was very bulky and unflattering. Plus, the material did not look great and was not soft. I do not recommend."
2.0,Runs very small and for some reason it looked way better on model. Go figure.
2.0,The little ball won't screw on pops out easily the color itself is cute and it's a good product I bought the white one similar to this one and I'm just in love have gotten many compliments definitely is flashy love it 💯👌
2.0,"This dress is definitely VERY thin, but overall was cute. It also didn’t really want to stay in place, so I would recommend buying some fabric tape to keep everything in place."
2.0,I dont like that its so short it has that its long but it dont even go to the top of my pants not to happy about that
2.0,"For the cheap price, it wasn’t terrible...just not right for me. I think the part that was really a deal breaker is that the white top part is sheer. What are you supposed to do with that? Clearly this is meant to wear without a traditional bra (bc of the back design), and a sheer bodice means you have to figure out something to wear under there to be decent. Also I’m 5’9” and the short slip underneath barely covered my butt. As in, not a centimeter to spare, ladies. Given those two unfortunate circumstances, I still would have kept this as a beach cover up, but the slip is a polyester material that would be super uncomfortable if you’re damp or sweaty. Not an option to insert your own cotton lining because the zipper in the back is sewn into the slip lining, so it would be a huge pain to take the polyester lining out and insert your own cotton slip lining. Oh well. It was worth a shot, but I’m returning it."
2.0,Rubs off pretty easily after 48 hours drying time - now I have black marks on my stair carpet. Thanks.
2.0,"It's smelly and no matter how many times, the smell won't go away."
2.0,This dress looks better online that in actual view.
2.0,"I was expecting thick warm winter wool socks, instead I got thin possibly wool blended socks that may or may not last. Like the kind you wear with slacks. They are comfortable and light weight so will be good in early fall but DEFINITELY NOT for the frigid winter temps of Michigan."
2.0,Not happy with the quality of this shirt for that price.
2.0,"wasnt impressed with the quality. the buttons jingle like a cheap kids toy, and the button holes were already visibily falling apart upon reciept of the item. i ordered a size up and it was still small, so im pretty disappointed."
2.0,Me llego un par de de otro  tamaño y además con el lazo lleno de pegamento. Es decir un par llego mal
2.0,This looked as pictured and was too small! Not Satisfied with this purchase!! but will gift it to a friend.
2.0,It looks like oem but doesn't fit right on my older ps controller.
2.0,"My granddaughter loves this hoodie, used money she saved to buy it for herself, but after the first wash the stripes on the arms already started to fray. It looks shabby already. She’ll wear it because she’s a kid but I definitely don’t recommend it."
2.0,"Not sure if this is 500 pcs as you can just look at it and tell. I started counting and as I got to 200 there was very little left. These beads are dam near $15 and they are definitely nice beads however,  they had a bunch of scraps and coils that I probably won't be able to use which takes away even more from the amount. The stainless steel resembles almost like a dark gun metal or a blackish/silverish color. So if you're looking for a bright silver color,  this ain't it. It does however describe that in their description,  however I didn't think it would be that dark. I'm a little disappointed because this company has great products. I really wanted these beads to work. I will give any update if they reach out with a solution but in the meantime I'm returning because I'm not happy #sadcustomer"
2.0,Looks like a twelve year old made it for their best friend...
2.0,I thought this was a one piece shawl with a tie. It is two separate wings. The way it stays on is with a velcro adjustable elastic collar that wraps around your neck. I found it very uncomfortable.
2.0,They changed colors too quick! I had to replace a few bracelets. I would’ve returned them had I not used half before realizing it.
2.0,Love the these but they do run small!!
2.0,It was ok the  material was rough and little cheap. Wasn’t a bad product but not a good either.
2.0,"This is super cute, but unfortunately it didn’t last 2 days on my daughters hand."
2.0,I ordered an xl like i always do.  I can't even get it around my waist and chest.  Size is definitely off and the dress is adorable.  Disappointed
2.0,"Walking, exercising, housekeeping."
2.0,"A few months ago I had purchased a 47 hat of which I loved the look and fit of so much. I bought this hat anticipating that same look and fit. This hat was nothing like the other 47 hat that I own. The material was very cheap and the fit was completely different. Rather than the LA logo standing up and facing forward when the hat was on my head; the material was so cheap and flimsy the logo basically just laid flat.  Overall, this hat just seemed very cheaply made."
2.0,Wear once or twice and get new...
2.0,Way too small and no stretch
2.0,I love the dress. I ordered creme. The tag shows creme bit it's evident that it's angel white. Very disappointing. I'll have to return it. This was needed for a particular event.
2.0,Shirt fit like a tent!!!
2.0,Black leggings are very see-thru! Would not recommend squatting.
2.0,"When I bought this, I thought the two circles would be seperate. They are actually glued to each other. It looks very tacky. The chain in awful quality, and it looks like you bought it for your four-year-old at a pawn shop. Don't waste your dollar on this."
2.0,"Pretty disappointed when getting this. Fits perfectly - chest, biceps, length, waistline...except the length of the arms. I’m 6ft 2in 215lbs bodybuilder - lean/cut. Sleeves should have come down all the way to the bottom/matching length of shirt itself. Even worse, I ordered the black one too and it’ll be here tomorrow. HOWEVER, I’m now using it as a rolled up shirt sleeve shirt."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, but they always grab my leg hair when walking. I don't plan to shave my legs for the sake of my shirt to look good."
2.0,"I gave two stars for the quality of the material and the suit appeared to be well made. The suit’s fit was boxy.  In the pictures the pants appeared to have a slim fit especially at the bottom. As you can see, they are anything but slim.  I don’t mind a wide legged pant, but give me what’s advertised. The suit was returned."
2.0,Pretty ring but not very comfortable.
2.0,"It looked horrible on, I have not worn it...."
2.0,"I liked how light and comfortable they are but what I don't like is the fact that they started coming apart about 3 weeks after I started using them which was only about 8 times.  As you can see from the pictures, the gloves from both hands are coming apart at the seams.  Clearly a manufacturing defect, but because I am outside of the 30 days, I cannot get them exchanged and there is no way to contact the company other than asking a question.  I am thoroughly disappointed with this product and will not buy them again."
2.0,i am a tall woman so i have to worry about the sleeves not bing long enough. i liked the shirt but the sleeves were slightly to short
2.0,"The cross itself is gorgeous but the chain, that darn chain. It was so easy to get knotted up and so aggravating to try and untangle, I didnt want to keep dealing wirh it, so I sent it back."
2.0,"The shirt is cute but while just trying it on, I discovered it had 2 small holes on it."
2.0,"Shirt fits ok, shorts have no give to them! Couldn’t wear them! They were really pretty.bummed I couldn’t wear them"
2.0,its not like a choker at all its very long and bad quality
2.0,"great slippers, but way too small....trying to navigate the return process!"
2.0,Quality is ok.. runs large
2.0,"Not really a fan of the material contents' smell. Out of the package they smell kind of chemical so i hand washed and air dried them. Sorry, i really don't care for them. I have lots of warm socks that do not have that chemical smell (i know that is a weird word to use in description .)"
2.0,"If you want the cardigan to fit like it does the model, order it a couple of sizes larger than your usual size. I wear small to medium,  and while the cardigan fits, it doesn't drape the way it does in the picture. Sleaves are shorter and so is the length.  I don't like how mine fits."
2.0,"I bought  a woman's size M, and when I opened them they where to small, they fit my 6 year old son."
2.0,It’s looks cheap.  I know you get what you pay for but I’m gonna have to send this one back.
2.0,I am 5'5 and 135 and ordered a size 6. Way too large in the front and butt area. It was more like a size 10. Way too long as well. The material was super heavy as well.. ended up taking them back..
2.0,This are huge and doesn't look like as the pictures at all!
2.0,These are cute but only have one strip of the rubber and slide off my head.
2.0,Looks different & you can barely make out what it’s supposed to be.
2.0,"This review is for the Halter Neck Pleated Front (backless) top. The material is thin (although soft) and the back is lower than a normal bra line (so even if you wanted to wear strapless, good luck). The drape in front is fine, but it's super tight. I bought an XL and it fit like a M—showed everything I was trying to conceal. Try the V-neck wrap-front halter tank instead. It's actually really flattering even with the elastic at the bottom, and it's true to size. The material smells terrible, and mine came with some frayed stitching, but those are minor complaints."
2.0,made well with quality materials.  But I ordered a large which was supposed to fit size 10-12.  I wear 11 1/2 and I couldn't get my feet into them.  My small footed brother-in-law now owns a new pair of slippers.
2.0,"These are pretty but one star has a damaged/ shorter arm (right earring in picture) not super noticeable, but not “new” condition."
2.0,5’9” 230lbs with broad shoulders - ordered XL - tight in the biceps and across the chess. Was like a mini skirt in length. Soft material.
2.0,It’s beautiful but didn’t close for me. I am a 34ddd
2.0,"Would be so cute if you’re small chested, adolescent girl even."
2.0,"I ordered a medium. I usually wear a small in shirts. The cut of the shirt was off, it was too tight around the shoulder and arm pit area and the rest of the top was rather loose. The quality of the material was ok, the color of the fabric was slightly darker than shown in the picture. I am returning the top."
2.0,"I bought these earrings with the intention of leaving them in for a few days and after a few times wearing them, both clasps turned this bronze color clearly being that the only part of these earrings that are sterling are the Harley dangles.  Thankfully I found a great website that sells clasps in REAL STERLING and I replaced them and now they look great.  I will never purchase MOD jewelry again, it's STAMPER Harley Davidson jewelry from now on."
2.0,"If only the nut was more proportionately matched to the cap, then this would have been a great product!  Delivery speed was great, packaging was good, quality of materials were good.  Just missed on design/assembly."
2.0,Small for size around hips
2.0,My son loved this bookbag at first. But after one month of use the one wheel is cracked and rattling. We want to exchange it. We had another Sierra bookbag and loved it.
2.0,My girls were super excited to get these cups to use for school. They are very hard to open and close for my preschooler and 1st grader so I have to leave them open and they leak everywhere. I really wanted them to work out because they are beautiful cups but it looks like I have to buy a different cup. If you expect your child to be able to open and close it yourself this is not the cup for you. It was hard for me!
2.0,"These are very cheap and light. However the loops don’t stay closed and i often look down to see my glasses (which are very light, eg maui jims) dangling from one loop. It seems a miracle that I haven’t lost any glasses yet. I cannot recommend these."
2.0,"these are really uncomfortable and, since you can't get your fingers into them, they look freakish and stiff. the joints are frozen and don't move. not worth the money, very disappointed."
2.0,Que no tienen la valvula.  No les volvere a comprar. Adios.
2.0,Leggings are great but they won’t stay up… It has a wide waistband but it doesn’t hold above your hips. All day I’m pulling them up
2.0,"Fabric is soft, but length is NOT as pictured. I ordered the correct size...it's just SHORT..falls to the waistline. Disappointing."
2.0,Ugly in real life. Never wore them.
2.0,The Centerstone is not all that it looks really fake but the rest of the ring is really nice
2.0,The cut has changed and the undershirts don't fit well anymore. I've been wearing these for years and recently noticed that they are shorter in length and shaped like a box. Cheaply made. I won't be buying these anymore
2.0,"Pretty enough for the price, but I am planning on returning this necklace for a few reasons. Turns out these are not true bezel-set stones. They are actually ""backless"" bezels - so the stone shows on both sides. This sounds good in theory, but the reality is that the back of the stones come to a point! They are sharp and really rather uncomfortable to wear. They also sometimes flip so that the sharp side is facing up (less sparkly and looks unusual when seen from closer distances). Also, the length of the one I got did not match the description. Less important, but maybe relevant, the pouch I received was white. The description advertises that the necklace comes in a blue or black velvet pouch. Lastly, this stainless steel is darker than some of the other stainless steel jewelry pieces I have in my collection. In my opinion that makes it look cheaper and doesn't look remotely like ""real"" jewelry."
2.0,So disappointed due to being a vortex optics fan but this shirt is way less quality than their optics. Shrinkage is real with this. Bought a 2x and if it shrinks anymore may be a good shirt for my 5 yr old son
2.0,"I am 5'6"" and 135 lbs and the small fit great. However, it looks like a dress you would wear to Easter Sunday. I was hoping for more of a flowy, summery dress that was more of a boho style. Maybe it was the way it fell on me, but it did not give me that feel. It made me feel like I was back in Sunday school. It could look better on the right person, but certainly not on me."
2.0,Cute but came broken. Very unfortunate
2.0,This was just like it is pictured in the ad but it was weird to wear? Not sure I will ever wear it. Save your money.
2.0,Graphics are poorly done and the shirt material is a little on the thin side.
2.0,The necklace comes in a little plastic bag inside a pouch. The pendent itself is okay. Looks decent especially from a distance. The chain is super short and kind of cheap. Mine has this weird kink in it that will not undue. Overall it’s nothing to rave about. Looks like something Id get from Walmart or Claire’s.
2.0,I ordered black. As you can see from the picture they are far from black lol.after my daughter only wearing them once the color faded on them tremendously. The picture is after her wearing them 3 times total. I was not satisfied at all but my 5yr old daughter actually loves them lol. She said they look like Moana shoes & the did in fact fit her well so it all ended up working out. Still wish I would have got the color I ordered though
2.0,Weird glare inside the lens - too distracting. I gave these away.
2.0,Ordered size 18-24 month for my 13 month old and I could not even get it on him it was so small and tight.
2.0,"Too short, they look silly."
2.0,I love the material but it doesn't fit like I expected. The neck area is huge so it makes the lace hang down and look weird.  Also took forever to ship! Not as satisfied as I thought I would be!
2.0,The earrings I received looked totally different than the ones pictured.  They are pretty enough but not al all what I wanted.
2.0,"Is a child's dress size<br />Dress is nice cute for thin 10,12 yr old."
2.0,"So I bought these in the midst of the pandemic when other options were either not available or too expensive, and, well, you get the runt of the litter you pay for. These gloves stick, even long after the box is open end they've had time to air out. That smell does transfer a bit to the food you prep. Also, they tear easily even just trying to get them out of the box. Realistically a box of 100 is probably more like a box of 70-80. They get the job done but there are now cheaper, better alternatives like Amex."
2.0,"The material is really really thin/inexpensive feeling. I wanted to send it back, but the seller could only send me another item, because it was so expensive to mail it to China. Unfortunately, it needs a lining or shape-wear to be worn. It is a little see through and clingy. It's a very pretty print, but the material doesn't do the body justice."
2.0,Had to return it. To big for smaller wrist
2.0,Bottoms were inexpensive enough but that's what you sacrifice in quality the pants must be washed when you first get them and still are not soft after two or three washes always bunches up around knees and is hard to get the pant legs down again sorry will not buy again
2.0,Icky fabric massive shoulders that look horrible on me
2.0,"Cool mask, great quality. But, like everyone else’s, showed up broken and warped so it won’t fit my face. Not sure if it’s the seller’s fault or Amazon, but yeah. Be aware. Otherwise, really cool!"
2.0,Material was inferior. Didn't appear durable than more than a few wears.
2.0,"It hurts. Wearing it tight as I like it, it hurts my neck bad. It leaves a big rash."
2.0,"Beautiful dress and nicely made but definitely not sized correctly for European women.  These are more Asian sizes.  Buyer beware, order up 8 sizes."
2.0,THE CLASP WAS SHAPED ODD FOR AN EARRING.  THE PRODUCT WAS PAINFUL FOR MY EARS.  THE PRODUCT WAS USED TO WEAR TO WORK.
2.0,Bought a 14/16 and it fits like a 12 in the tummy area.
2.0,This ring is sterling silver plated.  Not genuine sterling silver...  It did not turn my finger but the silver wore off the ring in a week.  I loved it when I got it but now very disappointed.  They should tell you it is plated and just say it's sterling silver.  Big difference.
2.0,I had to toss the strap and buy a leather strap.
2.0,"I love the convenience (and quiet) of these blenders, but be prepared to replace it a few times a year."
2.0,Not what we expected and it wasn’t comfortable for our baby.
2.0,"I tried this mask twice. As you can see in the picture, one looks pretty good, but it has a crack above the nose. The replacement sent was much worse, deformed and round. They are both waaaay too painful to actually wear. The mask literally crushes your face. It's a real shame because it's a beautiful mask otherwise. My 9-year-old is very disappointed since this was supposed to be his Halloween costume."
2.0,Product was much larger than I expected and was not as form fitting as in the picture.
2.0,They were EXCELLENT shoes while they lasted which was less than 3 months. I would not buy them again because I didn't even get a whole summer out of them. If the company were to address their longevity I would have bought them every year though I usually get at least two summers out of sandals.
2.0,They grip great I work unloading trucks for a postal company and the finger tips have already worn through didn't even make it three hours. They would be great for working on a car or yard work but not constant use.
2.0,Requires two hands to operate the clip.
2.0,"This is definitely not a true sweatshirt material if that's what you're expecting, it's more of a long sleeve thick shirt material, and a bit rough inside. It's not too bad if you wear a thin shirt underneath, however. Also it's a bit snug and not oversized like I wanted, but that's okay because I figured if I cut the bottom, it will look super cute cropped with high waisted jeans. I'm keeping it because it has potential, but the quality is not it!"
2.0,This is a warm hat and the fit is perfect. Only 2 stars though because the name tag was held on with hotglue and fell off almost immediately. Now there is very visible glue residue on the hat that won't come off.
2.0,One of the bands wouldn’t slide into my iwatch. The other slid in just fine. But never could get it on so I can’t use it. I bought it in another color too and it worked just fine.
2.0,They were adorable but the heel rubbed her heel and they were too stiff and hard .
2.0,"Globe was upside down on the axis, and binocular charm fell off pretty quickly after receiving the product. The chain also broke off ~1week later. Cute in photos, cheap as expected IRL."
2.0,This ankle bracelet is pretty but is very fine therefore probably fragile. I will be returning this bracelet.
2.0,This dress was way to short then expected. I had to return
2.0,"Disappointed. When I ordered them I was so excited that wanted to add an extra pair with blue lens. Arrived on time, but unfortunately after a couple of wears a leg broke. Good looking shades but quality does not hold description of product. I guess you get what you pay for, but still very disappointed!"
2.0,"I have gained weight, and I did not like the way it looked on me.  I sent it back.  Hopefully when I lose more weight I will order one again."
2.0,I have never been disappointed with a Amazon purchase untill today was so excited to receive this dress open it and saw the seams we're starting to come loose :( very disappointed but it is a beautiful dress and can easily be fixed. Just frustrated that I even have to take the time to fix something after receiving it
2.0,Ummm this dress doesn’t look like the dress on the model picture to me. The color seems more dull. The sequins look cheap. The back is cloth which make the dress a weird mix between casual and cocktail which I mean you can’t wear anywhere. Unfortunately I have to return it for those reasons.
2.0,They are very tight and pads are small. Wish I would have picked a larger size.
2.0,"I really was excited about this dress, that is until it was delivered. It is basically a T-shirt with a belt. Same material as a T shirt."
2.0,Low quality and not easy to use.
2.0,"This dress was too big and shapeless for me. It was a pretty color, but not a good fit. I had to return it."
2.0,"I like the stretch band -- makes it easy to put on and take off.  It was a little bit too tight but I was happy with it. But then band broke after a year.<br />I put on/take off a lot so i guess that stress the silicone too much.  If you only wear it occasionally, it will probably last a long time."
2.0,The words were not outlined in white. Very disappointed.
2.0,The necklace itself is cheaply made out of thread instead of leather or something more durable.
2.0,too small for airplane carry on.
2.0,i expected a bit better quality in the material
2.0,"It fit very well, the quality of the material is less than desirable. It does not breath at all. So if you wear this in the heat it’s going to get hot!"
2.0,The material is cheap. There is no shape to the shirt and the sleeves are short.
2.0,"Definitely order a size larger than your normal - post says fits as expected but then states below to size up which can be confusing.  But if you size up, it will fit as you would expect.  Fit is nice, elastic is comfortable, and good support.  Good colors too - even though it's a surprise as to what colors you'll get, I've been pleased with the mix I got. My only complaint is they tended to wear out in the crotch (consistently from pair to pair) sooner than my other brands<br />Update - Placed a new order since my first pairs were all wearing out. Package just arrived and surprised that (non) color and style are completely different than pictured (or what I got before). Fabric is lighter weight, just black and grey with no contrast piping, and a different cut. Arrived as two 2-packs not a 'variety four pack"" as advertised. Disappointed - will probably send back.  Guess it's a crap shoot as to what you will get since they obviously substituted a different product from what the post promotes"
2.0,It's not the nicest of things you can get and I would NOT recommend this for something as important as your wedding day...it's literally a costume accessory and if that is your purpose you'll be fine.
2.0,"Very cheaply made, very thin material.  Not at all what I expected from the picture."
2.0,Cute pattern. Very long in torso on pants and came with rip in the seam.
2.0,Feel like I'm wearing two left feet. The right foot is so off as it was made for a deformed foot
2.0,I purchased these charms for a project expecting to get a variety as in the description photo. I was not expecting to get 31 charms out of 150 to be Star Trek or Trekkie words. As a result I had to order charms from another vendor in order to finish my project. I chose not to return these as I had a deadline and needed to get as many done as quickly as possible. Otherwise the charms are a good size and not too heavy and the other charms will work for my project.
2.0,Loved the color. However the fabric at the seam ripped within a week of using. Not enough slots for cards either. Wouldn’t waste my money again.
2.0,Looks like the picture but is silky and very thin. Not something I would like to use in the kitchen.
2.0,"While it was a very cute dress, I ordered an extra small (I'm about 5'3, 110lbs) and this dress was HUGE on me. And much longer than I expected (past knees). Like mumu meets pajama dress. But it was soft and flowy...it would probably be cute when it fits."
2.0,Wore once and started falling apart.  Not the best... sorry.
2.0,A LOT SMALLER THAN WHAT THE PICTURE DEPICTED IT AS. NOT PLEASED WITH IT AT ALL.
2.0,Not very plush or padded as depicted in photo.
2.0,Loved the holder but with use it simply broke and is not fixable.
2.0,"This purse is not white, it is cream.  Also the purse is way too big.  I returned it."
2.0,The face of this watch is huge. unwearable
2.0,"Color is much darker than advertised, buckle is sticking out when latched. Would not buy it again!"
2.0,Not satisfied with the texture of the dress
2.0,"Love the pattern, love the fabric but the size is way off. XL is more like a medium/large."
2.0,The necklace broke
2.0,It took a month to get here I forgot about it.
2.0,"I wish I got to wear it more because it suits my style. But it made my finger bubble up, itchy, and red where the ring was sitting. Sad :("
2.0,Does not polish with ease. I have an old jewelers cloth to measure this new one against and this new one definitely has less polishing agent and thereby less polishing ability. Was hoping for a better product. I tried it on my silverware and my brassware and found it unacceptable.
2.0,Very pretty but the watch urned my wife's wrist green.
2.0,Quality not so good. Less than a month and most of the stones are  missing.
2.0,The pjs were very small for typical size medium & not real silky feeling. They were so cute in the pic.
2.0,"I bought this item for my husband, I gave it to him on his bday 8/22 and by 10/5, it broke.  the leather just fell apart as he was sitting on the couch."
2.0,Very Flimsy.
2.0,"Had a very hard time keeping these on my ears, its like they did not want to fit, now it could just be my ears. So I would not necessarily not buy these because of this review. Each person is different"
2.0,Love the item but one of the posts was a tad bit too thin so the earring back kept falling off. I replaced it with plastic tighter disc back but it fell off too and I lost 1 of the earrings.
2.0,I hoped being sketchers they would be more comfotable and supportive to walk in
2.0,"My husband thought the item was pretty, but it came SUPER dusty and doesn’t work. We’re going to try and replace the watch battery, but if that doesn’t fix the issue, it’s a POS."
2.0,This is the ugliest shirt I’ve ever seen. The colors are not even close to what is shown. The orange is like a traffic cone and the beige is diarrhea tan. It’s not a sweatshirt but a very heavy cotton. I gave it 2 stars bc it’s made well and is probably very comfortable. I ordered the large and it was so big my son asked if it was for my husband.
2.0,"I expected a sweater, but it was a lot thinner. It fit well when I ordered a size up, but it was short (to be fair, I'm 5'9&#34; & have a D-cup), and I was overall unimpressed."
2.0,Received products on time. I always wash my clothes before I wear them. Washed in cold and air dryer. Put the grey pair on first time and noticed the stitching in the crotch was already pulled and running. This is before they were ever worn!
2.0,We gave the entire water park a show because this is unlined and showed my daughters entire butt when wet. Thank goodness we got the older design where sonic is over the crotch or that would be see through too.
2.0,After a while it turned oxide so I can’t wear it anymore
2.0,Cross broke within a week. Chain is fine though
2.0,I have ordered over 15 pairs of leggings from leggings depot and I  love them. This particular pair was the same size I have ALWAYS ordered but was way too small and it didn't have the usual 'leggings depot tag on them' ! So I am awaiting a replacement pair and hopefully  these will be like my other over 15 pair leggings  that I  can give 5 stars!
2.0,"Mild compression. Cute sock!!  I am a plus size girl and have realized I should be wearing CL size compression. The Large they offer here seemed small. Overall though, it did help my foot swelling after a long day of work!"
2.0,"There are a lot of counterfeit pins in this lot. Only one was found to be a genuine Disney pin. The selections were decent, but most of them had to be scrapped. I just wished the item description stated that they were copies and not original products."
2.0,no support whatsoever
2.0,Earring was bent when opened the package
2.0,NOT WHAT i EXPECTED HAD TO RETURN BECAUSE I GUESS THEY RUN TO SMALL. TO PRICY NOT WORTH THE PRICE.
2.0,Nothing is happening so there's nothing to really say about the four leaf clover
2.0,"Purchased 1 a year ago for my wife, it broke from taking it on and off. Purchased a second one after 6 months it broke again. Looks great just not a reliable product."
2.0,The cardigan in the photo is longer than the one I got. Mines come to my knees I'm 5'2
2.0,"Returned it. It's ok, flimsy.  If you're lob for something to get by for the night then it'll work. Up close you can see eggs the paint chips. It lacks lustre"
2.0,did not say that only 2 of the six were the hinged rings...what am I supposed to do with rings with no hinge???
2.0,"It is not like the photo. The fabric is harsh, and the fit does not exist.<br />It could have been cute in another fabric. Too big!"
2.0,"I don't like this bag as much as I thought I would. Sure, it's pretty, but no lining, no inside pockets. Kinda cheap really. I kept it anyway. 2 stars for pretty."
2.0,"Unless the quality has gone down sharply, I have the shoes these are modeled after and they are quite different. Stiff sides/back and cheap material for the soles. Spend the extra 15 and get a real pair.  They are fine since I got them just to use for work at a (mostly) sit down job, otherwise I would be more upset."
2.0,They arrived looking like the lens was moldy. Lot's of mold like spots on the lenses.  I wiped them with a lens wipe and the lenses sounded like they were going to come off.  The glasses are very flimsy. I guess I got what I paid for.
2.0,These didn't fit even though I ordered the right size. Cheap material too.
2.0,"This dress is not nearly as vibrant as the picture shows so I was really disappointed in that. It is made well and has a nice feel to it. Not heavy, but not thin or see through. I have not decided if I'm going to keep it, as of yet.  I am very pale and the top part of the dress has mostly the lighter purple bloom and it makes me look a bit washed out. If I pair it with a black cropped cardigan, it looks ok. It fits true to size, although it is too long. It will be the right length with platforms or heels. I am 5'1"" and size 34D. I do think it is a good purchase, but be aware that most likely it will be less bright and colorful as shown."
2.0,I loved the color bright yellow and they looked like you would be walking around on pure comfort. But this is not the case I wear a size 9 and my foot was filling out the flip-flop from heal to toe. The edges come up around the each foot which makes them even more snug to the foot. The slides would be perfect for pools or the beach but I do not recommend walking in them all day because they are not as comfy as other flip-flops.<br />I thought they were going to feel like walking on a cloud but they do not.
2.0,Don't fit as shown
2.0,Much lower quality than I expected... quite disappointed
2.0,"The coat is three times smaller than what I ordered,  the fur is nothing like the picture. Would return it but I would have to send it all the way to China at my cost. So now I'm stuck with a brand new coat that I can't wear!! :-("
2.0,"The material for one of the four I bought was completely different. I got them from the same listing, but this one feels like cheap, scratchy cotton. Another had deodorant marks on the inside. I'm horrified this was never checked after being returned by someone. Ewwwwwww!!! The others were fine but uuuuuuggggghhhhhhh I'm so disappointed with this company."
2.0,It’s a little body-conscious and the fabric doesn’t breathe so don’t wear it in the summer
2.0,"I am about 130 lbs and 5'7. I chose a small, and it was too short but also too loose. The bottom swooped out instead of hugging my rib cage. The material and color was nice, but I had to return since it was not what I was looking for, not what the display photo advertises."
2.0,A little bummed. This hat is very flimsy and small. Love the design but it doesn’t even fit on my head (pulled all the way on it goes like 2” above my eyebrows haha)
2.0,The gift was for my husband but the beanie was to small for him
2.0,"Super cute. But with in a couple weeks, my boyfriend's keychain broke. Just a little pissed."
2.0,The mesh lining is a little rough and scratchy. I would probably return but I already pulled off tag and washed thinking it works help.
2.0,"The little vail on the front is not that long, mine was only about 2 inches in length.<br />The picture that's shown must be on a child cause it doesn't fit like that at all.<br />Poorly constructed, but hey, it's not that expensive so why complain?"
2.0,Very thin material. Label was cut out. Length is short. I thought it was a smaller size than I ordered. I do want to return.
2.0,kinda dead of a color
2.0,This bag shows a bright vibrant purple and it is a very dark grape. Still a nice bag but scored low for the color.
2.0,The silver wore off the clasp very quickly leaving it a copper color and unwearable.
2.0,These shorts look really cute when they come out of the package but they look weird on the body. Pulls in weird spots. I don't have large hips orthods and it looked extremely baggy in the front and  snug in the waist. Not flattering.
2.0,"Sent back, a bit too snug and didn't care for the material. Loved the colors tho!"
2.0,"These just didn't work for me.  They were not flush with my skin, so there was an outline.  They also left sticky residue on my skin"
2.0,Fits fair except top runs small
2.0,Not flattering.  Received the wrong size. Ordered a med felt baggy  Ordered a sm. Still didn't fit right.  Inside was scratchy
2.0,"After using this product for than three months, almost half the hooks have snapped for no discernible reason. They weren’t overloaded with weight or anything else. They just broke and dropped my bags without warning. Not worth the money."
2.0,Not true to size fit much smaller than other brands of the same size. Order a larger size than u think you'll need
2.0,"I was looking for something more elastic, kind of a skull cap/beanie hybrid with a bit of memory and shape."
2.0,"I ended up returning these. They needed to be hemmed but were so thin we could not get a good mark on where. We were actually considering adding a slip to the inside since you could see right thru them.. And, the seamstress was worried about the sewing ripping the material.  Which is  a shame because they fit great otherwise!"
2.0,Poor quality. Won’t stay Velcroed. Slip off easy in sand.
2.0,"A great product for the price. I work construction and use it during work. The level is loud enough to drown out the surrounding area, but not to loud. Making calls is great.<br /><br />Edit: After about a month of use. It no longer holds charge. I have tried various chargers and it will no longer charge. So I’m changing my rating from 5 stars to two stars."
2.0,Cheaply made and cheap fabric!
2.0,Light weight. Cute fabric. Too small. Doesn’t cover my head well and slides off. Button placement uneven.
2.0,"Only using one time and hurt my feet badly, got a blister after jogging."
2.0,They are just really really cheap quality.....better off to spend an extra $20 on something that's better quality
2.0,Loved them but was disappointed retail price sticker on item said $10.00 I paid almost double !
2.0,"Would have been great, but only one side stayed attatched. I had to super glue it in place. At least now i know i wont fall off."
2.0,Fabric balls up after only a couple of washes.
2.0,"My kids wanted to give this to my wife for Mother's Day and when she opened it, the latch was broken. She could not use it. I will need to return it. I'm very disappointed. It looked very pretty. If had not come broken, it would've made a great gift from the kids."
2.0,"It fit fine until  I washed it in cold water, dryer on low. It is now too small to wear.  I am very dissatisfied since I can't wear it."
2.0,Weird fit and skirt is to full
2.0,"I was so excited to get this for my wife. The quality is nice, but the inside is white... so it's obvious when it picks up makeup or gets dirty. And the image is clear but too big. The bottom word is completely hidden as it covers under the chin.... bummer. Only kept it because I didn't think it was sanitary to send it back."
2.0,"Very thin, very large and not well shaped. I had to return it."
2.0,"My daughter was super stoked with the shirt when she initially got it.  The quality of the shirt fabric is excellent, but the print quality is terrible.  After one wash, the print started to crack and fade.  She is really bummed out and so am I considering the amount of money I paid for the shirt."
2.0,"Wouldn't have bought it if I had seen it in person.  Stiff, stinky and zipper sticks in one place. Style and size are as described in the product listing so no problem there - I just don't like the quality.  Not worth the cost and hassle to return but this was not a good purchase for me."
2.0,"Although the shirt does look like the picture, the description says it is 95% cotton but it is not. The material is see through and feels like an athletic spandex shirt."
2.0,"Not a great hat. Wish I looked at walmart first, can get basically the same hat for less than $5."
2.0,"Beautiful product, just not true to size."
2.0,these are still see through even though they are fleece
2.0,"I really like elastic watch bands because they’re comfortable and breathable. This one has weird, raised stitching creating the chevron pattern. I am afraid that the loops in the stitching will get caught and snag easily."
2.0,Had to return. The dress was WAY to long
2.0,"Not happy:(...my caps came in and it only had dark grey and light grey, the black was missing..I do love the caps though, I really needed black:(<br />Will I be able to get black sent to me?"
2.0,Low quality coat. The  zipper didn’t work properly on the first coat we received and there were loose strings coming off of it at the seams. We ordered up two sizes and it’s still two small. This coat uses Asian sizing more similar to what you see with Uniqlo.
2.0,"The belt's buckle is new and functional, however I had three problems.<br />1) The buckles on the belt are 1 3/4&#34; I tried to lace them through the loops on my Wrangler jeans and I had a hard time doing it.<br />2) I had thought that the belt was adjustable while being worn but it is not. The excess strap is under the belt and hard to get to and adjust. I'm slightly overweight and regular belts and even stretch braided belts give way after a while and my pants slide down. I had hoped that I could re-adjust this belt easily, but not possible.<br />3) because of my pants sliding down I had hoped the stretch part of the belt would help and I could tighten the belt more and benefit from the stretch, but there is very little stretch and no give.<br /><br />It would be worth the price if it worked for me, but it didn't"
2.0,"I bought this a year ago.  It looks good but that's all I can say for it.<br />One - when the umbrella is closed, the handle to open it is INSIDE the umbrella. You have to get your hands inside the closed umbrella & hold it open while opening it.  No other umbrellas are like this.<br />Two - Compared to my other umbrella with Sunbrella fabric, it doesn't do as much shade.<br />Three - the lights never worked - the sole purpose for buying this.<br />Four - the solar panel came off in a windstorm or was carried off by small animals, I have no idea.  So that' s unsafe to have exposed circuitry (none of my other solar lights have ever lost their panel).<br />Five - it's so heavy it falls over constantly - so if you do buy it, know that an ordinary patio umbrella stand is not strong enough.  You're going to need some serious weight."
2.0,"Ok shirt, runs a little small. Problem is, th top part of the tools is the same color as the shirt, so they are hard to see them."
2.0,Dress was super cute but it is very sheer. Not appropriate for school- I returned it.
2.0,Received this today and it’s a nice small wallet but I wish the flap was a little shorter. It makes the wallet a little awkward when you close it. My ids were a little hard to get in and out especially in the back window. Returning this tomorrow.
2.0,"The earrings are very cute.  But girls earrings, they are too big and she cannot wear them."
2.0,"This is the worst I have purchased on Amazon.<br />Size is very very small.  I m 5.2and 115lb. When I wear, get torn. My butt is not absolutely big. Never big. Delivery takes longer as other item."
2.0,"My sister loved it, but I was upset to find that though both the item photograph and description specify a snake chain, the charm arrived with a far flimsier linked chain. Didn't bother returning it because she liked it anyways, but i'm quite unhappy with the inaccuracy of the listing."
2.0,"The finish is OK, but these lenses do not come with a nose piece. This is significant because FACTORY OAKLEY NOSE PIECES (at least Gen 1 M frame nose pieces) DO NOT WORK WITH THIS PRODUCT. Now, this manufacturer never claims to provide a nose piece, but it also doesn't say that you can't use your Oakley factory ones. Most reasonable people would assume that an M-frame replacement would be compatible with M frame accessories."
2.0,Thin material and way too big
2.0,"Disappointed. Maybe a great scarf if you wanted a muted blue, red and brown scarf."
2.0,Was supposed to be for kids.  Way too long and magnetic connector seem really cheep.
2.0,"Less than one month after purchase, the plastic piece that rests on the nose fell off."
2.0,"I went up a size and it was still too small. It cut off the circulation around my arm pits even after going up a size. Was not comfortable, and the opening in the lower part so you can use the bathroom was very awkward and tight there also"
2.0,The seed pod/dandelion us very small. Half if the normal size.
2.0,it don't lite
2.0,"Although they technically work, and if I had never used any others, and had nothing to compare them to, I probably would have given a better rating. But I have used other brands which work WAY better. You have to twist this one more and it is just a much cheaper lesser quality than others that are out there. But ...it did work ....just not as well....more work efffort involved."
2.0,It’s not shiny enough to be a dress belt. The coating was factory defected. Stitching was too big. Returning it.
2.0,"Hiked in 17 degrees ℉ today. Was hoping these gloves would work for me, as they are supposed to be good to -30 ℉, Nope. Hands got very cold. Gloves were also extremely hard to put on, although they were the correct size. Interior liner shifts too much, making them a challenge to put on, particularly when they are needed in cold weather. Returned them, sadly."
2.0,Cute but way to short. Didn’t even cover my whole butt stopped half way. In other words I had to return it. If you are 5’2 and shorter this would work.
2.0,Was not as pictured. The red part was a washed out milky red. I sent them back.
2.0,Top of the dress is made from a cheap material. Poor made.
2.0,"I received the wand and the stick already had a bend in the plastic.  The toy is so cheap, it should have been $3.  My 2.5yo daughter loved to play with it, but I had to throw it out after she got another bend on the stick part (and she is not abusive with her toys).  Not impressed with the quality at all."
2.0,"This cape is way too short and is nearing shawl territory - to be fair I am a little taller than the average woman but at 5’8” I don’t think it should be that short on me. It is a very nice, high quality piece though so maybe it just needs a name change on the listing because it’s definitely not a cape 🤣 I do like that it’s connected at the neck so it stays on and in place but the length of the fabric there needs to be shorter as it’s an awkward and too long length and looks and feels odd on on your neck and upper chest."
2.0,Gave it a 2 star because the bras are super cute but the size I normally wear in these bras barely fit. No push up to speak of ladies! Got more overflow under my arms than cleavage! And I got a 34C... normally I'm on the tightest setting and could barely snap shut the loosest option on these! I won't order again because the whole purpose was push up and after reading the reviews I thought they'd be nice but turned out not like expected.
2.0,a lot more flimsy and cheaper than I hoped. looks much better in the picture.
2.0,The starfish bra piece was spaced WAY to far apart I had to cut them off and re sew them back on because they were going onto my daughters sides and not over her chest.
2.0,"Color was a awful blue and material was cheap looking! I never seen not one review before I bought this,they was all hidden, I refuse to buy anything now without reviews being shown!"
2.0,"As cute as this necklace is, the lights only worked for the first day.  Needless to say, it was never used on St. Patrick's day.  It's possible that the battery was faulty but we didn't have the time to buy new batteries for it so that it could be used his year....."
2.0,"Sandals started out good, but within 6 months the material felt insole on the left sandal started separating.<br />I have bought these same sandals originally at a local retail shoe repair Mom & Pops place. I fell in love with them. Lasted probably 5 years fully intact but obviously wearing out. Wanted no other brand but these. Saw them in Amazon a lot cheaper...Like $20 cheaper. But, as I mentioned before, improperly poor workmanship on their behalf.  I replaced them with Spenco's Men's Fusion 2 Slide Black(which are fully all made out of that rubbery material...very similar material you'd find in Crocks').. And let me tell you, feels like a glove, with phenomenal feet comfort. and a lot cheaper!"
2.0,Material not good wore one time looks like she had it forever linted up would never buy again
2.0,"way too short, otherwise feel great. just look terrible at ankle length. i'm 5 9. not THAT tall. make them longer!"
2.0,It portrays goddess yes but the arm bands doesn't fit in wrist nor upper arm (not sure what size these were meant for). The head band is cool but if I knew what to expect i probably would've crafted one myself. The leg bands are cool yes. Honestly I would have bought gladiator shoes myself.
2.0,Great idea poor result . Returned it.
2.0,I think you can find something cheaper
2.0,"They are beautiful, the only bad thing is that they are disposable because the fabric came off in the first use. Will not buy them again."
2.0,"I wanted to love these but after ordering two with the same problem i just can't :( They fit great but both pairs i ordered within 2 days of wearing the crotch area ripped and the seams just came off. I had this problem with the first pair i ordered so figure it may just be a faulty pair but the second pair did the same. I do not know if it is just the black pair, as the grey ones i got did not have this problem. If it was constructed a little better i could love these."
2.0,Small product didn’t fit
2.0,"The product is super cute but, it's leaking from the bears tail. It arrived in a package wet from the liquid.<br />The entire head is now empty"
2.0,Really wanted to like this dress but it has no shape. Fits loose and almost makes you look frumpy. Looks nothing like what the model is wearing.
2.0,"I didn't like the fact that I was expecting the pant to come with my order as listed on Amazon! Just a shirt, still waiting for a pants to show up...."
2.0,This was way too small. My boyfriend is a large in every other brand of underwear but this brand didn't fit at all.
2.0,Arrived fast. Before expected date. But it's way too small. Will fit an Asian. But not anyone who's 5&#34;10 145 lbs
2.0,Meh. Crappy metal that turns brown after wearing it. Did not feel beautiful having these on.
2.0,"Highly disappointed in the cut of the bottom half of the suit. It was very rigid about the thigh and groan area, that it made it impossible to wear."
2.0,Pretty shirt .It ran two sizes to small
2.0,"I bought these edgy earrings just as something fun/different to wear. I liked the black color and I wear a lot of black clothes.<br /><br />The set comes with 8 pairs which give me a nice variety to choose from. They have a shiny black finish.  They each came individually wrapped so I feel like that makes me feel confident they have been handled securely.  They vary in the way they close. 1 pair has a push on back , the barbell has a screw on back and the others have a snap type closure.<br /><br />So the not so good. I found these impossible to  put on because of the short ear wires and posts. The barbell earrings would not go in at all. The post earrings with the removable back would not fit at all.<br /><br />These are cute earrings but seven of the eight pairs would not go in my ear. Considering I can’t wear seven of the eight pairs, I cannot recommend these."
2.0,"Way too large, poorly cut, and cheaply made. I do not recommend buying."
2.0,"My daughter wanted this and I didn't expect it to last forever, but it came apart the first day"
2.0,Cute but made small
2.0,"Super cute. Although the actual alarm did not work, and we need a alarm clock"
2.0,"It's a good concept but not practical. It's gets heavy with just a cellphone in the pocket. I say heavy because You're wearing and carry your stuff around your neck. Also, the zippers are difficult to find and use, so you're fumbling with your scarf to find where the zippers are then where the tab to pull"
2.0,"I received the hoodie in a timely fashion. I was favorably impressed, however when I opened the package I was less impressed. It was on the smaller side . The zipper handle was on the left side which I find to be a nuisance. It was thinner than expected. I just can't recommend this product. I suggest customers stick to name brands even if it is more costly."
2.0,"The overall look of the earrings is nice, but the stones are very small.  Returned."
2.0,They were too fragile.
2.0,"Disappointing mostly because even though cut small, cheap elastic around the cheeks cause them to ride up during the day.  Not so bad as if wearing  a thong, &#34;I only guess&#34;, but annoying none-the-less. The waist band seems nice, but again their cut small. They are stylish looking though...I'm donating mine to the needy.<br />Chinese underpants... Just thought you should know"
2.0,"The bracelet is really pretty and it looks just like the alex and ani. However, it faded fast which was dissapointing. I wouldn't recommend it just because of that."
2.0,Belt slips on the cogs don't hold snug.
2.0,"Unfortunately after wearing it only one day, one of the receiving snap clasps pulled out from the band. I am very disappointed, it seemed a quality piece ."
2.0,"I'm giving this a mediocre  review because it took forever to come. In addition, the chain that holds the card holder is rusted. There is something  crusty on the metal  clip and it barely opens."
2.0,"Sizing did not match advertised specifications. As shipped, the XL seemed to be more of a US-XL , not CN-XL [ &#34; XL: flat measure 37cm,size fit waist 31, 32, 33 &#34; ]  Both waist and leg openings were much to large for a 33&#34; 155# body.  Also: Picture did not fully match: The accent stripes on the right hand side were missing.  A second suit, ordered at the same time from the same vendor in the same &#34;XL&#34; size but in the blue-camo pattern fit fine.  Go figure."
2.0,"Breaks in very fast and uneven, seems like it’s ready to collapse 1 week in."
2.0,Unfortunately the hat has stopped charging already. I got this for my husband for Christmas and it quit working already. Very disappointed. He loved them while it actually worked
2.0,It broke way too quick.<br />My son got sent home with it in a ziploc baggie about 5 days into wearing it.<br />Wouldn't buy this again.
2.0,I brought a large and I could have used extra lg they run small
2.0,I just felt the fabric was too thin to wear outside on a regular winter day. Nowadays even training joggers come with good insulated fabric. This was not it for me.
2.0,Not even sure if the Salvation Army will take it. Already in their bin.
2.0,The dress didn't fit around my chest.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, it fit so well, but the fabric was just too thin.  Would have made a great evening out if it wasn't for the fact that you could see everything underneath even without being in harsh lighting."
2.0,The socks look great but they run very small.  I am a 10.5 or 11 and these socks go a little higher than my ankle.  The quality of the material is good.  There's just not enough of it on your leg.
2.0,Cheaply made. Already falling apart a day after I got it.
2.0,I am not singing this for size though it’s definitely thicker then expected. Unfortunately that is the nature of measurements I still think 4 inches is 6 but I digress.  This item is crudely made and needs better refinement around the edges as it was ruff.  It also does not “snap” the air tag in place which means it basically will pop out.  If it’s intended purpose is to do exactly that (as it should) it failed on one of the two.  Simply put I could have just stuck the AirTag in my wallet and saved the money.
2.0,I ordered 0-3 most and received larger.
2.0,Never worn because they were too small and I threw the box away.  I ordered the small medium since all my clothing is small.  If you are small and have curves... order up or maybe this product isn’t for us.
2.0,"Two stars because the shirt is beautiful. Only two stars because the sizes are LAUGHABLY way way too small. I wear between and XL and XXL and I ordered the XXL because the other reviews said the sizes run small. What I received might be an XXL in child size. I'm not exaggerating, I'm guessing their sizes run a minimum of two sizes smaller than standard American sizes maybe even smaller than that. Not happy."
2.0,"They're cute, but they were already missing 3 jewels/sequences when I opened it."
2.0,yellowy white- not pure white
2.0,too big and sloppy
2.0,Too big on your face and am 51 yrs old everyone of them falls completely down waste of money
2.0,Hola recibi el product en tiempo..<br />Pero esa licuadora portalil ya esta usado poque se le ve en las tapaderas que estan rayadas.<br />Yo necesito que me lo remplacen por fabor.
2.0,"I ordered a size up but not needed. It was HUGE and just hung on me. Material was very heavy cotton, like 2x t-shirt thick, seemed like it would be hot. Returned due to fit."
2.0,tried to put it on and it broke. smh not ok.
2.0,It looks good but after a couple swim the sleeves ripped off. The material looks good but the stitches are not as strong to hold the sleeves...
2.0,Looked awesome and loved it. Until it was time to wash it.
2.0,"While I do like the chain, nice color and the chain itself seems durable, the clasp broke off within 6 weeks of only intermittent wear.  This is just past the return/exchange period, so I am stuck with it."
2.0,Not even 24 hours and it already has a huge hole in the seam.
2.0,The neckline trim and trim in general is not something that flatters me. It looks quite cheap and unfinished and I’ll probably never wear it again.
2.0,"Straps are too short, made for little people not full sized male adults"
2.0,"I have never left a two star review before, giving these two for quick delivery and pretty colors. It was just delivered and I called Amazon for return. The clasp is absolutely junk and ruins the whole appearance. It was advertised as having a lobster claw clasp, which would have made all the difference. Despite the low price I wouldn't wear it or gift it."
2.0,"The fit of this top is good, ok to decent support. However, the color blue is NOT anything like the photo. Instead of a beautiful, bright blue, it is actually an ugly dark dusty blue. I ordered this top in the brown as well which matched the picture a little bit more, however even the has the same funky &#34;dusty&#34; tinge to it. All and all, I love that Fanatasie is bringing back solid colors to their swim line...I over all the tacky prints."
2.0,The crown didn't fit onto the headband they send with it. It keeps popping off. It's basically worse than the dollar store ones. The necklace and bracelet ate decent.
2.0,"Plastic face shield is not exactly as depicted in the photo. It is cheap and flimsy and hard to see through. I purchased this product  because I am an educator and I wanted my students to see my facial expressions while I talked; however, the plastic is so bad that it bends light and people will get a very distorted view of your face. I actually don’t mind the openness, mainly because it allows you to breathe and talk more than a medical face shield. Hat is meh. I tried the shield with a different fitted cap and it was more sturdy/comfortable. Pretty disappointed and I wouldn’t recommend this overpriced product."
2.0,"This is a very cute style dress, and very flattering. However, it is not made with fabric that allows your body to cool itself. I’m actually cold by nature, but five minutes after putting this dress on, in 50 degree weather, I had sweat stains under my arms. It’s so hot in this dress, it’s really hard to wear it as a result."
2.0,Frame was very flimsy. Definately not an authentic Marc Jacobs as I also have Marc Jacobs sunglasses and they are much more sturdy.
2.0,Get what you pay for lol
2.0,"Not what I expected, will return for refund."
2.0,I ordered these and when I got them I put them on and the magnets weren't very strong the earrings would fall off easily. But they look great though if only the magnets were stronger.
2.0,They ripped within a few hours of wearing them! Not very good quality.
2.0,The color is more of a rust than in the picture.
2.0,It doesn't have the clip as shown in the picture. That was one of the reason I bought it.
2.0,Looks good but runs small I ordered a xl and usually wear a large and it was tight
2.0,"The photo doesn’t show you that there is this ruffly band around the waist that actually sticks up and curls outward around the rib cage, making the wearer appear to be wider than they are. I’m heavy enough without my clothing reminding me that I am and forcing me to look even wider."
2.0,"It's hard to get a newborn in it. Then when their in it the outfit swallows them and it's super hard to get them in the car seat with the outfit on. The 2 stars is for the feel of it, it's really soft."
2.0,"The bodysuit is adorable, however, my item was received without the headband."
2.0,"Cheaply made, Fell apart at the seams after only 1 month."
2.0,"The gems where was smaller than I expected and the rings are weirdly big. The ring was so big that the opening showed and it looked bad. But for only $10 and considering all it comes with, I suggest it for some people. Maybe it only looks bad on some noses?"
2.0,Nice Quality. would like to return for a medium
2.0,"I read some of the reviews but didnt take it to heart. The images for the skulls is way oversized for the face, its ridiculous. Love the thin material, but only works for people with glasses who can hold up the masks on their faces. Not very happy, but the galaxy ones still look cool."
2.0,"These are HUGE - overlap standard men's prescription eyeglasses by 25%. For this reason, I rarely use them."
2.0,"I just spent about 50 bucks buying the bracelet and earrings separately for Christmas, now to find out I could have got the whole 4 piece set from SmallDragon for under 20 dollars is just despicable! This combo was not linked when I made my purchases, yeah, I'm pissed."
2.0,"Just received two of these tops today. White top has a large makeup stain. Not very happy, will be returning."
2.0,I got this set to wear as bridesmaid jewelry. I found it to be kind of costume looking. I ended up giving it to one of my nieces instead. It looks great on her though!
2.0,Not good for a short torso
2.0,"I am 5-9 about 188lbs athletic build. I typically wear 33/34 waist and I purchased these shorts in size L according to the size chart. I intended to wear to the gym where I do HIIT and strength training. The shorts are very comfortable, but the length reached my knees and the crotch area was too deep as it interfered with some workouts (esp Kettlebell swings). Also the drawstring is incredibly stretchy (humorously so) and in order to tighten the shorts, so when you pull the stings to tighten and tie it, the bow is almost a footlong.<br /><br />I have since ordered a size M to see if these fit better in the length and crotch and will revisit this review after I get a chance to try them."
2.0,Moon bigger then I wanted.  Quality is OK for the price
2.0,Excelente quality on the product t and on the packaging
2.0,Very strong chemical smell and “stars” start felling off after 2 washes even I follow the instruction to hand wash / hang dry.
2.0,The first pair ( pink) is absolutely GOREGOUS but theses black ones look cheap.
2.0,"I ordered orange, but the color was a peach color. Also didn't care for the texture & material the blouse was made from. I ended up returning with no problems."
2.0,"Very Cheap imported quality, thin material.  It is one sided print as stated but Graphic print quality is not strong or vivid.<br />They are made in China and this information is not mentioned in description.<br />I use a lot of bandanas for work. FYI, my experience, I always found American made bandanas seem to hold the best quality and durability."
2.0,"Very nice, unfortunately the material is cheap and is all scratched the first day of use..."
2.0,Bought an XL and it's more like a small going on medium..
2.0,"I first bought this same band in stainless and liked it so well that I bought this one in PVD.  After sizing the first stainless one, I knew exactly where to cut this one.  The mesh is the same great quality as the first one, my issue with it is with the keeper latch on the clasp, it will not stay shut.  I should have checked this out before I cut the mesh to size it (didn't contact the vendor, I think its unreasonable to ask them to do anything since I already sized the band, which requires cutting the mesh).  The clasp itself seems to be of good quality (thick metal, not thin stamped), but the holes on the second lock latch don't line up with the little pins that hold it in position.  I tried just squeezing the sides a little to make it tighter but it doesn't really help since the holes don't line up.  Its frustrating to have the otherwise great band made unusable by the misalignment of this little keeper, I will probably end up just cutting it off and wear it without it. [[ASIN:B01GLWA7AS J.VANDER 22mm Brushed PVD Stainless Steel Shark Mesh Dive Watch Band Strap - Premium Clasp - Extra Long]]"
2.0,Fit in length but tight across mid foot.
2.0,"Not at all what I expected. Poor quality. Sending back. You can pay this same amount for truly stitched, better made jerseys."
2.0,"Pros:<br />- Affordable<br />- Cool concept<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The ""glow"" was barely noticeable<br />- Packaging was confusing (I prefer the pieces to specify what gauge they are)<br /><br />I must say that I'm disappointed. I don't know if I did them right but the glow wasn't present at all despite having them in light for a while. I tested by going to a completely dark bathroom with zero light around and I literally had to look up close to see the glow. Maybe it was just the ones I had or I didn't do it right but I'm not happy with them either way. Gave 2 stars because it was a good concept and still useful for stretching but I'd rather get regular colored tapers if the glow won't work."
2.0,"the drawing is short, it is not great as it is shown in the image, in addition to that the edges tend to curl inwards and that cuts even more what the drawing is, do not return it because I really needed it but I do not recommend it for the price  to buy it .... I would pay for it about 5 dollars and it is enough"
2.0,Way too small than expected and this was my usual size I order
2.0,"I'm short, so I wouldn't have thought this would be a problem, but the dress didn't start to flair out until after the start of my belly (my problem area) so it felt uncomfortable and was not flattering. Ended up returning it."
2.0,This necklace only cost a few dollars and seemed very cute and sturdy. With that being said I was only able to wear it for 20 min. or so before I could not tolerate it anymore. There are extremely sharp edges on a few places and left my chest red and cut up in a few places. What a shame because it really is a cute piece!
2.0,Runs very small by 2 sizes too small. I wear a 10/12 and ordered xl since it said fits 14/16 but gosh this fits more like a 6/8. The zipper kept sticking and white fur sheds everywhere. Itchy when on very cheaply made.
2.0,Fit fine was comfy I went to store came home and realized they were see through ugh<br /><br />They will show your undies. Would not recommend even with a thong.
2.0,Dose not stay up.
2.0,Shorter and smaller than I had expected. I thought it would be more of a pendant... not the case.  Also took a long time to ship... like a month! Worth the price... but wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it wasn't a pendant.
2.0,too large.  I need to learn not to purchase clothing on line---even when i already own clothing of the same manufacturer.  Nothing is true to size or consistent.
2.0,The apple is cute. It didn't last two days. Broke off the chain.
2.0,They hurt my ears and do not eliminate enough sound.
2.0,Runs small & is see through material
2.0,The pockets are white fabric and show when the vest is unzipped. They are not stitched down and they fold back.
2.0,"Clearly NOT leather as stated in the detailed description and for that would not buy again.  However, they are seemingly comfortable but I suspect will not last many outings due to them not being leather. Also,  I've never seen a shoe of any make... made anywhere over the globe... that didn't have a manufacturing tag or stamp inside the shoe indicating origin & size."
2.0,"falls on your face, too flimsy"
2.0,I wanted these to work so badly! The colors are great. They are very thin and stretchy- but the lace around the waist is not a stretchy material and the entire thing shimmies up underneath your clothing- I threw them away! Additionally is a bit awkward- it cut way too high under my armpits and irritated me. Total fail on my end
2.0,"It looks very good, and beautiful. But quality is not good, I think they are made in China"
2.0,The top is too small and the bottoms is too big
2.0,"I have another one of these from a different company and so assumed it would be the same material.  This material was really thin and not very stretchy or soft.  Very rayon like.....Sadly it did not work for me, I sent it back."
2.0,"Super super super tight.  Sizes must run small.  Unless you're a 12 year-old girl, there's no way the 10.5 mens will fit you.  It's a shame because otherwise it looks like a good shoe.  They should consider running wide sizes as well."
2.0,I got a medium. I’m 5’5” 140 lbs and this swallowed me. More like a large or xl. Not like in the picture... I thought it LOOKED cheap but I do think it’s well made.
2.0,"The spider earring broke on the first wear. I like the others, but the leather isn’t reinforced at all and they are easily broken"
2.0,not very durable but you get what you pay for
2.0,"While the dress is UBER KYOOT and different, it failed me. I had an event to attend that required uninterrupted white. The zipper became undone to the point of no return. THANK👏🏼THE 👏🏼LAWD👏🏼 I HAD👏🏼 A👏🏼 BACKUP👏🏼 WHITE 👏🏼DRESS!!!!!!!! I would’ve be TOTALLY screwed had I not had a backup. Regardless of how well it fits, I’m SO disappointed in the cheap zipper that I’m returning it. Not worth the efffort go have a new dress seen in."
2.0,I ordered a 2x and it fit like a 1x or smaller.
2.0,"These are the most uncomfortable tank tops i’ve ever worn. The back just feels awkward, i’m usually a size medium so that’s what i ordered and i’m a 34D and it’s just not comfortable at all. I prefer getting tank tops from target, for $8 and cropping them myself. The material is not stretchy or comfortable and just overall i wouldn’t buy these again nor would i recommend these to my friends."
2.0,These leggings are atleast two sizes smaller than labeled. The fabic seems nice and like they would not be see through.
2.0,Broke in a matter of days.
2.0,It's super cute! But looks really bulky in my ear :(
2.0,"First, the lace wasn't white, it was a sickly green white color, like it had been washed with something that color bleeds. The cut was all wonky and was far too small. And if you're a C cup or larger, it's going to be tight..."
2.0,Item was very small and thin.
2.0,Very low quality...like gumball machine quality. But they were cheap!
2.0,"Ordered a pair, received one anklet, what am I supposed to wear it on one foot?! I'm would have four stars, if I had received two, it's very pretty."
2.0,Received the wrong item. And the one I did receive had black scuff marks on front and back. Very disappointed.
2.0,This is so much cuter in the photos. The material and stitching are cheap. Once washed a few times material gets little balls on it. I would not purchase again.
2.0,the sleeve that slips into the wallet to hold windows in is not stiff so keeps slipping out.  would not purchase again.
2.0,The band it good. BUT the rough side of it is super scratchy!!!!!! I could hardly stand wearing it. The company selling it responded immediately and helped me with the issue.
2.0,"These are nice, soft & thin as I was hoping but the waist came up way too high & the size was way too big!  I'm a small girl but I like my close a bit loose so I always order a medium.  These were SO large I probably could/should have ordered an extra-small (don't think that was even a choice).<br /><br />  Regretful Buyer :("
2.0,"A bit tight. I'm a bigger guy and ordered a 3X. It fits ok, but is a bit tight in the torso. Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Costs too much for how tiny they are. I can wear them as earrings I guess.
2.0,"Was very disappointed in the size of this cross, it is very, very tiny even for a newborn."
2.0,"If your a curvy woman, itll be hard to get them on and keep them up. Definitely not meant for those of us with a bigger backside."
2.0,The color was supposed to be green but it looked more like mud. I returned this item.
2.0,"I bought these on a recommendation I'd read through a news website, but I have been disappointed. I love the look and design, but they are so loose that they just continually fall off your head."
2.0,Eh. I’m 5’2 and weigh 103. It’s cheaply made- but I’ll make it work!
2.0,This product runs very small. I gave mine away to a more petite friend.
2.0,It fits smaller than a normal xlaefw would.
2.0,"I received many extras with my purchase, a protective sleeve, a sun glass case, a cleaning cloth, a tiny screwdriver. The glasses were cute.  However, the quality was not so great, as I put my glasses into the fabric sleeve, one of the arms broke! I only had the glasses for a few weeks. I'm disappointed it didn't work out."
2.0,"They are ugly which I already knew when ordering them. I would order next size up, they run pretty small. Because they run small it makes the back of the shoe very uncomfortable. They are a bit clunky which makes them weird to walk in as well."
2.0,At first this wrist band was just like the Apple Brand but after wearing a few weeks the rubber started to wear at my skin. I wore it loose enough and took it off accordingly. In the picture I have switched to an old clothe band I had laying around.
2.0,Cheap materials. Will not lay flat.
2.0,"No Plastic Cover, and Smaller than descripted, opening is 1x2.5 .  Returning immediately.  Wal-Mart has full-size rubberized ones for a buck a piece with a plastic cover, and a black loop to match a black tag."
2.0,Too small in arms and girth.
2.0,"Very cheap fabric, rough and the elastic on the waste line is extremely bad (not good for running at all)"
2.0,I followed the size chart but these were still too small (tight and short). I returned them.
2.0,VERY DISAPPOINTED in quality would have returned but kept for my friends girls to play with .....stones have NO shine and metal is DULL
2.0,"Needed it for Polar Express Train, Christmas cheer and all that, hat quality poor."
2.0,"While I love the idea, and love the color... I feel that any REAL Chief who gave this a 5 star rating needs a good talking to in the Goatlocker. A US Navy Chief wears a gold, FOULED anchor!"
2.0,Not what i had expected
2.0,"The top is larger than advertised, while the lower portion is tighter than advertised. It's a very strange fitting garment that we actually had to cut down. I removed the top and made a nice skirt out of it, since it was, overall, too large, but that's really not appropriate for most people to have to do. For the money, you can do a lot better than a too-large top and too-small lower portion. I am average, as to measurements for my size, so this should have fit me perfectly, but it was larger than advertised and still so much larger on top than on the skirt portion. I have to say pass on this. Good luck in your search."
2.0,"The shoe fits but the top is extremely tight and actually cuts off circulation.  I have narrow feet so I am very surprised.  I wore them to work for 4 hours and when I took them off, I could barely walk because the top/front of my foot was numb."
2.0,"The green in the photo is a light, mint green.  What I received is a very dark green.  Not what I wanted at all."
2.0,"Not very shiny. Its black, but not really appropriate for black tie."
2.0,Not as picture. Thin and cheap looking
2.0,"I purchased this chain last year, I had worn it only twice and then it just fell off my neck. I was so disappointed. :(  It broke in two pieces.<br />It was my favorite chain, I wont buy this style again."
2.0,"Feels light and tinny, edges seem unfinished and rough. Very small size, fits very small wrists only. Too bad because the design is nice."
2.0,"This is meant to be a really cute skirt...BUT... a few things:<br />1. White is ULTRA see-through!!!! I imagine because of fabric etc...other colors might suffer from this as well!?<br />2.Hidden zippers are nice IF they're quality ones which are positioned at a good spot in the style...this one fails on both accounts...results....zipper bulges out when zipped up!<br />3. If you want it to look cute...leave it on the hanger only!!<br />Which are all unfortunate because I really wanted to love this skirt!!<br />If you find this review helpful, please give a thumbs up!<br />Thanks....happy shopping!"
2.0,I'm usually an xl-xxl. This is huge!
2.0,It’s ok for a very young girl
2.0,The fit was off and the material was cut to make hips look wider. Not flattering.
2.0,"As one other reviewer said, this is rose gold, which gives it a wonderfully trashy feel. The design is great and the stones are nice and sparkly, but who was the person who decided that gold would make this look too elegant?"
2.0,Pretty dress. Very short.
2.0,The zipper at the butt--- everytime you sit the zipper splits.  Terrible design flaw.
2.0,"If I do something that is easy or moderate like yoga these are alright and I like the way they look. However running over 5 miles in these, I start to get chafing below the armpit area. They are also thin material and seem low quality, I would not purchase again since I focus on long distance running (marathon distance and up) and they bother me too much."
2.0,"Not Good for me. Wanted sun glasses to fit over my eye glasses and these did not.<br />Did not wear them, so I can not evaluate."
2.0,The gold looks more silver so I returned the item soley on the color.
2.0,Heel lifts out of slipper while walking. Crocs provide better support.
2.0,"The dress was to thin in the fabric and to long in size , it didn't look right on ."
2.0,"Smells, coin section very hard to open.  Red leather color does not match the cloth liner red color and looks strange.  Also, shipping kept being delayed.  I should have just cancelled it."
2.0,"I bought it for my travel. There is no nose adjustment, so end up with light sneak in through. Find it quite annoying."
2.0,Incredibly attractive color but the back of the heel is too soft. So you can easily twist the foot.
2.0,"These looked good but were thick and scratchy, more than a real uniform. After one wash, they were unevenly faded and not at all softened. I don't recommend spending the money."
2.0,I think this was only meant to be a costume. It looked funny.
2.0,The magnet is not strong enough to hold
2.0,"Comfortable, but not very supportive. No aerobics or running in this. Maybe yoga. It all bounces. I wear a 36 DD so bought the XL. I think a molded cup who be better.<br /><br />Updated: I can honestly say that I HATE this bra. If you remotely have breasts larger than an A cup, don't bother. The bra caused any movement to become twice is much like they are double bouncing on a trampoline. It is embarrassing and uncomfortable to have so much movement even with just walking on a treadmill. Did I say already, I HATE THIS BRA?"
2.0,I love this necklace but it broke with in a week
2.0,"After having this bag for only a short time, and using it only twice, The seam above the back zipper compartment is already ripping apart.It is supposed to be a sturdy bag, but it isn't. I guess you get what you pay for, if it hadn't been so cheap, I would return it. Don't buy this bag unless all you intend to do with it is keep it on a shelf."
2.0,"Nice shoe, but too small and the next size would be too big so I returned them and was hit with a $4.99 return charge by the third party seller.  Maybe I'm spoiled by Amazon but a savvy third party seller would eat the return fees and make its customers happy."
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture  too thin not enough support for big boobs I'm a 40DD
2.0,This product was so dry and packed tight that we couldnt even break it up with an ice pick.  Who wants to use that on skin? The scent was like old lady cheap perfume.  Must be an outdated batch.  I returned the item for refund
2.0,Not made for a lot of hair.
2.0,"This wasn't as long as I'd hoped; maybe I'm a lot taller than the model? There was also discolored spot on the front and the back. You get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,Way too small. I ordered 2 sizes up and still couldn’t pull it across my chest let alone zip it.
2.0,"Was disappointed in the quality of the material.  Is more of a shiny.  Where the crossover is, you see it over the boob and is not attractive"
2.0,The Sweatshirt was made out of an uncomfortable material.
2.0,"The sizing chart attached to these sleeves was useless, as it pertained to shirt sizes. I took a guess based on my shirt size, but the sleeves were too short and too tight. I'd love to be able to order the correct size but don't want to take a chance on getting another pair that just needs to get sent back. Too bad, because it seems like just what I need."
2.0,Took forever to come and was cheaply made. I got this a while ago and mam was i disappointed. I was in season 3 of supernatural when I order this. It came when I was on season 10 and no longer watched the show.
2.0,"The back side was too heavy so it made my ear lobe turn up and then it just looked weird.  Too bad, I really liked the concept."
2.0,Reviews said to size up but I have found that not to be the case. Bought a 10 for my daughter and it was way too big. Quality isn’t great either but I suppose that’s what you would expect.
2.0,It's very cheap but thoughtful.
2.0,"I had hoped these would fit. I'm 6'1 and have large hands. They are just not made for large or long hands. Unfortunately, my dog chewed the mitten part off so I couldn't return them. One of them also had a strange red colored stain on it. (I ordered the off white ones). Super bummed."
2.0,"My daughter can wear a size medium in women’s. These arrived, and although there is a little stretch, the waist could fit my little six year old daughter. Cute skirts, but run very small."
2.0,"It fit a little large including the straps which could not be adjusted any further.  The bra does not separate the breast wel, perhaps because the cup is too large.  Consider ordering a little bit smaller with this bra."
2.0,"This product was both poorly designed and poorly manufactured.<br /><br />The top was poorly manufactured. The right pocket was sewn backwards so placing your right hand in the pocket requires you to bend your arm to point to your back. The left pocket was correctly oriented but was attached with a single thread.<br /><br />The pants were poorly designed. The drawstring was too short. When pulling on the pants one end of the drawstring invariably pulled into the waistband. I tried tying a knot, then two knots in the drawstring but the grommet was so large it still slipped into the waistband."
2.0,These definitely ran big and came so dented they won’t even wear them because they dig in so badly
2.0,The mitten part of the glove fell off very quickly.
2.0,"These pants were really soft and I really hoped that they would fit bc they were just what I was looking for! I'm 5'11"" and they were long enough but there was no way they were ever going to be able to zip. Sadly xxl was the largest size they offered. I wish they had larger sizes bc its so hard to find pants that are long enough and fit in the waist. I guess the hunt continues!"
2.0,"Soft at first but gets that scratchy feeling after a few weeks, I would not buy this again"
2.0,The shirt is a short shirt. The picture shows it's longer.
2.0,Broke within the first 24 hours :/
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, but as someone with a nose that has a high bridge, the rubber part around the nose is painfully uncomfortable from the moment you try these goggles on. I therefore cannot recommend them."
2.0,I had to really work to get them on which was off putting.
2.0,"Jewelry looked gorgeous and the colors were reflected as in image, however the necklace came bent on the front and the back of the earrings bent with the lightest handling. Sadly, these did not make for good gifts and we had to go out and buy from somewhere else. Wish the quality had been there, they did look cool."
2.0,"Loved this when I found it but the pin on the back comes off too easy, wear with caution"
2.0,"I wanted to love this top, as I'm always looking for shirts that I can wear with leggings (long enough to cover my bum). This tank just wasn't flattering whatsoever. It fit ok around my bust, but was HUGE from the armpits down. I'm very thin and I looked like I was trying to cover a baby bump. If it was a little more snug I think it would have worked."
2.0,"this product already broke, 3 weeks in...I was taking them off to talk on the cell, and the post fell off....I am a full grown adult who knows how to take care of my belongings .....not cool for a set of earrings that cost over $20..."
2.0,Don't like the fabric plus the size is larger than expected
2.0,I was wanting them to larger
2.0,"Total nonsense, very little heat if any"
2.0,the waist measurements were wrong. i bought the xxl thinking it would be a 38-41 inch waist but it was a 34. size up.
2.0,"Manufacturer recommended to go by its size chart rather than Amazon's. As a result, manufacturer's XXL was supposed to be the equivalent of Amazon's XXXL. Not so, and as result I wound up with shirts about 4&#34; too small.<br />The shirts themselves are of good quality and I would have enjoyed having them fit. Unfortunately, The manufacturer does not offer the larger size."
2.0,Cute. But it faded and smelled odd very quickly. This did not last long.
2.0,"5'3, 170lbs, too small. The stitching in the webbing doesn't stretch."
2.0,Material is not what I expected. Can not recommend.
2.0,"The ruffles look proportional on the little model with no chest, but on me (I have a large chest) I look more like a Shakespearean actor."
2.0,No es lo que eaperaba
2.0,The item had fairly good reviews so I was looking forward to it. It's light weight but the material feels and looks so cheap. There was a rose potpourri in the wallet and that smell was disgusting. It made me feel nauseous. I'm returning the item mostly because of the smell.
2.0,"I wish these would've fit me! I ordered an XL, which is my size, especially if they're baggy as advertised, but they came and were way too small. I'm not willing to purchase a 2X or 3X, so I returned them for a refund."
2.0,Returning the dress because the thread on the right sleeve was botched and coming unraveled. It gets 2 stars because I have to leave my house to return it. Defeats the purpose of ordering online.
2.0,"Bought this for my wife, and she loved the way it looked, but the wristband snapped after about a month. It seems reliable, except it's obviously not very well constructed."
2.0,THE EYE HOOK ON THE BUCKLE THAT ATTACHES TO THE BELT DOSEN'T HOLD
2.0,"I have Lady Hathaway tank tops that are very stretchy and mold to your body. These say cotton and have spandex, which should form fit better, they do NOT, it is not cotton. Very disappointed. Do not recommend and are a tad itchy as well even after washing."
2.0,I wore the ring 1 day and it turned my finger green.
2.0,"The shoe was cute and didn’t look overly cheap, h fortunately only one of the shoes lights up. Biggest bummer in the world to a three year old."
2.0,Cute design but you can't wash it without it shrinking.
2.0,this would have been a very comfortable bra if the cups were the actual size advertised. They use the same molded cups for every band size and if you are bigger than a full C you will still out the sides and bubble up with muffin boob overflow in the front.
2.0,Cheap material. And order your actual size. It looks baggy on me. Pockets are small and useless. And the breast pocket isn't even a pocket. The hood would cover a child's head fine but a adult it looks like a yakima.
2.0,"The fabric is terrible, the kind old lady pants are made of, very thick and cheap looking. I Ordered up a size after reading some reviews and got a large for my daughter, should have gotten a medium or small. She is 5'5 130 pounds and it is huge and baggy comes just above her knee. Also I thought it was white with purple and it is actually cream so It looks discolored or old. If you dont mind that type of fabric it is kinda cute just order your normal size, it doesn't look good baggy."
2.0,Beautiful top but unfortunately I had to return it because the top part was small. I’m a size 10 and ordered a M and couldn’t even get it on.
2.0,"I order two sweaters. One L and one XL. They were the same size. So I did a return hoping to get an actual XL, and it was still the same size as a L. In terms of size a large is as good as it gets. You won’t be swimming in it like the comments say, but it’s still baggy and fits nice around the hands. I am very disappointed about the sizing issue. I am keeping a second for back up but I still wish the XL was actually bigger than the L. Somehow they are the exact same size..."
2.0,"Very pretty, but it's already broken. Ive only had it a few months. Considering the price is not high, I would hope it would still last at last a year."
2.0,Bit large for the size. Waist is ok. But the length is 2x size larger
2.0,Too tiny. No hang and the “Virgo” is too small and barely readable. Even if the price was that good at around $3 it wasn’t worth it.
2.0,"Cute and the fit is as expected. Unfortunately, the toes are already wearing out with one use."
2.0,I ordered one and it was super small.  Ordered to sizes bigger and swear its the same size as last time.
2.0,"Bought this bag for my son when he got his first teaching job Feb 2019. By June, where the shoulder strap connects to the body of the bag has torn on both sides. I cant find anywhere to talk to seller."
2.0,bought 4 of these for my son. They all shrunk upon washing. I hung them to dry. DID NOT put in dryer but they still shrunk.
2.0,It’s fine. But the top just seems a little cheap and don’t love how it fits. Returning it
2.0,The swimsuit is too large at the bottom and small at the top.  The biggest complaint is that it is VERY difficult to put on!  The racer back style is nice but makes it very difficult to pull on.
2.0,THE DECORATION CAME OFF IN A FEW DAYS OF WEARING IT
2.0,"Loved the dress and the material.  Just beware, it's small. I were a 6 normally, bought a medium and it didnt fit. I had to return."
2.0,No lining in bottom and fits small
2.0,Pretty poorly made
2.0,I had a problem right out the gate.Just could not get my fingers on the crown to set. That important to me because i wear different watches so i need to reset often.Sent it right back so i dont know about the functions of the watch.
2.0,its looks good but its cheaply products and poor quality because when i wear it and its broken
2.0,"I was disappointed in these joggers. They were very short, more like capris. I had to return."
2.0,Do not care these shoes. Too wide at heel and middle. Too narrow across toes for me. Laces are elastic and not easily adjusted.
2.0,Quality was not that great!
2.0,The skirt was too long and it just looked really silly. I'm a short - maybe it might look good on someone with longer legs. Not for me.
2.0,Hurts :(
2.0,"Very pretty, but not wearable due to the large size. I would say this is about half the size of a drape tassel."
2.0,"The print is great, it was small around my arms but big everywhere else, I’m busty and the waist line didn’t hit me right"
2.0,It was very see through. Not squat proof. Great for upper body workouts only
2.0,"Contrary to the product description, this pendant came with a thin black cord that was much shorter than 30&#34; in length, the ends of the cord were left open/unfinished, and the pendant cannot be worn with the cord as a necklace as one would expect from the photo and product description. In short, the product description and photo were misleading and confusing. I returned the pendant because it cannot be worn on my neck!"
2.0,"These were too sheer for me and ran a tad small. Probably ok for a younger generation, but they didn’t work for me."
2.0,"Very cheap belt! Forgot to read the material it was made of, NO REAL Leather!  Also the cost to return it is more than it is worth, so I gave it to Goodwill!"
2.0,"I would just like to give a heads up that the fuschia pink sequined beret is bleeding. That shoulld be noted as it might cause stains on your skin and your clothing as well. I hope this gets fixed. I was a bit disappointed with that especially I don't want to have magenta stains on my forehead. It was also a bit small,  but perhaps in time it will loosen up, although I am afraid to use it because it stained my skin and my clothes."
2.0,The quality of these was lower than expected.
2.0,"The shirt was perfect. Soft and fit right. But the pants were a different material and not as soft, and about 2 sizes larger than the shirt. They were super baggy and several inches too long. I'm 5'4"", around 125-130 and ordered medium. I returned."
2.0,"Chains are cute and what I wanted, but they were so fragile. Two of them broke within minutes. Love the style If they would actually stay in tact."
2.0,The shoes are very pretty. Should advertise they run small; Even though it states US size. I am very disappointed.
2.0,They were too small!  Do you have a larger size than these!
2.0,"Not sure if this was authentic, but it was still nice and a good quality"
2.0,I was disappointed with this gown. It didn’t fit good and wasn’t as pretty as the picture
2.0,"I’m disappointed because I love the softness of Fair Indigo basics. However, since these are advertised as pajama shorts, and the reason for my buying them, I assumed they would be okay to sleep in. Unfortunately, after sleeping in them the first night, the middle part of the short (the crotch) sagged and left a big gap so that my thighs would rub together and I felt exposed (I wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing these outside in the garden after sleeping in them for fear of exposing too much to the neighbors). After washing them, they return to their original shape, but I’m not going to be washing them after each night of wear, as I bought these as an environmentally friendly alternative to other shorts. I think they do need a little bit of spandex to perform the way they are intended to. Bummed, Fair Indigo :("
2.0,"Same size as my other Coobies, but fit smaller."
2.0,"I like the fit and style, but it has a strong chemical odor I can seem to get rid of. I have washed it and Febrezed it and it still stinks. I have yet to wear it I will try leaving it out in the warm sun all day."
2.0,"Well made, but for me, they are too warm for most nights."
2.0,Usually huge fan of oxiuly dresses but this one wasn’t my favorite. The top is pretty see-through so i wore a slip underneath. The bottom fits well but the chest is a little tight. Really pretty pattern but dress seemed to be made cheaply
2.0,Again too small.
2.0,Too small. Made for a woman wrist
2.0,"This bracelet received only 2-stars from me because it has come apart.  It is a beautiful piece of jewelry and I wore it everyday.  In order to put the bracelet on, you have to stretch it over your hand.  (My hands and wrist are very small.)  Apparently, the stretchy material used to hold it together was not meant to last.  It began to fray leaving pieces of rubber material hanging out of the bracelet.  Eventually, the bracelet just came apart.  I now have a beautiful bracelet, in several pieces, that I can look at.  I didn't return the bracelet because it was only $13.00 and not worth the hassle of returning it.  (I guess you get what you pay for!)"
2.0,Soft fabric. Overall - just cheap pants with a printed logo. Overpriced.
2.0,"Gee, was so excited to receive the mask so I’d have a mask that is cooling to wear during long air travel trips or shifts at work. This is hotter than any other mask I’ve ever work…pretty, but miserable."
2.0,"I wouldn’t recommend. It looks better in the picture than in person. Looks very, very cheap."
2.0,"I found it ran really large. I was hoping for an oversized fit but I was swimming in it. And the snaps were really cheap, they jingled when you moved."
2.0,Not the best quality and color is totally different from what I ordered...
2.0,It appeared navy blue. It is smaller than  I expected.
2.0,"Crappy material. Nothing like fake leather, more like plastic. Too tacky to wear unless it is for a Halloween costume."
2.0,Suit is made well and fits as expected. Ample coverage for my 12 year old daughter. However it faded horribly after wearing one day to the beach and pool. I bought the lavender and it is now a pinkish color. I really like the fit so I might try a darker color for her and hopefully the fading won’t happen.
2.0,"I purchased this necklace for my son's girlfriend.  I do think it is very pretty.  After 3 weeks the Lords Prayer was barely visible. She thought perhaps that dirt had accumulated on the back of the lense.  She used a dry Qtip to try to clean it.  When she checked it after cleaning it the Lords Prayer was completely gone.  Apparently it is printed on the outside of the back of the lense.  This makes no sense and if the prayer is why you want the necklace, then order something else."
2.0,Foot slides around. The foot bed is fine but the top part/ strap that crosses over foot is loose and doesn’t secure feet.
2.0,"I have the  Lil Hipster in a print and love it. It's the perfect size and holds all I need, plus having the wallet as a zip case on the outside is very convenient. The reason for only two stars is that I was disappointed with the inside.  The pocket to hold currency had been stitched in half so was useless. I returned the bag.  I later found the same bag at a local Hallmark store and the currency pocket was not stitched down.  I am very happy with the color and the bag but wonder why the solid color costs so much more than the printed bags."
2.0,Fabric is poor quality. Not pleasant to touch or super comfy to wear<br />The idea is great. I love the show so I bought it.
2.0,I ordered my size 44/C and there was no way the cup size was a C.  It had to have been a double D. I was tired of returning bras so thankfully my daughter has a bigger chest as she was able to fit them.
2.0,No real support.  I wouldn't recommend them.
2.0,"Worked great initially but eventually the sprung part that hold the main ring fell apart. I only keep a fob, truck key and house key on it. Seemed sturdy initially. Just didn't last."
2.0,Did not fit as I expected. I returned it.
2.0,Thinking somebody else had this dress and it didn't fit them either cuz the button holes were stretched out and threads were everywhere. I got this dress a size bigger because of my chest but this fit really small. It's a really cute dress so I might exchange it and hope for the best
2.0,These are not sized right. I went by the guide and got an XL. They are too large for me and since it is underwear I can't return them Oh well I guess I have some silky rags now.
2.0,was not as pictured. some stones were not set properly and overall product looked cheap.
2.0,I ordered the red and black dress with the front zipper. I’m 5’4” and 140. The small fit great. I have a small chest and a big butt. The material was good for the price and I liked the design. But I’m returning this because there is a very noticeable buckle in the side seam on the left side of the dress at the hip. It would not lay flat at all.
2.0,"Ordered the black and white keychain. When it arrived, it was solid cream color with no black on it.  Doesn’t even come close to what’s pictured in the description. First Myra product I have been disappointed with."
2.0,The hat came all folded up in a small bag. I never could get the shape back right to look like the picture. I ended up wearing a different hat to the derby so I didn’t look like my hat needed ironing.
2.0,"Getting this product applied properly is no simple process.  Not for the faint of heart or non-detail oriented person.  I applied this to a new lens and followed the instructions.  However, it is really difficult to get this in the right position and even more difficult to get all of the wrinkles to lay down.  Once you have it looking good, it isn't quite as crystal clear as you would hope.  I eventually gave up and peeled it off.  I don't want those expensive ski goggle lenses scratched but even more, I didn't spend a lot of money on them just to reduce the clarity with a protector."
2.0,Beautiful but a stone popped out after the 1st wear
2.0,Very cute shoes but you get what you pay for. I've had them 4 days and the heels are already coming off.
2.0,Way to small. XL is more like a US small
2.0,the green lining inside cracked and peels away
2.0,Cute jeans... poorly constructed.. button broke off suspenders 1st time I wore them so I cut the straps off now they won’t stay up.. stretchy but runs big... I’m 5’4 135 and small was still a little baggy
2.0,This watch looked fine but it has an elastic band which meant no adjustment for my small wrist. I Returned.
2.0,"They are lovely slippers, but not comfortable at all. Generally Dearfoam are very comfy. These are a harder, sturdier slipper but not as soft as the original Dearfoams. They are well-made however."
2.0,"it so comfy and soft but i am a medium, so that is what i ordered and it came in WAYYYYYYYy too small"
2.0,"I didn't care for the item, personally. It was very large and not flattering on the ear. Pretty product, but not what I was expecting."
2.0,This is supposed to be mens XL. It came like a childs size. More like a 10-12 or small size 12 boys size.
2.0,"Looks great, but on the first wash the edges frayed."
2.0,"The large looked like a small infact it fit my niece perfectly and she wears a extra small, really cute shirt but did not fit."
2.0,"This is the fourth time I have bought these socks. The first 18 pairs were soft, warm, and a pleasure to wear. This iteration is totally different. First of all the size is inconsistent with the prior orders. They are too big for a woman’s size 6-9.<br />The fabric is totally different and feels quit synthetic. I was quite disappointed and will be returning them and seeking an alternative before winter. Not to say they are bad socks, they are not what I ordered and expected."
2.0,I bought these for my 3.5 year old son and they were way too tight. He didn't want to wear them at all. When i first opened them I thought I must have ordered Infant glasses but i rechecked and it says 3-10 yrs. There is no way these would fit a 5-6 yr old let alone a 10 yr old!
2.0,This is not worth the money.... It looks nothing like the pictures its fit is wonky! I was very mislead on this outfit. Now I have to take extra time to send it all back and await a refund and pray I get it all back.
2.0,"I read many of the reviews on this dress and with that in mind, I ordered a large. Too large for my chest (36c). I tried to imagine it fitting properly, so I could reorder, but I couldn't. I returned it and did not order another."
2.0,The sizing was WAY off. Size down 2 sizes
2.0,"I liked this holder. It looked really nice on my keyring, however....it broke after three months. The ring snagged on something in my pocket and when I pulled on it, the piece of material that holds it onto the medallion snapped off. So, I am trying a different holder that is one piece of leather."
2.0,"Laces appeared to be of good quality but had to be returned because I ordered 36&#34;, received laces labeled 36&#34; but we're actually 40&#34; which were too long for my needs."
2.0,"I got the small, the size and fit were just weird and not at all as expected. I wouldn’t buy this again"
2.0,"This is my second purcha see of this product, having bought the second after my first, a much loved oart of my jewelry collection) had broken after considerable wear.  This second one, recently received, was not of the same quality.  The &#34;stones&#34; were of equal quality, but the &#34;silver&#34; has obvious lumps and bumps in the finish which makes it look cheap.  I wore my other with many of my dress outfits and got many compliments.  This second, with it't defective finish on the silver portion, is quite obviously not up to the same quality."
2.0,I’m disappointed that the color is extremely lighter than the photo. I was wanting that brighter mint green and got a pastel mint. It fits true to size though. Just not as vibrant.
2.0,A Nice fabric but the first time i washed them .. hung dry .. the lace is coming off and falling apart on 2 outta 3 of them 😑
2.0,"Very cute maybe on a very thin or athletic person, but makes me look lumpy? It accentuates my belly 😭"
2.0,Cutie but made very cheap. But it will work for the outfit I have for a trip this summer.
2.0,Not prong set as listed & pictured. Disappointed. 2nd time to order and they are not the same. I specifically wanted prong set.
2.0,They are earrings and you get what you pay for. They are very cheap looking and not that great.
2.0,"I look like a farmers wife going to feed chickens said a family member I can't make this stuff up, the design is good but material is not flattering. I can't even give it away so there you have it"
2.0,"Way to small style was cut, but completely unable to wear due to improper sizing."
2.0,"The two mouth printed masks were a little off, which destroys the novelty illusion. Sally wasn't too bad, but Jack was not only way off but also upside down in relation to the nose strip on the mask. Other three masks looked okay, but the faces were a disappointment as those were the main reason I ordered them. If the other masks weren't still good I'd probably return these.<br /><br />There was also a pretty strong smell, but I'm thinking it'll come out in a wash or two."
2.0,"Great fun colors, about what I expected for the price. However, only a 2 star review bc I just received my order and 1 pair came in broken, in the package. I need all 3 pairs for an event tomorrow so I do not have the opportunity to return."
2.0,"These gloves are made well.. you can feel the insulation is as expected for winter gloves.. j<br /><br />I just opened the box and charged the batteries. I put the gloves on the high setting for 20 minutes in my house, room temperature, the fingers would heat up a bit and the back of my hand a bit more...this isn't good..<br /><br />So i went outside in 40° (American) weather for an hour, no activity to speak of, and it got worse.<br /><br />I'll be contacting the company for a refund."
2.0,It’s has a very pungent smell.
2.0,The body of the shirt fit fine but when I button up the sleeves....I can't. are my arms disproportionate to the rest of my body...this is my first time experiencing this so.....<br />There are lots of threads. Little time was spent making the product look finished.
2.0,"This scarf smelled like mold. I had to soak it in vinegar, wash it twice and dry it to get the stink out of it."
2.0,Doesn't last
2.0,the shirt fits small
2.0,The orange is quite different than advertised and the material is as well. It's very stiff.
2.0,How the heck are these supposed to be plus size?! I’m a size 6/8 US in jeans and these make me look like a stuffed sausage. It looks like I have a thigh muffin top. Really disappointed at how small these “plus sized” socks are
2.0,Fabric sags and is suoer clingy when wet :(
2.0,"Expected softer, clingy, flowy material, like in the picture. Material was stiff. It looks like a nurse's scrub top when I wear it."
2.0,"This is a nice wallet but what I received is a bifold with no flip ID section and it has less credit card slots than expected.<br /><br />The wallet is made very well out of a faux leather product in a nice tan color. And it supposedly has RFID blocking capabilities, although it's not marked on the box or with anything included with the wallet.<br /><br />There is one ID/driver's license slot and three credit card slots. There are also three larger slots between the two sides of the wallet - for receipts, tickets, or whatever.  There is also two SD card slots, one microSD. There are also two long slots for currency.<br /><br />The wallet is well sewn with reinforced corners. It has a substantial feel without being too bulky and actually feels like leather.<br /><br />So, all in all, a nice wallet, just not the one expected.<br /><br />NOTE:  I received this product in exchange for my honest review."
2.0,Runs huge the smallest size was still gigantic on me. Im a skinny woman . i had to return but It was a beautiful flow dress.
2.0,"I bought this watch due to my infatuation with technology and gadgets in general. I must say I was a little bit mislead with the description. I envisioned it in my head that the leds that would display the time would stay on rather than having to push a button to see the time. it's a novel watch, but for the price could use some improvement. it says it's water resistant but in the instructions say to not shower, submerge, or any other way introduce the watch to moisture, it even states to take the watch off when washing your hands. I'm in the medical field and that gets really annoying. so it's more of a once in a while going out type watch rather than one I wear on a daily basis."
2.0,WAy to big
2.0,"This does run very large. The material is also very weird. Its kind of silky, but is actually cheap material.<br /><br />I would not order again."
2.0,It is thinner that I expected and cheaply constructed.  One of the button holes was not completely stitched.
2.0,Poor quality. Design of lens causes dizziness. Another brand purchased on amazon with same concept much better
2.0,"It looked GREAT & wish I could have worn it, BUT..... Itś definitely not made for people with hair on their arms.... :( It pulled every hair it slid by and couldn't wear it not even a few minutes and had to take it off..... but other than that it was a good look! Just not made for hairy people!"
2.0,"I gave these glasses two stars, one for each lens. I can read through them just fine, even at distances I couldn't with my old glasses. However, that doesn't outweigh the outrageous length of time I waited for delivery or the fact that the hard plastic frames make my head hurt as much as my old glasses did. I will be looking for better glasses."
2.0,Good fit and quality. But I would recommend for an older population
2.0,For some reason the back of these are so sheer. The leg and thigh part are thicker material. I love the fit and style though...I’ll definitely be returning them.
2.0,Sizes run small in men fashion.
2.0,Very cute but cut so small..I wear a medium but ordered extra large..it's kinda tight..
2.0,I bought this because I loved the colors but I've returned them. I went by the size guides but they fit wayyy to loose on me. They also felt very cheaply made and the material was an odd texture. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"I bought this and received it well package. It looked very expensive for the price. I love how it looked, no complaints. So you may wondering why two stars well after wearing it the first time it stop working. I took it to a watch-smith and asked them to change battery. They checked the battery nothing wrong he put it back in and it was working. After a day it stop again. Went back to watch smith and he change the battery still not working. Disappointed as it still look new but it does not tell time."
2.0,"The band was very small, almost child sized. It could not fit my wrist and I have a thin wrist."
2.0,"Super see through, but the colors and fit are great!!"
2.0,This item was a problem in my bust area and hips. It was too tight and then too baggy just above that. Fabric was nice and lightweight.
2.0,"Fits ok, poorly made, strings hanging from everywhere unraveling. Had to hand sew to ensure would not unravel."
2.0,Chinese sizing so it runs very small. It was an awful polyester material that wasn't really tie dyed.  It's a print that looks like it is tie dyed.  Not very flattering.
2.0,I wish that I had read the reviews before putting it on my wish list. I can't lounge and watch TV in just my robe because it doesn't close completely.
2.0,These did not fit like the picture shown...they hug my ankles. I do like the fabric.
2.0,"I loved the heck out of this necklace, but sadly it tarnished quickly and broke shortly after it started tarnishing"
2.0,"Unfortunately, I didn't listen to the other reviews. The mask is cool, but I can't see through it at all. Not really a point to owning this if you can't wear it as a mask..."
2.0,Fits perfect the 1st time  In the waist. After the 1st where it stretches out. Fits perfect in the legs. Constantly have to pull them up due to stretching out at the waist.
2.0,IT'S THE SIZE OF A NICKEL! not what I expected.. giving to my 8 year old niece..
2.0,I ordered two pairs of the ifans Girls Unicorn shoes. My daughter normally wears a size 12 in shoes. After reading reviews I ordered one size up(size 13). The shoes arrived in perfect condition but to small for my daughter. I gifted the first pair to another little girl and ordered my daughter size 14(32). The shoes arrived damaged. I attached multiple photos trying to capture the damage. The shoes are adorable and would be 5 stars if seller packaged the product with more care. I did not attempt returning or exchanging the product.
2.0,I should have read the details better. I thought there would be an even number of tags and bracelets. Returned due to this.
2.0,Great while it last. Good for about 5-10 seats before broke
2.0,"Not quality but price would indicate that. Purchased to keep my 95 year old mother""s shoulders warm. Sufficient for my purpose but would recommend as a gift."
2.0,Broke pretty quick after purchase.
2.0,These shoes tore apart after 3 months. I would rather pay more for better quality. They looked so cute when we first purchased them.
2.0,The zipper was bent on arrival and I wore it 2-3 times before the zipper came completely off track!
2.0,Material not what I was expecting
2.0,"The body fit was perfect, but the sleeves were real long."
2.0,Shorts did not come finished or as pictured with the cute tassels on the end. Not as cute in person.
2.0,It broke after 2 weeks
2.0,Poor fit.  Length did not come up to knees.  Would not purchase again.
2.0,"Cute but too small (or smaller than i imagined).<br />the five stones together are only like 1.5 cm long so that when i put it on, instead of having a bling effect it just looked like I had a bumpy crescent moon in my cartilage.  Not very flattering."
2.0,They handle keeps coming loose the handle should be stronger and stay and put
2.0,Way to small and a weird shape
2.0,These run SUPER SMALL
2.0,Front of hat pokes up high bill seems a little long for me
2.0,Dress was suppose to be actual fit but the XL that I ordered was tight on the sleeves and hips. I will be returning for a larger size if available.
2.0,I love the coziness of the inside of the jacket but the zipper is to hard to zip and the size was completely wrong
2.0,"The necklace is cute, the bird is badly tarnished. Notified the seller and never heard a word. Take your chances."
2.0,It’s nice. Smaller diamonds on the wrist but it turned my wrist green
2.0,The design is cute but some of the  Stones chains are hanging poor quality jeans but they are cute.
2.0,"It looks nothing like the picture. It's looks as if the fabric absorb the paint and looks kinda faded, it does not look that sharp. It's also kinda tight."
2.0,"Very cute swimsuit, but the top was way too big (about 5+ inches too big) and the bottoms were a little snug around my thigh. I usually wear a 14/16 and ordered a XXXL. My bust is 38 DD waist 34 inches, hips 46 inches and 27 inches around my thigh where the bottoms go around. Disappointed because the cups were actually the perfect size to cover my chest."
2.0,"Enjoy having everything in one place. Easy to transfer from one bag to another. It is rather flimsy, however, I wish I had spent a little more money for a sturdier one. Constantly falls over in my purse. Hard to get to items except in middle compartment. Do NOT like that it collapses. I may just eat the loss and buy an NON-collapsible one, that's how much I do not like this one!"
2.0,We didn’t get the bracelet/wrist band that was supposed to be included
2.0,"The fit is perfect. However, the material reminds me of my grade school uniform. Disappointed, also, that the skirt is very flat, nowhere near the poof that's portrayed. Going to have to take it to a tailor to have something sewn in, or get a separate slip and hope it works. Also, the sash is way too long, going to have to get that fixed as well."
2.0,Disappointed.I recieved 2 separate pieces.one of the charms is completely different.It should be one bracelet all connected.I am in the process of returning it.
2.0,Poor quality anklet popped on first wear.
2.0,They keep turning green on stud. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"Loved the style and cut of this dress, however, the fabric was stiff, the V at the top rolled over and did not lay flat, I was disappointed. I would have gladly paid more for this dress for a better quality.  I will be returning."
2.0,My 8 year old doesn’t really have many books. This bag is sturdy but the zipper broke after only 3 weeks.
2.0,This shirt does run small. That wasn’t my problem since I knew that and ordered up in size. My problem was the material. I felt like I was wearing a curtain. Returned.
2.0,Runs smallp
2.0,"Very thin, even if touch screen. not good for winter cold weather.  Also very, very snug in the fingers, these gloves are for a child"
2.0,"Very thin, stitching loose. Not quality for much actual use."
2.0,Dont like the quality of fabric will return
2.0,While the print was lovely the stitching was rather poor. The piece I received looked like it’s going to tear any second. Needless to say I’ll be returning.
2.0,These were junk wont buy again the bottom moved around as I walked was very uncomfortable{ but the kept my feet warm } That was a plus I wore them out before winter was over. they actually had holes in them they were in the trash by Febuary. I would not recommend these.
2.0,Fabric is way too thin to wear this as a dress anywhere.
2.0,"It is hard for a toddler to use it as it is uncomfortable to wear, too tight in my opinion (not size wise, more design wise). My daughter refused to wear it."
2.0,"The glasses are too dark ... unless tis very bright and sunny, you will feel vision impaired (even during day if it is cloudy). Grading this product bad because of this oversight in design."
2.0,Too small<br /><br />casual use
2.0,"I followed the size chart provided in the pictures, and ordered a xxl (even though I'm typically an xl) This sweater runs SO large it's insane. I highly recommend sizing down 1-2 sizes. I could have definitely gotten a large and it still would have had that loose look like advertised. I will say that the quality seems good, and its comfortable on. However, this will have to be a sleep shirt for me."
2.0,"It plainly fits and holds pants in place.  But, the material of the belt is not elegant.  Expected more out of this belt considering its price range."
2.0,Mehhhh...
2.0,Broke very easily after wearing a few weeks
2.0,They were quite a bit bigger than I thought. And could not wear them like I wanted
2.0,"I find the material to be too stiff for a nightdress.  Also, the design has a line across mid/upper back with a small gather....not good thing to have on your back when sleeping."
2.0,The silver pinky is closed so the pieces don’t link. Not impressed.
2.0,"Super cool look, except I bought two pairs and they both ripped in the crotch area. It was after the 30 days and so I understand not a full refund. But just the fact that the second pair busted in broad daylight, really bad stitching and not reinforced."
2.0,I ordered a different color and it fit great. Ordered a different color and it feels completely different. Tight and not a lot of give in the material.
2.0,Poorly made. Rough eadges
2.0,The dress was slim fitting and not something you want to put on after being on the beach.  I had to return the item and maybe will be a large size.
2.0,"Maybe it's because I have a big booty, but the padding does not sit where you need it to sit if you're biking.  It would be perfect if I rode my bike sitting up like I was in a chair, but I'm not.  I lean forward.  These shorts don't help with that.  If they had more padding up front, they'd be perfect.<br /><br />I'm 5'8.5"", 165 pounds, athletic, and curvy, the medium fit great."
2.0,"Looked ok, until I washed it."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this. I had ordered an XL but it was much too large. So, I ordered the L and expected it to fit well. The arm holes are way too small and tight. The length was good, the waist and hip area and bust all fit well but it was super tight on my upper arms and felt very uncomfortable. My arms are of average size, so not sure if it was just a measurement mistake in the one I ordered, but I will be returning both of them."
2.0,"I purchased this sometime ago and finally got to use it. I Love the design;  However, after one  use the metal loops that holds the handles came apart. I tried gluing it but it did not help... So I have no choice but to park it. I must say I am very disappointed... That's why I gave it 2 stars..."
2.0,they didn't fit well at all - needed to return.
2.0,Even tho it said 4× it was not. It was to small.
2.0,Not sized for  a tall person.
2.0,Hard to get the clasp to stay on..
2.0,The suit was very small. It runs extremely small for the average American male.
2.0,"Cute but way too big for me.  Also, they didn’t stay in very well, like stud was too short or back was too big?"
2.0,"My major gripe with this item is that the ferules are too big to slide a pendant over.  My secondary gripe is that the necklace is coiled for shipping, and comes out of the box bent.  I did not find that it unbends easily.  The strands are quite shiny and look almost like plastic.  Also, they are quite short with a silver extension chain on the back.  This one will be returned."
2.0,Somewhat disappointed. Did not make any difference for night driving.
2.0,"Beautiful, but to small!!!"
2.0,"Was great for a few months, then the clasp broke off."
2.0,It looks good. But the golden color faded away after my first use. Thats why it's cheaper. Save your money.
2.0,Flexible plastic slips down and won’t hold in place.  Great if made from fabric with hooks
2.0,One of those items that the picture looked better than real product. Ended up being a lot thicker and rougher than expected. The scarf is an infinity scarf but being so think found it got on the way. The hoodie is much better size but again the knitting could have been done with thinner yarn. Will have a hard time using this product.
2.0,This was very soft but sleeves were too short. I wanted something to keep my arms warm while reading in bed. This was not the best for this purpose.
2.0,"Love the look of the sunglasses themselves, but they're not very durable. The arms of the glasses could definitely fit tighter. They were loose on me and a screw came out the first time I wore them, which caused the lense to not be supported. I never found the screw that went to the sunglasses, but I did fix them with a screw I already had.  The second time I wore them, after removing them from my sunglass case (they do not come with a case by the way), where they'd been protected, I realized another screw was missing, but I got lucky and recovered it from the case. I put the screw  back into the sunglasses and it has stayed so far. Will not order again, and might return these if I have any more problems."
2.0,Too light to protect the hands from cold even when driving<br />It shrinked after washing
2.0,Very poor quality returned it immediately.
2.0,"Advertised to work with Olympic bar but the first one I attempted to put on my xmark lumberjack snapped.  I'll be sending them back for a refund.<br /><br />Other than that, the construction was solid and professional.  The entire product is hard plastic and that is perhaps why it snapped so easily."
2.0,"This set is adorable! It’s a chunky knit gray kitty with ears on the hat and nose & whiskers on the neck and face warmer. When it arrived, my 9 year old daughter was dying to try it on, but it looked waaaay to small for her. The description says age 2-8 but she is just a few months into being 9 so I thought there was a possibility it would stretch to fit. Not a chance.<br />My very small for his age just turned 3 year old son wandered over to check it out and I could barely get the hat onto his head. The neck warmer was plenty big on him - almost too big and loose to really do any warming. The hat looks like it would be too deep for my 1 year old, like it could slide down over his whole face and head. I didn’t try it on him because he can’t stand hats of any kind.<br />So I’m not sure who this is for! The sizing is just really off, or my kids have huge heads (which from their pediatrician measurements and percentile charts isn’t the case).<br />Sorry to say since it is so cute, but I would steer clear of this one unless your child has a small head!"
2.0,I bought the chain and the bracelet and the bracelet has faded tremendously  because I wear more often than the chain. Don't waste your time and money and buy a better quality one. It would be money better spent.
2.0,Bracelet was delivered broken
2.0,"I loved the design of theshe socks but they were just way too small. I do not have a particularly wide calf, I would call my calf size average for an adult. These socks were so small I could not get them passed my ankle. My seven-year-old son  wears them on his skinny little chicken legs. They actually look like they were designed to fit a child!"
2.0,"These don't quite cover my entire arm when I wear a standard sized t-shirt, and I'm a petite woman with petite arms.<br />Be careful pulling them on, I heard a little bit of ripping when I put the 2nd sleeve on.<br /><br />I'm skeptical that these really block UV in a way that any other fabric wouldn't.  The science behind its UV blockage technology isn't explained, so I'm left to assume that there is none.  As we know, the clothes we wear everyday (unless they're specifically designed to block UV) do permit some UV to penetrate the fabric.<br /><br />The way that these sleeves keep you cooler is in the weave of the fabric which allows some air to reach your skin.  However, the weave likely also allows UV to reach your skin.  You also need to be moving (or in the way of a breeze) in order to benefit from this cooling strategy.  Sitting still with these on, they feel hot.  After all, it is a synthetic fabric, and it's not going to be as breathable as natural fibers permit.<br /><br />I thought of how to test these sleeves.  I could go out in the sun for 4 hours, wearing one sleeve, and compare my burned arm with what happens to the other arm.  I'm not willing to do that.  I might test this with some cyanotype plates, though--I'm thinking 3 plates (1 fully exposed, 1 with a similar weave of regular cotton & similar thread gauge covering it, and one covered with one of these sleeves.  I will update this review when I do."
2.0,Too small for a L
2.0,"Oddly shaped, bell bottoms uh, and too expensive! :("
2.0,"It's a fine dress, just know that there's not any structure, so if you need that, don't buy it.  It's just like drapey cloth"
2.0,Very narrow and not true to size. Buckle generically made and does not securely latch around the ankles accordingly.  Very sad to return these
2.0,"the material felt real cheap. the sowing was unraveling, not a good purchase"
2.0,This dress runs small.  I am a 14/16 and I should have ordered an XXL.  Waited too long to try it on for my grandaughter's tea party and can't return it now... :(
2.0,Was not very happy with how quick this product broke through the heel. I sunk into the grass in a matter of minutes. Wish it held better for the wedding I attended..
2.0,I did not like the color I prefer more gold look .
2.0,Too small .. wayyy too small
2.0,It sucks I thought it was 2 arm sleeves plural since it said sleeves and only got 1. The one has threads lose and popping out. The white of the area of the zipper looks cracked. Aside from that its good to wear but very disappointed that the title says arm SLEEVES plural but only get one. Not even worth the $7 or so i paid for it. Just don't false advertise with plural and hand out 1.
2.0,my glasses came broken i repaired them myself....love them
2.0,"6'1"" dude, 48"" jacket, usually US XL; tried 2XL, but chest fit like L, and NONE of the sizes have standard US-length sleeves, they are all 2/3-length like baseball shirt sleeves, so had to return.  Bummed because nobody else has this green shade of this fabric -- lightweight, floppy, cool."
2.0,very thin material and the back is just white. I don't love it
2.0,Very thin pants. Would be great for summer. Shows panty lines and any lumps you may have. Go up a size or two to be comfortable.
2.0,I really like this style legging but theses were a no go! Size is accurate I’m 5’2 128 and small was perfect. Not enough compression and usually in a seamless legging there is no camel tie but look out for theses!!
2.0,Great for the first few wears. After a few wears they start to fall off of your face which is unfortunate because they look amazing on. I wish they were made a little better 😭
2.0,Watch looks good but does not keep the time. It looses 15 minutes every 3 hours and about 3 hours every 24. It's worthless as a watch. I returned.
2.0,the size is too small and the material is see through!!
2.0,"Overall it’s a good mask but it was too cold in Vermont boarding and the cold air buses right through the mask and was burning my face from extreme cold so I was pretty disappointed in that aspect and then it completely froze rock solid when I got to the top of the mtn so like idek how that’s happening I would think this guard would be built to handle the cold like there.... smh , out of fairness to seller , the mask is good for small mountains in warmer areas but for places such as killington ,he’ll know way too cold sry but it’s the truth :/"
2.0,"It spacious but the handle is weak. It just broke off simply from hanging on wrist the third time using it, holding only credit cards."
2.0,The quality is great. The dress is very pretty. It is slim cut for a full figure sized dress. I ordered 1 size up and had to return it for 2 sizes larger than I normally wear.  It is worth the price once you find the right size.
2.0,They are cute but do not hold liners !
2.0,Construction is a bit awkward. Tight. Would not buy again
2.0,Cute shoes but way too big.
2.0,After a few uses 3 pairs broke
2.0,runs very small. I ordered a 3x.  it's more like a medium. shipped direct from china
2.0,skirt was huge like 4x too big and top did not close
2.0,"Runs small. I'm typically an xs, but these fit like an xxs."
2.0,Light doesn't come on unless you wave your hand right over it.  And it goes out before you can find what you're looking for.  too bad.  Great idea
2.0,it was smaller than expected. I loved the colors.
2.0,"It fit about 4 sizes too small, not even close"
2.0,"I got the large which is said to fit someone between 5'8-5'10. I'm only 5'6 and it was WAY too short, such a bummer. I really wanted this to work..."
2.0,"The fit was odd, so I returned it."
2.0,"The photo shows a VERY full skirt but the actual skirt is almost straight - looks very frumpy.  I'm 5'10"" and it was about 5"" too short - returning"
2.0,Bummed out that the balls to inflate the ears came packaged so terrible that they we’re deflated already and it’s hard to get the ears to pop up which is the whole point. The inside is very wide but very short
2.0,Thisnproductos run big
2.0,Colors bleed in the wash
2.0,"bought this as a gift for my Harry Potter loving niece.  She loved it, but it quickly broke :(<br />Not great quality."
2.0,"nice leather, hard to reverse belt from black to brown without tool to unsnap buckle"
2.0,"The dress I received is much larger on me than expected. I'm 5'1&#34;, 115 pounds and the small is very big and unflattering. It is also much longer than the dress in the photo. Bummer buy!"
2.0,No llega el modelo o el color que se pide
2.0,"My first issue is that it does not clip securely over the nose, the tension that holds it to the face is from the entire opening. That leaves the sides of the nose vunerable and open to air. The purpose of a mask is to filter air coming in. This does not fill that purpose. It is a fabric tube with a pouch to hold a filter, the filter won’t work with spaces on either side of the nose pulling in air. The one thing this can use is a flexible piece of something to secure it down over the bridge of the nose. Otherwise this is almost no different than cutting up a T-shirt, sewing it in a tube and making your kids wear it over their face. Otherwise the mask twists and turns and the filter ends up in the wrong place as well. Lucky to get two stars, and that’s for the cute fabrics, and the attempt to have a filter."
2.0,"I loved the bracelet and wore it for my wedding, but the next time I went to wear it, the goldtone had rubbed off and it looked tarnished.<br />I returned it."
2.0,"The black ones are a different material. Not as flexible and the fabric is kind of rough. I love these pants in the other colors because they are made out of great material and I use them for running, yoga, and HIIT classes. But the black ones are garbage, which is disappointing, because I would like to have some regular black workout pants."
2.0,"I am so disappointed in this dress because the print and cut is so beautiful, but the quality is just terrible.  Definitely not even worth the money I spent on it.  First, the dress is made of chiffon, and the top smocked part is lined, but the bottom part is not.  I had to rig something up for the bottom half because it would otherwise have been completely see-through.  Secondly, within minutes of wearing the dress, the hem at he back of the dress ripped.  I can sew, but since the material is chiffon, this will be no easy fix.  I bought it for family pictures and Mother's Day and got a lot of complements, but I'm going to end up putting a lot of work into fixing it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The seller offered me a full refund.  They were very cooperative and said that they had already begun to make the improvements needed."
2.0,I wanted to love this but two things kept me from that... 1- the top blue is a different color than the bottom blue- which to me would be funny if you wore it without the belt 2- I was hoping to be able to wear without the belt but it didn't look right
2.0,My niece likes it
2.0,Honestly it's a cool concept but fitting together is a bit difficult. Its not made of a real coin. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Definitely fits smaller than expected, I would order a size up if I were to buy again."
2.0,"The fabric was stiff, the size was too small for a man's face and it just wasn't as comfortable as the softer version from the same company. I'm not sure why the grey wasn't made out of the same fabric as the black and fusion masks."
2.0,I returned it because it turned my finger green with in one day.
2.0,"I received these earrings today and returned them right away. The wires are EXTREMELY thin and make them look cheap, nothing like in the picture. There is no weight to them at all. The Tanzanite gems are a decent size though. Still not worth $200."
2.0,Not bad but they are way too little
2.0,"It fits okay. Very thin and cheap fleece, it’s not plush or thick at all. The lettering is obviously ironed on and will probably fall off when washed. Not mad at the price but the quality isn’t great. Save your money is my advice!"
2.0,"Girls loved it, but its so small it wont last long.  Order a good 2 sizes up."
2.0,"I got this in a plus size (the 2x ) for my cousins Christmas gift, and there’s no way it’ll fit her.  It fits me perfectly. I normally where a medium-large.."
2.0,"not soft, not tight, moves on my feet in shoes and boots"
2.0,Very very small.. I’d suggest sizing 2 sizes up!!
2.0,"They are very cute fit myself and my daughter, I must have a small face. The only issue is the decals already started to peel off."
2.0,BEWARE I bought a Size 4 for big kids it fits  like a 2.5 or a 3.
2.0,Sweater stitching was extremely poor. The entire zipper and hood area was frayed. Returned immediately and bought a Hanes sweater.
2.0,"Ordered a size that should have been six inches too large on the waist and it was far too small. Labels in Chinese, sizing in Asian scale, and once again clearly made for Asian market, not US marketplace. Very disappointed. Be careful what you order and stick to products made for the American market."
2.0,The braclet fell of with in 20 minutes of wearing. Clasp is not secure and comes undone easily. I will take it to a jeweler maybe they can fix it.
2.0,When I first recvd these - I was in love!!!<br />After going through a double breast amputation and then DIEP Flap reconstruction surgery -<br />I have been unable to find any Bras that do not cause pain -<br /><br />At first - these were perfect BUT then after a few washes...<br />The band began to constantly roll up on me under my new breasts.<br />Which causes pain as it rubs on my incision sites and causes swelling in my upper abdomen from sitting on my ribs...<br /><br />Whish they fit as well as they did the 1st 2 weeks ....<br />I do love the no seams!! and the fabric is very very soft...
2.0,"It was too loose in my ear, kept rotating around and getting caught on everything, not surprised, but it was pretty!"
2.0,Poor contrast
2.0,"Very small pendant.  Wouldn't recommend, except for maybe a child."
2.0,This is not made for all women... super cute if I could have worn it without an extreme wedgy...
2.0,"This one doesn't deserved 2 stars either. Not good quality. I was so happy when I received this bag but after 2 weeks, the material that is covering the handle peeled off. No a real Tory Burch product. Beware! Thanks to Amazon for refunding my money."
2.0,The clip is very narrow.
2.0,It didn’t look quite right. More for the people that would just know. Otherwise you look like mrs. Clause
2.0,Brought ahead for a wedding and didn’t put them on till day of.  Way past returnable till date.  My fault.  I tried but only lasted 2 hours because of toe box.
2.0,"Runs very small. I consistently wear a women's large or a men's small. I got the men's small in this and it fit like a women's small! I couldn't even get it all the way up my arms! I might have fit into a men's large, but in addition to being very small, it was also shorter than I wanted and not knowing if the length would be longer on a larger size, I decided not to take the chance. The quality seemed good at first glance but since I sent back for bad fit, I can't say how it would wash or hold up. It might work if you are shorter and size up a couple of sizes. (I'm 5'10&#34;)"
2.0,"I bought these for my son. The description says it will fit a child/adult. However, when we got these they were extremely too big for my son. They fit my Father perfectly."
2.0,These shoes didn't stand up  very well. We didn't get much use out of them.
2.0,"Was so impressed when I received this tennis skirt, until putting it on, I realized that the sown in pocket was UPSIDE DOWN!!!"
2.0,"I'm giving it a 2 only because the keychain itself is not terribly made... However the black piece attached to the keychain with the emblem on it is not put on straight and the Buick Logo itself looks no where near as good as the photo. It is not stamped into the keychain, it is barely etched in and as one of the other reviews advised, the logo rubbed off in about a week for me."
2.0,The nose pieces were bent and the dg fell off the minute I took them out the plastic but I think I like it better without it
2.0,Looks like plastic rather than leather and the dark brown is not as dark as the picture.
2.0,Upon arrival both 'stones' were loose in the bag. Broken :(.  I can always glue them back on....it's pretty enough to keep
2.0,"I don't like the material. It is thin, clings to the body and has become rough on the sides where your hand reaches and touches your skirt. It looks old in 2-3 wears. Cheap material."
2.0,ithe material is a little too thin...from the photo it looked thicker..
2.0,"These socks are comfortable and wick well, but they do not last very long before getting holes in the toes. Other less expensive socks perform similarly with better durability."
2.0,it fit well except that the straps do not look anything like the ones in the picture. I had to fit them on my own.
2.0,Ordered correct size but this item fits snug and i recommend going up a size.
2.0,"Beautiful headband, unfortunately it hurt my 4 year old granddaughters head and she couldn't wear it. Appreciate the black padding on the band but it was still too tight. Tried what we could but she didn't wear it. Her head is a bit on the larger side, but she only turned 4."
2.0,Definitely nothing like the picture. Awful material. Fit like a joke. Awful. Returned immediately.
2.0,"Ok, to begin with I'd have to say the color is beautiful. I don't like the material it's made out of. Was disappointed with that. The top of the shirt is flattering and fits nice but after that it's way to full from the breast area down. Looks like a maternity shirt and is too long for me. Even if you wanted to hide a bit of a belly you can't because of the clingy material. Not happy."
2.0,"The gloves were perfect, however, they had a hole in them (on the outside of the right hand). I didn't have time to order a new pair, otherwise, i would have returned them."
2.0,"I’m a sucker for a good pun, especially on a baby’s onsie. Unfortunately, this fit way to small. I compared the 3-6 month size in this to the newborn size in Carter’s brand I still have, and there’s no significant difference. I recommend buying at least two sizes up if you want your little one to wear this more than once."
2.0,Way too small.  No where near a size 12 to 14
2.0,It's just two normal little bracelets. Nothing crazy or special. The metal kind of tarnishes but other than that it's nice. Although one of mine broke. And don't wear it in the shower or else you wont be able to get it off.
2.0,"Ok looking dress, but did not like it or the material.."
2.0,Not easy to put in and not comfortable.
2.0,"very heavy. Not a fan of it. When you're used to wearing the apple watch with standard apple bands and then you put this on, it just feels overbearing and clunky. I also do not have small wrists by any means and I needed to take links out."
2.0,Hated that they're heavy and also that the frames are much bigger than they come across visually I hate them
2.0,Not a great looking quality earring and quite small. It doesn't sparkle like a nice cut cubic zirconia does.
2.0,Broke about 3 months after purchase both speaker's are now cutting in and out and it has completely rest and was unable to turn it on until after I pulled out and put back in the battery
2.0,"If you're an honest 34, get a 36. I'm 34 and using the last loop. Returning. Leather is sub sub sub par. Buckle has a terrible finish. This belt should be about 8 bucks, seriously. Made in Hong Kong."
2.0,"This was described as a pack of 3, and you only get one. I wouldn’t have bought this if I knew I was only getting one; I needed three for a party."
2.0,Got about a month of use before the silicone just completely ripped where it attached to the watch. Now it’s worthless and unable to return :/ Save your $$ and find a different one!
2.0,I received my purchase
2.0,"the mesh looks like it will tear easily.  Runs small.  Purchased for my teen to use while on his motorcycle and it didn't fit him al all.  Husband tried it on, he is a Med, and he didn't like the fit either.  He said it fit more like a womens XL instead of a mens size.  We tried to return and missed the window."
2.0,"This sweater is lightweight and cozy comfy, however unless you want it fitted like a work blazer, order a size up for a more relaxed look.<br /><br />I am 5’3, 115 lbs and size 2.<br />This sweater in size small was a good mid thigh length but the sleeves were almost too short and the fit was off in basic areas.<br />Has pockets and tightly knitted, but the sizing dimensions are just a tad off and gives a sloppy and rather cheap look.<br />The fabric is your typical knitted fabric - soft and wintertime cozy. Nothing particularly special about it.<br />I’m definitely not going to throw this on when I want to look my best, but it’ll do for lounging around in."
2.0,The leggings are made of what seems to be a cheap material. They slide down when wearing and the leggings got a snag in them the first time I wore them.
2.0,"The fabric is hardly flexible and doesn't hug properly. I'm 5'5, 120 lbs, and a size 3 in most pants. Its hard to fasten at the bottom due to minimal stretch, but there's a big gap around my ribs. Also, this trainer is as long as my non-short torso waist trainer. I will be returning."
2.0,"It’s nice when it works, but it shuts off after 5 minutes. I have to unplug the power bank and re-plug it in for it to work again."
2.0,Not really compression socks. The material is very thin and stretches.
2.0,My wife won’t allow me out of the house in this vest. It looks cheap.
2.0,"Had to return. It was somewhat see through on top and it was short, came up to my ankles. Size is correct but length for me was too short. I'm 5'8"
2.0,The arms were too short
2.0,"The design is lovely, but it is seetrough and a little too small in the lenght. I will use it for the beach... A bit dissapointed"
2.0,Looks like a bobby  hat (British police) it is very hard felt. It just looks.. weird. Like a helmet
2.0,i am still waiting for this shop to replace 3 braclets that were not working and could not be fixed.  quality poor on magnets i have another one returned because magnets don't hold four out of the order uhappy
2.0,I liked this outfit but the top part hangs down past my daughter chest. She couldn’t wear it unless I had a shirt underneath. Good quality but it didn’t cover her top area as it should’ve
2.0,"Sunhat fell apart after one wear. Entire ""top"" of hat just detached from the brim. Disappointed, but I have still been wearing the brim alone and everyone thinks I am so fashion forward. LOL."
2.0,This is my second band of this kind. I had no problem with the first one.
2.0,This is a nice ring however turned my nose the rustic color so I can’t wear!
2.0,"I bought  6-7 size for a 4-year-old (37lb)  boy, but it's still a little tight to wear. The fabric is too rough for children. I had to return it."
2.0,Runs small in US children sizes. Cute shoe though. Easy return.
2.0,"You get what you pay, these glasses are very flimsey"
2.0,This fits my 11 year old.  Smells like jute.
2.0,"Not as cute in as in the pic. Not dressey enough for evening attire, perfect for a cruise outfit"
2.0,"I have ordered this same model Coach shoe several times in the past two years, and they were so comfortable, my favorite shoes. However, this pair was very squeaky, I could hear it walking down the hallway, and they rubbed my foot so raw on the first wear that I had to toss them out. Very disappointed!"
2.0,Pretty but wayyy to small
2.0,"I like the pattern but the material is a bit rough and when I washed it, it did get a bit softer, but about three inches on one of the legs came unstitched with just one washing."
2.0,"One of the masks says, “Taylor.” It is so odd. The material feels like cheap panties on your face. Very thin material. I gave these masks 2 stars because they are adjustable and the designs are cute. I will probably have to wear them over another mask for any protection.  Would not recommend."
2.0,"They are big, that's to be expected, as they go over glasses. I got these because of the reflective lenses, but u can see thru the lenses. Which means u can see the frame of the glasses underneath."
2.0,It came in a tank top style instead of having little Sleeves. I’m not gonna bother returning it but it’s not as the one shown in the picture
2.0,I take a size 8.5 for women and felt them constantly falling off. Ill fitting -I don't know how men can wear them...Never again
2.0,Very cute shoes. My daughter used them because she was in a wedding. After 1 day of use the glitter started coming off. Very disappointed.
2.0,"It's too tight. I was gonna wear it for jogging cause in my country we aren't allowed even to jog without a facemask. But the mouth area becomes very wet and quite appears quite prominent due to the colour, which is a bit embarrsaing."
2.0,"Socks are far too large! I ordered small women's. My shoe size is 6.5 US; these socks look like they are made for women's size 10-12. They feel like they're mostly lycra, not wool and are not very warm. Hoping they will be better after I wash them."
2.0,"I only purchased the dress because in the picture it was flowing and I liked the ASSEMETRICAL CUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRESS IN THE  WEBSITE PICTURE. HOWEVER, WHEN IT ARRIVED, THE BOTTOM OF THE DRESS WAS ONE EVEN CUT, IT WAS CUT SRAIGHT ACROSS THE BOTTOM, NOT THE ASSEMETRICAL FLOWING DESIGN DISPLAYED ON THE WEBSITE PICTURE,SO IT MADE IT LOOK LIKE A GRANDMA DRESS. THE DRESS WASN'T CUT AT THE BOTTOM LIKE THE PICTURE ON THE WEBSITE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRESS. OTHERWISE IT WOULD'VE BEEN A NICE DRESS. SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I'M NOT GONNA WEAR IT."
2.0,Poor quality. I refer to this fabric as disposable. Wear once throw away. No shape just hangs. Does not hold it's shape because of the fabric. Too bad loved the color. Returned it.
2.0,"Very pretty, but it’s see through and way too short and I’m 5’7”"
2.0,The  material was of poor quality.  I bagged it up to returned but mistook the bag as trash and threw it away on accident.  Anyhow that is probably where it belongs ...sorry for the bad review but I was very disappointed. I had great expectations. SAD FACE
2.0,Not correct sizing
2.0,Received it broken so I was very disappointed. I still gave it 2 stars because it's very cute and I want a replacement but not even sure how this happened if it doesn't look like the the ring holding it opened up it really looks like it was never connected.
2.0,después de un uso las telas comenzaron a ceder y se empezó a deshilachar
2.0,"The reverse side isn’t the same as the front. Disappointed, but keeping because can’t find any better. Won’t buy again, though."
2.0,Horrible fit bad material and no free returns
2.0,It's cute but 1-2 sizes smaller. The quality is ok considering it's a cheap price.
2.0,"There's not near enough fabric and there's way too much string, It does not stay in place at all, it just moves around and ends up being better to find another bikini or wear nothing at all."
2.0,I bought these and the H:oter Sportline Head Band and much prefer the latter though they cost more.  These work but begin to loose their shape after a few washings.  They are lighter weight and may be cooler and are significantly less expensive and may be preferred by some.  It is a matter of taste.
2.0,These are a hit and miss .. some of the earrings are so small they can barely hold up and get into your hole for placing the earring.
2.0,This dress is not very cute. My boyfriend said it looks good but it was pretty shapeless on me. You get what you pay for I guess
2.0,"They were good sunglasses, work as expected, and have a great look. My only complaint is that the plastic is cracking under the lenses. But, I guess they are $10 glasses, so what was I expecting?<br /><br />Edit: They have completely cracked at the lens, and the lens fell out. Contacted seller through e-mail and got no response. Beware when buying these."
2.0,"The material was too thin for me, I returned it."
2.0,"This shirt runs a little large but it is not too bad. The material feels like a good quality shirt, however,  it doesn't just tie around your neck. The strings go through two tiny holes in the back and then you tie. It is very awkward and hard to do bu yourself. It is really .ore trouble than it is worth. They should have put a button there."
2.0,Look good only online and not in person.
2.0,Felt like these were really unflattering. Returned them. They looked and felt incredibly comfortable though so wouldn’t be bad for lounging around the house.
2.0,"The fabric is very thin, tee shirt material.  The top is boxy and unflattering.  It is going back!!"
2.0,"the open mouth may have led some people to  think that it was  hinged, this is not the case, it was clear from the pictures that there was no hinged mechanism.  this dissapointed the recipient who is now looking forward to destroying the thing that was bought as  a base  for modification.  i did not promise my ""furry""  much, but they feel violated, and, the latex, smelled funny."
2.0,"Not what I expected,  but ok. Looks a lot cheaper when you see it person."
2.0,Love the design but started chipping off the day after I got it bad quality.
2.0,"I like the look of this top, but it cannot be worn without ironing, which is a drag for a cotton/spandex blend.  I am no fan of ironing, and frankly not that good at it. and this, being a stretchy material is difficult to iron. You get one area flat, and another gets creased. Very aggravating!"
2.0,"Not great quality , flimsey and ill fitting but they did the job. I probably would've been better off with the glow inthe dark fangs"
2.0,I ordered 2 sets at different times of the same product. Each time I ordered it I got a slightly different product. Unfortunately neither was very good at staying up. I would suggest against this and go with another product.
2.0,Not pleased with this. Keeps falling apart and whatever the clasps are made out of is extremely irritating to my skin.
2.0,"Not happy at all with his bracelet. It is beautiful, but<br />Poor quality. It doesn't stay tight and it's already starting to unravel and I have only had it for 5 days"
2.0,The polarization in these is minimal.
2.0,Don't think this was leather. Disappointed. Gave away.
2.0,I bought these for my daughter for her fitbit ace2 they fit perfectly but sadly can easily be broken when trying to put it on. my daughter now has 2 broken ones as the connection part is a thin flimsy piece of rubber-like material.
2.0,Fabric and lining was off did not like the fit wire and pad was off also
2.0,Cadena muy delgada!
2.0,"It looks cool, especially if you're in shape, but I wouldn't recommend it for its functionality.. Firstly, it's not warm at all, a slight breeze whips right through it. The pockets are also tiny and located closer to the armpits than the waist, giving the wearer a T-Rex affect when they try to walk with their hands in their pockets. The zippers on the pockets also grind up my hands that don't fit fully into the pocket. The double zipper on the inside is pretty much useless.<br /><br />I've had it for about a month and have had multiple compliments on its looks, I just wish it was warmer and had man sized pockets."
2.0,bought as Christmas present.  poor material; not like sweat shirt quality.
2.0,"The ring is massive, and I have big hands."
2.0,"I am a technician and bought these for my lockout locks to keep my key attached to my waist so I don't loose it when working while my lock is on a machine so my intended use is heavy duty. The loops at the end are not welded but are just a coil crimped. The coil itself on this is to weak for my use and the cord tangled with my other lock (I always have 2 locks on me). When the key was left to dangle this stretched longer than I would like. Also the ring I kept my key on started to stretch out already and the clip is thin.<br /><br />So these might be just fine for light use, but do not use them if your intended use is heavy."
2.0,The most unflattering outfit. The shorts just fit weird. Honestly it’s SO comfy.. unbelievably soft. But very unflattering
2.0,IT SAID REAL i THOUGHT it ment real 24kt. gold not diamond cut will be returning.
2.0,Not good. The chain was loose. It's a VERY thin (reveals EVERY lump and bump). The color is gorgeous and true to the pic. Order it if you have 0-3% bodyfat.
2.0,"The belt itself was great. however my gripe is that the loop that holds the extra belt strap easily falls off because there is nothing to prevent it from sliding off the belt. I lost it and was left with a foot of belt just hanging out awkwardly from my side. I suppose a quick fix would be to sew the loop onto the belt, but by the time I figured that out the loop was gone."
2.0,It was broke when I opened it
2.0,The lenses were broke when I received the glasses. Once I replaced them....the glasses were perfect. I have received many compliments on them.
2.0,"These seem to be of decent quality, but they do not fit original Oakley Razor Blades. They are several millimeters too short. The description should be more clear."
2.0,"I was so disappointed. The ad does not state size, and you need a magnifying glass to see the details on this."
2.0,"I love the print, and the colors, but the hem stitching caused it to roll. I don't care for that look at all."
2.0,Figure appears to have a crack in the cape. Company says that is the at it’s made
2.0,Be careful when you purchase the sizes run very small
2.0,Very beautiful product but some of the clasps are super low quality one clasp broke when I was trying to put it on the first time. A lot of them broke before even beating able to wear them and a few broke after a wear or two they are very cute but very low quality save your money unless you only need a one occasion necklace.
2.0,Long strap broke 3 days into using it
2.0,"When I received the glasses all that was marked on the box was UV400 Protection. When I checked with a polarized filter, they proved not to be as advertised."
2.0,Disappointing.  Fabric very thin and sizing completely out.  I purchased a size large which fits very snugly.  I usually wear a size 12 but this dress could fit a size 8 or 10.
2.0,It is a decent quality ring but the ends of the harshness come completely together once balls are on. Which I don't care for. I had hoped there would be some separation between them otherwise would have got a hoop.
2.0,It’s more comfortable than the plastic ones but it doesn’t stay on after 30 minutes
2.0,My 14 year old wanted this for cosplay. I believe these measurements we way off. She is only 5 foot. And the skirt length in the front looked as if she was wearing just a costume that was only the top. I told her she could not have worn it as a toddler.
2.0,Love the colors!! The metal is very thick so you can’t bend the earring so it’s hard to put on and take off.
2.0,Strap broke 1st time I wore it.<br /> My KN95 masks withstand taking 'off & on' daily without straps breaking. This was for use only on Sundays for singing.  Failed on first try.
2.0,"So the color and material are just fine, it definitely works as a headband. The problem is it isn't actually knotted in the front as it appears in the photo. It is just two separate bands. You can kind of twist them, but you don't get the knot effect."
2.0,"This is not cotton, so its not very breathable and is warmer than one might like a summer style gown to be. The size is as expected, not generous, so order up if you want a baggy nightshirt. The style is attractive."
2.0,"Most of my problems with this ring.  relate to its size.  The stones were slivers of color and as a result, there is little<br />to commend it."
2.0,you can see through the material as it is very thin; sent it back.  Too clingy and cheap looking.
2.0,"Bought a size 2, and the waist is way too big.  Everything else fits fine, except it definitely fits more like skinny jeans than straight fit.  I’m 5’2” and 120 lbs and am normally a size 2-3, so a 2 should not have been fit this poorly."
2.0,"These things stretch out so easily. I have normal sized calves, and they stretched out and started falling down after an hour of wear."
2.0,"It doesn't cuff around my ear at all, and as soon as I tried to put the backing on the post, it broke in two pieces."
2.0,"It's not as big as I thought it would be , very small. Chain fits good though and it is the quality  it advirtised just not a big or thick"
2.0,ripped instantly
2.0,The dress looked like it was made at home. It had threads hanging. It’s too long and is not shaped right. I have not washed it yet but I can imagine it will not holdup well. Sizing was ok. I’m a 2x. Five foot five inches . Will wear at home.
2.0,"The bottom portion fits (a bit snug but it's ok). The top portion is just awful. It's baggy on the underside and baggy on the top, and no matter hot hard I try, I can't tightly tie it around my neck or torso. It's going back."
2.0,"Very thin see through quality, pattern does not look like picture and is wrong colors, fits too big"
2.0,"This is so lightweight that I couldn’t imagine it lasting through a weekend. Very cheap lining and stitching. Not worth $15, but it is really cute. I’m returning."
2.0,Me mandaron talla smoll y pedí talla grande
2.0,"As other sellers noted, not the highest quality fabric (but that was to be expected based on the reviews). Unfortunately the problem was the fit--just awkward. Made my shoulders look way broader than they actually are. The grey color and print were mostly pretty, but there were some weird caramelly-brown sections to the flowers that didn't seem to fit with the rest.<br /><br />For what it's worth: I'm normally a size 12 (5'6&#34;, 170lbs, 36DD) and the large was a little big overall.<br /><br />Update: seller tried to coerce me into changing this review because it left a &#34;very bad impression&#34; and offered a refund only if I was willing to change my review. Thankfully it was fulfilled through prime so it has free returns anyway, but I might take other glowing reviews with a grain of salt."
2.0,"I loved this item straight out of the box - slim and very comfortable. HOWEVER, within 3 days of wearing it, the color started wearing off and now, a few weeks later, my band is two-toned...white where it rubs on anything and the color is still present where the band meets the watch. Would not recommend"
2.0,These pants are huge.  Grossly oversized and such wide legs that they are heavy and weigh you down.
2.0,Cute but thin and scratchy
2.0,I thought I couldn't go wrong with a simple cute shirt but does not look the same. The shirt is boxier if that makes sense. It's not flattering for a woman's body it fits more like a man's shirt. Needless to say I returned mine
2.0,"I could enjoy they for a month or so, they were cute. But awful quality"
2.0,Has anyone noticed the color bleeding from the shirt when sweating a lot? Or did I get a faulty batch?
2.0,Way too big for a child’s head! It’s too big even for my head. We’re putting a hat on and then putting the antlers on. It works
2.0,Like the look but the skirt is see through if you need over and also I typically wear a large and this skirt was huge on me.. I wish I would have ordered a medium
2.0,It’s good but not for pollen protection
2.0,Very small made i ordered the biggest and it didn't fit extra large.
2.0,"I bought these as one of Amazon's &#34;add-on&#34; items for under $3. I thought it was a nice, spacious case for my glasses. On a trip, I needed a semi-hard case, so ordered this - it fit my needs nicely as it had a clip to use to hook onto my backpack. However, after using it for a day, the material attached to the clip came away and unraveled. Fortunately, I caught this occurring before losing my glasses, but the case is useless as a clip-<br />on item. Otherwise, it's perfectly fine as an eyeglasss case."
2.0,The end cap on the belt fell off almost immediately and 2 grommets have fallen out. It also wasn't true to size.
2.0,"This was packaged horribly.  It looked like a potato chip.  But after receiving a very small discount, I decided to keep it."
2.0,The hat itself was decent but it was missing the gold emblem on the top when it arrived
2.0,the sleeves went to my wrists which made the dress look really weird had to return it
2.0,Too skimpy - needs to be made with more material.  Elastic way too small as well.
2.0,Will fit my baby by The age of 3. Too large. I am not happy. Should be a regular tshirt for that size
2.0,"I have been on the hunt for a waterproof coat that will keep me warm on two trips to Europe this winter.  I ordered this coat and The Jump Down/Arctic Parka also from North Face.  I ultimately returned this coat because the other was far superior. This coat is heavy, boxy, and unflattering.  As others have said, the pockets are oddly placed and I felt like I didn’t know what to do with my hands.  The zippers are very sticky, and I fumbled with it for several minutes before I could even get the coat on.  I am 5’8 155lbs.  I wear a size medium in most brands, but always size up in North Face because I feel their clothing runs small and has little give.  The large felt oversized, but I am sure the medium would have been uncomfortably small around the shoulders.  Even with the drawstrings pulled to improve the shape, this one was not a winner for me.  Fortunately, the other coat is exactly what I was looking for."
2.0,It does say a 6 for small. I guess I need to go smaller. I'm between a 3 and 4.
2.0,material fine. Clasp keeps coming undone.
2.0,"Body suit fit great a little high on the thighs but some spand3shorties work well with it, however my gloves waste belt and stockings were a different green altogether"
2.0,"These are a cheap knock-off, but still fun & cute.  Be aware when it says “in stock”, they are not in stock in the USA, but China.  These will take months to arrive and not very well packed for shipping.  I’m upset they are are now a cheaper price than I paid."
2.0,"Unwearable. Bent brim that won't go flat, several wrinkles in the product. Basically useless. Wore it once because we were going to the races but it looked cheap. Go elsewhere for a nice hat."
2.0,Doesn't sit great when on
2.0,I love love the Asian style print on this which is why I ordered. Fit is not perfect but will do. I tried a small and medium and both the back under the bum flared out but then is slim at the hips and thighs from the front.  Kept the small.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:15b17344720358d2ffdd6f07176f5699]] Considerations:<br />-This chain isn’t going to fool anyone. It looks and feels cheap. You get what you pay for.<br />-This does not feel soft or comfortable on my neck and against my skin.<br />-I find the links to be larger than expected.<br />-The clasp is difficult to open and requires just the right angle to fit a link into.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-This might work well for costume jewelry and is a reasonable price.<br />-It comes in a blue box, complimenting the color."
2.0,Looks good and I like the material. The only problem was it was too small. I'm 5'9 200 pounds ( not fat).  Normally I wear large for regular fit and medium if I want to &#34;show off&#34; my arms. But the large one I got feels more like small.
2.0,Super thin and see through. Looks and feels cheap. The wide waist band just has one strip of elastic running through the top that is completely visible through the thin fabric.
2.0,Broke in shipment. Pretty though
2.0,I ordered the medium. The bottoms fit great but the top was way too small. So I ordered a large to see if I could get a top to match the bottoms and the top is still way too small. Not much of a difference between the medium and large. If you are bigger than a B cup I would not recommend getting this bathingsuit. I'm now stuck with two bathing suits that only the bottoms fit.
2.0,"Looks cheaply made, feels cheap and more of a grey them a walnut color. Very disappointed.<br /><br />It is comfortable, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."
2.0,"This is the  2nd top I bought from this seller. The first top was good, the fit was good, material was soft and nice. This top was made of very cheap material and was thin and was too tight and short in length. Very disappointed, was hoping to buy more items from the seller. But no more!"
2.0,"My husband has issues with swelling in one leg. I thought these would be easier for him get on then traditional compression socks. The zipper was a struggle and didn't save on time or energy. These maybe good for someone without swelling issues as a preventative, but not for someone with true pitting edema problems. The biggest issues he had was the zipper, it left an indentation in his leg.  I was concerned about skin breakdown issues where the zipper was pressing which is big issues for diabetics. Wounds = bad. We threw these out."
2.0,"The fit was as expected for the size.  I ordered a XXL being 5'10"" I wear a size 18 pant.  My ONLY complaint and the ONLY reason I'm returning it is because of the color. It was not at all close to the advertised pictures or even the other reviewers pictures. The purple is so muted it makes it look off."
2.0,I was disappointed that this was a plastic like material. It was completely synthetic like a child's Halloween costume. The diamond design was more like painted on then stitched in. I requested to return the product.
2.0,Broke easily after only a few wears.
2.0,"This was not at all what I expected.  It's much shorter than I thought and the material is very, very thin, which wouldn't be so bad but it's just odd fitting.  I love the look in the pictures, it's too bad it's not what it looks like.  Thanks."
2.0,It's ok.. not bent right so it looks weird
2.0,"If you are on the curvy side and looking for a cute, oversized fit, this is not it.  It’s soft, and not terrible quality.  But the fit is terrible and awkward.  The slits on the sides go up really high, so there are long flaps of fabric in the front and back.  The large was form fitting and made me look pregnant."
2.0,They were very uncomfortable.
2.0,"The fit of the actual dress was ok. The material is tee shirt, but the yucky too much polyester tee shirt feel.  The neckline both in front and back came up much, much, much higher than the pictures.  Based on the cut of the dress and how the pockets are sewn into the garment I received, the decorative string that is supposed to be in the back at the top of a vee was in the front instead of the back and there was no back vee whatsoever. If the pockets had not been sewn how they were, I would have thought maybe I had the dress on backwards. The neckline in back was cut straight across the back of my neck.  The front came up rather high too, not much lower than a tee shirt.  It's ok... I will wear it sometimes on summer days that arent too hot and humid as the fabric won't brethe muc but I am not at all in love with this dress and really regret ordering two differnt colors.  This will probably be dropped in the goodwill box."
2.0,"This went straight to the giveaway box.  No structure at all.  Sure, the cool sexy girl in the photos can pull it off, but how many of us walk around with our hands in our pockets to give it motion, and a Starbucks in our hand with long white-blonde hair flipping around our shoulders?  In real life this was cut very small, very thin fabric, everything just flopped around and the white detracted instead of added."
2.0,"Wanted to love these, they are really sweet and attractive. I can normally wear good costume jewelry with no problem but my ears became infected in less than 24 hours!!! If you have even  the slightest chance of reacting to ANY metal...DO NOT BUY !!!"
2.0,Great jacket but runs 2 size small
2.0,On the front of the cross it is an American flag when you touch it is really sharp I think that it needs to be a little fell down some so I won’t be so as sharp I would’ve gave this product for stars but I just couldn’t do it because of the sharpness of this necklace of the cross you could really scratch your finger
2.0,These are cute and the material is great. They’re too big for my face though.
2.0,"Super cute bag, but the pockets aren’t deep and upon unzipping each interior, found they were all split apart and wouldn’t re-zip. The seams of the straps and pulls aren’t finished, which makes the bag look cheap. I had a feeling it would be a hit or miss, based on reviews, and unfortunately, mine missed. Spend the extra $30 and get real leather."
2.0,Cheat .
2.0,"The product was on the small side, not terribly but smaller for sure. Also the softness that is claimed in the title is an exaggeration, they are moderately soft. I was looking for something softer."
2.0,"Unless you are using a small phone that they used to build 5-6 years ago, this organizer does not hold the cell phone. Different mesh pocket does not hold an iPhone 12. The zipper inside the organizer also does not hold the iPhone. Disappointed since a cell phone is an item you always carry with you when you go for a stroller ride."
2.0,"The quality of this product is terrible.  After waiting a long time for delivery, I opened the package to find pieces broken off so the earrings were unwearable"
2.0,This product has great reviews and people love it in a FB group I follow. I can’t figure out how on earth that’s possible. Maybe if you wore it like overalls with a shirt underneath??? It’s big up top and unflattering on the bottom.
2.0,It runs large.  Material is cheap
2.0,I order it in a 3XL and it fitted like a medium size tight.
2.0,Strings unraveling about the neck area right out the box!  Needed them due to growth spurt off child.  This is the ONLY reason I didn’t return!
2.0,"Started to crack and fall apart within a month of using. My cards started falling out, so I had to go with plan B."
2.0,"While the handbag is very attractive to look at, the whole reason for buying a handbag is to have a reliable place to carry my belongings.  Within two weeks of receiving this bag the lining started unraveling from the inside by the zipper, and I had to sew an entire side of the bag lining.  I was quite upset, as I didn't spend the money so I would have to sew the bag back together myself.  After three months one of the handles came apart.  Not detaching itself from the side, as one might assume, but about four inches of the sewing actually came apart at the top of the handle, and the foam filling in the handle was sticking out.  I ended up having to get a sturdy sewing needle to handsew the darn thing back together so it wouldn't look so cheap and worn.  Very disappointed in this handbag.  I gave it two stars only because it is very attractive."
2.0,"Ordered two. Frame cracked on both from opening the arms of the sunglasses only a couple of days after receiving them. Not durable. Thought I'd save a few bucks. Now I have to buy new sunglass. Buy cheap, buy twice as the saying goes."
2.0,way too large I am 5'3 and 120lbs and the small was way too big
2.0,Title says it all can't reccomend based on my experience.
2.0,These shirts were cut very generous at the bottom. I am large busted so the top fit on top but flared out on my hips. They also have a seam down the back that is completely unnecessary. I ordered XL and L and both fit me poorly. I sent them back. I am a size 16 and want a tunic to cover my hips. These were cut long enough but were too flared.
2.0,"This purse is cute. It’s pretty roomy for a little purse. However, it seems very cheap. It doesn’t really look cheap just by looking at it, but when you feel it you realize it is. Seems like it should have been $5 to $10 instead.  Seems like something you would buy at a swap-meet."
2.0,String broke the first day and the fit was slim.
2.0,"Came on time,  They would not stay still on my glasses. Sorry. Wish they would have worked."
2.0,It broke in one month really pricey for a month belt
2.0,Material is thin so indont think they will last
2.0,Very cheap quality. Scarf doesn’t have logo. Wand is very light and thin plastic.
2.0,Like that it is made in USA.  That is why I purchased it.  It shrinks when washed 2-3 times ... until it no longer fits very well.
2.0,It's a great hat but it came large.. I got a s/m and it was like an extra large
2.0,The leather feels really cheap and hard. I returned the band the next day.<br /><br />update 5/11/17 - Customer Support has reached out to me to see if any of their other products would be a better fit. From 1 to 2 stars for their support service.
2.0,"I bought this for myself because it looked almost identical to my favorite choker in high school. Out of the package it arrived as pictured, except with 2 small, but pretty deep, gouges on one of the belt loops.  The biggest problem is that it comes in a box. That may seem like a good idea if giving as a gift. The problem is the box is typical size for something like a ring or bracelet, but the tiny chain links aren't meant to be shoved into a box like that. There are kinks in the bracelet that prevent it from laying naturally on the wrist: it looks awkward. Since I've had this in necklace form before, I know that once the links move into positions like that, it's permanent."
2.0,Contacted seller with no rely. Item extremely small
2.0,"I would like to return it but I do not have the option to do it, it is too big.  I ordered a medium size but fit like a super plus.  If somebody knows how can I return it I certanly will apreciate a help."
2.0,Ordered a sailed small (usual size M/S) but the small fit like an extra small. Go up a couple sizes for this one.
2.0,I have to return it because it was way too big and my husband didn’t like the material.
2.0,"Comfortable but not tight enough under chest area so not flattering. I ordered XS, 5’2”, 114lbs."
2.0,Returned.  Cheaply made!
2.0,"low price, but cheap build quality. Seam tore in a few washings. Don't recommend."
2.0,"Cute dress, not worth $20. Makes me think of something from Melrose. Should be closer to $10"
2.0,not one of Sitka's best products - cut way too tight in the arm pits - way over priced for value
2.0,Sizes was off
2.0,Maybe I just got a defective pair of lenses... I doubt it. These lenses were way too small. The right lens fell out when I went to clean it. My Oakley Half Jacket 2.0 frames are new so no stretch or fatigue on the frames as an excuse. I read the reviews and fell for it. Please don't fall for it. Look at the price! Duh!
2.0,I wish the straps were adjustable. They are very uncomfortable.
2.0,These do not look like picture - the glasses are darker & you can't see the the blue color
2.0,These are so small. They are for babies not women .
2.0,"Cheap construction, not very warm. I thought they would cover part of your finger, since it says fingerless Gloves, but no, there wrist warmers."
2.0,None of the post worked. I lost every jewels. I'm so upset. I used them so I can't return them. I have the opal ones as well those are fine but the purple was a waste of my money...
2.0,Bad matieral not worth it
2.0,"I bought this product as a replacement to my damaged watch-belt. This rubber lacks an elastic quality & is awfully thin. Although, it might just work"
2.0,"Was working great, until week 3. I took a jog with the watch on my wrist, but then the hands on the face broke. Disappointed."
2.0,"I recommend if you want this dress to order at least 2 sizes down. I am 5'6"" and 170lbs and wear 38DD. I ordered a size 10 and it was way too large. Returned it for a size 8 and still very large. Dress is kind of awkward for my body type and ran big in the worst places. My boyfriend and BFF told me to get rid of it. It was called a trash bag and muumuu dress."
2.0,Cheap material. Super thin and the pattern is off from the pic. Save your money and don't buy!
2.0,The color was purple and not the blue I was expecting. Not French terry for after shower robe. Disappointed. Will return.
2.0,This ring is too chunky and ultimately gave me a sore on the finger beside it!
2.0,I like the pattern but widget was not wide enough. N fabric was very thin.
2.0,I got this to replace the original because it made my wrist sweat. I love the pattern and the colors. BUT it is so thick and bulky that I wasn't able to wear it for more than a few minutes.
2.0,The adjusters come apart
2.0,"Belt is scuffed in places, and smaller than my last one. These are good belts, but no punch with this one seems like I may have gotten a returned belt or possibly manufactured imperfections. The last one was fantastic, but again not this one."
2.0,"I bought this  hoop ring for my septum piercing back in November, it lasted for 4/5 months before a gem fell out. For the price I was pleased so I ordered another, that one arrived broken, return jr and ordered another and within 3 weeks 2 gems fell out. Won’t be ordering from again. You get what you pay for 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,"Ordered this for my daughter who is very thin and wears a small, but the small was way too big.  The overall material was really bad.  It looked like it was very cheaply made."
2.0,Mask was terribly mishappen by the time we got it.
2.0,"I was very excited when I saw these online, but when they arrived, they are CHEAP plastic, not clay at all. Also, they arrived damaged. The posts were completely bent and unwearable.<br /> Not only that, but they poked through the other items they were shipped with and damaged them as well."
2.0,This item did not compress as expected. Very loose and stretchy.
2.0,"Nice watch for the price. Some problems setting date, and no instructions to help with this."
2.0,Beautiful color but sleeves are too short.
2.0,"The top wasn't made bigger to fit the bigger bottom. As a result, it stretched the top out and made it see through and the neckline was very high. Not flattering at all. I returned this product."
2.0,This seemed like a great back for our 3 week Europe trip. After the first day the side seams on both of the bags we ordered started to rip. We noticed several more tears in the seams in the days after that. The tears got larger and larger and rendered the bag useless after the trip. We had about 18 pounds in each and it was too much for the bag to handle.
2.0,The sizing chart on the sales page was unclear resulting in the purchase of shoes that were way too big.
2.0,The arms was too small on my biceps!
2.0,"Watch broke and could not tell time after 2 months of use, oh well"
2.0,"The bracelet is of good quality but the size is all wrong. They claim it will fit a 7 to 8 inch wrist and is a large. Well,,,it measures 2 1/8 one way and 2&#34; the other. So lets call it 2 inch diameter which has a circumference of 6.2 inches.  That means a 6 inch wrist would be a snug fit."
2.0,"I'm using these for spin classes, and in less than one month, the seams are coming apart in 2 different locations - along the inside knee and the front waist. They fit fine and were comfortable but not well constructed."
2.0,"At the price of these shoes , I would expect quality. And part of that would be to have shoe laces so you could immediately put on the shoes you were so happy to order. Who doesn’t have shoelaces in their product. Tacky"
2.0,This is blue and YELLOW not white. It's decent quality but not the colors I was hoping for.
2.0,Runs small even tho I ordered a size bigger and has no stretch
2.0,I cannot find a way to purchase the replacement fasterers.  It's worthless without them
2.0,I’m not a big chested woman and this thing is giving me the boob button gap which makes no sense to me because it’s normal sized the rest of the blouse. It’s also very cheap feeling.
2.0,Nice color but is very small looks like a woman's watch
2.0,"Zipper stuck  a bunch.of times ,hard to use it"
2.0,Way too big and made of cheap material
2.0,I liked the material but I ordered a size too small I guess.
2.0,It's very cheaply made. It was great for a couple of uses. Now we use it as an alter cloth.
2.0,i order it for my birthday and it came on time but it was just TOO large i could put my arm down and it would just slide off and i dont even have small wrist
2.0,"Beautiful, but, didn't come in the size I ordered, which was a 9/16 (bc I plan on going up a gauge). Instead, I got a 1/2, which is where I am now. Also, one twists on w no problem while the other doesn't twist on at all. Speedy delivery, nice plugs, but too bad it's the wrong size and one is defected.<br /><br />I showed my current plugs below the ones ordered"
2.0,I ordered an XL im normally a Lg. Its short on the abdomen and rides up. Sleeves are perfect length though. Im really disappointed.
2.0,I can only fit the shorts and not the top which defeats the whole purpose of buying  this......
2.0,"These were pretty in person but positively huge. Maybe I misread something but upon receipt they were bigger than a quarter. The pearl stuck out way too much in the middle and once on my ears, they looked junky and hulking. I ended up returning them because there was no situation or way in which these would work or look good on me. Plus, because of the size they did not look good on my initial piercing and putting them on the second hole in my ear did not make it look any better. Unfortunate, because these looked good online and the pearls would've made my Halloween flapper costume."
2.0,40c is not really a 40c cups are too narrow to cover c cups. more like b cups. and the 40 feels tighter than my 38c bras. after having this experience i checked back in reviews and found i was not the only one with this issue.
2.0,Child size- not for adults
2.0,It's pretty but I don't think this is gold 18K!
2.0,"I originally ordered this dress to wear with boots a to a winter baby shower. It looks very cute in the picture, but I think you need to be stick thin in order to pull this off. Very cute, but runs very small. Unfortunately, I ended up returning it."
2.0,I got the Jersey and was stunned to see how small it was I got the largest size they had( which was a 4xl) and I kid you not this size was atleast a medium or large. The stitching and numbers where on point but that’s it.
2.0,I was very disappointed in the fit of this dress.  It runs very small.  I returned the dress.
2.0,"Not a good fit. Was ""gappy"" between the legs like a loose diaper."
2.0,they were much to big - cheaply made - I gave them away
2.0,"I loved these when I first got them. They fit well and looked great on. However, they started ripping after their very first wash. I had to throw them away, as there were tons of holes in the seams and they looked ratty after 1 wash! For this reason I am very disappointed in the quality."
2.0,"This dress looks great in the picture and in reality the print and style looks the same, however, the material is cheap completely synthetic and if you're tall - do not get this because it will look like a tunic or a shirt on. I will be returning this."
2.0,The elastic is falling apart after 3 uses.
2.0,The metal prong is too long. Can't attach to my galaxy active
2.0,"I ordered a small, which was described as a 29&#34; waste. They are not a 29&#34; waste, as I have a 29&#34; waste and they fall off me. Elastic not great and very long inseam for a small - even fairly long for a medium. Decent material and I suppose a seamstress could re-make them to something more useful, but that seems like a lot of trouble and expense for a pair of sweats that are simply over-sized. I failed to properly determine the size issue before wearing them for an evening, so now wouldn't feel right in returning them. Will wash and give to Goodwill. My advice - spend more and get something you'll actually wear."
2.0,"Took on Spring Break to Myrtle Beach.  Did not last one trip to the beach without the handles ripping,"
2.0,"Too bulky, but too much trouble to return.."
2.0,Cute socks for a 10 year old
2.0,This was not a vivid pretty light pink - it was more of a muted dusty pink so I returned.  The elastic around the shoulders was also stiff and dug in
2.0,A little big I had to bend it to make it fit and was scared it was going to snap in half.
2.0,Shorts are too short.
2.0,These are not a medium.... they are bigger than all the large under armour and Nike products I have
2.0,I like this cute design and colors. So I picked 2.  I usually wear a large but wanted room so bought the XL. It feels like a medium!
2.0,I found that the dress fit small.  I have never had issues with ordering a medium and the information on your site said it was an 8 or 10.  It ran much smaller.  An 8 is my size where a 10 would be too big.  This dress was maybe more like a 6 or 7
2.0,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
2.0,It fades. Ive worn mine for two times and the gold is wearing off.
2.0,The fabric is like nylon and slips down really easily so it’s really hard to keep on the face.
2.0,"a little too small, not true to size"
2.0,"Nice design, but the casting quality is poor - looks like someone got carried away with a file when they were deburring the corners, wiping out the detail there. The antiqued finish was scratched through on the front right out of the box. Got a refund and spent more on a better buckle."
2.0,"Box was crushed. Glasses are flimsy, ugly and not what I expected from review and picture."
2.0,I like the hat however the velcro wore out really quick and now I cant really wear it.
2.0,"The front seam didn’t line up, so off center half dots the full length of the dress<br />Fabric and fit were as expected<br />Returned"
2.0,It definitely fit to small and looked a lot cheaper in person not very impressed
2.0,"Didn't stay upright, made my ears itch, not what I expected....."
2.0,"I liked a lot when it came , but, after I washed it (I always wash new clothes before I wears them). The visual of the jacket changed from “ UAUUU, so good and cute!!” to “What?? What happened? Looks so cheap!”<br /><br />I’ll keep it anyway because I already lost $125.00 with returning a long winter coat that I NEVER was refunded to my card .<br />I should not buy more clothes from Amazon 🙈 we always are at risk with the quality of the materials and sizes"
2.0,Good product but not what I wanted.
2.0,I loved the style. The broke within a day!
2.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;, with an average build and this dress barely covers my butt. Definitely way too short to wear without something underneath.  I would highly recommend buying a larger ale tha you expect."
2.0,"Not as advertised, poorly made."
2.0,Didn't work at all. Any of them. I had to return. I was heart broken.
2.0,The shirt looks nice but it does fit. I am usually a Large and asked for the XL and still does not as it is to small
2.0,The hinge kind of reacted to my skin. Left black marks. It was easy enough to install on my watch. I just notice that if I sweat it reacts to the main hinge and it’s very unsightly. I’ll have to look at getting a different band. Maybe returning to the original silicone which might react to sweat better.
2.0,All the shoes I have ordered from Amazon has been too small.
2.0,It fit great but my daughter only used it for a month and then it stretched out doesn't fit her anymore.
2.0,Ok so I sized up. I am a size 15 and I purchased a XXL just because I rather error on the side of bigger  and it fit perfectly. I would not have been able to fit in an XL. I am 5’7 and weigh 215 lbs. These shorts are ok. Not the most flattering I would say. The seem at the bottom kinda digs in to my thighs so it makes like this awkward looking indent. So would I wear them out? Ugh.... hell no. Will I wear them around the house on a hot day? Yes! Seem comfortable and covers where I need it to. Maybe I will wear them over a swimsuit if I ever go to like the river but that’s it. Not impressed eh!
2.0,"They shipped like two days after i ordered them which was great. When i first got them they were nice and comfy at first, but i noticed after wearing them twice(I wore them the day i got them and the day after that) that they started pilling in the crotch area and that they started developing a hole. After literally wearing them twice! I do not recommend."
2.0,"When actual item received, was very disappointed.  The picture makes it look so soft and classy.  The actual<br />item looks so different.  Will end up giving it away.  Among all my many Amazon purchases, this is the only item<br />I didn't care for."
2.0,This is a pretty bracelet but it is not very &#34;wearable&#34;.  It turns your skin green seconds after you put it on.  I would NOT recommend this bracelet.
2.0,After 2 wears the toe part is extremely worn and there is no regular size 12. The pads come out. Not worth it. Trash.
2.0,Haven’t tried them on.The package smelled  very strong like a citronella candle. Maybe something spilled on them at the warehouse but good god they were bad. I didn’t get to return them because I didn’t want to stink up my car to take them to the ups store
2.0,Earrings missing stones
2.0,"It did not seem extra long still tight on my husbands wrist,like the other one that did not say extra long it broke.Hoping this one holds up."
2.0,Tight and fits small in the arms
2.0,"I bought this watch in April for my fiance. It was greatly admired when he opened it and finished sizing it to his wrist. Very easy sizing. He set the time and day, but noticed rather quickly that the day did not function properly. It seemed to move too quickly. Assuming that maybe it may be because the time could be reflecting a.m. not p.m., he rewound the watch. It did not fix it, but he still liked the feel and look of the watch, so it was not a big deal. After wearing it for about a week, he accidentally banged it on the table, breaking the glass face. The impact was not that hard. This watch looks really nice, but is not made very well and does not function 100%. Really sad, because it is very stylish."
2.0,I was very disappointed. The size was definitely smaller than a size 12 that my six year old usually wears (and with socks). She couldn’t even get her foot in it. Gave it 2 stars because they do look good. Size up.
2.0,"I believe there is a design flaw in this garment.  The scoop neckline is too large, causing the sleep dress to fall off the shoulders.  It could be an exceptional night dress because the fabric is very soft and it was a perfect fit for my torso,<br />but not for my shoulders.  With reluctance, I returned it."
2.0,This was huge. I ordered based on the listed sizing and it was hanging off me. I'm really upset because I was super excited.
2.0,"Loved this skirt, pretty and fit nicely. But after wearing only  once the seam just unraveled. Poor quality, very disappointed"
2.0,"If these socks are cotton, it is the scratchiest cotton I have seen. I received random sizes, some of the socks were truly tiny."
2.0,Still a little smaller than expected despite ordering larger - really saw this in the arm holes and the chest area. The material is like a drapery material - too thick and bulky for a summer dress.  The waist part hits above the belly button and the bottom half of the dress flares very dramatically - does not lay flat.  It was not flattering.
2.0,Felt extremely cheap.
2.0,Colors are nice. Size to fit but cheaply made.
2.0,It broke in less than a month :((((
2.0,"I bought these and although it is nice to have the different types, after one wear, the metallic coating was gone and my neck was green. Terrible"
2.0,"This literally took me forever to figure out how to even put this on.. there’s a curtain way the “clips” to the watch connect & it was just all around annoying, I thought I had it inside out for the longest time. & the “clips” into the Apple Watch move side to side like it’s not connected right, it makes me nervous that my watch face is just gonna fall off. & this isn’t really meant for people with smaller wrists. & it pinches my skin.<br />Update: I’ve had it for a month & the color is wearing out already"
2.0,these are too small. the pop off my chin if i speak a peep.
2.0,"if the neck of this dress were large and loose like the rest of the dress, it might have been all right. but the neck is not large and loose as it is shown in the photo. the rest of the dress is long and loose, but the neck is small, and it just looks stupid. at least it did on me, LOL. I returned it."
2.0,"Maybe I got a bad one but I bought this to use on a vacation to Washington DC this summer. I followed the instructions and while it did get cool it did not get ""cold"". Maybe if the temperature wasn't approaching 100 degrees then this would be a great product but it didn't work for me."
2.0,"It's really pretty, but turns your finger green after wearing it for a couple hours."
2.0,The key chains are super small. They are not 2 inches in length. Its about 1.7 and the width 1.3
2.0,Don't quite understand the cut of the shirt. It is huge on top and two tapered at the bottom. Bought a large and it fits like a double x
2.0,I bought this dress for a trip to the Seychelles. I wore it to dinner.  It fit perfectly and I received several compliments from my companions.  Three hours later as I was taking the dress off I noticed rips at waist and onthe back by the straps.  The material is very cheap and the rips expanded as I was looking at the fabric.  Buy a size up maybe you won’t have the same issue as I had.
2.0,"Graphic is much more yellow than orange. I didn't like it but my wife, so I accepted a discounted refund."
2.0,"I bought an extra large, it almost fits my 4 yr old daughter. This is supposed to fit adults it's tiny and not worth your money."
2.0,"I was sooooo bummed about these. I used to have my ears stretched and was looking for something to make them appear that they still are without going through the hassle again. I also have a nickle allergy that can be very sensitive. Usually stainless steel doesn't bother me, but these did. They look super cheap and the product I received was totally different than what I ordered. They had hearts on them and looked like something a toddler would wear. They also made my ears itch super bad. Very upsetting."
2.0,"Worked great until after the first week, then individual lights started randomly changing colors and one shoe died except a few lights."
2.0,too tight on my thumb
2.0,Fabric is stiff and not flowing as depicted.  Fits snug for size.  Do not like it
2.0,Nice material but I did not receive my belt. I will wear but I need my belt. I am glad the material isn’t thin. I will put it in the cleaners so it can get pressed. Nice material.
2.0,I am so disappointed in this mask. It's so pretty in the picture. In reality it's a sloppy fit and the bird isn't even visible
2.0,"They weren’t like  small... the butt part just fit so weird, maybe I should’ve sized up but I felt the way the butt was sewn on was just... off. It was like it didn’t stretch properly and they looked weird.  Also I’m short so the band was just too long for me.. I really liked the color though and they weren’t see through.. maybe I got a weird pair idk"
2.0,These shorts do not have a front fly
2.0,Fits pretty well initially but after washing and drying the stiffener inside the waistband gets twisted.
2.0,I bought this to wear on my birthday. Not only was it too large around my waist; it was WAY too long. It just hit the tops of my feet. Short girls stay away.
2.0,"The bottom of the shirt opens up to navel where the knot is.  Very odd, as the top portion had a button that ensured modesty."
2.0,1). If someone needs a large or XL the sleeves should be measured up accordingly. I found them to be uncomfortably tight<br />2) Sleeve length is misleading in this photo. Mine were much shorter than this. Since I prefer my sleeves to be longer I will save this dress for winter months and pair a jacket with it.<br /><br />Otherwise the fit is ok.
2.0,Eyeliner is very messy to put on. I highly advise ALOT of  mascara before trying to apply these and put the eyeliner on.
2.0,Product shipped was both too wide and not a slim fit
2.0,2 stretchy n kept rolling up .i do not recommend this
2.0,It was broken. They said I would get a refund to my discover card but I used my cash back rewards so I didn't get a refund. It is a very nice crown except it wasn't welded in one place.
2.0,Not even close to the color pictured
2.0,I love the way these look and fit so far but I've only worn them once but I did a lot of walking with no problem. The heel has nice padding and my feet feel cushioned and warm.  The only negative would be that I found a small hole inside the lining where the zipper is. I'm not sure if I did that when shoving my foot in. Not a big deal since the hole is inside.<br /><br />UPDATE: I loved these boots the first time I wore them but have worn them 2 more times since. I've notice that the the right heel of the boot feels different than the left. The right heel is more spongy and leaves my foot feeling unsupported like my foot is sinking into mud. The left foot feels fine. I'm not sure why I didn't notice this the first time. I think I might have gotten a defective pair. I'm so disappointed because these were so comfortable at first and I was excited about finding a comfortable shoe that was still cute. :(
2.0,They are extremely thick. Had absolutely no holding power for my sleeves. Maybe they only work on light-weight shirts/blouses?  Didn't work for me!
2.0,Worked well for first two weeks after that it getting foggy often. I purchased this one after reading reviews that it does not get foggy. Did not like the goggles.<br />After using for 2 months I started to see some cracks on both the sides from inside. Can someone from the product/seller team please help?<br />Attached some pictures.
2.0,"Doesn’t hold the band for very long, would need higher sides."
2.0,The hat fits small.  If the hat fit correctly it would have looked and felt better.
2.0,"I love the design of this watch, but I don't like the clasp on the wrist band. It's so loose that it keeps falling off.  A nice gentlemen picked it up on the subway for me.  He could've kept it,  but he gave it back to me.  I don't wear it any longer. Such a waste of money.  Not happy about this purchase. 😢"
2.0,"My wife ordered these for my daughter. Our only complaint is that the picture on Amazon has a tan colored sole on the shoe, but what we received had a black sole."
2.0,"Does not have adjustable nose piece. Good for kids and or flat nosed people perhaps. Update: a company rep contacted me because of this review and offered a choice of two other aegend goggles. I chose this one:<br />Aegend Swim Goggles, Swimming Goggles with Streamline Design - Soft Nose Piece - Premium UV Protection Anti-Fog and 180 Degree Vision, Triathlon Goggles for Adult Men Women 4 Choices https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N52QJ8S/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_ntGyCbSX9R291<br /><br />They fit fine and have a good field of view."
2.0,The material  before being  washed was stiff and dug into my shoulders. After I washed the bra it was much better.
2.0,Links came apart within a couple days. Doesn’t stay in a loop.
2.0,"Looked good, good price but only lasted one day before breaking"
2.0,Def not worth the price way to small and I am 5'3 and 100 pounds. once you add the horns they are not stable! Will not recomend unless you want to give your money away for nothing.
2.0,"Doesn't look cute in person or at all like the picture.  The color I got was not navy but a weird medium dusty blue, which, when combined with the cut and shape of the shirt (also not quite like the photo) looked just like I was wearing belted medical scrubs.  By following other reviews which said to size way up, I did end up with the right size, it just doesn't resemble the ad."
2.0,These were worn ONE day. Cute but not durable at all. The coloring is peeing off. For 30$ not worth it.
2.0,This fit right but looked terrible on me. The neck came up too high and felt too tight around my neck. I kept thinking i had it on backwards but I didn’t. Length was good. Material seemed nice but did not look good for someone like me who has little to no curves.
2.0,I purchased this to replace the area on my Mocs that is fully enclosed and travels from my instep around my Achilles and back to the onset on the opposite side.  This requires a shorter needle due to radius...  description said 3 1/2&#34; in length... what I received is just shy of 5&#34;... there goes my radius advantage ..  I'm writing this review and two stars simply for the serious flaw in description..
2.0,It was a nice shirt but it ran really small. The material is also very clingie so it stuck right to me. Not a fan. Returned the shirt
2.0,"Front tab is too thick to be fed under belt loops & even its own retaining loop. Way too much expansion, also."
2.0,these are much bigger than i expected.. I read the reviews and thought they would be ok but not so much.. I kept them and am planning on using them for a decoration on my Purse.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:42c75342e9414f4d5e3f7995b788802b]]
2.0,I’ve had them for a month and both pairs have started tearing at the inseam on the leg.  Now I have a hole in both pairs.
2.0,Beautiful dress but the upper waist was too small for a curvy figure. I could zip the dress but could breathe-crushing my lungs. There was no extra fabric in the seams to let out. Yet the dress was big in the chest. Had to return it.
2.0,"These don't look anything like the picture in the ad. Very disappointing...Not what I was expecting, and not what I wanted."
2.0,"I ordered this and it looked ridiculous on me. I'm curvy, 175 pounds but my curves tend to look really good in dresses. This, was just not for my body type though. WIth how big my boobs are, it looked like i was wearing a curtain. I returned it. The material seemed really nice though!"
2.0,"Its super cute and looks adorable, but, it is so fricken small. I ordered the XL, the largest size they have and it was still small on me. The width of the size was not so much the problem, but the length of it was. I'm a short person, I'm 5'1&#34;, on a good day, and weigh about 150 and this was not long enough to come up and fully cover my boobs with out having me feel like if I raise my hands I'd pull my chest out of the swimsuit. The strings on the back also felt like they criss crossed in the wrong areas and made me feel like a stuffed pork tenderloin wrapped in strings. I was going to keep it and just work on getting my summer body but I saw that there was a stain on the butt part and it just grossed me out so I am for sure sending this back."
2.0,The post ends we're too small I lose it all the time.
2.0,"The material doesn’t have elasticity, very Restricting and material too small"
2.0,Improper sizing
2.0,Very disappointed the key did not fit the heart. When your boyfriend looks at you on Valentine's and Says my key don't fit your heart.... It's pretty heartbreakig... Way to start a fight on Valentine's Amazon!!!!
2.0,Once I received the shoes I could immediately tell this is a cheaply made shoe. The sides are flimsy and it just seems cheap.
2.0,I wear a size 2. Maybe if you had bigger guages it would look better but the golden rim is just a bit thick compared to pearl inside. I'll keep them as a spare pair
2.0,These beads look fake and too shiny to be authentic.  I kept them anyway.  I have seen real African trade beads and they are not shiny and cheap looking like these.  Laverne
2.0,Only for a few minutes Do they stay cool then they actually feel warm on your neck. I would not buy these not  recommend them.  Sorry 🥴
2.0,Love the fell of it but it's small compartments are small not to happy with it..and strap is small
2.0,"XXL is more like a medium. Material is a strange, thick stretchy synthetic. Was looking for something flowy. This will not swing and flow unless you are tiny and order the biggest size. Returning.  (Red dress is this one, next to another correctly sized 2X.)"
2.0,Runs big and cheap.
2.0,Colors were not as seen. Duller looking
2.0,These snail earrings look three dimensional. They are not! They are flat like pancakes. not worth the money
2.0,"The sweater is advertised as lightweight cotton knitted fabric. This is false advertising, as it is 95% polyester and 5% cotton.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because the fit is good."
2.0,the patern looks very cheap.  not as expected
2.0,The synthetic stones are a darker blue than illustrated by the photo.  They are really quite small.
2.0,"This is so cute, but when I put it on the wave does not lay on my neck. It wants to turn sideways. Good idea, bad design."
2.0,this shirt has to be washed separately drips colour everywhere . dont waste your money
2.0,"I'm returning this hat because it does not work as pictured.<br /><br />In the photo, it looks like this hat comes with a shield. In actuality, the clear part is flimsy, pliable plastic that flares out from the face, not offering full coverage. When adjusted, the clear film comes unsnapped from the rest of the hat."
2.0,I bought this hoping it would be cute and a great representation of my love for reptiles but a week after having it in my nose was swollen and red and I had to go to my piercer to get it removed. The clicker is to hard to open even when it’s not in your nose and the irritation it caused just wasn’t worth it. Hope others have better experiences.
2.0,"I like it but front is super long, you have to hold it up while you walk or you'll step on it and trip"
2.0,"The pictures are definitely better than the actual product. The hat runs quite small. The brim is stiff and very cheap feeling. The material is a  Tweed-looking  foam lined material, nothing like you would expect. The ear flaps provide no insulation is made of the same material as the rest of the hat. I was quite disappointed and subsequently gave it away."
2.0,I ordered up 3 sizes trying to get an oversized fit but it didn't work.  The material is extremely thin too.  This one is going back.
2.0,Needs the plastic ends to fit better
2.0,Nice top. Smelled like cigarettes. Disgusting. But no burns. Wash before wearing. Really dingy looking and it shrunk. Very inexpensive so I'll use for running errands. Too bad.
2.0,It's all tangled to the point where I don't know how I'd even begin to use it
2.0,"I love the color and the feel of the bra. However, I can clearly see that it's much too large for me. Hoping to exchange and do another review once I get one fit for running."
2.0,Nice but to small. I ordered a size up and was still to small across the chest area.
2.0,Much smaller than I expected even though I read the size advertised.  The color was so dull unlike the picture!  Disappointed!
2.0,"If you're thinking about buying this, plan on buying a bigger size.  I bought 2 sizes bigger and fits like a fitted shirt.  Also, this shirt is made of a weird material, very rough, doesn't wash well."
2.0,Small for a mans wrist and plastic clasp is flimsy plastic.  I am not expecting them to last long
2.0,They are too small and it’s hard to use them
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f6ca84f38ec1c4fe257cfb6b28490358]] fit well n very comfy but I ordered blk n got a a very fade blk which means they are supper old
2.0,The earrings are different sizes. The main one I bought the set for stretched out my ear when I put it in. (It hurt a little but I didn't think anything about it. Now the other ones don't stay in my ear and fall out.
2.0,"Lies. It says it is 95% Cotton, not quite. Not to mention omitting whatever synthetic fabric is the other percentage. I don't know what kind of morons they they think people are, but this is not even cotton, or linen, it is a textured authentic. I got this bc cotton is cool in the summer, this will be hot. It is us also see thru,so if you're modest pass.  I happened to have a discount coupon, or I'd be even more peeved. It seems to fit OK, and does look as shown, but the fabric issue is why I am only giving it two stars"
2.0,The fabric has a very loose weave. Doesn't give much protection. Won't be using.
2.0,"These boots are very cute.  Love the color.  They run large, especially in the ankle.  They felt stiff and heavy.  Had to return them.  Sorry..."
2.0,"Beautiful color, but it was just too small on my arms."
2.0,"I purchased this for a gift to go with another item. It does not match at all, so I will be returning. I had hoped the red would be an actual red or cranberry color based on the pictures, but it's oxblood leaning towards brown. The other really disappointing thing about this is that the silver chains shown in the bracelet in the pictures are not silver at all. They're glued to the leather strips, and they've been sprayed with the same oxblood color that's on the leather. In places they haven't been sprayed entirely, so you can see that the metal underneath the paint is gold-toned. The metal tubes at the top and bottom are silver colored, but there are some spots and flaws in the finish. The clasp is also silver and does seem very sturdy and nice. This came in a very nice box, but it was kind of jammed into it, so the bracelet was a bit misshapen. It smells strongly of cheap leather. The way that the color is sprayed on the leather makes me suspicious that it might not be colorfast. I have not tested that theory though."
2.0,"I love the design and print options of this dress.  Only issue, it is not true to size, it runs small.  Suggest ordering  larger size than you normally would in dresses."
2.0,This cute necklace broke the first time my 12-year-old daughter wore it. It was very disappointing.
2.0,The cotton these are made from is not at all soft & the pants were also too big. Even washing & throwing them in the dryer didn't make them softer or smaller.  Ehn.
2.0,Did not fit true to doze at all. Terrible quality
2.0,Its looks good but when I got the item it was damaged.
2.0,I’ll post pictures soon but the hearts are berry sloppy have brown into them so don’t think they look as nice as shown<br />At least they are true to size
2.0,Fabric doesn't loosen up in the time period of a day but the length of the boxers is to short for my liking. Waist line fit perfectly but length was on the shorter side.
2.0,"For only $8.99 I wasn't expecting a whole lot but I was still disapointed. Two of the earrings are broken, one had a piece missing. The rest are ok although they look very cheap. You get what you pay for, right?"
2.0,The gold shine went away within a month.
2.0,They fit strangely and the belt is not attached so it wont stay. Not a huge fan but it could just be my body type
2.0,"So small, I'll end up giving them away. Kind of disappointed because they're pretty."
2.0,The size they specified that would fit my waste was too small.  I dont like the fit but they are wearable...too tight on the legs.
2.0,"I bought the green dress and while the zipper was cheap I kept it and can put it on over my head (&pray it doesn’t split at the zipper while wearing it). I thought oh let’s get the white one. Not only did the white one same size seem to be a lot larger upon taking it out of the package the zipper was broken unable to fix and completely loopsided(honestly felt like I got someone’s return). def returned that. While it was incredibly cheaper than the alternative online, it does show in the quality"
2.0,They slip off the heel. I knew they would
2.0,The black ring in my picture was bronze color. The color left within two days. Same w some of the others. Super disappointed
2.0,"Love the dress.  I was very surprised at how nicely it fits.  Also very pleased with the length.  At 5'6"", sometimes clothes are too short for me.  This is perfect.  Lightweight and breezy.  A great anytime dress for summer.<br /><br />Update:  And then I washed it.  Shrunk."
2.0,These Laser Finger Beams are a fun idea and the light worked well as long as it was handled VERY gently which did not happen a lot with the kids using them.  The bands were hot glued together and instantly broke even when put on my 6 year old's fingers.  The actual plastic casing broke very easily too.  If the light stayed together it was fun.  I wouldn't waste money on it though because it breaks too easily and disappoints.
2.0,The backings did not stay in the hoop so it always fell out.
2.0,"I loved the pattern and the fact that it is a buckle type connection vs. the OEM.  However...this would not lock on.  It fell off repeatedly and I ended up returning it.  Really to bad, because I truly like the pattern and thickness of the band.  It didn't have the cheap, thin feel I had with another replacement band I had bought"
2.0,It’s definitely not surgical steel. It caused me to have a reaction. Sad because these are so cute. Guess I’ll be returning.
2.0,Thin and size runs small. Cheap copy of original copper sox
2.0,"Very pretty plugs, but they definitely sent a size too big"
2.0,The color blue looks very different from the picture. Its cheap and very cheap looking. I do not recommend.
2.0,I bought way larger than I wear.  I wear a 10 and no way is this a 14-16.
2.0,Fell apart less than a month after purchasing.
2.0,I did receive these quickly but they are made very small especially where the design is around the thigh there is no stretch to that part and being a little thick it just didn't work for me. So if you have thicker thighs these aren't going to work for you. Because if you order a size up then the waist and everything else will be too big.
2.0,a little smaller than expected but for the price thats ok. what i really didnt like was not receiving the certificates advertised with the products. the box they come in too could have been just a little bit better built or not on the cheap side.
2.0,Way smaller than expected and the fabric is far too thin (see through). I contemplated sending them back but will just pass along to someone else.
2.0,"As women, we all look for those “TikTok” leggings that gives us the fine sculpted booty. These aren’t it! I hated these shorts; for starters there want any “liftage” and weren’t at all flattering let alone comfortable. I recommend setting a goal to do daily squats and seek a more realistic result; your self esteem will thank you. No one wants to be a Miley Cyrus meme…."
2.0,Yes I knew it wasnt cotton and that was fine.. but the colors are so off (it came with all pastel colors) not like the photo and pattern is off as well. I also think I need alittle more structure. If I had more structure I would try to buy the darker one
2.0,It says L but it runs too small.<br />Poor product.
2.0,these are not the earrings I received
2.0,The fabric is not that great. Blouse is overpriced.
2.0,Really didn't expect this dress to be so see through especially since it doesn't show in the pic of the item. I'm thinking about returning it because it's for an all white wedding and I want to look very classy.
2.0,I was using it for workout only 1 glove work and got warmed never again.
2.0,"The flaw being that it is very thin material and only printed on one side so if you are viewing from both sides as in flying from a flagpole, the opposite side is a complete inverse and gibberish to most people looking at it..  come on, are we supposed to be able to read backwards??"
2.0,They serve their purpose but most od the stones fall out pretty quickly.
2.0,The nose bridge is a noticeably cheap plastic painted gold. I would where these if the plastic wasn't so cheap looking.
2.0,"No Support for walkers, but great for babies"
2.0,"So my glasses showed up, one pair was missing a screw and I ordered some for my daughter and one pair had messed up lenses! Super annoyed I have to send all three back and hope that all 6 pair come like they should be!"
2.0,Cute but very Small. More for a little Child than a teen or adult woman.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:b22a00dda0c6033fc8e8cde242c84b1f]] I like the product. But i haven’t even wore it for a month and it’s already broken. I would say just making it one continuous ban and not having that clasp because that’s where it is broken. Lovely colors though.
2.0,It doesn’t really look like the product photos. It’s a thicker material. The green is more of a brown green than the pretty emerald color. Boxy shape.
2.0,Purchased the clear glass with the intention of being able to take them to my eye doctor and replace the lenses with my prescription. Sadly the glasses where not how I expected them. The glasses where not clear and it looked like they where super dirty. Not only that but there was glue residue on them.
2.0,I really loved the necklace. I bought it less than a month ago and I went to move my hair from my shoulder and barely had the necklace with the hair and the chain broke. I’m glad it was within the return window for the price I paid.
2.0,"I’m on the smaller size of “plus,” and this doesn’t fit. I’ve even lost weight (from 16 to 14) since purchasing it, and it still doesn’t fit lol."
2.0,Disappointed wanted both the lips and lipstick. Discription says red lip and I only received the lipstick not the red lips... and there does not seem to be an area to select one or the other.
2.0,"I loved everything about this set, except when I washed it for the first time the seams pulled apart on the pants! I washed it in a gentle cycle and air dried it. Not sure if I am able to exchange for another one.<br />Note: The manufacturer is not responding to my request for exchange.... such a shame because I love the product!"
2.0,"Product is not as long as it appears in the photo. Fabric is of lower quality, lightweight but not dry fit or wicking."
2.0,Bra is super stretchy so there is little support.  Similar to a sports bra with an underwire.
2.0,The head snapped off day 2 rendering the flashlight useless.
2.0,"The dress looked much better online.<br />It's true to size, length is good. The material choice wasn't good.<br />It just didn't work for me."
2.0,"Kind of cheaper looking , but worked ..Material is kind of thin and the white did not look quality enough"
2.0,large fitting
2.0,Watch was beautiful. But the face was hard to read and the lighted dial was not bright enough to see in the dark. Dealing with Cirelli Jewelers was unpleasant. You have to pay to return it. They charged me $10.00 for returning it. Will never buy an item from Cirelli again.
2.0,The LargeUS  ran really small and i went based on the size chart but it was not accurate
2.0,Very large! It was also an itchy polyester material that is rough. I will return.
2.0,"My daughter loved these school shoes but the velcro doesn't stick anymore, after only two months. I am going to have to get her new shoes, even though these are in great shape. So disappointed!"
2.0,Nice warm and fitting sweater but the shoulder ripped the second time I wore it!
2.0,Love the graphic but the size is way off .. either the wrong tag got put in it or it was a child's t-shirt. Judging from this You'd have to get an XXXL to be close to the size of this shirt. I ended up giving to my 10 year old neighbor.
2.0,"I was really surprised at the quality of cotton, very itchy, even after washing several times with fabric softer.  The fit was off after washing also, so I gave them to my roommate."
2.0,"My wife has a white gold ring with a flawless diamond.  But we wanted something she could wear while traveling with less concern about losing it, so I got her this.  Well it is lighter than her other ring, so it feels cheap.  The silver is not polished to shine well enough and lacks the shine of a quality ring.  The cubic zirconia stone does not sparkle like her diamond ring, and in fact looks cloudy and faded or hazy even.  some parts sparkle very well, but other portions look hazy and show no sparkle.  As long as no one looks too closely, she will be fine, but I am quite dissappointed in this ring.  I will be looking elsewhere for a better replacement."
2.0,"While the fabric felt nice, this was more like a medium rather than the bigger size I purchased. I wish I could have worn it because the fabric at least felt nice"
2.0,"It was good while it lasted.... 4 months.<br /><br />2 months in, the inner change pocket zipper broke, then last week, the four month mark to the day, the outer zipper broke.  I was in Target when this happened so fortunately I was able to pick up a hold over replacement until I have time to shop for a better one.<br /><br />I really liked the small, handy size of this purse, that fit my phone, cards cash etc., without being too big to grab and go.  Too bad the workmanship didn't hold out though."
2.0,Haven’t wore these yet and they are already changing color.
2.0,"These were very cute but way too tight. Like other reviews mentioned, the stripes are not white- more of a lighter color of the color leggings you choose. That didn’t bother me though! I decided to send them back bc they were just too tight. I would have sized about 2 sizes up"
2.0,The clasp is too small and rough so my hair gets caught in it all the time so I never wear it.
2.0,"I loved and wanted the Jade bracelet as it is advertised, color and authenticity..  With discouragement, this bracelet white in color is not what I wanted."
2.0,They are ok. Look a little cheap
2.0,"Soft, but I washed on cold it shrunk a ton still. Soo I wouldn't order again. :("
2.0,Gave it to a granddaughter.
2.0,This bag is small. Returned it.
2.0,"The band did not ever clamp securely to the fitbit, always lose a little bit.  It would come off on both sides with any activity at all.  Working in the yard would require stopping every few minutes to attach it back.  The clasp that held the band on for adjustment also came lose frequently.  When one of the ends of the band pulled out, I could not put it back together, so I returned it to Amazon.  It was in the return window, so they made good on their promise.  I replaced the stainless steel band with a silicone band and the coming apart stopped immediately!"
2.0,The material was very soft. This dress clung to my skin the whole time. It didn’t look too good with pictures of my whole body. Just from the band line and up.
2.0,The threads came loose right out of the bag. Not made well at all. Definitely for a once and throw night
2.0,"Flimsy - cheaply made - really cheap, wish I could just return them  Unless you have a Jennifer Lopez backside - they are so thin and sheer - you see everything and every movement."
2.0,The stitching is poor so it comes apart easily.
2.0,"As much as I want to like this, I can't even get it attached to my fitbit. I can't get the pins on due to the thickness of the band. Its just sitting there, unuseable."
2.0,Quality not to good
2.0,Descripción
2.0,"Shirt fit fine, but the fabric is &#34;weird, cheap, unnatural&#34; and whatever else the other bad reviewers said. I'm thinking it should be remarketed as a swim top or some nonsense. Returned it."
2.0,Nose pads are too small and create a pain point due to the weight of the glasses and balance.
2.0,"Color not as Vibrant as shown here on amazon. Actual color are Washed Out. With A LOT of unfinished loose ends. Many loose Button, needs to be tighten up. Came with a missing button in the middle. Very Easily Wrikle."
2.0,The shorts material  were too thin you could see through them and the shirt was tight.
2.0,"It could be a great swimsuit, but it fits very poorly.  i can tell getting a smaller size would have done nothing to fix the problems I have with this swimsuit.  First off, the back strings do not hug your back like in the picture.  instead, they stretch directly from your shoulders to your butt in a vertical path, with a huge gap between skin and fabric where it should hug your butt. (think suspenders)  if anybody was close enough they would get a nice view down into the back of the swimsuit.  It COULD be altered with effort and good sewing background  but I really don't have time for that sort of thing.  Also, the leg cut makes for an equally awkward-looking butt, not narrow enough to be very cheeky like the picture, but not wide enough to fit your but comfortably.  it's not pretty.  I wanted to like this swimsuit but it just wasn't happening.  Fabric was sturdy, has cup linings, and could have been awesome, but the shape was all kinds of unforgivably wrong.  disappointed."
2.0,"Very pretty but not durable whatsoever. First time i wore it three of the corset liners (plastic strips, similar to the underwire of a bra) came out! Its still wearable but doesn't slim at all like a corset now and one side is straight while the otherside without the lining is not, obviously."
2.0,Liked the colors but the material and belt was very cheap .
2.0,Material is very thin. Totally see thru
2.0,"This product is not as pictured, there is no pouch as pictured if you have long hair."
2.0,"Luckily we tried them out before XMAS, only one worked.  Won't be buying these again."
2.0,"This was a really nice looking band and I was entirely happy with it, except it wouldn't stay clasped shut. When I first got it, it was fine. After a couple weeks, it became hard to click it shut, until I figured out to push the buttons on the side in just a bit when trying to close it. A few weeks after that, it opened and shut fine. After a few more weeks, it started occasionally popping open. I tried adding a link to wear it looser or taking one out to wear it tighter and it happened either way. I wore it like that for a couple years, with it popping open once or twice a day. Since it is still a loop, even open, losing it wasn't an issue. Finally it started popping open 5-10 times a day and I'd had enough and replaced it. Aside from the clasp, though, it was nice looking and looked brand new the whole time."
2.0,"I am a solid XL in most brands, sometimes L. I was very excited for this but severely disappointed. I read the reviews and ordered the XL. The fabric was fairly cheap feeing and very thin.<br /><br />1. The torso was extremely short and I could barely get it on.<br />2. It wasn’t even close to being able to button close."
2.0,"These should be labeled slim fit. Even with ordering a size larger they are too snug in the butt and thighs. Yes, men have thighs."
2.0,"The product itself material wise is good. But the sizing is so far off, I bought a large, I am 6ft. The arms are the length of a 5 yr old. My wife tried it on who is 5'8 and even for her the arm length was far to short. Very disappointing."
2.0,"from the picture of the necklace on the girl it looked a lot smaller than it actually is, the color is off too, going to send back for a refund"
2.0,The snowman is much larger than I had thought it would be. Why doesn't amazon feature their jewelry on some sort of  model so that their customers can get an accurate item size.  Still a pretty pendant though
2.0,EDIT: SELLER OFFERED ME A REFUND IF I CHANGED MY REVIEW TO 5 STARS. So I wouldn't entirely trust any five star reviews.<br /><br />They look cute online but the sizing is a nightmare. Straight. Up. Awful. I ended up having to spend an additional $60 to get it altered so my boobs weren't on show.
2.0,The fabric was super plush and velvety however I could not squeeze myself into this costume and I am thin framed and 130lbs. The material just had no stretch and also no zipper! You have to slip it on. I was lucky I had someone to help me get out of it otherwise I would have been stuck inside of it like a straight jacket. Lol!
2.0,"I like the bands themselves. However, I will not be using them as the plastic connectors pop out a bit on the end of the watch(i bought the appropriate size for my watch. They are not too big for the watch ) and I am worried they will get caught and break. These are not high enough quality to place on an expensive watch."
2.0,"They are definitely not tummy control. However, the fabric is comfortable."
2.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter last year.  She had to start gluing the sole to the boot at places after 6 mos.  She said she wore them alot. Every other day at least, so I wonder if that had anything to do with it, but I am disappointed that she had to do that at all.  She said they were comfortable----the gluing was what concerned me."
2.0,These are well made but certainly not 'long' and they sit below the waistline. Overall just not comfortable and I returned them
2.0,"The 'sparkles' you see in the photos aren't real, it's just an iron on design. It'll do for the price I paid, but I haven't washed it yet to see how well it holds up."
2.0,Have only had these a short time but the elastic in the waist has already died to they won't even stay on. Will not repurchase them.
2.0,"It is soo cheap you can feel it, way too light. Looks are mediocre but not terrible"
2.0,"The best, has a nice sparkle, the least, smaller than expected."
2.0,"I liked the thought behind this, but in use it was very difficult for me to slide cards out without sliding out cards I didn't intend to slide out, and getting them back in was more of a chore than it should have been. I ended up returning it.<br /><br />I can see why it would be attractive for some, but it didn't work out well for me."
2.0,"Even with the Velcro adjustment, it didn't fit and I'm a 5'7 woman but I am slim. It does fit my 24 yr old son but he also had to add more Velcro on for a better fit! Do not like the mesh! He is going to use a surgical mask under it witch also made it more secure and safer!"
2.0,Fabric is also pretty thin... you get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,A lot longer than I expected.
2.0,It looks like a muffin top.  The bottom part of the blouse doesn't look like the picture.  It's like a muffin top.  Unattractive.  The color is beautiful.  The only way I can wear it is to tuck it into a skirt/pants.  By doing it like loses the style I wanted.
2.0,"If you’re looking for a strap where you can the glasses from your neck, fine. If you’re looking to avoid the tail, look elsewhere. Way too long and hang between my shoulder blades. Also neoprene is not meant to be folded but how do they package these - folded. Now have a nice crease for no good reason. One can do much better than these despite the cool designs."
2.0,"plug broken, not as large as i thought it would be"
2.0,discolored and just a plain chain no charms
2.0,"Although this necklace is very pretty. The chain is very short and does not fit around my neck. And I have a small neck. So now I either have to return it, buy an extender or give it as a gift to a child."
2.0,"Very disappointed in this suite, the top fit in the bra but the rest just looked very unattractive and hugged in all the wrong places,  the shorts were a weird fit and kept sliding down.. I ordered my size and it actually felt like it was defective..will be sending back."
2.0,"I typically avoid anything other than a bootie because it is so hard to find true wide calf knee boots. So I was hopeful when I ordered these that they would work. The shoe material feels like decent quality (not great) and the shoe part fit as expected. However, when I started to zip, it didn't make it very far at all. For something advertised as wide calf I would expect to at least make it past my ankle, and these are just not it. If you actually have wide calves, avoid these."
2.0,Don't fit well at all - the sizes are off. Buy a size bigger to actually fit.
2.0,I'm 5'8&#34; tall and this dress didn't even come to my ankle.
2.0,Fell apart after a week of wearing it in shower and asleep...so not to bad for the price...just maybe take it off while doing those things and it will last long...all I need to do replace the hoop the connects it to the chain.
2.0,The woman pictured must be very short... they don't go as high as in the picture.
2.0,This has the weirdest fit. The bottom is smaller than usual and the top is looser. The bottom also does not hide lower belly fat and keeps giving wedgies and the top just looks sloppy due to the flappy sleeves. Looks cute in picture online so I was really hoping this worked. Disappointing for a bigger girl (xl) trying to wear a cute two piece set that hides arms and shows only a little belly.
2.0,"For something labeled a &#34;sleep&#34; bra, I would think this would be a lot more comfortable than it is. Don't get me wrong--this is way more comfortable than the typical underwire I wear during the day, but I find the lace on this to be especially scratchy and irritating. Unfortunately it's not great quality. 2 stars because at least in terms of functionality it's not bad."
2.0,"It work as an under layer, provide not compression even at a smaller size. It is very thin."
2.0,"The fabric and stitching are alright, but I purchased the navy/aqua/white dress that looks like it has a chevron stripe.  The dress I received is the correct colors but the stripes on the bottom are not chevron. They are wavy and definitely define my belly to look like I have a baby bump :/  VERY unflattering!  Returning.  Bummed."
2.0,"Completely the wrong color. The photo isn't even close. However, it is a nice tie if it had been the right color."
2.0,"It is pretty, but it is bulky and heavy."
2.0,"The dress fit and looked nice on. However the material is a little costumey and the color is NOT eggplant. Its is a bold purple. I ended up wearing it to the theater at night (still unsure about the material tho, plus the piping is lighter in color than the dress.  Idk where else ill be able to wear it except maybe to a sexy club."
2.0,Broke pretty fast.
2.0,Thought these were a good buy<br />For fishing this past summer<br />Over 3/4 ended up not useable<br />Never lit up...<br />Ones that did worked ok.. about 3 hours
2.0,Don’t have enough cushion on the bottom.
2.0,too small. for anyone.
2.0,Really liked the idea got for my daughter in her first car. but in the pictures and the description it’s not clear there will be a name on it.  Ended up with Kathryn that’s not my daughter’s name. We ended up keeping it and joke about the name difference because it would not be worth sending back since I do not have Amazon Prime.
2.0,Uncomfortable but they stop the glare.
2.0,I didn't realize it was going to be homemade and poorly made.  I could have sewn it better myself.  ugh
2.0,To flimsy.
2.0,These are cute but do not stay in your ears. First time I wore them I lost one. And before that I had to keep adjusting them and checking them. They thread up pretty easily and I was constantly pulling them back down.
2.0,Didn’t. I ordered the green. The color is really pretty. The dress was made wrong. Around the waist is about an inch thick elastic type thing. It was sewn weird. I tried it on thinking maybe it would stretch out and be ok but it didn’t. It remained bunchy on one side and was definitely noticeable.<br />The material and color were good but I returned it bc of the defect.
2.0,"I went by chart carefully!  Read all comments and thought if I went up 2 sizes I'd be ok.  No.  Hate returning items due to mobility issues..  this maker offered a ridiculous $6.00 for me to keep.  No way. Pay $30 and getting back $6.00 is crazy. So I will have to go thru the hardship of returning.... Not happy with the whole thing being a waste of time and energy.  Material was nice, but the dresss not made right as far as fitting goes.  Don't waste your time!"
2.0,Never even got to see or feel the thing UPS had to send it back because they got damaged. Guess I'll just keep using my rope.
2.0,Pinches and stick out so it's kinda funny looking. Other than that cute
2.0,Very thin material....Slightly see through
2.0,"I had these in my cart for weeks and finally bought them, but found them disappointing. The biggest issue is that 1 elephant had 3 legs where the 4th had broken off. I also thought they would be more 3D, but they actually are pretty flat. Anyway, Amazon refunded me but I don't love these earrings anymore."
2.0,"Review said to size up, but you should double or triple the size up"
2.0,"The bottom is a stiff, weird material, and it has pleats in a really weird spot in the back."
2.0,Thin in a good way. Not very wind blocking. The giant reflective printing to show the glasses holes looks ridiculous.
2.0,"I returned this item, it fit well but the 2nd time I put it on 2 of the buttons fell off of the front. Made in China"
2.0,Love the design but leaves the fake silver blue/green markings on nose....
2.0,It fell apart really quickly.
2.0,"These are really cheap costuming gloves. They suit their purpose, but they're made of cheap halloween material."
2.0,They didn't fit. Get the adhesive material melted and molded was easy enough. But after putting them in they looked more like Bubba teeth. The fangs themselves were very sharp and kept puncturing my bottom lip. Not practical for more than a few seconds of wear. The direction says the teeth can be filed to fit better. They can... If you enjoy having splintered bits of fake teeth in your mouth. Will stick to the individual fang sets from now on.
2.0,"Cute, but doesn’t protect the edges well. It’s not a perfect fit for my iPhone SE."
2.0,"Did not have all pieces was pretty dissatisfied, and none of it was sorted like in the picture. I probably won't buy again."
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap in price and quality
2.0,"Ordered a medium but received a small. In fact, small wasn’t an option when ordering. Zippers are difficult to zip; do not have a smooth action."
2.0,Gray band broke after one weeks wear
2.0,These gloves work well in temperatures in the 30’s. Even in the 20’s my fingers were cold. Definitely not a minus 30 degree gloves. Not even close!!!
2.0,"This necklace, though pretty, was not practical. The wire holding the heart pendant had to be screwed and unscrewed to open and close. I couldn't put it on without assistance. A hook type clasp would have been better. I ended up returning this purchase."
2.0,Material was to thin and did not hang right when worn.  Returned item.
2.0,"I like the quality of these sports bras but unfortunately, the sizing within the pack is not consistent. I have tried 2 of them so far for trips to the gym and one is bigger than the other. My bust measurement is 38 inches and I ordered the large."
2.0,"ordered  small and it was WAY TO BIG!!!! I am 5'9 and 140lbs, and this thing fell right off!"
2.0,"These readers are very uncomfortable! The magnet on the bridge is weak.  I’m sorry, I would not recommend these readers"
2.0,I Have Never The 24/7 Championship Toy Belt Because I Need One More Belt
2.0,These were so tight that I could barely get them on. Unable to use at all. Too short as well. Do Not recommend
2.0,One wasn't sewn well and came apart after only a couple of weeks of use.
2.0,"If I have reviewed this a few months ago, I would have given this 5 stars.  However, the back strap has now ripped off of two pairs this summer and I must have the strap to wear them.  I am a grandma, so if you have a kid who is hard on shoes, don't expect long life.  Very wide for most kids, I war an 8-8.5 E women and the 5-6 fit me well. so these do run large."
2.0,Just did not love this swimsuit. Scalloped edges seems to much on the legs. Quality appeared to be nice.
2.0,Boobs don't fit in the right spot. Don't think it was made for bigger breast
2.0,"Top is super cute, but the bottoms, even though a large, would probably fit my 7 year old p"
2.0,One of them broke after one wear.. I guess you get what you pay for
2.0,"I really liked the shoe for my son, but a hole was wore in the heel of one of the shoes (on the interior portion) within about 3 weeks of wearing.  Guess I got what we paid for.  Might be perfect for kids who aren't as active."
2.0,"These are my favorite leggings. Sqaut proof with good compression. But the last 3 pairs I bought have all started coming undone at the seams, less then 5 months since I bought them! I have pairs that are older and still in great shape. Pretty bummed this happened"
2.0,"The quality is good, but these don't fit well if you have a muscular butt and legs."
2.0,With very little wear the sole is falling off 4 months after purchase.
2.0,"I sadly have to return these adorable owl print leggings as they are printed upside down. :(  I am reordering in hopes the new pair is printed correctly. They did fit well otherwise, which is why I gave two stars.. Keeping fingers crossed on the new order."
2.0,Driving glasses arrived via US mail and were as expected.  Glasses had no damage; however the clear plastic case arrived broken in 4 pieces on the hinge side of the case.  Not a problem because I have several unused prescription glass cases.
2.0,Pretty but the quality not worth the money.  Do not match and do not look like real stones.
2.0,It is pretty but it turned color.  It is hard to write with.
2.0,Little bit too small
2.0,"2 stars because it's really cute, I couldn't get it pass my hip and the romper looks so huge....cut really small seems I would need xlarge instead of medium which I never ever worn a xlarge or large in my life"
2.0,Very light and bend easily... Also get stuck in my hair. I rarely wear these.
2.0,Nice looking Jacket but too small. The jacket runs small
2.0,The product looks cheap.
2.0,The small to medium are WAY too big for my glasses
2.0,"The material is quite thin, and the coverage of the butt is minimal which makes it a bit uncomfortable."
2.0,"Shortly after receiving the watchwinder, one of the rear winders started making a lot of noise. It had been several months so<br />I contacted Amazon and was told to contact Heiden, the manufacturer, not CartWheelDeal, the seller, since it would be a warranty issue at that point. After multiple calls and emails with no response from Heiden, I dropped it because I could live with the noise (I keep it on a shelf in a closet)and it was still working fine.).  The loud winder finally broke and Heiden would not honor their 12 month warranty.  Moreover, refusing to return the winder to me after it was submitted for warranty repair.  Steer clear."
2.0,Fabric is not soft - not very impressed
2.0,Waist fit as expected. Length is VERY short. My kids don't like that they are not longer as their legs still rub against the seat of their bike while riding. Returning for a longer pair of bike shorts.
2.0,These are not ankle pants...they nearly come over the knee for my 7 year old granddaughter...very thin also.
2.0,Very short and tight and mafdmafde of polyester
2.0,Super thin material and incomplete hems. Please see pictures. Item delivered in the bag pictured without any additional packaging. Fit was appropriate (size medium).  Disappointed with this one.
2.0,"Was too long for my liking, feels like bathing suit material...."
2.0,Randomly comes undone and falls off.
2.0,The pants fit strange.  They are tight around my butt which I was expecting a loose fit like the basic training pants I used to have.  Too bad because I really like the design.
2.0,Was excited to find waterproof work boot. Disappointed that they are not comfortable for work boot. No cushion insole. Need very thick socks or added accessory for arch support. Returning item.
2.0,Very low quality product. Looked like cheap pajamas. Did not look like a ninja.
2.0,They look good - but when putting on for the first time clasp came apart. I was able to put it back together and squeezed it tighter using some pliers. It appears to be working fine now. We will see if it lasts. I expected better quality.
2.0,Kinda looked like a wizard of oz costume in person
2.0,"Was too big, returned."
2.0,Somewhat small. And it def doesn’t look like the picture. It’s like a shirt. Not a sweatshirt. Very thin
2.0,"The length was perfect, but the sleeves were to short and the shoulders were to tight."
2.0,"I was not pleased with this purchase. I bought the same pair, in the same size in blue and they fit perfectly. I love that pair. The grey ones are to tight and they have already started to come apart. Definitely disappointed. Sizing should fit the same."
2.0,One of the shoulder straps frayed all the way through on the THIRD day of use.
2.0,Uncomfortable and skimpy.  This was not a good purchase.
2.0,The top is too small and the legs too long
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:6ddfb4acc7af2bf25e384888c694778a]] This hat works for the costume party I’m attending, but it is a $5 hat that you would find at a party store in your town.  Certainly priced high on Amazon because of the convenience factor. Don’t set your expectations too high."
2.0,"Looked nothing like what I had expected from the material it was made, the too small fit on the xxl size purchased to also the stenciled embroidery design. I gave it to my sister since it looks and feel more like what a woman would wear. This is not a man's shirt design strictly for women or for those men who would wear something like this."
2.0,"First of all, sizing runs far too big.  Secondly, I don't see where it will do a darn thing to lift your bootie. Third, the leg portions come down way too far if you want to wear this with skinny jeans or leggings.  If you did so there is no way the shapewear would not show."
2.0,Horrible<br />So tight
2.0,"Unfortunately, these are crap. I ordered two different colors. One pair was shorter than the other and then after I washed both of them they were both extremely short. The material is not soft at all. They look great in the picture and like crap in person. Now I’ve worn them and wash them so I can’t send them back."
2.0,"UPDATE: One month after this review, the zipper and bag has finally broken. You can pay $11 right now, but be prepared to pay another $11 for the replacement soon after! Very low quality, my review has changed from 2 stars to 1 star :/<br /><br />A great deal if you're looking for a bargain. However, the material seems thin and cheap. Mine has not torn or broke yet, but I can tell that it's eventually going to with the thin material. When I put my Nintendo Switch in the main pocket and close the zipper, I can feel material stretching/ripping more and more. I already know it's going to be a matter of time until the zipper gives way or the cloth rips apart. I would say it's made from the same material as those promotional give away tote bags.<br /><br />Also the design is a bit questionable. When the satchel is behind your back, the main pocket's zipper is facing down towards the ground. So if you're carrying the bag behind on your back (especially while doing a physical activity) and the zipper happens to loosen and zips open a bit, you might have some of your stuff fall out."
2.0,Quality subpar
2.0,Too thin.  I don't like that the material is so thin it is c-thru.  haven't worn it!
2.0,The fit was way smaller then I thought it would be and there were holes in the fabric along the zipper.  I returned the item at my own cost of over 8 bucks.  I WAS excited about the product but would never buy from this company again.
2.0,"I am 5'3"", between 110-115 lbs. I read the reviews that mentions this product running small, but b/c I am on the short side, I ordered a small for length purposes. Length wise this is perfect. Waist wise, it's extremely tight and gives me a gross muffin effect. It's so tight its a huge relief to take this skirt off after a few hours. Also, I am not sure if it advertises this, but be prepared to wait for this skirt for 2 months."
2.0,Cute design and print. Dress was too big.
2.0,The sweater was not as long as it appeared in the picture and much thicker than expected. Would recommend if you are in a really cold area but definitely way too thick to wear in AZ.
2.0,Looking at everyone’s pictures and reviews it seemed like these shirts ran huge. Nope. It’s supper small and after running in the dryer it can now almost fit my 2 year old. You need a flesh colored bra if wearing this because it’s almost translucent.
2.0,"I bought three pairs of these, three different colours. All large, all vastly different in size. One is perfect, the black pair. The grey large are way too small for me. They literally don’t fit me. I can’t even try to wear them. And the blue pair, are way bigger then the black pair. I don’t understand how they can be so inconsistent. The blue pair came with no tags either. Really disappointed. The only reason I bought the grey and blue was because I enjoyed the fit of the black. Now I have trouble other pairs I’ll never wear. It’s a pity. And they’re not cheap."
2.0,The shirts are great quality soft and stretchy. I ordered 2 mediums and received one large.
2.0,Did not like how big the cups were in this. Returned.
2.0,"I like everything about this dress - color, fabric, cut. It feels like it will be very nice and cool in the summer. Unfortunately it has a very strong, chemical smell. I've never had an article of clothing that would smell so bad, like something from Auto Zone rather than dress. It's really pretty bad - the dress was in my living room and we could smell it all the way in the dining room!<br />I washed it twice and soaked it in fabric softener and it helped a lot. I would say it's 80% gone. I still wouldn't be comfortable to wear it in any social situation, because if I had to sit next to someone or give them a hug, they would definitely smell it. Too bad, it's a pretty dress."
2.0,Was hoping for a super soft robe. This one is a bit stiff and definitely not that soft. Material feels a bit cheap.
2.0,Very dissatisfied with the material. Had to gift it to another. Not at all like other Allegra K tops!
2.0,"The seller is fine, but the socks are not.  Every time I wear them, the tops of my toes get sore because the seams are so rough.  It's bad enough that I can't wear them again.  I need to look for a different product."
2.0,"I am so incredibly disappointed. This was supposed to be "" the dress"" for me. Didnt fit, was tight around my bottom and "" poofed out"" around the stomach. Bummer. I'm sure it will fit someone who is flat bottomed and no curve."
2.0,the black chips off really easily
2.0,It is really pretty but always catches on pillows and clothing. Would not recommend
2.0,[[VIDEOID:abc02339653696ad7382135094426016]]
2.0,The back of it fell off the first time I wore it. The band has more of a yellow look than a gold look. But you can't expect a lot you get what you pay for. It only cost six dollars. Don't recommend to buy it. You'll only get to wear it once.
2.0,I loved the color and the quality of this shirt. I ordered the next size up from what I normally wear-and it is about 2 sizes too small.
2.0,"These slippers arrived damaged, a great big rip in the top ankle of the left slipper. Obviously cheap and not worth the money."
2.0,Run small. I would order 1 size up. I ordered 1/2 size up and it was not enough.
2.0,It was way smaller than I expected and the dabroc was not flattering at all
2.0,I read other reviews and ordered 1 size up. It fits but is a little bigger than I would have liked. I ordered the purple and its washed out. Very old/multiple times washed looking purple. I'm so disappointed.
2.0,"I ordered these after they sat on my wish list for a year.<br />They are BIG. I felt like a child wearing comically big shorts. But they waist was tight! Odd sizing here. The fabric is stiff and the detailing that is cute on the promo image is barely noticeable on the actual shorts. The pockets are also slick and shiny - I'd imagine stuff will fall out of those easily.<br /><br />I am 5'9, 140 lbs and bought a Medium. I will be returning."
2.0,"Helps with UV protection, but comes apart fairly easy."
2.0,Very hard to get on and off the face.  Not what I expected when I purchased.
2.0,Good buckle but mine arrived after being drug across the factory floor.
2.0,"This is super cute and comfy and  I thought I loved them, but when I run they ride down and I’m constantly pulling them back up. I have several similar shorts and never have had this issue. It’s quite frustrating."
2.0,"The colors were nice, but the shirt was too small.  We didn't like the square buttons either.  It gave it a bit of a feminine appearance."
2.0,Not as nice looking as the photos - dinky looking.
2.0,It was my size but it was too tight.
2.0,"This top fits weird. The length is short, but the width around your chest is wide and it makes it weird and floppy."
2.0,"great earrings, but they sent two of the same side so they look weird :( really pretty though and i will be returning them"
2.0,Cheaply made... Disappointed. Very thin material
2.0,I got this to dress up my Boston terrier for a wedding. It's supposed to be adjustable but it doesn't really stay adjusted. The clasp is really weird. This bow did its job for the day but I doubt it would last more than a day or two unless you've got a really chill dog.
2.0,Fit snug around the mid/bust area. Tight around the arms. SUPER big around the neckline (That should have formed to the neckline).
2.0,"I purchased a few of these in 2020 and really loved the thick, high quality and supportive fabric.  I bought a few more in 2022 and they are a completely different and lesser quality than they were previously.  The fabric is thinner and more stretchy, less supportive.  The foam inserts are lumpy and thin, nothing I could even wear under a shirt without looking ridiculous.  Unfortunately these will be returned."
2.0,"Hi i used these gloves to blow snow. They turn on and the warmest setting does get sort of warm but my fingers and thumb freeze in them.<br />Can i get a different pair, these are bad even if i have to up grade to a better pair?<br />i can't use these, sorry"
2.0,Muy delgados
2.0,Liked the dress but it was small & I ordered up. It just didn't look right. I like my other dresses I order because they fit perfect.
2.0,The material was nice and the straps heldup well with a lot of weight/items in the bag. However two of the zippers broke within the first two days of using it 😞
2.0,Had to cut holes for my ears to keep it on.  Extremely thin.
2.0,"Two stars for the price. These are not sterling silver, as advertised. They already had small black chip marks on them. The quality is closer to $2 per pair. On a positive note, shipping was fast and they came with a cloth holder."
2.0,One pair has a huge hole in it before I even took it out of the package
2.0,"It's not as pretty in person, and it was horribly wrinkled! I tried to get the wrinkles out but to no avail. It just looks higher quality in the photos"
2.0,Basically as everyone else said the lights stopped working after wearing them one time. It's not like they were used to run a marathon or jump around either. The wiring on these is not well done obviously. I will say even with no working lights though they look cute as shoes.
2.0,Very disappointed in the quality.  The choker looked a lot better in the picture.  But it was cheap so I guess that explains it.
2.0,So I don’t know if these are factory seconds or something but the first one I ordered the loungefly label was sewn on cricked and this one discolored scrapes in the pleather. I don’t know if I’m going to just keep or try another exchange. It’s not a common bag and I do love it. Just disappointed in the quality. Very unlike loungefly. I have a few of their bags.
2.0,"I liked the top but was disappointed that part of the ruffle was not stitched to the bottom. Cute, fit good, but don’t want to have to repair it."
2.0,"So, the strap looks good and is well made.  The major problem is that it does not ""grip"" the glasses, but will slip off.  Also the thickness of the strap makes it somewhat painful after extended periods. I would not be comfortable wearing in windy situations or on a roller coaster.  I am pretty sure it would fly off and you would lose the pretty strap AND your glasses."
2.0,It sound like a whistle….not a train whistle.. save you money
2.0,"Loved the big lens, hate bifocals. Need full lens magnifiers like this"
2.0,"This is not an easy product to use.  The snap feature is so tight that it is very difficult to separate the parts to get it on the hair to begin with.  Really need someone to help you with this - too hard to do on your own.  And several of the styles it says in the description actually require you to have two hairagami products, but you don't know this until you get the package at home and open it.  So, I paid more in shipping than the cost of the product itself, only to find out it is difficult to use, and I would have to have bought two of them to even do several of the styles.  I am keeping it only because I don't want to pay the shipping to send it back."
2.0,The fit of this dress is pretty much true to size. The color however was completely off from what I purchased. The photo of the dress I purchased was a very light almost pale pink. What I actually got in the main was hot pink with orange stripes running through it.
2.0,"This ran small, was somewhat tacky looking as far as coloring and very tight through the bust."
2.0,Cute but there's no underwear lining in pants. Swim cap doesn't stay on.
2.0,"Shoes are adorable but they don't fit, not sure if it's a sizing issue or the company can't seem to send the right sizes because many other reviews complain of the same incorrect sizes. I ordered a 7 and they sent me an 8 which was too big and the toe part kept falling off my 2 year old. Sending back because the toe box seems really short so when she is a size 8 I think her toes would be squished."
2.0,The waist band doesn’t stretch well at all I immediately heard the telltale tearing sound in the band trying to put them on. They run very small and don’t leave much room for error.
2.0,"Looks good, but Not true to sizes."
2.0,"Whir we know that we need to wear masks, none of us are enjoying doing so. That acknowledged, we want a unique ones. The bright flower does that, but rides up to the point that it goes up and into my eyes, even we it opened fully and pulled down under my chin.<br />To be returned. Bummer."
2.0,"Fit fine, but looks ridiculous on.  The sides at the bottom hang really weird and made me look really frumpy.  Returned it."
2.0,"Maybe I got one with a defective band, but yea band won’t lock so watch falls off wrist. Maybe I am putting it on wrong?"
2.0,"Size M, I am a pear, around 5’6” 140. Did not fit well, overall it was large. Waist is high and loose. Did nothing for my figure. Sleeves hit right below elbow, could have been an inch or do longer. I think this would fit better on someone with more curves."
2.0,"Very thin fabric. Shows everything. An odd cut, too. Works better as a dress than a skirt. Don't recommend unless you're pencil thin."
2.0,Great look and fit. The buttons are not sewn on well at all. All came off after first wash. The fabric is light but nice.
2.0,"Pretty dress, but the button popped off when I tried it on. I didn’t even get to wear it"
2.0,"It did come immediately, which was nice. Pretty easy to return."
2.0,Just spring for something better.
2.0,"The best thing about this is that it is cut a bit long, so there is enough length for your waist. In fact, given the listed size, I was able to create a new punch-hold for the belt to make it snugger. This is leather, and it's tough.<br /><br />The *only* thing I'd ding this for is that the belt-buckle edges are &#34;sharp.&#34; Not to cut you, but the corner is not forgiving. If the corners were just a little more rounded, that would be good.<br /><br />But it's certainly sturdy.<br /><br />ETA: downgrading this to 2 stars. May actually be less.<br /><br />Yes, it's a long belt and it can fit an average joe. But the coloring/dye of the belt is sprayed on somehow, and over time (about 2 weeks of use) the paint/spray/dye started flaking off. Now it looks just horrible with the big grey creases where there's no color in the belt."
2.0,It's cute but sizing is all wrong it was way to small and I got a size up from normal. Breast cups are super small as well not sure what they expect to fit in there. Overall very disappointed in the dress.
2.0,"I’m giving this dress two stars instead of one because it is designed well and is true to size. But the fabric is VERY thin - almost like lingerie. The top of the dress I ordered is white, so there’s no way I could wear this in public, even with nude undergarments. This would be a great dress if the material wasn’t so thin."
2.0,The crown that’s has the patch is much larger than the mess which causes it to be lopsided and even when worn.
2.0,It was okay.  Fabric was a little on the cheesy side (for me) and it was way too long.  I'm 5'6&#34;and 150lbs.  Overall the dress fit just not well.
2.0,"The size itself was ok, but this has zero styling to it! The material was nice and soft, but the back and front were just one solid piece. There was no tucking, or darts, it anything to make it FIT curves, so I kept tugging at it to try to make if work, but to no avail."
2.0,"The bag looks great. It's a sharp design and color, but if you have a curvy figure, this bag is extremely silly...basically excentuating your...top curves.<br /><br />Bet it looks very sporty and stylish on boys or the flat chested."
2.0,"Adorable suit and love the underwire but I'm a 12 and the large fit BUT you would have to have super little boobs. I think they must use the same bra for all sizes, it was tiny, super close together."
2.0,I hate to say this is not at all comfortable I’m just returning it
2.0,"Great material, but fits large and long."
2.0,"These looked like a casual pant that can be dressed up or down and so I thought they might be okay for my office job working with kids. However, they look and feel like cotton medical scrubs. There is nothing attractive or comfortable about these pants, much less stylish. Maybe I missed something in the description (?) but they are rough/scratchy with no stretch. They are definitely going back."
2.0,Very thin quality..would not recommend
2.0,"But there's something about this design which, once in the ear, looks a little clumsy and clunky. Maybe if they had some bend to their shape that didn't make it look like 2 flat slabs of metal gripping your ear...I don't know. It's just a little odd in person."
2.0,"The strap was very uncomfortable. Because they are narrow, they roll and cut into the skin."
2.0,Large bulky and does not wash well
2.0,Made small - waist is odd. White is  see thru - I’ll try to make it work but not worth the price.
2.0,"Cute dress in theory but just ridiculous. Doesn't cover anything, have to wear with shorts or mke a slip or something. I'm 5'4 so not that tall, and it wouldn't even matter, the wrap design is messed up! Unfortunate"
2.0,Nice jacket but buttons not securely sewn on. All 4 buttons feel off the first week! Fits well.
2.0,Okay my husband does not like it at all. He says it is two pieces of plastic that are kind of sharp on the edges so when you go to take the rubber band off it cuts into your fingers.  The two pieces then can just fall apart.  He thought it was really cool when he first got it but after using it for the weekend he did not like how when the band comes off it is now in 3 pieces.  He was not a fan of the lack of functionality of this item.
2.0,Material was nice but was not the teal/blue in the picture. It was more of a Ocean Blue and was not form fitting
2.0,"Arrived ripped... the entire bottom in the back was not attached.. it worked for a Halloween costume and fit well, but was very disappointed it had to be thrown away after that use."
2.0,"Love the shirt, too bad its so thin that there were strings hanging from the seams."
2.0,While the dress was alright i hand washed it in mild soap and cool water and couldn’t believe that it took me more than 10 times rinsing it and the water still turning purple and then I gave up and dried it on low heat tumbled... not sure I would recommend a friend
2.0,"Cheap material, somewhat see-through, but manageable.<br />I wore it to a wedding and got lots of compliments.<br />Has pockets.<br />Was expecting juniors or Chinese sizing, but this dress fits like a US women’s large. I’m 5’6”, 185lb and the XL fit loosely and was very long."
2.0,When I received this it looked very small. When I put it on the front is shorter than the back and one side is higher up than the other. The bottom looks like someone took scissors and tried to cut it and did a very poor job at symmetry. I use it as a work shirt because I don't really care if it gets dirty. It's poorly made.
2.0,too small for someone who is a bit bigger in the chest area
2.0,I really liked the watch when it came in.....first I couldn't get the strap to stay fastened then when I did it got stuck so I couldn't get it off.....that problem was solved today when the band broke off from the face..... straight to the trash
2.0,"They look great, but are put together with less than precision.  Any time I clean the lenses, they pop out, and i have to pop them back into the frame.  Less than ideal, but workable."
2.0,Would not stay on my feet.
2.0,"Returned. Too small, the design was really cute but the fabric was a rough cotton. Not soft at all. Plus it runs small. And I could easily imagine it shrinking."
2.0,Meh. I wanted to love this so bad. The top was awesome and supportive but the bottoms didn’t have much stretch and squeezed your stomach so it was not flattering
2.0,I was very disapointed! These are very small! i extended them to the full length and i still needed more! And i am not a big man by any means! These should be marked as boys! i will be returning them!
2.0,So so sooooo small
2.0,Dress ran longer in the torso area but smaller in torso diameter. Odd fit.
2.0,PRODUCT NOT GOOD
2.0,The wrist band was far too short
2.0,I received faded and duplicate colors
2.0,"They look almost nothing like the photo. In the photo, these look as though they cover your toes and have a heavier type of edging on them. They don't. I have a size 9 foot and they barely cover the toes and slip off my heel constantly. I have 10 pairs sitting in the package in my closet."
2.0,"I gave it 2 stars for look and fit which both are great. My daughter wore the jacket 2 times and the zipper broke. Now, im stuck with a brand new unwearable jacket."
2.0,"Looks beautiful, took big for my wrist though."
2.0,It’s ok. It will stick but it’s very hard to get it to stick. And it is pretty big. But works if you are just wanting to try it out.
2.0,"I normally wear a medium or large depending on the cut of the shirt.  To be on the safe side, I ordered Large.  Even the large was SO TIGHT, I could barely get it on or off.  I imagine after washing and drying the shirt, it will be completely unwearable.  BEWARE...  Order TWO SIZES BIGGER than your typical size."
2.0,"They Jimmy Orange stamped on left lens at bottom. I can't find way to get it off. Do not want to damage glasses.<br />The presentation on arrival was phenomenal. Hard box, great case, great looking glasses but.........<br />How can you wear glasses with Jimmy Orange stamped on outside of lens. Drove me nuts. Returning."
2.0,"A bit tight, but cute"
2.0,Not true to size; too loose all-round
2.0,"It DID NOT come with pins.  The description said it is ""Easy to install with included spring bar pins that slip into your watch lugs.""<br />This will require me to go to a shop to get it put on my watch.  Not totally pleased with that!"
2.0,Very uncomfortable and not really meant for larger busted women.
2.0,"The sizing was okay, but the top and sleeves were shorter than pictured (I'm 5'3""). The fabric and lace looked to be very low quality. I ordered it in black, and in red. I returned both for a refund."
2.0,It was 2sizes to big  but still very pretty
2.0,"I have 3 shirts just like this one (bright pink, bright green, and grey), that I really love, so I was really excited when I found it in blue. Much to my dismay, however, this shirt is nothing like my others. The material is completely different and the sizing is so much smaller. I figured that since it is the exact same shirt (design) that it would be the same, that could be my mistake. Unfortunately, I had to return."
2.0,"Don’t like the belt quality and won’t recommend, no worth the price"
2.0,"The price was in my range for something my daughter would wear 1- 2 seasons (currently size 13). No complaints from my daughter about being uncomfortable. I  have bought similar styled boots in the past. These scuffed up too easily in the toe area  and it looks like the top layer is peeling off. It's a gray color underneath. I probably would not buy these again because they don't look good enough to pass on to someone else, which I hate! Next time I will spend a little more and get real leather that won't scuff so easily or another brand that holds up better."
2.0,"The fit is great But the material is very sheer which causes the bra padding to visibly stand out. Unfortunetly, I would suggest buying another color or print.  the white floral is to sheer to wear out."
2.0,"It's ok...the layers get stuck and it looks cheap up close...From far away it looks pretty cute..I suppose for the price, it's okish."
2.0,"It was cute for the day that it lasted but on the second wear, both pendant charms at the end immediately broke off so I wouldn’t waste my money. There was no gold residue left on my skin tho so i guess there’s that."
2.0,"Overall the Sox were excellent. Over the last year, I bought 3 packs or 18 pair. My only disappointment was the length of use before they started developing holes is the lower back of the Sox. Of the 36 individual Sox, approximately 20 percent developed holes within 6 months."
2.0,I got them in size S/M and not L/XL as I ordered. The quality is good though.
2.0,I order blue color like on the picture they are navy blue !! I am dissapointed !!
2.0,"Rings break so easily, have to bend them super carefully. Loads of repeats too! Not all different like in picture"
2.0,"Off-gassing is terrible and causes headaches, burning eyes and rashes for everyone in the house, even a week after airing it out.  Horrid smell.<br />The purse itself is very cute and has lots of pockets and a very nice cloth lining.  I wish I could have kept it but the smell is just too strong."
2.0,"I ordered these because they supposedly had a great arch support and helped align your foot.  Well, after waiting over over 7 wks, my shoes came today.  Packaging was inferior, shoe quality was inferior and the arch supports are nil or none.  the shoestring decoration was strung up the same direction instead of mirror.  I put them on and went to the store.  My back is hurting and I feel like I have house shoes on.  Wouldn't recommend this vendor"
2.0,"Came with no instructions at all . Tried demagnetizing some tools  , it vibrated and buzzed , Tools are still magnetized  ..."
2.0,Looks cool but spring falls off too easily. I'm afraid I'm going to lose the rings out of my ear holes.
2.0,XL fits like a med/large. It you want the flowy effect as shown order 2 sizes up.
2.0,I thought I would like this but it’s either too tight or way too big.  Not a good fit for my wrist.
2.0,"The beads would strip if you tried to tighten them too much, making the ring useless, or I would have it on what I thought would be tight and it would fall off/ the bead would roll away hours later at an embarrassing moment. Also, I received more than I asked for, but not exactly what I asked for...<br /><br />Just not a good move on my part. i would not recommend. May not even last you through one event."
2.0,This item is very cute but it ripped on the sides as I tried it on. I guess you get what you pay for. It seems kind of disposable.
2.0,Flower is not centered but I’m not expecting much it was really cheap
2.0,"At least two sizes smaller than expected, and flimsier than other brands. Would not repurchase."
2.0,First off this is not the jacket I ordered. It is warm and does fit. But this is not what was advertised which so far is my only complaint.
2.0,Very short. Barely covers my panties
2.0,I bought several for my sisters and myself. After a few months it is now fading and dis-coloring. I am in the process of looking for other bracelets for my sisters and myself. I don't recommend them to anyone. The one thing that I do like is the idea of it. It could have been a great gift.
2.0,"You get what you pay for here. They are hard to install. The screws are cheap, too long and strip out before they tighten on your guitar. They are clunky and don't slide into the strap connect easily."
2.0,They were see through and too small.  Sent them back.
2.0,"This jacket seems like its well made and nice quality material.  I found the fit to be odd.  The sleeves are pretty long, but they're cut oddly so they feel very tight in the elbow, but loose everywhere else.  The body of the jacket feels very boxy and a bit too short.  It just seems like the proportions for this jacket are all a bit off."
2.0,"So cheap, broke the first day. Disappointing."
2.0,It looks like it could be nice but they didn't feel comfortable in it and plus they felt it was too much for the person and not true to size.
2.0,Much too large also more like bell bottoms not boot cut.
2.0,"Looks like a nightgown, feels like a nightgown.. Is it a nightgown? No, its suppose to be a dress, its definently not for large chested women.. I am a 32 D. I am 5ft 7in large framed and 200lbs. and it was too short."
2.0,"The hooks are too wide for the bra, so I can only use one hook instead of two."
2.0,Fit too small and the pleats unflattering
2.0,So bummed as I was excited about this dress however the flowers were unraveled so I had to return
2.0,"It's pretty poor quality and it's much, much smaller than advertised... It said I need an XL, but I don't think the XXL would even fit. I have a 50 inch chest and it doesn't come close to buttoning. The size chart says XL is 51.7, but it's probably off by about 3 inches... If you are looking to buy this for any sort of fun, definitely go a size or two bigger. And the sleeves are for very narrow as well, almost no room at all for larger arms."
2.0,would be nice to have had larger sizes available
2.0,"Love the material but runs really small to size. Need to return this item, no return label or instructions included."
2.0,"I ordered burgundy and a size XL (I usually wear a large-XL) and they arrived as a bright pink, very warm and thick (I ordered the ultra thin), baggy in the crotch and bell-bottoms pair of plastic pants. I wouldn't describe them as comfortable, fitted, breathable, or basically functional in most ways."
2.0,Scratchy on my face
2.0,"Nice looking, but to fragile, bends very easy and any tiny wind bends it backwards."
2.0,"Too small, not quite as described.  I'm returning the item.  Good for smaller or petite figures though!"
2.0,Wanted to love it but it runs too small (nice and long though).  I wear a 3x normally but there was no way this was fitting.
2.0,Its a good hat but way to small i woul not say its for toddlers.
2.0,Jacket fits perfect.  Vest and pants are way to tight. I wish I can return the pants and vest for a size up. Then it would be perfect
2.0,"This is a pretty yellow color, cute style. My main issue is that I order the size labeled ""9-10 years"", and received a size 130...which is for a 6 year old. I went back to check; added the 9-10 size to my cart, and in the cart it reflects this size and also size 130. (Therefore not user error, so beware the sizing) My other comment is that the top is almost a little sheer in the yellow, it needs to be lined. Maybe the darker colors are fine without the lining, but the material is a little thin, so some other colors may need lining or require another layer underneath."
2.0,They were smaller than expected with not a lot of give. There are lacy holes in them that make them kinda hard to pull on.
2.0,Cheaply made but good for one or two wears
2.0,"Fast delivery.  Very mild compression.  Would not buy again.  Pretty.  No stabilizing knee band, same fabric from top to toe,  causing top to roll down and cut off circulation."
2.0,Looks as described very pretty on me but the thread does not hold. when I eat the ball pops off no matter how tight I tie them.
2.0,"&#34;asian sizing&#34; 4x I got for my neice is the size of a normal american Large shirt, her mother who is a size 10 us pant is wearing this as a perfect fit, and the tag clearly says 4x. Otherwise though the shirt is beautiful."
2.0,Not made for average sized American women
2.0,Pattern and color is beautiful but the seams are defective and the fit is too tight even with ordering up.
2.0,"I like the bottoms because they are actually the right size, however, the top is weirdly shaped and doesn't fit correctly. Besides the actual style, the string the connects the top pieces broke the first time I tried it on! Would not recommend this."
2.0,They were used but I washed them. I just hate paying full price for used crap.
2.0,Zippers and other attached accessories fell off
2.0,The waist band is snug but the rest of the boxer is loose.
2.0,"Meh... Completely tarnished after 2-3 wears. None of them are gold anymore. They're either a gross brown or completely black. But hey, at least they're cheap!"
2.0,Color much darker than shown&spurs much larger than expected...
2.0,"Very cheaply made watch. Not worth the money, more like a $10 watch. Purchased it cause the dog picture on the face looks like my dog. You can barely read the words that go around the picture. Probably will return it"
2.0,Cant see pic very well
2.0,Looks absolutely nothing like the picture. It was a tight fit not a relaxed fit at all.
2.0,it is a little light weight for me .expected it to have a little more weight in the magnet  for the price.
2.0,I was very disappointed because the package was soaking wet and did not look like the purchase
2.0,Very cheap looking. Neck is streched out and after 1 wash the shirt looks 10yrs old. Waste of money!!! Overpriced as well!
2.0,Its way too expensive for how cheap it looks. I forgot to return it so now im stuck with it. Lace fabric is scratchy and the bottom fabric is stiff.
2.0,I was excited to get this dress since I don't have one in blue. The dress was too small and not flowy like other dresses are. The material seemed to be lycra-ish making it skin tight. I rather just give it to my sister and see how it fits her.
2.0,I wanted to love this jacket. Not waterproof at all. It got drizzled on and I was soaked immediately. Also looks rather cheaply made the strings stick off it and just not quality. It’s ok for a cheap wind proof jacket only. Has a plasticky sound when you move.
2.0,"I’ve had two pairs of these. One lasted months before the screw on one side kept falling out. I contacted the company and received 50% off a new pair. The new pair has lasted two months and the coating on the lens is starting to come off. Contacting the company again and they have a conflicting policy of 30 days money back guarantee and a limetime warranty. Not sure why my DEFECTIVE lens is not considered a warranty issue. I get that these are cheap sunglasses so I don’t expect them to last, but it’s the principle of false advertising that really irritates me. I won’t be buying from the company again."
2.0,"I thought it looked cool in the photo...but it really just turned out to not be my style. And on top of that, I've already lost it. Bleh."
2.0,"It fit funky.  I wouldn't buy, the pictures are deceiving."
2.0,Did not ship with t-bar
2.0,Item took a long time to arrive and smelled really bad even after washing it twice. I had to air it out before our daughter would even wear it. It is super cute though.
2.0,"This robe is super soft and adorable on my son. However, the proportion are completely wrong. The sleeves are so long that I have to roll up them up. It's also a very short robe reaching only the top of his thighs. A robe should at least reach the knee."
2.0,"These socks are adorable and I love that they have silicone all the way around the top plus silicone dots on the ball of the foot.  But they were way too small for me. I wear a size 9 and they were quite uncomfortable. I gave them to my 10 year old daughter who wears a size 5 and she loves them. Plus, one of the pairs had only one sock!"
2.0,The fabric feels ok but the brown looks like black
2.0,There is a lot more decorations to this top than I thought besides just the lace flowers. There also separate flowers on the collar with pearls in each one which is a bit too much for me. I got a large and the torso was too small and the sleeves are too short.
2.0,Not very nice. The material was nice but it just hung and didn't have a nice fit
2.0,To small and they deliver wrong color . the picture look white but it came cream
2.0,Color is gorgeous but can’t find a bra to wear that does not show. Gaps at the bust and too low in the back for a regular bra.
2.0,came unraveled withing a week of wearing it. switched to a different one and the same thing happened. They look and feel great just quality isnt there.
2.0,I usually wear medium fit and the medium was too too small! I have a very small bust and it could not fit around there neither were the arms.  This material is not stretchy either!
2.0,"I liked that they were simple and clean. But the wires are too big for the holes in my ears. I’m going to donate them to our fundraiser as they were so inexpensive, not worth returning over. I wished they did work for me, they are very cute."
2.0,Wouldn’t waste my money
2.0,it is very difficult to see the logo Choot'em on the tan color hat. Not enough contrast .
2.0,"The seam that separates the top and middle tier hits really weird, so if you have hops that are bigger than your waist it doesn’t fit!"
2.0,"I am not happy with them because they are so thick, itchy, and hot.  I thought they would be thinner and more comfortable"
2.0,Nice looking just too small Asian sizes
2.0,Wasn't too thrilled with this product. The material looks cheap and not quite what the picture looks like.
2.0,Cheap iron on sticker on the front of a very thin cotton shirt like material beanie.
2.0,"It lasted all of two weeks before it started to wrinkle and fall apart, but it was fun while it lasted."
2.0,This apron is made for a really thin person. It doesn't fit us wider gals (I wear a size 20). Plus it has an annoying strap in the back that bothers my shoulders.
2.0,"Bought these for my husband to use for shoveling and other outdoor chores. Despite looking like they would keep his hands warm and dry - they ripped after only one use.  Ripped at the seams in several places on both hands.  Please note these say Adult and not Mens. They definitely run small as well.  Fortunately, Amazon allowed me to return."
2.0,"You know how some t-shirts hide what needs to be hidden, and just make you look good due to a great cut?  This is NOT one of those t-shirts.  This one does a great job accentuating all of those places that you want to not be accentuated.  I probably will never wear this t-shirt. the color is fine, the neckline is good, the body cut is not flattering at all - it's the opposite."
2.0,The material is good but it runs big. It's deal for somebody who is size 6 and up.
2.0,I was constantly pulling the fitted leg part down because it rolled up. When I sized up they were too big.
2.0,"Received my dress today and I am returning it. I bought a size Large. I'm 5'5 and normally wear a size Large or 12/14. It was way too long on me. It came to the top of my feet. Even with my 3-4 inch wedges on, it was barely above the ground. The top of the dress came open on both sides of my chest, kind on the side of the breast, or underarm area. It's sort of a weird fit. Made me look really sloppy."
2.0,"I gave these to my grandson on Christmas Day.  He started wearing them to school on January 2.  He liked them, they were comfortable and he could wear them in school.....but the heel separated the second week of February.  He wanted another pair, I said, ""No Way!""  Unfortunately, I bought these on December 2 and my return window closed January 31."
2.0,Broke off the ring after a short time
2.0,"Is a bit smaller than expected, and length is short you can't really tuck it in."
2.0,"Before washing they fit from my hands to my elbows.  After a cold wash, they cover my hands and wrists.  I won't order these again."
2.0,This is not murano glass.  It's clear glass with navy and red painted on the back and then black is painted over those colors to conceal what the  &#34;artist&#34; did.
2.0,Quality issue. Band broke shortly after purchase. Glass face previously fell off but repaired with glue.
2.0,It’s WAY too big on me. There’s so much extra space in the armpits. I got a small but it fits more like a medium. The material also looks kind of like it’s made from a dish towel. I’ve had waffle pattern/texture shirts before and it didn’t look that way. It’s probably because it fits so poorly.
2.0,runs small  it says it was fleese  but was not  as I know fleese  just a other hoodie...
2.0,"Super cute top, however it fit horribly. the sides were way too large. going to have to pay more in alterations than what the shirt is worth."
2.0,It was cute when I bought it but the minute I put it on the jewel in the middle just fell off. It was literally glued together by a cheap glue so I had to re-glue it. Don't get me wrong this choker is cute but I wish it was a better quality.
2.0,"I will be honest enough to say I could not figure out how to make these work, and I certainly couldn't master the button."
2.0,"These gloves pretty much remind me of knee high socks that had the ends cut and sewn. They also piled and looked rough after the first washing. I wish I understood where they were coming from when I ordered them as I would not have, the wait on shipping was long"
2.0,"I'd give these a 1 star, but lenses themselves fit and work as clear lenses well....they do NOT change color when the sun comes out which is a real disappointment."
2.0,"This soft knitted hat has Bluetooth and led lights that are both rechargeables. The led light has three different light adjustments to choose from. And to recharge the light, I have removed the light from the hat and plugged the lamp into a USB outlet without any cords. The Bluetooth box also is rechargeable, but it has a cord that is needed to be able for charging. The Bluetooth is supposed to connect to your blue tooth devices; however, I couldn't get to work. I reach out to the company regarding the issue with the blue tooth but haven't heard back. The wire for speakers are fragile, and they are just stuck over the lip of the hat, which is kind of tacky. The light is nice, but you can not position the light up or down there is no way to adjust it. One size fits all, and this hat fits very tight, in my opinion; I could only wear it a few mins before it started to hurt my head."
2.0,No support. Rolls up under the bottom and sags a little on the side.
2.0,2 of them were  Crooked in the seams one arm  hole was as small as a baby's arm and other arm was bigger 2 of them are that way One of them looks perfect  the last 1 is OK  but could be sewed better  I am having my daughter a sleepover tomorrow so I do not have time to replace them I would deal with the ones that are OK and I am going to have to go to the store and buy 2 more
2.0,I'm 5'4 and this is very long on me.. also very large waist.
2.0,"I ordered these for an everyday earring and based on the other reviews, thought they'd be great.  When I received, I thought they looked very cheap and the CZ was so bright and too sparkly.  Moreover, after wearing for a day, my ears were infected, and I'm usually fine with sterling silver."
2.0,Stone fell out.
2.0,Looks nothing like the way model is wearing it. She must have on a dress three times bigger tha normal. I am so disappointed!
2.0,The shoes were really cute and my daughter was so happy. But she only wore them twice and the soles separated from the shoe and a hole wore through one of the toes.
2.0,"100% Rayon with a 100% Polyester Lining. WHAT a letdown and dishonest advertising. Dress is cute-ish...cheaply, poorly made. Sigh."
2.0,There was extra fabric down the front of the cardigan that made the front look horrible and the pockets just hung and showed at the bottom of the sweater. They needed to be sown on better. Would not suggest this sweater.
2.0,I ordered a XS but it fits more like a medium...too big but I can make it work for winter time.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:6d684ae4f41fecfb3fb9ac720d6fd54b]] The Baby Yoda graphics are cute but the band itself is cheaply made. Disappointed but will use it.
2.0,"this cap is too small for my 8 year old kid, and besides the material seems very thin, I do not think it will protect kid from sun very well. I returned it."
2.0,This shirt is Blue not the right color
2.0,"look good but poor quality, I have to remove it to see clearly or read my phone"
2.0,"Every pair of shorts that I own is XXL, and fits perfectly.  I ordered a pair of these in XXL, and couldn't even pull it up to my waistline.  If you typically wear a Large or XL shorts, order XXL in these.  If you typically wear XXL shorts, these ARE NOT FOR YOU!  Seemed to be of good quality, nonetheless."
2.0,"I ordered an xl which normally is a little loose, the way I like my Hawaiian shirts to fit.  It was to tight to be called a large which I wear in other shirts.  i will try a 2xl as I like the color and pattern and the cloth seems to be okay."
2.0,"I was so excited about getting my necklace and when I opened it, it was broken. If it wasn’t for that I would have loved it, the rope design is pretty and it looks sturdy. The size of the crystal is perfect."
2.0,I ordered a large because I already have a pair from a few years ago & that is a large. This one I ordered is way too small. The quality is nice I can't wear them so I gave it to someone who it fits. I don't think I will reorder.
2.0,Top is tight otherwise it would fit.
2.0,I dont have fake boobs so the opening was too big for me. My boobs were all over the place 🤣
2.0,"I ordered a size small, Pink leopard. It’s not pink! It’s more of an orange tan color. Fit is fine. I was so excited for this pink leopard print top…now it’s just ok to wear for work."
2.0,They feel like they shrink down during the day while wearing them and seem to get shorter. They are also not soft. I am disappointed - especially considering the price. I have bought cheaper brands that are superior to these socks.
2.0,"The small was more like an extra small. Also, the  trim on the chest and sleeves looks like an off-white or cream color to me in the picture (hich was part of the reason I liked it), but it's white in person."
2.0,"Camel toe. I should have known based on the advertising pictures of the pink ones but was hoping for the best and gave them a try anyways..... nope the advertised picture was spot on- major camel toe.<br />I gave two stars because they are comfortable, soft material but more like leggings and not suitable for running or working out. I would ONLY wear them in public if my shirt was long enough to cover my butt/crotch area."
2.0,All polyester and you can tell. Clingy and non-summer material. Cute patter but that is it. Not for gals with hips like me. More for those without hips (straight) figure.
2.0,Doesn’t always scream when introduced to light. Sometimes will scream randomly. The button works but would not but this again
2.0,Cheap. Very thin and the cups to the dress is very small and No matter the size
2.0,"I have 2 issues with this earring set. 1.These very tiny earrings can almost fit through my ear piercings (which although not brand new piercings, are also not stretched out holes). 2. The teardrop design is constantly spinning around, (which really bother me when they're all different directions) & I find it very difficult to get a hold of them to turn them right side around. Although these are sterling silver & I do normally like small stud earrings, especially for my 2nd ear piercing, it's just not worth the hassle of wearing them. Money wasted."
2.0,"Not the color I ordered but kept anyway because my son liked it, jacket is nice but be careful when ordering I ordered white/navy and got white/navy/red as seen in default picture."
2.0,"Cute but oversized.  Have an extra 2 inches hanging under the chin. So does not create anywhere near a seal,  covid can creep in underneath."
2.0,Cute but not very comfortable on the top ear.
2.0,"Wasn't a fan of it when I saw it in person. It isn't Pink it is more Mauve. I would have sent it back but, they charge you to do that since the Amazon option place isn't close. I will think very hard next time I purchase."
2.0,Wanted this to be slouchy. Not the case with this one. It just stands straight up. I would reccomend looking elsewhere if what you want is a slouchy beanie.
2.0,looked more pink in the picture and it was more tan and light brown
2.0,too light weight for what I needed
2.0,"I am 5'3&#34; 135 pounds - size 4-6 pants & size S-M shirt - athletic build<br /><br />I got this shirt in a M and while it fits, it is a little snugger than I like but still looks good. The reason for the low rating is the material. It feels like cheap, children's pj's and it is itchy. It is also see thru"
2.0,"This shirt is poorly made. For example, there is no seam along the neckline. The fabric has a raw edge. This causes the edge to keep turning out, visibly, when the shirt is worn, so that the shirt looks cheap and unfinished. Other problems are caused by the poor construction, as well. At $35 this shirt is ridiculously priced. I can buy similar shirts, but of better quality, all day long at TJ Maxx and Marshall's for $9 to $13."
2.0,"Stitching could be better but overall made decent for the price. The material is thin. I ordered the burgundy so the dark color is not see through other than where body jewelry is but I anticipate the pink would be easy to see through. I ordered a size large. I'm 36-24-37 and it fits on the waist, bust, and hip in an appropriate way but the shoulder to crotch distance is incredibly too short and I expected a large to fit a bit looser that what it does overall."
2.0,"These are so cute, but the quality is terrible. The fabric split from the soles the first time my daughter wore them ☹"
2.0,"So, I'm guessing this is supposed to be a dupe to the old Victoria Secret one... I had the white one from VS a few years ago and loved it, so I decided to buy this because the design looked exactly the same. But be warned, it's not. The fabric is pretty thick for a nightie. The lace on the chest is meh, and the ribbon running through it is cheap, it ripped off pretty easily. I didn't like the adjustable straps because the fabric was so thick that it would roll and twist inside that little plastic thing. Overall, it was a mediocre purchase. I'm sure it'll last me a while, and since I only sleep in it, it will suffice."
2.0,"Beware that these are not a linen blend, and do not put in dryer even on low. I bought 2 colors and they shrunk.  The texture is a little itchy in hot weather. I wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,The tie in the front bulges out and makes you look thick around the middle. Color is not very appealing.
2.0,Unfortunately I'm returning these earrings. They look lovely but I've got very sensitive ears & these earrings irritated them. The earrings arrived on time though. I think the seller is great but the product won't work for me.
2.0,Corre muy grande y corta.
2.0,The cups where way too small.  I ordered a 36G which I pretty much order in all my bras and it was tight.  I was popping out.
2.0,"I got these bracelets with high hopes.  I can't even adjust one of them because the strings are all jumbled up, it isn't going to even be able to be worn.  I'll keep it because for 2 of them it was 10 bucks.  I'll wear the one that works.  Otherwise, it's cute.  Just poorly made."
2.0,The light-up unit is defective and the batteries were dead but I bought it for the style and color so it's a wash. I'll wear it anyway. Just very disappointed.
2.0,I’m a size large but this was way too small. Returning but I would have went with a XXL.
2.0,Looks nice but my husband said it's a little sharp so he is afraid to put on his key ring. Will try to smooth the edges a bit.
2.0,Product states that it is suitable for men and women.  Product fits women and children just fine.<br />Product reach from top of nose to point of chin.<br /><br />Had to find a larger mask
2.0,The top came in XL and the bottom was the correct size.
2.0,Skimpy and much too small even as a large.
2.0,Did fit to size.. order the next size up
2.0,"I have been purchasing this sweatshirt for many years, and for a long time when I purchased replacements, the quality was consistent. However, in the last 5 years or so, the quality has gone downhill rapidly. I returned this recent purchase for poor quality, which is a first. Apparently, it is an end of an era for Russell's great quality sweatshirts. Bummer."
2.0,"It would be an excellent product, except for the fact that it rolls up continuously whenever I sit down. When it rolls up, it's both uncomfortable and makes my waist area look weird. I find myself always having to readjust it, and that's really awkward in public. Not good."
2.0,"Went a size up after reading other reviews, Dress was too big . Material is pretty but cheap looking. It advertised Free<br />Returns for any reason, when I contacted seller to return-they sent a return label I would have to pay for. After<br />several attempts to get them to honor what they advertised, I gave up and will just keep the dress. Buyer Beware!!"
2.0,Cute but need to size up
2.0,Returned these because they were WAY too small. Should have ordered at least 2 sizes larger than the sizing chart said.
2.0,One of the 2 of the black pair came “I welded” and he first time I wore them.  😔
2.0,"These are scratchy, uncomfortable and run very small. We ordered 5x and they are really about a 2x."
2.0,"I have large breasts so I wanted a suit with underwire  support, however, after just one day, the wires were poking thru the fabric and digging into my armpits!"
2.0,Review said to order next size up but sleeves are about a foot to long!
2.0,Color isn’t as advertised. Definitely not something I would wear. Re-gifted it.
2.0,Love the fit of the Longitude brand and super cute but the metallic brush strokes are peeling off after 2 wears
2.0,this isnt even a ring its literally a peice of wire with a crap heart on it.  its not worth more than 25cents and is a total rip off. i dont recommend it.
2.0,They should adjust the size range.  Getting these on/off are a chore if you're a US/12.
2.0,"Runs small, too bulky, can’t bend fingers"
2.0,Flimsy the frame broke
2.0,Brown color doesn't match the picture. Also feels like cheap plastic. The buckle is nice.
2.0,Pretty earrings but the threading on them is crap. I spent 30 mins trying to unscrew one so I could clean my piercing and ended up having to break out my pliers to get the back off.
2.0,Although it looks good. Built nicely. But the main problem is the magnet is not strong enough. Every now and then it becomes loose. Not a good product.
2.0,Doesn’t stay latched.  Spend a few more dollars and get a better one.
2.0,"Extremely thin. If you want light weight and see through, this might be the product for you.  Keeping it because my Mom hangs out in her room  so these work."
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap. Will break on a key ring in no time at all.  Plastic.
2.0,Ordered 6 multi pack gowns in 3 xl ( I ordered these from another vendor prior to this order that came in just right dimensions ). The gowns were way too small. Size should have been maybe a large.  Very disappointed and do not recommend buying for I’m this vendor!
2.0,"Runs large. Low cut, definitely need a cami underneath. Also super clingy. Overall not pleased."
2.0,Photo led me to believe the writing was in black or dark wording. Bracelet came and writing is same color as metal. Very hard to read.
2.0,String broke first time wearing it
2.0,"Too baggy. A Medium seemed to swallow me and the sleeves were almost too short. The color is off too. Not like advertised, I am build about the same as the model and it just doesn’t look right on me."
2.0,The mesh us so big it even cover your eye area so you cannot see
2.0,"Only thing wrong with this tie is that it is too short. Should have tried it on before my event. Would have returned it if I had. I am 5'11"". Maybe if you are shorter it will be okay."
2.0,"It fits great, but my only problem it the cup size. I bought this based off of my cup size ( 42DDD so a xxl) and it was like wearing 2 sizes to small. But other than that, its fitting and cute."
2.0,"Order your usual size, or one size smaller.  It's a thin coverup/dress, and the design isn't high quality, but it will last a summer or even two with care."
2.0,Nice for the price. It tangles very easily.
2.0,ACABAMENTO PESSIMO
2.0,"This chain was so small, it actually fit perfectly on my 3 year old child. I was expecting the chain to be longer"
2.0,Although this dress had a great fit the material was really weird like spandex with a sheen. Very cheap feeling and the stitching was messed up in certain places so I returned it.
2.0,"I purchased this 3/4 bell sleeve dress for my daughter in size medium and for myself in size XL, and according to it's specs. It is very pretty and soft. However, this dress is too sheer even with the lining, and the sleeves run tight. I returned both dresses in the same box I received them in. Let me add that the one I ordered for myself in size XL arrived as a size medium and without any sleeves, so I never tried it on. I received and email January 16 promising me a refund for only one of the dresses and without mention of the second dress in the box. I responded to that right away, but have not gotten a reply. It is February 7 and I still have not received the refund promised to me in that email dated January 16, three weeks ago."
2.0,Way too small. Could see belly button through fabric. If you are wanting every curve to be on display this is the dress for you. Pretty color though.
2.0,The coat is thin and looks cheap. More like a wind breaker.
2.0,It fits too snugly for me to wear.  I'm a guy with a large frame and belly and this doesn't work for me.
2.0,"I am 5&#34;1' and this did not work for me at all unfortunately.  It was much too long, and the slit went down to my mid-calves. I saw someone else wearing this who was taller, and it looked fine on them."
2.0,So had I have known prior to the party I would have returned and got another. I ordered 2 and the first one filled up great no problems and looked awesome. The second had a hole in it and I had to improvise and use clear shipping tape to make it last 2 hours. So make sure you inspect your ballons. Especially if your going to spend that much on a balloon
2.0,The material is alot different than I expected it to be. Its a thick cotton with a slight stripped pattern due to how its stitched. I had to return these because the crotch is way to low. You cant pull them up very high and everytime you bend over they pull down past your butt. Very odd fit which is too bad because the style is cute.
2.0,"My wife is 5'10&#34; and this did not work out for her.  The length is quite long, but almost too much. We are going to return this due to short sleeves. It was like high waters on her arm."
2.0,"After washing, this shirt was literally 2-3 sizes smaller. Unable to wear now and of course unable to return due to being washed already. Not happy at all<br />Poster was nice though."
2.0,The X-large for this is equivalent to a girls small - this women's xlarge top would not even fit a preteen. I would not recommend this product - it is cute but the quality is not great and the sizing is absolutely a joke - I couldn't even try to upsize this since the sizing was so off
2.0,"Cant see a thing with them, threw them out"
2.0,Bigger than expected. Cheap looking and very thin material
2.0,I have ordered this cute top multiple times trying to find one that fits.  Up size or down did not work.
2.0,These ties are AMAZING but my tie holder looks like Casper the friendly ghost because it's NOT in my package. So I took 3 stars away.
2.0,The necklace isn’t the color shown in the picture. If you’re looking for burgundy or close to it don’t purchase this product.
2.0,ordered an XL but way to small runs very small
2.0,The reviews said it would fit a 6 foot man and it did not.  It was made more for a smaller person
2.0,Poor support straps too long to provide good support and overall mediocre quality
2.0,"It was way too tight around my wrist and not just my wrist, but the wrists of several female friends.  It is cute - I will use my as a tie around my ponytail."
2.0,Pretty disappointed in these. I'm keeping them because I did not plan on wearing them where people could see them. They will be hidden. The edges are frayed. They are not sized the same. I added a couple photos to show what I mean.
2.0,"Keeping in mind they are inexpensive, I wasn't expecting the fabric to be quite so thin.  If you are modest and plan to wear this outside your home you will want a good bra.  It is quite revealing, if you know what I mean."
2.0,Dress did not fit right. Too tight in waist but big in bust. I was not able to return at Kohls as I have always done.  I will be very careful about ordering clothes from Amazon in the future.
2.0,Very good looking watch however the quality is poor. The actual wood is not good quality so the small metal rod that holds the strap on the watch over time has rubed against the wood and the strap won't stay on. I've had the watch for about two months now I can't wear it because the strap won't stay on. Save up a little more money and buy a different watch.
2.0,They are very flimsy.  My daughter said I looked like a bug.  They took up more than half my face and I have a long face.  Had to return.  For the price they are ok- but kind of like fair quality
2.0,I love the Rings. Little small but beautiful color probably won't last too long because it's already fading after a week but the price wasn't bad and got them really fast.
2.0,"Small and disappointing, not everything has been delivered."
2.0,Very cheaply made. I have bought this dress in other colors and it didn't look this way so not sure if this just was a defected one...the sleeves were longer than the other dresses I ordered and had strings coming off like it was coming unraveled.
2.0,"OK this is the third Naviforce watch that I have purchased.  Two I got from the Naviforce store site.  This one is from an Amazon seller.  The two from Naviforce work very well.  These are nice watches, keep time accurately and when needed the back light is bright.  But not this one (9128).  The quartz movement is japanese, but the watch is from China.  The appearance is very nice and all the functions other than the backlight work well.  The band on this watch is a heavy top grain leather, and I found it to be hard to fasten the buckle.  I am giving this only two stars primarily due to the issue with the backlight issue, and the very unresponsiveness of the seller.  Unlike other sellers on Amazon I found this seller to be very uninterested in hearing any problem or issue with the watch.<br />His response to a non functioning backlight was to inform me that it has luminescent hands.  In follow up messages I was informed that he gets the watch from Naviforce and it works, not accepting any responsibility for any malfunction.<br />My advise is to avoid purchase of this product."
2.0,The coat I received has to be a X-Large because it is not a small
2.0,Weird fit. Sleeves are short.
2.0,No good.  These slippers leave heavy black scuff marks on floor
2.0,The boots are comfy enough but it looks alot cuter in the pic.
2.0,The top is a crop top nothing like the picture.  The pants fit great.  The material is a sweater super hot not for New Orleans weather.  I had to return.  Im a size woman 16 and bought a 2xl .
2.0,Poor quality.  The elastic is weird.
2.0,Vendor was good. Delivery on time. Packaging was fine. However the cap seems to run a bit small. And it is a lot thinner than I had expected or hoped. Very thin. My brother won't even wear it because it's so thin. But for less than $4 I guess I shouldn't have expected a thicker cap.
2.0,"They are really pretty! But the clasp/ post is a blade shape. And unless you are a very old girl with super saggy ear holes, you ain’t putting these in your ears.  So a 2 star review"
2.0,"I bought them, and they are very nice looking. Very modern fit!  But the zippers are horrible, they really need to change those.  MOst of the time my wallet would be trapped in the zipper and I would have to pull apart the zipper to take it out.  If they improved the zipper I would put 5 stars and buy a few more."
2.0,"Heavy,  hot,  smushes your nose and keeps slipping off head"
2.0,I am a US size 10-12 so I ordered an XL after reading the reviews.  It's STILL too small!  The actual dress looks NOTHING like the picture on here.  I will keep and pass on to my sister simply because it isn't worth returning.  But do yourself a favor and keep looking; don't order this dress.  Also - I won't order anything again that says it's coming from China- just not worth it.
2.0,"I saw this online and thought it would be perfect for my 30th wedding anniversary outfit (pearls for 30 years) however, when I got it I was surprised by how big they actually were! Don't get me wrong, they are beautiful rose/pearl/zirconia earrings but I don't like to wear large earrings. I contacted the seller and they were quick to respond to my request and said they would refund the full amount back.<br />I love the look but not the size - if they had been smaller I would have kept them. I would still buy items from this seller because they were quick to mail them to me and respond to my dissatisfaction of their product."
2.0,The color is not bright and cheery enough for Christmas  as I thought it might be. Looks faded
2.0,"I really wanted to love the shorts that fit was great the little Ruffle was super cute, but before I made it out the door The fabric split from but to waist.<br />Now I am generously proportioned in the rear so this could’ve been user error - so just buyer beware- don’t do your bend and snap until you’ve had them on for a test run"
2.0,The product looked a lot better in the picture online. The actual shirt looks more like a ladies t-shirt or  men's pajama shirt.
2.0,"I loved this blouse!  It's lightweight and flows and I love the way it hangs.  The colors are great. Before ordering, I measured myself and ordered according to their sizing chart.  When I got it, it fit great.  Until I washed  and dried it.  IT SHRANK A LOT and now it doesn't fit.  Order a size bigger than what the sizing chart says."
2.0,"I thought this mask would look like a pleasant smile, but the proportions are not right.  And the mask is very big.  But I get a lot of people smiling, laughing, thumbs-up, beeping, so I like that."
2.0,"Arrived just as pictured, but the closure broke right before wearing it but it was really prettty & the delivery was very long but it complimented my outfit nicely even with my rigging up the closure"
2.0,"This flip flop looks lovely and gives the accupressure well. However, the straps broke very quickly. I had hardly used  it and the straps on both the flip flops broke ☹️"
2.0,The large piece broke by the wheels wrote to the seller twice because of warranty they never responded
2.0,I have small wrist and even with the adjustment its too big.
2.0,Uncomfortable.  Very stiff
2.0,"These are the standard Hanes cushion crew socks that they are making now. I bought them because the photo shows these to be the red line socks, with the red line across the toes---those were the best Hanes sock for both cushion and fit. These socks do not include the red line like the socks in the picture and are looser and less cushiony than the earlier line. I guess the red line socks are not available, so if you happen to be liking for those specific Hanes socks, probably best to try a different brand and keep your fingers crossed."
2.0,fit like a boys T-shirt not mens whatsoever.
2.0,Silver belt came in broken. Screws were missing from the leaf so there was no way to close it.
2.0,Not the advertised length. A medium falls too short on my 5 foot tall wife. If your wife is average height or above look somewhere else entirely.
2.0,The seam ripped once I unzipped it.
2.0,"I like that the moon is big, but it doesn't really glow as bright. You can't tell it glows😭"
2.0,Love you up at the sizing seems to be off
2.0,These earrings are so thin that no one can see me wearing them. If you have long hair than forget it. If you are not a blonde than forget it. They are the thinnest earring I have ever seen. Not recommended.
2.0,They are super cute but ridiculously small. Not even close to the size they're supposed to be.
2.0,"I ordered a white shirt, but received a very pale pink shirt. Not the kind of pink that is intentional, but the pink that happens when you wash a white item with a red item. I noticed the pink tint immediately upon opening the package, but I decided to try washing it myself - did not help. Also this shirt is really huge, far bigger than other shirts of the same size, and it suffers from one of the common problems of larger women's clothing sizes - enormous arm holes. After a few washings, the material stiffened up a bit, so it's not as comfortable anymore and I rarely wear it. I would not purchase again."
2.0,"Junk. Cute for show but you can't see thru them. Fuzzy, milky."
2.0,"This is a nicely made shirt that fits great but I don't understand why the graphics on it are fractured (see picture) If it's a ""company"" ID thing for Organic Signatures...its a lame one...all the ""fractures"" in the graphic, make the shirt look old and worn out, not new and good looking !!<br />I won't be buying anything from them..."
2.0,Cute but really short. Had to return.
2.0,Once you get hit in the face the cool plastic that has that color gets scratched and begins to strip away. I recommend just stay with the clear ones.
2.0,The blue was way longer and higher in the waste than expected. The black was to small. The material is also really thin. Not see through but cold.
2.0,"Very, very thin material but can easily be worn over a thicker mask. Shipping took nearly a month to US from overseas."
2.0,Bend very easily and some had holes in them.
2.0,"Sorry, but these sunglasses do MORE HARM than good. In fact, I only worn them 2 or 3 times before my Eyes HURT ME!! Colors are NOT as they SHOW!!"
2.0,How can I remember which piece I purchased the warranty for? Please help clarify this.
2.0,"Loved this when I received it and used it everyday with my watch, started to stretch out and eventually broke apart. If it would last longer for the price then I would buy again but I’m not gonna waste my money again."
2.0,"I felt they were not the quality I was hoping for, and to boxy to look very nice for an adult.  Best for younger girls."
2.0,links too large had to return
2.0,Shape is more like a T-shirt straight to the floor. No body to it.
2.0,I loved the color and sheen to this dress however the material was very scratchy and itchy and did not fit well in the bust area. The dress was very long and even though I wore heels with the dress I still found myself tripping over my dress and having to hold my dress up to walk.
2.0,"The product i got was not the same as the picture, the fabric feels cheap, i tore a hole in it within the first week of having it and all i wear it for is pajamas, but its very comfortable and fits kinda nice so its eh"
2.0,too small and  short
2.0,Fit as expected but the stamped was poor as a quality.
2.0,Really really big in sizing compared to other brands in the same size
2.0,I was expecting a white shirt but it was cream color.  Had to return.
2.0,I was expecting to love this but it was too small. Definitely size up! Style is still super cute though!
2.0,"My daughter wore these once for just 2 hours. The material is very delicate and probably not meant for 4 year Olds. I don't recommend this purchase for young kids, waste of money."
2.0,Had to return this it looked nothing like the photo like not even close. Very disappointing. Scratchy uncomfortable fabric. Very ill fitting in the sides. And the stitching is like.. beige mustard color not cute
2.0,flimsy and not really what i was expecting
2.0,Ridiculously short.
2.0,"These earrings look almost exactly like a certain designer's glitter-filled earrings but since these were a fraction of the cost, I decided to try them out. Surprisingly, the size was fine and as expected- probably the exact same size as the aforementioned designer's, which was a relief as I thought these might be much larger in person. However, the earrings themselves are not &#34;shiny or gleaming&#34; as they claim in the description and show in the pictures- they were surprisingly just filled with glitter, and seemed as it it was almost missing a top coat (if you touch the middle you can literally almost feel each individual glitter chunk). I don't really mind the lack of shine, I am just worried that the glitter particles might fall out because nothing is holding it in.<br />Once I took them off the cardboard backing and tried them on, I noticed a slight grey ring on the white cardboard the earrings had been on, which is most likely due to tarnishing. These earrings are described as stainless steel, which would definitely tarnish or leave a type of ring around your ear after wearing them, but since these are rose gold colored, I did not expect to see this happen literally right after I took them out of the package.<br />The earrings are surprisingly not heavy at all, so they are comfortable, and they are pretty for wearing for a special occasion possibly. They do sit slightly awkward on the earlobe, as they are large, and seem to twirl even when the back is securely in place.<br />Overall, I am not sure if they are worth the ~$10 I paid, as they are already showing signs of tarnish, so I doubt they would last me very long (maybe 1 or maximum 2 wears). I am definitely disappointed in the quality, as I hoped these would be an affordable alternative to the expensive designer studs these resemble. I am probably returning these as I do not feel that they are worth the price I paid for them...if they were about half the price, I would probably just keep them."
2.0,"Very nice, but it broke after 2 wears. The clasp just fell off! And I handled it with kid gloves bc other reviews complained about it breaking"
2.0,It’s cute but it fits very small (go 2 sizes larger) and it’s extremely thin fabric. Not warm at all
2.0,You can not text with these gloves I feel a bit let down
2.0,it didnt fit
2.0,"Fabric is very thin and clingy, as well as see through so not flattering and would require some type of under garment, making it not comfortable for hot weather."
2.0,Fabric is not %100  cotton  pretty  but  I can not wear it mire then 15 min very disappointed
2.0,"The shirt is beautiful,  however, after wearing it once my husband complained of a strange odor coming from the shirt. We ordered another one, same brand, and it stunk also."
2.0,"I hand dyed play silks for my daughter, but I wanted to see how a Sarah’s Silk would match up. (After hearing sooo much about them) This silk is shinier, but mine are softer. Other than that they are pretty much equal. The hand dyed silks cost less and it was a lot of fun to dye them. There are some things that Sarah’s silks make that I can not and I will definitely be buying them from this company, just not anymore of these silks"
2.0,"First, the arrival date was a week late. The mask does not look like what is advertised on Amazon. The letters are extra large spanning across my face and it looks awkward because it is so large. Disappointed!"
2.0,"This is a joke, cheap looking but you get what you pay for. Looks like it’s for a costume. Save your money."
2.0,The quality is cheap and the lock doesn't close tight and light weight
2.0,"I'll keep this as it's for a Halloween costume and will see maybe 4-5 hours of wear, but the quality is disappointing to say the least. The faces of most of the larger gemstones are scratched and in poor condition. Not worth the money."
2.0,"The bag is great, however the inside pattern that arrived on my bag didn't have the pattern instead it had little roses, I'm not a flower person I'm so I found the inside rather ugly ."
2.0,"Pretty and tiny. We love them, but 4 pairs either had one or both atone loose when we got them."
2.0,It was cute but not for me. No support!!
2.0,Took a long time to get and I'd way two small. Doesn't wind around wrist three times like in photo and twice is way two big.  I a small guy so should have wrapped three times. Disappointing
2.0,"I love AC / DC and wanted this mask. However, if you can blow out a candle while wearing the mask, then it is not actually protecting you. I just blew out TWO candles while wearing this mask. I don't think I will wear this mask outside since it wont actually offer any protection. but it looks damn cool"
2.0,"These fit weird, the upper back area is too loose and the torso area is too tight. Would not buy these"
2.0,Order up at least two sizes if you want it to fit loose like the photo. I ordered up one size and it fits but not loose at all. I gave it two stars because it is cute but sizing is just way off.
2.0,"These are not kid size, they are not even adult size.  They are not any lighter weight than other products: still fogs you glasses and makes face sweat."
2.0,"Product kept falling off during graduation, never stood in place for pictures, and was overall a nuisance."
2.0,"It's just an ""okay"" shirt, and doesn't look like the picture.  It is NOT really very loose fitting.  I ordered a large, and it is only slightly larger -- maybe 2 inches of extra width, so it fits pretty much like your regular size.  It is given the ""oversize"" look by using a drop-shoulder cut and putting a larger size on the model.  The shoulder seam is about 2.5"" lower than normal.  The picture shows a soft, flowy, almost gauze-like material.  It is not soft, and is actually a little stiff, made of crinkly, wrinkled cotton, although the description says ""no wrinkles"".  It is described as not being see-through, but if you're wearing a dark-colored bra under a light-colored shirt, it WILL show through.  Also, it is NOT a V-neck shirt, but a standard, button-front and is shorter than expected.  It is unbranded, with no neckband label, only a small side seam tag that says ""100% cotton/made in China"".  I would expect to see this item in a thrift store.  On the plus side, it seems to be well sewn.  If you really want the oversize look, order up a size or two.  I am very disappointed in the overall quality and would not reorder."
2.0,My son were size 5. These shoes did not fit and one of the shoes was slightly damaged.
2.0,I returned this bag. I own two other Dooney bags and the quality of them are exceptional! I didn't like the feel .......it was just way too thin and hard.
2.0,"These shoes fell apart in every which way in less than 2 weeks!! I bought 2 pairs, one for each of my twin boys. Both pairs were falling apart. Returned."
2.0,Didn’t experience the comfort level I had hoped for. I stand up to 13 hours on my job. 4 days in these shoes made taking small steps agonizing on the heels of my feet. The search for comfort continues on...
2.0,Chain looked cheap.  Pearls were overall not too bad.
2.0,So tiny!  Should have looked at the dimensions.  It’s about the size of a Quarter!
2.0,Not as elegant as it looks in the picture.
2.0,These goggles are fine for swimming laps but cannot be used in competitive swimming as they come off with a dive.  Both pairs respond the same way.
2.0,Looks cheap with white inside. No stretch whatsoever but fits as expected.<br />Got a medium.
2.0,"I had originally given the jammies 5 stars.  I purchased 2, they are very comfy and light weight, no pockets.  After washing a couple of times they look like I've washed them 5000.  I found a hole in the first set, the company replaced.  Found a hole in the second pair. Fortunately I was still within a return period for this.  I'm stuck with one pair which you guess it, has another hole in the crotch."
2.0,Wore the pants maybe 10 times and they ripped in the butt/crotch area and not at a seam.  Very disappointed!
2.0,I waited too long to return these. The lenses are fine but I can only fit one side over my ears.
2.0,"I like how cute this necklace is, but I wanted it for myself, and it's more a young adult type necklace as it's pretty thin and small, dainty for sure. I wish this was in a bigger size, I'd get it, but since it is not, I'd recommend more for a teenager than an adult."
2.0,"This product is ok but I would not buy it again. As you polish, it leaves tarnish on your fingers and takes a lot of work to clean jewelry."
2.0,The straps are made out of an odd fabric and slip.
2.0,Super cute! WAY too small!
2.0,It is Asian size.  I ordered a large and couldn't zip up the zipper its pretty but wish it was bigger
2.0,The socks are nice. However the elastic band around is too tight.
2.0,I was pleased with this bracelet until the ties came loose and the beads fell off after wearing it once.
2.0,"Arrived quickly but not quite what I expected.  Definitely smaller than the size indicates.  Maybe since it is a loose knit. it might stretch more but I can just imagine it would shrink in the wash.  Not taking a chance and returning it not only because the sizing but the feel.  It is not comfy.  I would not want to feel this against my skin all day.  Again, maybe after washing it with some fabric softener, it might improve but I'm returning it."
2.0,Product just arrived today and it’s falling apart and seems worn. I needed it for a wedding this Saturday. I bought the green one a while back and it was amazing but I am so disappointed with the quality of the burgundy one 😕
2.0,It's not green jade - very disappointed
2.0,The rose pattern at the bottom is very uncomfortable on the balls of your feet when wearing heels. And they tore at the seams after 2 wears. And they slip at the heel in flats. Not very useful for me at all.
2.0,"Looks good, until it turned my neck green! You get what you pay for. Oh well lol"
2.0,The dress is beautiful however the arms are cut really small compared to the size dress that was ordered.
2.0,They are not bell bottoms.
2.0,"I know ""spandexie"" material is snug and super tight, so I even went up a size. Too small. I got the shorts on but I was afraid I'd rip seams! Very cute design in the back with the x design."
2.0,Meh. Not functional. I wouldn't get here for a mobile baby at all.
2.0,"can't really expect much more from the price but for riding, its better to spend the money for quality. I pulled over and had to take them off."
2.0,"Hello.<br />The fit is great and the color but the fabric is bad, I just use it once and its riping apart where the stiches are.<br />Has to get better fabric."
2.0,"The costume is great, super cute, however, the sizes are awful. I wear a 6 and it's all I could do to get it over my head and chest. I'd have much rather had a size up and it be a bit big."
2.0,The straps that hold down the band do not stay in place so I’m having to slide/adjust them pretty much all day<br />Also lags in time and have to change it often
2.0,Had to return as they were too short.
2.0,Pretty but in arms is so small
2.0,The headbands were much thinner and not near as absorbent as what I expected.  Individuals ones that I purchased from K-Mart and Wal-Mart were much thicker and absorbent.
2.0,the sleeves on this are just plain ridiculous
2.0,It broke after wearing it one week
2.0,"Pjs are cute, but I wouldn't consider them ""blanket"" fabric - very thin."
2.0,Sized up. Still too small. Even though I ordered my measurements using their size chart. Disappointed.
2.0,"Disappointed the Beanie arrived broke.  I purchased 4 LED beanies for our family Christmas drive thru ""The Elf on the Shelf's Magical Holiday Journey light Show and only 3 members had workable LED hats.  Pro: The beanie is super stylish and fits cute, wish it didn't have bad wiring.  I was able to return the hat free of charge and refunded full amount."
2.0,Bought this for decoration on our mantle for Halloween. It was thin and falls apart. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Needs to be longer.
2.0,"This dress is 1000 percent see through. I put on a slip which was fine except it was large on me. I am a 34DD, 5'2&#34; hourglass shape and it was not flattering at all. It was baggy and bulky and does not cover the chest area as pictured.  Returning."
2.0,"Loved the look of it, but it's very ""cheap"". The lace is very stiff and the ring will turn your finger green.  I got it for a costume and took it off in about an hour.  Not very comfortable.<br /><br />For what it is,  it's ""ok"" - as long as your expectations are low. If you're looking for something classy and elegant - this isn't it."
2.0,"Liked the overall design, but zippers were not military grade and a lot smaller than in picture. Kinda disappointed"
2.0,"Keeps demagnetizing my house card, If you live in a appartment or house with a key card I wouldn’t recommend this product."
2.0,A large fits like a small/medium. Order up in size. Super comfortable and really soft material other wise!
2.0,Washed them once and the whole waistband got all twisted and couldn’t wear them again
2.0,To small and stones fell out within two weeks.
2.0,I was expecting this to be more of a cardigan.  It's actually a t-shirt material.  It's also a bit too flowy for me.  I ended up returning it.
2.0,Disappointed. Liked the designs Runs small.. like a JRs. Returned
2.0,"This is a cheap, made in China hat.  The decals were printed off a cricut and applied.<br />The color was faded and the material was stiff.  I would wear it but I don't want to be laughed out of the room"
2.0,"I like dragons, and I’m a heavy guy. The shirt was like a second skin."
2.0,"Really a shame that the cut under the arms is just too tight. That's why I listed it as too small. The blouse itself is really not bad but I can't lift my arms in this. It fits great everywhere else but the underarm issue is a huge problem. It would go back if I didn't have to send it to China! I was very disappointed in this top. If you like this style, find it from another maker. Or if you stand like the model in the photo and never lift your arms up, you'll love it. I can't recommend this top.  I received it at a discounted price for an honest review."
2.0,"Too small, doesn't lock, can easily be broken. The fur was big and fraying."
2.0,To narrow  which wasn't  mentioned
2.0,These are a good design but very stiff and hard to get crease out. Disappointed
2.0,"Feels very hard on arch....get the feeling I am slipping to the side. Lesson learned....do not purchase shoes, try very briefly and put in the closet till spring, I regret that, lost the window for return unfortunately. REALLY REALLY test out your shoes first"
2.0,The bag is nice but the straps don't last. So I wouldn't recommend it.
2.0,Very disappointed in quality!
2.0,For the price they are ok. Very low quality and the white has light red spots where it looks like the color might ha e bled.
2.0,"Very disappointed in these sunglasses. For the price, I expected A LOT more. $10 shades are built better than these. Very flimsily feeling. It's marketed as a Cycling and Running shade, but I bet the wind rips these right off your face as soon as you get going, so buy yourself a neck strap too, while you're at it. They also ride very high on the nose and forehead compared to my other shades. In fact, after a few minutes of wearing these, I felt them to be uncomfortable entirely. Tipsey Elves makes a much better product similar designed for the same price. I own both. Go with the Tipsey Elves. The ONLY thing this pair of sunglasses has going for it is the AESTHETICS of retrowave street wear. I probably will only wear them once in a blue moon, which is a shame, as I was looking for a new every day pair of sunglasses to wear. I guess the hunt continues!"
2.0,"Smaller than advertised. Its not an infinity scarf as what it looks like in the picture. Its like a long tunnel that you put your head through and then it bunches up around your neck. Awkward design. Very soft, great color."
2.0,"They are so cute! I got so many compliments! However, some are so hard to get to unclick, you don't know if you can get them off. They also turned green after a month which means I am also allergic to them (that would explain the pain, I assume it was just my nose getting used to new rings) and will now be making as a gift for some one else. Very disappointed."
2.0,I did not like the bulky part at the bottom of the shirt-not flattering
2.0,Doesn't look remotely the smae
2.0,I bought a size up but is still too tight in hips. Will need to return this
2.0,"The dress was cute, but a little cheap-looking. The chiffon material was nice, though slightly see-through, but the lace was cheap material. I am 5'1&#34;, 135 lbs, with a 34D bust, I typically wear a small or medium. I was expecting this dress to be flowy, perfect for the beach, the small was just too baggy and super long."
2.0,"It runs small. Wasn't as pictured. Very thin. I didn't hate it, probably would have kept it had it fit (especially after I found out of the cost to send it back!!). Heads up IF YOU ORDER- it's coming from China, so it'll take a month to get it (the expected delivery date was changed before I got mine that added another almost 2 weeks) & if you are on the east coast like me it's going to cost you $12 to send it back."
2.0,This dress was purchased for in house wear. I read many reviews that recommended this dress and i honestly don't know what the hype is about.  The stitching is not even straight.  I am 5'6 and lbs208 pear shaped.  This dress gives me extra curves in an unflattering way! Its a waste of garment and money.
2.0,Does not have a high enough waistline to be considered maternity. It's great otherwise.
2.0,"I purchased this item for a two year old girl.  When received, the size on the tag of the hat read &#34; Infant - 2T&#34; not 2T-4T as described in the posting.  I purchased this large size knowing my daughter has a large head.  But this hat was very tight on her head and needed to be returned.<br />It was a very cute hat, had fleece lining and the embroidery / decoration on the outside looked great.  I just wish the sizing had been correct.<br />The company did reply that I did not receive the wrong size hat,  I received the size I had ordered."
2.0,I liked the way it looked and fit but the glitter sequins kept falling off and I would still be finding them on the floor a week later. The sequins would also be sticking to my skin after wearing the pants.
2.0,The fabric good quality but the sewing and manufacturing very poor
2.0,Quality and design were not a match as per listing. Would not recommend this product.
2.0,"The color is navy (not royal blue as depicted).  So I bought this wallet a year ago, and it worked very well until the large zipper broke about a month ago, so overall it only lasted 11 months before breaking beyond repair.  I expect more.  See pics of color and broken zipper.  Maybe I'm wrong.-"
2.0,"So I really wanted to like this sweater. But I couldn't. I'm 5'2 140lbs 36DD. The arms were too short and overall the sweater was just not as baggy and cute as it look on the model. Made me look really frumpy.<br /><br />I caution you, not as baggy as advertised."
2.0,"charm broke and fell off the third day I had it on my chain.  None of my other charms move.<br />Will not Prunkes again.  Very disappionted, cross was much smaller than appeared on like screen.  It was beautifully deatailed and I loved it, but I wish the manufactures would make the attachment stronger."
2.0,"Incorrect color sent. It fits as expected, however."
2.0,It was thin but cute but thinner than leggins
2.0,"I prefer a watch strap that fits.  This strap is much to short for the average wrist.  If I was a child or very skinny, it would be fine.  I don't feel like returning it, so I wear it at the very end of the strap.  Had to make a new hole so I could strap it on without stopping my circulation,"
2.0,"Cheap, tarnished in three days. Not good quality."
2.0,"Inflexible....hard to read, hard to wrap and smelly.  Not really worth the money...sorry to say.  I had to send it back."
2.0,This dress fit GREAT. The problem is the lace and the trim a entirely different colors. It looks AWFUL. I can't understand why this dress was made with RED (MAROON) TRIM it looks AWFUL.
2.0,"Cool, but the words rub off after less than a month. Which sucks."
2.0,Not a fan.  The bracelet is narrow and hard to put on and off.  And the silver is just okay at best.
2.0,It is cute but that top is just too tiny for my little one. I felt it showed too much of her mid section. I thought it was longer based on the picture.
2.0,It’s very cute literally! I never expected this to be this small. It doesn’t even fit my earlobe.
2.0,"The earrings were of decent quality, but the were smaller than expected, especially for the price. The earrings were returned for a refund."
2.0,"These masks are stylish and comfortable.  But the elastic pops off at the drop of a hat, rendering them unwearable."
2.0,The only double panel portion is the wait part so this has good tummy control. My thighs are on the thicker side so that part of the pants are a bit sheer. I've had to wear longer tops so I don't give a free show sometimes lol
2.0,They look very cheapy and like they’re made out of thread. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Did not have ear loops. Easily sucks into my nose and mouth.
2.0,Has quality issues. One side is lopsided.
2.0,Kinda small and poor quality...
2.0,This was bought as a Christmas gift and material looked good. The size was way bigger and returned for replacement but no replacement was an option. Also found better price point for similar items. We did not get to try the heating option as we did not wanted to open battery case as it was sealed and since the size was not right we just figure we would try after new replacement arrive<br />We might give it another shot based on reviews but again very few reviews makes you wonder
2.0,It was alittle big on me and the pants where not what I was expecting but other than that it was very cute and very comfortable!
2.0,poor quality! the sun broke off after one week wearing!
2.0,The sweater is a good quality but sizing is not accurate. I purchased a 3X thinking it would fit me (I wear a size 24W) but it was so small. It just made me look fatter. I don’t like buying clothes from Amazon anymore because things don’t fit.
2.0,The material got torn right away
2.0,"I ordered 2 sizes up to make sure it would be cozy, but it was still too small! Had to donate."
2.0,I've used the belt for a few days.  Not worth the sale price.  Already wearing and it the sizing chart is off.  Go bigger.
2.0,I was very disappointed. It does not look like the image. The charms are the same color bright silver as the bracelet. It looks like some out of a gum ball machine.
2.0,Did not care for the print once I saw it in person. It was kind of 'muddy' looking.
2.0,"2 stars because the shirts delivered quickly and they seem well made. But, I received 2 shirts and the description clearly says it is a 3 pack. Disappointing."
2.0,It is very big and the zipper gets stuck cheap quality
2.0,"There is no way these could fit around my normal bicep, they were very tight even right above my elbow and set to the maximum size."
2.0,Liked the feel but sizes are way off. These smalls are the size of a large!!
2.0,"They haven't held up at all. Already they have holes, pretty upset since they are only about three months old."
2.0,Cute dog. The chain broke as soon as my nephew opened the package and lifted it up which was a bummer but the chain looks like one of those you get from a .25 cent machine in front of the Dollar General so I was planning to buy a decent one after seeing this anyway.
2.0,Funny but the armpit ripped after one wear.
2.0,"I like the canvas-type fabric, but it isn't for people who have a bust."
2.0,The product that I received is the right material.  But it does not look like the picture shown.  Its okay.  Not worth returning but I will be very careful in the future ordering from this maker.  Fits as expected.
2.0,"This is a true happy orange!  Bought a small & fits fine.  BUT, please be aware of mismatched stripes!  I took a chance & thought it wouldn't stand out too much, but it is VERY noticeable - the hem line looks crooked & side seams hap hazard - sorta like a homemade mistake!"
2.0,not like it
2.0,"These glasses are cute! My first pair came shipped in an envelope with the box inside crushed - the glasses were super crooked and would not sit straight on my face. They were cute though and I wanted them to fit so I had them replaced. I was immediately shipped another pair, yet again in an envelope with the thin cardboard box inside crushed. Luckily this pair fit despite the crushed box.  I like them. The lenses are dark and polarized so they do the job.  They do have a strange imperfection in the epoxy surrounding the lens which is noticeable but for the price I guess you cannot expect a whole lot."
2.0,This shirt was so small. I gave it to my son to wear.
2.0,"Very nice shirt, unfortunately it runs small.  I ordered XXL and it looked like a large, didn’t fit"
2.0,"After receiving the shirt, my son didn't really like the design."
2.0,Very unsatisfied with this dress doesn’t fit at all I will need to lose weight to fit it I guess it will encourage me to do so
2.0,"Good quality fabric, but it is not flattering for someone with my body style. It is very loose at the shoulders and arms, tight on the chest (loose on ribs and tight on stomach - so not made for curvy girls), too long and just an awkward cut altogether. It fits large and maybe would look good on someone much taller, with a small bust. I am 5'2, 130 lbs with a 32DD and ordered a small do not recommend this dress for anyone with similar measurements."
2.0,"Doesn't fit as depicted, May require purchasing a larger size than would normally fit."
2.0,"these are a size small medium, not a flex all"
2.0,Way too tight. Returned
2.0,"It's a good had, but it's too small.  No way on product info page to know what size it is.  Glad it was on sale.  Diameter is about 7 inches inside."
2.0,"It's nothing like the one in the picture. It's almost like a long skirt with no gather. If you are a US size 12, you will have trouble walking in this skirt like lehenga. If you're 14 and up, you wont be able stitch it as the circumference is not big enough. Length is fine. I'm 5'6&quot; and it was touching the floor when i hold it by my waist.<br />Material is very light and the dupatta is like the shiny net we use to decorate Krishna idols. Very thin and not very long either. The lehenga material is synthetic thin and not good quality.<br />It's the type i'd imagine maid's 9 year old daughter would wear back home for dandiya night. Not something i'd pay any Rs.500 not $25.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's going back."
2.0,They are to short they need to be longer.
2.0,Ordered two packs of multi color.  Received all black and gray.  Waistbands are also less comfortable than the ones I purchased a few years ago.
2.0,"Non-binding is apparently a matter of opinion. These are way too tight in the toe area, and are binding on top. Am returning them."
2.0,Not very comfortable at all. Feels like walking on cardboard.
2.0,Tore after about 5 uses
2.0,This is too long for people with small wrist
2.0,The hat came all folded up and it ruined the brim of the hat. There are 4 large creases and it seems like there are cracks inside. I don't think it can be fixed and the creases look strange when I wear the hat.
2.0,They are pretty and I like the ear ties but the plastic fogs up when you breathe and speak so it really doesn't help talking with HOH people.  The plastic makes it hotter than other masks and that makes it hard for me to breathe.  It suffocating.
2.0,"It is super cute print, but it's too small. Thought it was going to fit perfectly based on the size chart. I am sad since it is nice material"
2.0,Tight around the ankles and very little elasticity. Hurts when doing various poses when the ankles are flexed. Grip/nonslip was okay.
2.0,This bracelet is very flimsy. I'm afraid I'm gonna break it everytime I put it on. Way too light weight and delicate for its size. I guess I should have paid more attention to the fact that it's only 6.8 g.
2.0,"I ordered the short sleeve version of this dress and it was great and the material was wonerful. For some reason, the material on this one was a lot more stuff so the dress didn't flow very well. Love the design, just not the fit or material."
2.0,The material is not great. Running in it is not the best feeling. Cant compare to 90 degree or Adidas/Under Armour leggings.
2.0,The image looks like it was enlarged from a low resolution image causing it to be very pixilated.
2.0,Broke before I could even wear it!
2.0,The khaki color is much darker than the pictures advertise and the fabric is like the thicker material you would find at like Walmart. Unfortunately gonna return these :/
2.0,After one wash the material piled.
2.0,Lenses are not large enough to cover my regular glasses
2.0,"I thought I would love these. They fit well. However, the foot bed was way too structured and hard for me. It just didn’t hit my foot in the correct places, causing more foot pain. The arch was too far toward the toe for my foot. I have a pretty normal width foot and a pretty normal arch. I usually don’t have an issue with shoes. The arch was also too wide. It was the right height on my inner foot, though slightly too far forward, but the raised part extended laterally too far. Super uncomfortable shoe."
2.0,Super small and not flowy at all. Disappointed
2.0,"I loved these glasses when they arrived. They look great and were very comfortable. I actually bought 2 pairs, blue and red, for my 9 year old. Unfortunately, he only wore the red twice before they broke and the blue for about 5 min before they broke. Both snapped in the same exact place - - right where the glasses bend - - and in both cases, my child was not being rough with the glasses. They really do not hold up to very basic wear--or really, very basic holding."
2.0,Gave my daughter cuts on the sides of her feet right below her ankles.  Where the straps are rubbed her feet and gave her circle like cuts from constant rubbing.  Worthless shoes now! Waste of money!  Need a better design to prevent this. Stride rites are supposed to be a better shoe this shouldn't happen.  Bought a pair of  $9 water shoes from babies r us that are designed better.  Disappointed and frustrated!
2.0,I got an used watch and this product is listed as new.
2.0,"Tag was cut out of the outfit making it so you can't verify fabric. It does not feel like cotton.<br />And the company name on the brand tag doesn't match the name of the company that sells it.<br />Other than that it is nicely made and very cute. If you're looking for true fabrics (cotton, linen, etc.) I wouldn't buy it but otherwise it's good."
2.0,"So the product was as described.  But, it came in a soft envelope and was broken when we opened it. It was meant for my nephews PROM and I had to glue it back together in order for him to wear it. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Bought these for my cruse in the Caribbean, after wearing each one once they all broke in the same spot on the frames under the senses, good buy if you want to wear them once."
2.0,sucks but looks cool
2.0,"These are more orange than pink….<br /><br />I was also expecting a more rustic look, but it’s just plain tshirt.<br /><br />The fit is also not the same as the model.<br /><br />The material is thicker and not breathable."
2.0,Only came with four of the five rings. They are very cheaply made and the black ones are coated in a black paint that breaks off. The lizard one is curved into a u-shape in person and is unwearable.
2.0,Material not as expected and cut of fabric is off on the top but generous on the bottom. Plus the under slip is super short and dinky.
2.0,The pants for perfect. The khaki color is not a khaki but a dark tan.
2.0,"I’ve had several of Sak purses and am always pleased. Was excited about this style with credit card slots .  It was very difficult to place cards in slots ( never did get them all in) and even more difficult to remove them .  I liked style, size and pattern but hugely disappointed.  Will return purse"
2.0,These things barely flop at all....they are nothing like what is shown on TV.  Overmarketed item and not worth the money.
2.0,The belt looks good and arrived timely. The inside leather is very raw and unfinished and rubs off on dark slacks. How was this not noticed during the production process? This is why a sheened finish is added to belts. The raw leather also makes the belt more difficult to put on because of the friction.
2.0,"es ligero y la imitación de brillo es muy mala, no lo recomiendo."
2.0,These ponchos ripped as soon as we all put them on but they still kept us mostly dry
2.0,"I used to love these bracelets, but they eventually began to break, snap, and fall apart, which was a shame, because I really liked them."
2.0,"Large just about fit, my normal size would be medium. I reordered and got an x-large which was smaller than the large. Pretty top. Had strings hanging all over that had to be trimmed. The material was nice. If I could get one that fit properly I would reorder."
2.0,The quality is nice although the post was really long for my nose. It hit the other side and was pretty uncomfortable. I had to take it out.
2.0,The jewelry its self was. Fine just way too small for what I needed them for.
2.0,Its looks like a house dress.
2.0,It ripped the first time I wore it. I was bummed.
2.0,Shipping was on time. The product was being bought to add to my arsenal of gloves that I use for skiing for those really cold days on the slopes. The heating zone on the mittens are mostly in the palm away from the thumb area on the outside edge of the hand. The literature say high setting is 150 degrees. With fully charged batteries the heating doesn't come close to that in a 70 degree room. As measured the temp is 110 at best.  The insulation is not the best in these. Also runs small in size. Ordered large and fit like medium to small.
2.0,Received the Wedding Jewelry Ring set...beautiful but within a week lost 2 of the stones...wasn't really happy about that...
2.0,I expected a better looking pair of pants for the price
2.0,"These are really pretty, but if you plan to wear them a lot I would suggest it. They warped really badly and discolored within a week or two. If you don't plan to wear them a lot then they're great."
2.0,"It's a shame because the design was nifty, the material is sleek (though it takes a while to dry). I'm 5'8 , size 10 and curvy so the &#34;one-size-fits-most&#34; sadly did not apply to me on this one. My 5'2 friend had no trouble and even had extra fabric flow. The print design came exactly as advertised and was easy to use; it just didn't fit."
2.0,"It runs small.  I am a size medium, I ordered a size large and it still fit a bit tight. The hardware on the navy blue dress is gold not silver. The fabric is not of good quality which doesn't make the dress fall as elegant as it shows in the picture(s)."
2.0,Very cheaply made. The heart isn't as big as it shows in the picture nor is the chain. Totally disappointed.
2.0,"THE SIZE SMALLER THAN EXPECTED ,YET ,ITS BEEN MENTIONED THATR IT IS OF MEDIUM SIZE !!!!!!<br />IT TAKE SO LONG TO ARRIVE AND NO BAG CASE WITH IT !!!"
2.0,They look sort of cream colored in the photo but are a gold metallic.  Bright gold.  And there are slight defects in the finish which show up and make the glasses look a little tacky.
2.0,Fabric too thin and didn't hold shape.
2.0,it is a &#34;short jacket cut&#34;  not a shawl like cut
2.0,"In ordered a larger size thinking it would be easier to put on and they were lots larger going up over my kne<br />3"" and they were still hard to put on and take off...<br />Also the person who delivered them put tyhe package under a tree about .5 tenths of a mile from any house..<br />he did take a pic of the tree that is the only way we would of found it."
2.0,"They were fine for what I paid, but I ordered a 7 and was sent a 37 which is a size 5....so I have to return and try ordering a larger size. Disappointment because of how long I waited to receive, but thankful it's an easy return."
2.0,"I ordered the plum colored shirt and when I received it, it was burgundy. Nowhere close to a purple color. I was ordering it for a wedding and didn't have enough time to send it back or order another one. The shirt itself seems to be decent quality but seems to run a little large."
2.0,Lo lo pude utilizar muy chico
2.0,"Definitely not work $27. It’s a thin hoodie, cheap, and ran small."
2.0,a size 14 was very large.  needed to size down.
2.0,"Very cute dress! Was very happy with the design and was comfortable but I was only able to wear it once before it started to fall apart. The sleeves ripped off, the ruffles snagged and the thread started to pull and the bottom of the dress ripped up easily. Wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,"I fell in love with the color and the style. I tried it on and there is NO WAY the size is what they say. I'm a seamstress and this just didn't have the right measurements. The sizing is at least a size to two sizes off. I liked the fabric, the color choices and the design...but the SIZING sucked."
2.0,Not pleased with the quality of these shoes. After ONLY a handful of times my son wore his shoes one shoe has completely stopping working and the other shoe has 1 random light that is different that all the others.  A Christmas present FAIL!  Of course it stopped working just 2 weeks after the date in which I could have returned them and now I have a VERY sad 6 year old. Disappointed.
2.0,"Pretty color and it’s soft; only downside? It keeps falling apart. I wore it once for three hours and I had to take off a dozen or more tiny threads from the scarf unraveling. It’s very cute, but it’s definitely not going to last a wash. I’d be surprised if it lasted a month of use."
2.0,This product would not stick. I would not recommend buying. I'm a big chested girl and was hoping to find a product that would be great for support and would last through the night. Put the product on and right away it started seperating from skin.
2.0,"I ordered a medium as recommended and the fit was just a little tighter than I hoped but not uncomfortable. They were too long for my 5'3 height but I didn't mind. The reasons for only 2 stars... the navy is NOT squat proof. They are totally transparent and I definitely can't wear this to the gym. I wouldn't even wear them around the house! Sadly, my search for navy workout leggings continues. These will be going back.0"
2.0,I would like to keep this items
2.0,It’s HUGE. I had to make it look like I was trying to do an 80s type look for the day at work bc I don’t like to bother with returning things unless there is something wrong with it and it’s a comfortable sweatshirt so I mean whatever I’ll keep it. I was just very large and thin material.
2.0,Cool gloves but not as pictured.
2.0,"The color is so pretty but unforgettable the top of the dress looks like it was sewn by a child learning to sew... by hand. Aside from the quality issue, the fit wasn't flattering. The fabric hung awkwardly on me and didn't fit snugly around my waist or hips, so it looked like of frumpy.  Had to return."
2.0,"The color was NOT the shade described, nor anything like in the picture.  What I received was more of a milky see thru white. Not what I was expecting. It did come with a nice bag to put in, but will be returning it since it doesn't coordinate with my dress."
2.0,I didn't like the way it sat on my shoulder.  Not as flowing as pictured.
2.0,"The clip is very bulky; it obstructs your field of view. The lens also sits pretty far from the front of your glasses so it doesn't block much. Buy a much bigger size than your glasses and it might be fine, assuming you won't mind the black bars in the middle."
2.0,It didn't stay secure and kept falling out
2.0,Don't buy these if you want to stay warm. They're comfortable but very thin. My husband laughed at how much skin shows through for something considered made for winter.
2.0,Small kids size
2.0,So sad it fit horribly. Loved the material.
2.0,"Very disappointed in this item. In the picture, it was shown as being much larger than what it actually is. Not much room to put anything in it. I do like the keyboard and music notes on the outside, but not really helpful otherwise."
2.0,Bust is super tight. This looked too much like a costume to keep. Returned.
2.0,I love the charm. It was packaged beautifully. But the other item promised in the bundle was not included! I'm very disappointed because I really need the clasp opener. at this point I don't recommend this vendor since the website description is not accurate.
2.0,Looks nice but slides up and down on my waist --- which is annoying! These belts to stay in put depend on the fabric of your clothes. Not for silk or cotton.
2.0,"Not what I ordered. My order was for Window Replacements by Rolfs D) Credit Card Windows (4 7/8 x 3 3/4 inches), holds 24 photos or credit cards, SIDE loading.  The order I receivd is for 16 windows, TOP loading and is by Buxton. I advised Menswallet of the error and was told they were sending the right order out.  I received the second order which was the same wrong order as the first.  I've asked that if the order can't be filled as requested to credit my account.  I'm waiting for the return label and refund.<br />So disappointed I didn't get what I had ordered.  If I didn't need 24 windows then the 16 would have been fine, it seems to be good quality."
2.0,"I will not be ordering these gloves again. As a very busy Santa, I need gloves that are durable and will hold up well. These gloves do not. Almost every pair arrived defective with either runs in the material, seams coming apart as well as the stitching of the edging at the heel at the wrist failing so it is not stitched. Also the material is very thin even see-through. They are also about 1/2-1” shorter than other gloves of much higher quality. Again, I will not buy these gloves again."
2.0,Not fully closed
2.0,Gold quality is gorgeous and the necklace is so pretty. I wanted to love it so much but they sent me the wrong name. Now I have no use for it.
2.0,Cant even see the diamonds for what it cost I feel ripped off...I can't even send em back  because of the timing for gift.
2.0,"The Large was not large in my opinion and could maybe be a large for a toddler but not a Kid.  Quality, Price and appearance is all to my satisfaction."
2.0,Bought these for my daughter.  They are very thin and big for the size she normally wears.
2.0,Came across this bathing suit and it immediately caught my attention. I was going on vacation and just New it would look good against my skin tone. I wanted it in that dark Almost hunter green. The bathing suit came in and it was practically blue. It fit great on me. I am 5’4” with about 160lbs. C cup on the top and a little junk in the trunk. I just was really sad I did not wear it.
2.0,shipping package was smashed watch is fine. There where no English instructions and couldn't fined any online had to mess it for 25min to get it set to correct time and it took almost a month to get here. Overall happy with the watch. So only 2 stars on this one.
2.0,"Alloy had me itching almost immediately, epoxy application was terrible missed areas and came out very easily."
2.0,"This dress looked fabulous in the pictures. It also fit pretty well however, the material it’s made of is comparative to a vinyl table cloth. The sound it makes while wearing it also sounds like you are unfolding a table cloth. It looked like cotton from the pictures however it is a very cheap material and want worth the money I paid for it. It was a complete waste of my time and money."
2.0,"Like the Spider-Man Homecoming style one, for whatever reason, this was too big compared to the many others I've bought from Red Plume."
2.0,Super cute but the ankle part is too big and won’t stay on feet.  Socks give about as much protection from the ground. Wouldn’t wear outside.
2.0,Cute belt and fits well but I ordered white and received black. Now the white isn’t even available in my size.
2.0,"Way smaller than expected- the sizing is wagt off. My daughter is a tall 1-year old. So I bought 18 months. I’m not sure if it shrunk in the washer or something, but we had to use it as a t-shirt since there was no way in hell we could close those buttons.<br /><br />It also didn’t wash well. After the first washing (which happened before my daughter got to wear it so we’d get rid of all chemicals), the writing already crumbled."
2.0,"It tarnished very fast, after three days."
2.0,It is a beautiful watch band but it is far too bulky to wear. Its also very hard to adjust to make it tighter. Its a good watch band if your not planning on adjusting it but if you are it is too thick to move much.
2.0,I am 5’4 and this dress was a full length dress all the way to my ankles. It also fit a bit loose around the upper chest area. I ordered a size small I’m 125lbs. Overall didn’t like the fit and had to exchange it.
2.0,"the seems started coming apart after the first time I wore them, poor choice."
2.0,Super short. If you’re looking for underboob then this shirt should get 5stars…if not then you should probably order up a size or two if if busty for nice fit.
2.0,The fabric on this is thin and CHEAP. I could not bring myself to wear it to work. It looks like someone took a cheap halloween tablecloth and made it into a dress.
2.0,I had to return it because the Large was tight and wayyyyy too short. It looked like a crop top on me. I wanted it for work. Definitely not. This sweater runs super small. What a pity.
2.0,"This is the the best fabric,"
2.0,This is sized for a small woman. I think I'm an average sized adult and this was much too tight around my neck to be worn comfortably.
2.0,I wanted to give this 4 stars because the first two days I wore it I loved it but on the 3 wear one of the boning popped out and dug into my side it was very painful.
2.0,"Used as a gift for my child, sister and myself. Was very disappointed on all aspects -especially band quality."
2.0,It looks adorable but once it arrived the fabric was obviously poor quality. I returned it.
2.0,Shrinks easily. They fit perfectly at first. But one wash and dry and they're unable to be worn again
2.0,Fits tight under the arms.  I never zip it up for that reason.
2.0,The mask was very big. I didn’t use it much.
2.0,"Too small for mans head, well at least for mine!"
2.0,"Cute, but much shorter than I expected. The photo is definitely misleading."
2.0,This wasn't really what I wanted. I was hoping that the band width would be a little thicker. Ended up returning this item..
2.0,These tanks do not work as compression tanks at the sizes given (even taking into account the seller's comments on size) if you think &#34;compression&#34; means that they will actually compress anything - they are too loose and the material is too weak.<br /><br />I regret the purchase and certainly would not buy again.
2.0,The fit is good but the fabric is very cheap and poorly sewn.
2.0,They didn’t fit at all. I am 5’ 160lbs .<br />They were way too big.
2.0,Looks cheap and very thin material.
2.0,These shoes are not as comfortable as the description reads!
2.0,I ordered a pair 1 size larger than I typically wear and had to wrestle them to get on. You need to order 3 sizes larger than necessary if you want to breathe!
2.0,I was so disappointed with the sizing on this gown. I usually buy a larger size for comfort so I was so surprised when this gown felt 3 sizes too small. I couldn’t even get it over my chest.
2.0,"I bought this for  costume and thought it would be stretchy - it's not.  Mind you, I wear a size 4-6 and it is much too small for me even when I unlace it as much as possible - the laces are very short."
2.0,not a very good quality of the material
2.0,the dress is cute but it did not support or cover my breast. Not for larger breasted females if you don't want to be exposed
2.0,order a size smaller!!!!! mine was huge!!!!!!!!!!
2.0,"Product was okay, would of expected it to last longer. Fit around the wrist like someone else stated is a little loose. But I didn’t mind.  Glove comfort and grip were spot on. However I purchased the glove for our mid season golf tournament about a month ago. And it’s already destroyed with a giant hole in the palm. I’ve been trying to find a glove that will last me at least a season.  I play about 1-2 times a week and this glove didn’t last. Unfortunately I won’t be buying another one. Back to the drawing board to try to find a glove that will give me a whole season out of it."
2.0,"Dress looks great in ad but doesn't present itself the same.  It is much shorter.  I am 5'7.5 and it came to my calfs. Not the look I was going for.  Disappointing.  Took quite a while to come.  Would send it back,  but feel pressured to keep with all of the info out about Amazon blocking customer's accts because they return items too much."
2.0,"In the backward world of Chinese sizing, this fit more like UK Sizing (not quite as big as US but much closer). It is a bit bigger than I'd love, but I did have to laugh when that was the issue for once."
2.0,"The product looks nice ,  but the quality is not good, fabric is very thin and the pants (size s) were very long for me."
2.0,I just wanted reading glasses. Should have been able to purchase alraedy on.
2.0,Doesn't  close tight . Very heavy.
2.0,"These belts are functional; take them hiking or working in the yard or something. The belt itself is cheap and the buckles are worse; originally thought the buckles might be interchangeable with other belts, but I would not use this cheaply made buckle with any other belt, nor would I wear these belts in public."
2.0,"Very disappointed in this tanking top.  The material was very poor, cheap looking.  No quality whatsoever.  It also does not run true to size.  Returned it immediately!"
2.0,"It fit like a paper lunch sack.  Shoulders were a bit tight, the tummy area was boxy and large."
2.0,Holes started appearing after wearing it only twice.
2.0,Sleeves were too short. Fabric was nice. Length was nice.
2.0,Material is thicker than expected and snaps on the bottom bothered my 4 year old.  We returned it and chose other one piece leotards with built in skirts.
2.0,the quality of the sweater is not real good the zippers when closed makes the sweaters sides curve up.  do not dry and wash in light easy front loader not a top loader because the sweater quality would not hold up.  It also is itchy.  the color is good though
2.0,"Can't wear this, the material is itchy, almost causing a rash/allergic reaction, and I don't have allergies. Too bad, looks nice."
2.0,The hat is made for a big headed man and the pants were big!! I was so embarrassed when I received this. The onesie was a normal onesie.. it was cute. Could’ve got it anywhere.
2.0,Zipper came unstitched from the fabric the first time I wore the pink one.  I gave it 2 stars because the black one hasn't broken yet.  Straps are long and hardly shorten enough.
2.0,"Too small, and the fabric was very stiff."
2.0,suppose to be 2x fit like medium
2.0,"The top fit me great, but the bottoms seemed giant, and were much more high-waisted than the product picture would suggest.  I figured it would end at or slightly above my belly button, but it basically went halfway up my ribcage.  I have a shorter torso, so this wasn't a good look for me.  But for someone slimmer with a longer torso, I could see it being cute."
2.0,"The buckle D ring is stamped out, not formed solid.  Looks nice from the front, but the buckle is hollow on the underside with with side edges pressed down into your skin when you cinch it up.  Not comfortable. Too bad, the webbed belt portion is nice quality,"
2.0,"Scratchy. Bottom line for me. Would have needed to order a band size down, but I’m not keeping it."
2.0,This is silky shirt. Flimsy and thin.
2.0,These things really didn't stick on my shoe and then they started to peel off at the corners. I would not buy again.
2.0,"This dress has no give. I ordered a size large and couldn't even get this dress to pass over my shoulders. Putting my arms into the sleeves first didn't work either. S-M-L area all chiffon material and plus sizes are polyester, which runs extremely large....... Gave 2 star because of the style.......  If you purchase a regular size, make sure you're skinny. If you purchase a plus size, make sure you're fat....."
2.0,I am a small and i ordered the large. Is a bit too long but it fits.<br />Is really light weight just like a fall jacket. I do not think i will be able to use it in winter though.
2.0,The material is very cheap and there is a seam right down the center. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known this
2.0,This is a very pretty top that fits like a M/L not an XL and feels like a kimono. I was hoping for a comfortable top and unfortunately did not realize I ordered from a third party and will not be ordering from this company again.
2.0,2XL fits like a Large
2.0,they are comfortable but they bled a dark blue black ink all over my pillows and sheets. It was a mess and took multiple washes to get cleaned
2.0,"The jacket was fine overall, but the zipper is reversed. Is that a woman's zipper? If it was easier to return it, I would. I cannot imagine how a manufacturer could let this kind of thing happen. I wonder what other flaw will occur to me as I wear it. For now, I plan on wearing it without using the zipper. I may never buy another clothing item on the internet that has a zipper. I am really irked."
2.0,The blouse is adorable super disappointing when i tried it on.. way to small.  I suggest you go up two sizes.
2.0,These t-shirts shrunk after washing them. I would not buy them again.
2.0,Quality isn’t that great was way to big for my 2yearold and she’s a reg 4t but it fit like a5t
2.0,"The sweatshirt is long in the sleeves but extremely short in the midriff.<br />Seems to be fair quality material and if your goal is to show off your bellybutton, then this sweatshirt is for you. I would recommend ordering 1-2 sizes larger."
2.0,Returned. Weird length
2.0,It is not wide enough at the toes. It does not give support when walking.  I purchased for my 91 year old mother.  I was hoping this shoe had enough structural support to prevent her from tripping.  I ended up giving her my addias I bought at Costco's and the Adidas gives her support for a slip on.
2.0,"The jeans came a lot bigger around the waist than I thought. I’m typically a 00 or 24 and the size small was extremely big for me. Although, super great material."
2.0,Does not look as good as the picture.. The top has a weird cut on it which makes it fit oddly. I couldn't send it back because I missed the timeline taking care of my boyfriend who passed from cancer.
2.0,"Super cute dress and style. Ripped down the seam. For the amount of money, it's not worth the material. Loved the pockets though!"
2.0,"Fabric was MUCH thinner and lighter weight than expected. The edges were raw cut and unhemmed. While this fabric can be left that way.....it looked, felt and appeared to be extremely cheap! I was embarrassed that I gave it as a gift."
2.0,Way too small! Order two sizes up
2.0,Keeps popping out
2.0,Decent matriwrl but I’m avgerage girl size and bought the appropriate size and this did not hold my iPhone 6. It slid down and bobbled along when I walked. Maybe if it were a few inches shorter/tighter fit it could have worked.
2.0,"Got xxl and its to small for me, 6 3&#34; 200lbs wife likes it on her tho"
2.0,Cheaply made and defective.  One of the straps was too far over and slid off shoulder.  Not the same distance as the other strap.  Very odd....
2.0,It shines too much for me! It looks cheap and too much stiffness.
2.0,This is not cute at all.and shirt is too small.
2.0,Shipping was awful for paying an extra $20 and it really could have used a better polish job. Looked awful around the hearts. Still cute tho.
2.0,I actually love the bracelet but it broke the second day I wore it.  I am very disappointed that I can no longer wear it.
2.0,I can't wear it because it fits so awkwardly. It's too small yet too big at the same time. Just does not cover the right places. Would not recommend.
2.0,"Zipper came broken,  had to return.  Runs small on top."
2.0,Just what I wanted. I love the purse but the lining has already torn.
2.0,"These gloves were a disaster. Not only did I drop the dishes and break them because they slipped right out of the gloves and there’s really no grip, they ripped/tore A few days after I purchased them so I would really not recommend these"
2.0,Definitely not even close to the colors shown and not even remotely oversized. The material is soft which is about the only thing going for it.
2.0,"The material was so thin, and the neckline is a lot wider than the picture. Kind of looked like a loose trash bag on my bod.  Not a fan."
2.0,Another item that is not machine washed or dried but it has little balls all over it after only a few wears and hand washed
2.0,Sits crooked on head...
2.0,A little smaller than anticipated and one side loosely closes.
2.0,"Cute for little ones but it is for very small heads. Because of how/where the velcro is placed, it is difficult to position for stability."
2.0,"I always wear Miss Elaine. Favorite brands these are a tremendous disappointment. I’m 5’1 and 100 pounds. Ordered a small. The pants are long, but comfortable waist, not tight. But the top is like a fitted t shirt, with very little room to move around, and little give. It actually looks like a regular tee, scalloped bottom,. I know as soon as it hits the wash, it will be uncomfortable on. Miss Elaine has always been quality, comfortable and perfect for me. These are cotton, but has no thickness, no cozy anything. The price was right, and now I know why they did not sell well. Skimpy top that will not let you move when sleeping. Going back. Not up to Miss Elaine’s standards. At all. Cotton isn’t even soft."
2.0,Ran small and the slit is very high. Had to return because the slit was very revealing.
2.0,The chain was so fine it appeared it would break with the first wear. I did not like the way it was made.
2.0,"This dress would be great if the &#34;gold necklace&#34; that holds it up didn't attack every strand of hair on my head/neck!<br /><br />I was excited to receive this dress, hoping I could wear it to an upcoming wedding, so as soon it arrived I rushed to my room to try it on... but OUCH! The slinky-esque necklace literally pulled at every hair and I couldn't go through with trying it on... it just hurt too much! I bought the dress in two colors, but I'll be returning both, as they are too painful to wear... Which is a shame, because they are beautiful dresses!"
2.0,"just ok, bought as a gift for an 8 year old, have my doubts that it will fit comfortably."
2.0,"Shoes came shipped in little plastic bag.  Fit very small.  If they had fit and I had kept them, glad I didn't pay more than I did.  Very cheap materials.  Don't look like they'd last more than one season."
2.0,I liked this ring alot but then after a couple of weeks wearing it one of the stones just fell out. :(
2.0,"Good absorbance of sweat, but they are too wide to be attractive or comfortable.  Don't know why someone can no longer make 1 inch sports headbands instead of these 2 inch things.  Don't really like them at all but can't find anything else.  I sweat profusely during workouts and have to have something on my head, but these would never be my choice if anything else were available."
2.0,"Watch band broke in a week and am very dissatisfied, I spent extra on the stainless one sp this wouldnt happen"
2.0,"Looks nice but after only two days, it has a crack. See pic attached here."
2.0,"I bought this a Christmas present for my boyfriend.. he loved it, BUTTT he put it on, and after FIVE MINUTES, the clasp broke and it fell from his neck.  I will NOT be buying from this company again.<br /><br />Even though it broke, it is exactly what they specify it to be. Very nice chain, horrible and cheap clasps. What a disgrace to the chain."
2.0,Way to big for children’s age
2.0,"I thought they would fit to hug each ear, but they're shaped the same for each. So one hugs  my ear, and the other runs away from my ears curve. That was unexpected."
2.0,An ok top. Just runs very small.
2.0,"The metal heart at the front is fixed in place so that the front of the choker is flat and does not curve to the neck, thus making it look very odd and feeling totally uncomfortable."
2.0,Quality is very cheap...
2.0,"They look cute from the front. But two issues: One, the style/length make them look like clown pants, someone at a circus on stilts would wear. Two, they run so high in the back they do not flatter your back end, unless it’s big and your waist is tiny. Sad because I really wanted to love them. If the style/color/length were slightly different they might work. They fit well other than length. I’m 5’5” 120 lbs, size M. I returned them. Zipper is also a small struggle."
2.0,Earrings Are Beautiful however they did not last a day.. They Broke Easily while in my Ear.
2.0,"Smaller than expected, got damaged in packaging ):"
2.0,"While this works it seems to be made more cheaply out of a stiffer material. It's more difficult to put on and the end that sticks out beyond the stud snap is stiff, doesn't lay flat against the band, sharp, and catches on clothing and other things. This seems to be a classic Chinese ""clone"" product that's not as good as even the Chinese original from Xiaomi."
2.0,not too sturdy
2.0,I like them but they're little big.<br />I was hoping they're a little tighter for a little more supporter On My Feet.<br />But they are comfortable..
2.0,"The ring itself was clunky... also,the stone was nothing close to the illustration on the site. I sent it back!"
2.0,"In the Picture it says Super but my T Shirt says Bitch. Not a big deal for me, it's just not what I expected and it's not what I initially ordered."
2.0,Claims it's 100% cotton. It is not. It's a polyester knit.
2.0,I am not sure if it is just me or it suppose to be that way! I don't really like this product because you can barely tell how it really is
2.0,"Poor quality better examples are available for a similar price from other sellers and outlets , the clasp is going to be a downgrade on basisly any watch its moved to add too this that the item is extremely light on a standerd 40 mm 165 gm about watch this item is extremely unbalanced feeling unless its a seiko 5 then this braclet will be a downgrade"
2.0,"The watch is beautiful and resistant to dust and impact, but has a problem with water resistance.. after almost a year of use, I was taking a shower before going to work and when I came out the inside of the watch was foggy, meaning the seals have broken and the watches are supposed to have 10 years warranty and its not like I am going scuba diving or similar..."
2.0,"Time-keeping was not reliable for the digital OR analog from the beginning, and now the band and pin broke.<br /><br />I bought this for my husband because he often -knocks on wood- for things and he ALWAYS wears a watch. This was a fun and functional way to enable that habit and be thoughtful.<br />Within the first month, we realized that it wasn't keeping time, we had to reset both the analog and digital time every couple weeks at least.<br />Now, sure, its been over a year, but the band and a pin broke as my husband was swatting a bee in his face.<br />Its not the worst watch, but I wouldn't buy it again.<br />I'm looking for a different wooden watch for him."
2.0,Earrings are super cute however one of them is defective so it won’t say screwed in so it keeps falling off.
2.0,Very thin plastic material. Looks cheaply made. Not expecting this to last very long. Wouldn’t order again
2.0,I thought they were good for the price but my son is 7 and they were way to small.
2.0,The item was to be a cotton blend Grey jogging suit. I received a 100% polyester item that was not to my liking and had to give it away. It is the second time that an item has taken this long and the wrong thing has been sent. I like Amazon but they need to be a better coordination of orders and packages.
2.0,Horrible no tag on dress and dress had a small hole in it I gave it away
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Poor quality.
2.0,Good fabric but circumference is too small. No room if you have a lot hair or you have Briads on.
2.0,I wear a medium but ordered a large and it was still way too small all over
2.0,big disappointment: the front does not fully unbutton! it's real buttons above the shirred waist; the waist and the next 6 buttons or so down to about crotch level are on a sewn-shut placket; real buttons from crotch to knee. that means you either have to step into it or put it over your head...neither of those is what i want! i was planning to use this as an around-the-house comfy thing and had envisioned putting it on the way you do a button-down shirt...button 3 or 4 buttons in the middle and go. but no!<br /><br />rayon is only nice-feeling fabric if it's been put in a tumble dryer - this shrank about 4&#34; in length after drying and also shrank in every other direction though not that much. the fit prior to washing and drying was about what i expected.<br /><br />the fabric is very thin so i was glad i bought the &#34;black2&#34; version - it's only see-through when backlit. pattern and colors look like the pic though in reality it is rather cheap looking. there is no drawstring waist...it's just a decorative yarn/rope thing. i took it off because long strings in the washer are trouble.<br /><br />i'm short-waisted and figured the shirred waist style wouldn't be terribly flattering...i was correct. :)<br /><br />not crazy about the fabric-covered buttons. they are sort of dome-shaped and are a little bit of a hassle getting buttoned and unbuttoned
2.0,It’s ok cheaply made. I won’t buy again
2.0,It didn’t fit properly and I’m larger than a double d and the d was too big. I couldn’t properly position it without a little hanging off. It lost its stickiness with my adjusting really quickly
2.0,"Excellent cap for only covering your head; however, if you are looking for a skullcap that will also cover your ears, at least partially, keep on looking."
2.0,I got exactly what I paid for
2.0,The stone in one of the earrings fell out immediately!
2.0,"The shorts fit great because I’ve purchased two other ones in size XS, but the matching sports bra is SO TINY! It looks like it’s meant for a child and I can barely get it over my head."
2.0,fabric is too thin
2.0,"Not all were the same size, one was significantly smaller. Additionally, one had a seem come undone the first time it was worn. Really disappointed since I've used Knockers for years."
2.0,The waist is too high dont like the fit
2.0,pretty dress but not very flattering. it was large up too and too small of the bottom.
2.0,Clutch looked very cheap. Returned.
2.0,It looks like something straight out of a bubble gum machine..
2.0,"I have bought a lot of earrings in this style because I really like the way they look. None of the earrings I've purchased before are stellar in quality but they were all exactly what I expected visually. These, however, were not anything like what I saw in the product picture and therefore were very disappointing upon arrival. The paint on the flowers is already rubbing away on several pedals, the green stars are not consistently distributed between the two bulbs (one is really empty looking, the other is a little too full) and the green sprig of color is not nearly as striking! That was the part of the design I was most drawn to so that was really disappointing.  I had plans to buy the other colors in this set but I won't be doing that now. One pair is enough."
2.0,The dress runs small but even sizing up doesn’t help. I received a dress that would look very nice on a 7’ person who was very thin. Very disappointed.
2.0,I love the bottoms and since it was so inexpensive I'm keeping the suit just for the bottoms but the top was too big and floppy.  I ordered a size larger as suggested but shouldn't have.  The black part would have been okay if there was an area where you could tuck it up either into the bust area or the waist area.  It was way too poofy and didn't look as fitted as the picture shows.
2.0,"Well, it was a gift for my brother, but I wouldn't wear them sorry! But what happened to made in the USA!!!!!!"
2.0,My son didn't even get to wear them before one of the shoes stopped working. My niece's pair still works 7 months later though. I know the reviews warned they are hit or miss.
2.0,Not very warm and the zipper was weak and broke after 3 uses. Didn’t work on my phone or iPad.
2.0,"I wanted to like these overalls so bad. They fit perfect everywhere. I’m a mom and it hides my mom belly so well. It also has pockets! If you’re a mom, you know how essential it is to have pockets. But the material is cheap. I don’t think these will hold up for more than 2-3 washes. There was a hole in my left pocket. The adjustable metal fasteners easily bend. I wouldn’t recommend these due to the poor quality."
2.0,"Wanted to loved this dress so bad! I’m 5’0, petite/athletic build. Ordered a small and it is definitely made for you if you have > C cups, short torso, small waist, and extremely long legs. Still dragged a lot when I wore 6” heels. That’s what I got out of trying this on. It’s so pretty and the quality is definitely there! Can’t hem it though."
2.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; and 125. The Fit was great, However, I bought 2 pair for work and they didn't even last 6 months before getting holes in the material.  Good while they lasted, but ultimately a waste of money."
2.0,This came in quickly and the silver and outline of spider looks great but the spider is gold and background is black NOT silver and navy as seen in the picture. This was meant to represent my son’s love for Spider-Man and the black is not what I expected.
2.0,I really love the outfit on pictures but doesn’t like the quality of the fabric. The hat it’s way too big to match the age of the clothes. The hat fits perfectly my boy 3yol head.<br /><br />I’m storing this outfit till i decode to cut a little bit some part of the shirt to make it fit or just leave it new in a box.
2.0,This shirt is cheaply assembled and awkwardly shaped. Glad I can return it free of charge.
2.0,"So small. Tiny is more appropriate. Feel like it's more of a child chain. Disappointed for a special, not wanting anything more from this maker."
2.0,"Should have checked return policy. The design of the product is flawed, but I didn't realize until after purchase. The clip being on the same side as the opening closure makes for cumbersome usage. Not sure why it was designed that way. Unfortunately, when I found a better product, realized that this was not returnable. Very disappointing."
2.0,"This is still cute but the bead is yellow, not gold. Be warned :)"
2.0,"I got this for my step daughter for her 3rd birthday party. The top fit well and she could wear it again if she wanted, but the bottoms started to fall apart after only wearing it for about 3 hours. It's just tulle with a very large ribbon - not as cute as in the picture. It worked for what we used it for, but I would never pay that much for this outfit again."

2.0,"WENT ON SITE to check for size for the small,medium,large.....site was for CLOTHING........made it difficult to order...guessed and ended up with two sizes to big ...called for return and was told by representative I should have checked the size chart...I told him I had . He then told me for the size I asked him for would be a medium.......MAKE SURE YOU CALL TO ORDER THESE SLIPPERS SO THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE CORRECT SIZE OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE LOOKING AT CLOTHING SIZES."
