1.0,"I give it to a Cuban friend as a give it did not last  2 days,  it turn dark so quick. This is garbage , unfortunately I pay for it !"
1.0,"I really wanted to liked this outfit, but the material was way too thin. Its a very thin linen and there is no give to it. It fit ok on top but extremely tight on my bottom. I don't recommend if you have a bigger behind."
1.0,"This wallet has high capacity, but with that comes a some problems. It is big and bulky It would extra large pockets to carry this wallet around. The quality was very good. If you carry you wallet in a briefcase or a man bag, this might work for you. I returned the product (no problem, as usual with Amazon)."
1.0,This cover up is nothing like the picture.  Same colours but missing the rest of the material! Pic shows model wearing it with a belt. No way that could happen! Definitely NOT happening. Buyer beware. Fits my 7 year old. Very disappointed with this. Doesn’t deserve a star at all.
1.0,The sunglasses I received are not the same as pictured (multi)  the glasses I received have gold frames like the other 2 colors
1.0,"Way too small, ordered 2 sizes bigger and still small, gave it to good will."
1.0,It's basically a bathing suit and if you have any boobs at all this will barely cover your aereola. I do not recommend
1.0,Awful material and nowhere near a size 2x.
1.0,The item that I received is nothing at all like the photo shown on the website. I am very upset because the photo that was shown is a pattern match to several other bags I have. I will be contacting the seller to see how I can get rid of this awful item and maybe get credited.
1.0,"So this has to be one of the sketchy-est clothing items i've received. It didn't have a size on it (which i didn't realize when I ordered it), when I got it, it has a weird smell to it..a little like gasolline. I just washed it and it still has the smell thats really toxic. I washed it with other clothes and the smell seems to have transmitted to my other clothes as well. It also comes in some weird asian wrapping with an asian tag and thats about it. I wouldn't buy this, just go to the store or order something else."
1.0,"The earrings are pretty but the clip on is very painful, can't wear them."
1.0,Magnet isn't even strong enough to stay in. Useless.
1.0,Looks cheap compared to the pictures
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture very disappointed had to return
1.0,"I have 2 daith piercings. Initially these earrings didn't bother me but, after about a week, my left ear was hot and itchy. It was oozing too. It took a lot of care to stop the pain. Since they're 2 different types I left the right earring in. A few days after taking the left out, the right started to be painful as well. Both were green when I took them out. These ARE NOT hypoallergenic."
1.0,I ordered large and the socks I received have no size on the bag or on the sock. These are very tight and uncomfortable.
1.0,"Item was in a non-factory bag,  tags missing,  SOILED (grease spots on the chest) &<br />obviously was previously worn by someone!.<br />Very disappointed."
1.0,"The dress is super cute and fit nice, but it is 90% polyester not rayon as described. Since I bought the dress for warm weather, polyester is not going to work. So sad because I really liked the dress, but I had to return it today.<br />For sizing, I am 38 C  with 44"" around the belly and hips. I wear a large or XL. Got this in the XL because I carry my weight in the middle and it fit well (not clingly or baggy)."
1.0,"Super cute, very cheap!  Would not buy again.<br /><br />Gave it to my daughter to play with."
1.0,Very cheap looking. I returned
1.0,The charms are way way too big and consume too much space
1.0,I don’t like it coz the quality is poor and I think it is for baby not for adults
1.0,The dress was coming apart at the seams before my daughter could even wear it. Had purchased a frozen one that was similar in style and it’s still wearing well.
1.0,Way to small and has Sharpe edges on it
1.0,Ok but the lock is not as nice or as quality made as the lock laces are
1.0,"Lens fell out on the 2nd day ,so. I had<br />to throw away that pair!!!"
1.0,Nothing special. A regular mask.
1.0,These would not fit on my gear fit 2. I've attached pictures. You can see the metal on the purple bands is a little bit bigger than the original blue bands. It prevents the bands from sliding in far enough to let them snap into place.
1.0,Runs very small and material is flimsy
1.0,Ill-fitting; does not fit like it does on the model.
1.0,Raggedy should be ashame to sell anyone that crap.
1.0,Rainbow! It is not WHITE STRINGS I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MAN HOODIE BUT WITH RAINBOW STINGS PROBABLY NOT! Also it’s extremely thin like a long sleeve shirt not a warm hoodie.
1.0,I was very disappointed. There were two different types of sunglasses pictured.
1.0,"The holes in these jeans are actual holes. No material (white threading) like usual destroyed jeans with holes, they are actual holes, completely exposing your thigh. Returned as I couldn't wear these to work. They fit true to size, and like the other comments, they are spandex material. Which would be comfortable, but just be aware they aren't actual jeans."
1.0,The dress is beautiful but I receive the wrong dress. I picked the short one and received the long prom looking dress. I planned on wearing it for my birthday but was disappointed. Never will I ever order from this company again
1.0,It’s already starting to turn a coppery shade. Plus it’s pretty heavy for a belly ring.
1.0,NOT AS PICTURED<br />CHEESE AND CRACKERS!! I realize this is not an expensive ring but it should look the way it’s pictured. The ring I received has almost none of the detail the ring pictured has. Perhaps maybe the seller can take a picture of one of the actual rings they sell instead of what is currently there. What a waste of time.
1.0,to wide
1.0,NOT WHAT WAS DESCRIBED
1.0,"I have another great pair of socks from this company. HOWEVER, this particular pair was starting to fall apart when I received it. The quality is terrible compared to my other pair of socks. Very disappointed. For $15, I expected more."
1.0,"Came with no drawstring.  Doesn't matter... Way too small for a regular adult anyway.  Amazon issued a refund.  From the other reviews saying the string came out or won't stay snug, these need to be made with an elastic band."
1.0,The shoes are cute and fit perfectly but there is nothing to hold the strap across the shoe. The strap attaches to absolutely nothing so the shoes are useless for my 7 year old because they slip off. I can’t even find a way to return them and now it says they’re no longer available. They would have been the perfect shoes if there were actually a buckle to strap the shoes on!
1.0,Cute pants but poor quality. My 9 y.o. wore them for a few hours and the material started to peel off. She also said they were very hot and they stuck to her legs.
1.0,Way too small!  I would have given it 0 stars but it is not allowed by Amazon.  Sending it back!
1.0,Wasn't the colors I expected. Too orange of<br />Spots
1.0,Not what I was expecting as they are more like cos play.
1.0,"Whomever cut and sized these is an idiot.  I'm an Army vet, and I know cammies/tac pants are supposed to be a bit loose, but these fit like some kind of clown pants.  I am 6'1&#34;, and weigh anywhere from 190-200.  I typically wear a 36 waist and 34 inseam, and ordered the Large-Long size of these; my normal size for cammies.  The waist adjustment tabs won't stay put when tightened, and even with them pulled tight and wearing a belt, the legs, seat, and crotch could still fit about another whole or 1/2 of me in them.  These are ridiculously huge.<br />Evidently, these, too, are yet another U.S. military-style product made by some foreign joint, or at least just fools who've no idea how to properly cut and size clothing.<br />The score so far:  Propper's cammies are lousy, and their Genuine Gear is junk.  And evidently, Tru Spec's camo pants are also absolute crap, as well.  I guess we're just out of luck if we no longer have access to a PX or BX or the post/base Clothing & Sales facility. Best of luck to anyone else looking for good cammies.  It'd be nice to find good, actually American made ones that aren't outrageously pricey."
1.0,think of toddler sizes...
1.0,came with strap broken
1.0,The print on the shirt was smeared.
1.0,Hems not properly stitched
1.0,"The texture of the watch bands is horrible to the touch; they are itchy, sweaty and uncomfortable to wear, so after 2 days I gave up wearing them.  I had previously purchased a different brand of a nylon watch band last year and was very satisfied with the product. It was getting shabby so I wanted to replace. I made the mistake of not buying the same brand again. I would not recommend this product."
1.0,Broken peices.  Can't fill my orders due to not having enough of the peices!!!!
1.0,"It is a good looking shoe, but incredibly unstable due to the narrowness of the center of the bottom of the shoe. You will literally break your neck. Poor design for a platform."
1.0,"I've now bought and returned 5 (FIVE) terrible quality watch bands! They are just outright awful!!! From shoddy stitching, misaligned lug holes, splitting and painted(?) Leather that peels off after one wear. I actually had one that the lug holes ripped while putting it on the watch for the first time... And I'm no rookie. I've been collecting watches for decades. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,This earring is very poor quality.  I wanted to try it on and the post broke off.  I have shopped for hundreds of earrings and it has never happened before
1.0,Sizing is way off. This is so small!
1.0,"Already have rose gold large hoops that I like from this company & wanted these small ones.<br />BUT the end that actually pokes through your ear is flat!!! There’s no taper or point & it’s too thick to get through my ear.<br />(I’ve had pierced ears for 45 yrs & have NEVER encountered this, so it’s not my ears.)<br /><br />I tried & tried to shove them through until it hurt. Gave up & tried the next day - finally pushed them through & they hurt. I could actually feel them on which is absurd.<br />Couldn’t wear earrings for a couple days after that until whatever I did to get these on had healed.<br /><br />It’s a shame because these are really pretty - but UNWEARABLE. Waste of money.<br />**UPDATE** 2 days later, my earlobes where the hoops touched still has red, peeling skin. Definitely some sort of funky metal used, as I’m not allergic to anything & have never reacted to earrings before. What a disappointment. You get what you pay for, I guess, & these were cheap."
1.0,Way too big. No shape.
1.0,One ear ring broke when removing the back from packaging. I submitted a claim to amazon and the replacement arrived broken. The pin is breaking off the charm. Stay away. I returned both and will not be buying again.<br /><br />The charm part actually looks good.
1.0,Order a 2x got a large
1.0,"The compass didn't work. The light was also super dim, leaving a lot to be desired."
1.0,They don't even look like hearts in person! Disappointed -_-
1.0,"I know these were inexpensive, but my brother ordered the same Cosmos brand headbands and received WAY higher quality headbands. His are bulkier and more absorbent and mine are thin and feel like old lady nylons...and they took over a month to arrive after ordering."
1.0,Clasps appear solid but the color looks off. It is very yellow
1.0,Charged it when I received it and it doesn’t work!! Contacted seller and never heard back from them.. it’s going back!!
1.0,Didn't work for me. Doesn't mean it won't work for someone else. Made glare even worse.  Just turned everything yellow and much brighter. Frame and lens are very well built though.
1.0,"Well the product is not as advertised. I purchased the green and was excepting a delicate nude color lace on the top as advertised no..... It looked like someone accidentally washed it with red. So lovely green color with weird pink trim. Ugly. I refuse to wear this for my man, he deserves better. This is Not delicate or attractive. Too bad because the garment itself is so soft. I am returning this ugly false advertised product. Thank you Amazon vendor for not putting a true photograph of what you are actually selling ... Honestly how hard is it ? You have the product take an accurate photo of what is you are selling."
1.0,Poorly stitched<br />Crouch in seem ripped open after one ride on motorcycle.<br />Bought 2 sizes too big in order to have it fit over my regular clothes.
1.0,"This is so poor quality, I feel bad donating it to The fabric is so cheap and the seamstress work on this is just sad! Because supplier is in China, it won’t cover shipping cost for return so it makes no economic sense to return it. Not other option than to use this as a floor cleaning rag."
1.0,"Not what I was expecting the item to look like at all. The color is totally off. The green was dark, and almost black looking. More of a thin sweater than the coat it looks like in the picture. Returned, not happy with purchase. Mostly upset about the color, loved the emerald green in the picture."
1.0,Back came apart after a week
1.0,This item is NOT leather. It is PLASTIC!!!!!!!!!!<br />CHEAPLY MADE!!!!
1.0,"Don't waste your time. Beautiful dress, poorly put together."
1.0,"Strideline socks are terrific.  These are Strideline knock-offs. Exceptionally small, weird cut, and scratchy uncomfortable material.  Who knew there was such a thing as knock-off socks?!"
1.0,First time I grabbed something very hot it burnt my hands through the gloves. Very Poor Quality.  Said Heat & Fire resistant but isn't even close to protecting the hands from heat. My regular work gloves are much better but I wanted the length.
1.0,Cheap and broken
1.0,After wearing watch band for two weeks the glitter cracked and fell off
1.0,very very cheaply made !! broke first time on !!
1.0,"I received my item and it was fine, nothing spectacular"
1.0,To tight and seems likes it is made in width for a kids or small persons face. Unable to wear. Disappointed. Also the spiderman emblem does not go over your face. It hangs way past your mouth down by your neck.
1.0,"Great looking belt and initially loved it. But after wearing this belt daily for about a month, the buckle broke.  The pin holding the metal hinge on the buckle just fell out and the buckle fell apart."
1.0,"I ordered a black, purple, and gold one, but received a bright turquoise and pink one??"
1.0,The sell was great but the product is terribe don't order anything coming from china if a rip off.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:ba3e9927931d4cce4628ee5404b73f00]] So I have a formal event and ordered this black wristlet to hold my necessities. The bag came with the wrong strap, a cheap nylon version that is half black half orange, and it won't unzip all the way. Because of this it also won't open all the way. It also has tan on it and is not solid black. I thuroughly regret this purchase and would give one star if I could."
1.0,First of all it is small for my ears and it does not stay on. And I fear that I will lose them soon.
1.0,Sizes are way off running very small
1.0,not good quality and sizing is way off
1.0,All the color just washes out. Gave to a friend of my daughters for her birthday and the color was just gone after first wash.
1.0,"The switch inside the shoes will irritate, and even hurt, your foot. Plus, the wheels don't roll as fast as the ones on the Heelyes. Apparently, this is a copy-cat made from China. Don't buy this."
1.0,Not long enough and discolored in less than 24 hours. :-(
1.0,"I bought two of these, and each one broke after one day of use. The plastic used to make their frames is terrible."
1.0,"these glasses are not what I had expected, the color wasn't up to me standards.  I the price was alright though."
1.0,"These shoes are complete junk. They started falling apart the FIRST DAY I WORE THEM. The soles are falling off and the laces were almost completely ripped in a week. Such much for Timberland being a great, reliable brand. Move your factory out of China or whatever junk-making place you make your shoes in now."
1.0,"The craftsmanship and quality is terrible. The prongs aren't sturdy at all and the pendant arrived with some of the stones fallen out of the setting due to the wobbly prongs. Also, it was advertised with a 18"" chain but only came with the pendant. Very disappointed. Would not recommend this item or this seller."
1.0,Poor quality falling apart
1.0,"I am really disappointed with these boots! You definitely get what you pay for with this purchase. Poorly made, and they smell horrible as well. When I didn’t see a review for these boots to begin with,it should have been an indication that something was wrong.  Next time I’ll know better."
1.0,"This would be fine if you are very slight, too small for me."
1.0,"horrible!! it was like wrapping a tuna can around my finger, sooo flimsy and cheap! also turned my finger green; I gave to my 4 yr old daughter for dress-up."
1.0,"Very, very cheap looking. It's just a piece of material stitched together. Doesn't even look like denim. Very disappointed."
1.0,Breatheable piece kept popping off and eventually broke off.
1.0,They where way to small
1.0,Lowest quality . It is not thick and worms in opposite picture.
1.0,DONT waste your $ or Time buying this product. It’s not as advertised and the material is super itchy! I paid $114 for the item and was only refunded $95.23 and had to pay additional $25 to return the product to the company. Save yourself the headache and keep your hard earned cash!  Wouldn’t give them any stars
1.0,The balls brake before you can get them on.
1.0,"Don't waist your money, doesn't look like picture and turned my wife's neck Green. 1 star cause that's the lowest it goes."
1.0,Ring looks pretty but runs small and doesn't change colors. It's been on this ugly color since I received it 3 days ago.
1.0,Poor quality. The flower is just hanging and folded. Color looks like royal blue in the picture but I received navy blue with poor quality cloth. Unsatisfactory
1.0,These are a size XXL ... My son wears a Medium and they fit him perfectly !!<br /><br />These must be from that Chinese size chart.<br /><br />Not Happy with this purchase !!
1.0,"I went to reduce the size of the belt by removing the screw from the leather and cutting off about 2 inches.  Upon refitting the buckle onto the leather and pressing the screw through and into the threaded punch, the head of the screw cracked.  I could not find a replacement screw, so i just bought a cheaper belt and used that screw."
1.0,The worse piece of clothing I ever received.
1.0,do not recommend; pajama material
1.0,"I bought the red one, and it’s actually a coral pink. I couldn’t wear it with my Halloween costume."
1.0,Item was cracked on one side and did not look like what I expectd.
1.0,"I am now so Leary of buying clothing online. I didn't have any problems before, but man the skirt is bad! It came in a crumpled ball, and doesn't look anything like the picture! It looks messy, and it's just so bad that it's made me hesitant to buy anything. I'm a frequent customer on Amazon. But this skirt! I really should have sent it back! I do not recommend. I wish there was a negative star review option for this one!"
1.0,SOoooo much smaller than what the picture shows! I would’ve never bought it if I knew! Even though I read the reviews I wasn’t expecting such a big difference! :(
1.0,"What a horrible quality product. All wrinkled, it’s not white, it has no tag and it looks used… well, I got what I paid for. Definitely returning."
1.0,Product was ordered in a large womens and only fits my 6 yr old whos a large in girls
1.0,"I wear 9.5, ordered a 10, shoes dont even fit me."
1.0,"The dress looks beautiful in the photo. I ordered the solid light blue dress. What I got was a blue and white striped nightmare. Made of cheap Halloween costume material. If you're over 5'4 you can't even use as a dress. I'm astounded at the terrible quality. I still tried it on and I looked like a picnic tablecloth, or a drunk pirate, can't decide which. Please don't waste your money on this. :("
1.0,Bad product it turn colors already
1.0,"These items were a complete waste of money. I ordered them to layer under my work uniform. The first day I wore one, it was frayed and practically shredded around the neck and arms. The seams came undone and it was practically falling apart. Do not recommend."
1.0,It was cute out of the box but did not hold up for long. The bow fell off within a few minutes and never made it into school for a holiday themed<br />day.
1.0,"After reading reviews,  I ordered a size 10;I normally wear a 9.<br />WAYYYYYY TO BIG. I didn't get them returned in time but I REALLY wanted this boot, so I ordered a size 8, remember, I normally wear a 9. Still way too big. I returned them, without trying a size 7. If they want to ship me a size 7 at no cost, I'd gladly change my review...."
1.0,The belt buckle didn’t have a back on it and I dug into my abdomen!
1.0,I CAN'T believe these shade didn't &#34;fit.&#34;  I have NEVER come across a pair of glasses or shades that didn't sit right on my nose.  What a waste of time!
1.0,They run extremely too big  and when she has them on the button or switch hurts her ankle really bad not very please with the product would not recommend
1.0,This bathing does not fit right top part is extra material near underarms.  It was hard to put it on since for some reason it doesn’t stretch like a bathing suit supposed to. Not sure what type of material was actually used but it never experience it on any other brand bathing suit in my life.
1.0,Poor construction.  Too small to stay on a man's head unless you keep absolutely still.
1.0,Came out of the dryer covered in fuzz balls. I threw it right into trash!
1.0,Absolutely horrible this purse is nice but the fact that the inside smells like rotten fish that was cooking in the hot summer day unbelievable horrible. It took three rounds of dryer sheets Plus putting lavender on cotton balls to get this horrifics smell to go away
1.0,"I am skinny, 100 lbs, wear an 8 . I ordered the medium then washed in slightly warm water before I tried them on after and can’t even pull them on. Complete waste of money."
1.0,This necklace is terrible!  I wore it for a few days and the rose gold came off and it broke at the adjustable chain.  It’s not worth the money at all.
1.0,I bought a few sizes larger and it’s still super small. The sizing for XL is like a small. Material is VERY cheap and took long time for delivery!
1.0,It was a beautiful design but very poorly and cheaply made.
1.0,The dress is not what shows on the picture. Quality is poor there is no way someone can wear it cause you will be showing every part of your body.😕
1.0,Im so maddd..I should've tested each one of them before I put it in goodie bags.  Only 10 of them probably worked out of 40. I had over 70 kids at my party and for them to come up and ask why it didn't work was so sadddd.
1.0,"Ordered XL, followed previous reviews of it running small, ordered a size larger. Zipper ripped upon 1st try on"
1.0,"Love the color, but the sizing was way off. I measured to fit the shoulders and bust, but everything else was way to big."
1.0,These are not denim jeans. This is some kind of stretchy jogging like material. Not at all like the picture. The crotch is super long and the legs are too short.
1.0,Child size.
1.0,"I open it and it’s missing one of the balls so when I put it on it comes off, pretty disappointed.."
1.0,For XL it is super big should have taken M
1.0,Returned. Item was like3 sizes to small.
1.0,cheaply made stickers as label
1.0,Way to small. Not what was expected.  I'm usually a 2x ordered a 5x. Was still Way to small.  Material was stretchy. Arms were very narrow
1.0,"This is very low quality. I was afraid I was going to wreck it just opening it. You can absolutely forget if a baby gust of wind comes along. This thing will turn inside-out. Was going to return it but life kept happening and well, we didnt get around to it. I will update this when we get a chance to use it and let you know if it really did wreck."
1.0,Very plain dress. Definitely not as cute ad expected
1.0,"Compared to others this was very thin & way too big for a 6 month old baby. The arms are too long, the Velcro on the neck is spaced too far. More for a toddler I would say that isn’t that messy."
1.0,"I was very surprised & disappointed when I received my order. I bought what I thought was a 3 pack of the pom-pom leg warmers(they're pics of them make them look just like that) & it turned out that they aren't really leg warmers at all. They're boot cuffs made to stick out of the top of boots. This makes no sense to me at all considering that nowhere in the description of the pom-pom ones does it say anything about them being boot cuffs. Also, if they're just boot cuffs, then why do they give u 4 of each color & package them to look like each is 1 leg warmer?"
1.0,Bad quality. My 3 years old son wear them Teo times and they are already broken un the front. Bad decision...
1.0,Cheap look !!! Returned it even though I had to pay $10 for shipping.
1.0,Button holes were to small and the sizing was way off. You can roll the dice as far as correct sizing goes!!!!
1.0,"I wish I could give this zero stars. This thing is way too small. Because it is so small the face piece nearly covers my eyes, the back of the hood leaves my neck totally exposed and the seam sits in a way that there's a weird nipple on the top of my head. I bought this for snow boarding and there's no way I will be able to use it since I would be going down the mountain totally blind. I'm a 5'7 woman with short hair and what I assume to be a normal sized head. Don't buy this. It sucks."
1.0,"These boxers run very small, the patterns/colors repeat so you only get 6 pairs and their duplicate. They also have no seam up the back so you end up with a wad of fabric in the back of your pants."
1.0,"too small (and i ordered a size LARGE!)  poorly made, cheap fabric.  don't recommend the manufacturer, nor the supplier.  very dishonest people."
1.0,"I ordered a 2xl. Aside from the sleeves being 4in too short, this will not even cover my boobs! It will fit my preteen but not a DD chest!"
1.0,"I bought two pieces of this watch.I want to return one of them. I want to get me to change it to a new one. Because one of them was used before it was sent to me.Visible scratches on the body. On the bracelet - the haze of wear. In the package there is no manual, but in the second pack there is one."
1.0,Completely see through and without a second whole shirt the same design you'd block the cute sleeves that show off your shoulders. So short of doubling the price or becoming an exhibitionist you'll end up returning these.
1.0,The ring is nothing like it shows in this picture!!!<br />I will never purchase anything from them again.<br />I WANT TO SEND IT BACK.  WHAT CAN I DO IN<br />ORDER TO DO THIS?
1.0,"One was broken, the other I couldn't open! It wasn't worth my sending it back cause it wasn't that expensive."
1.0,"I usually never write reviews but I have to on this. The dress in the picture looks amazing, hence why I ordered it. Once I received it, I was beyond disappointed. In the picture it looks like a cute tank top with a flared out bottom. The real thing clinches to you like there's no tomorrow. I'm very disappointed. The fabric is horrible and not comfortable at all. It was cheap, so I guess you get what you paid for."
1.0,"I wish I could give this no stars. I am usually a size small, but I ordered a large. I couldn't even figure out how to get into this romper. The strap popped off as I was trying to get it over my head. Not worth the money or the time waiting for it to ship."
1.0,"I normally buy a small size. I bought this in a medium to make sure it fits. When I received this shirt and tried to put it on, the sleeve is so tight couldn't even get it on."
1.0,Product does not come as pictured. Arm areas are completely different shapes.
1.0,"Flimsy and cheap, way overpriced."
1.0,"I bought this one because it was supposed to come with the axe (Stormbreaker) hammer (Mjolnir), beard and keychain for a complete ""Fat Thor"" costume.  I only received the axe.  I was as expected though a foam cosplay axe of solid quality. The dimensions are as stated in the description.  I found the prop, quality and shipping to be 5 stars.  The 1 star review is because it does not come with all of the products shown, or described.  I would have been extremely happy if all of the products came as advertised but they did not."
1.0,The sizing was very off for this product. Way smaller then it should have been
1.0,These fit my husband when he tried them on.  We washed once and they shrunk at least 2 sizes.  Never even got to wear them.  Do not buy.
1.0,These gloves continuously rolled down and ripped open within 10 minutes of wearing. Luckily they were only for Halloween but I’d recommend spending money elsewhere.
1.0,I doubt it would fit a child head less on an adult. !! Not worth it
1.0,Poor visual quality. Don’t buy this. Cute but is useless.
1.0,I loved the photo here and did not like the actual garment.
1.0,"The shirt was sized appropriately, however the pants ran almost two sizes too small. I am returning them"
1.0,It doesn’t keep the sweat from your eyes jack
1.0,The pockets are so high they were on my breasts!! Very weird and does not look good.
1.0,Had to order twice. First one came with the plastic container only.. than it was reordered and it came with a silver buckle not gold
1.0,Very cute dress. However after one wash it looks like I have owned the dress for a year. It just falls apart. I washed this on delicates in cold water wand it is pulling and it just looks raggedy. I have bought multiple dresses similar and they stoill look great months later. Very disappointed
1.0,The earrings did not fit into the post!  Cannot be worn.
1.0,"Cheap flimsy skirt,  all the buttons fell off!"
1.0,"These were not kid sized. Fell off my child, not even close to fitting."
1.0,"As soon as I opened the package majority of the back pieces to the charms were off and when I tried to put the charms onto the crocs they all fell off .. cheap plastic material glued on by a hot glue gun ,don’t waste your money."
1.0,"People don't waste your money.<br />After my granddaughter wore the dress for Easter we decided to rinse it in some fabric softener just as it went into the water all of the flowers disappeared the dress was completed white immediately,all except for the pink band.Sooooooooo disappointed."
1.0,This is not mad for large breasted women. I wear a 36DD and it was way to small
1.0,Too short. Barely below waistb
1.0,Should be sold at the dollar store
1.0,The zipper broke off almost immediately and it didn't even zip to begin with. Waste of time and money.
1.0,Product different then pic
1.0,The dress came super wrinkly so i used a steam Iron in it and it stained water spots on it.
1.0,I loved this band when I opened the package. I ordered lilac and it was the perfect color. Band is super soft and felt comfortable HOWEVER no matter how many times I attached it and reattached it the band won’t stay connected. The stock Fitbit bands have plastic ends that clip into the pin area- these are all soft silicone and pull right out . Super disappointed.
1.0,"Had to send back, way to big"
1.0,Way to small. Sizes are not what advertised
1.0,Make sure your toe nails are trimmed neatly! The tear very easy. They run tight and long compared to other brands.
1.0,"I'm short, 5'1, and the jeans came up to the bottom of my butt. Also, they look nothing like the picture."
1.0,"It looked normal on the website, but when my brother put it on he looked so ridiculous he won't wear it. He had just wanted a normal smile. I'm going to try to get one made on Shutterfly."
1.0,Ordered a medium and it literally fit like a 3 XL
1.0,"Just a cheap outfit. The leg warmers are nice, anything else is stiff and cheap."
1.0,"The black coating on the sunglasses started peeling after one day of wearing these in Mexico on vacation - really cheap, poor quality!"
1.0,Cheap and tiny
1.0,"looks cheap, came bent, extremely dissatisfied.  My advice, do not purchase"
1.0,"This robe, although soft and comfortable fell apart.<br />The first time I wore it the pockets fell off!"
1.0,Make same style NO BIFOCAL. Will repurchase if no bifocal
1.0,"Made very cheap, and material is very thin  will never never order again I advise not to order it very disiopoting"
1.0,Did not like it. To start with it has sleeves and the picture does not show that. Also it's to big and baggy on the belly area. To much money for nothing.
1.0,Cheaply made.. 2 of the necklaces have broken.
1.0,It was not the one I ordered and it was to small
1.0,Horrible.  Too small.  Super cheap looking.  I want my money back!
1.0,I bought my size and it is very small on the hips
1.0,The nurse is nice for the price but made extremely to small for the size!
1.0,I literally just took this out of the bag and there are holes in it and thread hanging off
1.0,I bought a large dress and it was too small for me.
1.0,XL size is very small!! Maybe someone that is a size six can fit!!
1.0,"They will not stay up, they fall into my shoes.  Absolutely worthless."
1.0,does not stay put crooked looks better on line
1.0,"Falling off, very unstable<br />I guess its only nice for crib with no crawling or walking"
1.0,Zipper is cheaply made and broke upon trying to put the dress on.
1.0,Does not look good and cheap shinny fabric !<br />Even the fitting was horrible around the waist making you look more big around waist
1.0,Thr belt was too small  I have a 44 waist Quality was good. To bad for me
1.0,This necklace is not made well and is not flexible when expect it to be. Pass on this necklace. You'll thank me.
1.0,I disliked that the product look very cheap. I was thinking it would look exactly like the picture but I was wrong. Will not purchase again.<br />Respectfully
1.0,Bad.<br />It's not a cotton! Polyester 100%. Why the company lying?!!!
1.0,"I received package long item,ㅜ.ㅜ<br />,,??????????? Check plz"
1.0,I think this kit was made to be used by little elves or small children.  It is SUPER tiny!!!  I sent it back.
1.0,"Awful product. First of all, it calls it a leather band but it’s definitely super cheap plastic not even nice enough to resemble leather. My daughter wore this for one week before condensation began forming on the inside, making it impossible to read. Now, one month after I purchased it, it’s full of mildew and has to be thrown away. Total waste of money."
1.0,Bought this for someone as a birthday gift. She wasn't too impressed. Thought it looked cheap
1.0,"Not happy with this product. It is not sufficiently bright to illuminate the road ahead while running, the belt gets bigger as you run, and, after only a few uses, it doesn’t work."
1.0,Breaks very easily and lose its shape . Will not buy it again.
1.0,Broke in like a week. Also the pink color gets dirty pretty easily.
1.0,One lens has very little polorization and th other is strong. When wareing the glasses it Give you a weird effect. I can not ware them. Would like to have them replaced.
1.0,Lamentablemente nunca llego
1.0,It snags on anything and everything and then it stretches to the point I took it off because I was scared it was going to break.
1.0,No me agradó. Los eslabones son muy pequeños distinto a la foto de promoción.
1.0,SUPER CHEAP LOOKING
1.0,Top was at least 3 sizes too small!
1.0,These are so narrow. I don't have fat feet but my little toes hung off the edge. Very uncomfortable!
1.0,Arrived broken 😩.
1.0,It’s a really cute band and I really would have liked used it but as soon as I put it on it broke broke
1.0,"I LOVE THIS SHIRT SO MUCH!!!!!!! i would buy every single one if i could. however, i give it a one star because it fit everywhere except for the chest area. It was waaaay too small and flattened my boobs so much i couldn't even pretend it fit :( I typically wear a Medium/Large in shirts for reference. Hopefully this company will eventually make different sizes in shirts so i can purchase this again (had to return it)."
1.0,Got a large for a an oversized look.<br />It’s just a size large that is a little longer and the arms look too big.<br />Plus side the design is cute and clear and the fabric is very soft.
1.0,"I liked the cute musician graphic and ordered this t-shirt on impulse for summer wear.  It has an odd, short, boxy fit that isn't that obvious on the model in the picture.  Not flattering for me, or anyone, really.  The size Small I ordered could probably be worn by someone much larger than me ?!? - and look odd on them too."
1.0,Broken right out of box!
1.0,"Lo peor, no cierran. Demasiado pequeños"
1.0,After 2 week of using the bag star ripping off.
1.0,After 5 hours of wearing it started ripping and having holes in it.
1.0,I loved this dress when I bought it and tried it on. Planned to wear it to my best friends bridal shower. Washed it on cold and hung it to dry to avoid shrinking in the dryer. I put it on the morning of the shower and it shrunk nearly 2 sizes! Mind you I tried it on 2 days prior so unless I gained 30 lbs overnight it wasn’t me. I had to scramble to find something else to wear and I’m very unhappy!! Of course it’s past my return date too! Don’t buy!
1.0,"Not happy at all, the pockets are not big enough and very poorly made, only ordered it a month ago, and already falling a part, will not order again!"
1.0,WAYYYYY to tight. The material doesn't stretch at all.
1.0,The material is exactly what you could compare to a restaurant table cloth but a bit thinner
1.0,"Extremely cheap. Not leather suede as advertised- they are made with what feels like a polyester faux-suede. Horrid stitching. The sole of the shoe is WHITE and does not bend. Very stiff. Ugly shoes. Awful manufacturing. They arrived in a ziploc baggie, not a box. Clearly sprayed with something to make them smell as if they were leather but it’s obvious they are not. I requested a refund. I couldn’t choose a zero star rating so one star will have to do."
1.0,This product is a waste. The buckles fall off! I couldn’t walk to my bathroom to my living room with out it falling off my shirt. Very disappointed
1.0,"Do not by this product even for the penny. It will cost you more for shipping than it is worth. It is not even 1/50th in width despite coming in 18"" 20"" and 22'."
1.0,"Delivery was quick.  I am glad I read about the sizes.  It is extremely small.  I like my shirts loose.  Even going up to the largest size, it is still tight.  I am not huge person .  I wear a 1x normally.  And that is loose.  I bought a 3xl and it is tight.  I am scared to wash.  I am not happy at all.  I really wanted this shirt."
1.0,Broke the first time my FIL wore it.
1.0,Like the thin band look; but band so thin that it broke (irrepairably) where the band 'hooks' to the watch face.
1.0,Wow! I bought this costume last year and realized it was completely inappropriate and problematic.
1.0,"I purchased a pair of these a good while back, and absolutely loved them. They started to get a bit worn around the heels (I like my pants to hang over my shoes, this is my fault) so I decided to grab another pair to keep as a backup. I just found my original order, and reordered them. They sat for a few months, as I didn't need them.<br /><br />Fast forward to yesterday...<br /><br />They are not the same fabric. The first pair was somewhat stiff, almost like a canvas but softer. It held its shape and felt really nice to wear.<br /><br />The fabric on these are like dinky curtain fabric. They blow around in the wind like nobody's business. It is too late for a refund, again, my fault, I should have checked when I ordered them. The pocket flaps don't hold firm like the first pair, and look horrible. I put an iron to it, but it would need some starch or something to get it to even be remotely close to the first pair I had ordered."
1.0,It took 2 months to receive these earring cuffs . They come closer do u must open them in order to put on ur ears of course 6 of the cuffs broke in half. Don’t waste money or time. Very disappointed
1.0,The stone is way bigger than expected and it snags in everything. I have only had it in for one night and I hate it.
1.0,"The product is too large, and it does not fit all sizes, even when my head is not a small one. One of the elastic bands came broken, and, on top of that, they are just for decoration. If you want to adjust the size to your face, they won't help.<br />Also, from the picture shown, I thought it would offer some kind of protection for my neck as well. Turns out is too big for your head but too short to cover at least some part of your neck."
1.0,Horrible the ring size did not measure up. The hoop constantly scratched my nose. When I went to pull it out one of the stones was missing. The stone that was missing cause the hoop to scratch my nose. It was extremely painful to get out. I will never use this company again.
1.0,Came broken in 7 pieces and missing a charm
1.0,Like wearing stretchy plastic. Not remotely comfortable.
1.0,"Same as the necklace I brought this is junk would not stay on my wife wrist, kept falling off"
1.0,9 out of 10 of these the stones fell out of.  The pieces that screw into the stem are so tiny you cant fit it between your fingers and still see what your doing. Very complicated and took way to long to put on
1.0,I like these leggings but the seam on the leg is so fragile and they were delivered to me with two holes.
1.0,Was not happy in the quality or size. Purchased for my daughter and she can not wear it. At least a whole size difference. If you intend to order I would recommend ordering a size up. Also do not expect it to be of great quality. Material was very thin and not very soft. Sadly would not order again and I regret the purchase.
1.0,"This is total garbage. I didn't even have to try them on, the sole was so thin and the leather looked so fake. I just put them back in the same box and returned the very next day. I didn't get all my money back. The seller deducted without giving any notification. But I didn't even wear them. I just don't understand why they would do that. Do yourself a favor and buy something good, even if cost you little more money.. this product is total garbage."
1.0,Way to small 😡
1.0,This is junk!!  This broke after only a couple of months of very light use - the top loop broke off and the spring went flying.  Also - the design of the top loop limits the type of key that will fit on it (like a typical or Lincoln car key... will not fit due to small opening on key chain).  I suggest that you find another option for a key chain.  Bad Bad Bad.
1.0,Not american sizing.
1.0,"I got a 2x because I wanted it to be large. It wasn't sweatshirt material, but rather like a long sleeved t-shirt, and was NOT a 2x. I could barely get it over my head. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Sorry, but I would not recommend this watch band. It is extremely stiff and inflexible. I put it on a Garmin Fenix 6 and instantly took it off. Instead of being a single strap, it has a metal 'hinge' that is then attached to the watch. This adds a jiggle to the fit and the band is so stiff, that it just rides over your wrist instead of actually conforming to your wrist. I imagine if enough time is given, it might become more flexible, but man, out of the bag it is horrible."
1.0,"It's very cheaply made, and simply awful material. Itchy and pretty snug for a large. Huge disappointment."
1.0,No I wouldn't buy these again. Every time the dogs shake their heads the little bells go flying all over the place. Instead of being stitched on they are glued on. They are worth about $1.00 each.
1.0,They suck! The stones fell already! 😠
1.0,It’s a nice color but fabric is horrible
1.0,"Nothing to like. It's a really awful jumpsuit. Would not even think of trying on but I can say this. I am 5'5"" , weigh 100 pounds and am a size 4. Ordered the 6 due to size comments. As I held it up to my front, length was a minimum 6 -8"" too long."
1.0,Purchased mala Tiger Beads.  They were poor quality and one bead was chipped. Also there was no tazzle which Tibetan Mala Beads normally have.  Disappointing....
1.0,It’s a three pack and only one fit as it should. Won’t purchase again.
1.0,"Did not have full saying on moon, it only said &#34;to the moon and back&#34;. I was very disappointed."
1.0,"Came fine, looked good. Put them in, and they had a weird chemical smell. Tried to clean to make it better, it didn't work. Then my ears got dry and flakey. I had to take them out and now I have to wait for my ears to heal. Do not recommend."
1.0,hard to explain but they dont fit on the back of the foot correctly.  Ill have to get a pic.  avoid and try something else
1.0,Fell apart first time I wore them.
1.0,"I thought it was cotton.  It’s some kind of flimsy polyester that I could never get the wrinkles out of.  Tried knocking the wrinkles out in the dryer and by ironing it.  Decided to send it back.  For the price I paid, it wasn’t a good buy."
1.0,"I bought a pair of these slippers (VLLY Men's Soft Thick Plush Lining) and even through I specified an 11w size, the slippers were too tight. There's no size printed on the slipper, so I can't tell what size I got. Except they were too small.  Please make sure the ones I just ordered are 11w. Thank you.<br />Jack Quinn<br />quinj1@cox.net"
1.0,Would not stay in place.  Easy to lose
1.0,"These keychains are so cute, but the two halves of the sunflower just dangle around the charm- it's not actually inside the sunflower like it looks. And the keychain broke within a day of purchase. You get what you pay for, I guess."
1.0,3 of them broke when i tried to put on. I am very disappointed
1.0,El artículo no llevo
1.0,Gaudy<br />Big
1.0,Broke after open package
1.0,over priced<br />smaller than size listed<br />stinks like cow poop
1.0,I ordered a size 7/8 my toddler is a 7 and they were WAY too small
1.0,This shirt runs very small and is super thin.
1.0,terrible! my son wore these once for swimming and in three hours they had holes everywhere. poor quality. useless.
1.0,The size is supper small than usual
1.0,"Very poor quality. It will not look like the picture, even after several attempts to fluff."
1.0,"These earrings are absolutely beautiful, but due to the design of them having a &#34;raised nodule&#34; on the inner inside of earrings instead of them being a &#34;smooth surface,&#34; they are &#34;extremely uncomfortable&#34; to wear.  They pinch your ear lobes and as a result they become &#34;numb.&#34;  I would not recommend these earrings for purchase because of their lack of &#34;comfort.&#34;"
1.0,"Only wore them 3 times, while they were comfortable when worn, they broke when pulling them out of the included sleeve. I'm surprised at how fragile the frame is."
1.0,"UPDATE: I have to update my review to lower it to 1 star. This continues to snag on everything & is even worse now that I'm starting to wear long sleeves. It has snagged my son's soccer uniform, a baby's blanket (embarrassing to send home this baby I was watching and now his favorite blanket has snags on it), a relative's shirt while giving them a hug (also embarrassing), and so many of my own clothes, hand towels, etc.  Very cheap quality. The color is also mostly gone- it was purple and is mostly silver now where the bands meet.<br /><br />I like the idea of a magnetic band. It's very easy to adjust and comfortable. The thing I don't like is that the edges are very rough and always getting caught on clothing. I've had another magnetic band that had smooth edges and never got caught on things."
1.0,"The bag was not what it appeared to be online, it is very small and the features of the bag was incorrectly described.<br />I am extremely disappointed."
1.0,My main complaint with this tie is that it is not &#34;pre-tied&#34; as advertised.  I bought this specifically because it was pre-tied and the fact that it isn't is a major inconvenience. It is not long enough for an 8 year to actually have around his neck and tie conventionally. I went to you tube for instructions on making a knot and when I do there seems to be no way to thread the neck piece through it. Although it is a cute tie and the fabric quality is ok it is basically useless to me in its current form. NOT HAPPY 😕
1.0,Worst socks I ever had. They  ARE NOT XXL even though they say it on the socks. They do not stretch and when you try to stretch it makes a ripping noise. Not even close to fitting my foot!
1.0,What came was not this item. A gummy shaped in a Coca Cola bottle came. Very disappointed!
1.0,"Extremely thin and absolutely not worth $39, rips easily and doesn't provide any warmth. It looks nice but as far as quality i give it 1 star."
1.0,"I purchased this bag to replace the one I got during my study-abroad program in Italy. Very beautiful! But unfortunately was stolen. Compared to my original, this bag left me completely and totally disappointed. It's not as good quality, the flowers/design is faded/spotty, and it simply looks as if it was a defective/less desirable product that I was sent. Knowing what they're supposed to look like versus what I got, it certainly lacked the quality and fine finish. Very unhappy with this purchase - Don't waste your money."
1.0,Way to small for any picture to go in and return policy sucks so I’m stuck with something that is no use to me
1.0,"Garment smelled like chemical's! Made in China. Not 95% cotton and 5%spandex.  Has polyester in it. Garment is soft, had to wash before wearing to to chemical smells from dye and polyester.  Would not buy again."
1.0,"Awful, looks like a cheap ass $ store"
1.0,No words to describe.<br />Will return.<br />Get the idea
1.0,The shiny material just looks inexpensive. The zipper is on the wrong side. The construction of the garment is poorly done. I do not recommend this and am returning it.
1.0,Sizing is definitely on the small side. Go 1 if not 2 sizes up from what Amazon recommends.
1.0,"The grills are not what they're advertised. They don't fit, the molders are worthless. Broke after trying  50 times to fit. The bottoms are not designed or aligned correctly. Not happy and will not purchase from this seller again."
1.0,"Super cute bracelet, wish it would’ve lasted longer. Wore it once and then it broke."
1.0,Would not recommend if you’re a size 7-8
1.0,The jacket was damaged and not sown properly from the back of the sleeve.
1.0,"The clasp doesn't work, keeps falling off!"
1.0,Terrible!!! Not true to size like advertised
1.0,you can get these on the street in NY. fake fake fake. one of the arms arleady broke off of mine. the pieces on the side(dragon logo) are loosely attached and wobbled even before that. cheap price... cheap product... wish I could get my money back.
1.0,Not Sterling silver as listed. Fake gold. Jewel is much larger. Very costume jewelry like.
1.0,Absolute garbage
1.0,Cheesy dress!
1.0,"Item was received damaged, a lot of dents and the paint was completely off."
1.0,Very displeased with the quality of this outfit. Every snap fell off the first time I tried to put it on my child. Very disappointed!
1.0,Impossible to get into and out of.....and one of the straps ripped right away!!
1.0,the lock is losing and keeps falling down
1.0,"Cute in ad picture but item was Not good quality, stitching visible, with an awkward along seam lines."
1.0,"The vest (pictured on the right) does not match cp multicam (pictured left).  The colors are way off.  I purchased this to use as a warm layer with my multicam combat shirt and pants, since the combat shirt has a t-shirt material in the chest area and is uncomfortable in the cold.<br /><br />I was also disappointed in the cut, which is not the same as the picture.  An even bottom of the vest would have worked better for me, as pictured in the product description.  The actual cut of the vest has the bottom of the front at waist level, but the back drops down lower.  You can kind of tell this if you look closely at the pictures of the models in the vest, but the pictures of the vest alone clearly show a straight cut at the bottom.  Since I wear a gear belt with my camo, this means that the back of the vest gets in the way of my belt.<br /><br />It’s not a terrible vest.  It’s gonna have to work because it’s cold now and I need something, so I’m not returning it.  Fortunately, the tan side works well enough to get me by.  The material is what I expected, so I’m happy with that.  I ordered a medium and it fits like a medium, so that’s good too.  But because this product does not fit the basic criteria of what was described (i.e. multicam and a straight cut waist), I am giving it 1 star.  If you don’t care about those things, you will probably like the vest."
1.0,"Not long enough to wear with leggings. Way too small, not heavy enough to keep you warm. I will just use mine for under a T-shirt so I have long sleeves."
1.0,In theory this would be a good thing but mine broke as soon as I put it on. Obviously I couldn't wear it which was disappointing. Only paid 16 bucks but it definitely wasn't worth it.
1.0,I ordered a large for my mother.<br />It was so small that I had to give it to my youngest sister 85 lbs.
1.0,After one wear the hook came off!!! But nice necklace!!!!
1.0,"No, No, No, No, No! This dress is a hot mess! The fabric is very stiff, and you will be squeezed in and unable to move your arms if you wear it as shown. It was tight across the shoulders and in the midsection, but really wide across the hips. I'm a size 4-6 but tall, 5'10&#34;. I knew it would be short on me, but I certainly didn't expect this stiff fabric to poke out at the hips as if it were starched. The waist was also unusually high, and this is coming from a woman with a very high waist and super long legs (36&#34; inseam).<br /> If you feel the urge to wear a hat with various varieties of fruit on your head, or you work in a Mexican restaurant that doesn't require much arm movement....THIS IS THE DRESS FOR YOU!<br />If you are a normal woman who thinks this will be a nice flowy summer dress that you can feel beautiful in.....you will be highly disappointed!"
1.0,"This dress was way too small!!! I told the people my measurements but no one listened! It was small enough to fit on a women of an average size, but way too small for me and too difficult to even try to tie!"
1.0,"El artículo lo tiraron en mi puerta en una bolsa transparente sin etiqueta, es una camisa larga delgada, nada que ver con la descripción del producto, no me gusto el fondo en la foto se ve de otro color por el material, y lo que me llegó fue una camisa delgada larga, yo pedí la rosa y parecía usada ya! Mal producto!"
1.0,They don’t work. A waste of money.
1.0,"I REALLY love this dress and it looks amazing on me BUT (& this is my bad for missing the return window) I got sick after I purchased it so I wasn’t able to try it on until literally today (4/24/22). Upon trying the dress on I found a hole in it.<br />It’s in a terrible area so it isn’t like it’s an easy fix either. I don’t see me being able to use this at all now unless I can find a cute little patch to put in the spot and it will still be awkward to say the least. So it’ll still end up a Pjs probably due to having to patch it up.<br />REALLY wish I could return or exchange this bc again it’s a GREAT dress. Fits true to size & I should’ve ordered my normal size which is Small!<br />My measurements are 5’4”, 30” (bust) 25” (waist) 34” (hip) & I am a 2/4 in jeans depending on brand, Small/Medium in leggings depending on brand and level of compression.<br />I highly recommend this dress for the summer. It could be great to throw over your bathing suit! I can also see this as being a piece that could be dressed up with layers!<br />Just make sure you CHECK FOR HOLES when you get it so you don’t end up in my situation 😂<br />Take Care everyone!<br />I hope this helped bc reviews with measurements & honesty help me!"
1.0,Primero esta muy grande.no es de mi medida.Me toca llevarlo algun lugar para reducir el tamaño..Y mi esposo lo vio en otra tienda a menos precio.Y devolverlo es incomodo.
1.0,I did not get this sunglasses. Package was empty when received .
1.0,"Well I liked them up until they fell apart. The first time I wore the multi-colored set I brushed my hair behind my ear then heard my earring fall. I expected to just pick it up and put it back in but the hook came off and broke apart. Under further observation, I saw that one of the tassels has fallen off at some point today, too. I’ve only had these in for about 3 hours and I’ve done nothing but sit on Google Meet here in quarantine - it’s not like I went hiking in them. So sad! The multi-colored was my favorite set!"
1.0,"The packaging was excessive. There was a huge elongated box, about twice the length of the plastic poster. It is NOT canvas. It is thin textured plastic made to appear as plastic. Would've been better off printing out on my computer.<br />Not at all happy with the deceptive marketing.<br />Returning."
1.0,"Update :  lowered to 1 star. The fabric has that weird smell. It won't wash out. I've smelled it in cheap clothes before I'm not sure if it's international fabric or dye but it STINKS. Threw this shirt away today.<br /><br />I was hoping this would work. I'm a 38C, I wear size 12 so I got a large but it's way to big. It looks very frumpy and you can see my bra under my pits because the arm holes are too big. Lesson learned for me. I don't need to buy clothes on line!  Also, the slits on the sides are longer than I expected."
1.0,Poor quality.  Not as advertised.
1.0,Felt like I was wrapping myself with an Ace Bandage. I wrapped myself. Then my Hubby wrapped me. And I looked nothing like the picture and didn't feel comfortable. Adding a wrap 101 video might of been helpful.
1.0,Way too small. I ordered larger than my normal size and it's too tight.
1.0,Wont last long.
1.0,Shirt came with a broken zipper. It appeared to be a repackaged shirt. Have returned 2 items now. Sizes are inaccurate.
1.0,NOT STERLING SILVER. TURNS FINGERS GREEN
1.0,"The product I received looked used, some of the red paint was gone with very visible scratches. I’m very disappointed..."
1.0,material shrunk by 40% after washing and was unable to wear. seller did not refund me after I mailed dress back to them with proof of tracking number
1.0,Not TTS
1.0,This watch is NOT waterproof and I can not be returned. Very Upset
1.0,Only one side is carved and the edges are rough. They look so cheap I can’t even wear them
1.0,The toe of the boot has peeled. I will not buy again. My daughter really likes them but can not wear to school anymore.
1.0,"I am so displeased with how these earrings look. They do not look anywhere near as nice as the picture! The silver in the picture is bright like Bali silver should be, and the gold accents are very visible. I do realize this picture has been enlarged, and probably lightened to show the detail, but this is extremely misleading.  The actual earrings are dark grey (almost black) and you would have to have a magnifying glass to catch the gold details. As an owner of a large amount of Bali silver, and even faux Bali, I was tickled to find this set at a mere $15. You truly get what you pay for.<br /><br />UPDATE: I was issued a prompt refund upon returning this item."
1.0,Cute but didn’t hold up to normal light wear
1.0,The size is not accurate! Way too big
1.0,"Sent the wrong watch. I also bought a silver one a month ago and that is what i got again. So i gave to nephew for his birthday he loved it, but i still have to give it 1 star for the mix up."
1.0,Ordered for my wife and she did not like the pattern on the sandle. Whoops!  she said it looked good on-line but did not like it in person.
1.0,This dress fits really Strange on me. It's doesn't looks flattering on large chested women. With my large chest... It made the dress lift out(flow out). Making me look pregnant. Also where the pockets land on me makes me look FAT. But the material feels so  soft. It's FREE dropping it off at the UPS Store. In my case I don't have the time dropping it off for a REFUND. I wished it was FREE of them just picking it up at my resistance. So I'm very disappointed 😾
1.0,Color is off. I ordered the black and brown chevron print and it was clearly black and almost a rose color. I would not say it was brown at all.
1.0,I was so disappointed about this product I needed it real bad for a birthday party
1.0,Very off on the sizing
1.0,Is not good quality! I only use once it already turn bad !!!
1.0,The dress doesn’t look anything like the photos. Not flattering- at least on my body
1.0,Earrings came broken into pieces. Not worth the hassle to return. They could’ve been beautiful. They’re just poorly made apparently.
1.0,Unevenly stitched. Poorly made and glued.
1.0,Ordered the correct size but this was at least two sizes smaller
1.0,I am a medium/large. Size 8. 140. I ordered other styles from the same brand in medium at the SAME time and they fit great. This particular style was like a saggy bag. I'm not trying to do a sack race. Baggy all the way through. Not just the &#34;bat wing&#34; design. SORELY disappointed.
1.0,Inside of the wallet is Not green !!!!!!!!!!
1.0,"3 days after I got this, the gold wore off! Now all  have is a stainless steal  ring that tarnishes  my finger.  Not what  expected at all."
1.0,"I am extremely disappointed in my purchase, into thinking they would be made of real titanium then two days later find out they're the most flimsy glasses I have ever wore! On the same day I requested a refund and drop them off at the local UPS store and got a refund on the same day"
1.0,"I never considered myself to have sensitive or easily irritated skin, but after a couple months of wearing these bands, I noticed my skin getting red, itchy, & peeling where the band clips together. Im thinking the material is just really cheap. It could just be me. Something to consider."
1.0,"The size is not correct, the fabric cheap and it fits awfully. I won't recommend it to anybody."
1.0,lenses weren't great if you've ever worn anything substantial/quality.<br />wood finish seemed cheap. would suggest paying more to one of the better wood sunglass brands.<br />these aren't worth the effort.<br /><br />returned after 2 weeks when they started to crack and metal hardware started failing.
1.0,This shirt is not what is described I do believe it is not made of the material in the description  The logo was not the same and the nuggets logo on the shirt was offcentered. Not worth the money.
1.0,Not flattering at all. Sent back
1.0,Tiny tiny tiny ..... great for a child but pics are misleading. Could barely get them closed on my adult ears.
1.0,"Visually speaking this is a brilliantly designed watch. It looks heavy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />Then you pick it up.<br /><br />Instead of quality, heavy metal and a nice, thick leather band you're greeted with a flimsy & cheap contraption that you wouldn't pay $20 let alone $100+ for at the mall - applies to both the watch face & band.<br /><br />Shipped back ASAP."
1.0,"So these are thin, not what is pictured or described at all. Cheaply made worse then 5 dollar Walmart leggings"
1.0,Nothing like the picture so I exchanged it and I still got nothing like the picture not even close
1.0,"I just put these on today was my first day wearing them. I bought them a few weeks ago. I was waiting for a perfect day to wear them decided to wear them today and as soon as I put them on, I started walking they started tearing poor quality, I’m very disappointed in this, I wasted money for nothing. I expect something to be done about this."
1.0,We purchased this item and it was worn two times when the zipper sewing started coming apart. We requested a return for the poor quality and was issue only 50% when it was a quality issue. Do not buy these items as it is junk and this com-any is a ripoff
1.0,It broke in two months
1.0,"The design of the bracelet is very nice but unfortunately the cz stones used in the center of the snowflake design were very cloudy compared to the rest of the bracelet and in my opinion totally ruined the effect, would not recommend."
1.0,"The material feels inferior, thin and slightly rough/scratchy? The sleeves are way too long.<br />The collar is too stiff and feels like cardboard! Would not by again!"
1.0,3 weeks in and they already have holes. Don’t waste your money. NG
1.0,This is not a regular fit Jeans. My husband wears size 32 so naturally he ordered a size 32. It was small and very short. This pants length is 28.5 inches long. In the picture you can see I placed this Jeans on top of another slim fit size 32 Jeans purchased here on Amazon a well. You can clearly see the difference. My husband end up giving the pant away total waste of money. Very disappointed.
1.0,The material was cheap almost like bathing suit material. Returned it.
1.0,Does not look nothing like described. The material is very cheap and the size was way smaller than expected. Extremely disappointed with this item. It was a waste of money since I had to throw it away. Was not even worth given it away or as a gift.
1.0,This product looks very nice and I liked it until I put it on. I also notice some embedded images in the dress as well. I would show a picture but I could not put my arm in it.
1.0,Feathers were missing did not look like the picture I was very disappointed
1.0,Design and fabric not flattering to the body.
1.0,"I had high expectations for this dress. To my great disappointment, the dress did not come from the advertised company nor was it as the description said it would be. I'm just above 5'4, I wear a size 40D-40DD bra and I'm between a 16/18 in clothing.I ordered an XXL just to be safe. It did not sit well on me, and the seam that separates the bust and the waist did not even clear my boobs. It did not have cap sleeves, as you can see in the picture provided, and the material was that of a cheap, stretchy, thin costume design. I read previous comments about this dress and most women said it was a great product. I have had many previous disappointments with other clothing orders online, but I decided to give it another try. So far I still disapprove of it. Hopefully, I can find a product that will change my mind soon enough."
1.0,"This shirt could fit my small terrier dog, not realistic at all. I order a large thinking it would run small and it was a child small. Not happy about the product and it was cheaply made."
1.0,"Did not even last through opening package, got today in mail and seem ripped when just trying to open bag, do not trust using for grocerys if seems fall apart just from opening bag up.  Spend more and get well made product."
1.0,Loved this ring for my septum..... but a stone fell out and I literally had only worn it for two days!  Two days. Oh well
1.0,"The best part about this dress is that it arrived on time and the length this perfect.  I'm usually a small to medium.  I'm 5'1&#34; and a half I have a 34 C cup, a 28-inch waist, & 41-inch hip.  I ordered the small.  The zipper is hard to zip up and down hopefully it will hold up.  The top is very awkward it fits more like a large.  Someone could easily reach in to my dress through the arm holes across my chest fitting easily that's how much extra there is&#60;-- We did it.  Overall the dress &#34;appears&#34; to be pretty.  The dress is very thin poor quality material.  It's see-through sheer looking floral fabric.  The underlining shows every hym through this fabric because instead of sewing it on the inside of the dress they sewed it between the two layers. Hopefully no one will notice for the wedding and I will never wear it again!  I will have to alter the top to be able to wear it for the wedding as well as for one of the other Bridesmaids.  I would have sent it back but we have two weeks.  This dress fits the colors for the wedding and is the only one we've been able to find prime eligible that can fit all three girls who are all entirely different shapes."
1.0,"Runs way too small and quality is bad. They look very cheap, not like on picture. Returning it"
1.0,"I like the concept behind ghe charm. It’s turning some too, but the main thing is the purple center piece with the awareness symbol, peeled right out of the charm pieces at a time!"
1.0,"I hate to leave negative reviews but this wasn’t for me. It’s shiny, had a strong odor from the dye or fabric and just felt funny material wise. Looks great in the photo but just not for me"
1.0,I didn’t like the style of the dress
1.0,When this arrived it fit more like a girl's dress than a woman's. It sort of fit but was the wrong shape for anyone with any shape.
1.0,Too small tarnishes everyday
1.0,Pretty bummed to see them arrive already coming apart before they’ve ever been worn. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Not long enough at all. Does not reach crotch. Teared while pulling them up the first time. Didn't get a chance to wear them. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Fabric used for this product is cheap. When working out the waistband tends to keep rolling down. Not sturdy at all. Especially for people with curves not recommended.
1.0,These run extremely small. Had to return and the material is kind of weird not as stretchy as most compression shirts.
1.0,"This item is complete crap. You can't even change the time. The item does not come with proper instructions on how to set time, month, day or even year. About the only thing it will do is count down from 45 minutes only.. and the. You can add minutes for stoppage time. But you can't count down from 40, 35, 30, etc."
1.0,I really liked these but they started to crack after only wearing them three times.  By the forth time the left one split in half like tin foil.
1.0,Too fitted at top to feel comfortable in.
1.0,Purchased this as a travel charger for my Q Venture.  It does not magnetically connect as the one that came with it does.  It will not charge my watch.  I would send it back but I threw the package away before testing it.
1.0,to much
1.0,I bought the berry band. The plastic parts that go in to the watch and the plastic tab at the end of the band is an ugly pink almost orange and doesnt even match the band like the other pics Ive seen in the reviews!!  Terrible!! I wouldve never bought it if Id known it was going to clash so bad!!  Thinking about returning it!!
1.0,"I am 5’6, 135lbs. I ordered a size small and the shorts were SUPER baggy (I expected them to be somewhat, but not this much!)  around the legs but really tight around the waste. The material looks and feels like a pair of scrubs that were cut and hemmed. The front part of the “skirt” is only held together with the tie belt and slips out of it as soon as you move around. And last but not least the shirt is not the one from the picture.. it’s a totally different style, cheap tank top that  is basically see through and very baggy for a size small!"
1.0,"Just like the pic and true to size. I have thick calves ( 17 in.) and they fit great.<br />*Update*<br />Within 30 minutes of wearing, they cracked and started to peel. Only one boot was defective. The other seemed fine. I returned them and the seller was prompt to issue the refund. Really sad about it because I really did like the boots."
1.0,Its cute but made with such cheap metal. Feels like children plastic metal. The price should reflect the Quality I would pay 4.99or less
1.0,This change tray does not fit any change pad. The smallest size change pad I can find is 16” which is still too big to fit the opening of the change tray. Very disappointing.
1.0,midiendosela la clienta se abrio en la manga
1.0,"I’ve order these and a pair for 1$, exactly the same"
1.0,material does not protect your clothing from hair dye.
1.0,Ordered a size up as suggested. I'm 5'3. 112lbs. Medium bottoms were still too small. Material wasn't bad though. Returned it.
1.0,"the scratchy plastic-like ""fabric"" is not comfortable in the least. this feels like it has ZERO percent cotton, and made of strips of crunchy abrasive plastic."
1.0,Received women’s.
1.0,"Very pretty watch, while it worked.....it stopped and no matter what i do it won't work again. Seller did not answer for the warranty."
1.0,The butterfly decal on the shirt is more on the stomach it is too low. The fit is perfect the decal is just misplaced.
1.0,Watch looks really fake and cheap don’t waste your time. Also they kept sending me more and taking money off my credit card I don’t know how.
1.0,What I received looks nothing like the picture.it was a gift that I'm now stuck with.won't buy from this vender again
1.0,This is not the right one. It was supposed to have epilepsy on it not awareness saves lives.
1.0,I'm not real happy with the product I bought it for my daughter for Christmas so we'll see how she likes it but it is a lot smaller than it appeared to be
1.0,"AWFUL!!!!! I took them out of the package, didn’t even try them on.... I could see right through them!!!!! Actually held them up and could see through the back AND front together! They also feel Horrible"
1.0,Very small for the top...
1.0,Nothing special to speak of
1.0,they all arrived with dead batteries
1.0,They do not cover the basll of your foot like pictured
1.0,They just don't work well.
1.0,"I wasn't able to get these over my knees, much less keep them there. I have average to large calfs, but I'm certainly not big enough to need extra wide calf boots and there's even much room around the tops of my boots that I where.  I was very disappointed in the lack of stretch.  They seem to be made for a junior, not a woman."
1.0,I did read that it is an assortment... which means you random emoji faces.  I was disappointed to see that I got all sad face or crying emoji faces.  These are for my 5 year old and I don't think she will want to wear the sad face earrings. Just disappointed with the selection I received.
1.0,Too small and made with cheap fabric.
1.0,"First one DOA. This one is fine. Great Amazon support. Attactive, resembles Rolex for some reason 😉. Use GMT 24 hr hand for radio comms work. Most messages in Army and ham radio are in GMT time to avoid local time zone confusion. Do not swim with it, wash hands, shower OK. Rotating bezel solid feel. Good value"
1.0,Veryyy short and not like the picture
1.0,"I ordered a 2x - which is usually large on me, but I need it for my chest.  It was a &#34;real world&#34; large.  Beware."
1.0,"Did not fit at all as expected. Looked more like a children’s size. So disappointed because it was so cute in the pic. Also, a hassle to return. They wanted me to pay shipping."
1.0,Did not fit too large at the hips
1.0,Do not buy if your big boned. Bought twice cause it said runs small. 1st I bought extra large. Did not fit Bought 4x they still. Think the pants should be kid sizes.
1.0,Not what was represented
1.0,It came with no top. And was the last in stock. Very disappointed.
1.0,"This product is horrible. Very nice to the eye but complete trash. I had bought one sliver a year ago it lasted me 10 months very well before it started ripping at the seems at the bottom and everything fell out of the main pocket. I trusted this company a second time, purchased another pack same one same company... I got it December 2019 in feburary 2020 the whole middle pocket tore little by little until it was completely ripped in half and all my stuff inside fell out again. Do not buy. I would like a refund or another pack just to lay around the house something for compensation give it to a kid for school. Durability of this pack is not a strong suit, it falls apart."
1.0,This is a scam received an empty envelope do not order!
1.0,[...] support peterbilt by buying from them yes them they have a place with a lot of cool items on it for instance I think on there this cap as $16
1.0,Product was not well made and charged 10$ for shipping and now the seller ONLY does refunds if I PAY FOR SHIPPING AGAIN so basically I pay the entire price of the dress<br />DONT BUY FROM THIS SHOP
1.0,"When it comes to using them for wedges that are just a hair too big, these do not work AT all. You're better off trying something else. For shoes that need some comfort in the heel area, they might work, but that's not what I bought them for."
1.0,My boy has wide fit these could not fit. its cute and looks very comfortable. it just did not work for my baby
1.0,Most of these are smashed and crooked. But they are all adorAble.
1.0,I was really excited for this dress for my daughter who loves cats. I bought it for her birthday party dress. She put it on and within minutes the stitching on the seam under her arm was starting to rip. Her party hadn’t even started yet. I figured I’d fix it later because it was just a small thing. Half way through her party she came to me in tears because the skirt had completely ripped all the way around. This dress was very poorly made! DO NOT BUY.
1.0,"Belts work ok, not good quality. Also, ordered the 3-pack belts. 2 showed up. Amazon customer service took care of issue with gift card."
1.0,though I was going to get a great deal  but nope these are tiny - not good quality fabic not are the colors true  -  not much good to say
1.0,"I bought this on my husbands account so I have to leave the review here. Too much $ for a terrible dress.<br /><br />This ""dress"" is made of material that looks and FEELS like an oiled tarp. I cannot believe it's the same dress as the pictures. I wouldn't let my cat sleep on this . It's always a crap shoot if things will be ok from Amazon. I gambled and lost.<br /><br />Back it goes! I rarely return things ."
1.0,"This purse had everything I wanted.  It looks great.  The size is perfect and the various pockets and card slits are easily accessible.  Unfortunately the buckle on the shoulder strap makes it unwearable.  The buckle is too big and allows the strap and the prong to move to the buckle corner.  The prong can then fall through the buckle, unbuckling the strap and allowing the purse to fall to the floor.  This happens regularly.  Since it's obvious that the buckle is too big, I'm assuming that the one that doesn't fit the strap was a means to make the purse cheaper to make. Since I don't have the where-with-all to fix it, I have to go through the hassle of returning it.  I'm very disappointed that quality of an other wise terrific product wasn't the primary concern of the company."
1.0,"Not for me, was really small"
1.0,Firstly shipping is way too long. No real shipping information. Also it's poorly made. The measurements are wrong.  I'm 140lbs. This pos is garbage. Everything is wrong. The stitching sucks
1.0,these are terrible cheap plastic knock offs  i want my money back  made in TAIWAN
1.0,"very small, even taking reference table"
1.0,Very thin and see through. Made cheaply. It is not as long as shown in the photo. Disappointed in my purchase.
1.0,"Ordered a size 38, tried them on, waaaay too small. Measured the circumference, and they're 34;. Not worth returning, but buyers should be warned the fitment is totally off."
1.0,"Looked great online, ordered according to the sizing chart, but it's not even close to being the correct size.  It's easily 4 sizes too small.  Very disappointed because the color and fabric looked nice."
1.0,"The cups would be too small regardless, but they are also so full of foam padding that there is no place for my breasts to go.<br /><br />Additionally, it does not have enough structure or silicone grip to keep it in place, so it falls down almost immediately.<br /><br />It came with removable straps, which might be useful, even though I bought it specifically because I wanted a strapless bra. Unfortunately, there are loops to attach the straps in the front, but not in the back.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed."
1.0,Falsely advertised. This is not 6 masks it is only 4
1.0,"Such a disappointment!  Poorly made, could barely see the gears, etc. through the cloudy plastic."
1.0,"I had to returned , too small it’s very nice but I had to send it back and get  another size that will feet perfect"
1.0,These are very poorly made. One of the bracelets was broken when I opened it. Not a good buy at all.
1.0,This watch is so cheap I am so upset I wasted my money. The button to change the day doesn’t work! I can’t change the day and the piece that hold the band is broken. I can’t even wear it.
1.0,Great for standing all day. If you’re constantly bending over or getting up and down out of a chair does not hold up.
1.0,To small around the ankles
1.0,"I returned because the fit was not flattering. If you are chesty it will likely fit like a long baby doll dress, which in my case means it made me look pregnant. With less of a chest I think the waist would sit lower and look better"
1.0,I sent it back because it was way too small.
1.0,"This shirt, is supposed to be a tunic, and it is not"
1.0,no good had to return and the seller did not give me back a full refund not happy
1.0,Horrid and cheap.
1.0,"These earrings do not have the design on the back of the earrings, which is a bummer."
1.0,This set is made well and keeps my grandson warm.  It is cuter then the picture.  He is into dinosaurs so he loves the design on the hat.  I liked working with this seller because it was a no problem transaction.<br />M. Allen
1.0,It's a Christmas present so don't know yet
1.0,The directions were not in english.  The item does not work.  Waste of time and MONEY
1.0,"Quality is poor and the hood is so large it fits an adult head. The neck material is also so bulky it's too much material around an adult neck, much less a baby! Returning this thing."
1.0,The handle broke 5 days after using it.
1.0,"Greatly disappointed in this hat, a  misshapen mess, hat fits extremely poorly. Don't waste you hard earned money."
1.0,"I wouldn't say This looks nothing like the picture, but not really close. The grey is solid, not a heather grey stripe like the picture. The yellow is a canary yellow, not a muted yellow, like the picture. There is a yellow stripe around the collar, not the solid grey like the picture. And the colors/patterns don't line up on the front. Looks ridiculous."
1.0,"It fell apart fast, very cheap."
1.0,No me gusto.
1.0,Very disappointed extremely small. Don't understand why they would make something this small. I'm not a very big girl but still average people can't fit in this.
1.0,"Got a large, normally a med size (6-8) but saw the elastic... Boy it that elastic tight!"
1.0,Poor quality. Skirt is very very thin & see-through. I returned it.
1.0,Horrible timepiece. Stopped running after 5 hours on my wrist first time wearing. Do Not Purchase.
1.0,"These look great, and have the mirrored look that is popular now, but they fell apart after 1 week in use. I own a number of sunglasses from Oakley to Ray-Ban, and a couple cheap brand like H&M and some from Amazon. I can tell you that I take good care of all my sunglasses. Never have I had an issue unless they fell on the ground or I did something. These glasses on the other hand, fell apart literally while I was wearing them. Complete junk. Stay away."
1.0,"I got this for my dad. He said after he wore it for a few hours, his eyes started hurting."
1.0,To small itchy
1.0,"I don't feel like these wash up well. The pockets become bulky and it looks cheap.<br /><br />Also, when they arrived they were missing 3 pocket buttons and the front fly button. When I communicated with Wantdo I was told to contact Amazon. I did. Twice.  But Amazon refused to send me a refund or do an even exchange for the sale price is first purchased it at."
1.0,"Use this product for the first time last week while on vacation, the zipper broke and the inside started  to come apart from the first night of using it.."
1.0,The strap is so big it would fit an elephants leg.the watch is pretty but I have to buy a new strap
1.0,Only turns 1 way.. should have sent back
1.0,"This ""dress"" is so freaking small!!! Fits my like a super tight cardigan and I'm not that big. Ridiculous!"
1.0,Did not fit in the arms and a size up would have been a tent….so if you have larger or muscular arms move on …too bad tho a cute dress otherwise
1.0,I'm is only partially lined in the front. So you end up seeing that the lining goes to just under the bust. If you get this and want to keep it you will need to remove the lining. It's truly awful.
1.0,String broke fist time I touched it.
1.0,Purse broke after 3 months the handle that connects to the purse completely came off and now the purse is garbage do not buy it is not worth it quality sucks
1.0,This thing broke within the first week of by boyfriend having it on his key ring. Would not reccomend! Was dissapointed because it was so cute.
1.0,Complete garbage. the surface of the item is not even smooth. Don't understand these people just trying to send trash to make money.
1.0,"The material feels good and is stretchy, but the sizing is so far off it's almost funny."
1.0,I really didn’t enjoy this set too much. I didn’t like the material or the way it fit.
1.0,I’m pretty short (5’2) this fit more like a crop top and barely fit my head. Weird cut. Returned.
1.0,"Chain came broken , i have to fixed by myself, arrived too late"
1.0,I bought this for a gift and now it has melted beyond repair. Which since this item isn't returnable I now do not have the money for.
1.0,Not for narural big beast women
1.0,Very poor quality and waste of my money. It looks beautiful on the picture but in really it is a piece of garbage. It started to come apart while I was putting in on for the first time so I never got to wear it. I use it to clean my furniture.
1.0,There were literal crumbs on this dress. It had animal hair all over it and creases and stretching from wear. GROSS!!
1.0,Don’t work!
1.0,Product came with holes
1.0,I was disappointed with how this turned out based on other reviews. It’s super grainy and just not the quality I was expecting!
1.0,I was going to present this to my wife on Christmas so I paid 24 dollars for shipping...I got it 2 days ago and I am so disappointed that I will not be presenting this to my wife. The quality of this picture is absolutely terrible. You can tell it's a picture but there are a many markings throughout and the necklace would fit around a small child's neck. I'm so disappointed in this product...so much that I don't even want to contact the company and pay to return it or even deal with it. I'm going to throw it away and take my loss. If they allowed you to do half stars I'd do half of a star.
1.0,I love the way the glasses feel on my face and like the way they look. I have bought two orders of these glasses and all of them have broke near the nose piece and the lens fell out. That is four pair of glasses. They might have gotten me twice but there want be a third time. These readers might be very reasonable but your just throwing your money away with these readers.
1.0,"The picture shown makes scarf appear very pretty.  The scarf I received is cheap looking, had to double check the picture to make sure it was the right one.  It was.  It great for a child playing dress up, but much else.  You get what you pay for on this one."
1.0,I thought it was going to be better quality. So disappointed.  I gifted it anyway. I didnt have time to order anything else.
1.0,Huge disappointment. Sizing is misleading :(
1.0,"This product is nothing like pictured, I didn’t even get the pattern I ordered!! There are no ruffles at the bottom and it’s more like a cape than a skirt. The material is also very cheap feeling and looking!"
1.0,disappointment this piece just turns and is not a good investment not worth it.
1.0,Button missing upon opening. Looks like a blanket w buttons
1.0,This is the OLDER style of the bag.  It has since been updated with an adjustable strap and a magnet closing.  I returned it because I wanted those new features.
1.0,"GARBAGE, BASURA, Chinese crap !!! If they were $5 for the pair it would be worth. Do your self a favor and go to the gas station and get a superior pair or sunglasses LOL . The lenses are super thin and loose in the frames."
1.0,snaps tore out after third time wearing.material at crotch is very thin.garbage
1.0,"I ordered the biggest size and, it was too small to wear. At least I could recycle the ring...the spikes cant be removed."
1.0,good for costumes for one night NOT for formal dress evening balls or events. You get what you pay for.
1.0,SO MAD. Ordered a size bigger and it was STILL TOO SMALL. PISSED.
1.0,"I really loved them, and then I took them in the pool. The polarization is all worn off now. Terrible that a sunglasses lens company wouldn’t think people would go in the pool with the lenses."
1.0,This product is not the same quality that it use to be. I bought the same shirts a year ago and they were amazing. The new shirts I ordered are made of an inferior thin material. Probably the manufacturer trying to save money at the expense of the product quality. This is very unfortunate. I use to like these shirts.
1.0,It was way too difficult to get open.  Save yourself and buy something easier to open
1.0,"I bought a large when I usually wear a medium to large. It was really tight, super scratchy, and really short! Going back."
1.0,This dress runs big and is strange in the chest area. It hangs and has big pads in it. Would not but again!!
1.0,Arrived with 2 holes. NOT seen properly.<br />Runs very small in size.<br />Cheaply made.<br />Contacted seller about problems and got no response.
1.0,I bought these in January and after a couple of weeks they started falling apart the same as another reviewer.  They were great at first but are poor quality.  Wouldn't recommend these for every day wear.
1.0,Doesn't fit as expected. Leg openings are to small.
1.0,It is adorable but didn't withstand ore than a week of use.  It fell off a few days after securing it.
1.0,"This is the cheapest shirt ever, like not just the quality of the heat press ( it’s not a screen print) but the quality of the actual shirt  it’s shiny and cheap ... I bought another hocus pocus shirt at the same time because I’m basic Af and this one is def getting returned because it’s  so cheap looking .  Also  runs big"
1.0,Very bad quality break after one day of use
1.0,Poor quality a let down from my other purchase my old purchase was made much better and last longer. thanks
1.0,A waste of money looks nice but the color change from the first day
1.0,Too difficult to open and close. My son cannot do it himself without pinching his fingers. I returned them.
1.0,Do not buy them. They broke within a week of using them.
1.0,terrible fit very baggy
1.0,Extremely big
1.0,Directions confusing
1.0,Cheap cheap material. Wanted to return but have to pay for shipping. Thought prime took care of that
1.0,Not the quality of band for my watch I believed was pictured. It’s ok but the cheap<br />Silicone itches my skin.
1.0,"Doesn't look like the ad! Ears don't stick out through the hair and the mask is actually blue!! CHEAPLY made, too! WORSE than all that it says I can't return it!  This sucks for $13.....don't buy it"
1.0,The wig in the picture fits over the man's head and the sides of his head.  The wig I received just fit at the top of my head.  It did not hide the elastic band that held the beard.  I was very disappointed.  The beard was nice.
1.0,Dont trust this website its bad material. I bought some boots here to give to a friend in my home country only to be embarrassed a few weeks later after she told me that the boits I gave her were peeling and coming undone. Save face and buy elsewhere.
1.0,These Sox’s did not fit at all!!! I was very disappointed in size they claim to be. To Small!
1.0,"A waste of money , got it for my daughters 7th birthday because she wanted a smart watch like mommy she’s worn it for all of an hour ! The watch won’t stay charged . The pictures are extra dark . Cute idea but crappy product overall"
1.0,Not worth the spend
1.0,That are too small all the way around especially after was in colb water and air drying
1.0,"This needs zero stars. First of all its not what is in the photo, second I wore it once and dropped it on my kitchen floor and it broke. Thirdly, it claims returnable. YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS RUBBISH. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK.!!!!"
1.0,This is total crap. Extremely cheap!! Never buy this. Looks nothing like the pic. You have to have a cone head in order to wear this.
1.0,"The shirt I received was not what I expected, and the graphic was completely off. The name was half missing as well as the word garage. While I was happy with the material of the shirt, the design is blurred and just not what was shown when I designed the shirt. Shipping was a nightmare, took way longer than I kept being told it would and the tracking didn't help because it left and arrived at so many facilities that were not identified. Included pictures of what I received and the design I ordered."
1.0,I do not know how to get it to fit my wrist. Hate it.  Took well. Over a month to receive. Never again will I buy from China😩😩😩
1.0,This dress runs so small. I ordered it for a wedding as I was a bridesmaid and it took forever to come in and then it ran so small we had to cut holes in it to try and make it a corset dress. Dress was also very see through
1.0,"Got silver, 60x47. Not polarized (checked by seeing computer monitors through this). So I got a replacement. Not polarized again, or too weak for actual usage. There must be critical issues in the production (or possibly strage) of this item."
1.0,"so much for full figured! The description is ridiculous. I am a small, athletic woman but with a large bust and this sports bra would barely fit a B cup and the band is ridiculously small, I am a 32 in most bras but this 34 barely made it around my back! In sports bras I have learned you get what you pay for but at least get the sizes listed correctly!"
1.0,Horrible ! I I was mortified when dress seams came apart first tine I wore it! Can’t be sewed back together so in the Gargage it goes. Sad because it was so cute
1.0,"Looked super cute on the photos, this was SUPER cheap quality, def not worth $27.98!!!!! Clearly made in china from cheap fabric. You can find better bang for your buck"
1.0,Super cute and comfy but after wearing for only one day they started tearing and left big holes up along waist Seam :( ordered more before this happened so hoping next two pairs don't do that or will be very disappointed
1.0,These socks are awful. They are both too small and too short. I didn't realize it but I can't even return them.
1.0,No especifican bien las tallas
1.0,Came with a nice case but glasses a Very cheap!!!
1.0,rusted in less than a week. not rose gold anymore. now somewhat of a brown nasty color. really disappointed
1.0,"The clips that attach it to my watch are defective. One side won’t stay on and the other side I can’t seem to take off. Have only had it for a few months, and really don’t like it."
1.0,Just wouldn't stay securely closed almost lost it more than three times
1.0,Sizes do not fit as expected. Will not work for me.
1.0,Glasses are cheap and probably what you would expect for the money but I specifically ordered this set because in addition to the smoked pair for day riding it shows a clear pair for night riding. I did not receive a clear pair at all.
1.0,"I really liked the look and fit of this band. The issue was the grey color faded and the white under it started to show. It looked really terrible and every day got worse. Had to buy a new band and wouldn't recommend this one as it stands right now, unfortunately."
1.0,Shorts came with a hole in them. Too much trouble to return.
1.0,Color faded and very noisy walking on floor.
1.0,"Not even close to fitting my Swarovski Crystal Activity Tracker, a total rip-off...I should have know....Made in China ;-("
1.0,not the same at all as what I ordered. very thin material not double lined and the wrong color
1.0,The material is good but they run a little big to size which is good in some cases but not in mine. I ordered two one for my grandson 18-24 months and it’s huge. The other one is a 5-6 yrs and it’s ok but it came with a yellow stain in the back of the shirt and and not happy with that considering the price of of it.
1.0,Chinese garbage.
1.0,Too much money for the product
1.0,"THE YAYS<br />Looked gorgeous upon arrival, definitely unique<br />THE NAYS<br />Somewhat uncomfortable, CORRODES quickly<br /><br />I had forgotten I purchased this but upon finding it in my jewelry drawer, I knew there was NO way it looked so gold originally.  I know it's hard to identify in a photograph but the entire ear cuff corroded like no other, without ever being warn.  Shameful selling."
1.0,Thx!
1.0,Lenses weren't polarized at all very disappointing. Also scratched incredibly easy with minimum use
1.0,Cheap band broke within 2 weeks of use!!
1.0,"The title says 2pc. I received one. It took a little more than 4 weeks to arrive.<br />additionally, I am a size 7 1/2 US womens shoe. I cannot wear it. The string is not long enough to reach my toe/ankle.<br />cheap, falsely advertised, and tiny."
1.0,I didn’t not like the sequence. The material sticks to your body. It doesn’t look bad on but  the sequence made some areas look bad.
1.0,The black band broke right away!!!
1.0,Wasnt the right fit for my body type being 5'8 180 lbs.
1.0,Went according to the size chart and still was waaaaay to small. Not impressed.
1.0,I wish I could give negative feedback this arrived damaged it was water inside the bag and the design was very poor and quality was bad too. The customer service is very bad too. Not recommended
1.0,Very thin. Almost see through and sizing was wrong.very small.
1.0,The fabric is not stiff and not tight. When I breathe the fabric gets sucked in and out. Hard to breathe in. Maybe have to buy one of those plastics to keep it away from my face.
1.0,It’s a polyester not a cotton as was advertised<br />I like bright color of this dress but quality and workmanship is poor!
1.0,Sized much smaller than expected. The 2XX fits like a small
1.0,"I don't know if it was supposed to come rooted, but it was.<br /><br />It worked really good for about 3 weeks. I have a Hisense Sero 7 Pro that compares favorably with the Nexus 7. This one wasn't far behind. Being pre-rooted was a good thing since I'd already looked into rooting instructions anyway.<br /><br />Then one day it was acting strange. I shut it down, and that was that. The end. It turns on, gets a boot screen and keeps acting like it's loading. I tried loading other ROMs. I found original ROMs and tried to load those. Nothing worked. I haven't given up completely. My hopes have nearly given up, though.<br /><br />I didn't bother trying to contact the vendor since I'd already read others' experience on that score. Usually I'm luckier than most, though, so I figured I'd have a better experience. This wasn't one of my lucky times.<br /><br />I only wanted the tablet for the joke factor in the name. Turns out the joke was on me."
1.0,"Soo all I've been seeing is these ads and promos on this ""new"" wrap band.  I purchased this and at first look it seems to be more than enough to comfortably wrap...however either I'm  doing it wrong (which I watched several diff vids of people double my size) or this thing is a POC!  About the 2nd wrap it starts to fold over, separate, and then it pushes all my lil fat up and it creates handlebars just under my bra area in the back....IVE NEVER HAD HANDLEBARS🤦‍♀️.  I can barely move.  I also notice that when I focus on my ""problem area (fupa) then it's not enough to wrap all the way up to meet with my bra  and then the bottom begins to roll up.  I have tried several times w this thing.  Now I can see that if I were to get it wrapped properly that I would be SNATCHED, but I can't get it to wrap according to how it is to be.<br />I am 5""11 and my waist is approx 36"" and my ""fupa"" area is approx 39""  so idk...and I have a long torso (not super long, but longer than most)"
1.0,Bought these for Santa glasses since the description specifically said for Santa and Mrs. Claus.  This is definitely a child size pair of glasses. The nose piece was so bent it would not have sat on my nose if they did fit.  VERRRRRY disappointed in the mis-advertising of this product.  Beware....if you need to return them for false advertising YOU PAY the shipping back.  Would not recommend this seller to anyone.
1.0,"Function on & off , sometimes no signal at all !<br />Would not refer to my friends as really low quality !"
1.0,I don't even know where to start.  These earrings are cheap in quality both in material and workmanship.  Pure garbage.  I ordered blue and they look more like purple.  The diamond is ginormous to the point where it is so obviously fake it looks ghetto.  One of the posts barely catches so it's easy to lose an earring with ease.  Took forever for these to arrive.  Shipped from China so not worth sending back.  I'm just glad I'm not out of too much money.
1.0,"After less than 2 months the leather for the flip out part has split, the seam is still intact.  I have all pockets filled with one credit card so I did not stuff more items than this wallet was designed for.  My previous wallet lasted 3 years before I decided to upgrade but it is now in better shape than this Bison is."
1.0,"These bent very easily, totally useless"
1.0,Rubber pieces falling out after a few weeks of use.
1.0,"Returned.......hate Polyester made clothes, THIN, scratchy, SEE THROUGH. In the photo they look like a cotton blend, my fault for not reading full description"
1.0,EW. Stay away. This dress is so cheap- the material is itchy and borderline see thru- I am super skinny and the XS wouldnt fit a small child. I dont know how anyone could say this was anything but gross. I actully recoiled at the site of it. Please do yourself a favor and order anything else from anyone else- this took way to long to arrive and was such a HUGE disappointment.
1.0,I was so hungry these vra I spend so much money and everyone<br />Distroyed
1.0,The sizing is horrid.  A 2x was like a size 14.
1.0,Broke shortly after I bought it.
1.0,Bigger than expected. And definitely not for a walker
1.0,"I like that the shirt fits perfectly for my size.  I didn't like that The secondary color is not as the image describes.  Instead of it being grey and black, it was gray and white.  Very dissatisfied with the product!!!"
1.0,"While it looks nice, the necklace had seven rings not six!  I should have checked before I gave it as a gift but I ASSUMED it would arrive correctly.  I know it’s a great price and I love the box it came in but necklace looks cheap"
1.0,THese earrings are childrens. I can't get them on. terrible!!!
1.0,there really isn't any protection with this material. I wouldn't buy it as a mask to protect against COVID or Flu.
1.0,"Unfortunately, the ends (that are meant to slip over the tips of the temple pieces) are really tiny. They are sewn with just a narrow opening that cannot be modified. My daughter has several pairs of pretty standard glasses, and there was no way any of them could be made to fit. Too bad. It's strange -- not sure what the manufacturer was thinking."
1.0,Don’t waste your money. These are absolutely horrible. Turned my skin green/black within AN HOUR. these are garbage!
1.0,These stocks were so big they barely fit my husbands feet! I bought them for my mom. They are probably meant for a size 10-12 women’s foot.
1.0,Does not look as expected. It looks like someone threw up on your feet. I'm sorry but I wish I spent my money elsewhere...
1.0,Unwearable.  Stinks like potting soil.
1.0,Poor quality and poorly made. That is all.
1.0,Horrible I must have been waisted when I bought this
1.0,Feel very misled the product is fine however you show in your advertisement that you can get six pairs when in truth you're only getting one pair real crap move for that I give the douchebags one star
1.0,"Way too small, doesn't fit AT ALL."
1.0,"Well sorry friends, but if you are looking for a good review for these cute little ears and a tail...you will have to keep searching.<br />They came on time, however they were very cheaply made (which I am surprised by that quality being as they are from Disney). The fabric was ripping right out of the bag and they tail was quite flimsy!<br />I was going to use this as a Halloween costume for myself, but ended up giving them to my kids to play with."
1.0,Arrived broken. Not wearable. Waste of money!
1.0,So slipped
1.0,Kinda of disappointed.  I ordered don't disturb I am playing my game with the controller.  Instead got don't disturb I'm busy playing fortnight.  My son doesn't care for that game.  Just double check what they say.
1.0,These are not worth it
1.0,Cute jacket- zipper popped off second time I put it on - not fixable
1.0,Dress came quickly but it was not like the picture at all..cheaply made..would not recommend purchasing this dress.
1.0,Bought this for my wedding and had to throw it out. It was way too big.
1.0,"I ordered a large, I am a 38D bust size.  The large is enormous!  It's more like a 2X.  I have been in surgeries from tragic motorcycle accident and unable to even open my package until today.  Now I have missed the deadline to return it."
1.0,Not a quality sports bra.
1.0,The 5x I bought in hopes it would be loose was more like a 13/14 and thinner than anyone could wear out side
1.0,Did not fit comfortable for me.  I had to return the item.
1.0,"I bought it as a birthday gift in October, but I just opened it up for my daughter and there is a hole in it. Tags are still attached and everything. I am highly upset."
1.0,"Not sure who this is made for. Have 3 daughter's all with different builds and it did not fit any of them. Very disappointed, then was told it couldn't be returned."
1.0,The cloth is of low-quality cotton. Not worth the price.
1.0,"Color looks nothing like photo, more brown than tan, looks like grandma color"
1.0,low quality and runs small
1.0,The purse that arrived is a denim blue shade. Nowhere close to light purple. I don’t even see the blue color offered as an option.
1.0,Gross. These Express brand socks arrived without a label or a tag. Just two loose socks wrapped in tissue paper - no thanks on the used socks that I intended to give as a gift. 🤢
1.0,To small for a size large sheds a lot it was missing one of the gloves and a little Cotton ball on the shoe also the shoe size very small
1.0,I would recommend this watch to women or boys.  Little small for adult men
1.0,This shirt was lovely. But it could have fit my eight year old granddaughter. I returned it.
1.0,Strap kept coming loose and falling off. Had to buy a different one. Dont waste your money.
1.0,I can not aford to return this belt other wise i would. It is a nice belt but it is shorter then i expected. I thought it was suposed to be a xl but when i put it on it felt like a large.
1.0,"The picture is deceptive.  The person in the image must be a very small person, the strap she is wearing looks like its very wide, like a camera strap.  In reality, the product is only 2.5&#34; wide, its a very thin lanyard.  Also, this is not a &#34;Dual Shoulder Belt&#34;, this is only a neck strap, there are no shoulder belts in this product.<br /><br />I could have bought a conference/event lanyard and gotten about the same quality."
1.0,Small sized socks not true to size as advertised and quality is so so. Not a good buy
1.0,Received a completely different suit than what was pictured. Very poor quality.
1.0,So cheap the letters look horrable dose not look like the picture
1.0,Not the same as in the pic. It's more like a bronze than gold. Not happy with this purchase.
1.0,"Oversized, no shape."
1.0,Trashy
1.0,The necklace came tangled
1.0,the pins wont stay in.
1.0,"See photo for sock after two wearings. They are soft and stay up well without being too tight, but a hole after only two wearings isn't acceptable."
1.0,"Loved it, but after washing in cold water and hang drying once, it's shrunk to the point that it can't be worn in public -- way too revealing."
1.0,Gathering in front is lop sided and it looks awful. Quality control is very poor.
1.0,Ripped at the croch!!
1.0,"Very lightweight fabric. Not as it appears as listed. Wrinkles terribly. Cheaply made, super thin."
1.0,"Received the wrong color, ordered the solid black"
1.0,arrived smashed in a plastic bag
1.0,"I really liked this bracelet when I first saw it and thought the price was really good. After researching other websites for the same bracelets I realized how good this price really was.<br />The bracelet arrived very quickly and in a bubble wrapped manilla envelope. The first thing I noticed was that the color was not as ""bright"" as the picture shows in the photo example. I dd try it on and found that it was well made and sturdy. The only problem was that several of the beads were missing color, chipped and two were broken.<br />I returned the bracelet (which was easy as far as printing a return label etc.) and won't bother with ordering another one.<br />This is the first time I've been disappointed in a product I've ordered from Amamzon.com"
1.0,1 star is false since I can’t post Stevie’s without one...Size is way off.... XL is for starving people. My 16 year old daughter was skinny enough to wear it. It’s made for skinny people
1.0,I am having to return it won’t fit my raybans
1.0,"I have submitted a refund request...The plastic face shield in the picture makes it appear to be strong plastic, when, in fact, it is floppy like a thick sheet protector that will most likely have to be adjusted frequently due to flopping over. The fabric is a stretchy polyester knit not “moisture-wicking.” Definitely NOT what I expected, especially for the money spent. You do get several masks in nice designs but that is all. I will not use these."
1.0,"The stitching popped on the back the first time I wore it, and it was not tight."
1.0,The dress is not as described
1.0,Do not buy unless it's the only thing available. Wore for 1 1/2 months and broke. Will never buy again.
1.0,"These boots are indeed warm but don’t know how long that will last as they shed feathers like a wet dog sheds hair!<br />All ove the ottoman, on the bed, on the floor…thankful is does not smell like a wet dog as well!"
1.0,The balloons would have been perfect if 2 out of the 3 weren't defective. They had slow leaks and were deflated within 2 hours of being inflated. Very disappointed as was my daughter who's Birthday they were for.
1.0,The right leg one zipper is broken
1.0,The hat itself is not bad but the logo is just a stamp and they couldn't even get the lettering straight - very obvious.  I would not waste my money on Splash Bros. products.  I also ordered the same hat from Waldeal that was embroidered and the logo is nice and straight.
1.0,These look nothing like the description!  Beyond disappointed.
1.0,"False Advertising From What The Kid is Wearing In The Picture, The Whole Reason I Bought The Mask Was Because My Son Likes Darth Vader & The Advertising Shows So Much Detail But When You Actually Get The Mask Do Much Is Missing Besides Darth Vader Take A Good Look At The Mask I Got & The Mask The Kid Has In The Advertisement. I'm Just Really Disappointed. I Payed This Much Money For A False Advertisement, I'm Not Happy One Bit. Why Fool The Public To Make Us Think We Will Get All The Detail In The Mask To Fool People?"
1.0,"Stay Away, this are so badly made that they snag when you try to put them on. I hope Amazon don’t carry cheap China made junk or the brand Amazon will be known for selling junk."
1.0,"It's cute and relatively cheap but mine broke 5 mins out of the box. The material is some low grade plastic that can't and wont take much abuse. Simply put, this is just straight up cheap."
1.0,These pajamas were nowhere close to what the picture look like they were horrible do not buy buyer beware.
1.0,👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
1.0,Too many cloths coming from China that their sizes don’t match most people
1.0,"This is a total bait and switch. These are crappy knee-level (at best) shorts. The product I received was a completely different brand (see label on pocket). Also notice the pockets are zipper (not button) and the leg opening has no adjustable band. I’d love to share more, but the entire label is written in Chinese and I don’t read Chinese. The size was also all wrong.."
1.0,needed for warmth
1.0,Lava Beads are plastic. Not Real Lava beads. Black coating Chipping off. Only had the bracelet 24 hours.
1.0,"It’s a pretty skirt but yes, it does run small. Mine arrived with the strings not even attached to the skirt. Also the liner would be exposed if I could even wear it. It sticks out where the skirt crosses."
1.0,I bought this as a gift for my sister for Christmas.<br />It is junk. The finish was terribly bubbled and rough. I understand the pendent was inexpensive but the pendant looked and felt really really cheap.
1.0,Was not orange was gold very disappointed
1.0,"I loved the basic design, however the sizing was off. It was extremely too big for me. After reaching out to the seller. I found out that they do not do exchanges. I would probably never order anything from this seller again. I can understand if i just wanted to return it but not to exchange thats ridiculous to me. I would have to PAY to return the product and then reorder!! NO THANKS!!!"
1.0,"I bought these to wear at a show we were playing. They were supposed to be a surprise for my band mates, so i had only tried them on about twice before the show. As we were getting on stage, i went to put the glasses on, and the cheap pieces of crap snapped right where the hinge pin goes through. I've had a lot of cheap glasses that break way too early for the amount of money spent on them. These take the cake. In fact, I'm glad they asked for a review, because that reminds me that these are getting returned for a refund. I should go start that process. Don't buy these!"
1.0,These pants are not suitable for gym. The material is rough and the pants themselves are thin and see through. There’s no way people in the pictures modeling the pants are working out in them Because they are not comfortable at all.
1.0,"I am 5'5"" 265lbs. I typically wear a XL-XXL in most clothing. I bought a XXL pair of ripped denim shorts a couple of months ago and I absolutely love them! Finding these fringed ones were going to be a great addition to my wardrobe! I ordered them in a XXL like the other ones of a different brand. However, these do not fit at all! They are much smaller! You can see the size difference in the pictures I have posted, laying these shorts over my other pair. I'm truly disappointed."
1.0,It's too big....<br />I never ordered a (Large)<br />I ordered a small....<br />It's &quot;Un-wearable &quot;
1.0,"This is so cheap. Material is cheap, it runs sooo small, company runs under several names by the time you receive item from China item doesn’t exist anymore but yet you find exact same item with same pics under different name. Returns are impossible with them saying you have to pay shipping which goes against Amazons A-to-Z Guarantee. Just stay away & save yourself the money & headache."
1.0,This items is of poor quality is not recommended and not silver
1.0,Shirt was way too small and refund took forever. This product ships from China.
1.0,Not even close to the description as advertised.  You'll have to wait a month to get it as well. Smells like gasoline. Don't know how to return.
1.0,This is a shirt that comes from China and is awful quality. The print is blurry and choppy. Do not waste your money. So disappointing.
1.0,"Great price, but I haven't even worn it yet and probably never will. It just looked cheap when I received it."
1.0,"Great glasses but - 4 stars for doubling in price in less than a week, as I was about to purchase more. No way now."
1.0,Doesn’t look like the picture and the sizing is all wrong. Don’t order this!
1.0,They seem comfortable but they did begin fraying after one day of my toddler wearing them.
1.0,El artículo nunca llegó.
1.0,"I don't use this strap very often.  Broken ""leather"" after maybe 50 uses.  I am fortunate that I saw the leather was broken before I damaged my instrument.  I don't like posting negative reviews, but this is poor quality.  Its also pretty bulky - which made it difficult to attach to the neck."
1.0,doesn’t stay in place
1.0,I gave this dress away
1.0,"This dress was VERY CHEAPLY made!  Material very thin and the tassels at the bottom were all messed up!  Some sewn together, some of them hung crooked.  Very disappointed!"
1.0,"Did arrive on time. However, it wasn't fully assembled. The latch for the was replaced a piece of rice. It really made me sad because the gift was for a friend."
1.0,"My bracelet broke after the first wear. I am so disappointed in the quality. It arrived late and took several weeks to arrive. I wore it one day to work, looking forward to supporting a good cause and it broke. The smaller string that allows for movement of the main bracelet itself just came unraveled almost immediately. I am so disappointed and wish this company would replace my bracelet since I have financially supported their cause."
1.0,"If I could give this zero stars I would! It was entirely too big AND IT SMELLED HORRIBLE! This bodysuit had a hole in the crotch and reeked of musk. As if someone went out in it the night before, participated in every dance contest on the strip then came in the next day took it off and threw it in a envelope addressed to me. I needed this outfit for a trip and it almost didn't even make it in time. I sent this crap right back the very next day"
1.0,These don’t look anything like the picture. I will be returning them. I hate the white part. The picture is all purple. No white.
1.0,I was very excited to receive these earrings today after my packages were delayed 🙃 for 2 days after the promised but to my surprise my husband pointed out they turned my ears green they looked completely tarnished and destroyed absolutely awful and ofcourse its when I can't return then as it happened a day after I could return smh I should have known but I've bought a bangle bracelet under 5$ which never tarnished at all and it's still going strong hmmm I guess you just gotta make sure you read carefully.
1.0,I can't believe how awful this bra is. The mesh or what ever it is on the side easily poked a whole through the first day I put it on. It was too big and not made well. I spent more on this bra than I do from Adore Me or caciques! Save your money and buy from adore me or go and try on bras before wasting money.
1.0,Broke after putting on my daughter for 2 minutes
1.0,"PROS:<br /><br />Design<br /><br />Fits tightly around my face ; but not my husband’s face<br /><br />included 8 filters<br /><br />Easy to put on<br /><br />Does the job at blocking (at least, very significantly,  reduced odors for cinnamon and adobo)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Heavy<br /><br />Hard to take air in<br /><br />Feels like I’m suffocating  ( I do NOT have any respiratory diseases or lung issues )<br /><br />COMMENTS:<br /><br />It will probably do the job at blocking the COVID virus; but it is too difficult to breathe in - that is why I am giving it a one star"
1.0,I wanted a yellow stone as advertised. The one I received  was orange. Will not be able to wear.
1.0,Not satisfied with this product. Purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother in law. She wore them 1 time and now they are trash
1.0,"This material is so itchy in the areas where the mesh attaches at the shoulders and my biceps. I will not wear this again, it is a waste of money."
1.0,Very cheap item. Arrived bent and out of shape.
1.0,ordered3 pair
1.0,"I alternate wearing my sunglasses. Thus I haven’t worn these sunglasses on a consistently regular bases. I thought they were an Ok pair (not great, but Ok). After about a month, the right lens popped out while I was wearing them. Lens will not fit back in. Waste of money. Definitely won’t purchase again."
1.0,"Didn't use, waste of money. Band needs to be wider, continually rolled down"
1.0,$35 for a sock with a logo on it
1.0,small in neck and sleeves. (posted as big and tall)
1.0,"unfortunately this is a junk, the lens is not even clear and i would not recommend this product to anyone. you pay what you get"
1.0,"I bought the Baleaf Women's Waterproof Windproof Outdoor Softshell Jacket Microfleece Lined Black as the weather has been getting a bit colder where I live. I wanted a jacket, but did want to overspend. I thought this jacket was reasonably priced. However, I wore this jacket for maybe 3 times and then the zipper got stuck. Shortly after it completely broke."
1.0,"Asian size, not average size!"
1.0,I'm beyond disappointed in the fit (I got a large and I'm am a solid large or xl but these were too big) AND there was a random black string hanging out of the bright red butt!
1.0,I bought this because I thought it looked neat. But when it arrived it turned out to be a very cheaply made shirt. It tore easily and wasn't made of courdory but rather made to look like it was.  Do not buy. However customer service for the return was smooth.
1.0,"This was the cheapest-looking article of clothing I've ever bought on Amazon. The fabric was like that of a thin cheap windsock. It feels awful on skin. It was completely see-through. They lined the pants ONLY to the length of a pair of shorts, so you can totally see where the lining ends. Simply awful."
1.0,Extremely small amount with a poor applicator.
1.0,"The ""14k gold"" plating wore off after wearing a few times. Now the bracelets are just ugly metal beads. Very disappointing!"
1.0,"This was way too tight, definitely not true to size. The picture portrays a flow-y fit and that’s not the case. The fabric was printed and a very stiff material. The actual worst. I’ll be returning immediately!"
1.0,Not comfortable and  made of kind of hard material..
1.0,"I order a small size, but I received a large one. The texture likes low quality."
1.0,Tights came with defective stitching. I was planning to wear them tonight for New Years but can’t because they have poor stitching that looks like runs in the hose 😑
1.0,"I thought because the item was white gold plated that it would not turn my finger green....unfortunately, I could only wear for a couple days before it started turning. Looks beautiful though, and may be good for occasional wear."
1.0,No hem. Hand cut ends. Looks like they were done with a pair of scissor.
1.0,To short!!!!!
1.0,A real piece of junk. Stops working during the night and my watch was never wound in the morning.  Returned it.
1.0,The top is to small and to short! It would be great if it was real US sizes!
1.0,The clasp was sprung and didn’t work when I got it. Not very good quality.
1.0,Not good it's said 3x.but seem like a 1x
1.0,These broke after the first time I wore them
1.0,"Horrible horrible horrible...the ""gold"" plated was already faded off of it when I received it. It's like it was used, returned, and sent to me. Horrible, I'm just scared to even use it. Will not be using it, it's just thrown in a drawer now, I should really just throw it away. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"
1.0,Not suitable for my use.<br />I wear it on the top of a net that holds my dialysis tube connectors. The plastic velcro catches the net before I could strap it around. Then I have to cut the net off & throw it away.
1.0,The quality was poor
1.0,This is definitely not worth the price. It is literally just a long T shirt with pockets made it in. The material is ok. It will definitely shrink in the wash.  I was not happy with it so I sent it back. If it was like 10$ I would have kept it but definitely not for 20$<br /><br />Save your money and just go purchase a xxl men’s T-shirt.
1.0,Washing a big cat with thin leather dominatrix gloves is a Fools Folly.  Biting force of sharp cat fangs was not taken into consideration.  I could even feel the claws poke through like hyperdemic needles as I attempted to bath my furry fanged monster.  Shaggy-2-Fang remains unwashed as continue to heel and come up with plan B.
1.0,"I wear a size large shirt. I buy large sized shirts from numerous makers that all fit well. Maybe this is a large in China, but at best it's a medium in America. Material was also cheap and very thin.<br /><br />On the plus side, I got to know how bodybuilders feel when they're bulging out of their shirts!"
1.0,Wore it for 10 minutes at the band broke off and the back of the watch fell out.  Would not recommend at all.
1.0,Hat was made poorly DO NOT BUY !!<br />Wasn't even a snapback....
1.0,ordered and paid for 2 only received one. I gave the one I received as a gift.
1.0,I brought the first one it was great and shinny. But it was too long for me so I return it and immediately brought the second one. But it came here with dark color looks like it has been put on the shelf for very long time.
1.0,"what they sent was NOTHING like the picture. They sent me a very THICK, NAVY BLUE 3/4 sleeve sweater. I wanted this for a red carpet event in Vegas. It looked very cool and perfect for my dress. Im very disappointed. I returned it same day. 😭"
1.0,"I'm sad as i write this review , after maybe a month this ring changed my finger green"
1.0,I received a completely different model.
1.0,"worked for two days - haven't been able to get it to pair w/ my phone since; not sure if it's a charging issue like others proclaimed, but def low quality.....<br /><br />i guess you get what you pay for.  so now i have a 'chunky' hat for $12.  easier to just put my ear buds in under my hat."
1.0,Returned. This was excessively heavy. And I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be.
1.0,All to little
1.0,"All three necklaces broke, cheap don’t buy"
1.0,"Not gold, it turn into a different color"
1.0,Jacket body fit but the arms were to tight.
1.0,The sterling silver parts sounds fake. It got rusted and turned into a red color after using only few times :(
1.0,Save your money. Very flimsy. Would break with little pressure.  I’m sorry I bought it & didn’t return it.
1.0,The audacity of companies that take advantage of fans excited to get a copy of a prop. This overpriced kitchen glove is made of latex and has the “infinity stones” glued into place. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR ANY FAN OF THE MOVIE!!!
1.0,"This product does not come with a battery pack. It also does not mention that it doesn't come with one. Sizes run small, cheaply made and battery pack holder is an outside pocket with only a single button."
1.0,"Zero stars, yup, that's right, I said ZERO stars for this product. One star is way too much and undeserved. It's the worst luggage set ever. I usually don't write reviews, but this set is so horrible, it compelled me to submit one. In fact, I think Amazon or the seller owes me a full refund for selling such items...<br />This is what 2 of my pieces look like after their inaugural trip, yes, my first and only trip with this set. I had to buy new luggage at my destination so I won't have to be carrying my clothing in my hands...<br />Think the pics sufficiently depict the horrible performance and durability of this set that failed like the titanic. And yes, they were relatively cheap compared to bigger brands, but they should have at least survived one complete trip, or what's the use. They couldn't even get me to my destination..."
1.0,they were to short and i threw them away i really didn't feel like bothering to return
1.0,I purchased this item in a size 3X and when it arrived it was extremely small.  My daughter who weighs 1151bs was able to wear it and it was just a little large for her. This it was very disappointing and I am returning it.
1.0,broke after very light use is not worth the money
1.0,It was not braided together it fell apart the day I got it.
1.0,The blue stone on top fell off fifteen minutes after we took it out of the packing.
1.0,"Only a few weeks into wearing this and I've lost a stone on the side of the engagement ring. It's pretty but not secure, and I can't figure out how to use the warranty they said it had.<br /><br />Edit- I was contacted quickly by the seller who is sending me a replacement for my ring. Great customer service."
1.0,"Bought this based on my size. Way too small, no stretch, extremely tight by the thighs. Can't even bend my knees 90 degrees. The description states these pants are suitable for camping, hiking, outdoor work; I couldn't even walk comfortably in these.."
1.0,Bought a 36h it fit my sister's 36D
1.0,I should have paid attention to the comments made.<br />This too big.<br />I brought a 0-3 months. But it is like 3 - 6 months. I don't recommend purchasing because the sizes are too large.
1.0,"Terrible, waste of money!"
1.0,Top was way too small especially if you have big breasts. fabric was nice but there’s no way the girl in the photo had the same shirt that was delivered to me. I usually but a small because I like a snug fit but ordered a medium and there’s no way I’m wearing this. Breasts would be hanging out the bottom.
1.0,So I actually don't know how this product fits or looks because when I got it it was covered in some weird powder so I never took it out of the package. I really like the style and wanted to keep it but I'm not washing and keeping something I cant try on. And I now have to go to the ups store over 30 minutes away for an item that came in crap condition!!!!!
1.0,The zipper broke really fast :(
1.0,I returned this item on January 20 2023. Have not received the refund money in my account yet. The coat took forever to get and then the fit was wrong. Again I returned the coat and haven't gotten my money back. Very disappointing!!
1.0,I dislike that what is shown on the person wearing the mask on Amazon and Amazon vide does NOT LOOK LIKE WHEN ARRIVE!!!!<br />The mask is very light like you could of made without of a lightweight handkerchief and added a cheap zipper on.<br />NOT PLEASED AT ALL and the cost was a rip off😡<br />AMAZON SURE PUSHED ME UNDER THE BUS😡
1.0,I order this because I like the stlye but once I received it yesterday it was broken when I put it together but it stay in place when on my wrist so I thought I fixed it but I didn't it fell off my hand and broke my watch I would not recommend this to anyone I was very disappointed because this band when the closes to gold I could find
1.0,This dress looks like the display on the mannequin not the models. Please review the pictures very carefully on this item.
1.0,The shoes lights only lasted 5 days!!!!
1.0,"These look like someone just cut a piece of material and called it a headband. The edges are uneven and not finished so the minute you stretch them a little to use them they begin to fray. Adorable pattern/colors but sending them back, not worth it."
1.0,"One of them fit great, the other one was way too tight. I considered returning them but I would have paid just as much in shipping both ways as I did for the product. Two thumbs down!!"
1.0,Found a hole in the crutch area seen before first use
1.0,"I bought these for work, and I sincerely regret it. They were very painful to put in, and difficult to take out, because they're too short. To make matters worse, they're INCREDIBLY visible, because the top sticks out... Would not recommend these."
1.0,Had to shorten the fringe a little and they have a horrible odor.
1.0,i got this for my Halloween party and it was awful the top was way too big and bottom of the dress way too small My day was ruined i couldn't do anything.  i bought it a size bigger than i normally wear
1.0,It is not at all what I expected. It's terribly tiny!
1.0,"Really cheaply made. But what can you expect for the price. I was hopeful since I saw some positive reviews. I’m returning it. And I think it’s a little short, I’m only 5’4 and it hits mid thigh."
1.0,The scarves are fair at bare minimum ...I would never purchase them again ...
1.0,Site states these shirts are 100% cotton and they absolutely are not.
1.0,This is very thick and not as comfortable and cozy as pictures make it seem. I felt like I was dressing like my grandma in it. Returned!
1.0,The mesh is held on on the edges by tape so it gets to you safely but once you put it on one odd movement and it'll tear right through. I now have a huge piece of useless gold mesh.
1.0,"Was not light, sheer or chiffon<br />Pretty thick actually, just wanted a pretty sheer ""cover up"""
1.0,If this is sterling silver why is it tarnished?!  None of my other sterling silver bracelets have tarnished.
1.0,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! Not worth the money I paid. Looks like a cheap pair of sunglasses from a dollar store!! Very disappointed.
1.0,Verry disappoint
1.0,If your tall I’m sure it would work but you’d have to be pretty tall
1.0,Just got pkg and was excited till I tried on!  Cheap material not worth the $$$$$ and completely C-thru even though has a slip under dress!  Horrible fit!  Uncomfortable!!  Don't bother to purchase just a waste of money !!!
1.0,"It’s no same as picture, color different, lines different , material Pic is another model Cheap material"
1.0,Too small! Not true to size! Money wasted.
1.0,Very thin fabric and did not stay up around nose/face.  They were too loose.  Do not recommend.
1.0,"VERY NICE COLORS, but the quality of the fabric leaves to be desired. Very thin."
1.0,Viewing this item on line it looked great I gave it 1 star only because the color was beautiful it would fit me if only I had a wrist the size of a 5 yr old so if u have a average size adult wrist male or female do not buy this
1.0,These are cute shorts but extremely poor quality. The yellow shorts are so thin you can see through them. Definitely cannot wear out in public but OK for pajamas or wearing around the house.
1.0,Strap broken in 1 hour
1.0,Cheap and not accurate sizing
1.0,"Wow, so disappointed. These glasses don't work. I have another pair coming. Hopefully these are just really defective. Received second pair of glasses. They are just as bad as first pair. Very disappointed. Will be returning. I want to add I had two other people try these glasses just to make sure it wasn't just me. They had the same issue also."
1.0,Poor quality too big
1.0,This is a beautiful bracelet. I truly enjoyed wearing it. And then it broke.
1.0,"Very cheap looking, the crystals fall out very easily."
1.0,Very poorly made very disappointing
1.0,Tiny wrist strap
1.0,It’s way to big .. and the colors are not like the pic
1.0,This dress is marketed to be the opposite of what it actually is. For starters it fits more like an oddly shaped body con dress and doesn’t look flattering at all. Sleeves are really cheap; sending it back to amazon.
1.0,the dress fit as is should but the darts in the front were crooked and lopsided. Returned
1.0,"I wanted to like these based on the other reviews but they are just so obviously cheap! The craftsmanship of these and quality is horrible. Not only do they wrinkle if you look at them wrong the stitching is a mess. They have threads hanging out everywhere, the seems are sewn on the outside and they just look and feel cheap. Ordered these in 2 different colors wanting to enjoy them but no way. On top of the quality they run very small."
1.0,"I bought two rings and ordered the same size rings I already have but both of these rings were smaller than expected, too small to wear."
1.0,"Like some, ended up with what appears to be a knockoff. Pattern is not the same as depicted, poor copy, and the material was stiff, not loose as mentioned in the web description. Returning and will try another seller, as I really like the pattern as shown on the web. Was hoping to wear to a function this weekend! :-("
1.0,My outfit was not made like pictured out...Very upset by this!
1.0,The plane was larger than I expected.
1.0,I got 3x and doesn't fit. Way too small. I'm 36 DD. Even if it did fit it would give no support. very flimsy and cheaply made. For the same money I could have got a much better bra at Walmart.
1.0,"Do not buy, these are terrible. Single layer of dense silk-like fabric which does not allow air to expel.  During any exertion, the fabric will form a barrier over the face and nose.  Ultimately, you will up wearing the mask sideways to lineup the mesh holes for air.  Which defeats the purpose and eliminates any aerosol barrier."
1.0,"Broke within a week. Don't waste your money! Made of cheap material, not sturdy at all. If I could rate no stars I would."
1.0,Not the greatest quality. Bought it and never used it.
1.0,Way to small. Pictures are misleading..guess I should have tead the measurements
1.0,Only received 91 pieces and one with out the balls.
1.0,Too small and uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,Everything was good EXCEPT the pants were WAY TOO SHORT! I’m only 5’5 and 143 Lbs!!! They came above my ankles!!!
1.0,"Maybe the seller now has a different manufacturer? Because what I got is clearly not what are in the pictures, or what the people received before.<br />-No front pockets by the hips/thighs area<br />-No pocket in the left chest area<br />-No collar<br />-Main zipper just goes straight down, instead of it being a little tilted to the right and having a flap inside<br />-Zipper on the right chest area goes nowhere. It's not even a pocket!<br />I was expecting for the material to be flimsy, sure, but I picked this one mainly because of the front and chest pockets so it's really disappointing when it looks completely different from the sellers' and review pictures."
1.0,Rinse way to small returned
1.0,"Heavy , did not fit well"
1.0,This purse seemed fine.  But now the zipper is broken.  Would NOT recommend this.
1.0,"No wonder they don't answer your complaints, it's had enough to find the discounted price on Facebook."
1.0,This is made really huge I wish I could return for a smaller size but amazon messier now days
1.0,it is not the correct size<br /><br />not happy
1.0,"Couldn't  tell, the bra didn't  make it to my body  for me to evaluate."
1.0,Nothing to like except the return was easy.  Felt like a rag not outerware.
1.0,I need a refund for this product. NOT A REPLACEMENT.<br />I MISTAKENLY RECEIVED A REPLACEMENT. EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE IM SENDING BACK. HELP!
1.0,"The material for these t-shirts is so cheap-- its pills up very quickly, and becomes rough and scratchy after a few washes. Won't buy again."
1.0,They are very small and will only fit a five or six year old. It’s sad because this was a gift that I mailed out only for it to be garbage. Total waste of money. Also the material is very cheap.
1.0,Beautiful little ring I purchased it for a thumb ring I evenSized up a half a size for comfort and it was still small so it does not run true to size
1.0,Poorly made. Discoloration occurred within 2 months. Definitely would not recommend.
1.0,3 of the bags zippers ripped within a couple days!<br />waste of money on these!!
1.0,"2 in a row were defective, the shoulder straps would not stay in place once adjusted. Contacted manufacturer, and was told it was a manufacturing error and no repair was available."
1.0,"These are horrible panties. I purchased these 7 months ago bc of price and ratings. How this got good ratings is beyond me. Everyone of these 10 lace panties has holes/ tears in them now and that started happening not long after purchase. Not only that, I don't wear panties everyday (because I'm savage like that.)  I mean, who's gonna feel sexy in holy panties? Not me. Nope. More like &#34;trailer park panties.&#34;"
1.0,"The print looks just like in the photo and the fabric is decent, but the cut of the pants was completely off, it’d probably work for a woman with no curves but as for me I needed to keep readjusting them because they kept sliding down."
1.0,"Does not fit/click into FitBit Sense 3, had to return"
1.0,causes blisters
1.0,"This is the cheapest quality product.  The threading on seems is already falling apart.  I am guessing that once I wash this, it will get worse.  I only ordered from Amazon because I am going on a trip and don't have time to go shopping.  Very very disappointed."
1.0,Short & thin material
1.0,I bought L black ones that were fine ordered white and they came in size S with a L tag.
1.0,"This is an awful, scratchy and itchy polyester fabric that should have never been made into any garment.<br />The style and fit was fine. I had bought this same dress last year in navy but the fabric content was reversed, mostly cotton.<br />It was misleading to say it was a cotton and polyester blend. Makes the consumer think it's more cotton than polyester since it's listed first.<br />I ordered XL as I did last time since I was told it runs extra small. I normally wear a M.<br />Seller charges for returns.<br />Do not buy."
1.0,"Really not a great fit, the pretty part around the bust was not adjusted to the size of the dress. Like they used the same size bust from a small as an XL. I don't know how to explain it well, but it did not look right at all. The rest of the dress was darling, but I returned it due to the strange fit of the bust."
1.0,2x is about the size of med
1.0,"Broke after a day of wearing it for my boyfriend , mine broke after a few days."
1.0,Disliked these items. Poor construction. Difficult to snap close without assistance.  Poor quality in materials.
1.0,"This is a horrible excuse for a dress.  It looks nothing like the picture, more like a Halloween costume.  The icing on the cake? You can't return it to the fake address provided. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!"
1.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  It fell apart the day I received the key chain.
1.0,"Top is way to small. I ordered XL. The top is barely a medium at best. It was made well, but the sizing is way off. Almost teen size. Too bad.."
1.0,There aweful
1.0,"First off the color was wrong. The ribbon for the corset back was too short.  Horrible customer service.  I have tried many times to get the dress returned, since it should be free. I got a a cartoon picture of a man holding a package. Asking for a refund now."
1.0,Not true to size and thin denim material
1.0,"I bought a few pairs of these at one time. Sadly, my favorite color pair (mountain lilac) has recently developed separation (a small hole) around the gusset stitching area (the crotch). I’ve only worn these a dozen times (if that). They are the correct size and I’ve cared for them properly...they should not be doing this! Fortunately, the black and wine color pairs I got at the same time have not started to do this yet, but I’m very concerned now. Since I was beyond the amazon return window, I tried to contact the brand/company directly via email, but did not receive any response... I really loved them, up until this discovery! I’m so disappointed in the lack of durability, especially for something claiming to be “squat-proof”!<br /><br />***update 1/17/19*** Reduced my rating from two stars to one star. The brand/company finally got back to me. Essentially, they don’t stand behind their own products, even though amazon is an authorized retailer for them. These weren’t my first purchase from this brand, but unfortunately due to this quality issue and total lack of proper resolution, I will not be buying anything made by this brand in the future."
1.0,"For the price, I thought this came with all of the colors shown. Although, that’s my fault for assuming. The product came and was essentially a $9 piece of string. Went to use it today and it doesn’t even work- one side doesn’t snap in. Huge waste of time and money."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR.......TOTAL CRAP, YEAH, I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR.....CHEAP, BROKEN JEWELRY....didn't want to spend more to return it than I did to buy the broken peice of garbage."
1.0,It's kinda small and I got a bigger size
1.0,All the earrings are much larger in size than I e pecked so I will be sending all of them back
1.0,I wore this shirt once and washed it once. Has several holes.
1.0,"Product felt like ok quality and print was really cute. However, it only lasted on for an hour of light to no activity before becoming unattached where the band meets the watch. Returning."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4662d04126f6d8d294c20f106f9cfc6d]] I wanted this item for a pool birthday party but was unable to use it because the pattern is out of wack. It’s completely open on the back side in two areas.  Also some white stains.
1.0,Need to exchange for smaller size
1.0,Charm had incorrect wording
1.0,"They came with no earring backs, and they do not stay in your ears. There isn’t a hook, cheaply made. Obviously"
1.0,i was wearing it for one day and it got lost becouse the it opened bc its a piece of junk!
1.0,"Very, very, very poor quality fabric and construction. Awful!!! I returned it right away."
1.0,Nothing like the picture! Won’t be buying again from this brand.
1.0,The hook broke the first time I attempted to put it on.
1.0,Very small. Not stretchy. Wouldn’t even go up my thighs and I’m thin. Don’t recommend.
1.0,"Sadly I have never and will never wear this shirt. As soon as I tried it on it was way bigger than expected, and fabric is thick and weird, making it sit and hang awkwardly."
1.0,"I wear a 9.5 shoe and these fit a shoe size of 8-12.  Not only are they tight, they are so thin that I can see my skin through the sock.  I was worried I would rip the socks the first time I put them on.  I expect them to snag the first time in the wash.  I will try to be optimistic, but I do not expect them to last more than a few months.  I will definitely not buy these again."
1.0,"Got an xs. seller was friendly. I am probably more of an xxs but the corset was fine anyway. Very cute but broke the 1st time I wore it for an hour. For that much money, save it for a quality corset."
1.0,Wanted to love it but one of them broke the first day.
1.0,"This dress is short. The photo makes it look long ,but it is very short and skimpy."
1.0,"Very disappointed, because this charm was so tarnished when I received it. It was black. It was the only charm that I have ordered that I have had to polish. When things are purchased, they should not come in that shape, no matter what they cost."
1.0,the jacket does not look like the picture it is made very bad the sleeves are to tight the lining was hanging out of the jacket nit was an awful made product......never buy from you again
1.0,"Terrible, do not purchase. You can read the newspaper through this shirt."
1.0,"The product is nothing as expected.....it is too small, 3 sizes too small and was not made well. I am currently having issues with my refund. I returned the item, at my cost, via UPS 2nd day AIR and have yet to hear fromt he buyer or see a refund. Buyers beware!"
1.0,Smaller then my actual size and I got the 10mm
1.0,The bottoms are see through! We can’t even wear them. Disappointed.
1.0,This blazer has too short of sleeves and sizing needs to be 3 X bigger than a US size and still too short.<br />Have to ship to China and UPS rep said over $200 to ship back still working with Amazon to get assistance they are normally more than fair.
1.0,"The polish does work. But for how long? The lid is a joke, it will not shut and seal properly. And this will cause the wax to dry out over time. I'll be looking elsewhere next time. This is one of those problems that comes with buying on the internet."
1.0,Odd and looks cheap
1.0,"Tiny in the bust area, unbelievably so! Incredibly cheap material, you can see it before you even try it on. Returning it ASAP."
1.0,Runs WAY smaller than normal.
1.0,"Bought this for the boyfriend and we put it on the phone straight out of the factory box. It only has an adhesive backing around the rim of the shield, so after about 30 minutes it just straight up fell off. Save your money."
1.0,"Poor construction/design means these won’t last. Both ahoes stopped working within the same 7 day period. One of them has a visible cable that is detached from the trigger. The other shoe looks fine, it just doesn’t work.<br /><br />If you’re getting these for the lights, don’t."
1.0,Chain broke immediately and cannot be repaired. Needed to purchase a new chain and this was a gift.
1.0,"The rubber sole is too heavy and the fabric part is too elastic and flexible. The sock does not hold tight, flops and can cause tripping hazard."
1.0,I liked the idea of the shoulders but when I went to put it on the zipper came off as soon as you zipped it down and when you try to take it off it rips even easier. So be aware of that otherwise I would of loved it.
1.0,My shirt came with black oily stains all over it....like it was dragged across a parking lot.  Smelled weird too. Returned for full refund.  Won't buy again.
1.0,"I repeat: there are no ear loops. They are also VERY small. My 5 year old is the size of a 3 year old and the best she can do is wear it as a headband. If you’re into that, they are great, but they are not at all as described for the purpose of a mask."
1.0,"Terrible. First, it was shipped in an envelope rather than a box so it was smashed flat. Second, it's HUGE! You need a BIG noggin to hear this thing without it sinking down past your ears. Now we have to pray we can find one in time for Halloween to complete my son's Dr. Who costume. Very disappointed."
1.0,SEE TRUE
1.0,"So I ordered this item in a 2XL and I am usually 1XL so I always size up when shopping online for dusters/kimono/sweaters; but this fits tight around my biceps and close to my shoulders. I could somewhat overlook that, BUT the sleeves are so scratchy. They are also long. I tried to ignore it, but the scratchy feeling bothers me too much.The material feels inexpensive and for the price I have honestly had better quality ones. I've requested a return since this ships from China it says I have to wait for the seller to &#34;approve&#34; my request smh. I'll update when I get and answer."
1.0,"IS REALLY CUTE,BUT IT  ARRIVED IN A PACKAGE SO SMALL AND SO TIGHT FOR THE PIECE  TO FIT THAT WHEN I OPEN IT I CUT  IT,RUIN IT WITHOUT RIGHT OF REFUND OF MONEY, OF COURSE,"
1.0,So small it hurt my head
1.0,This was at least 2 sizes too small.  Order up.  Waaaay up
1.0,Runs 10 minutes fast in just 1 hour of elapsed time
1.0,Waist of penny....
1.0,I should have returned it.  It is not sized for an American woman. I washed it and hung it up to dry and it still shrunk.
1.0,toooo big and the right screw fell out as soon as i opened them
1.0,Arrived with a tear between the right breast pocket and center. No damage to the packaging. Material seems flimsy.
1.0,"You get what you pay for I guess.  Its so cheap and crappy, don't waste your money.  Seriously."
1.0,THE DRESS IS VERY CHIP AND XXXXXXLARGE
1.0,If I could give less stars I would. These broke right after opening the package. They are very fragile. I went to grab a spoon and one of them broke right in half. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money.
1.0,It broke as soon as I tried to put it on
1.0,Not a pleat or draping in sight.
1.0,poor quality - broke quickly
1.0,so disappointed in this product ---stone fell out before even being worn
1.0,"Waist folds,not very comfortable,<br />No stretch,<br />Camel toe<br />I returned"
1.0,"Definitely not as advertised, no support or lift whatsoever. Don't waste the money."
1.0,It took a long time to get here. It smelled toxic like it was treated with pesticides. I tried washing it and it still smelled toxic. I got rid of it.
1.0,It runs very small. And not at pretty as in the photo.
1.0,"I have now re orders this three time.. hopefully this will be the last. The batter was dead, then the second hand completely fell off!!  Santa brought it for my son, so that’s why I keep replacing it... but not good quality unfortunately. Luckily my son loves it though..."
1.0,Not as advertised at all! Waited nearly 6 weeks to get them and they aren’t even the sizes pictured. Was supposed to be 7 stones totaling 100cts. I received 12 stones totaling approximately 90cts. At closer look you can see they have been dyed blue. Lowest possible quality stone you could receive. Even after telling me they would send replacements if I removed my comment I have not received any further information so I think it’s important for buyers to beware! Order these at your own risk!
1.0,"La costura se descose, lo reemplace 2 veces y el mismo problema"
1.0,Fabric is thin and jacket looks cheap. Jacket also does not look like picture and does not fit oversized as in pictures.
1.0,Doesn't have pockets on bottom like advertised or top. Center strap can't be removed. Feels like they stole Piscifun's description of their fishing bag and copy pasted it onto theirs. Going to return and buy Piscifun.
1.0,I wish Amazon would review all 3rd party sellers. So many including this one sell inferior merchandise.<br />I’m surprised Amazon isn’t more diligent about who they represent. Once again I’m truly disappointed.
1.0,It’s a nice skirt but was way to big
1.0,"I know this is only $20 but don’t waste your time. The fabric is like a cheap tablecloth you buy from party works, it was sewed crooked and his kind of a hot mess lol and if you’re 6 foot tall, this isn’t long enough."
1.0,fell apart first time they were washed
1.0,"I really like these pants, however you should probably hand wash them.  Mine now have holes in them after only wearing 3 times."
1.0,"Product came all messed up, missing bells, so wrinkled and it fell apart in less than 8hrs of use."
1.0,"The pictures make it look like this is like a sweatshirt.  BEWARE - IT IS NOT!  It is a weird, cheap looking, shiny fabric.  That being said, it is on me as I did not read the description closely.  I just assumed it was cotton.  Also, it took forever to arrive.  I will be returning this top."
1.0,These socks came too large even for my boyfriend who is size 11. They are not the same socks as on the pictures from previous reviews. I was excited about these but have to return :(
1.0,"It’s polyester. Jersey knit would have been better. Returned, never got refunded"
1.0,Loved the product but it broke soon after wearing them.
1.0,Like a child’s size is even too big!
1.0,The shoes are very heavy! They fit ok but my 17 month old has a hard time walking in them due to the weight of the shoe.
1.0,glasses cover my whole face.
1.0,The material is too thin and the sizing is way off. It was too big.
1.0,"It might be kind of hard to tell in the photo, but the print on the shirt is horrible quality. Is not sharp and almost looks blurry. Along with that, there are a bunch of little white specs and the red area of the print. Very disappointing."
1.0,"Super tiny umbrella. It is waterproof, but not windproof. It will turn inside our. The size of this umbrella is appropriate for children under the age of 10"
1.0,"Dress was ripped at the seam, unable to to wear. Very disappointed"
1.0,"It is like a weird square. The length is almost correct to size, but the shape is so awkward no little body would fit it accurately...."
1.0,"Label on the hat that I received said ""black/purple"" but the pattern of colors on the hat received do not match the photo of this color selection as shown on line. In fact, I cannot find any photo on line that even resembles the hat that I received. Also, the hat has a rigid front brim. This is not clearly indicated in the photos to my eye or the description on line. Disappointed. Returned immediately."
1.0,Me quedo muy grande es M pero pare L tenia que pedir S
1.0,The outfit looks nothing like the picture . It's not sequin . I'm not satisfied at all !
1.0,"they sell pretty ones at urban outfitters, this one looks cheap, maybe I'll use it at the beach or pool"
1.0,They fall apart
1.0,"Received broken, fixed it myself"
1.0,"I did order the Royal blue color and received Navy blue color , requested Amazon to open a window with seller in Amazon app and thankful to Amazon they helped me in this , the seller did contact me and offered me that they will send the Royal blue this time and unfortunately they sent me the same navy blue color and they messed up with my dressing for an event , also with 1st try the buttons came a part and I I already had mentioned in my window to seller that the buttons are very loose even then they didn’t care about it , can be seen in photo , also the inside fabric for both vest are not the same and there is no brand label on vest , I am surprised !"
1.0,Material was nice but fit a lot smaller than expected
1.0,"When I took these out of the package I laughed because they were TINY!! Yes they stretch, but think pantyhose (all my 80s ladies, you know). Still, I had ordered a size up from what the chart recommended so I tried them on. It took a few minutes of pulling and squeezing. And once they were on I managed to squat before rolling them off of me into a staticky clump. I’m 5’6” and 140lbs. I have chubby legs but I was below the inches they listed in their sizing. To sum up: nylon nightmare, suffocating material, might have fit my 8 year old, static cling."
1.0,"Great color but I had to order it twice in 2 sizes but my 7 year old, who is long and skinny and only weighs 48 lbs couldn't wear the 7/8 or 10/12. It was made for really short children only.  I had to cut apart the bottom from the top and add more fabric for it to work for her Halloween costume because we ran out of time having to return and reorder."
1.0,does NOT work with my Apple Air laptop!
1.0,Did not fit ... runs very small... size large more like a small... returned the item... will not refund ...
1.0,Broke first time I put them on my daughter. Had to gorilla glue but still didn’t work
1.0,Size chart not accurate
1.0,The size sent was what I ordered but was not representative what the size should have been.  It was very small.
1.0,Feels like a dollar store toy. I don't see any value for the money in it.
1.0,"All 3 pairs had a different prescription and it turns out nine were really progressive, so after I gave each one a full day trial run, I ended up throwing all 3 away."
1.0,What a ripoff. Didn’t last a month.<br />Just stop working.<br />Unfortunately the return window is already closed.
1.0,Cute jacket but made extremely cheap. Cuffs and zipper were destroyed after 1st wash
1.0,Fit big in the shoulders and small in stomach and waist.  Don't waste your money. Bad design and fit
1.0,"My daughter is 4, and I ordered the 4-6.... she is taller than average and very thin but it's not even close to fitting! Its way too small. it would fit my 24 month old! And I needed it for her birthday next week. I don't have time to return it and get a replacement. Really disappointed. :-("
1.0,Body on dress too short.... is more of a teen dress
1.0,hangs like a potato sack.....sent it back
1.0,product keeps shrinking every time you wash it
1.0,The straps are very hard to attach and detach. The fabric is of ok quality.
1.0,Glasses are much larger than expected but they do cut down the glare as I hoped they would.
1.0,The quality is too steep for the price.
1.0,It felt like a rubbery bathroom rug.
1.0,The plastic thing on the strap broke just like how it did in every review for this product.<br /><br />This is no way the real deal product from Nintendo.
1.0,These pajamas are not faltering whatsoever.  They hang awful.  They look frumpy.  There just not quality.  I missed the return date or I would have returned them. I always write a review on everything I buy and I always read the reviews before I buy anything.  I do all my shopping on Amazon.  This is an honest review.
1.0,Doesn't look at all like the picture. I thought I was getting blues but I got black. The designs is different as well. Do not buy from this vender.
1.0,"Didn't stay on, kinda awkward and kinda tugged on the ears."
1.0,they are very lightweight but the nose piece broke off one day after having them you would have to be very particular how you use them they're very delicate and break easy
1.0,If I could give a zero I would.  It would not stay tight on my arm.
1.0,The color is pretty but the fit is terrible the neck is too tight.
1.0,"Band is way too tight. Within five minutes my ears were swollen and red, bad headache. No amount of adjusting was helpful."
1.0,"Half of the pairs had holes after wearing only once.  Cute socks, but not good quality"
1.0,Cheap material !! No like it ..
1.0,"Didn't get the right color at all.  Received a dark, dark cobalt blue.  Kept it because she needed it, but really?  Still waiting on the other hat, hope that's at least the correct color."
1.0,Would not cover over my glasses
1.0,Dress Fit until it was washed now it is a shirt...
1.0,"Way too small. A little bit bigger than the size of my hand. I returned it, and I was charged an extra $5. Hmmm"
1.0,"Looks junkie, feels hunky."
1.0,Had it for one day.<br />The metal bar that holds it to the watch itself already broke....<br />I do not recommend.
1.0,Had to return. Wrong size and color
1.0,These septum rings suck. They are externally threaded and the balls don't even stay on. Definitely wouldn't waste my money again
1.0,Used for school costume. Metal in the wing tore through the seam the fist day used.
1.0,It tore first week I had it
1.0,"Did not work at all, did not return because the hat is good but should have."
1.0,"Once again, you get what you pay for. Broke after a couple of washes."
1.0,"XXL shirts should not be for thin guys. Loved the look, but it's not for a fat guy"
1.0,"The picture on here does not look anything like what I received.  They are super thin, and have fake looking colors.  They are horrible.  I threw them away."
1.0,Very bad poor matirial ... I just send back ... do not recommend
1.0,"Highly disappointed in your product!  The font used on the key chain strap was way too small can’t even read it!  So ridiculous, will never order your products again!  I will not recommend your products to any of my family or friends!"
1.0,So I’ve had to buy these lenses many times because they are cheap they say ultra durable blah blah but the slightest touch of anything to the lenses scratches the mirror finish no matter how hard you try to keep them in good shape. Wish they were better at not scratching! I’ve had many different color finishes too none better than the other. Hey but it’s kinda expected at 20$ or less cuz the Oakley brand one are like 60$ but now since I’ve had so many probably could of had 2 pairs from Oakley by now.
1.0,this dress is  a nightmare. I can usually fix things up there is nothing really I can do with this but maybe use it for a Halloween costume. came on time that is one good thing
1.0,"Ordered a large, packaging said large but label on dress a medium. Wanted to wear dress to a party. Not happy."
1.0,"Cheap, no instructions"
1.0,"suit arrived and one of the metal clips in the back was hanging on by a thread. Super annoying, now I have to take it to get it fix. which cost as much as the suit. Not worth it"
1.0,Huge in the arm pits
1.0,Do not buy this product! The skirt you receive looks nothing like the picture. It is cheaply made and looks like someone just cut the shape of a skirt and didn't bother to hem it or anything. The skirt was NOT yellow but NEON GREEN. The pattern was different and there was no white stripes in it.
1.0,The text that says &#34;LED WATCH&#34; isn't a promo sticker or anything; it's actually printed on the watch.
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap.  I returned it because I was worried it would literally break if I tried wearing it. Trading it out for something around the same price but way better quality.
1.0,"Total crap , oversize & bad advertising. Not red it's more like Orange<br /> Very disappointed"
1.0,Sizes are no where near accurate
1.0,The hat was hard like cardboard and did not fit
1.0,"Fits too small. When attempted to return very discouraging. Stated “ not recommended to return. Customer pays shipping back and they might never get it, if not received no refund”."
1.0,"Love this necklace! Put it on my own chain though. Great color, shape, size, and vibes.<br />Edit: it broke the second day..."
1.0,Horrible carrying purse. Slips off should quite easily.
1.0,I was sensitive to the metal.
1.0,"I ordered 3 pairs of Heatwaves before I decided to spend $100 on this pair. All 3 of my previous purchases arrived in brand new condition, inside their own sliky-storage bag. This pair arrived in a crushed box with no bag. The Sunglasses were clearly used and returned at some point. They arrived with fingerprints, smudges, and oil from the previous owner. Disgusting."
1.0,Fabric bodice was to tight had no stretch.. fabric was poor quality thin and felt plastic .. not good for a summer dress
1.0,"I purchased the light silver dress in a size large. The quality of the material is very cheap looking, looked exactly like a tube of glitter pen. The elastic at the top was a bit tight and the material felt rough, like an itchy sweater. The material is stretchy but doesn't have that slouchy look like in the pictures, very deceiving."
1.0,"I disliked all about the product small af, cheap af, didn’t fit even my pinky and I had small fingers, what a waste of time and money I expected better from you Amazon 😞😒"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:50f71afb8550c4507395165f594fd112]] I just received it today and saw that there are holes ☹️ I’m so disappointed because the cloth was nice and soft.
1.0,Fabric every this.  Maybe for summer?  Definitely not for cold weather wear.
1.0,"Neck bands on 3 shirts so small can't fit head through, no give at all."
1.0,"I had to return these pants because they just looked terrible. I was thinking they could be a cheap replacement for some awesome linen pants I bought years ago from Anthropologie, but badly made pants with a bad cut just look terrible. And these were terrible on me."
1.0,"Seemed to be made cheap.. seams seem weak. Very thin cotton. I ordered xl thinking the size chart amazon posts was the same (40-42), but this xl was 42-44. I ordered colored hoping that i would at least get some colors,  but ended up with 2 pair of black, a gray pair and a navy blue pair. Not at all what was advertised. If you are looking for boxer briefs that feel as if you are not wearing underwear, pick these. If you want support,  look elsewhere."
1.0,"Very very small, not true to size."
1.0,After one wash it shrunk and especially on the sleeve area
1.0,"I feel like a complete fool! One whiff of the ""Nickel Alert"" and I could tell it was ammonia (with a thickening agent)<br />The suspected earrings did not test positive.  The included instructions pointed out, you could demonstrate a positive result by testing a U.S. nickel coin - sure enough, the swab turned pink. But, as I suspected the product was merely household ammonia, I soaked a swab in the bottle I keep around the house. Sure, it wasn't as pink as the ""Nickel Alert"", but it was pink.<br />The ""Nickel Guard""? No surprise - clear nail polish.  At $35, it's quite a deal - not!"
1.0,Didn't like the fit or material
1.0,Don’t buy it really I seen like that product
1.0,"I could not wear this shirt I am normally a Medium and I ordered a Large and this shirt was still too small. The arms fit tight and the waist line was tight as well. I am 5'2 and 130 lbs and this was a fail. The shirt is very thin, the material reminds you of the jersey knit type fabric, and it is not thick at all. It is more of a t-shirt and far from a sweater!"
1.0,"The Velcro doesn’t stay stuck in place. It came apart constantly and, within 3 wearing, one of the pads came apart and fell through my clothing and got lost. I didn’t realize it until I came home and looked in the mirror. One shoulder was higher than the other."
1.0,I have waited 1 month for this order to arrive....ITS NOT WORTH THE WAIT
1.0,"When we received them, they said they are size 30-32, and we really wanted a size 32.  They fit my son, but are very tight.  The last Guybond ones we bought were a much better fit."
1.0,"The description specifically says &#34;Towallmark(TM) Fashion Gothic Punk Temptation Cat Bite Ear Cuff Wrap Clip Earring&#34; but this is NOT a clip. I had purchased this as a present for my daughter who loves cats and does not have pierced ears. From the picture, it looks like it just sits across the top of the ear and possibly has something on the side to clip on. Not true. It is a pierced earring. Not only that, but it doesn't even have a real earring back - just a tiny plastic tip for the end of the post. Very disappointing."
1.0,This product does not meet the image projected on the website.
1.0,They started pilling and getting fuzzy after a few wears
1.0,"Lose shape very quickly, not flattering at all"
1.0,Was see through
1.0,The masks are unfinished. The filters are larger than the mask. The vents do not set in the holes cut too small.
1.0,This umbrella is very difficult to close.
1.0,"Not good at all, it broke the first day my girlfriend use it"
1.0,This item feels horrible.  It feels like the fabric they use for carpet padding.  I'll probably use it to clean my car.
1.0,Might as well wear underware and filter is two pieces of stiffer material sew together.<br /><br />Chinese junk..
1.0,It doesn’t look like the one that on the website material is very poor very disappointed I will never recommend this item to anyone and please save your money get it elsewhere. The shirt looks like came from the flea market not worth $22.00
1.0,I purchased this shirt to dye to match a pair of pants. It says in the material information listed above that it is made of 90% nylon but when the shirt arrived it says 90% polyamide on the tag. Polyamide does not dye with the dye I bought.
1.0,"Unfortunately I bought these at the end of the summer and my son did not go to use them until Thanksgiving weekend. As soon as he put them on his head, the plastic nose piece snapped and the goggles broke. We are outside the return window and are now stuck with them. Very disappointed since I bought a pair a few years ago and they have been great."
1.0,I didn’t really like the fit of the pants. I really loved the shirt. I felt like the pants were the wrong size. The fabric is soft and stretches.
1.0,"The material of the top is very thin, I definitely would not recommend buying this!! Even though it's cheap, you are better off spending a few more dollars on a better quality bikini!"
1.0,I bought size L. I barely could fit my head in it. It was like size XXS. The front crossed ribbons were off and positioned on different heights. All what was matching - was fabric print.
1.0,"Very cute but im pretty sure that  this is for teenagers,  not adults.  Wouldn't  fit over my shoulders  to even try on. Returning  this. . ."
1.0,I bought two sets and I didn't receive any white watches. I am very upset because I waited over a month.
1.0,Length too short. Product does not give adequate sizes
1.0,strings came off in the first 3 days of wearing it - poor quality
1.0,Cheap fabric ... poorly made ... didn’t wear it ... chucked it!
1.0,They broke the day after getting them they fell of my hand next thing you k ow the tip of both were broke...
1.0,See through and poor stitching.

1.0,The ring on top was crooked and it looks totally like you got it from a gumball machine
1.0,This item is incredibly small...
1.0,"Sweater not the same , it’s missing the heart on the sleeve"
1.0,"My daughter was super uncomfortable in these, I tossed the ones she wore for a few hours and donated the new ones to a shelter."
1.0,There was a stain on it and too small
1.0,"This bag started falling apart, the seams started to shred within a very short time of using it. So disappointing. I liked the size of the bag."
1.0,will be my worst underwear purchase！ It is very inappropriate. I was fooled by the pictures and descriptions. I actually ordered twice and I am too lazy to return it
1.0,This shirt was boxy and made me look matronly.
1.0,My teenager was so excited to get this mask. Unfortunately it was very large and had a weird shape that wouldn't have worked even if it hadn't been so big. Very disappointing!
1.0,"I purchased this dress for my aunt's funeral. According to the picture it looks like a classy dress. When the dress came it was clingy type material & the dress has gathers , Is hiked up on both sides like curtains. This is Definitely NOT a Classy type of dress nor one I would wear to my 86 y.o. Aunt's Funeral. This is NOT the type of dress you would even feel comfortable wearing in church. Club wear only !!"
1.0,"When we received it, it had a big crack in the corner and one of the latches wouldn't work. Very cheaply made. Very disappointed.  However, we did have good customer service."
1.0,Did not look good on me - I am 4'10&#34; and short-waisted.  This would look much better on someone taller and with a longer torso.
1.0,Sleeves are very baggy.
1.0,"The proportions are all wrong! And the skirt starts so high it’s on my chest, not my waist!"
1.0,Looks good only in the picture. Save your money
1.0,Looks good but u need a size larger.
1.0,Zipper broke shortly after received
1.0,The description says 85% cotton. What I got is a dress that is 95% Rayon and 5% Spandex. It's also way too big and stretchy
1.0,"Sorry it's not what I expect. Size too small for people of the Caribbean. So, I gave as a gift to my neighbor who is small size."
1.0,I had to send them back. They are way too heavy and I had fear they would eventually tear my ears.
1.0,"I wanted to love this adorable little band, however it started to peel after two weeks. The return was not a problem, very easy."
1.0,"They weren't very stretchy, no pockets, not what I was expecting."
1.0,Very cheap thin fabric. It also has a lot of lint which ruined a black sweater when I wore the scarf around my neck.
1.0,"Would have been a very beautiful and unique ring but, there was a stone missing out of it. That should have been caught before shipped out."
1.0,Absolute garbage not even a month later and both nose pieces are off and the right lens keeps popping out! I attempted to return but cannot find where I put the second pair. Stinks for me.... don’t buy !!!!
1.0,Unless your head is the size of a small child this is not for you.
1.0,The size of the garment I ordered is not the size I received. Other than that the outfit is really cute.
1.0,"You get what you pay for, $7.<br /><br />Terrible quality. Would not recommend. You can do way better for $10 on Amazon"
1.0,Broke within 2 weeks of wearing it and lost the charm.
1.0,"This was a bummer.  I should know better than to look at a photo of a skinny model and think I'm going to look as cute in a shirt!  I'm chesty and a size XL.  Instead of looking cute in this, I just looked like I was wearing a square shirt with tight little arms from the elbow down.  Big no. Not even a &#34;maybe&#34; came to mind - they went back."
1.0,La calidad de la tela no es la que esperaba
1.0,Huge!!!! I bought a medium hoping to fit my baby bump(23 weeks)... It fits like an XXL!!!! Get your normal size or size down. The color is super cute.. I got teal. But I would never wear it. Prob use it as a rag since I can't return it.
1.0,I bought 2 necklaces only received one and that one broke before I even got a chance to wear it.
1.0,It’s too much bling for a commando watch. Spend about twice the price of this one and get the all black model.
1.0,The small is more like a medium.
1.0,"Not the sweater pictured 😢 It is way thinner than expected from the looks of the pictures. Also the mauve pink color is a lot more of a light hot pink in person, wish I would have gotten a different color since the pink looks completely different. It’s more of a thick long sleeve shirt rather than a sweater 🙁"
1.0,This broke before I ever even put it on
1.0,Not with it don’t buy unless you want blue skin. And it looks nothing like the picture
1.0,"The material is very cheap, see through, and runs extremely big! I ordered a Small for my daughter and it fit me and I’m an XL. I wouldn’t buy it again."
1.0,"leg warmers were very cheaply made.To loose on the legs, could not get them to stay looking nice"
1.0,Targeting system was missing from the package - Searched the whole packet carefully just in case it was hiding somewhere but no luck. Disappointing.
1.0,Low quality shirt. I don't like the feel of the fabric - feels like a balloon. Returning.
1.0,"When I got this I really liked the materials, style, fit... but within a day seams around the pockets and sleeves started coming undone. It’s a shame it could have been better made."
1.0,This is NOT merchandise from the series “The Chosen”. It is made to look like it but it is not. The words in the middle of the circle say “the current” NOT The Chosen. Look closely and you will count 13 teal fish NOT 12 - the teal fish used in Chosen merchandise represent the Disciples. Please support The Chosen by only buying authorized merchandise and don’t put money in the pockets of frauds.
1.0,Terrible cut!  I’m a D cup and this top cut me across my chest and the sleeves were too tight.  I let my 12 year old granddaughter wear it and she said it was the most annoying top she’s ever worn.  She’s a B cup and only 4 feet tall.  AWFUL FIT!!
1.0,Really like my French ballet poster not good with measurements. I was really disappointed how small the poster was. I could of printed the picture out for a quarter wasn't worth what I paid for it on Amazon.
1.0,The collars are stretched out none of the four shirts were the same seemed like they were sewn by a blind person!
1.0,Did not fit like all the other size medium PattyBoutiks I own.  Was way too small.  I gave it to a much smaller friend.
1.0,This was about the size of my pinky nail.
1.0,This is not worth the money! It pilled the first time I wore it! Annoying!
1.0,This suitcase is hardly practical and is made of cheap vinyl plastic junk. It's wheels are junk and will hardly make it through a single plane ride. The Ninjago print is a trap for parents and would only serve the purpose of 'pretending' to go somewhere with your suitcase or to throw in the back of the car for a 'trip'.<br />I would not recommend this if you plan on doing any real traveling
1.0,Photo was quite crooked.  Seller acknowledged and offered $5 but I just wanted it made correctly :(
1.0,This shirt is absolute trash.
1.0,They don’t really stay. Hard to place. After about 10 mins it gets painful in your nose
1.0,"The size should of fit but, it was too small. Not true to size!"
1.0,Its cute but when i got it one of the ties on the side was barely hanging on so cant really use it
1.0,"I waited much longer than expected for the heated vest to arrive. It was suppised to be a Christmas gift for my husband. It came way after. The XXL size vest is more like a men's medium size. Not only didn't it fit him after ordering a size larger than he normally wears, it also didn't heat up. I made sure I bought the recommended power bank, which was working properly and was fully charged. I ended up keeping the power bank but returned the vest."
1.0,Broke the first day I got it.  Isnt really worth it . It’s super flimsy .. made cheap.
1.0,Too off
1.0,Literally didn’t work
1.0,Make about 1/4 spin and gets stuck.
1.0,First time wearing it. It did not keep my child dry in the rain. Jacket is slightly damp on the interior. Not warm either.
1.0,"Todo excelente producto, gracias 🙏"
1.0,It just looked ugly
1.0,"Doesn't look like the pictured one at all, don't buy it. True to size"
1.0,"Very cheaply made, irritated my ears"
1.0,"Tore on the first wear, very cheap, waist of money."
1.0,Don't buy this. The Jewelry it self looked so cheap and the ring was HUGE
1.0,Cheap material size off lost out  on 31.00
1.0,"This thing was such a piece of junk it didn't even last 2 days!!!! I thought it would brake i just honestly didnt expect it to be in 2 days (im not hard on my jewelry at all) The piece that holds the loop and the loop itself were SO thin. Serious, like not much bigger then a strand of hair. It wasnt very pretty either, ugly glass and small misshapen red stone. It was also much smaller then in the pictures, they made it out to be a good size when in reality it was about 1/2 an inch tall. Got a refund for me lost pendent and will never order from this company again."
1.0,It tore first time I used it - very cheaply made
1.0,These gloves are not 100% cotton as stated. They stretch and contain an elastic fiber.
1.0,Bought this because I live in a very hot climate. It is not linen or cotton. Fabric doesn’t breathe.
1.0,The chain is not at all what it looks like in the picture. The quality is absolutely horrible.<br />I saw this on Amazon and it looked amazing but it is Nothing that I expected and I’m very unhappy with it.
1.0,Only comes with 1 earing for the left ear.
1.0,The straps are faulty
1.0,"This product is not meant for adult hands. Would fit a child, but not really soft and comfortable at all."
1.0,"I ordered 2 and only received 1. This has been two months I have been waiting for this to be resolved!!! The one I received is awesome. However, not happy about not receiving the other."
1.0,"I wouldn’t recommend buying this, the face mask was itching and I could barely see anything."
1.0,"It immediately hurt my feet as soon as I put it on. But I thought I’d give it a try and after a few usage it’ll be okay. Boy, was I wrong! Both of my big toe hurt like cray. Will have to toss them but sad that it was so expensive. Wish I can get a refund. Sigh."
1.0,Both necklaces are misspelled and are dented and Miss colored on the front there's lumps and dents all over the front and they are misspelled
1.0,the lights don't work because the battery is dead when it was delivered.
1.0,"These are advertised for children but are too large. Seller am only offered a 15% refund and required me to show photo proof that they were too big for my MINOR child. I believe while these “ship from the USA”, they are not made here and the seller is most certainly abroad. Creepy and dishonest."
1.0,extremely unhappy
1.0,This product broke the first time my son tried to use it. Completely broke off into pieces to the point that he couldn’t even use the product.
1.0,"My 1st pair I ordered are 5 stars. I love them they have a curve to them. Their normal thickness of sunglasses. They have gold colored nose things. So I ordered 2 more pair. TO BAD the 2nd set of glasses I ordered are the fake ones people are only giving one star on.  Super thin, Completely straight no curve at all and plastic nose piece things. I'm so bummed. Apparently it's a 50/50 chance if you get the real or fake ones while they make the same amount either way."
1.0,Impossible to connect the end to the opening. Frustrating for my daughter.
1.0,I returned this top as it was not the design that is on the picture. I really wanted the navy-feathered design.
1.0,"I ordered an XL (normally wear a L) based on reviews that this fits small. It fit perfect except for the length, it was abnormally long which I would probably would have dealt with if it wasn't for the quality of the fabric which was most the awful paper-y feeling and completely see through even though it is black. With that type of fabric quality I wouldn't have paid $3 for it."
1.0,Very thin fabric compared to standard canvas. Doesn’t seem very sturdy. Patch is ridiculous.
1.0,The labels are removed!!
1.0,"Size is not as advertised. Its huge. Drags on the floor and I am not short, I am 5'5. Yet in the model photos it reaches the knee and at most, the calf."
1.0,"Sizing is completely wrong, waist and lenght."
1.0,I agree with all other reviews.  Not even worth the $2!!
1.0,Dress was of poor quality very thin material ugh!!
1.0,These were seemingly made of burlap. Sized to a fit a small child. Clearly whoever's created this listing is using an image they found elsewhere to sell this junk.
1.0,"I cannot believe I spent $150 on these. These are my second pair of UGGS. If I wasn't so impressed with the first pair, I wouldn't have ordered another pair when those finally bit the dust. Well.... not only do these not keep my feet warm (like the identical previous pair did)  3 months later  they already have a small tear in them. 3 months. I only started wearing them more regularly when it actually started snowing. The previous pair I had for years before there was any sort of breakdown. I am not impressed nor am I happy. I will try to call the company this next week but I don't expect much."
1.0,Hated these colors
1.0,I just bought this dress and when it came in it was short sleeve and it had a waist line on it. It was thin and see through and looked like a shirt dress. This was not the same dress that was in the picture.  I'm pretty disappointed cause I wanted the long-sleeved version.
1.0,"Cheap nylon and not seems at chest. open chest, no coverage. VERY UGLY. Not as photo'ed. eye sour"
1.0,The post and the pin does not fit. Feels like I bought a piece of junk.
1.0,This was not possibly an XL!
1.0,No support returned it right away. Fit my dd too strangely and big
1.0,I returned them due to not fitting. I can't really comment
1.0,"These socks were a a gift and the giver was embarrassed by them.  When we looked at them, we weren't even sure that they were socks.  They were shapeless and the fabric is just horrible.  They went directly into the garbage - not even suitable for a donation!"
1.0,Most of them came broken ! Was very disappointed. I couldn't leave it at 0 stars was forced to give 1 star
1.0,It is plastic! So disappointed! Don’t waste your money! I wish I could give this 0 stars!
1.0,"I really loved this product when I first received it.  After I washed it, I noticed it is coming apart at the seams.  The return window was so short, that I could not return it.  This item costs too much to be put together so poorly.  So disappointed."
1.0,I purchased these based on so many reviews saying how close they are to OOFOS. I could not be more disappointed. These are horrible. Walmart cheapish would be better. NOTHING like OOFOS. Not even close. They actually HURT my feet! Don't buy these.
1.0,Beware I never received this mask I ordered and I have tried contacting the seller several times and got the same answer it is in transit the tracking number was not a correct number
1.0,It was okay when I saw first
1.0,Wish  I  would  have  read  the  reviews.  They fall apart.  Had to  throw  them  away.
1.0,"The top is waaaaaaaaaay too small....I am a 16, in US sizes, I ordered a XXL....that triangle would only cover a nipple....cute suit though, very well made."
1.0,The watch came with a dead battery.
1.0,VERY small. Bought an XL and it looks like it fits a S/M! The material is SUPER thin and sheer. It also doesnt flare much.
1.0,cheap looking and broke after a week of use
1.0,Disappointed. They otherwise seem fine. I am returning them. :o(
1.0,"Wore these one time for about 4 hours around the house and a had a huge hole rip open in the crotch.  I sized up and got a xxl when a xl would have sufficed, they are incredibly stretchy which I thought was a good thing and wouldn’t warrant the worry of a split open crotchal region.  $18 wasted..."
1.0,While i love the watch (the bracelet broke right away but i was ok with that since i didn't really need that) it now stopped functioning. I don't think it's a battery issue since when i wind it up it starts working for a short time again and then stops. This is really disappointing as it wasn't that cheap of a watch
1.0,"It took almost a month after expected delivery to arrive, the &#34;embroided&#34; 46 is a wash out photocopy of the number 46,  a fade out number, it was a gift for young kid I was ashamed to deliver it , not worth ecen the shipping"
1.0,The size chart is Asian and that too runs small. I ordered a 38 DDD.  The cups on this barely cover a peanut butter cup! The band size is spot on. The cups fit my 17 year old daugther; she wears a B cup.  Sad too because the materials are wonderfully soft with just the right give.  The workmanship is top notch too.<br /><br />I do hope the Asian stores take the time to actually verify their size conversions.
1.0,tarnished and ugly!
1.0,My pants came sowed  crooked🤦🏻‍♀️..:.The letters on the Sweatpants already had the white missing on the leg part on some of the letters. Was not happy wanted them to keep me warm during chemo…and now wasted my money bc I’m sick and can’t return for an exchange 😢
1.0,Horrible quality fabric.. the words on the hoodie are already cracked and coming off. DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1.0,"After 1 washing,  with cold water, shirts shrunk almost 2 sizes."
1.0,Heeeeeavy
1.0,"The top of this hat sits way to high, and the embroidery caused it to look misshapen"
1.0,This product did not meet the sizing chart. I even ordered one size smaller than what the sizing chart said. It was twice my size
1.0,"I bought this because the plastic spray bottles tend to melt if left in my car, and I like the more durable aluminum spray bottle when I toss in a bike bag or waistpack. Within a month bottle is really dented up in a couple places, however it certainly does serve its purpose. I bought for twelve dollars and considered buying a second one, however at twenty dollars three months later this is definitely overpriced for what you get.  I don't want or need the case, so pretty expensive for a 1oz aluminum spray bottle. No thanks.<br /><br />Update 2019 - can't unscrew the top and refill the aluminum bottle with lens cleaning fluid when bottle is empty - dropping rating to 1 star since the aluminum bottle was the whole reason why I bought the kit."
1.0,"The shoe fits super awkward and no amount of insole or thick socks could help. The space between the top of my foot and where it hits my ankle was weird and these are more than just ""over the knee"" on me. I'm 5'6 and these almost hit my butt with how high up they go, plus they barely fit over my thighs and I'm 130lbs, size 7. There's a reason these shoes are so cheap"
1.0,Crappy boots. The soles were so dking thin that even stepping on a very small rock was fking painful. In theory three should have been great but in real life they suck
1.0,Washed them in cold water and hung them to dry. Shrank and obscene amount. Literally turned into capris. Unwearable.
1.0,"These pants fit nicely, but after the first wash I put them on and noticed they were coming apart on the hip and inner thigh. I'll remove this review if I'm able to return."
1.0,Bizarre fit. The top is so ridiculously short that the elastic barely goes below my average/small sized chest. I feel guilty donating this. It's so horrid.
1.0,Costume wouldn’t stay inflated nor inflate all the way and was not usable.
1.0,"I have bought these leggings before BUT in BLACK but when I chose this color, I realize that the design is not the same and the size is bigger than the black leggings. I felt betrayed. The same thing applies to the navy leggings - the size and design do not correspond with the black leggings. The black leggings and the the Camo have a perfect fit and design"
1.0,Awful!!!!!  Nothing like the picture! Disappointed!!!!
1.0,"Ordered a set of two bands and one of the bands seems to be defective.<br />Something is wrong with both the clasps, they are loosely connected when attached to the fitbit, very easy to wiggle and they leave a space between the fitbit and the strap. One of two clasps releases from the fitbit with a small amount of force. Just grazing your fitbit against something is enough for the strap to fall off sometimes.<br />Hard to wear if you plan to do any activity that might graze your wrists."
1.0,THe grey pig was broken.  The loops just feel out
1.0,"Es tamaño Plus sólo de ancho,  pero de manga es un tamaño regular."
1.0,I received these yesterday and was very disappointed with them they didn't have the little back peice on them and the stud on the back of one was broken off.
1.0,"Very poor build quality.<br /><br />The demagnetizer arrived in new condition, but it was functionally inoperable. Closer inspection showed that the already-sketchy-looking push-button power switch had completely failed, which prevented the device from turning on. I opened it up to see if I could fix it, and I almost wished I hadn't. The shoddy internal construction was horrifying and potentially unsafe. I certainly wouldn't recommend leaving it plugged in any longer than absolutely necessary."
1.0,When I received the purse it was not what I expected. It is only $6 because the material is horrible! Not what I expected...not happy at all!
1.0,The hinge and clamp was not straight with the lenses so the lenses sit at an angle to my glasses.
1.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter. She needed a ball gown for a school play, Cinderella, she was in. She tried it on once before her play to make sure it fit right.  Unfortunately, the zipper piece fell off after she tried it on before her play. So I watched her dance around the stage during the performance with the entire back of her dress unzipped. I looked at the zipper afterwards and found that the little handle fell right off of it.<br /><br />What a wast of my money!!<br /><br />I’m not skilled with sewing at all. I can see that the zipper needs to be replaced, but I’m not able to do that. So this perfectly good dress that was literally worn once is ruined.  Very disappointed, I’d give 0 stars if I could."
1.0,"Bought these for a beach trip. Glasses broke on both sides within 2 days, making the lens fall out. Waste of my money."
1.0,Didn't seem to do anything
1.0,Terrible product. Spring has no tension.  No point in using these.
1.0,"The color of this item was horrible dark ""puke"" green...I bought it for my daughter and its ugly! I bought the matching earrings and they were beautiful....these were so so so disappointing!"
1.0,"I'm 5'6"", 150lbs, 34B, and am usually a medium. I purchased this in a medium and it fit true to size. HOWEVER, it was extremely long (I had to hem it 3 inches shorter), it was ridiculously large in the underarm area (looked like sails of extra fabric flapping at my sides), and the fabric is insanely thin and see-through (I was wearing a nude bra and you could see ALL of it- I am not well endowed so it wasn't like my boobs were stretching the fabric or anything). Use your money elsewhere."
1.0,"The fabric has a strange blue hue to it. If you’re looking for a pure white dress, this is not the one. Processing return."
1.0,"The blouse was ugly,looks nothing like the picture 😒"
1.0,"The gloves were advertised as NEW, and they arrived scratched. Some parts even look like they have been cut with a cutter... They look as though they had already been worn at least two seasons.<br /><br />Don't buy this product."
1.0,The quality is bad - bows keeps falling off on their own . I have to tie them . Looks very cheap .
1.0,Fits perfect in foot but can’t zip it up all the way..
1.0,pictures are totally misleading. image shows that mask is contoured over the nose but it isn't
1.0,"I love the way they look, but they turned my ears green. :/"
1.0,Very pretty but the hinge broke already... Disappointed it didn't last longer.
1.0,the fabric is too thin to drape well in a tunic. it is see through it is so thin! sent it back right away!
1.0,"Did not send anything to return the dress, not even a return address. Runs too large! Normally I am a size 2, I got a small and it is like a garbage bag on me. Also goes pass my knee, I am 5'2. Material is nice though."
1.0,The short length is not at all as shown...
1.0,I bought this for a lightweight vest to wear when I go for walks.  The fit was to tight. My Size M fit like a S or XS.  When I tried to return. Shipping would have cost more than what I paid for it.
1.0,Broke withing a few months.
1.0,"WORST MATERIAL EVER, looks nothing like the picture... the holes are cut with sisscors it looks so bad."
1.0,NOT WHITE!!!! it's a CREAM color I returned it....
1.0,This was incredibly small! Ridiculous!
1.0,"08/20/20 Update -<br />So I sent this watch in for warranty service (IWC) per Invicta's instructions after they charged me $30 for processing and inspection. Then about a week later send me an Invoice for $207 to repair the watch that FAILED UNDER WARRANTY. Amazon made it right and is refund/returning the watch. I will Never buy from Invicta Again.<br /><br />This watch is gorgeous, abosolutely knew I had to have it once I seen it. Perfect size for my larger wrist and not ridiculiously heavy.<br /><br />This watch unfortunately doesnt live upto the ""Invicta"" quality claim and somehow got water past the seals. Yes the crown was completely screwed down, I was only swimming in a 3' pool for approximately 30mins. Clearly not ""Professional 200 meter"" rated.<br /><br />For as much as I paid for this watch, Only having it a little over 2 months, I would love to see the company send a replacement. This is the 4th Invicta and will most definitely be the last if not resolved."
1.0,Ordered these because they looked small and petite but when they arrived they where twice as big as the photograph showed
1.0,Rolls down!
1.0,Break your face out & so cheap strings pop as you placing on your ear
1.0,My husband was so excited about these and they broke into 3 pieces the first time he jumped in the water with them.
1.0,Do not buy these.  Not well made and them hem started coming out right away
1.0,"This is a very tiny bracelet, more appropriate for a teenager.  Metal is thin and quality is poor.  Do not recommend!"
1.0,Super cute butts buttons would not stay buttons holes were too big.
1.0,"I DO NOT know how this product is rated as high as it is. The tutu is the crunchiest, stiffest piece of junk I've ever felt!!! The color is significantly off compared to the ""ballet pink"" we are used to from our Mirella brand ones. This one is a brighter pink. The sizing is off as well. Measured our daughter according to each of the categories listed in the last photo of their listing and chose the medium. This is a whole size off. There was an extra inch in the torso and the dip in the back was too low cut for a little girl. Incredibly disappointed all the way around. Should've know better and stuck with a high quality dance brand instead. Dropping off for a return tomorrow morning."
1.0,Maybe for a little girl
1.0,The material and dress do not look like the picture.
1.0,"I loved the print when I came across it on amazon.. so sad to have received a CHILD SIZE baking apron. When I tried adjusting the strap around the neck, it came loose while i was baking. It is too uncomfortable to wear..."
1.0,"This is a case where the photo is definitely not a reflection of the actual product. I am 5'3, 110 lbs and ordered the size small in the color off-white. The most disappointing fact is that the dress is completely sheer, so you would not even be able to wear it by itself. I think any other color other than the off-white would be a better choice based on other reviewers' photos. It was very awkward and frumpy on, and even tying the waist wrap as tight as possible it still was slouchy. It was a little too long in the front, but the length in the back was perfect. Compared to the photos, it looks a lot cheaper than I was expecting, especially considering that it is almost $24. I had high hopes for this dress but it looks like I will be returning it ):"
1.0,"I received the set and was shocked to see that the thread used to sew the (inside) of this RED garment is bright WHITE. I had hoped that it would not be seen when wearing - after all, why would they ship it if would be visible? Unfortunately, the WHITE stitching can be seen through the lace when you are wearing it. I've taken pictures of the inside and outside so you can see for yourself.  Now the shorts have an additional problem. These pajamas are size medium and the waist is only 23&#34; that is suppose to stretch to 29&#34; according to their sizing chart. OMG the shorts feel like they are going to cut off my circulation! Horrible purchase all around! I would give it 0 stars but the system does not allow it."
1.0,Extremely small even though I ordered an large
1.0,"is not smoke - is grey with lavender lens, look really cheap - very disappointed :("
1.0,Broke as soon as my daughter put it on for the first time.
1.0,"Had the belt for a week.  It buckle broke.  I wear belts loose, so not a lot of stress on the buckle.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"I only got 4 birthstones and none of them are the months I need.  This is a Christmas gift to my daughter who jyst became an aunt, not happy."
1.0,"After reading other reviews, I ordered down a size, bad idea. The dress is cute but the colors were much more saturated compared to the photo. i ordered the green. I wanted softer colors. The fabric has a sheen to it when stretched.<br />I'm 5'3 and ordered the medium, Length was fine. Will be ordering next size up and a different color."
1.0,Wasnt great material
1.0,The shirt was made very poorly- it's see through and isn't even on both sides from the neck to the shoulder so it pulls to one side/ lays crooked and can't be worn
1.0,No matter what size I order they all end up being a men's medium even if you order an XXL. Never again will I buy something g from here. Which is awful because the quality and designs are awesome.
1.0,too small and cheaply made
1.0,Don’t waste your money The letters are too big for the mask so you can’t really see what the mask is saying. I work for DoorDash on the weekends and they gave me one of theirs for free perfect but this one I don’t recommend
1.0,Bother broke within a week
1.0,Aggravated beyond redemption!!! These were for my granddaughter 's prom and one of them fell apart while she was getting ready with no time to get something else.
1.0,"Material wrinkles, they won’t come out.  Sorry I bought."
1.0,"This dress was aweful.  I don't even know how to explain how unhappy I was.  You litterly could not tie this as the ties were in the wrong place, it was like a see through robe.  I definitely do not reccomend."
1.0,I bought this a few weeks ago and one of the wings has already broken off.
1.0,"No description of the size of the earring, width"
1.0,The jewels fell off after wearing for 5 minutes. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,"I usually like stainless steel jewelry because it does not turn my skin green but these did! They are nice looking, but not worth it to turn green in my opinion."
1.0,"I very much love this watch, however; after having the pleasure of this watch for only 2 months the clasp that holds watch on my wrist broke. This watch is still under warranty and the company does not want to fix it, replace it NOTHING. I do NOT recommend this company at all. I have diffently changed my opinion of this company."
1.0,Stone is loose and rattled when worn
1.0,At first they look very nice! They are cheaply made and turn color fast...like used once fast! =( Do not waste your money!
1.0,Extra sticky and didn’t really support my breast’s.
1.0,The bonnet ripped from me just trying it on! Garbage.
1.0,So cheap! Color changed after wearing for one day. Extremely light weight. Will never purchase again
1.0,"This garment needs to be taken off the market and the sizing issue solved.  In your place, I would be embarrassed to ship this out to anyone.  I ordered a size large...Supposedly equivalent to a U S size 12/14. WRONG.  I am size 12.  This garment is a size 6 or maybe 8.  Certainly not a 12.  If you are selling to the U S market, you need to grade it for the U S woman. Being returned immediately."
1.0,I wanted to like this product but I can barely wear it for more than 5 minutes. The hard frame and tightness around the nose makes it unbearable for long term use.  Opt for a different pair!
1.0,"The idea is good, the cut is ok. The keyhole part is a little off and the material is really bad. It wrinkles badly."
1.0,Runs a little small and the pocket was too far toward the center of the shirt. It looked really off. Sent it back.
1.0,Very unflattering to wear.
1.0,"The skirt is puffy.  It says slim line in the advertisement but it does not sit in a slim manner, it puffs out like a little toddler’s pretend Cinderella puffy skirt.  Ok maybe not that puffy, but close enough.  Looked silly on me.  Returned."
1.0,Nothing like image<br />Looks very dull
1.0,"the gems started popping out on the first day... very cheaply made, piece of junk jewelry. I will never waste my money on this again!!"
1.0,I wear Nike all the time and this is NOT Nike.<br />It’s too small in size and the fabric is too thin and transparent.
1.0,"These glasses are not polarized, even though they look to have a coating on the lens. You can check this by placing them in between you and a LCD computer screen, then rotating. At certain angles if the lenses are polarized they will not allow light (or become black in appearance) to pass through the lens. I can confirm as others have noted the frame is not uniform one side is slightly deformed. The plastic frame also was cracked upon arrival, there was no damage to the box or the packaging when it arrived so I am unsure if this is a defect or just my personal luck. I specifically gave these 1 star due to the fact they are not polarized."
1.0,Material is very chintzy.
1.0,Very poor quality and pretty see thru.
1.0,Weird fit. too loose in places. Horrible narrow elastic band at the top of the fabric waist band.
1.0,"I purchased this item for my daughter. It fit well however after 5 days the silver body of the she started to separate from the rubber bottom. We requested another pair, they sent it to us very fast. In a matter of 48 to 72 hours. But after 2 days the same thing started to happen once more. The adhesive is weak and not made for kid use. My daughter did not even use the rollers on them for skating she just wore them to school once. I do not recommend the silver pair. My other daughter has the pink so far they are not showing the same poor craftsmanship."
1.0,I like my shirts bigger to allow for unrestricted movement ... I ordered a 5x for that reason ... it is way too tight ... very disappointed
1.0,Seriously. Way Way to small and delivery takes over month. Don't waist your money.
1.0,"I ordered this in black, size Large which fit great on my 5'10, medium build frame. However, I'm returning it because it was super see-through. Too see-through for my taste. The dress would be great if I were using it strictly as a bathing suit cover, but I'm hoping to wear it out -- family gatherings, BBQ's, weekend trips, etc, and I'm not sure I need the world knowing what my under garments look like. I also wasn't a fan of the pockets, which protrude out at the hips, like others have mentioned, and even more so then the picture. I wanted to like this, but it's not for me."
1.0,"I ordered a 4T  for my grandson, and when it finally arrived it was considerably larger than a standard 4T for toddlers. It is marked 4T, but it is closer to an adult small.  Don’t when he’ll be able to wear it."
1.0,Don't  buy these! They are all product/endorsing masks. They are of decent fabric and they fit nicely. BUT don't waste your time or money. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Dress 1 - Emerald green (that has a satin-type fabric for the bodice and a tulle-type fabric for the skirt). This dress originally caught my eye because of its beautiful color, flattering shape, and beautiful fabric. I scoured reviews to determine whether or not it was worth taking a chance on and, if it was, what size I should get. I knew it was a long shot, but I tried it. I'm 5'6 and about 148 lbs (very curvy). I ordered a small, and the waist and skirt fit beautifully! BUT, the bodice was a nightmare... firstly, the fabric was thinner than a piece of regular paper. I would have suggested wearing nipple petals, but those would show too. I have honestly never seen such a thin fabric, but I would have been willing to try remedying it if it weren't for the strange cut. The bodice looks nothing like it does on the model. The front of the sides (on the outside of your boobs) curve too far inward, making the fit very bizarre (another user posted a photo of this, and it was exactly the same for me). It was really strange and there was no way to make it work (short of basically reconstructing the entire bodice, which I did consider, but since it was $33 for just the skirt it didn't make sense).<br /><br />Dress 2 - pale pink with tulle-type fabric all over. This had a much more normal fit, but was still enough was wrong that I couldn't make it work. I got a medium on this one based on reviews. I think it might have worked better if I had a small, but I couldn't wait until it came back in stock on April 9th. The fabric was beautiful, it was in good shape, but the bodice just had too much space (and if you tighten the straps enough it makes the back fit very weird). This *might* work for some people, but it's kind of hit or miss and will vary based on your size and shape. It's worth a try because *IF* it does work you can't beat $27 for a beautiful dress like this."
1.0,I ordered a medium and the waist band is deathly tight. I typically wear a size 4 pants and if the waistband wasn’t so tight it would fit perfectly.
1.0,Brand new out of the box and already has a hole in it.
1.0,It broke within 5 minutes.  Very cheaply made.  I don't recommend.
1.0,"The Good: Solid appearance, low price. No discoloration (skin or jewelry) with exposure to skincare/beauty routine. Initially experienced no redness, irritation nor weeping during short term wear.<br /><br />The Bad: Flawed, risky and potentially unsafe and (at a minimum) unhygienic closure design.<br /><br />The Ugly: Redness, irritation, inflammation and  weeping following long term wear. Difficult to insert/remove, can’t even begin to fathom the hassle of short term wear.<br /><br />Body Piercing 101: The jewelry Post should always be male. A solid, threaded construct, by design, enables the Post to pass smoothly thru the piercing canal without snagging, tearing or abrading the interior walls.

1.0,The quality and material is really bad. My mom bought it in a hurry and just decided it was not worth it to return.
1.0,The dress fit as expected (I'm size 14/16 and ordered XL) but the vest was ripped down the back. If the vest was in tack it would have been way too tight.
1.0,I gave it 1 star only for quality.  It took waaaay too long to receive it only to find out it was ridiculously too small! I will never shop international again!
1.0,"This item runs about 3 times larger than the ordered size. The quality is that of a very stiff t-shirt material. The photo, like most of the allegra k products, are very deceiving."
1.0,"This is big, bulky, gawdy, awful, and ugly! It looks like a ten cent item from a gumball machine! I do not recommend wasting your money!"
1.0,this was cheaply made with odd seams. returned it to buy omeya version with long sleeves
1.0,"I have seen dogs with mange that shed less.  Everywhere I go there are little black &#34;lashes&#34; left behind. I tried using a lint roller to stop the shedding.  10 pieces of tape later and half of the roller gone I gave up.<br /><br />I typically do not write recommendation, but I have never purchased an item from Amazon of such horrendous quality!"
1.0,"Average quality, but obviously meant for Lilliputians.  Arm length, shoulder width way too small.  I gave it to my (tiny) dsughter-in-law."
1.0,The shoes arrived and were filthy. I am very disappointed. I had to clean the area between the fabric and the soles with alcohol right out of the packaging. They looked as though they'd already been worn.....several times. The only reason that I didn't return them is because the soles didn't show any wear and my daughter really wanted them. The first picture is how they arrived. The 2nd picture is after I cleaned them with alcohol.
1.0,Cheaply made and undersized.
1.0,"This is a terrible product, and other items ordered from same seller just as bad-Amazon should ban them from selling on their website to protect customers.... colors are different, fabric is different, shape is nothing like photo, quality- worth less than a dollar- very very cheaply produced- protect yourself- run from this supplier- do not buy!"
1.0,The order never came in.  I am hoping it is on the way.  It did have a long lead time when I ordered it.
1.0,Inexpensive and wouldn’t stay on.  A waste of time.
1.0,Just received an used dress with stain and frayed fabrics.
1.0,The first time I washed them the elastic came apart on one of the socks. I wrote to seller to return them but haven't heard from them. I now want a refund. I bought them for a month long road trip so missed the date for refund. I returned home after the return date so spent $ on a disposeable pair of stockings! Do not buy. They fall apart when washed.
1.0,I had this purse for exactly 3 months and the zipper broke. Should have listened to the other reviews. Very unhappy.
1.0,came as a size for a doll
1.0,When I got the they were so nice but 3 days later they turned black like tarnished so not good at all
1.0,One of the three broke just putting it on and it was loose! What a waste of money. They look nothing like the photo. Very cheaply made. Don't waste your money
1.0,Wallmart has these for 4$
1.0,Broke first time i wore it.
1.0,Useless.  they were sent back. Don't waste your money.
1.0,not good qualit :/
1.0,I did not like this dress at all and sending it back. It is way longer than pictured and does not have the cute baggie look as pictured.
1.0,They are so cute but don’t stay in place. They are too heavy and they fall off from the uneven weight :(
1.0,Within just a few weeks the silver is all but gone and a bronze-orange metal remains.  I am not impressed.
1.0,after tow months of using the bag looks torn &rubbed<br /> the company dosn't giving any service for this bag!!!<br />thx
1.0,This dress is not true to USA size!! I normally wear a 14 comfortably. I could not even pull the dress down below my thighs.
1.0,FAKE!!!
1.0,Sweater was thinner and shinier than advertised. wore baggier than I wanted as well
1.0,Me decepcionó bastante esta bolsa 😒
1.0,"I sent it back, not for my body figure"
1.0,They were WAY shorter than I expected. Couldn't be worn.
1.0,This bracelet arrived damaged.
1.0,I got the smallest size and they are way too big.
1.0,No size chart available from seller. Be sure to order one or two sizes bidder. Going to return it.
1.0,"The top i ok, the bottom is not wearable. Out of form, no straight line, wayyy to big for a small. Bad quality"
1.0,Don't get this. I have one star because that's the lowest it will let you. Nothing like the picture-very awkward fitting and not a true cue oversized look.
1.0,I used the largest suitcase for the first time this weekend (8-5-17) and while walking down the stairs of my house to leave for my trip the side handle broke. After the trip while leaving the hotel and placing my suitcase back into my trunk the top handle broke. It's summer time I don't have any heavy clothes or items in the suitcase. There was no reason for the handles to snap off that easily just from carrying. The suitcase for a couple seconds.<br />I do NOT recommend buying this garbage.<br />This was a complete waste of money.
1.0,Looks nothing like shirt ordered. Terrible cheap quality. Such a shame.
1.0,Apears to be flimsy.
1.0,DON’T WAIST YOUR MONEY! Witches hats are fine. But the bat’s are a waist of money. They didn’t even use a entire sheet of paper to make 12 Bat’s. They are so tiny. Bad purchase!
1.0,Was really counting on this to fit but the large looks so tiny like a small.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1b41512183b9b2e4848df6b66e93750d]] El producto vino podrido
1.0,Sweatshirts shrunk so bad can no longer wear.
1.0,** DRESS IS NOT WHAT IS PICTURED ** this dress is not even remotely similar to as its pictured. It is a different pattern not even tie dye & it fits like a damn MOO MOO I wish I could give it negative 5 stars -
1.0,"I should’ve known better than to have ordered the last pair, these were obviously tried on and worn before🙁"
1.0,"I received the necklace, without the message. The point of me ordering the necklace is for the message as well. The packaging was tacky! I was embarrassed to give this gift to my daughter. This was a waste of money!"
1.0,It's a pretty wallet however I've had haven't had it very long and it's torn up already and I don't have that much in it so it's past the window for exchange or return but I would not order this or suggest it
1.0,Not at all as pictured. I have never given anything a bad review and honestly it would be perfect for a small B or A cup but for me I'm 36C and this didn't work for me at all not enough coverage I won't be able to wear it at all
1.0,We returned these due to one earring arriving broken.  :(
1.0,The lens distort the vision. You can only see the image through the center of the lens. The outer parts are completely out of focus. In order to read a page you cannot move your eyes from top to bottom. Instead you have to keep your eyes on the center of the lens and move your face up and down. After a few minutes you end up with a big headache.
1.0,"Looking at the picture this looks to be lime green or close and white, it is closer to an olive green and grey.  Had I known it was this much darker I would not have bought. It is a deceptive picture."
1.0,Quality is not what you would expect. It had scratches and damage on the surface - returned
1.0,Unable to get a replacement or credit. The garment came with a snag in the back and because of the waffle texture of the fabric the snag will run when washed. So predicting a centimeter long vertical tear after the shirt comes out of the laundry.
1.0,"I was very unimpressed with these bows. When I took one out of the package I noticed the back of the bow where it's glued to the headband it was very rough and scratchy, and I knew my daughter would be uncomfortable wearing them. I went to JoAnn's and bought felt and cut out small pieces and glued them on the back of every bow so it wouldn't scratch my daughters head when she wore them. This helped with that problem, but one of the first times my daughter was wearing one of the bows, she pulled it off her head (like babies often do) and the bow fell apart! I'm so frustrated with these bows."
1.0,If I had seen when ordering that this was coming from another country I would not have purchase this!!!!!
1.0,Ordered the orange belt. What came in the mail was not orange. I just want the orange belt advertised... :'(
1.0,"I ordered a small and the pants is either a large or extra large. It is as though they put the wrong  size on the wrong pants. Just by looking at it, it is obvious that the pants is no where near a small. Extremely too big not just by a little but by lot. I was disappointed because I ordered it to have for something and didn’t have it as I intended to. They worked with me though and told me to keep the pant and reimbursed me. I will donate the pants to the homeless because I can’t wear them. I appreciate them not giving me a hard time settling this matter. Thank you"
1.0,"Cheap material and many long threads all over. Fit too large, I retuned it."
1.0,"Poor quality, is in the trash now"
1.0,"Disappointed, crooked and you can’t even see.."
1.0,I can't believe i didn't see that in the picture. I can't give that away as a present. Nice color. Too large. Just save your $30 and go to the pawn shop.
1.0,Way too smal.
1.0,I bought this shirt thinking it would be great for a Christmas party and while it fits but fabric around the chest is not like the picture showed. I had to pull it this way pull it that way and tuck just to get it to look like the picture only for me to move and I had to start all over again to fix it.
1.0,honestly marked it as one star because it won't let me post otherwise.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money. They aren't gym pants. Sooooo thin and not even worth putting on. You can see right through them and small was HUGE. I also don't remember seeing anything about them being high waisted in the description. But maybe I'm wrong.
1.0,Definitely not as mentioned in the description.. they don’t stretch at all. They’re more for kids feet not adults.. highly disappointed.. not your typical one size fits all..
1.0,"This was a cute shirt and I got lots of compliments on it. But then, on the FIRST day of wearing it, I got a rip in it from just wearing it. It was loose on me like it is on the model (I'm not at all model-like, though) and the rip just developed naturally on the sleeve near my armpit - no crazy stretching or anything. Not happy. Must be cheap fabric..."
1.0,"Print design comes right off, poor quality"
1.0,"Stone fell out 2 days after wearing, contacted seller and told that due to humidity (like taking a shower) that it wasn't suitable for the glue and I should try something sturdier.... Why would you use such terrible glue for a product that clearly is left in the wearers face 24/7? I have paid the same price for a multipack of studs from Claire's that lasted months over this product. Obviously people shower with facial piercings.. will not be purchasing  from this seller again."
1.0,"Earrings were beautiful. Unfortunately, I couldn't wear them because they weren't secure"
1.0,"This didnt look anything like the picture and so cheap, waste of money."
1.0,It's very tarnished looking and stones are misglued. Quite ugly and not like the picture
1.0,I used this product for the first time this week. The bags are not good quality. They are torn already just from closing the bags.
1.0,"Unflattering, uncomfortable, and cheap looking-- returned immediately."
1.0,"We order fleece lined jeans from other vendors quite often because we are working outside on our farm. These are the first lined jeans we have ever encountered that has the thinnest, most useless lining we’ve ever seen! Perhaps they will work for temperatures in mid spring but they will not help, even with long johns, in extremely cold temperatures. In addition, the fit simply isn’t right. My husband has a consistent 31x30 with ‘wiggle-room’ for larger or smaller. These jeans seem to be ‘irregular’ in fit."
1.0,Title says slim-fit but once you go into it there’s no further mention of it; Compared size dimensions and they are exactly the same. Very poor specifications
1.0,"2nd one I got, zipper on pockets break EASY"
1.0,This product wasn't reflective of USA sizes at all. I was out of town and by the time I got back and tried it on it was to late to return - I got rid of it.
1.0,"It is extremely frustrating when you receive an order, it is defective, and there is NOWHERE for you to reach out to the seller.<br /><br />I received this in the mail yesterday and it has a huge gaping hole in it where there should be a stone.<br />You can literally see RIGHT THROUGH the ring.<br />It looks incredibly stupid and is sad that it is so cheap.<br />I'd like a refund but there is nowhere to reach out to the seller."
1.0,I did not like this face covering. It’s hard to breathe through this fabric. It just didn’t work with long hair and glasses.
1.0,"They were super cute but didn't even last 6 hours, they started to run with nothing external effecting it.<br />Wish they were made better. Sucks I only got one use (not even) out of them."
1.0,The bracelet ms would not stay closed.  As the day went on they would eventually nearly fall off of my arm.
1.0,"The lead wires come separated from the lead tips the first time you bend them exposing the wire inside...BOTH!, git lit up on 460 volts the first day I had them."
1.0,Not very comfortable not what I expected from a Nike product
1.0,"I'm so conflicted! I loved this bracelet. I am very cheep when it comes to jewelry, so the $55 price tag was way more than I would pay for anything that is not stamped. This material isn't. But that didn't matter because the concept and design are exactly my taste. But alas, inside of a month it snapped in two. I am pretty heartbroken, but I won't be buying it again. The care instructions say not to get it wet, so I removed it to shower and wash my hands, and that's all it took for the material to break, and I didn't even ware it every day :(<br />If you purchase this item be sure to wear is sparingly, like once, maybe twice and then never again."
1.0,"I love this dress in the picture and I read all the reviews before ordering. I can do a small or a medium, depending on the fit. I decided to order a medium but even had a I ordered a small, this still wouldn't have worked. The top sides gape open no matter how tight you tie it. The crochet portion doesn't lay against your skin and it just doesn't look right hanging wide open. I wanted to love this dress, but it wasn't for me."
1.0,"This was awful!! The length is past the knee and it is totally see through. Great price, but it was very obvious why it was so cheap."
1.0,Broke 2 days later. Not worth it
1.0,Dress had holes in it and pink stains
1.0,Boot size is an 8 so that's what I ordered...and the ones I received  where WAY too small.. they fit more like a 7..can't even wear em
1.0,These glasses seem cheaply made. They do not fit well over your glasses. Cheap plastic.

1.0,"I ordered the all purple.  What i got was purple with white trim,  fine i can handle that.  What i cannot handle is the terrible chemical smell.  Will return"
1.0,"We ended up returning this. The shirt fit alright, but the shorts were massive and the blues were totally different shades! Horrible quality"
1.0,"Beautiful in the picture, but not very good quality.  These lasted a week, oh well"

1.0,This is a very cheap product. The shirt feels thread bear and the button feel likw they are going to pop off. Do not waste your money.
1.0,The reviews said to order a size up so I did...still absolutely tiny and the material is so cheap that it ripped like tissue paper as soon as I tried to pull it over my head.
1.0,I read the reviews and thought I would try this anyway-don't do it!!!!!!! This shirt is crap. it is not like the picture. it is made of some weird material.DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Nice dress but size run 2 sizes to small
1.0,Very fragile cheap plastic for high price<br />Easy to break bad quality
1.0,"The reviews were misleading regarding size because I personally think the sizing was as their guide provided, , but they were dead on with the flimsy material.  While trying this blouse on, I probably should have taken extra care pulling my arms through the sleeves because that's where it gave.  But then again, I put it on the same way I do any other blouse.  Anyway, I ended up with a rip along the seam in such a way that I can't mend it."
1.0,Looks cheap. Very thin
1.0,This is the worst mistake i made when buying this doesn't look like picture i eas so upset
1.0,Not polarized lenses. These look like cheap knock-offs. I am returning them.
1.0,I bought a black and champagne handbag back in January.  I saved the champagne one for the summer and only started using it in July.  Yesterday I noticed that the stitching holding the handle in place was just about to come off (pic attached) and the handle on the other side (the material is starting to rip).  Well this didn't last long - 3 months.  Very disappointed as I really liked this handbag.  Guess I better check out the black one that I used from Feb through June and see if the same thing is happening with that one.  3 months is not worth the price.
1.0,Ugly and awkward. Would not recommend.
1.0,Gave the product away it didn't fit
1.0,"These earrings are so bad—please do not buy as I went to open the set, immediately the ball came of the stud!! What a waste of money..attaching a picture ;( VERY CHEAP!!"
1.0,No where did it say or indicate in photos that the part of the top that covers your tummy is sheer! Returning!!
1.0,"Updated to add: yesterday I tried these on and loved them so much but today I put them on, hadn’t yet washed, hadn’t done anything, and the leggings busted in the thigh before I even pulled them up all the way. Bummer.<br /><br />I love how high waisted these are! I’m super short waisted - I mean my waist curves in almost right under my bust - and these came up without giving me “the toe” I want every color"
1.0,I wanted a white golf dress & the front looks great but did not like the back.  So returned it.  Loved that it had pockets.

1.0,"I bought these sandals in July and wore them about five times before the right back side of the shoe broke…<br />I liked the style a lot, they were cute looking with the jute platform and they are comfortable. They definitely get a five star for comfort and style!<br />But don’t expect them to last more than a month or more than a few wears, you can even see in the pictures they are almost brand new. Sadly, I don’t recommend them at all!<br />Worst thing is, August the 10th was the closing date for returns…"
1.0,I went to put it on and the clasp came off. Never even got to wear it.
1.0,"I received this 3.5 months after I ordered it. It is small, cheaply made and substandard. It most refinery is NOT worth $24.00. I have received things from WISH better made than this. Also I want to return it and the return time has lapsed. How can that be when I only received it today."
1.0,My dog broke through this chain within one day. PIECE OF CRAP. Buyer beware!
1.0,This is absolute cheating. There is no dinosaur. It’s just a pair of inflated pants and a small alligator on the back biting the butt. It’s not what the description says or the picture shown. Very disappointed
1.0,I knew when it was delivered in a small plastic package I was going to be disappointed.. when I opened it I said what is this?  first it is super thin second from the look of the cut on the bottom it would seem someone hand cut pieces of the cheap material without their glasses on.. I would go on but I will not the headline says enough....
1.0,Item recieved was not Mueller brand. A very poor version branded Youper.

1.0,Much shorter than expected the holes for the thumbs are at my forearm and the ties to tie it are not with the dress so there are just empty loop holes. Cheap thin see through clingy fabric . Very disappointed quite frankly
1.0,socks do not stay on
1.0,"The measurements for this fail to indicate hip measurement. While the waist measurement may fit, this is not wide enough across the hips to be able to pull on."

1.0,"I've been having really bad pain due to carpel tunnel and effecting my hands pretty bad too.  Both sides, on the side of my pinky finger as well as my thumb due to too many hours on the computer. These gloves gave me no relief at all, did not provide the compression needed.  Ended up buying a brace that kept enough pressure on my hands and wrist.  Not sure what the copper fibers were supposed to do but nevertheless, didn't do anything and was annoying while driving due to the lines on the palm"
1.0,Returning it.  Even if it fit it was see through even though it was black with flowers.  I would never wear this.
1.0,Cool looking but clasp is SUPER CHEAP! Wore maybe 5 times and broke!!
1.0,"It definitely is a THIN cardigan, they should take out the “coat” part of the description."
1.0,The quality of the materials feel very cheap and the construction is poor. The fuzzy lining is only on the back and front sides and is missing a bottom seam. The hood is lined with a different fabric and really thin and the arms are not lined at all. What they call corduroy feels like thin weird paper.
1.0,Felt cheap returned
1.0,I put my car key and it keep falling. Doesn’t work at all. I will exchange for a different one
1.0,Only two we're rhinestone. Two we're backs. Two were straight silver ball studs without screw back.
1.0,"Terrible quality. My daughter, literally has only worn these socks 3 times and there are already holes in them."
1.0,"The photo looked great. Took about 3 weeks to arrive. I ordered a men's XL, I received a XXL, the size is actually about a men's medium.  It fits my wife, but the button hole is size is far too small so you can't even button it!<br /><br />***You have to return it to CANADA, and you pay the return shipping of about $28.  Just a ripoff seller.***"
1.0,The sun glasses are cheap and flimsy. They feel like a pair of 3-D movie glasses you receive at the theatre.
1.0,These might be worth $10 maybe $15 on a good day.
1.0,I got broken one. The glass near the butterfly was broken.
1.0,This dress was awful. When you raise your arms the whole dress comes up. Super tight.
1.0,This swimsuit was bulky and heavy. It had way to much fabric.
1.0,It’s way smaller than expected so buy bigger then your size
1.0,The other reviews are so good I’m very disappointed. Cheap material and you have to get extensions because they are way too small.
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture!!!! Looks like a mangled fortune cookie w a stripe of sloppy Teal paint. And, you have to pay to return!!! What a waste of $$$$... trying to figure out how to upcycle."
1.0,This item is cheaply made and I was very<br />Disappointed
1.0,It was cheaply made..and one size doesn't fit all..I ordered what my normal size was ...it was huge
1.0,watch stopped working not a deal would like to return it
1.0,Stones were broken and loose in package. Looks like a bubble gum machine ring
1.0,"The material doesn't allow air to pass through, even without the filter in.  This material shouldn't be used for masks.  All of the air escapes around the side of the mask, rather than passing through the filter.  If you hold the material right against your lips, it's all you can do to get any air to pass through it, inhaling, or exhaling."
1.0,I'm disappointed in this hat I just received. First it fits my daughter's head not mine. Second it looks like a cowboy hat not anything like the pic.
1.0,Was too small and didn’t look anything like the picture
1.0,Really sheer and the fit is off. Quality not great but you get what you pay for. Lots of loose threading.
1.0,Did not like. I returned for a refund.
1.0,Quit working after 3 weeks. I guess you get what you pay for...
1.0,Too short... I'm 5'7&#34; 152 but I have a 34&#34; inseam. The jumpsuit came to my calf 😒
1.0,"I ordered the large and it was NOT comfortable at all!! It was still tight... not at all what I imagined. Plus, the thought of it possibly getting wet with all the hand washing... no! 😢"
1.0,The top is very nice but run a little small
1.0,"I wear a hat size 6 and these things are enormous. When I tie it tight enough to stay on my head, I’m unable to use the buttons in the intended way. Maybe I just bought the wrong style? Sigh. The perils of shopping online."
1.0,"It's larger than anticipated and the quality does not seem that great.  Also, the oil scent does not last long at all on the provided stones.  Overall, disappointing."
1.0,The description said hold and it came entirely silver. I paid for a 3 day delivery it came in 7. I was overall very disappointed because they ruined my bday outfit
1.0,Received a plain light turquoise stone. Not at all like the picture. No depth or variation
1.0,The dress was of poor quality
1.0,I'm completely unable to use these. Theyre difficult to open and almost impossible to close OUTSIDE of the piercing. I haven't been able to get one to close once in a piercing. Who knows if they're good quality because all they're good for is sitting in a box
1.0,"WRONG ITEM! The item I received was actually 12 sets of tinsel earrings rather than bracelets as pictured. When I tried to contact the company to say I received the wrong item, it only gave me the option to return rather than a refund which I thought was silly. Because it wasn’t worth the hassle to return and wait for a refund later on, I ended up keeping them. I gave this item 1 star because it wasn’t the item I received. With that being said, the EARRINGS were super cute and I received tons of compliments on them. Couldn’t wear them for long because the tinsel starts to itch, but still cute. I’d rate the earrings 4 stars but again, received the wrong item."
1.0,"Super cheap material, cut isn’t exact, would not order again. Hole in front is smaller than pitctured and neck is super high."
1.0,I didn’t like this blouse the material was awful and so was the color
1.0,My mask is broke
1.0,"It’s very flimsy, zero support I would say it might be good for A/B cup and for someone very slim. Weirdest bra I’ve ever seen, and I’m 48, lol"
1.0,This is nothing more than weather stripping that has been packaged to say &#34;hat reducer.&#34;  I cannot get it to stick to my ball cap at all. Very disappointed!
1.0,It’s nothing like I expected and was very very disappointed! The shirt is poor quality and the graphics printed on the shirt looks like they didn’t even bother to get a high resolution image 🙄😒 Don’t recommend this and your better off getting an actual Def Leppard t shirt.
1.0,The fabric get so fake when I put it on my boyfriend told me that he could tell it was a cheap dress and that it was a pretty color red but the material just looked cheap. He was looking at the dress across the room and not up close so that says something!!
1.0,Poor quality looks cheap and the skirt isn't full enough to pull off the peasant look so the seems on the tiers look odd
1.0,"Was looking for a look-alike ALEX & ANI bracelet, but didn't want to spend the money, so settled for this bracelet. I would not recommend buying one, I have lost 1 of the charms, and have came very close to losing all of them, just happened to find them on the floor after they fell. They fall off at random times, I am always looking to make sure the 3 I have now are still attached. I have tried to tighten the rings the key chains are on, but doesn't help. Cute bracelet, but might as well have spent a little more money for a better quality bracelet."
1.0,Oversized is an understatement!
1.0,"The skirt of the dress matches the photo, the top portion is much longer than pictured, and is lighter than the coloring on the skirt half! also, I'm 5 foot 6 and the dress comes about 3 inches above my ankles! I love the fabric, so I'm going to turn it into a maxi skirt! Just bummed it's too short!"
1.0,"I was so disappointed with the thin fabric that I returned this item. Other than that, they were well made and comfortable. If you don’t mind very thin fabric on pants, then these would be fine for you."
1.0,"The size chart is way off! I'm a size 16 and ordered the XL (according to the size chart) and I couldn't pull this skirt up past my thighs. The material is NOT stretchy,,,at all! Not a good buy!"
1.0,"I thought it was for a pet lol, it was people size.<br />Quality was pretty good. Just not want I thought I ordered. One star because I’m still waiting for a refund. I sent it back end of February/ beginning of March."
1.0,The buttons were not sown on very good
1.0,This just snapped in half when I was trying to bend it back on. Material is SO cheap
1.0,I have the bike shorts and love them. Got the underwear to wear under leggings. Returned as the padding was about half the amount compared to the shorts
1.0,No cotton liner inside the underwear. Causes extreme itching and rashes.
1.0,The shoulder straps were too small to fit into. The seams started popping as soon as I tried to put it on
1.0,This dress wasn't as I expected..it's like spandex and when stretched it doesn't look right. Really thin and poor quality.
1.0,"I have had quite a pleasant experience with Mordenmiss (which I suspect is a play on or misspelling of Modernmiss, if that means anything). But, in all honesty, this shirt was too small, and the fabric too wrinkly. And to top it off, it came shriveled up as if it had just been born out of an egg. Yes, it was wrinkled and now, because the return period passed me (I was busy, really), I have to figure out a way to unwrinkle it with a steam iron. Because of the indentations on the fabric, which is really strange because it is neither a solid cotton weave nor a ""jersey""/t-shirt material either, I don't think I can place it under a regular iron at any kind of temperature which will have any effect on it, other than burn it.<br /><br />I will wear it layered with something on top to disguise the strange and small cut around the shoulders.<br />Would I buy it if I were you? No.<br />Would I pass on it after reading this? Yes. 1) Shrunken undecipherable material in two green tones, 2) Odd cut on and around the shoulders which makes it feel small. 3) If you were intending to cover your behind, this will not do it because it comes up short when compared to the picture online."
1.0,"First off, I ordered the pumpkins and received the gnomes. Secondly, it was like someone tried to print the bleach look on to the sweatershirt instead of actually bleaching it. The picture was also so blurry and pixellated. It is thin and not soft either. Definitely would not recommend."
1.0,"We buy this particular dress every few months in whichever colour we fancy at the time. We have a closet full of POPZONE dresses because the style of the dress is simply perfect. However, the last order sent was a totally different dress, nothing like all the others. The cut was different, and the material was rayon, not ""95% cotton 5% spandex"". This dress was also packaged in a thinner bag than in the past, with unusual tags. The dress sent is being returned, in the hopes of getting what is listed, the dress we actually paid for."
1.0,This whole outfit was all wrong...
1.0,None fit as pictured and all were smaller than I expected due to the description. They had weird black marks on them and were very flimsy. I returned.
1.0,"It did not look anything like this picture, the material is do cheap it's dissolving into air"
1.0,"I'm size L/XL, 14, 38D, hourglass figure, and 5'2&#34; - ordered XL in black and it is way too small. I think the XL is closer to a medium or even small. I would have returned it but lost the bag it came in and wasn't sure if I could still send it back."
1.0,Need to say it is a ONE sided heart.
1.0,This is the worst thing I've ever got. It does not work and will be returning it.
1.0,"Lol. This shirt is total trash.  Not official at all. It’s a Fruit of the Loom shirt that has a very blurry, very poorly, (and illegally) digitally printed logo on it."
1.0,Does not fit an 8&#34; wrist... It has no real adjustments.
1.0,Muy mala no sirve
1.0,The pieces were too small... like for children sized... didn’t serve the purpose for an adult
1.0,This fits awkwardly. It's made in china. And the listing gives me no return option.
1.0,The sleeves were so small my gosh! It’s so unfortunate because the rest of the dress is so cute. Save your money!
1.0,Way too small for the size they display
1.0,This dress is a thin paper feeling material. Advertised as a cotton/polyester dress. There is no cotton in this dress and it definitely isn't polyester either. Save your money and say no to this!
1.0,All these glasses do is make the oncoming headlights look yellow -- but still glared.  Disappointing purchase.  I am returning.
1.0,"Cheap, itchy fabric with threads and yearn coming out everywhere. Not flattering or worth money"
1.0,Must be a child large.
1.0,Ordered a small and they could fit someone who wears an XL
1.0,Could fit a 2 year old
1.0,"I did not try it because of the size, The item was a teen suit and too small. I am currently in the process of returning it.  Therefore, I am unable to rate it for performance."
1.0,This jacket is not worth 30 dollars. I ordered a large and it’s super small on the arms and very short. One of the pictures advertised is completely different from the actual product. I feel like this jacket is a child’s size.
1.0,"Unfortunately not made out of good material at all, the rubber ripped just after about a week of use. Complete waste of money. Better to buy the Casio brand watch band replace, alrighty more expensive but at least it is good quality."
1.0,"The ""insert"" for the purse is quite small as is the chain! Missed return window so I'm stuck with a purse I can't use :("
1.0,Not REAL Polo socks
1.0,"Waste of time and postage cost.  These are 100% acrylic, 0% wool."
1.0,Too big for a kid and to expensive for the material.
1.0,Snaps broke the first time I unsnapped it
1.0,Why it said runs small ! So I got a bigger size and it way too big ! Now I have to go out of my way to return the jogging suit  ! And I bought 2 of them
1.0,Loved these pants. But when I bought two more pair they were obviously inches smaller all over. Tagged wrong and I have no idea which one is “correct” size. So disappointed. The first pair were amazing.
1.0,Is the ring 925 stamped?
1.0,The dress is so short and wide. Ordered a 3-4T and was way too short for my 1.5 y/o
1.0,It's made cheap not worth the money
1.0,I was NOT happy with this purchase. The colors are gorgeous however the fabric is smooth but doesn't stretch at all.  I can't even use as a blouse.
1.0,Top was nothing like the picture
1.0,"This top is cute and the material is nice but it's not cut evenly on the chest. One side gapes out really bad, totally not wearable. Missed the return window by a week :("
1.0,Love this shirt but very small! Nice quality
1.0,I purchased these pajamas for my grandson who loves Captain America they are the cheapest  roughest material I won’t even let him wear them . The top and bottoms are mismatched ( they don’t even go together plus two different types of cheap materials) . I couldn’t be bothered returning them as I would have had  to send them back to China and the postage’s would’ve  cost more there worth and my time . I’m very disappointed in this purchase . I would not recommend purchasing.
1.0,"These rings came a little over a month after I ordered them. They are gold, but that cheap looking color (which is fine they were like two bucks). I am disappointed because these were advertised as midi rings, but came in a Chinese size 18. All five of them. China 18 is a US size 9 which is enormous. Very upset because I was really excited to receive them."
1.0,Looks tacky and wristband feels bad. Clock is kinda cool though. You get what you pay for with this product.
1.0,"Will be returning these, they came damaged."
1.0,"Way larger than stated, 35 fits more like 38."
1.0,These smelled so rotten when taking out of the package. I immediately returned.
1.0,"What is pictured and described are not what I got. I even reorded another set TRYING to get the the  Oxidized Sterling Sliver Vintage Native<br />American earrings.Both times I got sterling silver BUT not the oxidized version as shown and described. So disappointed. Maybe it is a matter of the wrong number being placed on the earrings,because they are small,but cute. Sure woudl love to have a apir of the earrings as shown!"
1.0,"Great looking pants with some cool features but the rise is so short. These pants guarantee plumbers crack. I bought four different pants, including these, to find a go to work pant. On average the rise is about two inches shorter than the other pants. That means two inches in front and two inches in back."
1.0,Too bad it came wrinkled. It’s so bad it will never look like the item in the picture.<br />It’s a shame and will be going back
1.0,Definitely not unisex! I bought an XL for my husband and it's actually XS!
1.0,"This is a deceiving advertising, the mask pictured has nothing to do with the picture ,terribly disappointed what you get is a copy on fabric that doesn't even resemble the picture, don't buy this don't waste your money"
1.0,These are not oversized! They are too tight and they pinch and they sit way too far off the face to be effective. They are officially now the backup to my backup pair of sunglasses.
1.0,"I bought these specifically for the behind-the-ear hooks. They look and feel more secure and comfortable than products that are just the hooks (not the straps), but they quickly deteriorate, tear and fall off. As for the straps, they are short and wouldn’t connect behind an adult’s head. They are also the kind of rubbery plastic that would irritate pull hair out. I wish I could find ergonomic behind the ear hooks that last."
1.0,We have had these slippers for literally 10 minutes. The sole came off immediately. Complete garbage. If only I could give zero stars
1.0,"I thought this was a legitimate product when i bought it but I was wrong.  One of the watch winders stopped working after 3 months.  Then the fun began, for warranty service they sent me a motor that I'm supposed to install removing the failed one.  I have no idea how to open this watch winder to do this.  You need to be an electronics surgeon to fix this. They initially told me they were sending me a replacement watch winder but I got a dime store motor instead."
1.0,"This is just a cheap beanie with an extremely thin, loose patch only sewed at each end. Definitely not worth the cost. We are very disappointed in this product."
1.0,"I ordered the shirt in a 2xL even though my usual size is L because typically clothes coming from China run smaller. 3 things are wrong with the shirt. 1) cheaply made 2) it's as short as a crop top 3) the sizing isn't even close, if I were to go off US sizing I would say the shirt is a petite large, that's a huge size difference from the 2xL I ordered. Very disappointed."
1.0,The leather strap that goes across the foot is partially attached and damaged the shoe. I will be returning.
1.0,Says it will fit up to 38 c cup. A 2 year old might be able to wear them
1.0,Item comes in plastic ziplock bag not appropriate to give to someone for a gift
1.0,"I like the skirt, the fit, but it is so cheaply made, it has a hole and the waistband spins around inside the waist, not sewed in?"
1.0,It was too small tight in the hips.Material was okay
1.0,"The belt arrived on time, but its length was much shorter than described and too small for me."
1.0,"Save your money, they fit weird. The material is shiny stretchy so it is not very flattering.  I regret not returning. I tried to make best of it but live and learn."
1.0,"I was disappointed it was going to be a gift for my fiancés birthday. He's a 2XL so I got a 5XL so it can fit right cause I saw people said it was too small and it was way to small! What tf is 5XL to y'all people. Dupe side pockets not real. No inside pockets at all which is the feature he mainly wanted. This ""vest"" is just a fashion statement. I got a very picky punk. Not Punk approved."
1.0,"If you’re 5’6” and below it might fit you.  The body is extremely short, even as a 2X, it didn’t even hit my waste.  Super hero belly shirt I guess."
1.0,"Ugh. These are far too small, don't go all the way up to waist and sit uncomfortably on the hips while most unpleasantly cutting into the crotch. I'm seriously getting really tired of returning Chinese clothing that's just totally off. Have never had so many clothes fit so badly."
1.0,It was more of a bonnet than a hat. Way too small
1.0,"The ring is pretty, but Novica did not make very well.  The copper band, from the other two bands, is copper overlay and is wearing off.  The inside of the copper band is also turning black.  I'm attaching the best photo I could get.  Would not recommend purchasing.  Very dissatisfied."
1.0,Always inconsistent sizing information.
1.0,The glasses were broke on arrival. So disappointed!
1.0,I gauged up to a 0 recently and my ears feel pretty healed not fully but I went to put a pair in and they don’t fit. The ends of them are bigger than my ear right now. I went to measure the the ends of the stone gauges and they are 00 but the middle of them are 0.
1.0,Honestly don't waste your money.
1.0,"Purse is cute, but extremely thin, not durable.  Zipper is thin/fragile.  Jammed first time unzipping purse.  Be sure not to overload nor put anything weighted to carry."
1.0,"3X? Umm, yeah right. I wear a 1x or 2x t-shirt. I am a muscular extra large, not a chubby extra large, so it's not like my gut won't allow the jacket to close. The actual size is about 40, not the 48 I need or what was advertised. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE."
1.0,The extra large fit like an american small.  Gave it to our daughter.
1.0,Arrived in pieces and missing pieces as well.
1.0,It's very hard to breathe in it. Feels like your suffocating.
1.0,i was happy when i bought this but a day later the color was wearing off
1.0,Cute hat but for a small head🥺.
1.0,I liked nothing about this.  Period!
1.0,They work good so far but the package is missing the navy blue one which is really the one we needed for the watch. Unfortunately I'm unable to return because he needs the watch now. Definitely a bummer!
1.0,"These fit everywhere except my hips/butt. They were just too tight, the fabric was stretched visibly at the hips."
1.0,Jacket fits great. I loved it at first.  I’ve only had to wear it a handful of times because it’s still warm in the south and already 2 of the 3 snaps on the front have ripped out as I was trying to take it off. Fits great. It’s very warm but poorly made. You’ll end up having to buy a different jacket. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,As you can see the color is coming off and it's causing sharp edges. I've contacted the seller and have no response. Very dissatisfied customer since this is the third one I've ordered.
1.0,These are see-through. You can totally see the pockets through the front. Will be returning.
1.0,Waste of money handle broke into days
1.0,THIS CAME TO ME BROKEN
1.0,"When I first saw the necklace, it looked real.<br />After 2 days it turned."
1.0,ear piece fell off in less than 30 days
1.0,Muy mala la tela es horrible muy corriente
1.0,I was expecting a full set not just one earring of pearls and one of cubic zirconiam. So I look like a pirate and not a good look for the office.
1.0,feels like paper
1.0,The stripe down the center in the photo was on the left & not the center. Material & style was great. I love Made By Johnny products because they are made in the USA.
1.0,Ends of metal connection stick out sides. Never had this problem with bands before.
1.0,The first time I got my glasses the paint was chipped off and they where just horrible! So I bought again and paint was chipped again ! I do not recommend!
1.0,"Very Very disappointed with this pair of PINK earrings.  One earring had a spot on it.  THe spot was dark brown and very noticeable.  One earring was missing the holder on the back.  It was completely detached from the earring.  Also, the post was entirely bent over to the side of the earring.<br />Truly sad about the condition of these darling and perfect color earrings.<br />I  hope the seller sees fit to send me another pair.  No way, can I wear these earrings."
1.0,This was meant for my husband but it didn’t fit his head. I tried it on and it’s painfully tight. Heck even my 10 year old didn’t like it bc it was too small. Who’s head is this supposed to fit on?
1.0,The sizing on these shoes are WAY off. I ordered a toddler 7 and they looked like more of a kids size 10-12. I pulled out one of my daughter's normal toddler 7 shoes and they were almost double in size. I checked and they were either mismarked as a 7 or this company doesn't know how to size kids' shoes.
1.0,"I order on Amazon fairly often. My daughter had decided to put together costuming for Halloween and a Cosplay event and the character she was playing as needed a hat so I thought Amazon would be a good place to look.<br /><br />We ordered the hat 2 weeks before the event and the estimated arrival was scheduled for at latest Oct 30th. The hat just arrived yesterday (Nov 13) thus missing the cosplay event and Halloween.<br /><br />I have to say, regardless of the quality of the hat. This is unacceptable and poor service. I will not be shopping with this seller again."
1.0,Stitching came undone - could have easily lost my watch if I hadn't noticed in time!  Don't buy.
1.0,"Immediately, after getting my watch band, it started peeling off. Very cheaply made do not recommend."
1.0,Hard to adjust and pins fell out!
1.0,"Nothing like the picture, seems to be decent quality but these shorts are so much longer and wider in the legs than expected. They are extremely unflattering and I'm disappointed to say the least."
1.0,I use belly piercing about 12 years and that’s the first time that I got an infection after use that.<br />I do not recommend.
1.0,It's  not an Infinity scarf and  no butterflies
1.0,I love my Fitbit and Mickey and was psyched to find this in April.  Seven months later it looks like this...very disappointed.  Just every day use.  I leave my Fitbit on all the time except to shower.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,Poor quality and came scratched.
1.0,Thin stretchy fabric and size ran a tad small. The image was ironed on and not stitched on like the other similar brands I’ve ordered from Amazon.
1.0,"Although they are adorable, the got scratched up almost immediately. Now just 3 months in and they are unwearable. For the cost these are not worth it."
1.0,Im an 8.5 so it's what I ordered. It's Atleast a whole size too small.
1.0,Runs huge! Weird fit
1.0,"Was hoping to like these, cause of good reviews but i took them out of the box and put them on and the socks started to fray immediately, also they are very long go up over my knee and keep rolling down. Uncomfortable."
1.0,Cheaply made quality shoe.
1.0,My ears turned green after wearing them for 24 hrs. I am very disappointed in this product.
1.0,Post broke on the first screw in. To return the product costs more than buying it so I just threw it away.
1.0,It is for large wrist and too long for my wife's wrist.
1.0,Ordered twice and both times only one pair arrived
1.0,This shoe runs extremely big. I am a tire to size 6.5 and I purchased this item in January and now that the weather permits in March I have just now decided to attempt to wear the item. My foot literally slipped completely through the open toe of the shoe therefore I never wore the item and completely wasted my money. I'm so disappointed in this item to say the least 😔. Unfortunately I'm sure it's too late to even exchange this unworn item.
1.0,"One month and a week from the purchase of this watch band, it broke, letting my smartwatch tumble to the sidewalk. While putting the broken band in my pocket, the band broke on the opposite side in the exact same manner. Not where the installment pins are (that's another issue I'll mention later) but the screws that hold the plastic links together.<br /><br />One of the silver screws on the band had unscrewed - they look great, but against all logic, these individual screws are not decorative. They are functional screws with exceptionally shallow threading. Your plastic watch band is being held together by over a dozen cheap screws with threads that are less than a half a millimeter deep. It's not whether one of those many teeny weeny screws is going to fail - the only question is WHEN is it going to happen, and how damaged will your watch be after it hits the pavement?<br /><br />In addition to the broken springs / links issue, when I removed the broken band, I found that the one month, one week old spring pins which connect the band to the watch were abysmally rusted. Yet another weak point that most  certainly would have eventually failed if the screws hadn't already popped out.<br /><br />So, this all happened one week out of the 30 day warranty. Amazon made good on a refund even though the seller wasn't Amazon. When I contacted the seller after Amazon have me a refund, the emailed response was a single line. &#34;OK we will try to make better watch bands.&#34;<br /><br />It's a shame because the design is really, really neat - but I would hesitate to put a timepiece of any quality on this band because it is flawed on so many levels and will fail at some point down the line.<br /><br />Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."
1.0,the jacket has manufacturing errors the sleeves are reversed
1.0,Nothing like it appears online...CHEAP imitation.
1.0,"If this dress was made with a more substantial/natural material it would be great. I liked how it looked but it felt like really thin legging material--but not see through which I guess is a bonus.<br />I got size large, I'm 37-29-39 and it was skin tight through the torso. I sent it back because I couldn't imagine where I would wear this unless it was a house dress."
1.0,It is to small.
1.0,The underwire was exposed on the first wear. Can not wear now because the underwire cuts my armpit
1.0,Complete trash. I only bought it for a costume and had no intentions of wearing it again but it again but it wasn’t even good enough for one time use.<br /><br />It broke in the car on my way to the Halloween party. I was just sitting in the car. It’s so poorly made!!<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
1.0,"I opened up the pack of earrings, ready to put them on and 2 pairs broke! They are junk!"
1.0,"Tote just arrived very disappointed- white area covered with black dots, resembles mildew. Doesn’t smell, but looks awful. Was going to be a gift, but this is garbage."
1.0,"Big cheap looking and feeling watch, I sent it back."
1.0,"Loved the size and design of the wallet, but lacks quality.  Strap ripped after 2 months of use.  Zipper sticks at times.  Bummer, now it’s garbage."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this, and I'm willing to try others from this brand but JEBUS!! I don't know if they made mine extra short or what but it literally will not even cover up my rump! Then, when I take it off and try to zip it up, I was trying it on, the zipper just came right off!! I'm so disappointed and now have to figure out another costume ASAP!"
1.0,Dislike the shape and way too large but thefe was not an xs
1.0,This product needs a second person to help put it on… Purchase many others that are much better would save my money on this one
1.0,I thought this was Sterling Silver. The chain has tarnished on one side and the clasp. Will not by this brand again
1.0,"You get what you pay for!  These leggings were very cute, very soft, and very thin.  They do run a tad small.  The first time I put them on they developed a hole under my butt cheek:("
1.0,"Poor quality, badly fitted breast cups don't fit. Too cheap to wear, but too much hassle to return. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Cheaply made. Dethreading after first wash and color bleed.
1.0,"This thing is absolutely massive, like can barely fit it in your pocket.  Not to mention it lacks quality. In person it almost looks laminated and very cheap, but you get what you pay for."
1.0,I did not like the fit of the sleeves on this garment.  One size does not fit all.  Only way I could wear this is to cut the sleeves out.
1.0,"much tighter than expected.  I was disappointed as the shirt seemed so casual chic  The quality wasn't bad, just the fit was so not as expected."
1.0,"Material is horrible, more like rayon or worse. Description says jogger or yoga…not even close. Dark grey looks purple not like shown. Very disappointed, returning."
1.0,"I’ve never seen slacks with a stripe before, if I worked in a circus maybe I’d buy these!"
1.0,These straps were a real disappointment!  They tore up within a week of putting them on the bag.
1.0,I bought 2 pairs for my son of this same sandal different colors. I am not sure why this pair is is doing this. He can’t even wear them because it’s scratching his foot
1.0,It doesn't fit my watch
1.0,It's very hard to put on time
1.0,Way smaller than the pic
1.0,Great for the look but not comfortable.
1.0,These are so small as to almost be nonexistant....good for a child's first earings maybe...not an adult!
1.0,Im 5'8 and fairly average weight wise. I ordered an extra large but I received a large that fits my best friend.....she wears a small. This was a waste of my money
1.0,These plugs are way too skinny and come rough around the edges. Stay away...
1.0,"Color was suppose to be like a bright teal green blue. Color above, maybe a pale mint? And too short. Fits like a large. I ordered a 3x. Gave to my niece."
1.0,I do not recommend these leggings. The material is not comfortable for a whole day and after washing on a delicate and low wash once they are see through :(
1.0,I really wanted to like this item.  It's very uncomfortable and ruins any hair due!
1.0,"I liked this badge despite the negative reviews. It broke the first day I wore it so I had it replaced, which was speedy and hassle-free. Received the replacement and you guessed it- that one broke too! Don't waste your time."
1.0,"It looks like a sweatshirt, but it is a nylon like shirt, picture does not look like what you receive."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:aa49fff8981f9e67d2fae3574d42121b]]
1.0,Awful! absolutely ridiculous! I was excited because it looked super cute online but it turned out to be very cheap fabric. It makes you look like a sack of potatoes even if you have curves. The dress looks nothing like it did on the picture online. I don't like it at all and I'm not one to write bad reviews. Think again before ordering this product!
1.0,The band does not snap on in place I almost lost the fitbit this weekend. I wish they paid attention to the snap more than the band.
1.0,"It looked great at the beginning, felt heavy too therefore I thought it would be good quality.<br />I am a counter person at an auto parts store. I put on the band at the beginning of my shift and by the end of my shift the paint from parts of the watch was rubbed off. It was on nothing out of the ordinary or strenuous. Just the fact that the band would touch the counter when I would go type on my keyboard made it come off."
1.0,"Poor quality, pants ripped in the first 12 hours of wearing them. Very rough material not comfortable. Disappointed, especially for the price of the item."
1.0,Bought 6-8 for my slim 5 yr old boy… can’t even close the shirt/jacket on him. Barely got his arms in sleeves. I don’t have time to return so guess he’ll have to wear it open.
1.0,"do not buy these evil earrings. They are the size of my pinkie toe nail, and they are impossible to close. I was excited to buy them because my ears are very sensitive and i needed earrings that would not cause an infection. Since i spent about 30 minutes just trying to close the earring in my ear, i'm sure now i will get an infection. I want to know who designed these things and why they thought it was a good idea. They BARELY fit in my ear, and once i finally got them in i couldn't even close them because they required the force of hulk to push the damn wire back into the microscopic hole. As i write this review my ear is on fire from all the abuse it took trying to get these earrings to work. I gave up in the end, and just put a different pair in. SCREW THESE BASTARDS"
1.0,I do not recommend these!! Not flowy. Like the picture; threads from raw hems; very unflattering fit!! Very disappointed!!
1.0,Roughly made and hurts put it through.....
1.0,Horrible. Very thin and cheap material. Seller sent wrong sizzle and wrong color.
1.0,Not what we were looking for.  Sent back.  Tail was very thick and stiff.
1.0,It’s looks used and the color is turning to green
1.0,The product is misleading.  There is no bling.  It is only a picture of being.  Very disappointed.
1.0,When we received it it was dead so I'm not even sure if it works
1.0,Tight and cheap
1.0,The padding in the sole bunches up. Feels like a rock in the sole of the slipper. Cool design. Poor manufacturing. Their new home... The dump.
1.0,They do not flex at all making walking difficult plus it makes to look like a moron
1.0,Very chip!
1.0,"My original feedback about the product sold to me by Cool2 dayINC was removed because I was slamming the product that they sold me.  When they contacted me to ask what they could do to correct the problem, I told them to do whatever would not cost me anymore time or money to get my review of them shipping garbage to me.  They told Amazon that I had reviewed the product that they had not checked to defeat and that for all I know, they make or have made exclusively for them.  The point of writing the review about the product that the PERSON WHO SOLD ME THE PRODUCT is to let follow consumers know that this vendor's product line is possibly all just as carefully inspected before they take your money and ship it."
1.0,Not as shown as picture. Bad sizing and cheap hollow quality. Did not fit an adult and or my teenage daughter fingers. Not worth the good price or quality for my time to return.
1.0,"Nice looking gloves, but they developed a rip along the outer seam at the wrist on the right hand glove after wearing them about 15-20 times. I'd had them less than 2 months when I noticed the tear. Definitely not long enough to wear out a pair of gloves, but long enough that the return window has closed. If they held up as well as they look, these would be some really great gloves."
1.0,"Different look, not what the picture shows"
1.0,"Not anything like the picture, so short and tight. The color is also not as pictured. Be aware that this will cost you to return. Not a prime item. Still awaiting my monies."
1.0,"It was a lot smaller than I thought,<br />There were no return receipts or label in the box to return the purse."
1.0,I wore this over a cream color shirt.... it was awful!!! After 1 hour I took it off to adjust to the new indoor temp and I had those fine black fuzz/lints all over me. My shirt looks grey and it took like 10 sheets from the lint roller to look almost normal again but the little hairs were still all over me. Next I wore it with dark colors trying to give it another shot.... same thing and you could still tell I had lint everywhere now pants everywhere. It was bad!!! I wouldn’t buy again.
1.0,Bought this for my daughter's graduation for her and her friends; within 5 minutes of wearing them they all broke. My daughter's broke first during the champagne toast then the other 2 by the end of the party. I am sooo disappointed.
1.0,It came down to my ankle
1.0,This bracelet was awful I put it on and it broke never got to wear it
1.0,Sent back for refund. Doesn’t look like the picture. The material is very cheap and it’s a weird printed design. May be great for some but I wasn’t a fan!
1.0,"Very disappointed, turned black on my ear after first time wearing it...so disappointed"
1.0,This was extremely large. Too large in fact to even work for me. I had all the extra links removed and everything. If you have a small wrist do not waste your time on it.
1.0,Item was too large for my 24 inch suitcase. Would like to return but just learned the &#34;return window&#34; is closed. Now stuck with it.
1.0,Horrible! Got a star because I had to give it a star. My order was the orange and white jumpsuit. I ordered the size that I measured to order. It 'fit' except it gave me MAJOR camel toe. And it looked like a cheap jump suit a character from Dumb and Dumber would wear. Horrible and I'm returning! I can't eve think of a friend to give this away to. NO WAY I would include a video.
1.0,I purchased  an xxxl because the reviews say it ran small and I usually wear xl sometimes XXL because I like my clothes loose and flowy. I received the xxxl and it fit like a medium. It was terrible and I would never recommend this product.  The model in the picture is probably  wearing an XXL the way it looks on her there is no way the size matches.
1.0,"Lamentablemente no lo he resivido mi producto, quedó de llegar el 28 de noviembre y no lo he resivido."
1.0,"Picture is pixilated, and the image isn’t exactly the same as the one shown. It is like zoomed in or spread out. The mouth is HUGE."
1.0,Don't recommend cheap quality will never buy again. Broke on the first wear . Not worth the money or time.
1.0,Never got the chance to use them. I exchange the shoes 3 time. It went from size 9 too big to size 8.5 too big to 7.5 too small and they didn't have size 8. My daughter wears size 9. Cute but the size is not correct
1.0,Look super cheap. I’m gonna keep it but very disappointed
1.0,Very cheap looking.  I do not recommend this product.  It took a long time to ship.
1.0,Very good poor workmanship.
1.0,Bought and sent to a friend as a gift but one was missing the hook part. As a gift it was a little embarrassing to ask her to mail them to me so I could return them. For the cheap cost I think the should have just replaced them.
1.0,These are like kids sizes. Very small.
1.0,These rings were made for a child’s fingers. I wear a size 7 1/2 and the advertisement claims to fit all but it doesn’t. Cute rings but didn’t fit unfortunately
1.0,This purse straight up catfished me. It's not the correct size at all! This was underwhelming
1.0,"I ordered according to the size chart, which ended up being my bra size. The band is extra stretchy and did not hold anything tight. The actual cup contains a third of my breast and the rest kind of just spills to the sides. The shape of the actual cup is a wide oval..."
1.0,NOT WORTH IT
1.0,Pattern was upside down on dress
1.0,"The shirt fits great, just not the color I ordered."
1.0,Kapp
1.0,This was suppose to be a women's size medium would.  Fit like a child medium.  But received a refund
1.0,Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage!
1.0,Very cheap. As soon as the return date passed the heart fell out of the setting!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!
1.0,The material is not good at at. Looks very cheap in person. If the manufacturer used a cotton blend this would be an amazing little dress/cover up. The design is beautiful just poor choice of material. Waste of money- Returning
1.0,"Bought the gray, navy and black pair. First put them on and thought how great the fit was and how soft they were. Within four hours holes started popping up. I was only sitting at my desk!  Not recommended at all."
1.0,"I received my skirt today and the material is nice and the pattern is pretty. The skirt is poorly sewn and came apart as soon as I tried it on. I am 5 ft 3 in tall and typically wear about a size medium. I read the reviews and sized up. The skirt was big and bulky.  When I  requested to return the skirt, the company told me that I could not, due to them being located in Asia and offered me a 30%  refund on the skirt. I will not be ordering anything from them again."
1.0,Too thin not impressed poor quality
1.0,This product broke the first time I tried to close it.
1.0,It broke the next day that I bought it. The fish disconnected from the chain. It looked nice in the beginning but didn't last more than a day!
1.0,NOT purple more like maroon. Didn’t match what I wanted them for.
1.0,Very light weight not what I hoped.
1.0,"Raggedy, was hoping it would be a pleasant, slimming cute top  but it's super loose at the bottom instead of form fitting. Won't even bother with the hassle of returning it. The cloth like material makes it a nice house rag."
1.0,They ripped the first time we wore them.... cheap
1.0,Delivered with a hole in the sleeve that appears to have been there through the entire manufacturing process.  Paper thin material.  Junk.
1.0,"This band fell apart because the screw fell out after wearing it 2 weeks, max..."
1.0,Got it for a Christmas gift. 1st week it wouldn't keep time. How do u return it??
1.0,"BEWARE! This shirt is nothing like pictured. Wrong color, wrong pattern, wrong stye and stretchy and thin. It's awful and very disappointing. It's almost as if they selected a random shirt and mailed it. Never had this issue ever until now. Thanks for the wrong shirt guys! It's hideous."
1.0,Very thin paper material and sleeves are cut very small. Does not look like picture. Poorly made
1.0,"This purse has silver detailing, not gold. The picture is deceiving. And for $200, you’d think it would be identical to the product."
1.0,Very cheap. Easily snags.
1.0,The thumb ripped at the seem as soon as I put the glove on. Not very durable. Amazon was prompt in giving me a refund.
1.0,"Only one side will stay connected, have adjusted set screws, does not help at all. Doesn't connect well at all"
1.0,Cute dress but terrible quality. Ripped down both sides first wear. To the trash it goes.
1.0,This purse is very pretty. I bought it the first of September 2019. I use it every day. I don’t think I am abusive of it and take good care of it. I just noticed that the leather oblong the bottom edges are already worn. It is very disappointing to spend $250 on a purse and have that kind of wear in 6 months! ridiculous! I have been buying Coach purses for years and this is the most expensive one that I have bought. I think that Coach should do something about this. I am mad!
1.0,"Beautiful dress, although much brighter in person than in pictures. Fit great. Perfect length. But within 1-2 washes, it has holes. I ordered two dresses. And they both have holes."
1.0,This item is sized for a child in the shoulders. Company refuses refund and refuses to send prepaid shipping label. They said twice that I should gift it to someone else and they would give me 30% off of it. What a joke! They are not good enough to sell under Amazon's name
1.0,Really really small and is only for babies and  toddlers
1.0,"As some others mentioned, this is designed for a woman, with the buttons on the wrong side."
1.0,The image was showed about 10 of them but when I got it I only got one a it was super tiny
1.0,"HORRIBLE. I read the reviews said cheap quality, I didn’t understand truly what these people meant until I got it. The quality is so bad I wouldn’t be surprised if it melted if I put it in water. Feels like paper."
1.0,It fits okay feels like girl shorts though. pockets are really small and the fabric quality is not good either.
1.0,i was bummed they didnt fit me must of been a junior xl
1.0,no good  paper  weight  garbage
1.0,Too much side boob exposed.
1.0,The hole for the button was not there an the zipper was not connected
1.0,Got the ears in 3 pieces.... not happy
1.0,"I happen to know a lot about sunglasses. If the polarization filters are even slightly askew--headache city. This was headache city in a matter of minutes.  I cannot say how many come this way, but this pair did."
1.0,not at the size that the size chart said and i would not recommend
1.0,"Too tight, I returned it."
1.0,Sweater is actually a size medium even though states one size fits all.
1.0,size a couple sizes up
1.0,"Loved it but the magnet did not hold and it fell off the first day I wore it and I lost it.  I am sad because it is very cute,"
1.0,"This skirt is cute, but it was at least two sizes too small. Sending back asap."
1.0,Looks different from what was seen the material is cheap ...very disappointed
1.0,Looks like an “old lady” swimsuit. Skirt is too long. Fit was perfect though.
1.0,I had these less than a week and the arm broke off from the sunglasses. And apparently this is an item that you cannot return.
1.0,VERY cheaply made and WAY too small. Do not waste your money!
1.0,"I thought it would be cool to get a mystery pack of shirts and see what came of it. Nope, that was a mistake. I received 3 shirts and I would never wear any of them. One was just a piece of fabric attached to an actual chain that worked as a halter. One was a black see-through sheer shirt, and the final one was also black and was designed to fall off the shoulders, but the chest was so large that it just fell right off me completely. Sorry, I have a tiny chest and can not wear that type of shirt.<br /><br />In the end nothing was kept and I donated all of it. No thank you."
1.0,Terrible wish I would have seen the reviews first! Thin useless material! Looks like they cut the material and that’s it! I could have made one better using real material not this thin crap! Can’t believe what they charge for this crap!
1.0,"Returned iteam because they are much smaller than shown, and refund was never returned."
1.0,no no no
1.0,Even though if was a xs it was way ro big
1.0,This is so cheap and ugly. Looks like doll clothes. Also it’s TINY. I ordered a medium and it might fit my baby.
1.0,Stay away from this product cheaply made
1.0,"The description describes them as adjustable, they are not. And they clamp very very tight."
1.0,very disappointed .. the material is cheap and ugly and it looks like if it was made by a 5 years old .. what a shame!
1.0,This Seller does not give you a free refund and sends the item very late !!! The Dress does not look like it’s picture and is not a perfect fit. Has many flaws !!
1.0,"They’re cute but after one wash, they shrunk. I wore them once before getting rid of them. I have thick legs, the shorts became too small"
1.0,"Leaked like a sieve the minute it was filled. Had to ditch it because it was making too much mess, so I unfortunately don't even have it to return it!!"
1.0,So.. I had to go YouTube to find out how to wrap this waistband. Then come to find out there’s nothing you can attach it to because the Velcro is on the wrong side. The girl on the YouTube video had the same problem so I’m thinking she ordered hers from here to or from this retailer. What a waste of money don’t do it
1.0,Pure Garbage. One ripped after the slightest stretch to fit head straight out of the packaging.
1.0,Terrible this turned my neck green within hours of wearing it!
1.0,"As soon as he tried to put it on, the snap broke. I had to use a zip tie to hold it to the mask. Once rigged so it could be worth, there was a sharp nub from the factory form right where it sits on the forehead. I had to glue some foam to cover it. When I tried to return it, it is said ""This item cannot be returned."""
1.0,Very cheaply made! Comes faded so not buy
1.0,"Very prickly and once you wash them, even in cold water, they do not withstand that well."
1.0,the material came frayed
1.0,Doesn't fit or flow well
1.0,"This is pretty self explanatory. I can’t believe they shipped this out and thought it would look good. Top is completely see through. I can see the boob pads and my actual under boob. It fit ok, but the quality is just so poor. Not only did I pay extra to get it shipped quickly since my wedding is in a month, but I also have to pay for shipping to return it. I would give zero stars if I could."
1.0,"I thought it was going to be bigger (I took a picture of the piercing I received right next to the size that I was expecting it to be). Kinda disappointed that something so small costs so much too. I guess I could give it to someone else, but I was really looking forward to wearing it."
1.0,DO NOT BUY IT!!! IT IS NOT 100% Neoprene / 100% Cotton.<br /><br />No lo compren!!! No es 100% Neoprene / 100% Cotton como dicen.  Fue un error comprar esto que no sirve.
1.0,The magnets are too weak. They don't work at all.
1.0,"item is cheap looking but I did not pay a lot for it, the problem is it stopped working after 1 1/2 days. Will not return it since it is a hassel DONT BUY !!!!"
1.0,The paper flowers are glued on with remaining strings of glue still visible AND ALL my flowers have fallen off. This was truly a waste of money!
1.0,It was lightweight material and left and right side patterns were mismatched!!!  Just a piece of junk.  I returned it immediately.
1.0,"Not as expected...more of a fitted dress and not Flowy as advertised.I would not , it is a long fitted dress and I wanted the dress that is shown on the picture.I won't purchase again.I am not a large, and I purchased a large for a loose effect, and it was still too small."
1.0,It is much too lose. You can see in the pictures how baggy they are so I HIGHLY recommend you buy 1 or even 2 sizes down.. I am normally a medium so that is what I went for but they just look silly. You can also see that they are super see through! You can even see the tattoo on my leg through these pants! I don't recommend these pants and am surprised how bad they are for the price they charge..
1.0,Looks extremely cheap
1.0,Never wore it. You get what you pay for.
1.0,Not true 3x - order larger ladies not much give in the mid section. Pictured shirt is decieving...  but good material
1.0,This broke within three weeks of use. One strap completely unraveled to thread. It was super cute. Disappointed.
1.0,"These sandles are very cute, but they do not last. My 4 yr-old son only worn them for a month, and the velco no longer closes."
1.0,save your money...too small and not made well
1.0,"Ordered XL. Sweats were sized for a tall, very small man"
1.0,TINY. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Loved these, but after I wore then 4, maybe 5 times, they broke! Too late to return and very disappointed, they fall apart 10 days after the refund period is up!!"
1.0,"Too large for me. Am probably going to give it away, just doesn't fit me."
1.0,"Too big because the mask is unable to be tied tightly enough and slips. When held in the correct position, it was very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Can't be returned."
1.0,I paid for random  charms and I received huggy wuggy only charms and im not the 1st one yo received this set like this. They are not even picture in the advertisement. My kids were really disappointed
1.0,Low quality! Save your money! You can buy much better quality slippers at Walmart
1.0,"not great for eye protection. how dissapointed can I be though for the price...you get what you pay for. if you don't care about protection you eyes from the sun and are simply going for style, they are good and funky!"
1.0,SENT IT BACK HORRIBLE
1.0,half the size after wash...don't buy
1.0,"These came in a nice case and are very light weight but that's about all the good things I have to say.  The lenses in both pairs were foggy, there's a terrible glare and they smell HORRIBLE.  Like burning plastic or an electrical fire.  I seriously put them on and kept catching a whiff of something nasty so I walked around my whole place thinking I had something burning and it turns out it was the glasses.  I didn't see any other complaints so this could totally be a one off situation.  I've tried a few brands and a lot of them have been foggy but I know there are clear ones out there so it may just be a case of ""you get what you pay for"".  I also felt like they were a little flimsy compared to some others so I'm just going to try another brand."
1.0,Horrible nails!!!! Don’t buy them!  Poor quality.  There’s no comparison to Kiss or ImPress nails.
1.0,Should have bought the real Breitling strap.
1.0,"The wallet is very cute, however the credit card slots are not connected, so if you put a card in it, it will go all the way to the bottom and its next to impossible to get it out. Very disappointing."
1.0,Es demasiado pequeño.
1.0,They were defected. I threw them away as soon as I was finished with my walk. Only reason I wore them was because it was all I had
1.0,This ruined my Louis Vuitton Suede Shoes. It discolored the suede & my brand new shoes are ruined. Very Upset by the false advertising. DO NOT BUY for Suede!
1.0,"The picture looks great, only its an iron on embroidered, and it was pealing off. Its a waste sadly to buy."
1.0,Necklace was defective upon arrival. I have it in several colors and this is the first one that was broken.
1.0,Cute but i wasn’t able to wear neither pair because they wouldn’t close :( also they are very very small
1.0,Transparent!  Not a fan of the fabric
1.0,Ordered small medium and XXL. They all fit me just the size on the tag is different.<br /><br />They say not to wash them except by hand or dry clean… that is kinda stupid for an apron fabric.<br /><br />The fabric is very thin. Not well sewn.<br /><br />I would not buy them again but you get what you pay for.
1.0,I did not like to collar at all. Big factor to why I wouldn’t wear and ultimately returned it.
1.0,I wanted 22mm and that isn't right don't fit at all
1.0,Too too small not like the picture show
1.0,"Skirt too big, top to small, awkward sleeves. Wrinkled up garbage."
1.0,I Like the watch but it was to big for me so I was not happy I will like to get one that can work for me. .
1.0,"Not the greatest hat, and wasn't quite what I was expecting"
1.0,Bottoms way to small. Size not accurate
1.0,Poor quality. Not as advertised.
1.0,Did not work so I sent them back.
1.0,"This was the oddest pair of leggings to put on. I trusted the reviews and ordered a size up with plans to exchange if the larger size was too big. No big deal.<br />But instead I’ll be returning for a refund because the size is all over the place. The legs were baggy and it bulged in weird places. The waist band fit like a size small/medium. Now to give some perspective, I have a more hourglass shape with a waist measurement much smaller than my hips. Usually the issue I have with pants is fitting in the legs and hips but being a bit loose around the waist.<br /><br />Overall a very odd fitting pair of leggings."
1.0,"Too big. Can't see Mom and I love you. It is definitely NOT like the picture. When I took a picture of it, I had to crop the picture in order to be able to read the print. Definitely going to get a refund because I feel like I got ripped off."
1.0,So pretty but received broken I will try to make my own ear holders. Also No backings received. My mother just passed away. I wanted to wear these for her memorial 6 month coming up. I guess I could find a string or thin chain. One was broken. The other in tack. As soon as I tried it on the earring insert broke. The wings are not so heavy. But the hooks were inappropriate for the weight. Not worth the expense to return. I’m disabled. Driving to UPS costs more then shipping return too. You have no Customer service contact. If so I will change my review.
1.0,"The dress was very loose and baggy, the waist was like Empire style and nothing like the picture."
1.0,This tank top is flared at the bottom and the color/fabric is nothing like what’s picture.
1.0,Isn’t this the lupus purple with the butterfly not fibromyalgia??
1.0,Returned was very flimsy. Was not automatic open and it felt like after opening a few times it would break. Wish they would make it better quality loved the material
1.0,"Cheap product....chest tie straps are too close to armpit area. Dress material is very thin and ripped when I took it off. I'm 511, 160 lbs with a 36D bra size. I had ordered a size Large. Don't waste your money!!! Mines in the trash"
1.0,The clip to keep it on broke on day 2. Complete waste of $5
1.0,"IMO not wool.  They felt soft but not warm like merino wool and I needed them to be for a trip to somewhere cold.  I burned a piece of loose yarn and compared it with some from a Smartwool sock with the same material content to compare. Smartwool left soot and this had none, just melted.  Wishful thinking at this price."
1.0,Don’t waste your money. Received first order and there were rips in lace on white top. Returned. Ordered again hoping it was a one time problem. Nope. The second order the black top had rips in the lace. Returning this order also. Very disappointed.
1.0,very  cheap look!
1.0,It’s very misleading & unhonest for it to say hypoallergenic as within a half hour of wearing it my belly button swelled up & became extremely irritated & painful. I’m very allergic to nickel. There is definitely without a doubt nickel in this product. Uuugh it looked sooo cute but it hurt sooo bad!
1.0,"I read the negative reviews but thought, ""Meh, I'll trust the positives.""  The produce fell apart the first time I tried to put it on.  HEED THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS."
1.0,To awkward to easily use!
1.0,Fabric too thin.  I will be returning this.
1.0,These are considered hate pins by the school so my grandson had to quit wearing them.
1.0,Dress material was cheap. Rode up underneath
1.0,Took four weeks to be delivered and runs way too small. Not worth time and effort ordering and waiting.Very disappointed
1.0,"Way too large, the inserts shift. Would not recommend."
1.0,"I normally wear a medium in shirts.  I ordered a large, sent it back and ordered an extra large.  It's still snug."
1.0,This is cheap. I thought maybe just maybe it wouldn’t be too bad. If you even pull on these buckles they will break. It’s more of a one or two time use item don’t expect to get more out of it.
1.0,Understatement of the year.<br /><br />Small as in minuscule. Seriously do not order this. Quality is crap. Looks like it would fit a teddy bear. Feels like a used wash cloth. The picture they used is a total exaggeration.<br /><br />I gave it to my coworker for her 6 yr old niece.
1.0,I was not expecting much with buying a 100$ wedding dress online which was fine the fabric was nice but did not fit so wanted to return. When trying to get a shipping label they wanted me to keep the dress and only give me a $30 credit. I was not ok with this then they offered $50 credit still I wanted a full refund. They sent me a label to only find out would cost me $60 to ship back. Was very unhappy
1.0,"I am so disappointed dress looks nothing like what picture shows. I ordered a small could fit a 3 or 400lb person. Or would probably be great for a siamese twin, i bought a small. I hate it waste of money. Dress looks like a big box doesn't even go off shoulder. Horrible buy. Wish i could rate this lower than no stars"
1.0,It is fraying and falls off a lot 😫
1.0,The design of these shorts is NOT what was expected
1.0,"Horrible! The design itself is cute which is why I bought it, I bought a XL and it fits more like a medium. On top of it being obnoxiously small its also very short and barely any stretch."
1.0,"Shirt was too too too small. Normally I can wear a large, I couldn’t fit this one over my chest. I gave it to my son since he wears a small to medium"
1.0,"Too thin, extremely cheap clasp and harware, doesn't lay flat. Absolutely cannot wear."
1.0,The waistband is terrible and uncomfortable
1.0,Started to rust/oxidize a week after using.
1.0,This wad bought for a 10 yr old. It's too big in the waist and should be advertised as adult size.  There are 2 sides of the skirt that are totally missing all the stars. It is not gold it is more of a yellow orange color.
1.0,"It stinks of burnt chemicals. It's too large, and it's stained brown. Not worth the time and money. It's like as if they printed this thing out in a filthy house somewhere in Eastern Asia then put it in a plastic pack. It also costs almost as same amount of money as itself to return it. I threw mine away in the trash."
1.0,"I am not pleased with this product. It is very beautiful, but I had beads falling off everywhere, even before I tried it on. I had to tie loose ends that were not secured properly to avoid every bead from unraveling completely.  The slip underneath was shedding black material everywhere, and the beads sewn on the rear seem very uncomfortable to sit on. The zipper was very poor quality and hard to zip up.  Overall, I'm very disappointed in my purchase and probably will return it and not wear it to my party now. :("
1.0,I love the color and design off this dress but the sleeves are way too short. It looks odd. In order to wear this I’ll have to push the sleeves up to my elbows. It’s also slightly smaller than I expected.
1.0,The glass fell off the face of watch on one the first one the replacement the glass cracked and this is the third one and now the back case has fallen off and you can’t get back on the company was great about the return and replacement but just not a sturdy product for men and I need a refund on this one cause need to send back
1.0,Only single layer frabic not protective against the covid-19
1.0,Temple broke. Haven't worn them for an hour total.
1.0,"Nice idea, but in practice, terrible. A thin, inflexible plastic cable on your  glasses, much like a wire clothes hanger. What's not to like??"
1.0,They were HUGE! And i usually have the issue that sunglasses look too big on me. Not a fan of these.
1.0,The color was good the fit was awful.. best to avoid all together.top way to small and bottoms way to big. No happy medium
1.0,I have another pair that I bought while in Hawaii and they aren't as bulky as these. Way to big and not delicate. Too chunky and they look funny when I wear them. I'd return them but they were a gift.
1.0,"Fellow boyfriends, be a real one and spend some money on quality. Contemplating on even giving this to my girlfriend, when even I can see how badly cheap this is. Haha"
1.0,I bought it for my Iceland trip. Fit well. Too thin and did not keep me warm. NOT Waterproof.
1.0,They are simply too small to wear.
1.0,Cheap material... Looks nothing like the product picture. color of bow is different than dress. Product came torn aswell. Only good thing is size fit according to chart.
1.0,Nothing against Chinese alphabets but I do not what they say and they look so oddly placed. Also color is darker that what it shows. Returning soon.
1.0,"One ball was broken right out of the package. Then when I took it out and grabbed the other ball to unscrew it, it snapped right off. Terrible. I'm returning it for a refund."
1.0,"The fit, compression, strap length, and strap width were perfect. I loved this durag except for one thing...it bled all over everything! I had black dye on my t-shirts, hands, and it turned a towel I had on my pillow black!! I tried soaking it in salt and vinegar for 24 hours and it still bled after that."
1.0,"They fall off way to easy, the back is to flimsy to keep them on the crocs. My daughter loved them until they started disappearing. She has lost most of them."
1.0,Breaks very easy!!!
1.0,Poor quality product and wrong fit
1.0,They were supposed to be half in silver  and a half and gold they were mostly in the server and I make gold jewelry
1.0,I think these were mismarked and are really boys because they choke my junk.  These are so small and I really want to send them back if they will take them.
1.0,"I ordered this in XL which is the size I always wear. The item said True to Size so it should have fit, but it didn't. It was more like a Medium with sleeves that only came three quarters of the way down my arm instead of to my wrist like normal sleeves. The fabric was very cheap and thin."
1.0,Not what was described when i made the purchase.
1.0,Very short and tight in the shoulders! If you are petite I'm sure it would be perfect. I'm 5'7 and it was a tunic. And pulled across my shoulders.
1.0,poor chain quality .broke within a couple of weeks of using it
1.0,It was not even the shirt let alone the same size
1.0,This was the worst tasting TVP I've ever had. Truly awful. I threw then entire bag away.
1.0,"Absolutely Positively w/out an inkling of a Doubt not what it says, will never buy this product again ever."
1.0,I loved the shirt until I washed it and it shrunk up so much that it is a crop top. I literally just threw it away. Don't buy!!!
1.0,Smaller in size
1.0,I was so excited to use these for my toddler after reading the reviews but unfortunately they were Not waterproof or leakproof AT ALL! Was very disappointed with how cheap the material was.
1.0,"I ordered a 3XL and it was at least 2 sizes too small.  I'm 6'-4"" and the size wasnt even close."
1.0,Not what I was expecting :(
1.0,I don't remember buying this bracelet
1.0,"A gift for a friend and within 5 minutes and one sip of beer later the hinge broke, then when tacking it off the loop for the belt snapped off."
1.0,"Just tossed into a bag; very poorly packaged.  No instructions, no pins, missing pieces.  Don't waste your time and money."
1.0,The band broke after a few weeks.
1.0,"This necklace took way too long to deliver and when I got it, it was completely broken apart into 1 million pieces. I didn’t look anything like the photo. All the attachment pieces were bent and broken. It is not a sturdy necklace. Obviously I never even got to wear it."
1.0,This is pictured as off one shoulder but the actual shirt is not. It is a standard tshirt. Disappointed
1.0,"Took almost a month to arrive.  The material of this shirt seems thinner, cheaper than what I received before.  The pearl button to secure the back has been replaced by a regular button which promptly fell off while fastening it!  Incredibly tight underarm and chest area.  I'm going to return.  Would not recommend."
1.0,"I didn't even receive the ring pictured, and broke within hours."
1.0,"This coat runs very small. Also it's not a wool blend, it's a cotton blend. It's made out of sweatshirt material. The shop it came from won't even take it back. I've never been disappointed in an Amazon purchase until now."
1.0,The first time I received this dress it had a rip going straight down the back seam. I returned it and decided to order another because it was cute. Even though I was telling myself don’t bother because it’s was such cheap material. I went ahead and got another. Got the second one and it was torn in the back where both straps connect to the dress.
1.0,These don't come close to fitting. Waste of money. Don't buy.
1.0,"The back latch broke before I ever put it on, very cheaply made, but that goes with out saying, because it was cheap to buy."
1.0,The garment looked nothing like the picture.  Very disappointing.
1.0,The leg holes on some of the pairs are to large/don’t have enough elastic causing the underwear to ride up my sons butt and back and leave his private completely uncovered...it wasn’t all pairs but most.
1.0,Awful. Hasn't worked since first week. Tried to get it to work after charging time and again but it just doesn't work like it did that first week. So of course im 8 days past the return window. Waste of my money.
1.0,"I ordered this product in June 2021 and 1 of the 4 Quick Release Links was defective. Amazon replaced the item in July and then in August, I noticed that I had lost half of my Keys because one of the Quick Release Links fell apart while I was driving my SUV. Thank God that the Keys landed on the floor of my car and didn't fall off outdoors.  Needless to say, I returned the second set and received a full refund.<br /><br />To be fair, this is a 8 piece set consisting of 2 different items - 4 Quick Release Links"" and 4 Stainless Steel Cables.  The 4 Stainless Steel Cables appear to be of excellent quality."
1.0,Not a good silk quality.
1.0,This item did not meet my expectations
1.0,You can’t read writing
1.0,"The strap is made of silicone not rubber as advertised. It attracts lint, dust, and hair like a magnet. In fact, when I opened the package the manufacturer was nice enough to include hair on the strap."
1.0,I've already submitted a Review!!!!
1.0,"This ring is a literally hollow, poorly made forgery.  It does not have the maker's mark of Alchemy of England and bears multiple, glaring flaws."
1.0,"Reviews hold true, this wallet has broken twice within a 4 period month. The mechanism will start to fail on you before the small plastic piece holding it all together breaks."
1.0,Ordered a men's XL and these would barely be a medium.
1.0,Not a good one... The quality of the shoes is really poor and the fit is not that good. Really flimsy material which feels like it will tear in 1/2 use.
1.0,"Not what I expected...  Even though the necklace wasn’t expensive, I didn’t think the settings would be plastic.  The information about the necklace should have said “silver colored,” not “silver.”  I thought it would be silver plated.  The packaging was very nice, however, but I was disappointed overall, since I won’t be able to use the set as I intended."
1.0,Ring is true to picture but beware. Bought this for my husband he dropped it and the band broke. Tungsten I don’t think so.
1.0,"Los realizan muy mal son todos deforme. Nada parecido a la imagen, trae error de fábrica. Lo compré y lo devolví pero el que me enviaron por reemplazo estaba peor que el anterior. No vale la pena"
1.0,"The outer part of the boots completely disintegrated within a few hours of first wearing them. I wore these to work where I sit at a desk, so absolutely no heavy wear involved. The boots felt fine, so I was shocked when I noticed the outer layer crumbling with pieces falling off. Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,"Bought this for my 2019 GMC Yukon. The ring is too wide and won’t fit the key for this generation vehicle. Further, the key chain easily comes apart when you pull it. This is not a great design if you plan on keeping it in a handbag and may need to pull it out from something where it could get caught (your keys might go flying). Therefore, not the best design."
1.0,"Was very excited to wear at a party. Fit was great, but as I was just about to walk out the door, the zipper split...very poorly made. Disappointed."
1.0,Sizing is way off. Way smaller than what they claim.
1.0,The ends don’t match nor fit my watch.
1.0,Product was trash! Ripped as well.
1.0,"Threw them away!!  Thin, itchy... I can't even!!"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:199ea46e99ce9717f43c348405fca61b]] Mal producto se despinta fácilmente no lo recomiendo
1.0,The ankle strap is too loose making them feel like flip flops. They wouldn't take it back for a full refund.
1.0,It is completely open on the front. Nothing to cover chest. Not as pictured
1.0,This dress looked like a garbage bad and the fabric looked cheap
1.0,"I was expecting a more textured/ molded 3D look. It is  just flat, like a printed out picture. It’s still cute but the photo is misleading. My daughter bought this for her sisters birthday so no time to return."
1.0,Very small.  Do not like it
1.0,a poor quality
1.0,Unwrapped for Christmas Eve and the top part ripped on one half before it was even tried on. You can see on the other half it is about to rip as well.
1.0,"They are absolutely NOT clear. They're solid white. Someone will notice them standing 5 feet away from you. If you're planning on wearing them for school or work, choose something else. I have a medium skin tone and this stuck out like a sore thumb. When I got the package, they were bent out of shape and I had to straighten them. Aside from that, they're useless and extremely hard to put in. It took me over an hour to put it in. Would not recommend to anyone."
1.0,Definitely not straight leg pants. They are huge on me. Ordered a large even though I wear mediums because the last pair I bought were very cute but the mediums I ordered were too small.
1.0,WASTE OF MONEY! I bought this for my mom and she got a green ring around her finger.....not okay.
1.0,Too hard to grasp straps together thus making band easy to come apart and possibly lose expensive watch.
1.0,Literally the earrings came to me broken
1.0,Over half of them were bent and broken. I could only partially use 3 of them. They were also 2 days late.
1.0,Just normal tanks
1.0,bungee clip does not stay in place
1.0,I emailed the company with what to put on the bracelet and ended up with the generic Ohana bracelet. I am upset by this.<br />Update: After sending an email with a complaint. They responded after 3 months to finally fix the problem. I have since received the correct bracelet but it took 4 months after I originally ordered.
1.0,"Poorly made. The center strip is not centered, so it doesn't fit and unwearable."
1.0,"I was surprised how cheaply it was made. It broke almost immediately, so disappointed!"
1.0,Was totally different than the picture came with half of the strings and stuff hanging off of it
1.0,Straight trash wrong size  pattern was crappy  threw it awayb
1.0,Don’t like them to small
1.0,THE DRESS WAS LOVELY BUT SIZE ARE NOT TRUE
1.0,very disapointed! no return and refund policy. I stuck with this product.
1.0,This looks fake to me! Beard straighter has all tennis shoe reviews! Do not buy!
1.0,"The chain on one came broken and both chains are VERY SHARP to the skin, they are different lengths one can get over the head which I like the best thing is the stones, but they’re VERY DIFFERENT one CHUNK and ROUNDED and one FLAT on  ONE SIDE and finished on the OTHER SIDE. IT IS A HOT MESS, AND I WILL NEVER GET THE TIME BACK THAT IT TOOK TO WRITE THIS REVIEW.  JUST KNOW IF U BUY THIS BE READY TO BUY A NEW CORD.  PLEASE FORGIVE ME BECAUSE I BUY AND DO NOT BUY BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS, I AM DISABLED AND 74 years old, it isn’t a good day for me……Love"
1.0,The dress is over sized too much fabric and is not the same as the picture. The lace material goes all the way around the dress and there is no belt/tie in the front as pictured. I had to make alterations to save the dress. Size down. I took measurements and it was too large. Will take pictures and upload.
1.0,"Chain broke on the first bottle. The bottle open sucks, I use the skulls teeth to open bottles like a lighter."
1.0,Not a child's small. More lIke an adult medium. Poorly sized.
1.0,"Junk, the frames don't last. If you get a months wear out of them your lucky."
1.0,"Ordered the white with blue flowers, tried it on and sent it back after I discovered it was completely see-through in daylight or under any particular light for that matter, even when wearing white under clothes . Also, the length was a bit short for my taste, I couldn't bend or even lean over, without someone seeing my underwear . Shame, cause it was super cute ."
1.0,I have tried to return the product twice due to the gem falling off as soon as my daughter put it on.  The label has been printed but the ups/FedEx guy never showed both times.  I'm more than upset as I believe now it's been too long to return.
1.0,I bought this watch band for my Gear S3 and adjusted it to fit my wrist. I was very happy with it until the clasp lock rivet mechanism just broke loose and now the watch band clasp can't lock any longer. Cheap build did not last long! Wasted money. Now I need a new watch band. I took a picture to show where the clasp locking rivet broke off from.
1.0,"disgusting! Didn’t even get a chance to take a photo, packed it right back and returned it! material BAD, Color SUPER OFF, IT TOOK SO LONG TO GET HERE! it fits like a doctors 🥼. Oh no! Save your time and money because it’s not so cheap either."
1.0,I would give it ZERO stars if I could. Horrible purchase! Don't get taken advantage of like this!!
1.0,I don’t like poor quality.
1.0,This is the crappiest flag I’ve ever seen - it is cheaply made and there is no way it will last a summer without serious fading. Do not order.
1.0,Looks cheaper than I expected.
1.0,Pesimmo nada q ver con la foto Malisimo material
1.0,"Horrible product don't waste your $..took them out of the package and they are falling apart as I'm trying to put them on my daughter, Very very poorly made."
1.0,"It feels really cheap, it doesn't want to sit in my ear either. And the end of the tail doesn't want to close so the needle just ends up sticking out without a back because it won't go on."
1.0,The stitching on the ruffle is very cheap looking. Fabric is polyester and thin. Sent it back.
1.0,"Sooooo upset!!! Don't order, beware!!! Not like the picture at all!!! Super faded!!! This was supose to be a Christmas gift instead a waste of money!!!!"
1.0,"I like the watch.  The hands are the same color as the interior of the watch, thus are a little difficult to read, and thus minus 1 star.<br /><br />After a month the watch can no longer keep time.  It consistently loses time at a rate of at least one minute per hour.  It is barely functional and no longer useful for its sole purpose, to keep time, thus minus 3 more stars."
1.0,Hate it!!! it came loose after a week of wearing it.!!!
1.0,Way too small! Might fit a toddler.
1.0,This product was too big and low quality.
1.0,Battery and design is the worst part.
1.0,Zipper broke on second use.
1.0,I have worn this for less than 2 weeks and it is already tarnishing/turned black in some areas. There is no way this belly button ring is actually decently &#34;gold-plated.&#34; Very Disappointed.
1.0,This is kate spade not coach
1.0,"***** WARNING *****  I used one of these and it was very hard to breath. So WARNING you pay $32.99 for the 3 masks and when you have to return them instead of asking the customer to pay the shipping you charge $19.99 to return it which is a rip off, for me to print the label and buy the package to return on top of it. When I could pay to return it for 1/4 of the cost!!!!!!  So now I am out of my money and purchased a product that I can not even use and isn't worth me sending back due to the cost."
1.0,"The shrink with the wash, fit super tight and don’t give you much back support, I only got c cups and this does absolutely nothing for me, the won’t accept returns now either... don’t bother buying"
1.0,Hated the fabric....not a flattering fit at all
1.0,"The hands on the watch WOULD NOT STAY STILL.  As soon as I received it I tried to set the time and it would not stay still, it just spun around.  I think that it was very loose.  DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1.0,Took so long to get here and then it didn’t fit properly. Too irritated to even try to return item.
1.0,"Runs way too small, size up at least 2 sizes"
1.0,"Huge, not wearable"
1.0,I ordered these bands and it had 2 black bands instead of one light pink. That's  why I order these. They didn't come with pins and did not even fit my watch!!!! These bands suck!!! Read the reviews and don't waste your time buying these!!
1.0,You might wanna size 2 up
1.0,Crap fabrics
1.0,After wearing less than a week the<br />Chains turned a copper color and the pendant turned silver. Can’t even be worn anymore since they’re completely different colors.
1.0,"Color is nothing like pictured. Light swamp water green,  not the brilliant green advertised.<br />The gems are soldered crooked as well.  Not the quality I had hoped for with the price I  paid."
1.0,"this broke after only a week due to poor quality or product and a terrible design  - I would not recommend it as there as many other, better options"
1.0,Super small for my adult face.
1.0,Received broken and unwearable.
1.0,I ordered a Large & it fit like a small.  Returning today!
1.0,I ordered 3 for customers of mine and so far 2 out of the 3 have broke. They look really nice but are not good quality.
1.0,These earring were cute but the posts were too big for my ears and the back fit so tightly I could barely get them on and off. I even tried to replace the backs but regular earring backs didn't fit these. I returned them.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:1ef9d08f4ee36f559552213888c3227]] We couldn’t even try it on. The chain on the cape is broken, making it unusable VERY DISAPPOINTING. I ope I can find a replacement in time."
1.0,The only difference in glare was the glasses made it yellow instead of white.<br /> I would give it NO stars if possible as there is nothing good to say about this product<br />and do not work as advertised.
1.0,"I ordered these specifically for the ""Anti Reflection"" quality, so that when I am in an online meeting on my desktop computer, the lenses do not reflect the screen back so that my eyes are hidden from my e-companions, as these do, (I have screen shots and snarky remarks to support this).<br />These are clearly blue-blocking, and, if you saw me in a Zoom screenshot when I was looking at a mostly white screen, these glasses are mostly reflecting blue light (which, after all, makes sense for blue-blocking lenses but  not ""Anti Reflection"" ones).<br />They are fine for my solo reading, but that's not why I chose them. I also know they are inexpensive, but I wouldn't have spent the money on these at all if not for the term ""Anti Reflection""."
1.0,"I would send them back but their imported and didn't have a return address, don't really like them"
1.0,Way too gaudy looking. Did not like at all.
1.0,"Opened box and they were very broken, missing lens cracked frame etc. appears to gage been done prior to shipping as box was not at all damaged and it was wrapped in tissue paper"
1.0,"What looked like large red dangling earrings were actually very very tiny. So disappointing, since the outfit I thought screamed for those exact earrings, will have to stop screaming. Ah well, still on the look out for the right pair."
1.0,These are not kids masks as advertised. These will fit an adult and hung off my children.
1.0,"These are definitely Asian sizing.  It is tiny, tiny.  If you are anywhere between 14-20 in US sizing don't even bother ordering this.  Even the largest one will be too small.  Additionally, I tried to get a return and my request was completely ignored.  I'm going to have to find and Asian friend to give this to.  lol"
1.0,Ugly.  Cheaply made.  Zippers don’t work well.
1.0,Super cheap fabric. Don’t buy.
1.0,"This is a cheap watch and is not water proof or water resistant as described. I had my watch on in the pool, it obviously<br />had moisture in it after swimming and then stopped working. It is not worth the money. It looks nice initially but is made cheap. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!"
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture on the website plus it is a slim fit which did not describe anywhere online.
1.0,"Very unflattering.  I'm fairly thin and this literally stuck straight out at my hips,  like two huge triangles."
1.0,First the clip-ons were to short to attach to my glasses.<br />Second I received three dark grey clip-ons instead of the three different colors.<br />I returned them to the shipper with a note.  Will I get a refund?
1.0,This ring was a complete disappointment! It came tarnished black with no hint of a fire in the stone. Really disappointed in the items I've received from Amazon lately.
1.0,"The first time I wore these earrings, the part that goes in your ear bent a little, so I had to be careful. After the 4th time the part just broke off. I have never had this problem with earrings, not even .99 cent earnings."
1.0,"The fabric isn’t comfy, it almost feels like I’m wearing a bag. It’s very uncomfortable."
1.0,"This product is junk. I’m a regular Large size and ordered L. The item arrived 5XL, its like a bag. Also, the seller is not willing to respond your messages nor refund it. I had to open a claim through amazon to be able to get my money back."
1.0,They were not supportive at all. They were so slippery that I almost fell multiple times. They were larger than size but pour quality all around. Worst purchase I have ever made!
1.0,I was told garanteed delivery by tuesday and it came wednesday because of a &#34;delay&#34;. Getting a draft board a day after your draft is fun...
1.0,I didn't know this had a draw string through it. The hole is unfinished. This shirt seemed smaller than all the other caftan shirts I've owned. Took over a month to arrive. Beautiful color.... wish it would have worked  :(
1.0,"The fabric is great, color and style wonderful. I’m a regular size L, I ordered a 2XL and it’s like a fitted spandex top small size. I gave mine to goodwill. I ordered 3 similar, all will get the exact same review. If you are plus size keep shopping."
1.0,Did not look right
1.0,Did like it looked nothing like the picture
1.0,"I ordered two bands, one for both my husband and myself.  My husband's band broke after three days and my band broke after four days.  Very poor quality."
1.0,"Dislike strongly, absolute crap compared to what ordered, threw it to a dog for a chew rag."
1.0,"Would not recommend purchasing unless for a swimsuit cover up. I', 5'4"" and it was too short on me."
1.0,"On the second wear,  these ripped along the seam. They weren't tight, they fit perfectly. I'd like to replace them but it's not giving me the option."
1.0,Runs way way bigger than you expect
1.0,"If I could I would give it a lower star! I ordered a plus size suit and when it came it , it was 4 sizes smaller. My 13 yr old sister wears a size medium/large and the bottoms were tight on her too!"
1.0,"I only wore this product twice before it started falling apart. First, the small holes started ripping.  Second, the wires started popping out. I wore one out and was embarrassed because I had to pull the whole wire out."
1.0,This watch broke the second time I wore it.
1.0,Considering return.
1.0,I have owned this belt for about a month and it has started to come apart.  It looks great and all other aspects of the purchase were as described.
1.0,Pedi mi talla large y parece mediana
1.0,"ten ""clown noses"" made of open-cell foam ball and slashed randomly with a blade so the cuts weren't even centered in the balls, crammed into a box so they were all squished out of shape. I was expecting something with a smooth surface shaped to grip the nose. I guess if you are having a kid's birthday party they would at least be able to stay on the kids' noses for a few minutes of fun, then into the trash with the rest of the cleanup."
1.0,"The description reads that it is leather, but it does not look like it.  The quality overall, and look is cheap."
1.0,"Great price, poor quality I had torn seams after wearing it twice.. seems it got way loose as you wear it.. very disappointed"
1.0,Awful dress. terrible costume-like material - looks slutty and tacky not cute and flirty.
1.0,"Recently ordered dusty blue color. Manufacturer either uses different fabric for different colors, or they have changed the fabric altogether. I have ordered this brand before and loved them--bought in many colors. HOWEVER, this time the fabric was completely different. After ONE SINGLE wear, the cardigan was pilled all over. The picture I included doesn't even do it justice. There were literal pill balls hanging off my arms! Not attractive!"
1.0,It’s orange! The damn stripes are orange. I thought it was red!
1.0,The link push out tool broke the frist time i tryed to push a link out and the put out pin bent couldent even use the band i had to use a diffrent one do not buy i whould give 0 star but i cant.
1.0,The fabric is awful.  Stiff and crunchy.  Returned it.
1.0,"It's not soft, very stiff.  I can't believe Lulu made this!  Not a great quality product at all.  It's so uncomfortable I never even wear it."
1.0,The shirts are paper thin.  They were supposed to be 3 gray and one black - they are all black and the picture shows a sleeveless t instead they have an elongated arm hole with rough stitching. And this is what I waited 14 extra days for!  What a waste of time and money.
1.0,The strap on both hats broke when I put them on.  Very cheaply made.  I am sending them back.
1.0,"Really strange fit, I should have listened to the other reviews. It's hard to even explain, but it's a really poor quality suit. Even with it being white, you could basically see all the way through the thin white bottoms as soon as I tried them on. Will be returning for hopefully a full refund"
1.0,BEAUTIFUL dress but waaaaaaaaaayyyy too small. I was actually soo bumbed it was so small. I wish I could have one my size.
1.0,Too tiny to huke up to the chain
1.0,These shoes have fallen completely apart. The sole has come off the first time she wore them!!!
1.0,I was greatly dissapointed in these earrings.  They are super tiny and look like I got them out of a nickel bubblegum machine.  Please don't waste your money.
1.0,"I wasn’t impressed. Extremely clunky and an enormous bottom with a cheap cardboard insert. The rest of it, zippers working, space and the rest was fine. The color was great, but the zippers were very large and made the bag clunky and heavy. I returned it."
1.0,The shaft if too thick. It's bigger than my ear hole.  Hurts bad.
1.0,The sizing on this product was ridiculous.  I am not sure if they used the same measurements as the other companies to define small medium and large.  Usually a large is a bit tight on me.  Each shoulder had at least a spare two inches and the chest had an extra five.  I was swimming in it.
1.0,I was super bummed I only received 1 pair of capris when I purchased a set of 3.
1.0,Fits tighter than I like especially around the hips 😩
1.0,"Beautiful, but after three days I had to take them out. The material must be low grade. They made my nipples hurt."
1.0,Broken when they arrived!
1.0,It was broken when we received it and would've been too small anyway
1.0,Not for women with curves...
1.0,"I usually wear a medium and for an xl wasn’t even close to fitting, also kept saying running late and took multiple weeks to get"
1.0,"These run very small, would recommend ordering 2 sizes bigger. Also the soles are supposed to be stitched front and back...they were NOT."
1.0,Not what it appears very cheap
1.0,"Terribly small and plain, especially the plain part. A very explicit lesson in what you see in the picture compared to what you get in real life is quite different. Don't buy this, you will be disappointed."
1.0,They were delivered with a stain on them
1.0,Very Poor quality and arrived smashed . No shape . Knock off hat.
1.0,"TOO SMALL, no really too small. You're in love with the embroidery- yes the embroidery turned out very beautiful for a dress just 70.00. Their size chart is closer to XXL: US 10-12, XL: US 8, L: 6  etc. Read and heed the other reviews."
1.0,Terribly thin for the price and kind of a pain to return.
1.0,I was a little upset that it had a hole immediately in the pants and that is how they came I bought two pair the other pair is fine it’s nice and soft it fits good I’m just a little sad and wondering about the stitching now and if the other one is going to be just as easy to be ripped
1.0,This dress is very poorly designed.  It’s for someone with boobs super high and close together.  The neckline is too high and not proportioned as pictured.  Unwearable
1.0,"The mechanic that attaches the ring with the key chain broke 9 months after receiving it. I didn't put it under any abnormal stress, it was just on my keys carried in pocket.<br /><br />One day it just broke apart and I lost one of my keys. Great!"
1.0,I love the design but it's was at to small. I bought xxl and I usually wear L seems more like it's for boys not adult I have to return them.
1.0,This was so cheaply made and looked like a child’s play necklace but I should have known that for the price I paid for it.
1.0,Within 2 weeks and 4 days of wear the watch completely stopped. I am majorly bummed because I wanted a decent looking pocket watch but should have realized that this price to look was too good to be true
1.0,Made horrible it was to big and to small at the same time
1.0,"Bought this to match a dress for a wedding. I went to my piercing shop to put in, and it really looked cute- but the next day, 10 hours later, I was at my desk and felt something fall onto my shirt. It was the whole top of stud leaving me with a tiny sharp piece of metal in my nose! Terrible quality!"
1.0,They fell apart within a couple weeks
1.0,"Wonderful backs. Stay tight.<br /><br />Edit: I loved these so I bought a second pair. Well, this morning when I got out of the shower my diamond stud fell to the floor. I was just lucky it did not go down the drain. I am not sure what happened or where the back is. I never found it. Not happy. Now I am not sure I trust them any longer."
1.0,Was very disappointed to only receive the silver colored one. Be aware.
1.0,Scam....comes from Asia.
1.0,Turned finger green in a day. Save your money
1.0,"The socks are quite nice - pretty thin but very comfortable.  I ordered the socks to fit shoe size 5-10; however although the sticker pasted on the package said 5-10, the package itself said size 8-12 and sure enough -- they were too large -- false advertising - too bad"
1.0,"this bad is ugly and cheap, simply put."
1.0,"First of all, the items received were not the items pictured.  The material of the items received is cheap almost paper thin.  Second, it does not stay in the position it needs to be to actually catch the hair that's falling.  Very frustrating.  And they send two of them??? Useless.  I would much rather pay a few dollars more for ONE that actually works.  I'm returning them.  Waste of my time and the long wait for them."
1.0,"Wore twice and is unwearable now. I belted the waist and now pilling is happening around the waist and under the arm. At first, it was very nice and soft but the pulling ruins it. Sad!"
1.0,"Looked great, easy to pop on. After 1 week, the rubber fell apart."
1.0,Misleading Description
1.0,Haven't even been able to wear any of these items. Ordered XL and all 3 shirts are way too small. They are closer to a medium in size before washed. My chest will never be small enough to fit in these without looking like a hooker! Not happy at all.
1.0,Wholes were too small for metal on buckle to go though. I tried to make it bigger and metal on buckle came off. Cheaply made.
1.0,"This looks more t-shirt like in the picture. In reality. It's more dress, it doesn't have a raised hem at the hips. Not is it fitted. It's more a line"
1.0,The dress fit but wasn’t eye appealing at all! The fabric was weird...
1.0,The latch broke the second time I wore it.
1.0,"Though the product LOOKS like it does in the photos, it's poorly made. It's a very thin piece of fabric with, like, a loose piece of fabric on the inside so at least the color of your nip don't show, because you can't wear a bra with it... even a strapless one, because ever detail is extremely obvious. I'm 5'4, 132lbs measurements of 32, 26, 36. I ordered a small and it's still super big and baggy on me. It didn't fit at all like it did the models."
1.0,"Terrible looking, too short, looks like  a shirt, the material had an odor"
1.0,Don't get spend that extra ten lol
1.0,"My son wore these 2 times and the whole top elastic started unraveling. For the price, this shouldn't be happening."
1.0,You get what you pay for. Probably $ 0.99. That's what it's worth..paid 0.33 so I guess I got a deal..lol.. Cheap cheap cheap..mine looks nothing like the ones in the review..buyer beware
1.0,"Fit was off, tight in spots. Loose in other spots. Material was not denim."
1.0,They claim the glasses are unbreakable...they broke.
1.0,Worst article of clothing I've ever purchased!
1.0,"I initially liked these pants with some reservations.  However, after washing gently for the second time, I found a hole in the seam and a long stream hanging out, loose.  These did not split -- they fitted loosely.  But the quality is so poor that bad sewing, which was not obvious at first, makes these a poor choice.  I've sewn up the pants but don't know where the thread will come out again, and I don't think I should have to repair pants after two washings on the delicate cycle.  Below is my original review:<br /><br />First of all, ignore the ""Terry"" in the product title and pay attention to the 100% polyester in the description.  Polyester is far from my favorite fabric, but I  do like these pants.  They seem to run a bit large, but I think they are cute.  Apparently, a lot of other people do not, but that's a matter of personal preference.  I was afraid they would be too hot, but because they are loose around the legs, so far they are working fine.  There are pockets made of lining fabric, not very deep but still handy for small, light objects.<br /><br />These are NOT workout/jogging pants, and anyone who gets them for that reason will be very disappointed.<br /><br />Also, they are supposed to be ""capri.""  They actually are longer than the top of my foot, but I'm 5'3"".  I think you'd have to be pretty tall for them to be capri length.<br /><br />If you like these despite the misrepresentation, be sure you comparison shop.  At the current listing, they do not seem like a good value to me."
1.0,this is a big let down - it was sized horribly wrong!<br /><br />I bought it to wear for a theme day I gym and the medium fits my 225 pound husband!<br /><br />Not nice material - not a good fit. Waste of money  - I wish I could return.
1.0,"Disappointed  - bought 2 sets of these sock one set for each of my kids.  They've worn them several times in both cold temps, and below zero temps  - the socks did not keep their feet any warmer than wearing 2 pairs of regular socks,  Don't waste your money on these."
1.0,The item did not fit as expected. I returned the item.
1.0,"The inside layer and outside all sew together, damaged product, cheap material, bad sewing ,already returned , will not recommend it to anyone. Do not buy it"
1.0,"First pair became unglued after 3 days. So We exchanged them. Unfortunately second pair also came unglued on the sides and fell apart after less than a week of lite use. Sad, as we really like the design."
1.0,Most broke trying to open to put them on ....or they wouldnt open at all
1.0,ZERO STARS! Horrible product & even worse customer service. The dress is super see thru and tight in all the wrong places. Been trying to return it for weeks! Don’t waste your time or money. Do not buy from this person. Absolutely awful!
1.0,The part that sits between your two toes is very bulky and uncomfortable. I can't stand to take two steps with them on. I don't see myself ever wearing these.
1.0,Had to wait months. Then we’re not cut right. Cut in at the waist band.<br />Now I have to Pay postage to return them.<br />Never will buy from them again!
1.0,LOOKS LIKE A BLANKET
1.0,The lenses are here
1.0,"I ordered the Hot Pink tie, thinking it would look like the picture and actually be hot pink.  It is not.  It’s like a red burgundy color.  I ordered two of them, both have stickers on them that say “Hot pink” but they definitely are not.  Very disappointed and will be returning."
1.0,Too small and too short and too tight at waist. The XL seems like a small.
1.0,XL ?  I GIVED IT TO MY GIRL FRIEND SHE WEAR SIZE 8-10.. VERY MISLEADING
1.0,It says one size fits all and I could barely get my not very big hands in them and threw them out.  Do not waste your money
1.0,This is China crap...not happy with purchase at all. Way to small even ordered a size lagerer like suggested still to small and the lining in them is as stiff as a board and not cotton or comfortable.
1.0,"My husband used these waders twice. The second time, his lower leg was soaked because a seam was not sealed properly. We are outside the return window so we're stuck with leaking waders."
1.0,"When it says 3/6 pack, I’m expecting more than one. However I only received one. Quality isn’t bad, but not worth the price."
1.0,If I could have put a zero I would! There was NOTHING in the mailing envelope!!!!!!!!!
1.0,ZERO blocking of blue light. Very disappointed!!
1.0,"The product description claimed that there were 6 pair, but I received 3. Would Not have paid 20 for 3 pair of socks."
1.0,The zise was way off.
1.0,"These were poorly made and on top of that, broken when they got here, I WANT MY MONEY BACK."
1.0,"It has been one of the worst experiences of online shopping, please DO NOT buy these shoes, they are the cheapest quality I've ever seen in my whole entire life, the stitching is way off, you can tell who ever stitched that hated his or job in China, you cant stand while wearing for more than 30 min, your whole back will start aching, not to mention the extreme pain your heels will be in.<br />I intentionally bought them 1/2 a size bigger, they were way off, I'm on my deployment as I'm writing this review, they are a waste of time a waste of money a waste of space"
1.0,There was letting on the front in the photo there wasn’t any lettering. And the size wasn’t right either it says 2 x but it wasn’t
1.0,It’s a beautiful setting but this is Not Moissanite. It was tested and tested and failed every time.
1.0,"Straps are soooo long, cheap material. Ended up returning."
1.0,"I had to return this because the button to turn it on broke after 1 use!! The colors are great but customization options are subpar. The glasses basically are held up by the side of your head, not your ears and not your nose. It’s extremely tight on the sides."
1.0,"Do you have a warranty on your product? , I have used the glasses twice and one of the legs has fallen off. I didn’t think was disposable product"
1.0,I expected this to be a sweater but it was more like t-shirt material. Not at all what I expected.
1.0,"It broke after several months of use, don't waste your money with this belt! The whole belt clip just came apart!"
1.0,"Ordered a S but fits like a L/XL - can't wear them. Previously ordered 2 black pair and they are great, so I'm bummed these are different. Also took a few weeks longer than original delivery date to arrive. Contacted customer service but never received a response."
1.0,Head band too tight and crown too tall!
1.0,Too lazy to return
1.0,These are NOT AUTHENTIC! DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"I got the smaller size, and it's still quite massive. So large in fact that I often lose things in it. The interior structure is too shapeless, so heavier items like my iPhone and wallet will fall to the bottom, and then things pile on top, hiding them. BTW, the lining is black so that makes it harder to find things as well. There are too many compartments that don't hold its shape and fold over the contents. I've had to dump everything out in a panic, looking for things like keys, a parking validation slip, passport. God forbid you have something small and dark-colored, that you'd need quickly, like pepper spray. You'll never find it in time to actually use it before it is too late."
1.0,Love the colors but I don’t like that it feels sticky
1.0,Too big. Returned. bought  medium but felt like longer.
1.0,The product is too big.. the suggestion was to go bigger.. but it's a mistake.. I want to return it for a refund. . But it will cost me 50 dollars to ship.. the product is 38 dollars.. so that is my sad story..<br /><br />I'm really sorry for the 1 star review but the product is very big and to return it will cost me a 50 dollars. My wife throw it out already because it's not cost efficient for me since the product is cheaper than returning it.. not sure how to change it to 5 star.. I also know this is your business and I don't want you guys to lose money either in my account.. it's ok.. it is just unfortunate that it did not fit me..
1.0,The band is not worth the hype after two weeks and he glitter started lifting
1.0,"The material used to make this top is extremely uncomfortable and rough, I wouldn't wast my money on something that's just going to be irritating."
1.0,"Not only they are not silk, but they are way too big and don;t work with touchscreen"
1.0,This mask is doing more harm than good. I used only two days and it dried my face out so much. I had more wrinkles at places that I’ve never seen before using this mask. I wish I can return it.
1.0,It's not soft. It doesn't slouch at all. It awkwardly sits on top of your head. Not a good buy.
1.0,not what i ordered at all and nothing like the picture
1.0,"I ordered an xxl and I'm not huge just curvy, and that thing did not fit at all. Gave it to my sister who is tiny tiny and it was snug but it fit. So future buyers be aware, these run crazy small. Order WAY up."
1.0,"The bra fits but the crossover is about two sizes too small, has no stretch and won’t fasten. Had to give it to someone two sizes smaller than me."
1.0,I loved this ring when I got it however it was to thick to wear all pieces so I could only wear the 2. The diamonds are falling out of it. I have only had it since I got married in may and starting wearing it and now this. I need to send it back cuz the diamonds falling out..please help me
1.0,"Too heavy, because of this my granddaughter seldom wears them"
1.0,Do not waste your money.  The velcro in the back does not work well. I close it and it snaps two minutes later...
1.0,One of the stones fell out within 5 minutes. Another within 2 days. Disappointing since my son saved his birthday money to buy this.
1.0,"Item was not as shown on Amazon, was too big, and made of very flimsy cheap material. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"Not as pictured. The picture is a pale blue, the teal earrings are BRIGHT turquoise and green. They are very large and mine came with a missing stone. When I sent the seller a message they seemed unconcerned."
1.0,"These are PLASTIC lenses and the frames are very cheap, flimsy PLASTIC. Nothing nice about them...certainly not worth the price--maybe worth $5. Was expecting higher quality than the TOY glasses I had bought for his Harry Potter costume, but didn't get it--those are actually nicer."
1.0,It barely warms and there is no where to put your thumb. I requested a return/refund and am expected to pay to ship.
1.0,Not recommended the material is to cheap...l don’t like it...
1.0,"Normally I love wrap dresses. The material is awful and irregular. The fit is tremendous, and the way it's cut even if it did fit I wouldn't want the dress. There's a resin why they have the model holding the bottom away from her body."
1.0,"Boyfriend only had for a day. I bought this for him because he likes to collect high quality brushes and durags. He is a very serious waver so I thought it would be nice to buy him a new durag. Arrived yesterday, he wore overnight, and it stretched and left lines. For $20 + 5 for shipping, we expected a HIGH quality product, this is not that. We'll stick with monsoon products."
1.0,The watch band was too large and it was very difficult making the adjustments
1.0,"Sigh , I wanted to love these ... but I had in one for about a day and even though it was screwed in it kept falling out . I put in another one for back up and literally it fell<br />Out as well. Maybe I’m not good with internal three but it sucks I lost two and can’t even return them . Honestly I had them screwed in tight and tested it but after just normal wearing walking around I felt them and they just didn’t stay threaded ."
1.0,"I'm 5'4, 137 lbs, 36B, typically between a medium or large and this one size fits all was pretty huge.  It definitely gave an oversize sweater look which is what I was going for but I gave it 1 star because the material is scratchy!!  Had the material been a nice softer material, I would wear this all the time but it's so scratchy, I just can't get myself to wear it.<br /><br />I've had good experience with ROMWE dresses so I had high expectations for this but unfortunately this material is horrible!  Bummer."
1.0,The zippers came right off so sending right back. Reboundwear told me I could put the shirt on by myself. Read the instructions and this is not true if I am wearing a sling. A caregiver is required to assist with putting it on and taking it off.
1.0,I bought the product as a gift for my friends and they came out to be bigger than expected. The quality is very poor also and you cant even close it. Highly don’t recommend.
1.0,They were paper thin; I will not wear or order again.
1.0,"It’s really cute, but not the same hoodie shown in the picture."
1.0,Not good was broken same date
1.0,Ordered 2X and sleeves were size small. Fringe was not beige but peach colored. Not as expected. Could not even try it on
1.0,Ordered for a teenager. Opened package and was very disappointed to see this sock will barely fit a toddler
1.0,I ordered one navy blue cap with my own photo but instead I received 4 black caps with a photo of a man that I don't know. Very unhappy with this. It took forever to arrive and now I have this.
1.0,"The fabric is terrible. It looks so cheap and gross, never wore it"
1.0,"The socks themselves are nice quality, however they’re lousy to wear with shoes. The sock is too big (I wear 10 in ladies sizes) and it’s bunches up in back when trying to put on a shoe. This leaves you with a sock lump sticking out of the back of your shoe, but don’t worry since as soon as you start walking the socks will work their way down your heels and will end up slipping completely off your feet. Lame."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:71742d3c0d70fd83d3a56219e50a40a6]] DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Out of the whole bag of 100 pair MORE than HALF CAME RIGHT OUT THE PACKAGE WITH HOLES EVERYWHERE ALREADY IN THEM! Already had to throw away every pair worn and unworn, they either come out the package with holes everywhere or as soon as u wear them they end up with holes by the time u take them off. Terribly thin they feel awful on your feet. Definately DO NOT RECOMMEND! WASTE OF $36"
1.0,"Omg. FALSE ADVERTISING! The only word I can think of to describe this jacket, is GROSS. The outside is not Sherpa, it feels like little balls of itchy yarn and it is not attractive. And the inside is not “lined“ either. They literally used windbreaker material. This is the cheapest piece of crap I’ve ever gotten on Amazon. Unfortunately it was given to me as a gift so I am stuck with it, but please do not buy this thing. The photos lie. This is not cute, this is not comfortable, this is not warm, this is absolute garbage."
1.0,The stone simply looks like clear glass.  Has no color to it at all.  It's a disappointment.
1.0,Nothing T-shirt looking about it. Looks more like a smock that a person in a physician's office would wear. Very cheap - no similarity to the picture at all.
1.0,I couldn't even get in it because I couldn't figure out all the slits and the slits really looked like a 1st grader cut them for a school project.
1.0,I returned mine because I couldnt figure out how to wear them.
1.0,"I bought these thinking for the price I couldn't go wrong. Well I did, these came and they were bent, some won't close, just in general they are REALLY CHEAP! Waste of money."
1.0,second hand broke after first use.
1.0,I wanted to love these and material is wonderful but why is the crotch sown almost to my knees! Im 5'2 and ordered a small
1.0,This looked horrible in person. Very cheaply made not worth it
1.0,"way too tight, even for thin woman arms."
1.0,This product is very low quality. I have had it for about 8 months and everything inside of watch has broken. It stopped telling time maybe 6 months into having the watch. I would have liked a return but that is not possible anymore. I would not recommend this brand.
1.0,Zipper broke on the first wear.
1.0,"I purchased for vein ablation. These are so heavy, thick & uncomfortable, I could ripped them off immediately. SO tight in the foot, it caused cramping. I have other 20-30 that are so much better. They may work for some people, but not for me."
1.0,Nice glasses but they broke in half.....and that was being very careful after reading other reviews... They should have some kind of policy knowing they break so easy.. not a happy camper...
1.0,Fit loose cheap material
1.0,"Broke within first 48 hours. However that first 48 it was very comfortable, stylish."
1.0,Not a wide calf boot.
1.0,"I got these glasses and loved the way they looked. I kept them in my purse, in the case that they came in. I only had them for 28 days, and wore them a total of 3 times, before they broke. They didn't experience any trauma, that I was aware of. I took them out of the case, to wear them for time # 4, and a piece of the plastic rim had chipped right off. It was the top inner left corner. I submitted a request for return, no problem. I am usually good about my returns, but this time life got hectic and I didn't get around to it for 12 days. By then, the opportunity to return had passed and I could not print the return label. So, into the garbage they went. I was so bummed. This product is nice in theory but, with only 3 wears for almost $20, I didn't even get what I paid for here. Really disappointed."
1.0,These are just printed material
1.0,These earrings look nothing like the photo. They are so small and mine don't even look silver. They look like a bronze metal. Also one has a slightly larger misshapen black stone than the other. So disappointed and returning them for refund.
1.0,The item arrived broken.
1.0,"Didn't care for the material, way to clingy"
1.0,Sizes are a lot smaller then expected...passed it down to my daughter who is naturally thin and it still was very snug and uncomfortable in a size xl
1.0,Don't buy these ear rings they are not silver. They turned my ears black and a skin reaction. They suck. They made me put a star but they are cheap
1.0,The picture shows 8 beads and it was more than a little vague in the description about how many you would be receiving had I known it was only two I would have purchased something else very disappointed 😥
1.0,Cheap. See through. Trash.
1.0,"Smashed beyond fixing,threw it away"
1.0,"Unfortunately it's difficult to get the hair band on and nearly impossible for it to stay on. The groove isn't deep enough. Also, there is no give so they can't bend at all. They were quite big on me and I would have liked to adjust them."
1.0,"Looks like an odd gross winter moomoo. Entirely unattractive. I wouldn’t even wear as pj’s, returned it."
1.0,Cheaply made for the price disappointed
1.0,The pants are pretty but they do not fit at all.  Not a size2X as listed.
1.0,"At first I was really impressed with these gloves- they’re a nice fit for my small hands and the fleece inside is soft and warm. About a week later, they started falling apart, and didn’t even last through the winter. Don’t waste your money.<br /><br />First, the touch pads don’t work. Fine, whatever, not a deal breaker. About 3 weeks into wearing them to work 4-5 days a week, of the bows/ “leather” straps ripped at the seam as I put them on. I worried that they would look silly with mismatched straps, but the next day the other glove’s strap ripped too. This caused holes to open up at the gloves’ seams, which quickly got bigger. At this point the gloves were barely functional, but to top it all off, one of the seams at the wrist came undone entirely. These gloves went straight to the trash where they belong."
1.0,Mine is missing the switch for inside the glove...how do I get that switch? Glove is nice but probably better if I had a switch to make the lights go on
1.0,"Huge, uncomfortable, cheaply made especially for high price. Awful cheap plastic smell"
1.0,"I thought the $30 was a bit steep, but they described the fabric as 95% high quality cotton.  It appeared to be a gorgeous burgundy color.  I figured I’d splurge and the good quality would be worth the cost.  First off, it has zero cotton.  It is 95% rayon, 5% spandex.  The color is NOT burgundy.  It’s closer to a dark orange, really ugly.  It reminds me of very rotten pumpkins.  It gets worse.  They specifically describe the fabric as flowy and not clingy.  This is VERY thin and clingy.  It’s not something you could lounge around in.  Finally, when I tried it on to determine if I wanted to try this in another color since several reviewers said it was comfortable.....wrong.  There’s smocking in the back which puts a huge thick seam where the gathered fabric is attached and it runs across your shoulder blades.  Terrible.  Not comfortable, ugly, and cheap fabric that is so clingy it’s practically see-through.  I’m sending this back.  I gave it one star because I did like the asymmetrical hemline."
1.0,Cheap costume jewelry. Don't waste your money!!!!!
1.0,It's  medium but it's a child's medium...not helpful for an adult....
1.0,The longer cord came out of the silver end piece the day I bought it.
1.0,This one has no brand on it and it's super short
1.0,"This said pink, when in fact it was peach and orange. Nothing pink about it."
1.0,I was so looking firward to this earring but I nevet got it and I havent had time to deter mind if was charged if I was ill ask for a refun d very  very disappointed and I never heard from the company you need to take them off your vender list and I wish I didn't have to hilite a star they don't deserve it
1.0,I bought 2 of these. They both broke during the second use. One it's zipper popped off. The other's strap ripped during use.
1.0,Too big size down.
1.0,Total junk. I just wanted some cheap hoops but this was the cheapest ugliest you could ever get.  Right in trash. Not worth returning
1.0,"There are 3 zippers on each luggage.  Within 2 trips, I had 4 broken zippers.  One wheel fell off, and the thin plastic had a hole about 3 inches wide in it.  This is not the type of luggage that survives air travel.  If I could give it no stars, I would."
1.0,"Love the look, but got the dress and if feels cheap."
1.0,The watch crystal was broken. We ordered another one because my granddaughter loved it and was heartbroken. I sure hope the new one is not broken. A crystal on a kids watch should be tempered and should not break.
1.0,They are not original ones!
1.0,Bow fell off within about an hour and then the second one fell off shortly after. Not well made
1.0,Cheap material. Fits like a shirt
1.0,Waited three months for delivery and broke out in hives after wearing for one day.
1.0,Product is waaay too small. The picture makes the item look much larger than actual size. Very disappointed and will never buy again.
1.0,Got a size larger and it was too tight.
1.0,Horrible fabric very wrinkly and wrinkles don't come out of it. Worst fabric I have ever bought. I immediately returned it.
1.0,Disappointed very bendy and turns colors
1.0,The set broke after only a few weeks of light use.I have an office job and they could'nt survive that
1.0,I used the size chart and order the shoe up a size from what it recommended. The shoe came in and fit snug on my sons feet. They also slide off very easy. I tried adding socks and it made the sliding worse.
1.0,"So disappointing. The edges are just rough cut, not hemmed. Maybe mine was a mistake but I think not. I could tell the edges were already beginning to roll, as fabric will do. I guess that’s why so cheap!"
1.0,"The bag fell at an awkward angle when I tried it on as a cross body. Did not have enough length in the strap for me to work with it. The color was pretty, just not a comfortable fit."
1.0,"I ordered a 4X it was too small for my daughter who wears a L, can’t get response for return of this item & refund. Apparently refunds DON’T exist don’t waste your money,"
1.0,Not even close to a XXL. Maybe XXShort and XXWide. If you are 4'2&#34; tall and wide this nightgown is for you. My wife is 5'9&#34; tall so this was like a very loose midriff.
1.0,"I got a 2xl to be on the safe side and it is extremely small.  If I raise my arms it rides up above my belly and barely covers my belly with them down.. Frankly I'm not all that overweight so I'm not the issue.<br /><br />I also made the mistake of putting it on without washing it first and now I have a burning sensation on my lower back, even after taking a long shower just now.  I don't recall ever having this problem with a piece of clothing before.<br /><br />It does look like the picture, so I'm tempted to give it a point just for that, but no one should buy this shirt."
1.0,very awkward design
1.0,"This product arrived with rips and holes in the seams. It is not a dress at all, it is a robe and it does not fit as described. Incredibly disappointed."
1.0,ok so I know these are disposable. I only expected to used them once to get through the rain seeing a concert.  I barely got it out of the bag and mine ripped and it was not only me my husband's ripped. As we were wearing them walking it seemed they kept ripping. The drawstring on mine fell out. My husband's stayed but the hood ripped from the base. We had to laugh as rain poured on us that I guess maybe these ponchos are made for dry weather or they are disposable as you wear them in the rain.
1.0,"The necklace broke the minute I took it out of the package, I didn't even get to wear it once. Lame."
1.0,I dont like the shape when you put it on the side sticks out
1.0,"Well,  let’s just say it looks super sexy on the model. However if your bigger then an “A” cup this is not the outfit for you. A little disappointing since I really liked the rest of it"
1.0,My husband has worn this size for years. This shirt measured 2 sizes too small.
1.0,Literally chokes me.
1.0,"I was excited to get this beautiful sweater but immediately on opening the box, I could see it was way too small. I sent it back."
1.0,Couldnt return it yet.
1.0,"Terrible band. Doesn't snap closed, very loose connection, kept falling off and dropping to the ground. Band holds tracker securely, although it doesn't have that &#34;snap&#34; noise. Had to switch back to my OEM."
1.0,I ordered a 36 and they are extremely small!  I like the concept of these bras so I will be returning the 36 and ordering a bigger size.
1.0,low Quality!!
1.0,I received the box and it was empty<br />I hope this was just a mistake<br />I would like a replacement
1.0,"This suit looks great in pictures but not in real life. No form and the breast padding area is weird, thin material. I will be returning ASAP."
1.0,uncomfortable and terrible fit
1.0,Junk. My wife bought it and within 2 weeks it was a dingy gray
1.0,Too large.Look gaudy. Feel very cheaply made.
1.0,Not worth waiting for.  Very small--dime size.  Don't buy.
1.0,"received the bras today and i tried the hot pink one on first . before i get to that, as i was taking them out of the package, i noticed there's a mint, hot pink, and then the one that's supposed to be "" nude "" is actually just a blush pink . the lace part at the top IS NOT covered by fabric, unlike it is shown in the picture, and if yoy pay attention to the tag on the bras, it says the company name, along with "" lingerie "" . dont know if thats a big deal for anyone, but these wouldn't be the type of bras to wear if you're out at work or hanging with friends . other than the lace part, im satisfied so far ."
1.0,Waste of money completely. Cheaply made falling apart from the package
1.0,"After wearing these socks for several weeks, I realized that the anti-slip material is all under the arch of the foot, and not under the ball and the heel of the foot.  Useless for anti-slip unless you are flatfooted!  I consider these socks dangerous, as they give a false sense of security to the wearer."
1.0,After 2 warnings shirt started to notice threads starting to come out. Product is poor  quality
1.0,Says it was delivered and picture was take but just not on my porch someone elses.
1.0,Will be sending back. Only tried on the latch will not close.
1.0,"See through, cheap material, sleeves were even short and I'm short, I threw it in the trash"
1.0,"The buttons were poorly and sloppily super glued on… the stitching was pulled and loose on the brim, and the Material is basically plastic. The stitching was so loose on the brim it wasn’t even fitted and was bunching. Don’t buy this product."
1.0,"cheap material, gross and cheap"
1.0,The colour not match the pic.<br />The outlook not match the pic( esp. the eye)<br />Made in china but pad quality.
1.0,Delivered safely but mold inside all over unfortunately.
1.0,Cannot withstand water droplets or any type of water.. it comes through the sides which sticks together and does not snap together into place like a hard plastic . It is made of a flexible material where water seeps through also it opens up very easy. Nearly damaged my phone believing in the whole water proof concept. This case is trash. Buy hard cover waterproof case don't even waste your money. This is so thin also it is just ridiculous/ it is like a piece of bologna! No stars no stars!
1.0,A triple X and it is still small.  I am 6 foot 4 inch and around 225.  Disappointing.
1.0,I didn’t like this top at all. The material was kind of silky the ruffle design on the sleeve was not as apparent as it is on the model. The neck was wide and weird. I returned it.
1.0,They don’t cut glare down one bit. That’s why I bought them for night driving.
1.0,Just didn't fit right. The waist was to high.
1.0,"I ordered size 6mm....... got the box of gauges, box states that they are size 2g ear plugs, way to big, will not fit!<br />Can not return because the package was destroyed. Not a very happy customer."
1.0,"You get what you pay for, I should have known better. It is small and the chain is short and flimsy."
1.0,The dress is really pretty but the material is very thick and stiff.  I wore it to a theme party and don't think I would be able to wear it again because of the material.
1.0,For being 28 bucks is ridiculously priced to the fact that there kid sizes not close to be women's
1.0,I wear a US SIZE 16 or 1XL. I am 42c in bust size. The blouse was way too small. It fit like a Medium. The pants were a perfect fit. Very stretchy and comfortable. Love the soft material just not the right size in the Blouse / Boob section
1.0,"Basically, ordered these to replace my brushed stainless steel hoops.  Turns out these were painted, though not described so in product description. The paint came off, oh about 10 days in or so.  I could see the steel through some spots.  I scraped a piece with a finger nail and a giant paint chip came off... Garbage."
1.0,so cheap looking!!
1.0,I can't believe how small these are.  They are small on my 13 year old daughter. How tiny would the kids size be? Beware of size.
1.0,This is a fleece jacket it’s not a faux fur it’s fleece looks nothing like the picture it’s very cheap it’s not worth keeping but there’s a charge to return it. I’d say this is from China and it’s junk
1.0,"Not too thrilled with these. Just a piece of thin foam, doesn’t provide much protection when the ear loops rip easily."
1.0,"fits really big and looks very pajama like, ok for around the house but  wouldn't wear it outside.  RETURNED IT"
1.0,"I used this for the first time today.  It broke within 15 minutes of use.  Won't stay open, won't stay closed.  The worst."
1.0,"I received it yesterday and returned it today when I found out that it was already bent. I wanted to try to replace it, but didn't see that option, so I decided to send it back."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:cc2a5d27297860c69b5d3495df3b2507]] Not what expected and to return I have to pay 3+ dollars in shipping back and print the label.
1.0,Do not purchase. Not worth it- I’m returning this item. Pictures are not accurate- it’s massive plus you cannot read the message when on the face. Plus MADE IN CHINA!!!!!
1.0,Bought sixes 2x and 3x because I had never tried this brand and figured I would return the ones that didn’t fit What said xl was really 2x and what was 2x was really 3x don’t understand the labeling but sent both pkgs back. Will not try again.
1.0,I bought this to carry things down to the beach.  During our very first use the zipper broke BEFORE we could even take it down to the beach.  Then the handle came off where it was connected yo the bag. Unfortunately for us our return from our trip was after the date we could return it’s we bought it in anticipation of the trip.  DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1.0,"Terrible, flat and cheaply made. Had to open it up and put some fluff in it."
1.0,To long for me I’m a 5’ tall so it’s too long and bulky
1.0,It is so small I had to return it. I think you have to go up 2 sizes
1.0,"I love the pendant but after wearing it three times only, it came off the gold piece that held it from the necklace.<br />I can see the cheap glue residue.<br />Looks amazing but is bad quality."
1.0,"Ugly, poorly made, terrible feeling fabric"
1.0,I ordered what was supposed to be black tourmaline. I got a brown bracelet that's made of ceramic or porcelain or something. cheap garbage.
1.0,"These earrings are nice looking if only they were made without chemicals. Please note, this product is NOT organic/Natural wood. There was black dye that came off earnings and caused severe allergic reaction causing swelling/pain/redness/irritation/itching to my ear lobes. I requested a refund from Amazon."
1.0,I was disappointed with these slippers to big fall off feet and already worn on inside
1.0,Worst ever !!<br />Different from the picture.<br />Returned!
1.0,"Returned, too large for my daughter"
1.0,The shirt I ordered looks burnt orange in the photo but was bright red.
1.0,I was expecting a higher quality product
1.0,I ordered a 2xl and this came sooo small.. it wouldn’t fit my sister who wears a size medium
1.0,"the sizing on this was way off, but my granddaughter thought it was great."
1.0,The bodice would have fit her... but the neck area was as big around as my wrist! I have TINY wrists. I didn’t even try to put it on her. It was impossible! You’d think anyone even glancing at it would realize sormthing was wrong.
1.0,Doesn’t look like pic and fits way smaller then actual size!
1.0,"I ordered this shirt three times in a medium and received a large every time. They obviously do not look at the size that you ordered they just send a shirt. I do like the shirt, the stretch, and how soft it is, but I usually wear a small/medium and just could not make a large work."
1.0,Two small  I got the largest you had
1.0,"Cheap, rubs the gold off within a couple of days!"
1.0,Cheap fabric...
1.0,This price is ridiculous and it's &#34;rose gold-tone&#34;
1.0,Received an obvious returned item! No shrink wrap on it. Tape on the bottom and top. Plus the box is all banged up.
1.0,"After I played it for a while, the top of the black diamond just got off. And I lost it forever. This really isn't good."
1.0,Poor material the style were totally different ugly looking dress when you see it with the natural eyes nothing like what they Advertise in the store.
1.0,No me agrado porque el pulso del reloj se daño con facilidad
1.0,"First, this is probably the most uncomfortable belt I've ever worn.  If you don't have a shirt tucked in, and you are sitting, the buckle digs right into your stomach.  So after one day of wearing this uncomfortable thing, it completely fell apart when I was loosening it to remove my pants."
1.0,The fit was weird. This was honestly a huge headache based on my daughter being plus size & the measurements given. If you have the time do custom size & you may have a better outcome. Sending it back is not free & was so expensive for us since it was at my expense & their located in China. Then when they received it back they didn’t want to give me full credit so Amazon had to get involved to resolve the issue which thankfully they did.
1.0,Much more glitzy than I thought... gawdy!
1.0,I ordered the 2t to 4t size and when I received it it was like the size of a newborn so it didn’t fit my sons head so wasn’t happy about this try to have it replaced or return and i could not get them to do that. So not happy with that at all so I have to keep it even though it didn’t fit my son. Now I’m a little scared to try and order another one
1.0,do not stay together to hold on ears.
1.0,Had bought one before and liked it but it was starting to get scratched and faded. I ordered a new one and it had more beads and was too big. Also after a week the rubber string broke.. looking for a new bracelet now.
1.0,Lace tore 1st time I put it one for both colors
1.0,I followed the sizing guide and this item was still WAY too small. I think it might fit a child perhaps. I usually wear a US medium and I ordered an XL. I could not send it back because when I tried it on the snap busted and flew across the room. The item is also a poor quality. It is a very thin cheap fabric.
1.0,very cheaply made and it looks cheap
1.0,not much capacity to put stuff in 😣
1.0,This product frequently loses its connectivity to wifi and rebooting it requires a physical intervention. This is annoying and self defeating.
1.0,"So cute, but so disappointed! They arrived dirty & broken in a sealed bag - weird! I'm not sure whether I'll send them back or clean them up & try to super glue the little gold piece back on. I had read other reviews with the same complaint, but took a chance anyway... Hate to say it, ""You guys were right!"" 😫"
1.0,"Logo not centered, not true trucker cap, printed logo, stitching off, printed with TM standard. Reported for violation. Does not deserve even one star."
1.0,Two washes made xl into a small
1.0,These gloves are way too small.  I can not understand why the seller would bother selling and then have gloves returned at their cost.  Other sellers post dimensions for your information.  This seller does not.
1.0,The watch band is super cute and looks great. But the band has fallen off five times in two days. Twice while I was sleeping which was odd and once at the grocery store. The grocery store incident was scary since I could have lost my brand new watch. It’s not worth the risk of losing the watch.
1.0,They were so cute on but before I got to the event they fell apart.  Very disappointed
1.0,Nothing like in pictures! I passed it on as a gift.
1.0,My grandson really liked it and it worked well for him but the plastic band broke after about a month.
1.0,way to big and ugly sent back
1.0,"Return window closed, one of the belt was sewn inside the outfit than outside, couldn’t even wear it. bummed."
1.0,"Did not like the fabric and wasn't even right fitting for the size I ordered, I order a 2x, looks like a med/large size!"
1.0,"If i had an option for no stars thats what it would be. I bought this as a gift, left it in the package and wrapped it. The necklace was already broke in the package and we didnt know until it was opened. On the package it says once package is opened theres no returns or refunds even if the product arrives damaged. Which tells me this happens a lot. Savr your money and find something else."
1.0,"Not the true color in the description. Khaki is gold, gray is baby blue or country gray, navy is more royal blue."
1.0,Not happy. The shoes arrived in a damaged box and there is a terrible white scratch/scuff<br />These were meant to be a gift. I bought some earlier for myself and love them<br />Kindly<br />Jacqueline
1.0,"The quality and durability can be considered less than one star. Many of them didn't last more than two days. The knot is not a true slip knot. It's merely a piece of sting wrapped around and genericly glued. The ones that didn't fall apart frayed within days too.  The color was more on the orange side. I gave some of them away, otherwise I would have returned them. Just buy the rope and do a you tube tutorial and get your moneys worth."
1.0,"We have had these sunglasses before but this pair broke the very first time my husband wore them. He was at a tennis match, took them off to wipe his face and the bow broke off. Had no back up pair."
1.0,"It did warm up, but they stopped working so fast that I didn't even get the chance to experience them other than putting them on a couple of times and realized that it was like walking on wires and the battery pack weight and size was not fun to deal with. These are now in a landfill somewhere."
1.0,"This watch is a second, a cheap piece of junk. The dial cover is plastic and falls out if you give the watch a little shake or tap when it is open. totally worthless."
1.0,The only problem is that they were advertised as long leggings (down to the ankle) but they fit around the calf. I only needed long leggings so I returned. I am not sure if they have updated description and picture.
1.0,"My husband uses these strictly for driving - he got them for Christmas and the seams are coming apart.  Badly made - I would definitely not recommend them.  Tried to return for an exchange, but I am two days too late."
1.0,It will shrink horribly. Just a first wash on cold with a gentle dry causes it to shrink at least two sizes!
1.0,Not worth it - these are such poor quality
1.0,There was something wrong with this dress. It wasn't made right. Extra material around the waist. Very odd. Returned.
1.0,This is was I expected to receive got 4 metal bottom underneath the bag. But what received is totally no metal bottom. Two different picture one is the seller and the other I took a picture went I received wrong. I'm very disappointed
1.0,"No aguantan la pela de poner, quitar, ajustar. La goma se rompe y no se puede reemplazar por otra. Mal diseño."
1.0,Just received my mask and put new batteries in it and nothing no lights! Not happy at all considering I am supposed to be wearing it for Halloween which is in 2 days!
1.0,The top portion was discolored as if black was faded. It also fit my double D boobs weird.
1.0,"I could not take a pic with this on because it's sooo tight. It seems like a great binder of sorts but I didn't just gain weight in my stomach, my thighs as well. So I can't get the garment over them with my scar ."
1.0,"No where in the description does this say it has lift padding in the cup.  I'm not interested in lift, I just want coverage."
1.0,Cheap fabric and coloring
1.0,Straps broke in less than a week
1.0,Nada que ver ala imagen tela super transparente y muy mal.fabricado
1.0,I don't understand whats going on here..<br /> Everytime I order something it has some kind of unnatural smell/smells that shouldn't be on new clothes.<br /> This swimsuit stinks so bad that it's burning my nose & throat!<br />I'm not happy at all!!
1.0,I bought an xxl and am a size 14... there was NO way I was fitting in these jeans 😑 the legs fit amazing and I was so excited but and waist was a no go 🙁 not even close. My guess is that they might fit like a 10.
1.0,I only received one ear ring..
1.0,Not 100% cotton half polyester
1.0,completely wrong size
1.0,Terrible quality. Sheds. Will not use.
1.0,These pants are very see-through and you can tell the material is cheap. I’m normally a size small on bottom and they were a little tight getting them on. They were returned.
1.0,It's more like an extra small than a large. I'm usually a medium to large. This bathing suit was super small.  I have returned the item.
1.0,They are huge and customer service to return is a pain. They should just use the ups store like everyone else.
1.0,1 broken when received and the other 2 broke first time i wore
1.0,Unfortunately with minimal use these broke within the first two weeks we had them. Disappointed.
1.0,"The fabric is so inferior, it did not meet my expectations. Totally different to the picture."
1.0,"Design was only on a very, very small portion and most of the band is black.  Retuned."
1.0,They run really small went by the chart and it was still too small need to return them
1.0,"The nIke was large like a man shoe, I did not like it."
1.0,My daughter was super disappointed when she saw the real dress as it doesn’t look AT ALL at the one in the picture shown!<br />The top part of the dress is completely different!
1.0,"The one I received wasn't blue at all, it was totally clear :( very disappointed."
1.0,I bought this in a size for my 18 year old.  Ended up being way too small.  I gave it to my 9 year old.  Super thin material!
1.0,"Very disappointed in this dress. The chest area could not accommodate my 38C size because I do not have octagon shaped pointy breasts. No support whatsoever. I ordered up a size as formal dresses tend to run small and a size 16 was still too tight. Maybe I didn’t give it enough of a chance, but I didn’t want the corset lacing in the back to seem like it was super wide. And I would have definitely needed to get this altered for height, which was to be expected. Returning."
1.0,"I have had my rob less than a week. I loved it at first. Fits nicely, soft, beautiful. Then it splits on the side where the seam is. Then the inside string breaks. Then original split down the side is a huge gaping hole! I have barely worn it. I'm not fighting a bear or rolling around in it...  not worth the money"
1.0,I purchased these in June 30th and they are already falling apart. They are cute but not durable for a 6 year old boy!!
1.0,This is not a head wrap it don’t even fit around my hair FALSE ADVERTISING FO NOT BUY FTOM THEM!!! I’m just opening mines up to use it in very pissed off!!!
1.0,Don’t waste your time!
1.0,"The jewelry itself is pretty, but not hypoallergenic. My tragus was on fire in only a couple of hours 😔."
1.0,"Disappointed,  ring has already missing diamonds that fell out. I did not get a warranty due to the low price.  Now my daughters present from her husband is broke."
1.0,Very see through and the seams are frayed.  UNHAPPY with purchase.
1.0,"The glasses are cute and it has a nice frame but the lenses are terrible! There was a sticky like film over my lenses that I can't seem to get off with anything! I tried lense cleaner, alcohol, windex, nothing has worked! Not worth the money!"
1.0,sent me the wrong size length was way too big. Buckle seems kinda flimsy. Not impressed.
1.0,"Not US sizes, way smaller than size chart."
1.0,Didn’t get item
1.0,The actual temple holder is not a silicone so therefore it did not fit my child’s frame they slipped right out super disappointing
1.0,"This jumpsuit appears really cute. And based off the reviews it got, I thought I’d give it a try. Do not make the same mistake as me!! This is a terrible product. Very cheap quality, see through material, very thin, came with a ripped seem. If you are tall, this won’t work for you. I’m 5’6 - 200 pounds, I ordered the XL. The crotch seem is very tight, riding up my cracks! I will be returning ASAP. This might work if you’re super skinny and short, but definitely doesn’t work for all body types."
1.0,Pretty earrings but very large. They would look pretty on my Christmas tree. I sent them back.
1.0,"Looked beautiful for one afternoon, but when I woke up the next day most of the black had worn off of the nose ring.<br /><br />Not only that, but it just so happened that my previous nose ring had nicked the inside of my piercing a day before putting this one in. This nose ring irritated my piercing to the point that it made me nervous. If I had had my usual surgical steel nose ring in, it would have healed overnight, but all the black crap that was rubbing off the metal settled into my piercing and it became more painful, itchy, and swollen by the day, for the couple days I tried wearing it.<br /><br />Think of these black hoops like a cute wig, or a cheap pair of press on nails. Apply just before a night out on the town. It will look cool, but don't expect it to last longer than an overnight."
1.0,"The fabric is absolutely terrible, very cheap feeling. The cut is also super boxy so you either have to rock it in or tie it up."
1.0,"Like another reviewer I also received a &#34;One Piece&#34; NOT Deathnote ring. I didn't notice because I bought it for someone else. It says Deathnote on the packaging, but it ISN'T!"
1.0,"I ordered a medium, only because a lot of these clothes tend to run small.  I figured what the heck, a little big would be better than it not fitting.  Once again, my 8 year old granddaughter became the proud owner.  Not me."
1.0,Item arrived broken. They are offering a 30 percent refund on a broken item. Not acceptable!
1.0,Was happy with the fit of these shorts. Was very unhappy with them as far as quality...had the shorts for around 2 months before the material tore into a big tear right behind the left back pocket.
1.0,I received this necklace and it was barely long enough for a 3 yr old child.  I could not even get it around my neck.  I will use the beads for something else.  disappointed
1.0,"The dress is cute. The fit is definitely not cute.<br />If you have a very flat chest this dress is perfect for you! Anything more than a B cup and you may want to move along. I ordered my size according to the measurements provided in the listing, not just the size, and there's no way it's accurate. Even if I lost 20 pounds I still couldn't fit into this. The waist band sits right over the middle of my boobs because the top part is so tiny. The stitching looks like it was done in the dark and the white on the chevron is more of a cream which looks strange next to the stark white in the white band. It's cute in the picture but kind of a disaster in person."
1.0,I ordered large size and it looks like small.
1.0,Frames were bent.
1.0,"This neclace came wrapped in a cute envelope. It was a gift, and when she opened it...it was broken. I know it was cheap, but I didnt expect to pay for a broken neclace and then have the hassle of doing a return. Even if it wasnt broken upon delivery, made so poorly it probably would have broken within a day of wearing."
1.0,See through and not worth the money spent!
1.0,"After only 3 months, the arm fell off when I picked them up off the table to out them on.  Would return if the window hadnt passed.  Won't buy this brand again, cheaply made"
1.0,"I received this thinking it would be a great accessory. Unfortunately I wore it twice & went to wear it again, but it had already turned an ugly color. It is now unwearable. Don't expect to wear this more than once or twice!"
1.0,"I bought the shoes for my 3 1/2-year-old daughter. The first time she wore them, they ripped. I will be sending them back."
1.0,Returning.  Did not performed as stated.
1.0,looks are decieving
1.0,I don't like this. It looks too much like a medical jacket. Couldn't return it.
1.0,No me gusto nada del vestido no se ve igual
1.0,This was the worst swimsuit I’ve ever purchased. I would not recommend!
1.0,Very cheaply made. The rhinestones started falling off as soon as I opened it.
1.0,It did not fit at all for the size chart. I usually wear a size medium and the size chart suggested I buy an xxl so I did and it was sooo tight and uncomfortable fitting.
1.0,The description should say they are not real sterling silver because all my charms tarnished. Ive only had them 2 weeks and they are no good.
1.0,Was nothing like the picture.. Awful
1.0,The metal bendable adjustable nose piece is on the bottom do you would have to wear picture upside down. Don’t Buy
1.0,"These were so tight, like compression socks. Did not work for me."
1.0,Doesn't look like the picture at all. Loose & not in a good way
1.0,This watchband is such poor quality compared to other REAL leather bands I have purchased elsewhere online. And if that's not bad enough it SMELLS musty!
1.0,This clearly says 6 pieces of different styles of belly rings so why did I only receive 2? Where are the other 4? Requesting a refund. It’s not that these were overly expensive but I expect to get what I paid for.
1.0,Size chart not to size got it in correct size and not true to size Child that I gave it to Thruway the paperwork so I cannot return it<br />That Really sucks because he didn’t get a gift now
1.0,"The plastic latch broke within 3 weeks. Not very study for little ones, but possibly okay for older kids."
1.0,It's just a nylon jacket. Granddaughter wanted it so I kept it .
1.0,I purchased this as a Christmas gift. I’m embarrassed to give it to them! The “logic” is not centered at all and the shirt is paper thin.
1.0,The design is upside down:(
1.0,"No space between mask and lips , lips are on the mask"
1.0,These are a wonderful color and size but they turned black inside my nose and smelled strange after one week. Yuck. Probably made of a cheap not safe material...
1.0,Totally not even close to real sizes in the US. I ordered XL and it doesn't even cover my chest. Looks like an XL in girls maybe.
1.0,"What an absolutely beautiful, watch and how devastating to see my granddaughter’s face after spending Christmas day trying to get this watch to work! Tried to use the troubleshooting the first question asked is if this is an android or Apple watch. Couldn’t tell ya, it’s nowhere on the package or in the description on Amazon! Waiting for tech help to call, but that doesn’t seem to be happening either! Buy this watch, if you want to lose your mind and your patience!"
1.0,Super cute but doesn't last.
1.0,This one changed colors although it was supposed to be real 925 very disappointed
1.0,"The box came dirty (used) and the Case was slightly uneven and not aligned ... would have been a great purchase for $20 but my actual shades were worth $500 how can I put them into this ?? Lost my original one at the airport and now this, unbelievable. I can never catch a break."
1.0,The fit was WAYYY too small and Tha material was not the greatest.
1.0,Very disappointed.. Still getting glare :(  Apparently I did not purchase these glasses for appearance! I need something for the glare when I am driving. These glasses were not the answer.
1.0,"The watch has excellent movement. But the band is poorly constructed, flimsy and ready to break at the slightest stress. Very junky quality. If it wasn’t so pretty, under $5 would be a fair price. $25 for this fragile toy of a watch is about $20 too much. Right away I noticed the pins coming out of the band attached to the watch itself.<br />I discovered the it’s fragility when I attempted to remove links for proper sizing. Unless you have jeweler quality tools, do not attempt to adjust  anything on this watch. It’s definitely not meant for the slightest disassembly. Garbage."
1.0,I did not like it. It was small and the arm sleeve was too tight. I was uncomfortable wearing it.
1.0,Junk does not fit to size
1.0,"The fabric was not breathable,  more of a satin finish with a cotton backing. Not sure the ""vents"" were actually venting. Wouldn't buy this again. I'm sorry. Not trying to be negative to the seller, just not a fit for me."
1.0,Seam feel apart in the washer
1.0,Ordered my right size. Had to send back to small.
1.0,Cheap made and one of the hinges has already broken.  Not good quality
1.0,I ordered a XL and is looks like a M is not true to size.
1.0,CHEAP! Fell apart first day of wearing it!!!  REALLY???!!!!!! How about making something that lasts at least a week!???
1.0,Does not work !!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,I really wanted to love the shirts because they look fun and vibrant. I got the blue one as well. But I can’t use them since the sleeves are ginormous. The blue one literally makes me look like a sushi chef. I couldn’t return it since I got them during the early pandemic. I wouldn’t recommend this if you are looking for slim fit.
1.0,Terrible!!!!<br />Didnt inflate right!!!<br />Didnt work right!!!<br />Too difficult to return for refund !!!
1.0,This bracelet is very light and thin and you can hardly see the diamond.
1.0,This was all kinds of awful. It not only didn't fit right but was misshapen with one side sticking out in the middle. Gah! It didn't look anything like the picture and was way too roomy in the chest. Stitching was shoddy. It was a hot mess of a dress. I do not recommend it.
1.0,"I don't recommend buying this necklace. I bought the grey, but the beads look blue and the tassle almost green. It isn't not worth the money."
1.0,The shoes aren't made right..  the band isn't on the shoe properly
1.0,"Oversized is an understatement. Ordered a small, it is huge. The tags are sewn on the outside of the sweater? Very disappointed, it's basically junk."
1.0,Had to send back. They were way too large. Did not have good support.
1.0,"very thin, nice and scary which is what I wanted but very thin"
1.0,"I'm small, but this dress is enormous on me and gaping.  It's not even that it's too large, but the straps where your shoulders some out are completely uneven.  One side is much larger than the other.  Low quality item made in China."
1.0,Runs big. It looks nothing like the picture. Very dark and poor quality material.
1.0,No encajó con la gafa
1.0,I’m 5’3 112 lbs and got a small. Real long and the arm pit area was huge. Color was off also it was very dull but design was as pictured. I returned it.
1.0,"Laces shredded in a week, toes scuffed and wore off after a few days. Poor quality."
1.0,Horrible hooks- I can’t close my closet door!!  They don’t lay flat at the top.  I purchased another brand that worked great...these are going in the trash.
1.0,Nothing like the picture or description. Dont order
1.0,The tool worked great but the joy sticks must be refurbished from old joy sticks they are already breaking. Nothing but garbage.
1.0,Knob to use to attach to Fitbit broke off before it could be installed.  Returned item.<br />It's a shame because the watch band itself is really nice. They just need to use a sturdier metal assist knob so it can easily be installed and removed.
1.0,Very nice. Thick and durable...a little to big but it works<br /><br />As of aug 9th 2020.. zipper broke and could no longer use wallet...3 months
1.0,This product was really horrible and looks extremely cheap. The fabric is a weird velvet on the inside and some keep smooth fabric on the inside. The stitching was a joke and the buttons were flimsy. Do not buy.
1.0,Bought this item in May.  It broke in July.  Two whole months of use.  Just sayin’
1.0,"This necklace did not look as good to me as it did in the picture, and it was way too short for my sister. I sent it back. I think this necklace would be a better by for a tween, or younger person, but not an adult."
1.0,"These didn't work out well. Broke upon opening them...every single one! (With my big, strong girl hands🤣) The clip type ones seem to be okay"
1.0,Super flat could not get anything I needed in it.  Could use to go out because all you need is phone CC and ID.
1.0,"They jus turn everything yellow, I did not notice any change in glare. I’m very disappointed!"
1.0,Super loose and not flattering at all also really long
1.0,"I was very excited to get my Keychain in today for my brand new tundra... only one problem, I never got what I paid for... all I received was an oversized box for the tiny Keychain box with no product in the box. Yay, 12 bucks for 2 boxes..."
1.0,"This is not worth the price, my daughter got it for herself to spend birthday money and she cried cause it wasn't what she expected, flimsy materials used, cant really use it because its thin, and straps are so thin they look like they will snap. I felt bad I will be getting her one thats better made... disappointing! That belongs in a dollar store bin."
1.0,the size is very small is like for a child of 5 or 6 years old despite being xl
1.0,Feels so cheap.
1.0,I bought this for a teenager. It said they were thinx teens but they fit like adult sizes. The 14 could fit me and I’m 150 lbs with a large behind.
1.0,Not sure these are real ! Very small .too EXPENSIVE!
1.0,"Fit like a bra, not long enough."
1.0,"Terrible. Ordered for my boyfriend for Xmas, it came but the hands didn’t work. We took it to a jewelry store and bought a new battery. That still didn’t fix it. Now sent back and still waiting for a refund a month later!! If I could give it 0 stars I would!!"
1.0,"Disappointing. They are advertised as &#34;durable&#34;, but that is not the case. My son plays tennis 3 times a week at minimum. They became loose and flexible very fast. Had to replace too quickly for what I paid."
1.0,They were not comfortable and too large
1.0,Lasted less than a week of gentle use.
1.0,Runs way small and seams pop every time she moves. Material is a little stiff and irritating
1.0,"It's a great necklace, I wore mine for several months before it started to break down. I 1 star it because its not 17 bucks, I got it for 6. It's amazing and cool, but not worth 17 dollars."
1.0,The picture you displayed is misleading and you didn't provide paid return postage.
1.0,"Felt cheap, looked cheap...Adjustment tool didn’t work either. Returned."
1.0,"The outside layer of the suit with the print<br />stretched out in less than 3 months, making it unwearable."
1.0,Not an Opal. Stone is listed as an Opal but its synthetic. Looks like there is glitter in there.
1.0,Way too many rocks in this jewelry make these too heavy to hang off your ears.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and is super cheesy and the tip of the cover will not bend like a witch shoe
1.0,Doesn’t fit as expected. Not flattering. Tiny pad cups in top that don’t remotely fit Ewr breasts. Awful awful AWFUL smell. Like a nasty factory and cigarette smoke. Just terrible.
1.0,Does not stretch! It is just a long piece of cloth.
1.0,Don’t waste your money to buy this. It itches like crazy. And looks nothing like the picture
1.0,Nowhere near as pretty as they look in the picture.
1.0,Received this and decided to inspect it before I wrapped it since it was a gift.  It’s already defective and has some of the material coming up.
1.0,too tight  cant wear
1.0,"I was happy at first, they look pretty, but after wearing them for a few days my ears had a black spot as big as the earrings, and the back of the earrings and the lock thing were green. 😞"
1.0,"I ordered according to size for my wife. What I got was L. Large. So I am guessing these come in small, medium and large. Large = size 13 in men’s, American. Which is huge, even by American standards. Also, the insole does NOT look like the picture.  It is black with hob knob textures that look painful. I am not even going to finish unwrapping it. Even as a gag gift - this is a fail."
1.0,"Unfortunately, this product is faulty and didn’t even last 1 hour. The piece that goes into the band hole came off right away. So I would strongly recommend a do not purchase."
1.0,Turned brown quickly
1.0,Very cheap construction. I can not recommend. The first one broke in an hour. I threw them both away. Buy at your own risk.
1.0,"Keep your money this junk is a waste of tax payers money. Listen to me in keep your coins. Lot of this stuff here on amazon is sold as junk, garbage , or out of desperation smh. Shame how vendors get over ."
1.0,"I know its a knock off and I wasn't expecting the Taj Mahal of sunglasses. These are far more flimsy than the ones I usually get at Kohls, and they fell off of  my face.  They didn't fit my nose at all, and I am pretty average. The case is pretty nice though. Shipping was average, packaging was ok.  No problems.  Took a gamble.  since there weren't any reviews yet.. and regretting doing so."
1.0,"The hat arrived with lots of wrinkles, but it's ok . And it's too small and tight for me, sadly no sizes can chose. Material is thin and cheap."
1.0,"This is not waterproof, FYI. It was raining yesterday when I received it, so I tried it on immediately. I got soaked."
1.0,Fits too bigly
1.0,I received the item and its dented from one of the sides
1.0,Very tight .... I'm unable to use it...
1.0,"My wife loves the color purple / violet. When I saw this necklace, I was certain this would place a huge smile on my wife's face.  However, these stones lacked any real color and brilliance.  The silver behind the stones washed away what color there was. Honestly, I sincerely believe my wife was &#34;being nice&#34; knowing that her wrapped gift sat on our kitchen table for an entire week until the day of our wedding anniversary arrived - My anticipation of watching my wife jump with glee, was dashed when she opened the box - I was soooo very deeply disappointed with what I saw.  I won't purchase jewelry from MB Life again.  I'm certain that the necklace we see pictured in this ad is photo shopped.  Certainly, fraudulent and deceptive practices on their part.  Look at our photo!<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE THIS - unless you want to be deeply disappointed.  The stones look like clear glass... hardly any color at all!"
1.0,I didn’t like the material. Not soft at all.
1.0,These are No Better Then a Pair of Tights.<br />What a Rip Off.<br />Warm tho...
1.0,Doesn't look like it does in pic crumpled up in back
1.0,"Good quality fabric,color  and nice cut, but dress size L is TINY.  I regularly wear  size 12 or 14 and ordered size Large per size chart.  Sleeves and bodice are  TINY- might fit my size 6 stepdaughter.  Skirt if ample, but top part far too small.  Returning it."
1.0,Not worth the money.  Stitching came undone as soon as I tied it around the neck.
1.0,"UPDATE: Sorry, I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 1 star.  The bracelet WAS pretty but the first one broke the very first day I received it. The seller was very responsive and sent a replacement right away. The second one lasted a couple of weeks, but it ended up breaking, too. It's not as if I was rough on them. I wore it to work (ordinary office work, nothing physical). The chain just falls apart where it meets the bead on the chain.  If the construction had been sturdier, it would have been my favorite bracelet.<br /><br />Many bracelets are little tighter on me than I prefer. I like to wear a 7-1/2 but many bracelets seem to be 7&#34;. This anklet is 8&#34; long (up to 9&#34; if you use the extender). I wear it as a bracelet and love it. If your wrist are dainty, this would not work as a bracelet for you, but it your wrists are a bit larger and typical bracelets tend to be tight, this will be perfect as a bracelet. As an anklet, it would work for someone with smaller ankles - it just fit my 20 year old daughters ankle but was too small for my ankle -- that's okay since I bought it hoping to use it as a bracelet. Summary: Perfect for larger wrists or smaller ankles."
1.0,Was broken when i recieved them! Had to send back!
1.0,Description shows 2 jumpsuits and we recieved only 1.
1.0,Handles came off when we tried to pick them up. We got them back on and evidently they broke off again when we were on our trip and now they are missing. If they could fix the handles I would rate this 5 stars. Please have someone contact me to replace the handles. This was the first time we used them and now they are useless without the handle.
1.0,"Be aware of this product, don’t waste your money.<br />His product started to fall apart the first my son wore  them"
1.0,These are NOT sterling silver and should NOT be advertised as such!! People have allergies and my poor 4 year old daughter just suffered because of your companies neglect!! You can see the hearts marked into her ears from the earrings. Her ears were bleeding when she came to me telling me she wanted the earrings out. To my horror this is what I found AFTER cleaning them up with peroxide. They looked even worse before cleaning them up!
1.0,Runs small and it's not well made
1.0,These are HORRIBLE!  The pumpkins keep falling off the stem!  Its super irritating!
1.0,"Worn them less than 10 times, for a short period of time, and stitching is coming apart in 4 places plus 1 eyelet came off. Poor product.<br /><br />Update: Review of product the same. I contacted company and they did send me new pair, so 5 stars for customer service."
1.0,"Very weird fit, cheap denim material."
1.0,Cheap quality. Definitely not high waisted. Weird cut and fit. AWFUL customer service!!!
1.0,They look they were made for a pair shaped person not a curvy person so if you have short legs thin thighs and a bigger belly these will fit good but I consider myself to have short legs and the 2 x we're still too short
1.0,"I wear a size Medium/Large pants typically. I am 5’11 and weigh around 190 lbs. I ordered an XL because I know to order up a size or 2 with pants on Amazon. When I say I pulled these up as far as I could (on the thinnest part of my abdomen) and could not zip them, is an understatement! Like 100% could not get them to zip and they have no stretch in the material. I like them, so I’m willing to take them to get some stretchy material added so they can fit, because I love the colors, feel, and length. It’s hard to find this style of pants that will fit my length needs, these are more of a Capri style, but so cute. These are equivalent to a size Small, like I stated I ordered an XL.."
1.0,This dress was so super thin it's thinner than a slip you can see through it. Very poor quality. I I purchase the black dress. I guess I'll wear it for PJs 🤦
1.0,This product would be perfect except that no matter size between small or medium the length of the T is entirely too long.  If I could I would rate it over-all at 0 (zero) because of the excessive length of the construct of the athletic T.
1.0,"Despite measurements from size chart, these gloves were quite small. The overall finger length was short and the length from the base of the finger to the wrist was short as well. This caused the gathering for the wrist, to sit on the palm of my hand. Beautiful gloves, just very small."
1.0,It's not connected.  You tie the string around the babies head and put the cap on.  Ridiculous.  You  could have at least added straps or velcro.<br />.
1.0,"Okay so this is a HONEST review for this heated vest, I’m writing this only to save the next potential purchaser the headache.<br /><br />First impressions:<br /><br />- vest is made of a “paper” like polyester, think about a umbrella, not designed for warmth for sure.<br /><br />- If your like me, I looked a dozens of heated vests and decided to give this one a try because of the 10 heating pads compared to others In a similar price point. Well I can tell you MORE IS NOT BETTER when it comes to heating.<br /><br />- Fitment is okay, I’m 5’9” 180 lbs and the medium “fits” due to the lat zippers with allows for 1” increment adjustments and adjustable shoulder buttons which are 1/2” increment adjustments.<br /><br />WHY I wrote don’t waste your money.<br /><br />1. The heating pads never get “hot” even on high which is 60 c or 120 F. They are just slightly warm, again where I mentioned above more is not better.<br /><br />2. I received the first vest and it was clearly used, 2 of the “heating” pads didn’t even work.<br /><br />3. I ordered a replacement thinking, okay I got a fluke? Well that was mistake number two. The replacement did warm better then the first, however even after giving it 25 min on high it was just luke warm......kinda defeats the purpose of using a “heated” vest wouldn’t you say.?<br /><br />4. Last but not least, you wouldn’t be able to “wear” this vest by itself since it’s so cheaply made and paper like that I would be embarrassed to be seen wearing just by itself as it’s unsightly and would provide ZERO insulation.<br /><br />*** both are being returned as I finish this review ***<br /><br />That’s my HONEST opinion. Take it as you will, my suggestion is to buy one that’s made with polar fleece, that way it’s like a regular vest which can be utilized as a base layer and worn on its own.<br /><br />Good luck."
1.0,I should have listened to the reviews who said the stones were black.  Coal black would be a better description.  No hint of blue that I could detect.  Returned.
1.0,Cheap look and feel. Looks nothing like on the model.
1.0,You are better off to go to the county fair and try to win this shirt by popping balloons with a dart_such a shame Amazon will let this crap be sold its a crime.
1.0,"The ""men's large"" is a smallish-medium, cuts off circulation in my moderately sized hands. Waste of money."
1.0,Shrunk in length 6&quot; after washing and now can't be worn
1.0,Runs small and boxy
1.0,I purchased two packages of these. Two out of the six do not light up.
1.0,These boots isn't what I expected they're to small. i brought a size 10 and the fit like a size 7/8 don't waste your money like I did..
1.0,"This glasses didn't last for a month it started breaking at various parts,I do not recommend this product😡"
1.0,"I ordered dark green, but it’s actually more of a teal color. I would like to return."
1.0,Didn’t love the quality of the fabric.  No label or instructions
1.0,Very cheap material nothing like the picture.
1.0,"I was really excited to get this dress; however, when I opened the package I immediately noticed there was something wrong. The hem of the dress is ripped and frayed all around. It does not look new and it has chalk lines near the hem of the dress as well.<br /><br />I don't even want to try it on after seeing it. Really disappointed in what I got."
1.0,Bought feb 2018 zipper is cheap. comes apart when zipped have to replace the zipper. only worn a few times. I called customer care they were very Obliged for me to return the coat for a refund.
1.0,PANTS WERE EXTREMELY SHORT!!! IM 5'5 WEIGH 140...THESE PANTS LOOK LIKE I HAD ON CAPRIS! AND NOT TO MENTION THE QUALITY OF JEAN MATERIAL HAS TO BE THE CHEAPEST THEY COULD FIND! WILL RIP immediately!
1.0,Had to return these. Made in china....DEFINITELY not true to size.
1.0,The clips doesn't work properly
1.0,I have had it less than a week and the inside leather is coming apart. Large pieces are peeling right out of it.
1.0,Cheap looking & cheaply made
1.0,"I like the shirt, but am unimpressed with 2 things. One being that the bottom snap (the only one I would like to use) doesn't stay snapped. Just breathing makes it come undone. The second being that I contacted the seller a week ago and explained my issue. I have yet to hear from them. I was trying to allow the seller to make me a satisfied customer prior to writing a review, but they obviously don't think much of customer service. I will be returning the shirt and NOT repurchasing like I had intended to do if I had heard back from them."
1.0,Can’t get them in my ears. Way too thick so pretty but going in trash😞
1.0,"Had high hopes for this, based on the description. I’ve never seen a flimsier piece of crap. Don’t even think of ordering. The only good thing, I got a full refund."
1.0,Missing pins. The watch fell part in my wife's hand. It was such an imbaresing gift to give her. I thought it looks cute enough. Had to get pins and a clasp for it to stay together.
1.0,"Great idea but they are cheaply made. The don’t stay up, very little stretch, and the ends aren’t hemmed."
1.0,I ordered the size that normally fits my wife. But way too small.
1.0,Ordered silver frames and got black.  Nose piece was missing.  These are the epitome of cheap sunglasses...  The kind you could find in a $1 bin at the flea market.
1.0,This is NOT a waist training corset! It will not give any results or give an hourglass figure! This is a cheap china &#34;corset&#34; with PLASTIC boning! Don't waste the money!
1.0,"I was so excited about getting this bracelet. It’s classy and simple, exactly what I was looking for. I had the bracelet on for an hour and it broke."
1.0,No elastic so they won’t stay up. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,My size... but did not fit.
1.0,This is not jasper. I’m not sure what it is. These are round beads and look nothing like they were advertised. I’m disappointed.
1.0,Would never purchase any of these. Very cheaply made. Turned my skin green.
1.0,Way bigger then expected
1.0,"I really wanted to love this sweatshirt. The fabric is soft, but unfortunately that’s about the only good thing I can say about it. The alien patch was oddly positioned and was practically in my armpit. The patch also wasn’t cut neatly or sewn on very well; it was very noticeable on the dark blue shirt because the stitching and the patch edging are both white. If the shirt had been a light color, this probably wouldn’t have been as noticeable. The cuffs were also a different shade of navy, which looked odd. Given all the high ratings this item has, maybe I was just unlucky. It’s going back. If you order this, I would definitely recommend going up a size if you want a sweatshirt-like fit."
1.0,The worst product I've ever ordered on Amazon. Very poorly made.
1.0,I didnt like the nylon type fabric or the fact the filters were made in China.
1.0,There was suppose to be a watch band tool. There was NOT!!!!
1.0,Broke easy and lost color too
1.0,Very cheap and doesn't look nice as the pictures don't waste your money buying this cheap thing
1.0,"I have size 14 feet.  I guess I should not have expected these to stay on my feet, but, if they won't, why sell them in that size?  They're terrible.  They absolutely will not stay . . . the heel always comes loose and ends up bunched under my foot.  Oh well, I guess I'll wear my shoes with no socks or socks that show . . . . what a terrible purchase."
1.0,"A total lost of money, gets dark just with touch it. Dissapointed."
1.0,"I'm a 38C. I could not wear a bra with this dress. It was super tight on my boobs, basically flattened them, and had a weird flap near the armpits. Not flattering."
1.0,Does not fit true to size. Too small.
1.0,there apparantly is no consistency with what they are sending....i recieved one with the straps going straight up the middle which gave for an odd look.. the top had a small peep hole not separate pieces with a upper adjoining strap...just was not satisfied...
1.0,"The hat would’ve been awesome, had it fit.  The sizing is way off.."
1.0,These were purchased for me off my wishlist. They arrived with one of the seed pearls rolling around in the package. Super glue I guess? Not worth the $5.99. I told the gal who gifted me to get her $ back
1.0,"The watch hands wasn’t moving, I don’t know if it came with battery’s or not"
1.0,Dress didn’t fit comfortably.
1.0,I gave this dress 1 star because of the Very Thin Cheap material and not at all what I expected!
1.0,They were too small one size doesn't fit all people
1.0,"The material was more like t-shirt feel.  It was way too small,  I wear an XL but ordered an XXL to be sure it would fit.  They sent an XL and it was so snug that you could see almost through the dress.  It looks great in the picture."
1.0,I wanted this shirt for the message printed on it. But  the Graphics choice was not good. The letter &#34;B&#34; is awful. I declined buying the shirt. The designer tried to get fancy and killed it.
1.0,"If I could give zero stars I would... The major problem with this piece is that the bottom doesn't open all the way. A small zipper supposedly allows for access to diapers however it doesn't easily go on and off your child. I was able to squeeze it on my kid, but could NOT get it off. I literally had to cut it off her. My daughter wears a size 90, so I know I bought the right size. Snaps, or a zipper that opened the entire bottom would have been fine..."
1.0,To cocky
1.0,"the band broke on the first day, when I put it on"
1.0,"The earrings are not Sterling silver, they are silver plated.  The earrings turned brown after 2 months of use."
1.0,"Goggles were too big, left too much space between the foam and the skin. Items were returned."
1.0,look like original.<br />after a day off use the springs in the handles didn't work.<br />the handles stays open<br />and endglasses falls off my face.<br />this is after I made a prescription lenses on these glasses.
1.0,"The ad plainly states these are &#34;POLARIZED&#34;.  These glasses are not polarized!  For any that do not know the simple test that you make let me educate you.  Take another polarized pair of sunglasses, put the two of them together and look through them---you should see through them fine---now turn one of the sunglasses down---all light should now be blocked out.  It is now impossible to see through them.  If the glasses are now black, and they block out all light then they are polarized.  If you can still see through them then they are not polarized lenses."
1.0,sleeves are way too long and the quality like when u wear for under amor not worth the cost very cheap materials that's why Im returning it today same day got it same day return
1.0,Peace of junk. Fur not real it's synthetic. Looks very cheap.
1.0,Don’t buy unless your pants have oversized belt loops
1.0,Very very very tight. I got a large and am normally a medium. This was so tight I couldn’t get it over my head or above my knees. I returned it.
1.0,If you don’t care about money this isn’t bad I guess.  I just happened to find them for a dollar a piece at the dollar store.  So I’m returning mine.
1.0,I ordered my size. I know my size. There is no way the correct size! Unfortunately clothes not made here don't accommodate the size ordered! Wish I didn't have to click on a star am disappointed.
1.0,Arrived with the face shield cracked in half. The red feathers on the top had like half the feathers fall out plus the feather mohock holder kept coming off.
1.0,"I bought this to wear to a wedding, I wanted a face mask that was also pretty. This is a complete waste and will provide all of zero protection against COVID or anything else. The back of the lace is a very thin knit with big holes. I expected the lace to be porous because it's lace but expected the backing to provide some protection - nope. Also, it's really uncomfortable, the lace trim sticks up in front touching eyes no matter what I do. So even if I thought it would be useful to wear, I would still choose any of the other masks I have. Do not buy!"
1.0,"I am 5'4, about a size 6-8 and size 34C bust. The neck on this dress is high and it makes me look HUGE from the bust to the waist. the length hits below the knee, so it just makes me look short and fat."
1.0,Bout for my daughters brand new watch and it would not stay hooked onto the watch. Her watch ended up hitting the floor and broke because of it.
1.0,"This drives me crazy on Amazon.... When you sell something - the picture NEEDS to match what you are sending out.<br /><br />I received these 2 stickers, but the train logo is different and the &#34;P&#34; is outlined in white and looks awful<br /><br />PRIME has its privileges - will be returning shortly"
1.0,"Waaaayyyy to short!! I am 5'3, 145 pounds and this only goes down to the waist band of my shorts. Nothing like the picture."
1.0,Falls down as you walk in them. Returned
1.0,The slide place strap holder broke after just 3 days of wearing.
1.0,"EVERY single zipper on this purse (and there are a lot!) is broken or sprung in some way. A couple are still usable after closing and opening again, but most are not working at all. It's really a shame because I love the color, the material, and the style, but the zippers are just unacceptable. I should have read the reviews before purchasing this purse."
1.0,My husband has had this ring for **3 DAYS** do not waste your time even looking at this ring.
1.0,I should have just bought a pack of V-neck white Ts and some cheap beach pants or something...But to be fair you get what you pay for
1.0,This product was sad. It was completely bare on the footbed. It looks fuzzy but it is not. The fuzzy was not even trimmed along the edge. Poor quality.
1.0,cheap! The chain is a lot larger with the loops of the chain making it look sooo cheap. Tarnished and turned my neck green. Don't bother!!!
1.0,Nice product but pin that holds it to ring broke after 2 days while it was in my pocket.
1.0,Made in China and see through. Didn’t even put them on and the seams were pulling apart. Do not waste your money
1.0,should have fit my toddler based on the measurements.
1.0,This was the worst item I have ever received from Amazon. It is so bad I will never order a clothing item again.I have never seen something so cheaply made
1.0,Cheap foreign made crap.
1.0,"This looks nice, however, when I received it, it was already broken."
1.0,It was way too small even though it said large.
1.0,First of all I got it early came on time open the box tried it on look so nice but every time when i walked it felt all the time now i don't like it anymore I jusr put it on my bathroom draw can't used it can't do nothing with it I'm not buying from the seller anymore nope nope deuces....
1.0,"Just more cheap plastic.  I kept my order and got a little over a years' use befor they came apart.  Had there been any real leather, probable wouldn't be writing this."
1.0,"It was horrible, made to fit a small child not an adult, fabric was like cheap plastic"
1.0,Yuck. Terrible fabric. It's itchy and nowhere near as beautiful as the picture. I looked Amish in it.
1.0,They sold inferior  stuff as  sterling  silver  watch is not. I bought  a wedding  set after two  months  the rings started  turning  black. I wouldn't  recommend  to buy from this seller . It's  is not true for the quality  they advertised
1.0,"Cute for a photograph but uncomfortable for every day wear. You can tell the material is low quality. I would not purchase again. In fact, I wish I could return them."
1.0,The silver color wore off the chain after only a few wears. Not good quality.
1.0,These mask are terrible. They have no nose peice. They are not comfortable at all. They are not stretchable. The worst mask I have purchased. They should have been 1$.
1.0,Don’t waste your money on it. Recommend to order a size bigger and I order 2 sizes bigger and it was still 3 sizes too small.
1.0,sweater shed the very first time it was worn. I have NEVER had such a cheap sweater.
1.0,the color and the style are not the same as the picture
1.0,I did not like the material i was under the assumption it would be more cottony it looks like a moomoo
1.0,This top runs small and it’s very low quality.
1.0,"sucks, frames were warped and glasses sat crooked on my face."
1.0,Bought a size M for my 12 yr old teen girl who usually wears kid size 12. And still the shirt is too small.
1.0,Very cheap unraveled right away
1.0,I ordered the size that I normally wear and I had to give them to my daughter.
1.0,Way too much money for the quality of the dress
1.0,Dislike. Will never order again. Rusted up in a short period of time.
1.0,Wayyyyyy too large
1.0,This dress looks much prettier in the picture. The material on the skirt is very heavy and looks cheap compared to the lace on the top. Not a dress to pick if you want something fancy. It also runs slightly large.
1.0,"Wayyyyyy to small, and it's not shaped for a curvy woman. The photo is false advertisement!"
1.0,These must be made for tiny women because I ordered the xl and it fit like a medium. Terrible chemical smell and cheap looking.
1.0,"I'm not sure who fills the orders for this company, but they sure dropped the ball. I ordered a size 6 and received boots that are at least two maybe three sizes too big!!! Really? And there was not a return form so I'm stuck with boots I cannot wear. I don't have a printer so trying to print a return label is not an option either. What a waste of money. Do what you want, take a chance if you want but that's what you'd be doing, taking a chance.  Just one buyer opinion."
1.0,One month after having these slippers there is already a hole in the bottom of the one slipper. I am highly dissatisfied. Pretty sad for just one month
1.0,Verrrrrry painful
1.0,This does not work at all I waisted my  money on this
1.0,Beautiful but heavier then anticipated
1.0,"This dress is much longer than depicted in the model photo and the material is much sheerer than depicted. It is almost transparent! I had high hopes for this dress because if it actually looked like what is in the picture it would be super cute, but unfortunately the actual product is very different. Size small is enormous."
1.0,Seller sent them opposite direction of my state so package was delayed and the top of one was broke as I put it in. So I changed to other ring and the top of it broke. Very very beautiful color but poorly made. Worst I’ve ever purchased in the 20 years I’ve had my naval pierced
1.0,"Just like the DJT tunic without the handkerchief hemline, this top is way too big in the waist and hips.  The shoulder fit is true to size, but the top is shapeless and not at all as pictured.  I just wrote a review on non-handkerchief hemline version and said the same thing.  The sleeves fit, but the rest of the shirt lacks shape and contour.  I was very, very disappointed.  I am returning it."
1.0,2 pairs broke in the same place on the frame within a day of having them
1.0,"Nice fit, but the stones are just waaay to smalllll!"
1.0,"Terrible bra. Poorly constructed. Very, VERY tiny. I read the reviews and all about the sizing. This is basically for a child."
1.0,"The &#34;gold&#34; looks way too fake and even though these are stacked rings for the tips of your fingers, they are all TOO small to even do that."
1.0,"These bracelets are very cheap looking. The color combination was horrible. Two bracelets in the bunch are just like Laura and Lily bracelets I have, however these look atrocious next to my Laura and Lily bracelets. These 6 bracelets couldn't look any more cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"When I received the watch set, it was missing one color band and had two of another color.  I didn't need two black bands and I wanted the red!"
1.0,It’s a cute style but not in white. You can see through the white. It’s a little thin.
1.0,Nothing like the picture very disappointed
1.0,"I bought this item for my 3.5 year old grandson. Although it arrived quickly, it is being returned immediately. The quality of the terry is so poor-thin, shabby, shear. The length bearly comes to the top of his knees. A size 6 was way too small in the chest although he normally wears a size 4 in regular clothing. Sorry, but this item is definitely not worth the price."
1.0,Super disappointed with these pants. I had previously purchased the same pants in black and they fit perfectly so I wanted another pair but in a different color. I ordered the same size but they did not fit the same at all. These pants were significantly smaller and shorter. So annoyed.
1.0,Definitely NOT water proof.
1.0,The front and back are not even whatsoever. Wears extremely crooked.
1.0,I was very disappointed. The necklace does NOT look like the picture. The &#34;stone&#34;  looks like a piece of blue glass or plastic. I have no fault with the metal part of the necklace. It is interesting....different. I will find something to do with this piece.
1.0,quality was terrible...seam started coming undone after one wear.
1.0,Looks nice but it’s very cheaply made. Metal clasp had a coating that flaked off within a few days. Wouldn’t buy again.
1.0,Very disappointed. Returning this shirt.  Runs very small and instead of being a heathered grey it's just a flat grey. I normally wear an xl so I sized up to a 2x wanting it to be oversized and comfy... without being washed yet it was already tight. Also while I love a lightweight sweater shirt this was so thin that I would worry that a bra would be seen through the fabric as well.
1.0,"We bought this polish for some white dress shoes that had been scuffed. The polish went on very lightly and despite buffing for a long time, didn’t cover up the scuffs."
1.0,Received item today but the chain securing (lock) part doesnt work. I cant even open it to put it on. I'll be asking for a refund.
1.0,The size was incorrect and wayctoo small
1.0,"Very dissatisfied with this product. It is more for toddlers, its a real tiny umbrella with poor quality.  Recieved my product and it was tearing at the seam and barely covered my kiddos head!"
1.0,"I ordered a large, fit like a small. Returned."
1.0,"Bib was so thin and all were folded together. Was difficult to get apart  and so flimsy, tying it was almost impossible.<br />Top layer was tissue thin and was not absorbent enough. would not recommend for any use and will not order again."
1.0,"Quality was terrible! You get what you pay for. These arrived bent, twisted and generally unwearable."
1.0,"These were AWFUL. I don't know what the good reviews were sent, but what I received was worse quality than what I'd expect from a vending machine. Cheap, light plastic with sharp edges. I decided to give them a shot anyway.. They were a huge pain in the ass to put in and the posts were so flimsy they were bending as I was trying to put them in.  My piercings ended up BLEEDING and swollen from the cheap edges of the posts. Save your money and your ears."
1.0,"I didn’t have a problem with wrinkles like so many wrote…they pretty much fell out after hanging a couple days BUT the smell of it was awful.  Every time I walked by the hanging jacket on the door…wow.  I gave  it close to 2 weeks the returned.  Too bad, it was cute for the price."
1.0,Not true to size. Tan small
1.0,Very cheaply made. Got all fuzzy and can’t wear
1.0,This ishow the product arrived. Very disappointed. No I did not remove it from the cardboard it came like that and already broke. It was for my niece who turned 6. Also sad it does not open. Would make it more authentic if it did. Did not get it in time for the party now I'm glad with this quality.
1.0,"Question for Zattcas company :<br />I purchased the pistachio colour, Bohemian floral tiered maxi dress, received it with no label to state the type of material. I am extremely allergic to polyester, and it does feel like polyester material. I am unable to return the dress should it be polyster because it has been shipped out of the USA.<br />I bought the dress after reading the seller’s Zattcas company answer to a customers question.<br />What is the material?<br />Hi, it is made by 100% rayon, thank you<br />By Zattcas company SELLER  on March 8, 2021<br />When sellers advertise their products the details should be 100% correct, consider those with allergies and it would also elevate customers having to return goods.<br />Please confirm what material this dress ??????"
1.0,"The M bottoms are a bit roomy and the M top is wayyy too small. I'm 5'5 and slim, pretty evenly portioned. I wear a size 4. And 34C. My guess is I'd need an L top and a S bottom to fit this properly. That's a first..."
1.0,Esta demasiado peqeña
1.0,I had this lanyard for less than a week and it’s fall apart already. Very disappointed.
1.0,"not the material pictured, no pocket. not low cut v neck, its high. very disappointing, but not worth it to send back. cheap looking."
1.0,Material was nothing like what is pictured.  Sizing was off.  Looks like a cheap material<br />Will not use<br />Very disappointed
1.0,Irritated my daughter's skin under her arms immediately from sequins rubbing and the skirt part fell apart the first time she wore it. She can't get a second wear out of it and wouldn't put it back on if she could. Too uncomfortable. Looked pretty and fit as expected but very disappointed.
1.0,Light but the fabric bleeds and the shorts are so big they look like a cheap skirt
1.0,My husband wanted another Kobe shirt that unfortunately is unavailable. I bought him these thinking they were similar lol no the size large could fit our 5 year old daughter. I do not recommend at all
1.0,I wanted to wear this as a ring. Along with my puzzle rings and ring of evil eyes my hands would've been complex philosophical intrigue. But it didn't happen. It isn't a wearable on my fingers and too heavy around my neck. But still very philosophical
1.0,I was not happy. The necklace came with a different chain than in the picture.  Very flimsy.
1.0,Im pretty tolerating of cheap metal... but this is garbage metal. I can get an hour out of these before my ears hurt.
1.0,"I dislike it because it’s says that,it’s a short sleeve summer dress but when it came it’s not as described,it was just a top,it wasn’t a dress,that’s why I  rated one ,infact I don’t like it."
1.0,"Arm too small , not made with good material tore easy"
1.0,Cheaply made. The first time I unlatched the earring to put it in my ear it broke. I wish so much time hadn't passed so I could return them.
1.0,"Not good at all. This looks NOTHING like the photo so don’t be fooled. Also, runs a bit big.<br />I am 4’11” 130 pounds, ordered M and was way long and big around the top and chest area."
1.0,Beautiful and trendy.  I plan to buy some more for my granddaughters.
1.0,Way too small but cute.
1.0,"Looks much better in the picture, I could have bought this in the dollar store, very disappointed, chain is a good lengthe but not good quality. Stone is pretty but not good quality. Too much trouble to return. Adding to my &#34;poor choice&#34; box. I had to give a star to give my review, but my real rate is zero stars."
1.0,This item runs VERY VERY SMALL...Terrible fit...size chart was not accurate. Could not use this item
1.0,This is not red. its pink
1.0,Magnet isn’t strong enough. Not worth the money
1.0,"Like many other similar products sold here, the terms ""genuine leather"" ""real leather"" and even ""100% leather"" have no meaning when describing the product. It's always a whole lot of non-leather material sandwiched (best case scenario) between 2 thin layers of leather. Returning."
1.0,"I do not recommend these bands.  After wearing the watch everyday for about 1 month, 2 have broken where the pin attaches the band to the Fitbit."
1.0,"I should have heeded the other sellers' comments. These are WAY too narrow for a man to wear. My husband is 160lbs and these are very tight, so much so, he can't put them on over his size 9 foot. There is no ""give"" in the elastic. Returned both our orders."
1.0,I just finished sewing the zipper back on the coin purse part of the wallet due to it just zipping off the edge. Nothing there to stop it from happening.
1.0,"This runs about 2 sizes smaller than you'd think. Waste of money, I even got a size bigger just in case it ran small and even then it was too small."
1.0,Super cheap quality.  Not sweatshirt material. Not even a tag on it.
1.0,Beautiful but terrible quality. They turned my nipples green within a few days.
1.0,My mother in law wore them one time and the post broke.  Gave them to her as a present. Now she hates me.  She thinks I bought her cheap imitations.
1.0,Too small for big hear like mine.
1.0,Not sure what foot model they used for the &#34;shoe size 13-15&#34;. Toddlers maybe?  Absolutely do not fit my 14½ size feet.
1.0,"I think I would have liked this but it came to me damaged and wasn't worth sending it back because of the cheap price. So, I just have a broken piece of jewelry."
1.0,"This item looked great but was disappointing. Basket weave belting stretched significantly, as did the elastic in the back. It got to the point that the bulky buckles were just a tad shy of the top of my shoulders, making them painful and unwearable. I am 5' 10&#34;."
1.0,Way to small! Order up and very flimsy material
1.0,Beware - This bra has the same cup size regardless of the size you order. My XXL and XL came with an A or small B cup size. I normally wear a 38 to 40 D cup bra size. I ordered an XL and a XXL to see which fit better. I took the bra out of the package and thought I had bought a training bra it was so small. It was ridiculous and not at all what was described.
1.0,"The fabric was cheap and rough, so I sent them back."
1.0,Veryyyy poor quality. The watch lasted me only about 2 months and stopped working. Very unsatisfied with the poor quality.
1.0,Did not look attractive on me
1.0,The rocks were nothing like the picture weird sizes and shapes and a lot of deep cracks .
1.0,Waited almost a month for it and it broke the fist day.
1.0,This shirt was not a sweatshirt material. Was very cheaply made. Was very unhappy with the quality.
1.0,The beacj
1.0,"I did not like this robe.  Not only was it much to small, (despite me purchasing it a few sizes to large based on other reviews) but the fabric felt cheap and it looked like it would be easily torn.  The seams were sloppy and the belt lacked any loops to keep it on, but was to short to really get a good tight tie to get it to stay up.<br /><br />100% dissappointed, and it's is shipping back."
1.0,Quality is not good waste to buy  & its made in made in china products!!!!
1.0,I did not get a bracelet... This is misleading all I got was a small necklace that is so simple...very disappointed!!!
1.0,"Not as it in photos, don't buy!!"
1.0,Awful! Zipper came broke and the colors are not the same as show in the picture. I returned it the same day I received the purse.
1.0,Cheap plastic looking didn’t wear it
1.0,"Holy cow, people. What size measurements are you USING? I ordered a large (what I normally wear as I like oversized shirts, and most L's are big on me), and it's waaaay too small. As in, too small for me to even get it over my head. As in, wow -- that's not a large, that's a SMALL. People, get real with your women's sizes. This was ridiculous.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'd tossed all the packing material away and waited a few days before trying it on, so now doing a return is out of the question. But I'm not buying from this vendor again, and I recommend that others avoid them. If you absolutely must have this shirt, order at least TWO sizes up from what you normally wear."
1.0,"Arrived with a hole in the butt. Cheap, thin material"
1.0,It was big enough to fit a toddler. Don’t even bother ordering
1.0,The ring was beautiful for a few days. After about a week it turned my son's girlfriend's finger green and it lost its color. It looks almost bronze. I am very disappointed with this ring
1.0,You need like a xxxl if you normally wear large. The fit is waaaay to short as well. I guess i expected differently.
1.0,Do not buy this!!! Worse buy I've ever done..looks nothing like the pic.its like buying from WISH
1.0,"I love the way the product looks. However, it smells TERRIBLE. Best description would be heavy cigarette smoke mixed with Salami or something. I let it air out over night and it didn't lose any smell. It smells so terrible I won't be able to use it :( Very disappointed because it's so cool to look at"
1.0,If u plan on buying this then plan on keeping it because to return it needs to be sent to China and u won’t be able to afford that shipping price.
1.0,"The size I ordered would normally have been too big, so it would be loose. However these weren't even true to size. But even smaller!!! They are denim but it's paper thin?"
1.0,First of all I ordered the Heather blue not the mint. And most of all it came with TWO STAINS?!??!?!! what the heck kind of place is this?? I see the reviews where they arrive with holes?! What did I just buy????
1.0,Literally started  falling apart at the seems the same day that I received it
1.0,"The color was fantastic and I was so excited to receive this piece, was very disappointed that this did not fit and the part of the sweater in the picture where it comes to a point near the wrist of the sweater was huge!  Looking at the picture I thought nothing of this because I figured it is where the hips would fit and it was not.  I returned this product."
1.0,"BS.<br />“Made in USA.” However, all the packaging, including address shipped from, was in Chinese..."
1.0,no don't get this item if your a large. I got two sizes one xxl and one xl. the xl fits better than the xxl?!? they both don't even fit me and I'm a medium. Its a cute shirt but I doesn't fit. I wouldn't buy if you a medium/large because it fits so terribly.
1.0,the band didn't even last three months before it broke
1.0,"Heavy and somewhat cheap. Not what expected, returned."
1.0,It got knits on it after two days of wearing it
1.0,The belt was moldy!
1.0,Lettering was cheap and seemed like it would quickly peel off so returned it.
1.0,Their cheap
1.0,It's cheap and flawed!
1.0,I can not believe how thin this jacket is. It is more of<br />a Fall in between jacket rather than a heavy snow jacket for my grandson to play in. Returning it.<br />Very disappointing!
1.0,"Too thin, and cheap looking. I end up using yoga mat instead. Home Depot sales similar product by the foot."
1.0,I had to take it to the tailor to take it in.Horrible quality not nice
1.0,Very poor quality of material product
1.0,It will turn ur finger green. Plated cheap. Not worth it.
1.0,I usually wear an x-small but due to reviews I ordered a Medium they fit like a sports bra I am soooo disappointed because they are extremely cute but no way the sizing is accurate.
1.0,The rag was cut out and there was loss strings around the neck line. To big for my Granddaughter.  I'm 80 years old now I have find a new gift and try and return. I shop on line so I don't have to go to the big box store.  Not happy. Will not buy from this person ever again<br />Virginia
1.0,"UPDATE:<br />I have ordered this TWICE now in a large. The receipt says large and everything. TWICE NOW Amazon has sent me a MEDIUM. THE MEDIUM ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT FIT, IT WILL NEVER FIT. I don't have many long pants and was hoping to get these for this week, but now I've realized I obviously cannot get these pants in the proper size. On top of that, Amazon doesn't offer any kind of support for resolving this issue. If you decide to buy these, GOOD LUCK getting your size. I'm so done with this mess. And of course, Amazon won't offer me the same return options for both pairs. So I will have to go to two completely different stores in order to return these. Seriously??? Amazon has gone to crap.<br /><br />I ordered this in a size Large, because people say it shrinks in the wash, and I wanted a slightly loose fit anyway. However, Amazon sent me a Medium. So now I have to go through the process of a return and wait even longer for my pants (hopefully they get this one right).<br /><br />These pants clearly had a tag on the inside, but it was cut off, and a cardboard tag was clipped to the pants. That seems kind of shady to me. I'm not really sure what to think about that. The material is pretty thin, but stretchy. I hope the large size doesn't shrink too much in the wash, because they will need to be loose enough to fit leggings under for warmth. They will be great for wearing in the summer, though.<br /><br />I am very thin, no hips, 115lbs at most, and the medium barely fit me. The waist and butt was larger, but the legs were crazy tight. If I were to put these in the wash, they would never fit again. These are ONLY for very thin people!!! For tall people,  the length seemed a little longer than most Asian sizes. I'm 5'4"", mostly legs, and I had maybe an extra inch or two to spare. They also come up pretty high at the waist, so some people might like that fact.<br /><br />Overall, these seem pretty decent, but nothing stellar for the price. I'm glad I waited to buy these until they offered a coupon. I could, however, see myself wearing them a lot (assuming I get the right size)."
1.0,I didn’t like the polarized affect on these glasses. When you wear them it makes everything look different then in reality. Makes my head hurt after wearing them a while. I wouldn’t recommend if your looking for good sunglasses.
1.0,"I returned these immediately. There was a visible seam on the bottom ball of the earring that was very obviously plastic, not sterling. Disappointing because they were cute and dainty."
1.0,Less than 24 hrs  the non-valet piece fell off. Spring and tiny screw came out. No tools I have small enough to put it back together. I've had these types before and they had no issues. This one though is terrible. Would not buy it !!
1.0,The handle broke the first week of purchase. The handle is too thin and fragile.
1.0,"Unfortunately, this item was made with very cheap material, it broke when i tried to put it on my shoes. Don't buy it."
1.0,It has an opening between the legs
1.0,"I didn't like the material of the top, it feels more like a T-shirt/cheap with all this extra material. Its not flattering to the arms with the added material as you move around. I had ordered an XL since I don't like fitted tops."
1.0,"This is junk! Over priced, poorly made. Go to the dollar store instead!!!"
1.0,Way smaller than expected :(
1.0,T shirt is soft and color is nice but size is way smaller than expected.  The shirt is short.
1.0,I received this item today and it doesn't work super upset because I really liked this watch no to mention it won't let me choose replacement it will only let me do a refund and I don't want a refund I just want them to send me another one
1.0,This blouse is a bad joke!  Sleeves holes are TINY.Bust line is LARGE.  Mid section close to sizing.  Bottom would only fit a child.  Material is so thin I can see my hand through it!  DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY
1.0,I ordered a boys large for big kids...10-12...and I got a size 4!
1.0,"Material is too thin. Almost see through, waste of money."
1.0,Cheap! It broke before I could even out it on my watch.
1.0,"Ordered a XL at first didn’t even make it past my calf. Ordered the next size up, doesn’t fit right and the zipped popped. Cheap quality"
1.0,Not for the curves
1.0,"The color was beautiful, but the swim suit didn’t remotely fit my torso.  It was like they made the suit big enough around but didn’t lengthen it. The cups were down by my lower ribcage even with shoulder adjustment."
1.0,Very disappointed chain was not what I expected very cheap lookin was not happy at all and will not be ordering from this seller again at least not a chain!!!!!!!!
1.0,These may be the worst product I have ever purchased. After about 2 months they look like they have fly ash over them. Remarkably bad. Cannot even see out of them.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4d7a0552595350b5bcf1a9a7161d92b2]] Item had three big holes in it when I open the package
1.0,The shirts aren't horrible but they are poor quality. One of them had two decent sized holes in it before I even put it on and if you stretch the material even slightly around the area they start ripping way more. I bought a set of these shirts from a different brand around the same time last year and they are all in perfect condition. I only bought from this company because they had the color I wanted but i can tell a big difference in the quality of material and they were the same price
1.0,It doesn’t have seams on top and bottom. Is easily stretched out. I found that just pulling them over heads was enough to make it just slide off your face. Ended up just a pile of trash.
1.0,"This is not what I envisioned this to be. I am 5’3” and this looks like an extra long dress on me. Unfortunately, this will remain my closet because I cannot locate the tag to return it."
1.0,Does not fit right. Wish I could get something else
1.0,"supposed to be 2xl, I'd say about a medium"
1.0,This bra is awful not a true cup size the straps constantly slide down. Don’t waste your money
1.0,"I can't use the majority of these because of either scratches in the glass, or tiny chips, or dings. You have to look closely to see them but that's kinda the point for what they are being used for"
1.0,"Came with 2014 Tassel, should have been described as such."
1.0,Way to big wrong size not fitted like the pic. Good if youre over 200lb.
1.0,Cute design but very poor quality. The white bead on one of the earrings was very off center. The gold &#34;metal&#34; portion was plastic. I guess you get what you paid for. Definitely returning and will look for this design that is better made.
1.0,"I loved the look of this dress bought a small, my normal size and it was too small. Returned snd ordered a medium and it’s twice as small as the small size. Makes no sense. I give up. Will not be ordering again. Sizes are too mixed up."
1.0,I love Sunflowers and was looking for this type of scarf/mask.  It was very tight and I had extreme difficult getting this over my head.  It was difficult to breathe through and wear due to tightness.
1.0,Returned. Not what i expected
1.0,Only received One set...
1.0,I fallowed the size chart and nope these I can't even put over my calf and there a large<br />Disappointed I bought for work<br /> Hassle to send back so my 14 year old can wear them<br />Don't deserve the star but it makes you!<br />Unacceptable to force a star when it don't deserve one
1.0,"It is a cute top, but the size 2x would fit a 12 year old. It is tiny. I am donating it, because it’s easier than returning it."
1.0,"looks very flat, it doesn't look like what's offered, it is a xerox copy inside the clear ball... Very disappointed."
1.0,Junk. Painted ...color comes off
1.0,"Ordered two pairs because they awesome price and good reviews but they were a disappointment. The toe box is straight and leaves a lot of extra fabric on both sides. I walk 10 miles a day, five days a week for work and can't afford to miss a day because a poorly constructed sock rubbed me raw.  They also don't go as high as I expected, maybe 2/3 of the leg is covered. Not impressed and returning them for my trusty Sockwell socks."
1.0,"I absolutely love this! It's so soft, flattering and comfy. That being said, I've worn it a hand full of times and already the lacey parts are torn and have HUGE holes. I know it was inexpensive, but still, I'd like to get more than 5 wears out of it. :("
1.0,The style was ok but sizing and material wise not what I expected waaaaayyyyyyy too big not impressed at all
1.0,"It's very cheaply made, the ring that holds the chain to the key part was coming apart and the picture is blurry. Would not recommend this at all."
1.0,What the heck are these? The ears are so close together it is comical. Waste of money
1.0,"Unfortunately, the fabric pilled up on the first wear and looked old.  Fine for lounging, but not for wearing outside the house."
1.0,Fits like a regular hoodie and not as advertised in the image. Returning this product.
1.0,Not true to size and was very short
1.0,Poor quality. It ripped at the first try. The stitching is weak
1.0,it was odd
1.0,Not at all as picture. Greatly disappointed and the wait to receive this was longer than expected
1.0,"Based on the “quality for money” aspect, I am terribly disappointed with this product. Very cheap material. I ordered the black one and within just 10 days, color got worn off."
1.0,"I was very disappointed that after only a few times of wearing these, the supposed cushion was almost flat. And they weren't all that comfortable to begin with. I should have returned them."
1.0,So incredibly tiny! It barely fit my pinky.
1.0,The picture was like it look but the top kept sliding down I was uncomfortable
1.0,Cant be surgical steel. Turned my skin green. The flower and size was nice
1.0,"I did like the design but i did not like it because it look shiny and it look chip plastic ,, I don't recommend"
1.0,"Very loose fit on the small. After a wash the already short legs just ride up and make it so they’re no longer boxer briefs, but briefs with excess fabric to bunch in uncomfortable areas.<br />The fabric is nice, but the fit is beyond poor."
1.0,Costume jewelry. Want a refund but it’s not worth returning.
1.0,This item is the worst quality item!  Both items are so cheaply printed you can barely see what the image is!!
1.0,Hard to slide on arms
1.0,My husband bought these for support for his back because he does physical labor.  He tried one on and it did not have any support whatsoever.  We returned them.
1.0,Extremely too small and missing a screw in the process now to return
1.0,"Just simply not long at all, more like a bralette."
1.0,I have ordered these pants without the zipper pockets and they fit great.  I got these in the tall length and the waist is huge compared to the same size in different style
1.0,The neck stitching pulled apart after first wash
1.0,This cheap vest broke within the first few weeks of wearing it. Do not buy
1.0,Muy pequeño Gracias
1.0,"None of the backs fit properly, the post are to small for the backs. I can't find another back that will work."
1.0,Ripped the first day I wore it. Would not recommend! I want a full refund!!! So disappointed!
1.0,I like how I order something and receive the WRONG item. I ordered the red champion hoodie that read CHAMPION ACROSS THE CHEST. I got a red hoodie with a small champion sign!! Extremely disappointing.
1.0,I’ve seen nicer jewelry come out of a Pizza Hut gum ball machine andddd it arrived broken in not one but two places !!! Who would want to wear this garbage on their wedding day !
1.0,Experience allergic reactions after day 3 of wearing the earrings.
1.0,This dress was sent looking SIMILAR to the pic shown🙄.<br />I need to just give up on these products.<br />Sleeves or short with a cheap button add for detail.<br />That detail on the side😣
1.0,Didn’t get both necklace and bracelet as description clearly stated. Returned for refund
1.0,ugh. ugly and a huge disappointment
1.0,These are not linen and they are not as pictured. These are like the pants you would purchase at your local giant blue/yellow superstore on the clearance rack for $1 in the seniors section.
1.0,I have a fairly short torso (I am all legs) and this shirt was more like a belly shirt.  Waste of money!!  Don't buy unless you plan on wearing it as a belly shirt.
1.0,"This is a very breathable mask... admittedly doesn't protect you from much but does get you in the stores. Things started going down hill after washing it, which is when it fades and begins to get those little balls around the stitching. Also wish the branding was a bit smaller."
1.0,This is the weirdest sweater I've ever put on.  Took me a good while to figure out which side was the top.  Color was nice but that is about the only good thing I can say.  It went back immediately.
1.0,This was a 3x for male doll baby not a man.
1.0,"Loved the dress, I got so many compliments. However, the first time I washed it, the strap broke."
1.0,"These are anti-glare glasses with no magnification. Ordered black, received white. Returned."
1.0,Just got these in the mail. One hoop os so tarnished it looks more in the color range of smoke grey...not silver. Very disappointed.
1.0,Engañada
1.0,These earrings in my opinion are not worth the price including the shipping cost<br /> They very tiny the post and backs are very thin . The backs are loose and don't stay on . The purchase of these earrings was a waste of my money . It would cost more to return them than they are worth . Do not buy these earrings you'll waste your money !!
1.0,I don't like it...Sorry..
1.0,"I would give this shirt half a star if I could. The only redeeming factor is that as advertised, it is a shirt and 100% cotton. It is NOT a flannel shirt and laundered like it is canvas. Still stiff only with a lot more deep, hard wrinkles. I've had dress shirts come out of the dryer less wrinkled. I'd return it if I hadn't washed it but will probably just donate it as I'm not going to iron a casual shirt.  Don't waste your money like I did!!!"
1.0,"I ordered 2 pairs and I couldn't believe that both sets ,every one (4) of them are broken. So disappointed with the first but then the second. Unbelievable and I originally both them for gifts."
1.0,The ring does not stay clasped.
1.0,Wasn't able to adjust these aprons that well.  Good for people who are tall.
1.0,Disappointed.  This necklace was much bigger than I anticipated.  It looked very inexpensive.  The catch on it didn't work at all.<br />Have to return it.
1.0,kids is way too small and adults too big.
1.0,Just got these and the lens on the left side has already popped out. Not happy at all with this purchase.
1.0,Husband didn't like this belt. The description says it's leather but it felt very much like plastic.
1.0,Fell apart after one washing
1.0,After wearing them 1 day at work the right cargo pocket ripped half way down at the seam. Continued to wear them and a week later the top right pocket got a hole in the bottom. And nothing sharp was in my pockets either. I just got them and 2 pockets became unusable already. Go with another brand
1.0,"I don't know if it was a production error, but these were at least two sizes too small, and I just gave them away."
1.0,These shirts shrank the first washing. Ordered a large (which should be a size 14-16) after washing they are more a size 8-10. I have never seen anything shrink this much.
1.0,"Requested large, got small"
1.0,Thought I was buying 3 got one ! I should have read the reviews ! Not the only one who thought this ☹️
1.0,"The material is so cheaply made, not stretchy, let alone flowy. It is not true to size and it was not comfortable to wear. Thin and see through material."
1.0,"Ran small, poor quality"
1.0,I expected it to look or fit similar to how it did on the model. I ordered XL. It fit like a medium especially in the arms. My husband had to pull it off me.
1.0,"Horrible decal. Came in a padded envelope that was folded in half in my mailbox, which creased one of the decals and ruined it. They are horrible quality decals. They’re sticky on both sides for some reason, which makes application nearly impossible. Once you get it applied, it collects dirt and dust like nothing else because it’s sticky and feels more like paper than a sticker"
1.0,Broke soon after purchase. The winding mechanism sticks and causes the hands to move even when pushed in to the proper position so the slightest hand moving while wearing it causes the hands to move... I do not recommend this watch.
1.0,Cheap it just falls off
1.0,The bra was soft. The bra was pretty. The bra allowed the ladies to plop out from the bottom and go party with my navel!  This band of this bra had no strength whatsoever. It was so overly stretchy that it was pretty much useless for trying to hold the twin beauties in place.
1.0,Not worth the trouble!
1.0,Made of very poor quality
1.0,Don't even bother if you want something that looks like any of the depictions of this dress you have seen. This is a poorly made reproduction and is literally just a thin cotton shift with a string for a belt. I couldn't return this fast enough.
1.0,I've gotten things for 99 cent that didn't break before I can get them to my ear
1.0,Broke after a 2 weeks of steady use.
1.0,"product was ordered bigger than normal size and is still way to small, I have no way to return item because I do not have access to a printer....I will no longer be ordering clothing of any type through amazon"
1.0,"This is probably the worst quality piece of clothing I have gotten from Amazon. The material is awful. It is reminiscent of the fuzzy polyester that Halloween costumes are made of. The collar is awkwardly sewn to the inside label which makes it a strange fit and causes it to button funny. Don’t even get me started on the awful buttonhole. The color reminded me of cat food pate’ that you get from the can. My photos don’t do justice to how bad the color is.  There are so many things wrong with this. Overall, it’s just terrible."
1.0,"The hat was way too big. second, one of the ears was much larger than the other! Through it away waist of money..... I will not purchase again from amazon other than music....."
1.0,"Bought these for my husband. Followed directions on washing them. After 2 wears 2 out of 3 pairs got a hole in them.<br /><br />There was no problem with the shoes he wore prior to these socks causing a wear, and he recently trimmed his toe nails to prevent them from damaging the socks. Not worth the money."
1.0,"--If this review helped you, please click ""helpful""--<br /><br />This dress is TEENY! So teeny that I didn't attach pictures because I was sure they'd get flagged for being indecent.<br /><br />I read the reviews about how small this was so I ordered a size up from my normal size. I usually go with a small but instead ordered a medium. WOW! It still was so tiny! I wouldn't have even worn this to a night club, it was so short and revealing.<br /><br />I'm 5'6"", 140 lbs, size 4, and curvy. I think a large or extra-large would have fit but I don't want to take the gamble. It's not cute enough to me to be worth the guessing game and all that effort. Oh well!<br /><br />--For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--"
1.0,These nike boots are FAKE!!! I repeat Fake save your money. Please do the leather is fake people
1.0,Not happy with at all lenses didn't fit well
1.0,This was huge! Fit an adult large head on the smallest setting. Disappointed!
1.0,Poor looking quality. Looks like crape paper
1.0,Band sucks too hard to close and open
1.0,This dress has a side zipper. It will not zip up if you are an average width.
1.0,"This is another item I bought at Amazon and was extremely disappointed. Both broke, the charms fell off and without them the brackets pretty much pointless"
1.0,I order a lot of mini dresses because at almost 6 ft tall I can wear them as tunics or tops. But this dress is definitely a top. Not even a tunic on my tall frame. So buyer beware.
1.0,I ordered an extra large for my husband. It barely fits my daughter n shes an adult small
1.0,The sole totally tore away from the boot. Shoe repair can't fix it. Won't buy again. Liked them at first.
1.0,Not what I was expecting when I ordered. They were super small and wouldn't even fit my 8 year old they were that small.
1.0,Returned them. They didn’t look anything like the picture and the quality wasn’t as sturdy I thought they would be
1.0,"Loved these when I first got them, fit perfect and feel like great quality. Unfortunately after only 3 wears, washing on delicate cycle and line drying the seams on the back and a seam on the left leg is unraveling. I wanted to love these"
1.0,Cheap plastic that is not threaded in a way you can open or close. Picture is printed on there and not even well. Not at all like the photo
1.0,"One of the shoes does not have green light, the other one does. We tried everything, pressing all of the buttons on the shoe and the remote, but no luck.."
1.0,"This dress did not include the pictured belt, which is problematic because it has big obvious belt loops. Also, there was no tag, although it looked like there was a spot for the tag. I can’t remember how neatly it was folded in the package, but it certainly seems like this was a used dress."
1.0,"Why can’t you be a boy and a good human? Crossing off Boy like it’s a bad thing. Boys should be boys and act like it so they become men. This is what society does and then woman want to know why their sons or their boyfriends won’t act like a man and take care of his family and have a job, be a father, open a door. They’ve gotten the message since the day they were born that being male is bad and aggressive and and everytime they show male traits they are punished. Keep trying to feminize boys and they won’t act like hero’s, this shirt is another message that says  acting like a boy is not being a good human. So sad."
1.0,"Did not work for me. I could not get any clarity, with a lot of adjustment, and my eyes would not co-ordinate together with them on."
1.0,I ordered an xl and received a 4x that fit like an xl. The waist band is very loose and does not stay up and it rolls up around the thighs too. Very cheap see-through material and very uncomfortable. Would not recommend.
1.0,Washed 2xs now and is leaving ink stains on my cloths blanket and on my skin wish I could get my money back
1.0,too small only can pull a few loops together.
1.0,Very uncomfortable shoes.  Definitely the worst Nike shoes ever purchased.
1.0,"the white ones had specs in them like they were made in a dirty mold, and the flares were all rough and had extra stuff hanging off of them. They were also SUPER hard not squishable at all"
1.0,The glasses are big and the sides don’t cover enough
1.0,Missing one arm band.
1.0,Impossible to put on.
1.0,"No entregan el producto por el cual pague,  me dieron uno de otro material y de fabricación China, que no cuesta ni la mitad del que me cobraron"
1.0,I have used money clips all my life this one is the worst I have ever had. I quit using it. I got taken on this item.
1.0,Didn’t fit. Terrible quality. Not cute and not like the picture.
1.0,"Sorry, but the bracelet was way too large, even for an adult. The symbol is too big and bulky and looked really bad on my wrist. Regret buying it, but at least it was cheap."
1.0,"My boyfriend got me this dress for a weekend getaway and its super cute but I have a lot of chest and was pooling out the top, so not super appropriate for this event."
1.0,"These were small and cute , but the holes and backs are not compatible with each other.  I didn’t get to wear these an hour before they fell off!"
1.0,Definitely not quality and this 3X is more like a 1X or XL. Am returning!
1.0,A very cheesy shirt. don't waist your money. I feel embarrassed even to give it away to someone.
1.0,I ordered a size up but yet it is too small. You have to go 3 sizes up. Quality is very bad as well - too thin and rough
1.0,La tela no es como se ve en la imagen y la tela se arrruga terrible
1.0,Wasn't quite what I expected makes your pants go sideways.
1.0,Beautiful but they were broke when they arrive
1.0,Was To Small
1.0,"Cute, but very scratchy material.  Doubt I'll ever wear it"
1.0,Size is not supported. Looked like they would fit a 6 year old. Returned for refund.
1.0,The medium size is tight so I re order large size. The large size comes but it was the same size as medium????<br />Seems like someone has returned it.  I can smell perfume.
1.0,"The Sooko car key chain ring is not even so so, it is a cheaply made trinket, this item is not worth $8.00, may be $1.49. The item is poorly made and it came apart with less than a week's use. Don't buy this item unless you don't care about your keys...."
1.0,Bought this for my teenage granddaughter to use while playing basketball. Fits snugly when she puts it on but slides off during the game. Lots of comments from the stands during the game. Now she doesn’t use it.
1.0,A man's baseball cap.  The original bebe is a woman's hat which fits better.  This one has a long and wide flap. Sits too high in the head. The back is impossible to to reinsert to accommodate a pony tail.
1.0,Didn't like the hang
1.0,"As a nurse, I have gone through many pairs of, both over-eyeglasses, and regular PPE safety glasses. Most of them have been disappointing, but these have been the worst. I finally found the holy grail of PPE glasses: Mr. Sandy is by far the best that I have found. Do yourself a favor. Go straight to the good ones."
1.0,This watch wasn't worth the $8 I spent. I bought it on Monday and it didn't last through the weekend. I got what I paid for. I do not recommend this watch.
1.0,Not great. Material is not what I was expecting and they run small.
1.0,"VERY disappointed! Not stylish at all, they're flat and fits on my face like a board."
1.0,"Cheap made, Very poor quality, poorly made sewing and customer service is the worst, they don't even answer.  I paid almost $60 for nothing. I should have gone to the local outlets I should get 3 better dresses with that money.  I don't recommend this."
1.0,Then pendant looks to cheap to wear with a nice dress.......
1.0,"Put both straps on watch.  That went fine.<br />When put on wrist and the buckle fell apart.  Put it back together did it again. The pin on the buckle is too short for how they drilled/made the holes on the U of the buckle.<br />The buckle strap was not the one that wore out, so put the OEM/original back on and the watch is back in service. The rubber parts seem good.  Was able to stretch the keeper over the OEM buckle, so the new hole strap won't get bent and break like the OEM one did after the OEM keeper failed."
1.0,Poor material and has no shape to them
1.0,Does not match the measurements stated in the description. Very disappointing.
1.0,I lost it because the clasp do not work properly
1.0,"Arrived damaged, frames were bent"
1.0,"Not true to size, made in China.  I find that most garments made in China is not true to size for the average Plus Size American woman.😬"
1.0,"Broken out of box. No lights, won't take a charge. You'd think they'd test these things before letting them leave the factory.<br /><br />Edit: I returned the 1st and the 2nd one I got also failed to charge. I'd stay away from this brand."
1.0,No me gustaron nada los colores
1.0,What I received was not a sideways cross. I’m trying to find a way to return it before Christmas and get the correct one. It’s Dec 19th.
1.0,This dress is very wide and the fit is unusual- i returned it in February 17 and still have not rec’d a refund I am disappointed .
1.0,I was hoping to return these.  I bought as a gift however they are shaped weird and do not fit.  They are very wide so they fall off.
1.0,They were smaller than advertised
1.0,it get broken
1.0,Way to small for an extra large more likely a medium or a slim fit large.  Dissapointed
1.0,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED DONT LOOK NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. THEIR LIKE METAL WITH PINK SPRAY PAINT. VERY DISAPPOINTED
1.0,Change color on my skin within an hour
1.0,Worst thing in the world ! I’m so afraid I just let Covid 19 into my home ! Masks are not individually wrapped. Plus my bags were torn open too ! Today is a scary day for me as I use oxygen. ZERO STAR FROM ME ! I want a full refund of my money with interest too !!!
1.0,They are very see-through. Not what I was expecting. I will be returning this item.
1.0,IT IS NOT MARKED ANYWHERE ON NECKLACE 925 ONLY AN ADDED CIRCLE.
1.0,Til the Snap fell off<br /> Was not real reliable to hold the phone up for any length of time.
1.0,"not even worth sending it back, I don't have a printer, I would have to go to the post office and send it out myself and be reimbursed up to a certain about, or have UPS come with a pre-printed label that I would have to pay 1.00 for. Since I am disabled and unable to drive or walk to the post office I have no option but to keep the item and use as a dust rag. I also ordered the size that another woman who weighed the same as myself purchased and was happy with the fit. So its not as if I ordered the wrong size."
1.0,"Ordered a size I knew would be too big and was disappointed, very sung fit, sizes run two sizes small, sleeves too short. It looks good but will return as does not fit at all"
1.0,"We ordered this dress for a family member's First Holy Communion service.  I do not recommend purchasing this dress, we were extremely disappointed with this purchase. The workmanship is HORRIBLE!  The dress was sewn incorrectly and we had to pay shipping if we wanted to return it! The cost to return is almost as much as the purchase price!"
1.0,Made sooo cheap the first one came broken in the box so they replaced it with sending me another one! But that one literally jus broke into pieces when i just picked up my cat carrier!! I didn’t hit it I literally tapped the top of the carrier to pick it up and the bracelet broke into 4 pieces smh NOT HAPPY With the quality of the bracelet at all
1.0,After only a week of use it got badly stained by being in my jean pocket. Looks totally different and can't even use it anymore
1.0,glasses do not sit right on face
1.0,This shirt reeked of formaldehyde and even after thorough washing with  lots of laundry detergent it still reeks and stunk up the rest of the wash it was with.  Its just awful!
1.0,Shirt was thin as tissue paper
1.0,It’s not pink. Doesn’t look nice at all. Not using it.
1.0,"I don't know exactly where this is made, but they must use very tiny tiny models. I'm normally somewhere between a size 6 and 8, i got a large and it hardly fit my waist let alone cover my bum. Not worth it."
1.0,Beautiful! But...it wouldn't attach to my watch.... so sad...
1.0,"I was disappointed with this dress. I'm 5'10, but of average build, so I usually buy a size medium. I picked the color green, because it looked like a nice forest green. First impression: The green was too bright, being more of a jewel-tone than pictured. This wasn't too big of a deal, but it got worse. The material is thick, but appears cheap. Being a tall lady, the &#34;high&#34; part of the high-low hemline was much too short, barely covering anything important at all. It didn't stretch fully over my shoulders, causing the sleeves to draw up over my arms and making the dress appear to have more of a boat-neck neckline. It wasn't too tight, but the darts were in the wrong place. Overall, this dress is not a pretty color, and just wasn't designed with tall people in mind.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Might look alright if you're closer to 5'5<br />-Zipper works and sewing construction seems good<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Colors falsely advertised<br />-Poorly proportioned for tall people"
1.0,very disappointed...didn't fit my ear
1.0,Had to return. It didn’t fit right. Very large. Maybe should of got smaller size
1.0,"First product I’ve had to return to amazon. It was the cheap China fabric that is completely see through and worst material ever. It would have been the perfect dress if it was not see through and better quality. I get it’s only 20$, but this wasn’t worth a dollar."
1.0,Disappointing. Not the right color. Didn't fit. Way to expensive Ti return or exchange. Into the rag bag.
1.0,Order for my FIL Need to order one size up
1.0,I put it on my ankle as soon as I received it. Within an hour it broke due to snagging in the carpet when I kneeled down to change my grandsons diaper.
1.0,Already broken!!!!
1.0,Cheap poorly made quality. Screw part strips out easily and then it becomes impossible to remove. Save your money and look for a better product. I have purchased 3 sets in different designs and they all ended up the same. Poor workmanship. Not worth the price
1.0,I have worn it once. I was not a fan. It did not fit as expected and has discouraged me from trusting Amazon with clothing purchases.
1.0,Was very small and looked like cheap child's jewelry.  I sent it back
1.0,"Out of the 12 pieces in the box, only 5 of them worked. Emails to the seller have gone unanswered. While the price is low, it's not low enough if you get less than 1/2 of them working.  If you order this set, be prepared for many of them to arrive defective."
1.0,I was super excited to find these socks but when they came I discovered I had 2 socks that both read BRING ME SOME  WINE. I’m disappointed and will just have to buy the correct socks somewhere else
1.0,"It's small! It will fit a child. Does not fit like the photo. Won't go under the chin...<br />I like that I can feel the copper layer, so I know it's there & will last."
1.0,Terrible quality. Probably from a sweat shop in China. The label is in Chinese even.. do not buy this. Waste of money
1.0,I'm sure everyone has that dollar store where everything is a dollar. Here it's called dollar tree. Sometimes you can find cool stuff there. If I found this hat there I would not have paid one dollar for it. It would have probably broken on the way to the checkout if for some reason I thought I needed it after seeing it in person. You might be able to cut it up and repurpose it for craft supplies. But it's definitely not a Halloween witch hat lol
1.0,this runs really small and is a polyster feel that has no flow and is not a wrap around as it appears. I returned immediately.
1.0,"The gold coating wore off after about a month.  If you want a silver-colored band, get this and wear it for a month or so.  Otherwise, pass."
1.0,Product is poor quality compared to picture. Buyer beware.
1.0,These are junky material. See through and not stretchy
1.0,Disappointed! Not well made at all the rivets that hold the straps are cheap.  The leather is thin and wrinkled nothing like what is pictured. I used the bag for two weeks and the leather around the rivets is stretched and all the exposed edges around the zippers are unraveling.
1.0,It is very cute is a bit large sizes are not consistent hung up in closet just now putting it on for a wedding and found that the armpit has a hole in it so I guess I won’t be using it. Cheap material.
1.0,Not to happy with this shirt. I ordered two shirts and my Pantera shirt came all jacked up. It's so blurred and crooked. I don't understand why it wasn't inspected before shipping. Cool thing is they refunded me order. And responded fast. My Judas priest shirt was perfect in size and clear. It's all good. I'm happy with these guys. Hopefully they will inspect product before shipping out to customer.
1.0,Fit like a tent !! Large was at least 3xx !!! Washed it before I wore it and four buttons came off !!! Horrible shirt !!
1.0,these things fell apart within a couple weeks. Had to throw them out. Look for other options.
1.0,This was a week late and poor quality.
1.0,"More like 20mm - too narrow for the Samsung Gear S3. Arrived without any spring bars, and the Gear S3 spring bars won't fit inside the band."
1.0,It’s more see through than expected and did not fit
1.0,"I wanted socks that come to my knees or atleast the calf and nope, I had to give them away."
1.0,"This was tooo small.  I order xl and it fitted like a medium.  My dress size is 14.  When I took it out the pack, it look small."
1.0,I thought for the price this would be perfect but one sleeve was loose fitting and the other was tight! It was as if there was a small sleeve and medium sleeve. Either would have been fine had they been the same.
1.0,"Top has holes, not even on both side.  Someone took a hole puncher, like you use with paper, and the top has holes.  I""d send it back but its easier to keep without going through all the<br /><br />Top came with holes on both sides, like a hole puncher was used on it,  I'd send it back but its to keep."
1.0,Can't get the watch to turn on at all
1.0,very cheaply made broke as soon as I took it out of the box and chains are noticeably different quality. would not recommend.
1.0,"I ordered an extra large and it looks like a small...also, the suit was ripped when I took it out of the bag."
1.0,"They look good but are extremely fragile, don’t recommend. They lasted me 2 days"
1.0,This is the SECOND time I ordered this keychain. The first one came in and was missing the “L” in laughter. My second one came in today and has the same problem!!!
1.0,Just received and one shoe will not charge! My son has not even work them yet.
1.0,The only reason I gave one star is because you have to give at least one . The design of the dress is beautiful. It’s the slip underneath that doesn’t cover your butt . It would only cover mid way of my butt . I was very disappointed because the dress itself is beautiful.
1.0,these are NOTHING like the picture at all. The two I received in white and grey fit like slightly over sized shirts. They aren’t off the shoulder. The quality is decent. Very disappointed
1.0,Worst sets of earrings ever!!<br /> Don't bother buying them.. Waste of money. 2 pairs broke as I was trying to snap the clasp....
1.0,bad quallity
1.0,"Would not give one out of five if I could give lower.<br />Poorly made, long wait, would never purchase again."
1.0,The fit is cheap and unfortunately did not fit correctly at all. I am looking to return it:(
1.0,runs small.  The lace is hard. Returned
1.0,Received product and the pearls weren’t attached to the earring. They are just loose in the package.
1.0,"The straps are not attached. Was only given 1 lonely button to sew on myself, not 4 buttons, but 1! Even tho it’s high waisted... the straps aren’t even long enough to reach from back to front if they were attached. Super disappointed"
1.0,Bought this for my son. He wore it swimming and it crapped out and no longer works.<br />Buyer beware. YMMV.
1.0,Not worth it even at this low price.
1.0,Had to return the outfit. It was too big and the material seemed cheap. Not a fan at all.
1.0,Don’t waste your money. The bar is super long and not comfortable. I took the bottom off and put it on an old belly ring. Go with something else
1.0,"These are not Kate Spade earrings. They are cheap looking with missing stones, and the brand definitely is NOT Kate Spade."
1.0,"I had to return and order 2 sizes smaller than my son’s shoe size. And even then, it’s definitely made for a wider foot too so if your son has normal or narrow feet, these are not the shoes for you!"
1.0,"Product is too small, but did not receive receipt with shipping box to return."
1.0,Don't buy might get a rusty earring or both.
1.0,Not enough padding. And wrist wrap is rough and uncomfortable.
1.0,This product is awful. It's huge on top... tiny at the waist then flared at the bottom. You can't pass it over your shoulders neither your hips. Poor quality material and zipper. Can't do anything with it but to toss it. Wish I could rate it zero...
1.0,Just don't buy it. The metal is not silver and turns copper colored in 2 months.
1.0,I ordered my usual size and it was physically impossible to get my foot inside the shoe. Missed the return deadline so ended up selling them.
1.0,Broke when we took it out of box
1.0,These are cheap and the plastic is hard to see through.
1.0,"When I first got these I loved them. They look great, stay tight & all seemed well. I had to actually come back here and changed my review because I'm so disappointed in the fact that 2 of these pairs had completely rusted where the thread is within 2 months of wearing. During the 10+ years I've been wearing plugs (of practically every material) I have never had this problem, especially with the measures I take to maintain the cleanliness and condition of my ears as well as jewelry. Definitely a rough disappointment"
1.0,No way these could be worn in ears.
1.0,the construction is poor it's price!
1.0,Poor quality. The charm fell off after a day
1.0,Button fell off after second washing. Material is very thin. Don't expect them to last very long.
1.0,Doesn’t look real at all. Don’t waste your money get the real one. It’s way too big and some of the pieces slip off. The magnetic one is uncomfortable and hurts to wear when u get it in the right place u can wear it for a few minutes but then starts to hurt again.
1.0,"This product is not at all as it was pictured and is misrepresented. It’s a cheap toy glove that is squished, the wrong colors all together, and a huge knock of. Do not purchase. I will be demanding my money back."
1.0,Break to Easley
1.0,I didn't know what to do with these dopey things. I guess I bought this because it had good reviews.
1.0,Way too tight and short in the crotch and I am not a large person by anyones measurements.
1.0,It holds up my drawers
1.0,The clasp is cheaply made. It came undone randomly and my watch fell to the hard ground. Don’t buy this.
1.0,Cheap material & runs very small
1.0,Don’t buy. Don’t work. Very cheezy
1.0,Didn't like it fiber was so bad very disappointed 😡
1.0,"This is not a sweatshirt... it’s thinner than t shirt material. It’s also not tie dye at all, but rather a very hideous paint splotchy pattern. Looks very cheap. This is not something Amazon should be carrying. Looks like something you would receive when you order from Wish."
1.0,Regardless of fit. These are not the sneakers displayed on the first and last image! They are the aqua and pink ones shown in the middle of the images. ‘Very disappointing!
1.0,"The watch is not water resistant to 200m as is advertised on it's dial. I took a shower with it shortly after receiving it in the mail. I immediately noticed condensation under the crystal. Not a bad product for only $4.40, just don't get it wet. Mine is going into the garbage. A very inexpensive lesson learned about the quality of LANDFOX watches."
1.0,"After using this band just one week, the magnet came out. I carefully put it back in place but that didn’t last long. Poor quality. Don’t recommend."
1.0,This is nothing more than a thin spandex material long sleeved shirt! It says right in the name of the item that it is a hooded SWEATSHIRT for boys! I assure you it is definitely not a sweatshirt it’s a thin thin shirt!
1.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. Dont buy this horrible necklace. It's not worth it"
1.0,This is just a regular cheap cloth mask. This is NOT a mask for singing.
1.0,The product (boys underwear) is fine but the item description clearly stated 9-pack and it was actually a 3-pack.
1.0,I bought this for my son to wear on Halloween. He’s 9yo and he usually Large. I got XL so that he’s comfortable and he can use it after Halloween. First of all the material has no stretch. The top runs small and the bottoms are true to size. I still felt like it was good enough to wear until IT RIPPED! My son was just jumping and posing as Goku (as kids do) he was not being too rough at all but it split in between his legs. We are so disappointed bc he won’t be able to wear it out
1.0,Not flattering.<br />Fits weird in my<br />Opinion.<br />Won’t wear.
1.0,"shoes started to ""crumble"" pretty quick with pieces falling off it"
1.0,Strap broke after one wear! Cheap. Do not purchase
1.0,I am unhappy....want my money back ... the product does not look like ... it appears to be small but in good quality...<br />what I received is cheap and does not look as nice as this picture
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this and wear it for my birthday. But sadly it does not provide any type of support. I looked pregnant. I ended up wearing my Anne Cherry Waist Trainer instead, which gave me that cinched waist. I really wanted to like this because all of the amazing reviews. But will not buy again."
1.0,it's not even real wood!!!
1.0,Cheap looking. Wore it twice and it turned bronze
1.0,Wore this shirt out once and it feels like a book cover material. Has snags already in the shirt. When I put it on for the first time it has loose strings in the chest area. More of a red color and not maroon.
1.0,First off I measured my hand like they said and they are to small. While I can wear them they are really hard to take off. Also the padding is not very good as I have smashed it down after having them only a couple of weeks
1.0,Got this for my son as a stocking stuffer and the logo is printed upside down. Can't take it away from him long enough to send it back for a replacement.
1.0,"This product comes from China, so you can't be confident that the engraving you specify is the actual engraving you'll get. The house number for my address is 6111, which I specified as part of the engraving; but when I received the item, it read 6AAA. What a disappointment."
1.0,"Very pretty but fits horrible, way to big for a women’s face, has to be modified."
1.0,I tried the glasses with high hopes.  All the glasses did is make everything yellow which cut the light on everything.  The star bursts from the lights were still there.
1.0,"When I order a hoodie, I expect it to be nice and thick material. This is a very poor quality specially the material. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my son but I was really disappointed with it. Also was way too big for the size I ordered."
1.0,Cheaply made and very poor fit.
1.0,"Did not like these, the material was weird and completely see-through. Returned right away."
1.0,One of the snaps on the belt was broken when delivered. So much for “high quality”.
1.0,"So not only does the shoelace not look like that, at all, it was literally A shoelace. ONE! What am I supposed to do with one? This is very misleading LP"
1.0,Not like the picture poor made dress
1.0,Didn’t fit properly
1.0,Cheaply made and does not fit like the picture. It is really short and I can barely fit my hands in the small opening for the pockets.
1.0,Not anywhere near the same mask as pictured. 10/10 would not wear or buy again.
1.0,They were broking
1.0,too small and child cant breathe.<br />went to return item and they charge half the cost of the item to return it. unbelievable!
1.0,"The fabric is a bad quality, look like a Halloween costume"
1.0,"I did not like this dress at all, the elastic band at the top has no elasticity and doesn't hold. I use it for sleeping"
1.0,This product should have been returned
1.0,Very small and skimpy. My normal size is 18. Asked for xl for extra room. Very disappointed.I am returning this item
1.0,"The pictures make it appear to be a Hoodie sweatshirt, its not.<br />It is very thin material, I am not pleased with this at all."
1.0,Vino una rota
1.0,So disappointed. I bought this as a gift for my friend and it arrived broken!! Unacceptable. Returning this asap!
1.0,Student books too heavy for this
1.0,"The frayed part fell apart after second wash. Left a huge hole. Otherwise, I loved the fit. Flattering and cute, but Will not purchase again."
1.0,They look nice but they are way too dark to see out of
1.0,Getting the button threw the hole was a major job the hole was smaller then the button and the metal button looks real cheap like it might not last. they  are ok in the legs but the waist is a bit large and seems like they ride low.
1.0,Top portion of dress was not proportionate to rest of dress- bra cups up too high and too close together- they were sewn inside so couldn’t adjusted them.  Got refund but they requested I send it back & provided mailing label.  UPS cost to send back dress was $133.00.  Total refund I received was $123.00 which was the cost of the dress and $39.99 shipping fee that I paid upon purchase.<br />I’m NOT returning it and they better NOT charge me for it !<br />The dress is garbage!!
1.0,"Not happy at all. The dress was missing the tag and although I ordered a large, it looked like a small size. I was going to return it but ended up given it to a friend. I do have to say that it was a beautiful dress."
1.0,One of the gloves fingers does not separate.. kinda like a mitten .
1.0,Very cheaply made. Do your research I bought a better quality one for half the price. Very disappointed!
1.0,I bought these and can’t even get the balls off to put in my ears I have used pliers everything the balls will not come off
1.0,I returned this item because it came with a locked zipper and no key.
1.0,3 pairs weren’t wearable as the metal has not but cut properly and is way too thick.
1.0,Cheaply made and not accurate
1.0,Way bigger and really goddy looks like something you'd get at a fair :-/ not what I expected
1.0,Too goddy so i returned them.  :(
1.0,"If it had arrived in working condition, I might have a better review, but the clasp holding the locket together, was broken, so the product is garbage. Not impressed whatsoever, giant waste of money."
1.0,"Too big, too gaudy. The latch does not work properly."
1.0,so not size accurate.
1.0,Just. Bad
1.0,Runs small. Not for the thick of bishes
1.0,I bought an XL and it fit like a medium.  Everything else I buy in Large or Extra Large fits perfect but this one runs really small. :(
1.0,"These weren't what I wanted at all. I was so bummed. No tummy support, no shape, no nothing. The material is silky but it's stretchy & doesn't go back. Just hangs all blah. Looks like granny panties for real. So sad. I threw them all in the trash. Boo."
1.0,Not pretty at all and broke shortly after I got it.
1.0,"Bought this pants and received absolutely different. Nor color, nor style is close to the image what is advertised. And fabric isn't cotton, it's half synthetic. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY"
1.0,They come out very easy
1.0,see through. Poor quality
1.0,Its bad quality and is a woman's jacket although i bought it labeled as men's.<br />The fit is totally unflatering to any body shape and it looks cheap.<br />It is comfy though.<br /><br />So if you're a blind woman I'd say go for it.
1.0,"Dress is cute but the picture was for below the knee, that is why I bought it and it was probably about 5 inches above the knee.  I am a little on the tall side but my teenager isn't and it barely came to her knees.  Just too short."
1.0,Cute shirt but WAY TOO ITCHY! Wish I would have just returned them
1.0,"This dress is cute, quality is what you’d expect for the price. But this dress has a completely sheer lining under the lace! So be aware of that"
1.0,Looks brassy and I'm sorry i bought
1.0,"When I bought this, I was wanting to cover up my stomach but the slightest amount of wind and it flies up showing your stomach. Then in the water, it also won't stay down. Not very comforting if you're insecure about yourself being chunky."
1.0,This thing is the size of penny. Would you spend $3 + $3 shipping on a penny?
1.0,This is nothing like what it shows in the photo. Different chain and different pendant. Very disappointed!
1.0,i didn't get to ut it on . it broke trying to put it on.. smh
1.0,"I wear women's size 10, I ordered 10.5-11 a size bigger. Couldn't get them on. Horrible sizing"
1.0,Returned it the same day it came; size chart is waaayyy off.
1.0,Cheaply made and strings were hanging from seams
1.0,"I love the beads not the string. I purchased two bracelets in March 2016, a month ago and while adjusting the size the string broke.<br />The string within the bracelet beads broke. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,This necklace was broken when i recived it
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Sometimes you need to stick with what you know.
1.0,Decepcionada....mala calidad
1.0,I thought that they looked super cute and fit my right size. Then I went to go put them on and they seems sticky. once I had them on for about a minute they started to unstick. I got the tan and the black one. I even tried wearing them super lose and they still just fell off because it was not sticky enough. These were a complete waist of my time and money.
1.0,"This company seriously took a photo from another website, used cheap labor to COPY the shirt, and then sold it as their own.  The shirt is entirely different in look and fit.  The sleeves, for one, are POOFY.  As in Seinfeld's puffy shirt episode.  And if you don't recognize that reference, imagine some British fop from the 1700's.  Or a pirate.  Yeah, you're getting the image.  Big thick elastic at the wrists that definitely don't shove up your arms like in the photo.  And the neckline is entirely different.  Instead of a low cut henley, you get a crew neck/boat neck cut with the buttons around your collarbone.  I highly recommend you don't buy this."
1.0,This smelled funny and was smaller than I thought. It was also not made very well.
1.0,Waaaay to small. Not true to size at all!
1.0,all broke in a week
1.0,Shrinks so bad. What a waste
1.0,Fit was fine. I'm 5'7 130lbs. These are advertised as cotton but they are 92% polyester and 8% spandex. They remind me of the Leggings Depot ones but they're not as soft. I'm returning because they're super super thin and they smell moldy/ mildewy and they are not cotton as advertised
1.0,this was extremely tiny.
1.0,I tthought that the purse was going to be a perfect gift for my fiances birthday but the color of the purse you see online was clearly of a different color not satisfied at all with the co!or she recieved. I will never order from this company again. It totally failed my attempt to make her happy on her one special day.
1.0,I am usually a medium and ordered an xxl and it was too small. But the bigger issue is that it was not even REMOTELY as pictured. I mostly ordered it for the big bow belt and instead my dress came with a super skinny piece of fabric that doesn't even remotely compare to the wide belt pictured in the item listing. Don't bother with this.
1.0,very small for XL.
1.0,I thought the description said it made sounds and lit up. It only lights up.  Also was described as the fingers move to make a fist. It is very stiff and no way will it make a fist. I wasn’t very pleased.
1.0,I bought this product for my son and the chain changed colors within 2 weeks and it wasn’t even being used which was very disappointing.
1.0,I wish it would have came.  I loved the color and was told it was comfortable.  The 😪
1.0,Way to short. And I'm 5'5''
1.0,Don’t buy when I brought they lost it waste of money
1.0,"Wore it one day and the whole stone part broke off. I don't have a physically taxing job, so there's nothing I would have done to bump and break it.<br />It WAS pretty for the few hours I got to wear it..."
1.0,These slippers are stated as toddler shoes they were received as a woman’s size 9 and were huge that’s why they were returned they are not toddler shoes
1.0,Quality very bad<br />Customer service is -1 star<br />I'm waiting 3 weeks for a answer for returning items and until now no any action<br />Don't buy any cheap item<br />:(
1.0,Horrible!!!!!
1.0,"No matter how much you try, bending, opening up or even polishing: this ring is pretty much unwearable. It cuts in on every open edge! Pinches painfully too. Sigh."
1.0,"The photo and description of the item is misleading.  It shows and states ""Kids&Adult banana costume： There is a child banana costume and adult banana costume, you can wear it with your kids together!"" leading one to believe you will receive both.  However only one child size costume was sent."
1.0,It was super small returning ASAP
1.0,This is cheaply made and is not a winter hat I am very disappointed with this
1.0,"it&#34;s too small and the material is too sorft, feels like it would tear easily"
1.0,Unusable and unreturnable since I bent it trying to get it open to place charms on it. I wouldn't recommend the item.
1.0,Used probably 5 times!
1.0,See through and wag too small

1.0,"I was very excited about this shacket and to wear it to an upcoming concert! I received it today and when I tried it on it was very, very itchy. It had a gross musty smell to it and it the dropped shoulders were so unflattering. I immediately hit the return button. Definitely not worth $40."
1.0,"I'm 6'-2&#34; 224lbs and these XXL fit as if they were painted on me, and short to boot... although the quality is very good, so if your a small medium they would fit quit well."
1.0,not silver
1.0,"Brim was attached to the hat crooked.  Poor workmanship.  Cheap, faded logo just stenciled on the hat.  Returned."
1.0,I think the title is wrong. It’s not cashmere at all.
1.0,Returned it. Very cheap made. For the price i just buy a plastic poncho
1.0,If you read all the reviews about dots on legs then believe it!
1.0,kept slipping off of the Alta. Had to return. Customer service was great though.
1.0,The metal is not attached to the leather. Missing screws. Needed to be returned twice because of same issues
1.0,I don't care for the clasp on these earrings.  You could easily lose one without realizing it.
1.0,Lens popped out first day I had them; very challenging to pop back in. Kept falling out. Don’t buy.

1.0,"Bummer they were all tarnished when received. Unusable. Cool charms, but also most were much thinner than expected, some were heftier charms, but tarnished. :("

1.0,Not good<br />company logo on  left sore spots on my feet
1.0,Arrived way late.<br />When I opened them they had holes in them straight out of the packaging...DO NOT BUY!
1.0,I purchased these pajamas for Christmas this year. I followed the instructions and washed them before wearing. Everything I touched and everywhere I sat was covered in bright red lint from these pajamas especially my sheets. I threw them out on the 26th.
1.0,When we got this and pulled it out of the bag it is made for a toddler not a women or a child so I will not purchase this again<br />Thank you
1.0,I like the style but the size was smaller than expected. I gave it away
1.0,The plastic is not as shown in the picture. It fits wrong. Its not the correct size for the cap. Its bad quality.<br />The cap nice but I wanted a special protection for the face. Not worth buying it.
1.0,Broke the first day I used it at work
1.0,Why call it a straw hat when it is made from 100% paper? Waste of money.
1.0,"The arms of the nose pads were identical on both sides (instead of flipped opposites) making it impossible to wear because they can't be adjusted properly. I was very excited for these glasses as they are super cute, but will be returning as they're terribly crooked and cannot be adjusted."
1.0,It runs extremely small-- be aware the sizing is ridiculously small😣😣<br />I cannot use it.😤 I had to give it away
1.0,"The title of this changed after I ordered it. &#34;HSRKB Men's Belted Cargo Short, Cropped Pants, Long Shorts for Men (A083-Blue Camo, 40)&#34; is the title from my orders entry. Clearly marked as &#34;belted&#34;. If you click the link now the title is:<br /><br />&#34;HSRKB Men's Cargo Short, Cropped Pants, Long Shorts for Men Without Belt&#34;<br /><br />That's great. This is not the first time trying to buy shorts like this where the belt is pictured or mentioned but there is no belt. Scam? Or just bad quality control?<br /><br />Quality of the material is not great, pretty thin. There are better quality products from other vendors, at the same price."
1.0,This is that stretchy nylon type of material. Very disappointing. Will return.
1.0,"Necklace seems to be fine, but bend your wrist wrong and bracelet breaks at the clasp very unsatisfied with the way its put together"
1.0,"Even though I ordered a different style from the same manufacturer, these fit extremely small on me."
1.0,They came apart in a short time
1.0,"With no provocation, a pair broke in the middle after just a week of very light use. Not worth it at any price."
1.0,Broke within two days.  Stay away
1.0,Unfortunately the bracelet broke within the month.
1.0,They didn’t fit the way the picture made them look. Uncomfortable and odd
1.0,"These are VERY tiny. Perfect for an infant's first piercing, even the posts are too small for an older child's ears."
1.0,Nothing like the the picture
1.0,IF I COULD GIVE -0 STAR I WOULD THIS PRODUCT WAS SEWN TOGETHER LIKE A BLIND PERSON DID IT AND I TRIED TO GET MY MONEY BACK WITH NO LUCK
1.0,This product deserves zero stars. Poorly and cheaply made. Would not recommend
1.0,"Worn maybe 4-5 times and enveloped a hole and then after a day of being on them they ripped up completely.  Comfortable, but unless your hardly on your feet these socks are a rip off.  Already thrown 2/5 pairs in the trash and barely had them 2 months."
1.0,It was broken the day i wore it.
1.0,Was excited to try this on and extremely let down. Picture of it online is way off from what it actually looks like. This looks like a dress I would have worn when I was pregnant or as a child lol. Too much fabric on the bottom elastic is too high.<br /><br />Do not buy.
1.0,Magnet doesn’t stay.
1.0,I had cancelled this order after not showing up. It arrived yesterday - 5 days after I cancelled it. I ordered XL which is up a size for me but it looks like a small arrived. The moldy smell was so bad it is sitting in my garage. I would never recommend a product like this.
1.0,The fabric is chamois material! Very strange. Fabric not as described. Returning.
1.0,It fits alright but it was cracked when I took it out of the package. The watch works though. :(
1.0,"As bathing suits go I’m usually between a medium and a large meaning a medium is too small and a large is too big but this suit is smaller than any medium I’ve purchased. Even if the top fit around properly, my boobs would still be hanging out. The coverage would not be like the pictures portrayed."
1.0,Took almost 4 weeks to arrive and very poor quality. I asked for a return/refund and they refused saying it was too expensive to return and refunded me $4.90 the item was $26 dollars!! WTF
1.0,Well their very pretty. But it size 6x but it isn't so they don't fit. Second time I have ordered some and they don't fit. The size 6x is not 6x it fits my Aunt who is 5ft4 and weighs 120lbs.
1.0,"I had to return item did not fit, also very thin see through"
1.0,Not true to size.  Ordered a size 7 but it fits like a 6.  Very dissatisfied!  Now I have a beautiful ring that I can't wear.
1.0,Broke within a day. Not the band the piece on the band that allows it to attach to the watch.
1.0,"Very phoney and had paste on it, not something I would recommend"
1.0,silicone is bubbly once put on and the bubbles show through any clothing you would use these with. very disappointed. never wore them out to test bc it doesnt look right.
1.0,The sun changed color very quickly and the metal piece fell off. So bummed it’s after refund date. Had it for only 30 days.
1.0,This product came in and.was supposed.to.be a size 24 but it looks to me like it would be a 12 maybe. Very disappointed. Was going to wear to a formal event and now.I.have to start.the hint all over again......
1.0,"Bought the largest size available.<br />Was still way too small for anyone not super petite, or a middle schooler."
1.0,Cheap quality. You get what you pay for. The back is all open and poorly made. even though it was really cheap I wouldn't have spent my 3$ I'd I had seen it in person. Junk.
1.0,"Don’t buy, these are junk. Broken within days of normal wear. My son wasn’t even hard on them."
1.0,Way too big for my small head it doesn't fit well like it said waste of money
1.0,They're very slippery and tight.... every move I made they slid down.
1.0,"I wear a 29-30 pant and got a Large because it says fits true to size... I should've ordered a 2x/3x with how tiny these are. Super thin, no support. They are a waste of money"
1.0,"I paid over $10 extra to have this shipped to me ASAP. Once I opened the package, I found the keychain was SILVER. Not green, like it is advertised. On top of that, it is the cheapest keychain I have ever purchased. It caught on my sweater immediately because the cut is so jagged and sharp. You can see it in the photos. You can also tell how paper thin the metal is by the unevenly spaced wording on the back of the keychain. So cheap. Such a disappointment. Don’t purchase."
1.0,Runs way too small and short. Made very cheaply. Don't bother.
1.0,The material is flimsy. I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and was quite disappointed with the material. It is very flimsy and see through the lining is see through also. I will return this dress.
1.0,I've already have a couple of these break after just a week or 2 of use.
1.0,It's not what the picture looks like. Low quality and bright red. Very thin material
1.0,"Seems well made and I was super excited to get in installed on my standard, round sound hole Kanilea uke last night, only to find the clip is too tight to go onto the wood so much so that the hard plastic clip almost scratched up my beautiful Koa wood....so 2 stars for the great overall quality. -3 stars for not fitting on a tiny little soprano and almost damaging my instrument....seems the wood around the sound hole is thicker than the clip opening and the plastic is so very hard and thick, there it little hope it would bend open enough to function as it was intended. It will be going back....what a bummer."
1.0,Wont fit boots. Boots require at a minimum 72&#34; lace length per boot. 40&#34; laces are for dress shoes only. Also i know i missed a lace.. Cheers
1.0,"Picture suggests it is gold color, it was actually lemon yellow"
1.0,I did not like this stupid shoe. They are too small. I wasted my money
1.0,"I received this today only to open it and their broken. One doesn’t even have a little ball thing to latch on the other end! Also, I have a 16g in my nose now. These are to big. So not happy I was waiting for these for days to be disappointed."
1.0,Complete scam nothing like whet was advertised. Cheap spandex crap with an american flag on the back\
1.0,"These boots came squeezed in an envelope, not properly packaged. My daughter has been wearing them for less than seven days. The material on the toes of both boots is wearing off. These boots are garbage."
1.0,I ordered one size up and it was incredibly small and tight.
1.0,"Do not waist your time or money on this dress. It is the worst material ever and looks nothing like the picture when you have it on. It was suppose to be black and is not black, picture below of me wearing it over top a black shirt to show the difference in color."
1.0,"These are AWFUL. I repurchased these elastic ties and they are completely different than the ones I originally purchased! How can a seller do that? I literally hit &#34;buy again&#34;; not only are they all different colors than what I originally purchased, and as advertised, but they break as soon as you go to use them! The quality is terrible. I am so disappointed because they are also ineligible to be returned."
1.0,"Not powerful enough to work on large high-end automatic watches. I own a TAG Heuer Carrera 44mm Calibre 16 Day-Date Automatic Chronograph. Despite being a member of TSA Pre-Check, the mental midget working the security line at the airport made me take off my watch and put it through the x-ray machine. Now, thanks to that $7/hr genius tasked with keeping us safe at the airport, my $5000 watch is gaining 10 minutes an hr.<br /><br />Despite numerous attempts, this device did nothing to demagnetize my watch. I know how to use the device, so it is not user error. This is a very cheap Chinese made device. It doesn't even include instructions, though there are plenty of instructions to be found online.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product. It might do the trick with screwdrivers and may even work with some of the smaller, thin cased wrist watches. However, if you've got a real high-end timepiece this thing is worthless. What you need is one of the high powered demagnetizers. I've since returned this one and ordered one of the $70 machines offered on Prime . You get what you pay for folks!"
1.0,"Horrible, lost my Apple Watch because it slips and slides all over the place. Nothing like the Apple magnetic band,  tried to save a few bucks instead.  lost a few hundred"
1.0,"The zipper on the right pocket is broken. The seller should make sure that zippers work and work for a long time. This is my first time wearing this pair of pants. Otherwise, I like them and they fit as expected. If the zipper works I will give them 5 stars"
1.0,Horrible seller. The item is not true to size. I sent it back to them but I did not receive any refund from them.
1.0,I used this bag maybe 4 times n the zipper to the main part broke off!
1.0,Cheap looking so we returned
1.0,"The pattern is A LOT BIGGER than the pic, the top portion is WAY TOO SMALL on the breasts.  The rest of the dress is WAY TOO BIG.  Dress is defective.  Colors are very different compared to pic."
1.0,"Was really looking forward to this bundle, affordable and quality packaging. Unfortunately, after unwrapping everything and opening it up, I come to find the shoe cleaning fluid to be fairly light. Upon further inspection, it is then revealed that the bottle is actually completely empty and the bottom of the bottle is cracked in 3 different places. Pretty frustrating considering that the cleaner is aruguably the most important aspect, and I’ve now paid for a faulty product."
1.0,Be aware!!! This belt is not 100% leather. It has a leather core and some rubber coating on top. As soon as you touch it you know is not leather. Yes I know is cheap and you get what you pay for.
1.0,I work in a prison where you need to carry see through bags. In less than 3 weeks this bags seems were coming out causing me to drop things on the way in.
1.0,It looked great but way too small
1.0,"I'm sending this back.  There were ties missing so now way to connect the loops in back, just a shoulder tie.  Very weird suit 😳  I put fits as expected but really I couldn't tell without being able to properly close it.  The color is a very very bright orange."
1.0,"Does not look like it is in the picture, it's much smaller than it is in the photo. 😢 the zebra print one is just white with black stripes its not even really a print this is so disappointing"
1.0,This ring pealed off in days. It's not a 925 sterling silver ring. My finger was green in few days.
1.0,I was looking forward to these shoes but I had to return them. They are really UGLY!!!
1.0,cheap and no support. i threw them away
1.0,Returning! This mask came damaged. Save your money. It’s falling apart and the mask smashed in!  Awful product.
1.0,These were small and hard for me to put on
1.0,Hat expands after normal use. Good quality material but because of the elasticity issue these hats are not a good buy. I have bought one in every size and they all do the same thing. I have also tried to contact the seller and manufacturer but have had no success in resolving this issue. Buyer beware.
1.0,"I had ordered 2 and both broke within A few days.  The second broke and I lost pieces.  It’s a pretty design, but very cheaply made!"
1.0,I’ve been buying geox since my 7 year old can walk and these fell apart in so few wears!
1.0,No it didn't it's cheap looking and was delivered with missing stops don't waste your money
1.0,The color is off it’s too big and I’ve returned the outfit and still haven’t gotten my refund wont be ordering again!!!!
1.0,"Literally just got this and was trying it on and the one shoulder strap broke.  The stitches completely separated.  I emailed the seller, because I really like the suit and how it fits, but this is unacceptable.  Will update when I hear back from seller."
1.0,Faded after one wash. Not worth the price.
1.0,I couldn't wear it. Recieved broken.
1.0,Cheap plastic... fell apart first time and was all distorted.
1.0,Garbage. ZERO Stars. Not the product that is advertised. This is a scam. Buy the Real Crye Precison Cap instead.
1.0,"The photo of the t-shirt on the website showed the melting cube graphic with bright colors.  However, I was very disappointed when I received the shirt and the colors were dull and muted.  This is the third t shirt of this graphic I have ordered and this is the only shirt that has such dull color.  I would have never ordered it had I known how poor the color quality was going to be.  Buyer beware !"
1.0,"The first thing I noticed was the speed hooks don't hold the laces the 2nd thing was how comfortable  they were . Too bad , comfortable boot with cheap plastic speed hooks , I tried to open up the hooks with a flat screw driver but they are plastic and just break. Bought these to replace a pair of Rocky boots that I've worn for 6 winter seasons ( they have metal hooks) but they have cheapened them I guess. Disappointed."
1.0,"The quality of the printing is the worse, washed one time prior to use and the drawings got cracked due to the quality of the 'printing'"
1.0,It is sadly not well built.
1.0,Silk material very very thin unflattering not giving at all
1.0,"Estaba tan contenta con el vestido  porque a simple vista todo era perfecto ,hasta que lo use anoche ,que decepción la tela esta rasgada por todas las costuras,la tela se va deshaciendo . No gasten su dinero en este vestido."
1.0,Too short and I’m only 5’3
1.0,Watch was missing parts - would not charge  Will return.  Very disappointed as this was a birthday gift.
1.0,This thing comes in a million pieces you have to assemble yourself. Everything falls apart and on the floor and nothing fits. It’s like a crappy toy that never would have been here in the U S. Big waste of money. Totally unusable.
1.0,I purchased this wallet whn i received and open it was damaged.
1.0,The dress is extremely long and way too wide at the hips besides bump out as if like there’s pockets or something but there’s not not good quality at all
1.0,Waaaaaay too big.  I always read the reviews before I order anything online. I'm large chested so I have to double check the sizes.  This time the reviews were way off.  Didn't like the fabric or the way it hung.  These are suppose to be Loose Fit Flared dresses not TENTS for Omar.
1.0,"I purchased two pair of these slippers. One of the  pair’s broke the very same day I received it, a waste of money. The second pair will be returned."
1.0,"Once again tricked out of money on something that doesnt even fit (like its shown in picture) This is insane if I could go back and rethink this I totally wouldnt buy them. They are small kids, definatly not for teens/adults. Dont waste the time of money or even consideration!"
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this product.  It was not an in expensive purchase, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the product wouldn't reccomend it."
1.0,I didn't like the ribbon lace it looked cheap and it was not a large more like a small
1.0,Most are broken due to poor quality and they come undone to easy
1.0,"They were very tight for being the largest size. The sequins in between the leg portion kept falling off I didn’t even end up wearing them out. They also don’t stretch, so if you find yourself with a little more junk in your trunk these pants are not for you."
1.0,"This item is too short.  It is made of great material, but is useless because you can't fit it over your face."
1.0,This watch does not work. It loses 5 to 10 minutes a week. This is the first time I've ever bought a watch that could not keep time. Do not buy this watch.
1.0,The reason for my low rating on the braclet is beacuse the crystals/rhinestones are only in the front center and its so expensive for the braclet not to have fully circulating crystals. Inwas really disappointed. Its for my wedding and it wasnt what I expected. Shipping was slow took over 3 weeks for it to arrive. I honestly would have gave this a max rating if it would have the rhinestones all the way around not just in the middle front place. On the picture you can see the front part thats the only one with rhinestones and the sides DO NOT have rhinestones its pure meta! Thanks
1.0,Quality isn't good enough for work out. Ripped at the first use
1.0,Need bigger sizes
1.0,"It is an ok coat, would not buy again."
1.0,I ordered extra large and I wear between a medium and a large and it was still too small. So I put it back and it's bad that I'm going to be sending it back. I just ended up throwing it away. It was a piece of garbage... Be careful what you order from here.
1.0,"I bought the medium blue/white combo in October 2017 after buying the brown/khaki combo in June 2017. I love this style of belt and was very happy when I received it.  I didn’t notice the problems beginning with the first two belts before I ordered the second pair. Why didn’t I wait?<br />Two huge problems:<br />1.  The buckle does peel as others said<br />2.  This thing has stretched so much I almost have enough material for two belts.<br /><br />The only thing I can try to do is cut off a good part of the belt, take off the end piece and try to sew it back on to the remaining belt. There is no stretch left so I know I can make it tight, It’s just a matter of whether I want to make the effort. Even if I am successful making this change, they will only be good as my really old jeans and shirts in which I paint rooms are - because who cares about them then?<br /><br />Oh, problems 3 and 4: the belts are no longer straight but kind of weave slightly back and forth from midline (I could live with that) and they are starting to have a smell like (now I know I’m making up a phrase that makes no sense but ...) dead rubber. I kid you not – one particular day I kept getting this slight wiff of something where ever I went and it became obvious that it had to be something on me. I kept smelling my clothes and there was nothing, my jacket nothing. When I finally got home and took the pants off I got the wiff again and smelled the belt!<br />I couldn’t believe it. I don’t know if it rained and that did it or what but that was the end of that.  What a ‘waist’ of 50 bucks!!<br /><br />So I guess I can paint, but no one will want to be near me."
1.0,Poor quality and doesn’t look good
1.0,Looks different in picture. Only one button.
1.0,It may be adjustable but it will only fit a person with a head the size of Frankenstein.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,Way too small even an extra large
1.0,"Just weird. First, the crop top was tight. I could wear it, but not comfortably. The pants.... oh my goodness, the pants. Just awful. They weren't sweats, they were just super long and didn't ""stack"" no matter what. I had to pull them up practically to my boobs just to not get that saggy butt look (and I'm a girl WITH a butt so it's bad when pants don't fit mine!!) What you get is NOT what the picture shows."
1.0,really it was just what I expected. not at all disappointed.
1.0,"The picture doesn’t match the description, I got different colors than in the pictures which is what I went off of, they were vibrant colors.  The description was for dark colors.  I got dark colors and was disappointed and returned."
1.0,I had to return this because of the poor workmanship.  Do NOT recommend.
1.0,terrible material runs small and colors bleed.
1.0,Thus watch band fell apart twice the first day I tried to wear it. The pin is a tiny piece of metal that can easily bend during normal wear and as soon as it does your straps can no longer stay attached and your very exspensive watch will fall to the floor. Better just hope you are standing over something soft when it does.
1.0,The instructions are inscrutable. The buckle comes off completely when you open it to remove the belt.
1.0,"I wanted so much to love this. But after a few days, it turned color. Tried to polish.  Garbage now. Threw my money away."
1.0,I had to send this dress back because even though I ordered two dress sizes bigger than I normally wear it was too tight in the breast and too short since I'm 5'10&#34; tall.  SO THIS DRESS RUNS SMALL. Very beautiful dress but way too small.
1.0,I bought a kids xxs for my toddler since a kids xxs shirts are big on him. This shirt is so small it won't go over his head🤬
1.0,"The product is horrible And  small, made cheap . On top of it I had to pay $12.50 for shipping. The product cost me 25 dollars which made me only get 12.50 back. Apperantly is a 3rd party company..<br />Will not recommend to anyone"
1.0,Just stone was plastic very cheaply made and it broke on the second time I wore it
1.0,I purchased this dress after reading their description. This was false. It is NOT satin of any kind. It is cheap stretchy fabric. Looks nothing even close to the picture. They claimed their dress was the real deal and it turned out to be junk. Totally disappointed. I sent it back.
1.0,"So, the dress is comfortable and the right size, but since when is navy blue, royal blue or pink the same as purple?"
1.0,Waste of money. Really cheap material.
1.0,What a piece of garbage<br />Do not buy<br />Junk
1.0,BUYER BEWARE: Do research before buying. This item is no where near worth the 100's of dollars its marked up to. This is one of those &#34;on sale&#34; attempts to steal peoples money. This item can easily be purchased from the dollar store. The crystal is fake and the chain will wear down on use.
1.0,My son's socks were soaking wet within 15 minutes. I will be returning them.
1.0,Stitching came out hopefully they will refund or send me a new hat
1.0,These look cute in photos but are cheap.  The plastic one broke while I was putting it on.  Some of the clasps did not work.  I returned.
1.0,Material is very see through and the dress is just unflattering
1.0,Bought 2x fits like a shrunk xl
1.0,Was very unhappy with this. It was nothing like the picture. I guess it away to a grade school girl. Was perfect for her.
1.0,Watch did not work.
1.0,Looks good after a two months of use shoes start giving very bad smell
1.0,"Product is defective, left arm is way smaller than the right one. I want to return it and they want me to pay shipping for their bad product? Not right, wish I could give a 0 star."
1.0,Its not 3 tone!!!!
1.0,"I am 5'11&#34; and 165lbs. I ordered a medium, the product was way too big. I am sending it back. Also, the blue is VERY blue. I wanted something between a blue and a navy, which is what I thought I was getting from the picture. Too big. Too blew. It blew."
1.0,"I wish that the earring post were a bit longer and the backing a little wider. When I tried it o, it looked very pretty, although it was hard to wear it because the post is too short and the very small backing is hard to fit. I was able to put it in place anyway, but in about an hour, an earring fell because the earring is heavy for the short post and the small backing. It's fine if the earring were worn alone. Do you have a peridot stud with a longer post?"
1.0,"I was super excited to find this on sale! But after running just 10ks in it, it had chafed nearly all of the skin off my back, especially where the clasp was situated. I unfortunately had to send it back."
1.0,"Had a terrible allergic reaction to the metal. My ear was red, hot and swollen. So sad because they were super cute."
1.0,Poor quality and design. They came apart when I unfolded them to use at Sporting Event. Was never able to use them even one time. Will not purchase from this company ever again. Poor quality. P
1.0,This product was advertised as PRIME....took 1 1/2 weeks to get to me which was too late for my trip. AND it is so floppy with no shape and huge!  Very disappointing for a SIGGI hat.
1.0,I didn't even put it on. The strap buckle clip was not in place where it's supposed to be.
1.0,"I loved it that it arrived fast and there was good customer service but the first time I tried wearing it the strap broke off,  it was so disappointed because it fit perfectly it's just the strap that broke."
1.0,Poor Engineering.
1.0,Horrible. The waist would fit a kid.  Made in China !
1.0,I like nothing about
1.0,"The color of pink was way different it was like a bright cotton candy pink. The material was pretty see through, the length was awkward (I'm 5ft 1"") made my calves look chubby."
1.0,Too small and too bulky
1.0,Too expensive for the quality of material that was received
1.0,No protection.
1.0,I wore this once and it broke the same day I put it on. Not happy. Mary Gibbs
1.0,To short and too small
1.0,Sort of an odd fit. Tight in the bust but loose in the hips.
1.0,Product is not for baby. May fit a 2-3 yr old.
1.0,False advertising!! They are so cheap because they run small. They aren't true to actual size.  Then when you try to return them for a refund they tell you that you are wrong after you send them pictures measuring them. Terrible customer service!
1.0,One of the chains was already broken.
1.0,"This guitar strap is not as represented and shown.  The strap has one selling feature (besides being cheap): they claim it doesn't slide around.  Wrong.  The strap is very slippery.  I needed this specifically for a neck-heavy Hofner-style bass which persists on pointing to seven o'clock because strap manufacturers no longer have the sense to put velour or some other nonskid finish on the underside.  Evidently &#34;Music Pro&#34; (to do the gentlemen the courtesy of correcting their infantile spelling) understood this issue, as they advertised their product as &#34;will not slide,&#34; but they were insufficiently honest not to market a product that performed as represented.  The strap is very slippery.  Did I mention the strap is very slippery?<br /><br />Also, those answering the questions about the width of the strap should check their facts before posting opinions.  It's not 4&#34; (if you think about it, that's very wide).  The pictures on the listing (most visible on the ugly guy in the red shirt) show a wide strap, at least 2.5&#34;, if not 3&#34;.  In fact, it's a scant two inches wide, much narrower than shown in the photo.  It's a cheap and nasty strap, inadequate for its intended use, and entirely contrary to published representations.<br /><br />The &#34;pick pocket&#34; is actually nothing more than a little gap between rivets, and not at all as pictured on the listing.  That's how so many reviewers can say the pocket is both too tight and too loose.  Anything other than an oversized pick will just disappear between the rivets, but you have to stack two or three deep to keep them from falling out.<br /><br />All in all, I have to call deceptive trade practices on this one.  At least Amazon processed the return in a matter of seconds and paid the return postage."
1.0,"Got this in the mail in roughly ~10 days. Tried it on and pretty disappointed. The material of the triblend is not bad (very soft and comfy), but the fit was just so odd. It was tight around my shoulders and arms, but very wide around the chest and stomach. A standard J Crew t shirt would do a far better job than this.<br /><br />Had high hopes for this as $25 for a ""custom"" long sleeve is a great deal when compared to the typical prices charged of say $50+, but I am pretty disappointed and will be going for a refund."
1.0,Very poor quality don’t buy. The hat looked like a crappy do rag
1.0,"The stones fell out almost immediately.  One earring is missing 3, one is missing 2."
1.0,A mens 3XL would not fit my 8 year old grandson.  Only did a partial refund I ordered 5 of these and none of them fit anything.  I messaged with no response
1.0,Bought for adult dtr. Fit was to tight.
1.0,Cheaply made and fat.
1.0,"The top doesn't close/zipper. Since the beverages are on the bottom, everything on the top falls out when you try to open the cooler area."
1.0,"I just got mine today and I have to say I am disappointed because it looks so cheap and nothing like the pictures make it look, Hell had I went to Kohl's I could have gotten a Vera Wang Purse for same price or just few dollars more on sale, I won't buy non name brand again nor try to skim back on price because clearly you get what you pay for."
1.0,I am completely disappointed not only did it feel like the slightes rough playwill break it . It came looking like something on wish.co
1.0,Had to return this I was expecting something totally different like mirror type case that would be very shiny  and I thought it had a front cover clear case. It did not!
1.0,I was hard to put on and the filter doesn’t help with the breathing...it’s tight on your face and cause acne...
1.0,"Terrible fabric, terrible fitting. Definitely not suitable for girls 5’11 up."
1.0,Mask came with one broken horn and the chin part broken off. It didn't even include the broken parts so i could glue them on.
1.0,"These pants are terrible. They are way too short and too wide. I have two others that I bought in a store and they are wonderful. I do not believe they are truly made by the same manufacturer. I tried to take the hem down but it is so poorly sewn together that is not possible.  I can’t return them now that I have attempted to do that, so I’m stuck."
1.0,"Smaller than expected..<br />Not balanced,  keep  slipping out of the ear without the rubber sleeve"
1.0,Product does not come with cute saying and looks much cheaper than pictured.
1.0,arrived broken!!!!
1.0,Not like the other copper masks at all.  Tommy Copper is so much better.<br />Regret the purchase.
1.0,"This dress is HORRIBLE! Doesn't fit well, the material is just horrible! I would never buy this dress at all"
1.0,Arrived stained. Want a refund
1.0,These only include 10 masks so they are $1 each!!! Very disappointed.
1.0,This sizes super small n I order large to be safe but it fits like a small
1.0,I received the wrong shirt.
1.0,I ordered this (black) pair of leggings along with multiple other colors. Every other pair fit except these.
1.0,Big on the top and Tied on the bottom
1.0,I ordered this set of 3 mostly to have the largest one for a pendant. Only two showed up and the one I really needed wasnt included. They are fairly flimsy too.
1.0,"For starters, these are not sterling silver.  There are no .925 or 92.5 stamps.  They are sterling silver plated.  I received this response directly from the seller.  I compared the listing to the manufacturer's website and their information was also not truthful.  They say they work with vermeil and sterling silver yet they do not list the base metal.  The Amazon listing says the base metal is sterling.  The Shashi website also lists these as hollow and lightweight but boy are they heavy! The posts were yellow and bent and the clutches were cheap.  I wanted these earrings for so long but the price point was too high.  I finally pulled the trigger and I am so disappointed in the deception.  These are going back asap.  Do not buy them, especially if the seller continues to mislead the consumer by stating a sterling silver base.  Shame!"
1.0,This product is terrible. I used it just for one hour and it broken. It definitely is not original Nintendo product. It must be fake!!! Don’t buy it.
1.0,Looks like it was made in 10 seconds. Material is see through and very cheap. Size Large that I purchased would only fit up to a 6 year old girl. I can find better quality at the dollar store. Get what you pay for.
1.0,"2-6-2020.An update on this necklace. My neck and my chest got worse. Very severe itiching. I may have to go see an allergist. On my way to the dr. Now. All Amazon cared about was that I return this necklace. They didnt care about my allergic reaction.<br /><br />I  had a terrible, a very bad  allergic reaction to this necklace. All around my neck is red. A lot of red dots. Itching and itching. Very severely. So many people was raving about this necklace.  I never, never purchase cheap necklace. I will never purchase any jewelry that's not real gold. I'll be returning this necklace. I was told other people was allergic to this necklace too."
1.0,Not true to size need to order at least 2 sizes larger
1.0,1 day of use at a river and they ripped... Sad because I like the product but obviously the quality is bad.
1.0,The connector part that goes to the controller broke after a couple uses. Don’t buy. Breaks too easy for those that really use the oculus. Pay the $20 from oculus itself. It’ll last longer.
1.0,I bought 2 pair of these. They are cute but the band twisted in both after the first wash. I should have read the reviews because I see I am not the only one it happened to.<br />I also think the fit is too small.
1.0,Bought this product a size too big according to what the chart states and it fits a small child and not an adult
1.0,"Extremely disappointed. BLEEDS on the white. I loved this swimsuit and was so excited about, only to have the navy bleed all over the white around the bust area. I was hoping for a better quality material. I was excited and extremely disappointed."
1.0,We ordered 2 pair. Their ok but I'm not completely satisfied with mine. Mine are too tight..My husband basically feels the same
1.0,"Wire is flumsy, my granddaughter has trouble"
1.0,Not happy with purchase. Returned to seller.
1.0,Loved this item when it arrived however once I took it outdoors into the sun it melted. I would love a replacement.
1.0,Disappointing!!!! Waste of money!!
1.0,"Look at the reviews, these reviewers were bought out."
1.0,When put on the graphics are so distorted it’s hard to recognize the print
1.0,Extremely too large. Also too wide.
1.0,"This product is cheap, at best. The arms are about two feet, most adult arms measures three feet, the blower is inadequate for the task required. The Dino head just kind of droops over instead of completely inflating. When I asked my son to describe how I looked, goofy was his reply. Finally, the material is cheap leaving an unrealistic view of what should be a monster dinosaur."
1.0,The silver was so shiny it looked very cheap .
1.0,"It was to small, so I gave it away, sad, won't but with this again."
1.0,Junk... do not order
1.0,"Not quite as pictured and it definitely was not what I had in mind.  The jacket is completely separate from the inside gray "" hoodie"" and the ""hoodie"" is only a very cheaply put together ill fitting vest! The two pieces do not fit or go together well at all like shown in the photo.  The pink piece is also very thin.  I'll have to find a decent hoodie to try to match it with to make it look and fit properly.  Also, no drawstrings to cinch up the bottom and the pockets are not at an angle.  They go straight down, not for putting your hands in."
1.0,"It is said “you get what you pay for” but not even in this case – I paid too much!  I have bought skirts for less than $10 that were better quality than this skirt. The fabric looked cheap like that they use for kid’s Halloween costumes. The colors were not as pictured - navy as opposed to royal blue. Although I marked fit as expected, I cannot speak to the fit as I never tried it on. This was definitely not for me. Needless to say, I returned it and ordered a skirt made of 100% cotton."
1.0,After washing the item… quite a few of the “diamonds” fell off
1.0,"This stuff is pure junk. Was not worth the while to return and get a refund. I may have well just wrapped my finger with tape which is all this stuff really is, except paper tape is better and cheaper. Do not waste anyone's time in buying this stuff. Inventor of this should be sued."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS WE RECEIVED A BRACELET WITH A PENTAGRAM, DEVIL & GUN CHARMS! Not avengers at all! HORRIBLE!"
1.0,Terrible quality. I wore it once and the design on the edge came off. The lenses give a blue tint to everything and destroy depth perception.
1.0,The print is not aligned properly with the eyes of the mask.
1.0,It’s already peeling after 1st wash. Wouldn’t recommend it.
1.0,So far no problem with this apple watch band
1.0,Poor quality. I did not like the closure part of this choker. I can not wear it with everything because of the color of the closure. I put it in a drawer and have not worn it. I should have returned it because I did not like it when it was delivered.
1.0,"The shirt itself in the listing is so cute - but the actual shirt I rec’d - huge disappointment in quality of the graphic.<br />The text is fine, bold and clear. The shirt is fine. But the COW, it looks like a graphic that has very obviously been copied from elsewhere, then blown up and printed, and that’s exactly what it looks like. It is blurry and pixelated. Doesn’t look like it belongs, at all.<br />The photos do not do justice to the glaring discrepancy in the crispness of the printed text, and the heifer graphic.<br />Also, just a note on color, I thought the shirt was white and black. It is not, it is a light gray and black."
1.0,"Oh my god, I got a large and it literally went mid calf. I am 100% returning. I'm 5'5&#34;,150 dd and usually wear an 8"
1.0,"As frustrating as the bands that are made by fitbit are to latch, they never fall off. I liked the variety of colors these bands provided, but unfortunately they do not stay latched. Luckily mine flew off my wrists while still in my home, but I wouldn't chance using it and losing the expensive fitbit device."
1.0,this thing is not for men. Got a large felt like a medium and fit like a small
1.0,"This dress is beautiful, comfortable and fits well. The first time I wore it, I could see two weak spots in the fabric and didn't think it would survive its first wash. I exchanged it and the second one looked to be in better shape. I washed it in the machine in cold water on the hand wash cycle, hung it up to dry and saw a large hole in the back where the fabric was worn right through at the seam. I won't bother try a third, such a shame."
1.0,"Unattractive, huge. Threw mine away"
1.0,The picture Is Not What It Seems
1.0,"First of all, to be up front, I did not buy this umbrella here, but was so compelled to write a review of this ""windproof"" umbrella because I was amazed how this thing broke like it was a delicate glass ornament falling from the top of a 12 foot Christmas Tree. I used this umbrella TWICE. Once was when I first got it, just to check it out, the second time was during an actual downpour. I guess the old saying that it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside is true, but only for the health of said umbrella. I opened the umbrella, walked to my garage from my car, lowered the open umbrella to the floor to dry out, and it didn't survive a 3 inch drop to the ground. Literally. I'm 5'9, I lowered the open umbrella with my arm fully extended to the ground, had to be no more than 3-5 inches, and this ""windproof"" umbrella broke like it was nothing. I'd be willing to bet this umbrella couldn't withstand a fart, let alone the wind this ""vortex"" claims to withstand. BUT! It does have a lifetime warranty. So if you want to find or pay for a box, find time in your busy day to go to your post office with the world's most ""convenient"" hours, or UPS store, ect. pay to ship it to the manufacturer, wait 2-4 weeks for processing for them to decide if it's warrantable, then possibly get a new/refurbished umbrella, then no worries. Me? Nah... Shedrain, You got me for the $25 I spent on this umbrella, I'll go buy a different umbrella and you can keep this review.<br />FYI... most companies that stand by their products don't require the end user to send anything back. A picture usually will suffice of the defective product and the company that stands behind their product will ship new merchandise to their customers door, free of charge."
1.0,I hated these pants. I will not get them ever again and neither will anyone else. They suck!!!!!
1.0,"Don’t use if you have sensitive skin! Super cute but after having no issues with my belly button piercing I had done over 11 years ago, this jewelry turned my piercing red and painful within 20 mins (yes it was cleaned throughly with alcohol prior to placing)"
1.0,"Way to small, sweatshirt material. Another Asian made product that doesn't fit and cheaply made."
1.0,What is in display is not what I got. And quality is cheap
1.0,PRETTY RING BUT STONE WAS MISSING
1.0,The ring I received doesn’t look anything like the ringer ordered.
1.0,I wish I read the reviews before ordering because I wasted my money. This looks like an earring and sticks out of the nose way too far. Imagine taking one of your studs out of your ear and putting it in your nose - that is exactly how ridiculous this looks.
1.0,"This blouse was nothing like the write up and picture - very thin material - very short - way small..  I was very disappointed with quality and how long it took for this blouse to arrive.<br />I wish there was a zero star rating because that is what this blouse should receive, but in order for my review to post I needed to select a star rating - so it will be a 1 star."
1.0,Not worth buying..
1.0,Nice fabric and color(marine) but odd fit. Neckline too low and gaps open. Very loose at bottom
1.0,"I believe if the necklace was actually working when I received it, I could have styled it many times."
1.0,"One the worst pair of cotton gloves I have ever purchased.  Not only were they overpriced,they were thin like cheese cloth."
1.0,Tooooooooooo big for small sizes
1.0,"It was not as long as was supposed to be, it literally was a choker on m daughter as it left marks on her neck.  Made for very little child"
1.0,"The smell is awful, I like the fringe, that’s it. They appear cheaply made. I will be returning these boots. I would rather pay a higher price for a good quality boot and without the odor."
1.0,"This earring is terrible and not worth the money. I could not get the clip to hold onto my ear at all. I bought it for a Halloween costume, and I ended up putting the clip inside my ear because it wouldn't clip on. I would not buy again."
1.0,Didnt work from the day i got it. Imagine my surprise when i gave it to my wife as a birthday gift only for it not to work. We spent the entire day wearing it and shaking it. Took it to a jewler because the warrenty had past and found out it didnt have a balance wheel.
1.0,"Felt like the cheapest clingiest material ever! Not even like fabric,more like a cheap plastic tablecloth."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Only tried it on and the hems already coming loose. Will go back!
1.0,This pin is found on the floor more than on my clothes.  I have tossed it in the trash!
1.0,No sooner than  my granddaughter had them out of package  both lens popped out.  Cute  very cheaply made
1.0,These were nit oakley. Did not fit my glasses. Boooòoooo. Fake products from china
1.0,This product is way too small. I ordered a 2X and it is no bigger than a medium at best.
1.0,Don’t waste your money! Does not work very disappointed I was really looking forward to this
1.0,Too short.  Seemed cheap.  I returned
1.0,A large was like an extra small. I usually wear a med.
1.0,Not 20g. Can't even get it through my piercing.
1.0,"I was so disappointed with this dress. I went down a size and it was still huge; which is not common for me because I have large breasts and full thighs. The dress fit like more of an oversized pajama shirt. I also tried to tie it in the front like the model, but that was also a fail. It was so much fabric that it looked like I had a little something extra in the front if you know what I mean."
1.0,This dress is about 3 sizes too small and see through.
1.0,"las tallas o medidas son una mentira, queremos nuestro dinero que sea retornado<br />Gracias"
1.0,"Was not good quality, and not correct size"
1.0,"Cheap looking, my teenage son did not like it."
1.0,"Does not snap securely. You will lose your watch, don't waste your money! I speak from experience, sadly."
1.0,Looks nothing like the pictures and I paid 99 for it.
1.0,I waited a while for this to be shipped and when it was they sent me the wrong item. I got a cheap looking necklace that I gave to a friend daughter to play dress up with. Online it looks nice but not in person. They did refund me my money but it was very frustrating. Buyer beware.
1.0,Bought it late May...broken. Lasted 2 months. Don't bother
1.0,Very cheaply made would not buy again
1.0,"The elastic straps are SO uncomfortable. The elastic is stiff and rigid. If I hadn't already washed them, I would have returned them."
1.0,These are not one size fits all.  I was very disappointed in the size
1.0,First time this baby hit by water... all the cover pealled away... this is pure trash
1.0,After only 2 months the main stone has fallen out! I really loved this ring it’s kept it’s shine and luster. My only issue is the ston coming out.
1.0,"The quality of material is great! The underwear are comfortable and fit well... But the stitching on two of the four unraveled on the first wearing! two of the four pairs stitching came loose on the same exact side in the same exact spot (Left side stitching by the groin). 6&#34; of stitching that literally came undone on two pair while wearing the underwear within the first half hour of wearing them for the first time. I chocked the first pair up to being unlucky, but when the second pair did the exact same thing I think it is a manufacturing error."
1.0,"Seriously, I can't believe people are saying this shirt runs small. It is the opposite. It runs huge. It looks like I am wearing curtains!<br />I am 20 weeks pregnant, 140 pounds, 5'3. This shirt makes me look 40 weeks pregnant and 240 pounds! THE CUT IS AWFUL! Very unflattering. It is huge and the yellow part of the shirt has a seam that starts very high on the back so it looks like I am 40 weeks pregnant in the back too.<br />I have no problem looking pregnant, because I am,  but it is just way too much fabric and the cut is not complimentary.<br />Also there is no tag or tags on the inside that verify size or how best to wash.<br />I plan to return because the picture does not match the true way it looks on the body."
1.0,Not what is advertised. Cheap.
1.0,"The picture makes this top look lush and thick, it is not, it is a bit thin.  The picture makes the top look large, it is not, it is more fitted, if you want a loose fit, order a size or two sizes larger.  I washed this before wearing because of the fabric dye smell.  The stitching at the arm came undone, about a 5 inches space after one wash on the gentle wash cycle.  I had to stitch the hole back together.  The top is long enough, but tight across the chest.  I am 5'7"", if you are shorter than me the top might be too long for you.  The top seems to be designed for a A or B cup chest.  I am a fit person, not much body fat, and wear a size M in ready to wear.  If you are larger than me, then you may want to size up one or two sizes if you order this."
1.0,"Terribly flimsy...poor quality. Returning both of the 2 that I bought, need a refund"
1.0,Definitely returning. Too gaudy
1.0,The band broke the first day it was. Worn I'm not happy at all
1.0,"I had been Lands End customer for a long time, but recently am not, because the quality has gone down in recent years. This vest is another letdown. The fabric is very thin, feels like felt paper. Very disappointing."
1.0,"Shoes seem awesome, but the front seem opened after 2hrs of indoors wear. What a disappointment. Contacted seller for return and replacement. Original purchase made on the 8th,we are now the 22nd and no replacement in sight despite back and forth with seller CS. True disappointment. What a shame."
1.0,Hate the cheap
1.0,I can’t believe They are allowed to sell this garbage. Straight to the trash. Unwearable.
1.0,These pants fit from the waist. These pants are very long. Having them hemmed up would be okay if it didn't change the shape of the pant legs.
1.0,Fell apart within a couple weeks of use
1.0,"No matter how I tried to style this, it was bulky and frumpy looking. The color was a bit off too, more muted and dirty mauve than the pretty pale pink pictured. Disappointed so I returned it."
1.0,The material was not what I expected.  Cheaply made.
1.0,Not what I expected buttons are loose and loud to short from the back totally not worth the money.
1.0,One of my Barbie hearts broke a few days later and I didn't do anything to lossen or damage it.
1.0,Product cane with red stains !
1.0,Broke in 5 mins waste of money
1.0,not the way it looks on here. looks super cheap also very see through.
1.0,This is a very poor product. The watch fell apart in a few weeks.<br />I would like to have  a refund on the money I paid since the product was under warranty
1.0,"First time using them they would not stay on, clasp disengaging as soon as he hit the water.  Defective"
1.0,"I dislike that the size is to big , and I can’t return or exchange so I just had to get me another one in a small . So hopefully that one fits and I don’t waste money ."
1.0,Fit is too small and fabric is thin
1.0,Did not look like photo. Material is weird. Terrible quality. Fit was a little off as well.
1.0,I didn’t like anything about it .
1.0,"These are knit with very large gaps between the yarn.  This makes them completely uninsulated.  They're freezing to wear and in no way insulate your hands.  Don't even think of buying these absurd ""gloves""."
1.0,Cheap made the outside sole tore so fast didnt even last a month
1.0,This is a very cheap bag not worth the money at all. I gave it one star because it would not let me leave a review without a star it doesn’t deserve any stars at all.
1.0,es muy largo
1.0,I don’t like that the letters rub off a<br />After a few days
1.0,Not made well. All 3 pairs got holes in the heels after the first wearing.
1.0,Faded away after 6 months
1.0,I ordered the leggings and received a crop top . Kinda upset
1.0,The medium is very small
1.0,"My estimate is runs two sizes large. Not everything from this brand , just this top."
1.0,The fabric is so cheap! The shorts gap in the front… The hem of the shorts are completely uneven. And the jacket fits entirely too big. I was so disappointed. I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail. Not worth the money.
1.0,i wanted a size large and got a size Barbie.<br />my best friends baby is 2 and it fits her fine !?
1.0,Collapses under the weight of the outer dress.
1.0,Weird cut.
1.0,"The graphics on the t-shirt are completely illegible--nothing but a large blob of blur, nothing on the shirt is discernible. The photo someone else posted is a 100% improvement from the shirt I received.  Awful...do not waste your time or money."
1.0,"The shoes were initially great and exactly what I wanted for my 5 year old on our cruise. However, they didn't last a day walking around the ship. The seam ripped out of the toe, rendering them useless. Very disappointed."
1.0,heads are round...these are sewn square welllll...like a cross on top...makes it square...so i tossed em because they look like stupid...like a kid made it
1.0,The watch pictured is not the one ordered in June 2017. I ordered the SKMEI WR 50M. I never got it wet until recently when I was snorkeling in the ocean. I didn’t dive at all and the watch immediately leaked
1.0,Probably perfect for someone else.
1.0,This is not a skirt it's a half slip
1.0,"I ordered the pink floral pattern. It’s short, has a seem going down the front middle of the shirt  and it’s very unflattering and not stretchy. I’m 5’1 and the length is perfect for me so if you are any taller it will be a crop top lol. I’m returning it."
1.0,It's too small to wear as a dress.
1.0,I bought this to go to the Caribbean because I thought it was colorful and perfect. WRONG! The material feels like a bathing suit except more like a table cloth! WRONG pattern! It’s not as long as the picture I had to buy yoga shorts so my butt wouldn’t show! Don’t buy this cheap crap.
1.0,"While this is an adorable handbag, the quality is absolutely terrible. After less than 5 months, I am throwing it in the trash. The straps have been pulling loose from day one. I've been able to loosen the screws to replace the straps and tighten them up again, until finally one of them frayed so badly that it is beyond repair. The decorative pearl broke shortly after using the purse. The zipper on an inner pocket completely broke off. I'm not hard on my belongings. In fact, I've never had a purse wear out like this. I'm extremely disappointed. $29.99 is not a huge amount of money to spend on a purse, but it is enough to expect decent quality. Do not buy this purse."
1.0,I got to wear them twice before they started turning uglier than a copper penny. I know they are not real gold but I hoped to get more wear time
1.0,It fell apart the first time in the washing machine. The straps are frayed & so is the neck line. Very disappointed. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"These earrings looked amazing, but are poorly made. I only wore for a couple of days before one got lost and the other started to badly tarnish after I was hit with water baloons."
1.0,They arrived and looked beautiful but when I took them out of the package one fell apart it wasn't fasten worst ever as in guilty but the are beautiful
1.0,"Dont order- The actual dress doesnot look like the picture, the material is like a bathing suit and the dress is way too big for an xsmall - im an xsmall in all my clothing and also am 3 months pregnant right now and this dress was still big on me"
1.0,I'm an xl and it definitely was not an xl. It also was not stretchy material like it claimed. I returned it. I bought the navy one with floral print.
1.0,Too small and very difficult to put on!
1.0,"Not what I expected. I was hoping they were cotton. Material looks cheap. For around the house they are fine, they look like pajamas. The fit was true to my size which is small, but are way too long. Not everyone is 5'10."
1.0,Poorly made and too large
1.0,I can usually tell by how a model wears a dress when I need to size up and I did size up to a large in this one and it was still too tight and the material was very cheap. returned!
1.0,Very poorly fabricated shirt. Online product description and image are misleading.
1.0,The material did not look like picture. Looked and felt very cheap looking
1.0,These are not very flexible and do not conform well to the back of your head or neck.
1.0,Remove this NOW AMAZON THIS IS SPREADING HATE AND VIOLENCE
1.0,The quality of the socks was very poor... fabric too thin. I was looking for something thicker.
1.0,Pero si no lo e eresivido
1.0,This product is super cheap. The material is horrible. It's not even cotton. I washed it on cold one time and it already started pilling. Save your money.
1.0,It didn't stay on! A crappy product! Looked nice but kept falling apart!
1.0,The product is super super thin.
1.0,"I bought a JTC Belt bow tie at the same time and it's 100X better.  This is just a cheap piece of fabric loosely tied together.  Great for a very low end halloween costume, but given that the JTC Belt tie cost the same after shipping, I can only recommend going with a higher quality tie from them instead."
1.0,Wouldn't recommend... product showed up with scratches on the glass... I was excited till I seen this
1.0,Two charms fell off bracelet while I was wearing it and it quickly tarnished BADLY and turned a ugly copper color in places ... I’m a huge dog lover & I loved the bracelet but very poor quality ...do not buy you will be VERY disappointed after wearing it a couple weeks :(
1.0,Does not look like the picture that they advertised. Very cheap looking.
1.0,"At the beginning I like it, is wide as I want but after few weeks the internal rubber separates from the outer web"
1.0,"I love the color of the bracelet,  But if your wrist isn't equivalent to a 5 year old child DON'T waste your money  !! May I add I have extremely small wrist ."
1.0,"The seams were torn, the calves were far too big. I'm very disappointed in this product."
1.0,"I hated this. It looks nothing like the picture. The style is different, the fabric is different, the print is different, and so is the fit. It is like wearing a parachute and I would never order from this company again."
1.0,"I couldn't even get my arms in the sleeves, way to small."
1.0,I wear a size 6 shoe and these just push up and show!  I will probably give them away.
1.0,It was very short unfortunately. I really wanted to love it but it came out to be more like a sweater.
1.0,Don’t like the color. Way too different to describe.
1.0,These are probably the worst tunnels I’ve got online. I wouldn’t recommend getting them. They’re really flimsy and don’t hold their shape on your ears. But you get what you pay for.
1.0,Too small and difficult to return
1.0,"Nice but not as described: instead of cotton, it has 95% viscose and 5% spandex."
1.0,Main zipper to main compartment broke after six weeks rendering it useless for my purposes. Junk. Cheaply made.
1.0,Definitely not long enough to be advertised as a dress.
1.0,This was the most confusing band. Could not figure out how to remove the plastic links for sizing was too vomplex
1.0,Broke after wearing it to the office for a couple of weeks..
1.0,"Definitely not floor length like the picture shows. I ordered a size larger then I normally wear and it hit me mid calf and the sleeve hit me above the wrist. Fabric is not stretchy, I don't recommend buying."
1.0,These gloves rip easily and are ill fitting. Do yourself a favor and buy quality gloves. I ended up going to my local Costco and purchasing the Kirkland brand with is much more reliable
1.0,Leather is extremely thin.  Rear buckles are too close together to fit normal pants.
1.0,"When I first opened the package I noticed it came with a hard case and a bag case, which was nice. The first door I wore these, I was by my pool. These glasses did not block to sun at all and made anything in the sun look dark and hard to see. When someone was walking up to me, you can only see their outline, not their face or any details of them. These glasses are cute, but you can't wear them on a sunny day."
1.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; ,usually a size 10/12 and curvy. I ordered the large and could barely get this dress to fit over my bottom and it was way too short, may look beautiful on a petite and thinner person but not for tall or curvy ladies."
1.0,It broke the first time I tried it on.
1.0,"The place for the chain is too low. It keeps flipping over, so that you can't see the peacock feathers. It hangs like an upside down heart."
1.0,I ordered the white dress I’m 160 5ft3 dress was nothing like the picture it was too big and loose fitting quality sucked really disappointed and does not look nothing like the picture !!
1.0,Piece of junk DO NOT BUY!... there's other ones for the same price thag are better and have a good rep but these truly suck... the clamp broke when I tried to put it on literally in a bunch of little pieces again DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Dress is cheaply made. Entire bottom of the dress is black/dark colored before even wearing it.
1.0,"Other reviewers mentioned that this dress ran small and that was a HUGE understatement. It runs a size or two small. I bought another dress at the same time in the same size and it fit well. I was so disappointed, because the material and print were beautiful."
1.0,The style is great.  The quality of the frame is not.  I have had three pair and on each the temple breaks off by the ear.
1.0,it fell apart while working
1.0,They were what I wanted but one earing was broken. The rainbow had came unglued from the post.
1.0,Top of glasses too strong<br />  Not worth returning.  Will donate.
1.0,"I originally bought these several months ago; lost one while working so I bought another pair to replace them.<br />The 2nd pair was smaller than the original, so I returned them.<br />The original pair was almost 1.5"" in diameter(43mm).<br />The replacement pair I ordered was only 1"" in diameter but on the product description it says they are supposed to be 1.5"".<br /><br />So I tried buying another pair, the description says 43mn, and yet again they are too small. So I have to return them again. :("
1.0,Gracias. Poner el size S y envian uno XXL
1.0,Its a big massive sheet. The torso is for someone who might be 4'9 and the leg length for someone who is 6ft. There is tons of material that just doesn't fit right. If you return it you have to pay for shopping and it takes up to 1-2 MONTHS to get your money back. Absolutely unacceptable. Deserves a Zero star rating
1.0,I ordered two pairs and both came with holes in them which made them slide off my arms because got inside. Not worth the money at all.
1.0,Easy to break. Wouldn't buy again
1.0,did not like it way too small
1.0,Looks and feels great just that the bottom fits vut the top is too small..
1.0,So sharp it actually pierced my skin.
1.0,"This only fits little kids. I bought this while searching womans. Waste of time, money, and very disappointing"
1.0,"Looks fashionable online but the actual product has a lot to be desired. First thing I noticed when I put on the jacket was how cheap and thin the material felt, definitely not a product worth $31. Secondly when I tried to adjust the draw chord for the hood, the right chord just snapped off!! Didn't even have this jacket for 5 minutes and it was already falling apart, just another testament to how cheap the product is. If you want to buy this jacket because of its style then fine, but don't expect any real quality for what you're paying for (or for it to last very long). Honestly very disappointed."
1.0,Absolutely massive. 0-3 month is sized like a 2T.
1.0,"I got two of this hat not long ago about a month and half ago. I used it very comfortable but when I putted in washer it a few times, first time is fine, second nothing happened, and third time the cap nap in half."
1.0,"Cute idea, bad manufacturing ... hole in mask was too big and therefor the plastic piece fell out leaving it just a mask with a cut hole. Still had visible fringe from the hole, very cheaply made. Had to sew it myself into the mask leaving me to wonder why did I pay so much for this when I could just have done it my self for a few dollars since I ended up having to make it myself. I could have just bought a plastic cap piece and sewed it in any of my masks myself."
1.0,This is very lightweight and cheap. The &#34;silver&#34; parts are flimsy plastic beads. The leather is thin. I would have been embarrassed to give this as a gift. I'm so glad I didn't have it sent directly to the person it was for.
1.0,The size is not real
1.0,Worthless product. Nothing held in place in the key cover. Save your $
1.0,El vestido llegó roto en la parte de atrás y el zipper mal cocido. Totalmente decepcionada
1.0,Entirely too small. Does not fit regular size head. Wish I could give it zero stars.
1.0,Not real silver it turned this color after 2 weeks. It’s getting rusty/ brass colored. 925 silver does not do this.
1.0,Fell apart first time I tried to put I on.  Beads sprayed everywhere.
1.0,Looks and feel cheaply made :(  I didn't save the box to return.  Definitely do not think it was worth the $20 I paid for it on Prime Day
1.0,This is stiff plastic and small. It smells bad too. I bought it as a gift. Would be embarrassed to give it. I discarded it.
1.0,This product was cheap and I wasted my money.  It was a gift and I will not give to my great nephew for Easter.  Name is an iron on patch and you can see it.  It is terrible and I should have never purchased it.  Total disappointment.
1.0,"Material is like cheap cheese cloth very inferior, don't waste your money."
1.0,Loved them but after trying them on and taking them off again a couple hours later they broke. I didn’t even get to wear them out.
1.0,They are very cute but they are thicker than normal earrings and much shorter. Couldn't unscrew all of the backs off.
1.0,Don't buy !! It is 3 to 4 sizes too small
1.0,Didn't fit AT ALL! Got the biggest size and it's made for a doll or something not a real person.
1.0,"Very Small, will not fit 11in thin laptop. I was finding it very difficult to fit small folders and other small items in this bag."
1.0,Very thin flimsy material. Two inches too short. I’m 5’ 6”.  Would not recommend
1.0,"This just doesn't fit the ZTE Quartz.  The Quartz calls for 22mm bands, this band measures 20mm and leaves awkward gaps and exposed pins that both look bad and don't make it seem very secure.  Back it goes."
1.0,Very cheaply made piece of jewelry and I'm very disappointed.
1.0,This item had no features as described.
1.0,Had to return it; XXL fits like a large
1.0,"We ordered a 6t and it was extremely long and definitely would fit an 8yo, but the waste seems small, so not sure how these would fit anyone."
1.0,This reminds me of the sort of thing I would have carried as a child. It is very cheap feeling and strange.
1.0,"Very bad it feels like it is made from very chip leather ,it got ripped  2nd day. Do not buy this,no good ,trust me"
1.0,"Fun pant, lousy fit. Way too narrow for anyone w/ hips...at all.  Order a size or 2 up. Offered a partial refund because they shipped from China. Why is that MY problem?"
1.0,Recommended size but too tight.  Very flimsy material.
1.0,These do not fit my watch as it says it should. For a completely different size.
1.0,This is so embarrassing thos is Total garbage . You can't even read it let alone see it's a owl
1.0,Cheap. The zipper broke after the first wash.
1.0,I'm return the first dress #6 because to small . No refund in my credit card. I buy other one #8 is two big
1.0,"Could not get on my ear, to big."
1.0,This product ended up Shrinking it from a women’s large to about a child’s large very poor quality of material
1.0,"bought these sunglasses, feel like they were made in china with cheap material, the one costal logo fell off the side and now the paint is coming off, I paid alot more than they are asking now. they must relize they have a problem. if you are going to wear these around the house i guess they will stand up to that. as fas is fishing is concerned that is a whole other story. frames suck but lenses seem OK.<br /><br />4 out or 10"
1.0,Second time buying & I ordered a size up & it's still to small! Smh.
1.0,"Poor material, very cheap looking .... Yuck!!!!! Do not buy...."
1.0,Cute but broke in 10 minutes trying to change a charm.
1.0,It was so oversized that I returned it.
1.0,"does not look anything like the picture, and it fits really weird. i cannot wear it."
1.0,One earring was fine but the other one was broken and had chipped paint
1.0,I am so disappointed. I bought it for my daughter. Unlike how it shows in picture it does not fit well won't be embarrassed to give as a gift.
1.0,Tarnished after 2 weeks
1.0,Beyond waaay too small. Ordered 3 sizes up and could pull over knees
1.0,Horrible smell that took over my entire room. Like it was soaked in garlic and onions. Wish I had seen the other reviews that said this as well.
1.0,"The most ugly thing I have bought, looks like an old lady scarf. Nothing like the picture!"
1.0,Way way to small. It is child sized
1.0,Did not hold anything in and made a funny shape out of the butt area. Also you can tell when you are wearing this in materials that are not of denim material
1.0,The material seems to be nice and thick but it is not as contouring as the photo might suggest. Just looks like a night shirt.  The size chart might be a little off.
1.0,Very upset with the seller. I needed the shirt ASAP it shows navy with a white check it’s navy with a great check plus the tickets is $28 and I paid $33
1.0,"The color on this tunic was no where near the same color shown in the photo. I am average height and the tunic was a third of the way down my shin instead of near the knee. The fabric was also not cotton, it was some sort of blend."
1.0,"really too small, I am sending it back"
1.0,"Sizes run small, leave ligature marks."
1.0,Cheap Chinese bonded leather. Not real solid leather. But hey at $16....still don’t need to falsely advertise this as real solid leather.
1.0,Too small it went into my skin
1.0,It lasted a week and broke.
1.0,"Stitching is very strange-it’s like it was done backwards…look at the pics before purchasing, I plan to return mine-too awkward"
1.0,The fit is kind of frumpy. It is soft but there is no shape and so you look like you just got out of bed.
1.0,Well absolutely didn’t like these for they don’t lay properly in the ears
1.0,Clasp is broken doesn't hook on 1
1.0,I used to have the Nike sandals with the soft thong which is what I thought I was buying (that's my fault for no paying close enough attention).  The thong piece is hard plastic and incredibly uncomfortable between my toes.  No way I can wear these throughout the day without discomfort.<br /><br />I don't understand how this product passed Nike's quality team!
1.0,"In approx 24 hours the black ball that was on the top of the silver peg you can see in the picture I attached, popped off. I don't do anything that requires physical exertion. I truly loved the band until it quickly broke!"
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter. Perhaps it is a child's size because it was tiny. There was a bad chemical smell, too."
1.0,Polo cut is off ... doesn’t really hang nicely and the  material is very cheap and ruff
1.0,Second mask that does not function.
1.0,"Solo me llego una pulsera, me ase falta la otra"
1.0,Way too narrow in front.  About as much room as I'd expect for women's bikini panties.  A full 1 inch narrower than comparable sized Hanes or Jockey.  Not comfortable; stuff hangs out the sides.  It is not just a problem of the briefs being too small; the overall fit is fine.  Picking a larger size would simply make the briefs too big and possibly not address the problem at all.
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!! Poor material.  Wore once and it looked like I had for years wotm and fuzzy. I can't even imagine what it will look like after washing. And when return was requested you are expected to pay for returning!!
1.0,Super cute. But letters are already peeling off after one wash.
1.0,Runs way too small!!!
1.0,"Too big if you have a small wrist, and it's impossible to make it smaller"
1.0,"This is a piece of junk and the lowest leather quality ever I met with a wallet. Only after 3 days of usage I found the its fake leather and peeling along the side of the whole wallet, unfortunately I don't live in US and I can't return it back, but I would not recommend it at all unless there was a real customer care support from the merchant to find me a solution"
1.0,Very cheap and looks nothing like the picture. Only lasted me about 4 days into it fell apart.
1.0,"horrible QC on this product, the 2 belts are inches off of each other in size.  the black one is too small, of course I tried the brown one first."
1.0,This is the cheapest made purse I have ever bought in my life. I carry my wallet lipstick and cigarettes thats all and both of my handles broke off within 4 days of carrying it I had to take it to a shop and spend a good  it of money to have them fixed so they would hold up. Very dissappointed in the quality but I love the colors and design just very cheaply made
1.0,It was so small that you couldn't tell what it was. A waste of twenty dollars
1.0,crummy not suitable to be seen in public.
1.0,First time wearing the goggles.<br />Daughter dove in... They broke right off her face during competition.
1.0,Even I replaced new batteries I had to move my car almost hit garage door to open by remote<br />Distance to operate remote too short
1.0,did not receive them.  I really wanted this too.
1.0,It is very thin and a little see-through.
1.0,Cheap material! Don't buy. Too small
1.0,Mala calidad a la primer lavada se le hicieron bolitas.
1.0,Crotch is a light color ! Would like them if it was the same ! So weird
1.0,Very cheap material. Very cheap looking jacket. I apparently got what I paid for.
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter and it fit really weird...she is thin and does not have much of a chest. Fit at top of the chest and was large just underneath the chest and then tight at legs. Cute suit, just weird sizing."
1.0,They do not stay together! I bought these for my flower girls to wear for my wedding and they kept falling apart. They could not wear them. :'(
1.0,"I'm sure this sweater is super warm, but it's really itchy, so you need to wear a shirt under it. I felt like it fit a little boxier than other Prana items I have as well. I didn't really care for the rope through the waist band bottom either. I ended up returning it, mostly because of the itch factor though. The color was really nice and the fabric looked hi-end though."
1.0,Should have known better. Not a coat. A light jacket at best. A sweatshirt would be better.
1.0,"Clearly states &#34;Men's 12 Pack Colorful Funky Patterned Socks&#34;. This is misleading as the socks are very random sizing and feels more geared towards women as you can also view in the comments of this product..<br />When I say random sizing I mean that when I opened 4 socks, 3 of them were all different variations of tight on my leg, and 1, I could not even get on my foot!<br />I wear a size 9 in Men's Dress shoes and 10 in Athletic shoes for reference.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product as I will be returning it for the misleading product description. Does not serve the purpose that I bought this product for. These are women's socks.<br /><br />1/5<br />-WOW"
1.0,Socks ripped the same day it arrived.
1.0,These can hardly be considered compression tops.
1.0,Color was not exact (green was more of a hunter green). Runs big and material doesn’t breath.
1.0,"Literally doesn't stay on the knee. How disappointing, kept riding up and down and were so tight that it was very uncomfortable for my son (9 months)."
1.0,"Not sized for women, juniors sizing. Not proportioned right either"
1.0,This pair was very disappointing. Sock is thin material and when it stretches its very faded. There is also a seam that runs through it.. Looks like a run but it's not. Would not recommend
1.0,"First, the beard is NOT EVEN close to what is shown. Second, the boots are cloth covers NOT boots, Third, the belt is very small and frail and the suit does not have belt loops to hold it up. Lastly, I wore this thing twice and the zipper came undone under the whatever thing it is you pull on. The bottom part easily pulls out of the holder. The second time it happened, I tried to pull the zipper back down and it came completely off. So there I am meeting and greeting hundreds of kids with safety pins coming undone. While it was comfortable overall, it is NOT what is shown and the quality is very poor."
1.0,"Don't waste your money. This thing is unwearable and impossible to sleep with. Inside surface is rough and warms up the areas it covers making falling asleep difficult. Maybe that's how it's intended to stop you from snoring, by stopping you from sleeping."
1.0,"okay so it looks really nice and everything.. but uts so damn uneven. like the chains are not at all even wtf. so yeah, dont get it :/ and its toooo big too"
1.0,Sorry but are cheaply made. The lenses Pop out easily. Unfortunately I’ve lost one of Lens.
1.0,I didn't like it. It doesn't hold my butt. I ordered M because the reviews and it's big for me. I am 5'3 and weight 140 pounds.
1.0,Fit was too tight in the legs.  They look more like leggings after I washed them and I did not dry them!
1.0,Arrived In non working condition. Cannot get back plate off.<br /><br />Completely useless Chinese crap!
1.0,Belt was too long and didnt fit as it was not 30 waist and up more 36 and up
1.0,The inner lining will easily come out and it's impossible to put the gloves on afterwards. It left me stranded at the summit of Kilimanjaro. Do not rely on this glove.
1.0,Warm and fits correctly however the zipper broke within a few weeks :-/
1.0,I was very disappointed with this swim suit.  I bottom half fit way too small and the top part was way too large.  I am a 34C and the top was still too large.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"It so bad that you think a child made it, dont buy it you will be sorry spending your money on it, am returning it immediatly"
1.0,"This is a cute dress... for a non-pregnant person or maybe even first to early second trimester.<br /><br />This is advertised as &#34;maternity&#34; -- it is NOT maternity.  I have ordered several dresses that are nearly identical to this one, even from Beachcoco, but this style is a regular maxi dress."
1.0,The stone fell out two hours after I put it on
1.0,Much smaller than it appears in picture.
1.0,Zipper ripped the first time I went to pack. Not impressed and would not buy again.
1.0,"The listing shows a usb connection, which could be used with a rechargeable battery. However, it came with a round connection. I want my money back."
1.0,This was very awkward fitting. The bodice came up under my breasts!! It was very strange. Definitely not for me.
1.0,I wear a L to XL in most brands.  I ordered a 2X to make sure the dress is big enough and I can't even get it over my head.
1.0,"Broke immediately, shipping was very long. Would pass."
1.0,I now see how they manipulated the picture the way the girl is holding it. it's way too large at the bottom that's why the girl in the picture is holding it like that
1.0,Way smaller than I thought!
1.0,They only lasted 2-3 weeks before falling apart🙄Don't waste your money .
1.0,"Very cheap quality.  The material is a slippery cheap polyester, not a soft sweatshirt material at all. Returning as I am embarrassed to give this as a gift."
1.0,"These yoga pants are extremely thin & see through. I was expecting them to be as thick as sweats but, was completely underwhelmed with this purchase. I can’t even think of anything good to say about these yoga pants. I even feel bad for the poor delivery driver that took time out of his day to deliver this item to me. I’d rate this no stars if i could. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL."
1.0,Very or should i say an Extremely bad quality of print or design
1.0,I have a long torso so I intentionally bought the longest under shirts I could find however after a few washes and dries they became the shortest shirts in my drawer
1.0,This is plastic garbage.
1.0,Item description was not proper and the threads were coming loose already when I received the item . The item came stitched ( top / kameez) and bottom part just came as loose fabric !! Don't be fooled by their &#34;semi stitch&#34; definition. Asking for refunds and most importantly not a helpful seller.
1.0,This dress was so badly made. The neck is skewed to one side and way too wide. It’s smaller than expected. And there are stitches falling off. Not worth the money at all!!
1.0,I once used a BDU belt to hold up a drive shaft while we replaced a transmission on a deuce and a half. This isn't the same quality. But it's good enough to hold up my pants while I mow the yard. The buckle has &#34;made in Taiwan&#34; stamped on the back. And the buckle keeps popping loose and sliding off the belt. This is more Rothco style junk.
1.0,It is much too small in every way
1.0,"Does not run trye to size. I'm a xl and ordered a xxl, but couldn't even get it over my head. My daughter who wears a small could wear it perfectly. Revamp your sizing charts or you certainly will be getting tons of returns. Luckily I didn't mind passing this along to my daughter or I would have been returning it also."
1.0,Extremely cheap construction. Over a week late receiving. Will return if at all possible.
1.0,"These socks are not as described, not a cushioned foot bed as stated. Will not recommend"
1.0,Very slow process and buy beware it cost me 15.06 to send them back terrible the first return address was China so they give me a US address so I lost money on some tight jogging pants terrible buy beware
1.0,Visors are permanently bent. Snaps to close under chin are on the wrong side of scarf and look ridiculous when snapped. On one snap I had to bend one of its prongs down in order to try and snap it. Junk.
1.0,This is disgusting to see. BUY FROM INDIGENOUS BUSINESSES AND NOT THIS INAPPROPRIATE DISRESPECTFUL MONEY HUNGRY BUSINESS! Culture appropriation people! So wrong.
1.0,Too hard to do it by myself
1.0,"The display picture doesn’t indicate birds, which I wasn’t crazy about. Will be returning."
1.0,Terrible quality. The dress looked and felt very cheaply made and looked almost nothing like the image. I returned it immediately.
1.0,This product broke after 1 use. The watch band snapped and now I have to replace the band.
1.0,"My son swims 3 times a week., I bought these two months ago and the chlorine ate right through them. They faded and became saggy within a month. Definitely not worth the money."
1.0,Doesn't whistle or look nearly as appealing as the picture when you get it. What's the point?
1.0,Poorly made. Broke after one use and made my ears hurt bc they are not real silver or whatever
1.0,"I got these for my husband.  They fit well, as I expected they would.  But the butt seams in all 3 pair didn't hold up at all.  The material was thinner than I expected but I certainly didn't think they'd rip out in the butt seam on all 3 pair.  Going back to Union Bay.  A little more money but not much, and definitely worth it."
1.0,"It’s frustrating to see manufacturer is SO CHEAP With Labor costs  that no button hole is provided; esoecily for the price. The fabric is cheap too. There are no buttons on the Sleeves; instead your left with oversized sleeves which make dress look poorly made. . They put a a elastic slip not, which is so small FOr larger US Fingers to button.<br />Suggesting you don’t buy this dress."
1.0,Way too big for my face.  Returning
1.0,THIS SHOES STARTED TO SHRED WITH IN THE 1ST WEEK AND BROKE WITH IN 4 MONTH.<br />DO NOT GET THIS SHOES GET THE Crocs(tm) Capri WHICH HAS A BETTER TOP AND LAST LONGER. IT ABOUT $6 DIFFERENT.
1.0,"Bought as a gift for grand daughter , being used for INSIDE of home, really junky and cheaply made .."
1.0,The size is way off. About 3 sizes too small.
1.0,cheap....seam tore apart first time wearing it
1.0,This mask feels and resembles a deflated football.  They misrepresented the product completely.
1.0,Made of a cheap material and looks very cheesey in person
1.0,They are huge. If they were a smaller size they'd be georgous but the size just makes them gauky looking. It is suzecof your whole ear lobe. Very heavy also. I know out of stock but wouldn't recommend if they come back.
1.0,I could not put it on anywhere for the life of me...soo small. Its so unimpactful I still havent been able to find it to return it :)
1.0,Earring were to small
1.0,Seriously???  Check out the 'bi-focal' lenses on each lens.  And why are they bifocals?  I didn't order bifocals.  The quality is absolutely appalling.  They are getting returned.
1.0,Legs were uneven.
1.0,"Liked the look of the shoes, however had to return - way too small - normally take a 9.5 - ordered 10.5 still small."
1.0,The fabric is gross. I returned it!
1.0,The studs kept pulling out all the time.  Needs a different type of retainer.
1.0,I ordered the XXlarge and they were way too small! They were made in China so I recommend sizing up. I sent them back
1.0,I got a large and I am a size 10
1.0,It came broken. The color was all wrong....but I guess.. What do you expect for the price? The only positive is that the necklace can be easily repaired.
1.0,Poor quality! I washed this item and it's not wearable. One time wear ONLY!!!
1.0,"I ordered my first pair, they broke straight out of the box. I ordered a replacement, well what do you know - they break that same day. I ordered a third pair, yes I didn’t learn my lesson, they broke right away.<br />Very pretty but just poor quality."
1.0,They were very tiny and very cheaply made. I didn't pay much for them so I didn't expect much but one of them I had to bend into shape to work.
1.0,"I'm not sure how these can be called sunglasses!!  Absolutely NO protection at all.  I was excited to get these, but when they arrived it was a huge let down.  No protection at all...just gradient brown lenses."
1.0,Material pulls.
1.0,They did not prevent the glare for night driving.<br />I feel as if it just intensified the glare.
1.0,can't see the yellow and doesn't look like a daisy
1.0,"This sizing if for China. I'm a 6'3'' 245 lb American man and this shirt is pretty much like putting on my wife's gym shirt. In reality it's about a small and I normally wear xl shirts. I'm size 36 waist. I workout a ton so I have muscle mass. However this would be great for swimming or surfing since it's literally skin tight and the arm sleeves go all the way to the elbows<br />However the short is short, I goes to my waist exactly. So if I swim it'll become a mid drift shirt and I'll look like a guy wearing half a skin tight shirt on the beach. I would recommend this product if you go at least 2 sizes up. At least. I can't stress that enough."
1.0,Way too small. Made in China size so it’s extremely small
1.0,"I bought this gloves base on the reviews here. I thought there is something special about this gloves because it cost $[...] plus $4 shipping for a pair. This thing is made of a thin piece of cotton cloth, what is so special about this? It looks like one of those disposable gloves and there is no way this thing is going to last. This is the worst item that I bought from Amazon, this item belongs to dollar store."
1.0,Poorly made wore once and it fell apart on my neck.
1.0,Not true to fit. I want my money back.
1.0,Ordered these for work as I am a nurse who is required to wear a surgical mask daily during this pandemic and was hoping to sew buttons on them to protect my ears. Description says 2 pack but I only received one headband in my order. Disappointed.
1.0,Not a fan of this product. and the company does not respond for returns.
1.0,Ridiculously big! They are huge on me! I have a small face and these were comical looking on. Gave them away or I would have returned.
1.0,tb very honest I'm not sure if it was the stitching or if I got the wrong size... the fit felt bulky and tight all at the same time. I think it would've been cute if it fit :-(<br />Note: I'm 5 ft 90 lbs. bought a small but u might wanna go M.
1.0,"I was looking same type earrings, but much smaller! They call them hugging earrings."
1.0,Grnde
1.0,Very loose fit below the knees .not skinny enough
1.0,"The battery died within one week of purchase. I liked the way the watch looked, so I thought I was going to keep it and discarded the box, so I can’t even return it. :("
1.0,Poor quality weird seam like it had been stitched in a random spit.
1.0,It’s a horrible material. It’s like you’re wearing a piece of paper.
1.0,The whole outfit fit ackwardly. The bottom is way too big on the tummy portion and super loose for a size small. The top fits ackwardly on the chest and the padding on the chest is big. A size small would fit great for anyone with a C cup or larger. I am a size B so it was like wearing a loose t shirt.
1.0,i got the dress but did not receive the crown ..  ... i am returning it
1.0,this was a joke how do you call it X-large when the cup size fit a A cup lady never again
1.0,"I returned it, was too small"
1.0,only received 1 of from the set of 5.
1.0,This item started to fall apart after 2 months.
1.0,I put it on today for the first time and the clasp broke. Really disappointed. Didn't even get out of the house. ☹️
1.0,Can't read the words on it at all and looks like the paper which is dipped in water and blurred
1.0,No backs came with earrings
1.0,The jeans were described as size 18w  short. The pair sent were  18 short and had to be returned.
1.0,It's small and tight
1.0,The tie was defective. The lights didn’t work and they don’t stay on.
1.0,"2 of the 7 pieces came broken and one has sharp metal sticking out. One ball is missing a gem, it wasn't in the bag so I can't just repair it myself, just doesn't have one. Worse is the one that was assembled backwards or something.. I can try to fix it myself but these are very cheap so it'll probably just snap the metal. One has sharp metal material stick off where it goes through your skin... sounds very painful. I'm gonna try to file it down myself, I'm glad I caught that before trying it. So maybe inspect your firsts.<br />Also, I can just tell the color of metal will fade quickly.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />DO NOT BUY!<br />Caused a big, itchy rash and turned black within a few days!!!<br />And I cannot take it out because it caused a massive infection! I'm on antibiotics! It's been since Nov. 25th and it's now Dec. 9th. STILL is painfully red and infected. Learn from my mistakes, don't even consider these rings."
1.0,This belt sucks!
1.0,I received the pats ok they are missing a button and button hole the cuff is Not straight  the cuff shows the thread on the outside of  pants  and they are an inxh to long
1.0,Beautiful but already faded to plain silver and am missing 5 little stones already. Cheap ring I guess ya get what ya pay for but it’s not even a month old. Would’ve had 5 stars if it had actually stayed looking like what I ordered.
1.0,"Absolutely do not look as pictured. Not only do they fit very small, they look like “granny shorts“"
1.0,I bought this to have some kind of support after my shoulder surgery when I cant wear a bra. After half hour I was so sweaty just from driving to an appointment in AZ summer with ac that both my brassieres came off. They wont stuck well if have any kind of sweating. I pur based nipple covers and boob tape which worked much better. Unfortunately due to my return window closing a few days ago I missed my opportunity to return and refund. I only wore 1 of the 2 pairs and three different times with such a bad experience I am not wasting my time on the other pair nor any further attempts.
1.0,These were extremely large for a child or even an adult. I thought since they were too big for my 9yr old that I could wear them myself but was wrong. They are way too big.
1.0,"Belt came in. Went to put on my buckle, and the buttons became detached so that I could not use it."
1.0,Have a pair of black polarized fast lines and there great.  Theses lenses on the other hand suck! They have horrible glare. Windows turn into mirrors and anything wet shimmers and reflects as well.  They frames are cool but polarized lenses suck.
1.0,"I did not have any problems in the bust as others have (I'm a 36B) however, this thing ripped after wearing it twice. Too bad, it's cute and comfortable."
1.0,"I read review after review, and several said true to size. I am a medium but I take a large cause I have broad shoulders. This large shirt is skin tight."
1.0,Super cheap... nail clipper doesn’t even work!
1.0,This fabric doesn't prevent smells as it states it seems to absorb every possible body odor. Fit is small and snug. So disappointed. Loved the print.
1.0,Cute but broke
1.0,Dress arrived damaged with holes and discoloration in several areas. Very cheap quality
1.0,The earrings are two different lengths and the post on one is opposite the red bead so it faces backward. Not to mention the packaging which was in tight saranwrap which took forever to get off.
1.0,"Weird, heavy fabric"
1.0,Cheap material with no give. Sized way too small
1.0,I was sent a different print and the material in all synthetic. No good
1.0,"Don't stay in ear, cute but not worth the hassle."
1.0,I bought these for my 10yr old son for baseball and the were way too small
1.0,Lasted 5 days before it fell apart. Absolute JUNK!!!
1.0,Poorly designed. Parts continuously fall off during  assembly because the connecting parts are too loose. Instructions are poorly translated. Diagrams are poorly drawn.
1.0,"Just got these in the mail and couldn’t be more disappointed. The style looks unisex and is extremely baggy in the butt / front so it’s not flattering. Thought about taking them to the tailor, but between the cheap material- it won’t be worth it."
1.0,Beyond small looks like a kid dress and definitely will only cover up to my belly
1.0,Terrible can’t get them on. Sewed shut from the beginning no instruction no help on line
1.0,"They were too small! I tried returning all of them, I only got refunded for one! Very unhappy with them! 😞"
1.0,Wrong size in the packaging that was labeled with the correct size ... Won't take the chance of ordering again
1.0,"This item was not as expected,poor thin fabric & the back of the pants behind the knee area has  a slits like the front,totally different from the picture shown,very dissatisfied"
1.0,It arrived in the shipping window but it took much longer than 2 days. It is also very short. I’m 5’9” and it’s more like shorts on me. Also very very wrinkled. Very unhappy with this purchase.
1.0,"Very uncomfortable.  Maybe over time they would become so, but don't want to go through the effort.  Returning them."
1.0,"It really isn't worth the pay, falls off really fast."
1.0,Turned green the 2nd day I wore it TRASH!
1.0,Gosh beautiful watch but clasp is impossible to open.  Totally wrong clasp.  Battery not working too
1.0,it was to small in the arms. i bougt 3xl and fits like 2 size smaller in the arms
1.0,The design on the skirt is pixelated. It looks terrible. The fabric quality of the skirt is also terrible. The shirt is alright.
1.0,Very heavy earrings. I am unable to wear them.
1.0,Baby size
1.0,"It's cute but I prefer everything to be symmetrical and unfortunately, this dress isn't. I am very disappointed. I had to buy a secondary dress."
1.0,Once again. Size chart is not correct.  If i had known I was ordering fekm a China I would have not.  Had this happen before with they're size charts
1.0,It said t runs small but OMG I normally wear a Med so I ordered a Large and my arms wouldnt even fit in the shirt
1.0,"This not only leaked, everything inside the waterproof part was soaked, including my husband's cell phone.  Very disappointed.  Would not recommend this at all."
1.0,Broke as I was taking it out of the package. Very disappointed
1.0,Made my necklaces more tangled and broke after a week of use.
1.0,It enough size variety
1.0,So small and cheap quality. Couldn't get them closed after i opened them.
1.0,The gotcha fell out of the band in my first week of using it.
1.0,This was a shame. I bought a 2xl and it looked like it was a medium. The material is flimsy and very cheaply made. I am sending it back asap!
1.0,"Major camel toe!! I ordered a medium, the top perfectly. However the bottoms are a major miss. They are not flattering around the bottom area at all. Definitely needs a new seam design"
1.0,"I was really looking forward to receiving these septum rings ..but right when I opened the package I noticed that the rings seemed really tiny compared to the septum piercing I got when I got it pierced . Only one fit me fine the other 3 weren't even visible and the hoop one didn't even go in at all . It's a shame since these were so pretty ): In the pictures , Mine is the silver one . I bought these in rose gold . You can tell that the ones I bought are alot smaller than the one I had on me ."
1.0,I had to fight with the seller to return this dress. The neckline was way up under my chin if wearing the straps. The back would not even close to close even though I ordered a size up from what I thought I needed according to the size chart.
1.0,"At a glance the pants look nice, the material is soft, stretchy and very thin. But the quality of the pants are HORRIBLE and CHEAP the pockets are not constructed right and the jeans are not skinny they are ankle. I am disappointed will be returning so cheap if I keep them I can probably only get one wear out of them they so cheaply made they will come apart or rip."
1.0,I LOVE THE COLOR. THE MATERIAL WAS OF GOOD QUALITY. HOWEVER THE FIT WAS JUST OFF. THE PANTS WERE SLOUCHY AT THE LEGS LIKE THE PATTERN WAS OFF.  FIT WELL IN WAIST .
1.0,The back snapped off after being worn for a few hours
1.0,Doesn’t fit me well
1.0,"Color is wearing off after only a few weeks!!.. Yes I know it was cheap but seriously, this is not something I expected in such a short time."
1.0,"ordered these as a cute gift for my boyfriend, and it was perfect as I use ""love you a latte"" as my phrase. When they arrived, I just added the little bag to his bigger gift bag. When he opened the gifts, we found the item pair included key chains from two different sets. Only recourse is to return to Amazon and look for a last minute gift to take its place. What a disappointment :c"
1.0,"Unfortunately i received a fake persol sunglasses that not only looked fake but also used, the case they arrived wasnt even the original persol case it was made in Hong Kong and sunglasses didnt even had the persol sticker, very disappointed.<br />Thank you<br />Fernando Rodriguez"
1.0,It won't stay on. Cross falls through the opening. Bad design.
1.0,ordered l/xl received small
1.0,I just can't imagine who wrote the great reviews of this shirt!!! It's awful! It's very cheap almost see thru  and looks almost nothing like the picture...the leopard print is like a dingy grey tone...the  picture looks almost like a sweater and the shirt is cheap nylon...it's very cheap and horrible if it was worth my time I would  send it back but it will probably  cost me more so I will throw it in the trash
1.0,I returned this shirt because it was very small and you can see right through it. The collar is lined with the same fabric and the dots on the under layer show right through the shirt. translucent
1.0,"So bummed that this is SO small. My husband IS a bigger guy, but not massively so. 2x won't even go around his waist to be zipped.<br /><br />It does warm up very nicely and kept a good constant temp though."
1.0,"I'm returning this. I ordered the clutch in black, and in the picture here, clutch has gold color metallic zipper, but what I got has cheap looking black plastic Zipper. And the price now is just the same as the one from that infamous 'prime day' deal."
1.0,Stone popped out the minute I put it on my neck
1.0,Had to return because the size was supposted to be 10-11 and it would probably fit 7-8
1.0,"You get what you pay for, and a 2-for deal like this should have given me pause. They are far too lightweight. They do not stay on during a whole night, unless you adjust the straps to tourniquet-like levels. Light shines brightly through the nose areas. I guess these might be good on a plane or with use during other travel where you don't care if you lose them or not. Not recommended for daily use at home where sleep is most precious. Wish I could get a refund."
1.0,Beautiful pants just ran very large
1.0,Arms are cut small .. shirt is made weird
1.0,This dress makes me look chunky even though I'm 5'5 125lbs.
1.0,wished didn’t slide off ...
1.0,"Came in the wrong color and size, material is not cloth like the photos indicate either, it’s more of a water resistant feel. Doesn’t fit so cannot wear it."
1.0,"The fabric is horrible!  This cannot be cotton.  It is so thin and flimsy.  It’s very uncomfortable.<br /><br />I bought the pink plaid version, which was excellent quality.  This material is definitely inferior.<br /><br />Worthless."
1.0,i have never seen material like this is my life. tissue paper is stronger. it was awful!!
1.0,Cant get them looped on my ears
1.0,"A PANDORA BOX!<br /><br />I REALLY WANTED TO LIKED THESE BOOTS, RIGHT NOW WHERE I LIVE IS RAINING A LOT AND NEED THEM, BUT THEY MAY PROBABLY SURPRISE YOU! FOR GOOD OR FOR BAD! IN MY CASE WAS FOR BAD, SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU THE DETAILS:<br /><br />Pros<br />*good price<br />* Good material, inside and out ( i feel it soft inside for comfy and kind of sturdy outside for protection)<br />* look fashion ( i mean, they don't look huge and odd, but cute and wearable)<br />*and do their job, your foot don’t get wet!<br /><br />Cons<br />* Size! (The majority of people can face problem with it, due to the fact that they can fit  your calf and not your foot, or vice versa. Mine are tight in my calf, but have plenty of space that my foot doesn’t fill. i ordered a size 8, which is my regular size but they are big for my foot. Besacause of that and not able to wear them, i dont know if it is something that i have to take in consideration when buying boots, due to the fact these are my first one but im going to be more careful next time."
1.0,VERY CHEAP AND POORLY PUT TOGETHER...NOT LIKE PICTURE....I HAD TO RETURN IT!!!
1.0,"I ordered this same necklace for my husband for Christmas.  I then ordered again just repeated the order for my brother in law for his birthday.  However, what came was some type of bracelet.  He opened and I was very embarassed as it was not only a bracelet but a womans and it had some kind of linkage attached to it."
1.0,"This is way too short. Too long to be shirt, but not even long enough to cover my hips. Wasn't sure about this purchase due to the mixed reviews. Accidently bought from the seller JERC instead of Romwe - huge mistake. Romwe's sizing would've fit based off of their chart, and reviewers close to my height said this was long enough on them. The knockoff version would've only been long enough on someone under 5' - I'm 5'5&#34;."
1.0,"This is so cheap, it feels like all the rose gold pieces are plastic. It's hard to use the clasp, and if you set it big enough to use the elastic stretch it has, then its too loose on your wrist. Def not worth the price."
1.0,It broke when I put it on. Total fail. Do not buy.
1.0,Not long like the picture shows it to be. Returned it.
1.0,"Way too short. Fit around me, but it was short like it was made for child. Couldn't even get it up to tie."
1.0,Belt broke a month after purchase
1.0,Did not like the way they fit
1.0,"the word ""good"" on the pin only shows half way thru. it didn't make it all the way. `"
1.0,It seems that a lot of clothing coming from abroad sources think S in US is XXL.  I will be returning.
1.0,"See through, doesn’t look like picture, there aren’t holes for the buttons to go through either and very large"
1.0,"Having read a number of reviews, I discovered that a there seem to be different versions of this dress out there.  There is a version that is as advertised: a flattering, flowing, fitted, below the knee dress that you can wear all year long, dressing up or down as needed---or what I got--- a dress with extremely thin/quasi transparent fabric that really shouldn't be worn in public.  I tried it on, and while it fit as expected (XX black), it clung to my legs instead of hanging around them--not because it was tight, but because that seemed to be what the fabric wanted to do-- and you could see my underwear and bra through it.  I'm keeping it, because I can't be bothered to take the time and effort to send it back during a pandemic (I am high risk, and almost never leave my house.).  I guess it can be my housekeeping dress--- or if I ever go back to the Middle East, I could wear it under an abaya. I had originally ordered two of these--- happily, the other one didn't arrive due to an unspecified delivery problem.  I got a refund for that one---  It really is too bad it didn't work!  One can never go wrong with a basic black dress---unless it is this one!"
1.0,Dress did not arrive as pictured. It looks like a cheaply made slip.
1.0,"I don't understand why plus size underwear is never actually made for plus size people. If your mons pubis is prominent at all, forget these."
1.0,short...
1.0,"I bought this one to my wife as Christmas gift,  the bad quality of this , I tried to return directly to Malanda Jewelry and no answer that all. She has to throw it away.  Rubbish"
1.0,"Fatigan demasiado los ojos supuestamente son para hacer ejercicios , demasiado malas"
1.0,dress doesn't look at all like photo ... strips are in even and off material and stitching is cheap and when I tried to return it no one helped me.
1.0,"Ive been wearing Wigwam Super 60 socks for years. Received these socks as a birthday gift. (being an adult is stupid)<br /><br />These are not real Super 60s. They are mostly perfectly fine socks, just not the same design or comfort that I expect from Wigwam.<br /><br />These socks are WAY thicker, and longer than true Wigwam Super 60 crew socks. Also there is no side vent nor is there a brand logo across the toes.<br /><br />Again, they work as socks, but dont expect the same quality, design, or fit as other Super 60s."
1.0,The sole detached very quickly
1.0,Runs small and uncomfortable. I also I didn't like the style in person.
1.0,Size was not right
1.0,Do not buy this dress. Not as nice looking in person as in the pictures. Wore it once and the stars all flaked off. Going in the trash! Waste of money
1.0,This hat came crushed. It's a mess! I decided to return it.
1.0,"The shoes fit perfectly. And were very comfortable. But broke after one night. And not just broke, snapped in half.  I tried emailing through their website think they might have been defective. But the email bounced back. I wanted to buy so many more of their shoes. But will be unlikely to do so."
1.0,Size is not what it says more like a infant size
1.0,"During setup process a very loud siren came out of the device and kept getting louder. We got panicked, children got startled covering their ears - could have caused a hearing loss! I'm not sure what they put in this device but this is not even for adult safety approved device! I'm still shaking as I'm writing this review! BE AWARE, this manufacturer could be sued!"
1.0,The item was way too small. I even bought it two sizes bigger than what I wear because of the reviews. A waste of money.
1.0,after a couple washes the sleeves got baggy and dingy looking.  threads started coming loose also.  have bought others that work better.  wanted to get a hold of seller but couldn't find the link
1.0,I ordered two of these necklaces-one arrived but the other did not  I also was very disappointed in the necklce that did come-it is so small it would not fit a five year old. I want a refund on both necklaces burt I do not have but one to return. Please help Thank you
1.0,gave me dermatitis.
1.0,Super cheap and smells strongly of plastic. Stuff too. No way
1.0,"The quality of this top is just awful and I'm so sorry I was to busy to return it and the window closed. It didn't cost much but it really would be to make a point.  I'll never wear it and It's such a pity because it's a lovely color and cut. But oh, the itchy scratchy, see-through fabric! It looks way below even Family Dollar quality."
1.0,"Junky. After 1 wear, wash, & dry they were smaller and balled up. After 1 wear outside they were dark grey on the bottom and even with bleach they didn’t get white."
1.0,"Feels cheap, itchy and runs big. I tried to return it but could not. I am really disappointed with this dress."
1.0,"Had these for 2 weeks when a stone fell out. They are useless, now."
1.0,"I loved how it looked online. but when it got to me, i expected it to be cheap but not this bad. I opened the shirt and the leopard fabric between the black front seem frayed immediately. I can fix it but I shouldn't have to. it also took a month to drop ship, which is was drop shipped to me from Sammydress.com where it is even cheaper than on here. I wasn't expecting outstanding workmanship or something but before I even try it on it breaks? C'mon naw."
1.0,The board did not have the correct numerical order and it was missing stickers of running backs they had duplicate stickers and no blanks
1.0,"These gloves are really tight and not especially soft. They came oddly packaged in a vacuum pack, with each set of gloves individually wrapped (yay for more plastic), and when opened they smell awful!"
1.0,"i thought based on the reviews i was going to get a great pair of slippers for my daughter. bought her a size 8-9 and they seriously fit my size 6 foot perfectly. now she's left without a pair of slippers. hate to return them since i live out in a rural area. didnt want to go through the hassle. if you do decide to purchase, make sure you go a size or two up."
1.0,"Ordered two sizes up, still looked like it would fit a grade school girl."
1.0,"This item was horrible, it came in a ziplock bag and my 8 yr old granddaughter could fit it, that’s how small it was."
1.0,"Bought this product 5 years ago and the collars we great with great fit. Bought a few more today and found out the collars are too flimsy and too broad. Polos are supposed to have rigid collars. Material for the body on the other hand has become thinner than what they used to be. Manufacturer should've stick with the old choice of materials. Could've bought for my crews as their uniforms but because of the ""redesign"", I've changed my mind."
1.0,Received two &#34;Be Frie&#34; halves instead of 1 and 1. Won't be able to use this as a gift.
1.0,This is second time I have sent this review.  Received wrong color
1.0,What a horrible dress! Its MASSIVE and heavy. The neck hole was so small and I had to squeeze my head though it. If you have any shape to your body then DONT order this dress. Hands down the worst dress I have ever tried on.
1.0,Material not adequate for winter gloves; very thin material. The touchscreen fingers do not work. Returning these asap
1.0,Would have liked it had it fit
1.0,"Way different than the picture, really cheap looking, different color and charm. Thought I was ordering something small and cute for a friend, ended up with something so bad I don’t even feel like it worth giving it out as a gift....disappointed to say the least. 🤦🏻‍♀️"
1.0,"Absolute horrible hot mess!!!! I don't even need to write a written review!! The pics speak for themself!! The sellar should be ashamed of themselves for selling such garbage!<br /><br />Thin, cutting is uneven both on top and the bottom, it is not teal like the pic shows (although that's not the sellers fault), it has no sewn seam which would offer additional snugness so that it stays up!!!<br /><br />This thing is loose and falls from my face! I am definitely throwing it in the trash if I cannot return it!!!"
1.0,Straps across chest aren't comfortable
1.0,Pin were not very retentive appear made from poor quality material
1.0,very weird fit.  way to big in some places and to small in others
1.0,"""leather watch strap""......ha.  If there is any leather on this strap, it's the paper-thin inside layer of the band.  It looks nice, it may appear to be leather, but of course it is not.  It will probably start peeling off layers in a couple months.  I guess they figured if they charged enough money, people would believe that it was leather.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I'm not knocking the gloves as a whole, they were warm and did the job. Unfortunately, I am allergic to latex, try as I might to stay away from latex products, it is often found in these products, and many companies don't think to notate that there may be latex in products. I found out the hard way when my hands broke out on only the points the gloves touched. If you have skin sensitivities, stay away from these. I haven't had an issue in 15 years up until these gloves. Disappointed to say the least. I gave them to a friend who does not have these issues. Thankfully she loves them!"
1.0,"When I bought these the reviews were so much better. I bought these for my wedding day. Stuck like a champ but absolutely NO SUPPORT OR ANYTHING. I’m a D cup, Not meant for anything above a B cup (I’d imagine, or even above an A cup) I was so disappointed... but.. all I had. So, saggy girls for my wedding day."
1.0,Runs really small. Large fits like a small.
1.0,Fits too loose and it's just plain cheap looking and feeling. I didn't keep it.
1.0,THESE ARE NOT POLARIZED. THE LISTING IS FALSE. DO NOT BUY IF LOOKING FOR POLARIZED SUNGLASSES.
1.0,I wanted these Mask for my kids but they were too big.
1.0,waste of money. do not buy. it doesn't even wrap around because its so small
1.0,Recieved this today went out to dinner put my iphone and my CC's in it so I wouldn't have to carry a purse and it broke before I got home and my purses never break not happy with this item one little bit would not recommend it to anyone at this point
1.0,Zipper broke on second wear. And return time limit is over.
1.0,"They are cute in theory, but they were supposed to arrive in March and I just got them a few days ago. (It’s June 12th) plus they are heavy and poorly packaged. The metal of the hook was bent and the paint hat only 2 white dots. (They weren’t even on the right spots)<br />Couldn’t get a refund on these.<br />Would NOT recommend these.<br />:("
1.0,Really small for actual size
1.0,Sizes are not what they say they are
1.0,"The only thing that would make this dress appropriate is an extra 12 inches of fabric. I'm 5'8&#34; and I prefer to be able to sit and bend and walk without worrying that I'm going to flash  my personal business for the entire world to see. Does NOT match description. Does NOT match other reviewer images. I'm pretty sure it's also not a cotton/spandex blend as advertised, but  as it comes with neither a tag inside to explain care and materials nor any accompanying label to do so, I'll never know.<br /><br />This is going back with extreme prejudice against the item and the seller. Ridiculous."
1.0,"Bad packaging, way too small in size. No margin to expand the kurta. Too long and big chudidar. It will be helpful if chudidar is of cotton."
1.0,I had to buy a new pair of googles because this one is horrible. It leaks and clouds fast!! So annoying!
1.0,"I was really excited to receive these, but I can not recommend them. They didn’t even make it to my feet. One of the strap pulls came off just opening the straps up for the first time to try them on.<br /><br />The glue is visible on the sole seams and very messy.<br /><br />If you’re thinking these are a sturdy replacement for Teva or Chaco, think again."
1.0,Very cheap both the ball and racquet came off. I don’t even know where it is after having it only for 2 months. Waist of money.
1.0,Though these are adorable the issue with them is ridiculous. I went to wear these for the first time today and noticed my vision was off on one eye. Took them off and noticed 1 lense was installed backward. They are concave so while one is in properly with the curved part facing out as it should be the other is backward (rounded part facing your actual eye) so you cannot see right (like in a fishbowl on one side). Others can also see it when looking at them on your face per my husband. I really do like the look and fit of these and hate that I would have to return and reorder so I may just toss. For whatever reason sellers on Amazon rarely just replace something. Not even sure if this was a one off mistake so reorder could be frustrating. Seems like better quality control is needed as this is a really dumb mistake.
1.0,sooooo desapointed.<br />quality 0<br />didn't even worth to sent it back.. Returning label cost was 75% of the dress's price<br />it's in the garbage .
1.0,"Fabric was horrible. Way too ""heavy"" - not breathable. Returned it!"
1.0,I ordered the pink mirror aviators.<br /><br />See the picture and it will explain it all.
1.0,broke with in one day
1.0,The quality of this shirt is very poor and its just sewn together weird. I have requested a refund/return 2 times and had no response.
1.0,"This hat is a lot smaller than it looks in the photos. Tight around the forehead, and not a lot of excess loose material."
1.0,This product has a very poor quality. Using 2 times and two ribs of the umbrella became bent.  I do not recommend this.
1.0,They were way to small. I ordered a size larger because of all the bad reviews and they were still too small. Couldn’t even get my legs in them. They really need to update their sizing information because that’s ridiculous and a huge waste of time.
1.0,The socks came in smaller sizes than what was actually ordered.  The ones that were a match were sometimes not the same length.  Only about 11 pairs were pairs my daughter could actually wear.  I’d give zero stars if I could.
1.0,"Really thin poor quality fabric. Not a good buy, I'd recommend passing on this one. The picture looks much better than the actual product."
1.0,"The size chart puts the bust, waist, and hip all at the same measurement. I purchased the XL assuming that to be true, and when it came I couldn't even get it past my thighs. Returned."
1.0,Did not like the fit at the heal or the footbed.
1.0,"This item is not sterling silver, is not gold plated, is not 18k. I don't even think this is a metal. It bent almost immediately, the &#34;coating&#34; has bubbles in it, it is NOT stamped with anything. It is very poorly made. I would not ever buy this again, and all I wanted it for was the band to replace my lost wedding band. I won't even wear the band with my real wedding ring this is so horrible. Don't waste your time or money on this."
1.0,This runs SOO small. I ordered an XXL based on reviews..what a joke. This shirt was more like a medium.
1.0,Bad purchase.  I could have used a belt from a jacket.
1.0,Is too small. I order the large based on the reviews and fits like a small
1.0,In what world do these look similar!!?! I wish I read the reviews before because I would NOT have purchased them!!!
1.0,To small sending back
1.0,Way too big.  Make sure you order down a size shoes run Big!!!
1.0,"Llegaron negros, no quiero imaginar si los hubiese usado."
1.0,"not soft. the three outfits are made differently? one with a large button at top, not ideal for comfort. and they are not comfy. wish i could return but i missed the window. will donate. also, no need for sleeve hand mitten foldovers when its a size 2t???? just very weird."
1.0,Disappointed that the description says for clip on earrings but it is for piecred and I am unable to enjoy them.
1.0,"This thing did not stand up to a day of use. It's cheaply made and didn't even turn on. I don't take one star reviews lightly, so this is pretty bad."
1.0,I hate this chain I have purchased 2 of them and both of them have popped in les than 30 days of wearing them I Do NOT recommend
1.0,Don’t work any better than hunting socks
1.0,"This material is very thin and the dress was very small. I am 5’6, 150lbs. I ordered an 8 and it could barely wrap around my chest."
1.0,These are poorly made.. only lasted a month before the bottom started tearing!! And the lunchbox doesn’t fit anything in it...
1.0,Too small amd material really cheap
1.0,It hurts when you were there
1.0,Was not able to try on to small
1.0,Very cheap product. I took the gold pair out of the bag and the backing fell right out. I will have to superglue them just to wear them. Save your money.
1.0,This dress looks nothing like advertised. It is basically a potato sack with a pixilated flower print. It is also huge for the size it is supposed to be. DO NOT BUY
1.0,I bought this to wear to a brunch at a family event for Christmas Day. I wanted comfort over anything else and it was ver comfortable. I just don’t like the material that it’s made from. I did read the reviews and figured out it wasn’t cotton but thought I’d be ok with but just wasn’t. It washes pretty well too.
1.0,"It did nothing for my waist, it not worth your money."
1.0,Didn't last long the strap popped off in the 1 week of her wearing it
1.0,Not exactly the typical nice backpack.
1.0,"The lenses are not transparent as expected for all eyewear.  They are noticeably reflective on the inside so there is lots of glare.  This should be illegal because it makes driving very dangerous while using them.  I wrote a previous review for this same product and the vendor simply discontinued that Amazon product and established a new one, complete with 5 star reviews."
1.0,False advertising not 100% cotton!
1.0,Washed and it came out with holes in it! Very cheap
1.0,"Pros: very nice looking jacket, fits well and is a nice design.<br /><br />Cons: I ordered it in black and they sent me navy blue. Big disappointment, my work uniform needs to be a plain black jacket. Second week of normal wear and only washing once and air drying a big stitching tear on the armpit seam. I know tailoring so it’s an easy fix in the seam , but if I were an ordinary fellow with no experience in sewing, I would be upset. Too expensive for mishaps like wrong color and a busted seam."
1.0,First of all it doesn’t fit at all. It’s too big with extra links and then when you take them off it’s way too tight. It leaves marks it’s so tight. Secondly it has been over a month and I still haven’t received my refund. Super disappointed and never buying again.
1.0,Bad experience.  Our purchase does not appear to be completely nickel free and caused a terrible reaction.
1.0,This is not a coat. It's should not be classified that way. Itmore of a robe 😝False advetiment
1.0,"Did not receive the glasses I ordered. The glasses I received look like Harry Potter glasses. Frame is 2 big circles, black frame, and they are NOT blue light glasses."
1.0,Low quality. Stone was differently colored. Over all very dissatisfied.
1.0,"These sweaters were a great disappointment.  The fabric was nothing like Cashmere, course and scratchy.  The size I ordered was XL as I like a loose fit, it was too tight even with the larger size.  Cheap and cheerful.  The colors were the only good thing about them.  I returned them and bought something more expensive"
1.0,It came with a missing part. A crucial missing part bc the part missing won’t allow the band to connect with the watch. The metal connector didn’t come on one of the bands and the bands seemed really slim too. More feminine.
1.0,Shirt  was unwearable  after  one  wash  and I wash everything in cold  water.  I  have 4 other  shirts  from  this company  two still fit  after  washing  and drying  and two do not  .
1.0,"Very, very, very cheap. Granted you just know they're going to cheap, but this cheap? Wow. Two flowers popped off after about a minute of being worn. One lost a flower when being taken out of the plastic bag they’re in. I wouldn't order these again if they were free. I'd be embarrassed to give these to anyone as a gift. Save up 12 shoeboxes. Your child will have more fun with those on their feet then these good-for-nothing things. Ordered these on August 4th. They were all broken and in the trash within 2 months (and that’s being generous). Let your child flush some money down the toilet. That will be infinitely more fun than these atrocious things."
1.0,Worn once and the insert already came out. They are cheaply made.
1.0,"The strap came, but the mat was missing. When will I get what I paid for????"
1.0,The zipper broke the first day he wore it
1.0,"So so small,"
1.0,I hated this.<br />Poor quality.
1.0,This is for a newborn baby.
1.0,This is junk it arrived broke in five pieces i couldnt even glue this mess back together and put it on my puppy.garbage....!!!
1.0,"This bathing suit was super cute but it ran very small. I tried to return it for a bigger size and the reply I got from the seller was, &#34;can you try to wear it or give it as a gift to someone because we will only refund you 30%&#34;. I was absolutely blown away because I had never received such horrible customer service. Especially after I had said I loved it and was gonna order the large. Not anymore!!! Clearly if I wanted to give it as a gift I wouldn't have bought it for myself. So disrespectful."
1.0,Didn't fit. A large is like a junior's large not a 'woman large'. Disappointing.
1.0,$23 for two pieces of plastic and a rubber band!<br />Ridiculous I returned it immediately
1.0,These are ALL COTTON - which is nice if you like to Iron.  These should have been made out of Polyester or something easier to maintain.  Looks like a bed sheet wrapped around me.
1.0,The fit is like a kids fit.
1.0,"These things are awful. Difficult to put on, the material is scratchy. When it comes to compression socks, you get what you pay for and at $9.95 you get a lousy pair of compression socks.<br /><br />All the postive reviews tell me people haven't really ever had a GOOD pair of compression socks because if they did they wouldn't be postive about these nasty things."
1.0,"I received this product on 2/2/23 as soon as I tried it on and zipped up the sweater the zipper malfunctioned. Another thing you may notice is the pocket, that happened while pulling up the sweat pants. I had a whole look as you can see and now it’s all ruined."
1.0,Cheap quality fabric
1.0,For a XL can’t believe bottom is so Narrow! It’s not wide enough like other brands I buy!
1.0,First pair we got broke within 24 hours....contacted Amazon and got it replaced & now the replacement pair has broken.
1.0,extremely too small
1.0,Super thin material and was WAY too small.
1.0,cant figure to use it...I wasn t wable to use the purpose
1.0,Looks cheap and fits odd.
1.0,"This jacket was bought as a gift for my son. After seeing him wear it some time later, I realized the jacket was so far off on shoulder placement that I attempted a return due to failed quality control. My request was refused due to time!  THE FACT THAT THEY PRODUCED A FAULTY PRODUCT AND MISSED IT MEANT NOTHING!<br />Don't get me started on their failed to produce a realistic distressed appearance."
1.0,Not what I was expecting too small waste of money!!
1.0,"I just bought this product and not worth the 18  dollars. the picture they use make the masks look full and beautiful. In fact, the fabric is cheap, the strap broke the same day I tried it on, In the picture, it shows the red mask with black straps, I got a red mask with white straps. I could have found better masks in the beauty suppy store.  dont' waste your money"
1.0,Not what I expected at all.  They look very plush and comfy in the picture.  They are not!  The slippers are very thin and uncomfortable.
1.0,This product was not what I thought I was getting First off a child couldn’t even fit this and there was no stretch nothing it is horrible it is not a scrunchy type of look or feel I can’t believe this and I received the wrong color don’t waste your money 💰
1.0,"Whalen this came it was very see through, which kinda defeats the purpose of buying it for summer, since you would have to wear something underneath. Also I ordered the grey one and it is definitely black. This is the first time I have been very disappointed with clothes I bought on amazon."
1.0,We could not keep the umbrella open. Two of us tried. It had only been used once before.
1.0,Cheap. It broke before I could even use it
1.0,"Disappointed. Looked good new. After first wash, all pockets sagged and looks very bad. Should have bought another line of gym shorts from Brokig which was good. Past return window. Hoping Brokig will address."
1.0,Only received 3 pair not what is shown in photo that I thought I was buying very disappointed
1.0,"We were not able to switch on this watch, total disappointment."
1.0,Fabric was super thin and cheap and it says 2X but it's more like a size medium
1.0,3X runs 2 sizes smaller. It actually felt like a XL. Ended up giving it as a gift.
1.0,"Very roomy, comfortable I just wish I ordered 1 size smaller"
1.0,These suck. They don't stay on my face unless pulled up over my ears and then they are hard to breath through. Not recommended.. Returning them.
1.0,"Way too small, and was not purple; more gray color"
1.0,"I didn’t like it, it was too small, it was cheaply made,"
1.0,"The fitment is horrible, mask sits wrong on my sister as it was a gift. Even for myself it fit too big. On top of that she probably only wore it 3x max and the eye patch clips keep falling out and the glue on the teeth came undone. It looked cool but not worth it."
1.0,The dress is very pretty but it runs very small. And it had a bad smell. Returning.
1.0,"Weird fit, very tight and not flowy at all like the picture shown. It has a wing like seam on the sides that is hidden on the models. Not flattering at all."
1.0,"I liked the skort, but only received one pair although ""2-Pack"" is stated in the description. I needed them for a trip and did not have time to return it."
1.0,"The bottom half is so small compared to the top half. Unevenly made. Poor quality. If you have the SLIGHTEST curves or non-stick legs, this won't be for you. I even went up a size and the only difference was the top portion changed size."
1.0,I bought the hat for the ball and the ball fell off the second day i wore it.
1.0,"This shirt is very nice as I was expecting. But, it is defected. There is a slit open on left sleeve means manufacturing fault."
1.0,No like them won't order them agin
1.0,Too large i reorder
1.0,"This came new, but stained with some weird black line on the front."
1.0,So I still haven't even gotten my earrings I don't know what's going on with the delivery but it's very frustrating<br />So I wish I could give this a 0 star only because I'm in my feelings of not having my beautiful earrings
1.0,I don’t like when a description and a photo does not match your item when you receive it that’s so disappointing. Compare the color of what they are advertising to the color of what I received. It is not a bomber jacket. It is paper thin and can be worn as a shirt or you can wear it in the spring as a light jacket.  The fabric is not good quality. Runs true to size. SMH on advertising
1.0,Dress was extremely thin and very oversized.
1.0,Dislike will not buy I want to return it wrong size
1.0,The plastic keeps falling out
1.0,This was literally a waste of money.  It doesn't grip to you and it's hard to hold in place or squeeze.
1.0,"It was a beautiful dress, but the sizing was ridiculous! I ordered up, either a 2X or 3X (can't remember now) the waist looked to be maybe a 8 or 10. The chest was way too big, the straps were bizarrely short, and the little shoulder straps that hang down were so small they wouldn't fit around my 14 year old sister's arms. Such a disappointment as the dress itself was gorgeous! Totally bummed that I had to return it."
1.0,Cheap super cheap
1.0,"Bad material, size way off"
1.0,Too small to my daughter
1.0,Too small and there isn't an option to return it
1.0,Was nice just didn’t fit righr
1.0,Has lead! &#34;Not for use in children&#34;
1.0,"Admittedly, my wrists are a bit wider than the average person's. But, I've never not been able to put on an adult watch until the fadelite. I'm accustomed to a slightly snug fit, or adding a link to a metal band for comfort, but I can barely even get the two sides of the fadelite to meet. I can't even begin to pull through to the first notch. Seriously, this is like a child size band. And, you'd think they'd put something about that somewhere in the marketing. But, all it ever says is that the band is ""unisex"". There needs to be a length indicator. Also, these are removable bands. Why doesn't Diesel make multiple lengths? So, so disappointed."
1.0,"Junk junk junk!!!! That's all there is to say... I received one lousy earring and even that was defective, missing a pearl and paint chipped off the earring, and the earring didn't close right, the 2 pieces wouldn't go together when attempting to put the earring on. I can't believe Amazon allows such Junk to be sold on their site. At one time you could trust you we're gonna receive working good quality items. That's not the case these days!"
1.0,"Es un engaño dice que es de plata 925 y no lo es, solo fantasía  , no deberían poner en el anuncio esa mentira"
1.0,"Poor quality material, ripped when putting it on.  I don’t have long nails and I didn’t forced to put it on. I ordered small which is a perfect fit.<br />I tried to put it on again this time it ripped by the leg. Definitely a waste of money"
1.0,Cheap and they break easily.
1.0,and not comfortable. I had flashbacks of childhood pulling up my tights all day long and being so itchy and uncomfortable. They have runs in them before coming out of package.<br />These would be ok for a base layer underneath something that no matter what would be much more decent looking. Waste of money. Waste of time.
1.0,One is broken immediately after taken out from the package
1.0,Did not come with cigarette holder.
1.0,Too large and unflattering. Fabric doesn’t look as nice as in the picture
1.0,"There are what looks like makeup stains on the back of the dress. I ordered a medium, this has to be an extra large, it is also completely see through will be returning<br />Would not recommend"
1.0,The material is very flimsy and it ran way too small. Poor quality!
1.0,Somewhere too small
1.0,The rinestones are very uncomfortable and flip ya if you cross yiur leggs and then uncross them the rinestones get caught and flip you like a rubber band and that hurts
1.0,Not quality watch<br />Ok for kids
1.0,The dress I ordered was the army green color. The dress I received was bright lime green. I waited a month to receive it and am very disappointed.
1.0,The band (green dye apparently) turned my wrist green the first time I wore it. So much so that it didn’t Initially wash off with soap and water.<br />Side note: I’ve purchased other inexpensive Apple Watch bands from amazon that have been great.
1.0,This bracelet came open twice in an hour and fell off my arm.  There is 3 clasps on the bracelet and all three failed !!! Cheap
1.0,"Llegó en un empaque dañado, gafas de muy baja calidad, desajustada y débiles, no me gustaron."
1.0,this fake lolololz
1.0,Horrible. Item arrived damaged.  Upon inspecting the clothing.  Saw strings and found the whole and bad stitching.  No quality control.<br /><br />My daughter was not able to wear it for the photos and match her elder sister.
1.0,Not thw greatest  material ! Dont waste your money ! Really snug on your face and very unComfortable  I wish i would shop around more !
1.0,Had to return did fit properly.
1.0,Poor seams
1.0,did not fit my legs
1.0,"Cheap. Not actual feathers, its a picture of feathers on a screen print. Bummer."
1.0,so so small!
1.0,It is not true to size mis leading better I buy from store not on line
1.0,These pants are barely pants. More like a longer Capri. They are comfortable. A linen fabric feel. But I did expect them to be a lil longer.
1.0,Too small and they shrink!
1.0,Bows looked cute on fotos but they are not all the same size. The Headband sizing is all wonky. Some are ok and some are waaay to big.
1.0,"I’ve had better quality toilet paper. To start with the material is flimsy and not comfy, but it was cute so I tried it out. I barely wore it once before a huge snag-turned-into-massive-hole happened. Had to go straight to the garbage...where it belongs."
1.0,These are cheap. Wearing a pair for the first time today and they are unraveling and will not stay above my knee to show above my boot. Disappointed
1.0,"I'm 5'5"" and the striped dress I bought hit me a few inches above the ankles. Not floor length like the picture shows. It was an awkward length. Too long to be a midi dress and too short to be a maxi."
1.0,Had to return. Ripped immediately
1.0,Came totally broken.<br />When I opened it one black stone was already fallen out.<br />This necklace has two chains. One chain was already broken.<br />A ring that holds the stones together was missing.<br /><br />Now I have the trouble sending it back and find a new one for today's party.<br />Even the dollar store has a better quality.
1.0,Never got the gift. Very cheaply made
1.0,These would have been perfect had they matched.
1.0,Seems ok I guess it is a watch band whose going to know still LAME. It has same dimensions as the real thing however and this could be becuase its brand new maybe but the materials look much different. Almost every Luminox watch and/or band I've bought off of the internet has been a fraud. Why should this be an exception. But theres always small differences and thats how you know you got the NY city sidewalk edition. Look at the emblem on the clasp or if your purchasing a watch the back of the watch. Obviously if your not an expert it helps to have something to compare it too that you know to be authentic.
1.0,"Poof material, large and baggy"
1.0,"This is a terrible product.  I knew the cufflinks wouldn't be great based on the price.  However, they have a very sharp edge that would actually gouge into my wood desk (first issue).  Secondly, after a week of having the links, one broke entirely.  I would advise against buying this product."
1.0,Not impressed the adhesive doesn’t stay we were very bummed
1.0,I was very disappointed that thjs didn’t look like the picture and I still had to pay for it.
1.0,Way too small. Even too small for my daughter who wears a medium. Looks so much better in the picture!
1.0,Not for winter riding. Very thin and hard wasted money
1.0,It's off white which I did not like.  And super short
1.0,Cups are hard. A hug will be a dead giveaway you're wearing a push up. I don't like it one bit. I'll return it. Cups run big if you insist on trying it.
1.0,I typically wear size 4-6 in most brands but I ordered a large based on other reviews. This dress was way too small. Fortunately I have a petite friend to pass my purchase mishaps along to.
1.0,Opened did not fit as I ordered correctly placed on and bottom of shirt only reached to midway of belly stomach ! VERY DISAPPOINTED AND DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT SHIRT ! I CANNOT RETURN DO TO STATEMENT NEEDS TO BE RETURNED IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING WHICH BECAME DAMAGED UPON OPENING ! AND NOW I HAVE PAID GOOD HARD EARNED MONEY AND AM OBVIOUSLY STUCK WITH AN ITEM THAT IS TOTALLY USELESS TO ME !
1.0,Received a crop top. Was supposed to be a normal shirt
1.0,Does not look like the picture. Very low under the arms. Could not be worn without a shirt under it. Do not buy!
1.0,Nice looking but very very small. The X Large is really a small or medium. I ordered other X larges and the fit perfect but had to give these away so disappointed i
1.0,"Big and gaudy, note even b a fake moonstone,"
1.0,Stones missing had to be glued on. This ring will likely be in the garbage soon.
1.0,I'm not really sure why but I reviewed this item three days ago and my review and pictures never got posted. Odd... I bought these bracelets thinking it would be cute since my significant other works overseas. The male bracelet looks more masculine on line than in person so I didn't really care for it when it came in but he said he'd wear it anyways. In the first 12 hours mine was very scratched up during routine daily activities off work. Then we discovered my significant others bracelet had also been scratched up. If it scratched up this bad off work I can only how bad it would be at work. They were a waste of money that will be sitting in a box from now on.
1.0,It's imitation leather and more of an orange color
1.0,"Returned, too tight!"
1.0,Not worth the price if they are &#34;polarized&#34; you wouldn't be able to tell because the lenses throw off some weird colors switch mess with you vison and my possibly be bad on your eyes. I would highly recommend either pay sixty dollars extra and get (real) oakley lenses or if you don't wanna do that do without sunglasses you'll be better off then looking through these things..  Not even worth a star.
1.0,Extremely small for the advertised size.
1.0,Tiny slippers. Child size.
1.0,"cheap material, scratchy, fits awkwardly"
1.0,Not a good fit at all NO Support for top heavy women
1.0,when I ordered this as a gift for my daughters boyfriend the description and picture was of a flex fit hat aka a stretch fitted hat instead I got a crappy Velcro hat seriously
1.0,The material is hot it fit me ugly
1.0,Pretty but turning finger green first day
1.0,Broke when I put it in.<br />Seems the pole part wasn’t glued in properly. Disappointed.
1.0,"It was delivered to an address in San Francisco and not in NY state. After several tortuous massages, we get a coupon we don't want."
1.0,it is simply too cheap to wear... such a shame... it looks like plastic and it looks like it could fall apart at any second. please don't waste ur money
1.0,"Seams were not stitched well, very lopsided...I bought a large and I'm about 5'8 and 155 and it was very small and tight and awkward on me."
1.0,"i tried several times to contact company for return when they sent underwear instead of a robe. No replies, and now the time has expired. So, I have a pair of undies for the price of the robe! Not happy!"
1.0,Item came damaged. Also the material is nothing like the photos
1.0,It was too small for me. Had to return
1.0,Not recommend!!!!
1.0,"nope, not the quality i expected"
1.0,Zipper broke after 10 minutes
1.0,Tarnishes quickly. The clasps got loose after about a month and its fallen off a couple times.
1.0,"If it were not made for a person 4 feet tall and size zero, despite being a size XL- it would be cute.  It is way off on size chart!!!!!  Tiny!"
1.0,Quick to break
1.0,Save your money... looks like 1/2 of a glass marble that has been painted. Not what I expected.
1.0,Its tooo big. Go a size smaller
1.0,Super cute but broke within weeks.
1.0,This s*** is very misreprentsented and ugly.  Besides being way too small it did not look like the shirt I ordered.  Fabric was raggy also.
1.0,Received this as a Christmas present and sole is already separating. I always separate the slipper from my foot by placing my finger inside along the side of the slipper - not by using my palm on the heel or placing my other foot on the heel. Very disappointing.
1.0,don't waste money
1.0,"One star is too many.  The soles on these shoes did NOT hold up at all.  I bought these for my son to wear exclusively for running during a 6 week  track season.  The tread wore off in 3 weeks, by 4 weeks, the bottom of the sole wore all the way through to the airbag.  They didn't even make it ONE season.  I would never, ever buy these shoes again- why are these pricey shoes made so poorly they can't hold up?"
1.0,To Small. I also have to pay to return for a different size.
1.0,Looks great but unfortunately broke on the third time using it!
1.0,These photos advertised the rings to be shinier than what they are. I'm extremely disappointed.
1.0,The band on this ring is so thin that it is uncomfortable to wear. Much thinner than it looks from the picture.  Otherwise it's an ok ring. Ruby is pretty murky with many many inclusions.
1.0,I ordered a men's size nine based on the advertisement instructions.  What  I received  was closer to a size 6 women's shoe.  Could not get my foot to began to enter the shoe.
1.0,This earrings did not look like the picture. Look cheap
1.0,Runs small and very thin!
1.0,"When i placed the order I wanted 3xl... but it was soo small when I got it it fit like a small or medium, and the zipper didn't work all that well either"
1.0,Not US sizing and size chart not clear. Was well beyond too small and was also too small for friend whose size is much smaller than mine. Was going to return it but shared it with someone else instead.q11
1.0,It broke fast.
1.0,Terrible quality. I bought the &#34;light blue&#34; color as well and they came as an aqua? Not as pictured.
1.0,Cheap quality wore once and it broke.
1.0,Did not look anything like photo.  Material is stretchy and poor quality

1.0,"Not worth the money spent, case busted first time used!"
1.0,"Horrible, does NOT fit ears at all. What. Waste of money"
1.0,For a 2X it was very small in the arms and chest.
1.0,Broke within minutes. And very cheap back part
1.0,"These arrived folded into an odd shape after who knows how many weeks bent up.  They will not form back to their original shape they need to be, so they collapse on to the lips as I use them.  Totally useless.<br /><br />They arrived smelling of chemicals, although this improved with a washing."
1.0,"This looked cool in the pictures but it is cheap as far as quality. After two days of wearing on a hike, the seems started to split. At the end of 5 days, it was completely falling apart. Waste of money. 0 quality."
1.0,"tried to order again in correct size, said you had it but when ordered came up as 5 again"
1.0,Belt came apart in almost no time.
1.0,"I sent mine back, plastic lenses, no V etched . Flimsy plastic frame.  Was very disappointed in the lack of quality..."
1.0,"Shiny Link Chain<br />not what I expected. Made like a chain, but not."
1.0,"size is very misleading, too bad, it's such a cute shirt."
1.0,Not made for xlarge woman
1.0,"Caution!---these are not adult size at all. I ordered 3 and all of them are for children--very small, will not fit on any size adult head. Sending them back. Falsely advertised"
1.0,"Ordered medium, way to large around the top. Didn't fit well and the material is inexpensive in my opinion."
1.0,"I got this watch through my other account. Was expecting a beautiful watch. It is indeed, but the dial was off center! the XII number was close ti the 1 o`clock position"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:7740549619466231916388129a8b1c69]] Poor quality/craftsmanship not true sizes..the lace tore as soon as I pulled it over my head better off shopping at Wal-Mart..
1.0,"-Material ultra thin and cheap.<br />-The stitching was uneaven on the left and right.<br />-Fits larger than specified.<br />-Returned the next day I got them<br />If you want just a shirt to go to the gym in and get nasty and sweaty, this could be an inexpensive alternative. Not good for casual use IMO."
1.0,Sizes run too small and is cheaply made garbage........
1.0,Very stiff plastic. Pretty much formed the way it is packed. I even tried a blow dryer to soften and shape with no luck.
1.0,Elastic caps suck
1.0,I was disappointed at the quality and I won't recommend these to anyone
1.0,"This is very thin material, can see right through. It runs big in size. Very scratch material, not soft at all even after three washes."
1.0,Too small and had a funny smell. I was able to get a refund after not wanting a larger size.
1.0,"Thus is the second time I tried to by a kimono,  I tried a 2 sizes larger sizes it is still to small."
1.0,"Returning the dress, the stitching in the front was done incorrectly, made the dress have a pocket look under the breast area. Looked awful! Very disappointed."
1.0,"Poor fit, fabric bad"
1.0,The sandals were two different heights. Not a good purchase. Very cheaply made. Don't buy them.
1.0,"I'm not even sure how to rate this as far as how it fits. The legs don't taper so it looks like a prison jumpsuit. There is so much fabric in the front toward the crotch, it almost feels like it's on backwards. I looks like you're wearing a diaper."
1.0,I got this 2 days ago.<br /><br />The belt rips out of the buckle way too easy. I've never had that issue before
1.0,These shoe horns cracked while using them to put on shoes. I would not buy them again.
1.0,The neck and long shoulder sleeve was very tight and uncomfortable. Returned it immediately.
1.0,Shirt came in and hole was in the seam about 2 inches wide. Sizing is very weird. It’s very wide but not very long.
1.0,The size is very small. so sad
1.0,"After 30 minutes of trying to fit the pins into the band, I decided to send it back. It would not work."
1.0,"I did not use them for anything.  They are in jewelry chest. Asked for ""large hoops"". Received the smallest i had ever seen. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Socks that arrived were not 'no show', but were rather more of a low cut that sits around the ankle.  Shows in vans/boat shoes/etc.  Returning."
1.0,I was shipped a used product. Pet hairs all over the fabric. The internal label even had fading from multiple washes.
1.0,Not much stretch for yoga pants
1.0,Too Small<br />Color not what expected
1.0,Don't think they are actually surgical steel seem really cheaply made. Too afraid to wear them.
1.0,Not good for big breasted women. I am a 34 DD and I was falling out of this size L top from every angle
1.0,So thin and flimsy. Wouldn’t even stay in my ears. Kept folding and falling out. What a waste
1.0,Battery would not charge.  Returned.
1.0,It was too small that I had end up giving it to my daughter and no one said it was a two piece they said dresses
1.0,I disliked the fit
1.0,"I've been using Accuratic watch winders for almost 20 years and currently have 4 in operation. This new design is far inferior to their previous design. The primary flaw is the weak attachment of the rotating drum to the motor. It's thin plastic and breaks frequently. I've gotten no more than 6 months out of a drum before it breaks, rendering the winder useless. Sometimes, like this purchase, the drum arrives broken! (see photo).<br /><br />Additionally, the ""sponge"" that you attach the watch to is not designed well. It does not compress, forcing you to use a filler piece to make the watch fit snugly (unless you have pencil thin wrists). If you happen to have a watch that utilizes side clasps to release the buckle, forget about it. The sides of the ""sponge"" raise past the band, meaning you need to squeeze your fingers between the sides to try to actuate the buckle release. (see photo) Also, removing the sponge/watch combo from the winder is tricky since there are no protruding tabs to grasp.<br /><br />Save you money and spend it on a different winder."
1.0,"I bought this tie for my father, but when I got it, it was half the size it said in the description. The description says it is about 60&#34; by 4&#34;, but I measured it and it was only about 30&#34; by 3&#34;. It was like they sent me the kids version of the tie. Also, the picture shows red, but it looks almost pink, and that won't do."
1.0,"Do Not Buy!!! That's the last time I buy an item based on 3 reviews. These glasses are so cheaply made. The lenses are just a flimsy, plastic film that moves when you slightly press your finger to it. If I was to even gently press on the plastic, it would break. Unbelievable. I paid less than this for glasses with much better quality."
1.0,"Dress is cute on but there is no support at all, plus material feels cheap and it's see through.. Plus if you have any bumps and lumps they will show. Price was good ,dress is cute but I'm going to have to to pass on this one. Oh yeah no spandex if you needed it like I do. This dress seems like if you were to sit for a minute in this dress your butt print would be there."
1.0,I did not get the correct item. Have to return and hopefully will get the right one.
1.0,"At first, while putting on the dress, I was so excited until I looked in the mirror.  I'm thin and wear a size 6, but the pockets bulge out at the hips, making one look much larger than they are."
1.0,The hoops are to small for my top ear and the post are to long...
1.0,"These are AWFUL. The stones are dull, flat and the color of swamp water. I actually had Amazon send me another pair (Still didn't look at the reviews, which was stupid) just in case it was a fluke. It wasn't.<br /><br />These are cheap and horrendous. Do not purchase!"
1.0,"Ordered the Fanning and they fit perfectly, but these were too small and had to return. Need to order at least 1/2 size bigger than normal."
1.0,"Only fits to size 10 US, not one size fits all."
1.0,Tassel was broken off shoe when I received these
1.0,Cheaply made and looks nothing like the picture or description!! Not satisfied at all!! Waste Of 34$
1.0,"Is not good it kills the battery of the watch, the magnets of the band drains the battery to last couple hours."
1.0,The earrings came with a missing diamond. I went to put them in my ear and the gauge was so wide and square that it was painful to fit it into my ear hole.  Furthermore the width of the part that wrapped around my ear was so small that it bent my ear and pinched it. I should mention I have smaller ears. Very poorly made and I will not order from this seller again as the earrings are not functional at all.
1.0,"This was sent to me to replace the first one I ordered which had one of the hearts missing.  This one had a heart (the same heart) missing.  Decided not to re-order.  The hearts look nice, but the chain doesn't look to be very good quality."
1.0,Dress did not look like the picture
1.0,"These are super cute, but the came completely apart after my very first wear. I do not recommend wasting your money."
1.0,This leotard was completely see-through.  My 9 year old might as well have been naked.
1.0,"Cheap material, cheap tailoring. Basically, it looks as cheap, so you get what you pay for."
1.0,very cheap material and no washing instructionns
1.0,I only received 3 out of the 6 and all 3 were falling apart and damaged.
1.0,It was so small no way it could’ve been 2x
1.0,One necklace mask holder came without a clasp to hold the mask on one side. Then another necklace mask holder broke on day 2. Definitely isn’t strong enough for an 8 year old.
1.0,"Horrible material, too synthetic"
1.0,"The color of the scarf is more of a bright blue, not dark teal like the description says. Returning the item."
1.0,"Minus 5 stars if I  could,  cheap,  isn't word for it. Something you used to get from 5 cent bubble gum machine."
1.0,This dress was so pretty but way smaller than the size chart suggests. I purchased based on my bust size as always and a large usually fits well. I don't think even an XL would have done the trick . I couldn't even close the wrap. Probably best for thin small busted figures.
1.0,Purchased this belt in May and it is almost completely torn in half!  Looked nice when I purchased it but poor quality!
1.0,I bought the salmon colored print. I ordered a large and it was too big.  The print in this color looks like a blood covered smock. I'll keep it and use it for Halloween.
1.0,"It’s see though! I know what ur thinking, it’s because of the holes, but nope! I put it on with a pair of leggings and the material was so cheap I could see them right through the fabric."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ac3cf0f36ad32b9685e4754326b14723]] The lens popped out and won’t go back in need a exchange or refund.
1.0,"I did not feel like this looked like the photo and was disappointed. It's also itchy. When I ordered the Shacket, it was prime. Now it is no longer prime, and I can't return it. I am very disappointed. I will not be purchasing from this seller in the future."
1.0,This is cut very strange. The bottom is very big and loose and the arms are tight and uncomfortable. This goes straight in the trash.
1.0,"This is a cute hat, but it for sure runs small. Also I think they call it a foldable hat so they can send it to you smashed up. It is lifeless... not even a steam is going to bring this hat back. Very disappointed"
1.0,I'm extremely disappointed. I wore it twice before washing it and loved it. One wash and the color faded to off white with random stains. Will not be buying another one to replace it because I don't want to risk it. I wore it to the gym and the bar.
1.0,Pocket placement awkward
1.0,It was beautiful when I got it than it changed color which indicates it is cheaply made
1.0,"I ordered several pair in different colors.  All the others fit nice and seemed to be of decent quality.  These pants are clearly different from the others and the material is much cheaper and thinner.  As soon as I went to put them on, there was a big hole in the material.  It’s definitely not fixable.  Cheap product - don’t waste your money."
1.0,Cheaply made. Unsatisfied with my purchase
1.0,"Wood is splintering, and whatever stain they used has left an orange funk on my ears. You can see where the stain is no longer on the plug. This is with daily wear after only 10 days. Junk!"
1.0,"This neck gator is a complete JOKE! Per the description... ""SUN PROTECTION MASK: Too hot to go outside in summer day? Don't worry, you can enjoy outdoor activities comfortably, as this face mask can protect you from the hot air and sunburn and keep you cool in the hot weather.""<br />That's a complete lie!! Our son has very fair skin & burns easy. So we always take extra precautions. I spent hours reading reviews & thought this would be the best one. He was out side for about 3 hours from 8am to 10am for football camp. As soon as he came home he was saying he didn't feel that great, sun burns make us sick. I honestly thought he never had the neck gator on after looking at him. However I confirmed with the coach in fact he did the whole time! We have used other ones all day with zero sun burn. This is completely unacceptable, very disappointing and upsetting. Our son has been up all night sick from this sun burn & will be missing the rest of football camp.<br />If you are purchasing this for sun protection DON'T DO IT!"
1.0,I gave it to my son because it was too small. This was not a 2X at all.
1.0,"Malísima calidad, dos puestas y ya perdieron el dorado"
1.0,"It took me over 6 weeks to get a refund issued from this seller.  When I opened the package, I could tell immediately it was cheaply made and it was also ill-fitting.  I requested a return.  The seller offered to replace the item.  I respectfully declined stating I just wanted to return the dress and receive a refund.  Again, they offered to replace the time and this went on for a few email exchanges.  I ended up writing a negative review and they responded that they would refund my money ONLY IF I took down my negative comments.  I then reported Clothfun to Amazon, but received not response to date from Amazon.  I continued to push Clothfun for my refund, so then they said they had no record of my return.  I sent them a copy of my mailing receipt.  Again, they requested that I remove my negative comment then they would issue a refund.  My favorite is the email that stated they would lose their job if I didn't.  So I took down my orignal negative review.  My refund has finally cleared and I'm here to warn other buyers about my terrible experience with this seller."
1.0,They fit terribly.
1.0,Not has expected
1.0,I wanted to love these earring so bad I've been dying for Earrings like this since Hilary Duff wore something similar but when they arrived they were TINY and they didn't even close I was so disappointed
1.0,Do not buy this bra. It makes your boobs look super pointed.  The sides keep the back fat in but it doesn't make your boobs look good at all.
1.0,I have not come across a pair of sock that were really seamless yet.<br />Stuck them back in a drawer
1.0,"Would give this product a 0 star rating if I could.  I bought the bag for a trip I was taking and 3 days in the lining ripped.  I had no choice but to use the bag for the remainder of the trip while it ripped all the way across.  I apparently cannot return the bag now, since it is no longer an option on my account.  I am very frustrated and now must throw away the bag.  What a waist of money."
1.0,They hurt my toes where they connect to. Very bad. Can not walk in and out of the shower at the gym with ease.<br />They are junk! Addias is the best in my opinion.
1.0,Don’t waste your time or money. It’s not real silver
1.0,"The hat itself looked like decent quality, but the logo looked cheaply made for the price and much smaller than expected."
1.0,"Disliked, too small for large size"
1.0,When it came it came all folded with a crease in the brim that won't come out. The strap came off right away like it had been cut. If could give zero I would.
1.0,Not good quality... left marks on skin within 24 hours wearing it...
1.0,Silver plated. It rubbed right off exposing as copper and turning finger green
1.0,Maybe did someone really skinny?
1.0,One earring lost all the gold color already and my daughter wore it for just two months. Disappointing because it looked nice on her.
1.0,Iron on patch. Save your money and upgrade to a better hat.
1.0,"Dangnabbit...the picture is spot on with what I thought I ordered (facepalm) what I received was one of those awfully cheap denim-like alternatives, where the coloring is there but not so much the material. This was promptly returned, and I do mean promptly."
1.0,"These are in a word: awful. Cheaply made, uncomfortable. They are going straight back. How they get 20 bucks for these is beyond me."
1.0,This is just junk. The headband ears arrived broke and the tail is about 6 inches long. Threw it right in the trash.
1.0,Was not the skirt pictured. I received a tan and white at the bottom skirt. Clearly not as advertised!!!!
1.0,"The product fits but the print on the bodice is upside down. I sent it back and received a new one and it's still upside down.  With some prints it doesn't matter but with a cactus print it does. I ordered a M, and was planning on ordering other dresses for summer but went with other brands since they don't do QA on theirs."
1.0,White plastic framing underneath bent the 1st time we used it and will no longer hold that part of the umbrella up.
1.0,I rarely write reviews but this product fell apart immediately in the first week. Buyer beware!!
1.0,I bought this shirt because of the image of the shirt in the picture.  Should have known better when there was only 1 written review.  Shirt was extremely small and seemed like it would fit a little girl or boy instead of a grown adult.  Also the length was extremely short.  Someone with no torso could probably fit in this.  I returned it.
1.0,"I purchased these and was very excited. I went to put them in and first was frustrated by the large diameter of the piercing, I have always used nose rings of larger diameter. But these were MUCH larger than normal. I was able to get it in with some patients. But within 24 hrs my name became extremely sensitive and began to have a reaction to the metal and began to swell. Would not recommend."
1.0,Awful quality ripped along the leg the first time and that's that I have very slim legs.
1.0,Infected my daughters ears she really wanted to wear them though cause she loves pigs but they were just very cheap and poorly made
1.0,Quality is pretty bad
1.0,Parecen solo un trozo de tela
1.0,They were spreading torn and sequins were falling off.  Bell had scratch marks in it.  Returning them!
1.0,All 3 headphones broke the first time we put the on at an NHRA drag race. The ear pads came right off the chincy wire connectors.  Thank God I brought 3 ear plugs.
1.0,The material looks very cheap.
1.0,The chain necklace was already discolored and I attempted to remove the pendant to put it on a better chain but the way it is designed prevents removal of the pendant so you're stuck with the chain. The discoloration ended up making the entire necklace look cheap so I was frustrated at not being able to remove the pendant.
1.0,Pay a little extra for better quality and beetle fit. This is not worth more the price you pay. Rums small
1.0,"The fit is so off, I'm going to give it to the kids to play with for Halloween or dress up, but the colors are amazing..."
1.0,It slipped
1.0,It says dress. Why am I only getting a blouse. Where is the tutu?
1.0,The watch cover is too small and doesn't fit properly and the band itself is small. Disappointing.
1.0,"Last year I ordered 2 pairs of these pants for my trip. I loved them, the material is soft and they are not snug fitting but comfortable. This year I'm going to China and decided to order 4 pairs, navy, black, stone and coral. All but the coral were knock offs. Different material, not stretchy and soft and the sizes were written in pen behind the material care label. I was so upset, I had to write this review. Original Velucci Capri pants like the coral I received as well as others previously bought, have the size embroidered in the Velucci label and have a small metal brand tag that states Velucci. I will not pay money to have fake knock offs. Though I am still wanting my black, navy and stone Capris. I do not trust the sellers. Beware of Knock offs."
1.0,The sides of the band kept falling out.  Poorly made.  Returned.
1.0,Finish chipped off item within a month
1.0,Don't buy hard to breathe in
1.0,The product arrived with holes. Not see through which is nice but still can’t wear them due to the holes. Cheap material but cute.
1.0,This would be soooo cute if it was for Women !<br />Absolutely did not fit I usually wear L so I up my size and Xl seems to a M or made for children!!
1.0,"Too small, option need to be displayed at the time of purchase."
1.0,"This item was not how it looks, it was short and not long enough to use as a scarf. It was more like a napkin in size, Shady!"
1.0,The jacket seems to be a discarded item since the stamps that are supposed to be on the elbows where placed wrong and they end up being almost on the inside of my arm.
1.0,These slippers have only been worn inside the house and the soles are peeling apart.
1.0,"Bought one of these rings over a year ago. Loved it, wore it a lot. It was comfortable & pretty. Loved pairing it with other rings. Thought I would buy 2 more to wear in a  stack. The 2 I received were different, much cheaper looking and not as comfortable.  Several of the chips fell out in a matter of weeks. Super disappointed."
1.0,"The shirt had no shape- just huge and boxy. The graphic on the shirt was a very thick layer of some white acrylic. The fabric was sub-par, very thin. I did not like this shirt when I saw it."
1.0,It does not fit the HuaWise Fitness tracker. It only has a hole on one side (see picture). That should be made clear in the description. I am disappointed.
1.0,"Looks okay, but I feel like I constantly have to adjust it. The biggest issue I had was that the dye from the shirt ran, which resulted in pink spots on my other clothes."
1.0,"First off, these run small... Very small... I wear a size 12 in nearly every shoe brand on the market.  So I purchased a size 12 and my heel is hanging off the back of these sandals.  These sandals are nearly 1"" shorter than any of my other size 12 sandals.  They are also incredibly stiff, so the portion that goes between your toes is very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Unfortunately I missed my return window, so I'm stuck with these things."
1.0,Thr picture defined the design as if it was embroidery and it is a very cheap iron on that is faded thoughout the design! Horrible
1.0,Not a good size chart. We're too small
1.0,Terrible cloth and horrible fit.  Do not get if you have any curves or are over a size 4.  Super disappointing.
1.0,Not what I thought it would look like or feel like very disappointed
1.0,"glasses came missing a piece.  (after taking two months to arrive, and then were the wrong ones and yet another month to get the right ones.)  goodr said sorry but couldn't send me the screw needed or even relay to me the right size and thread screw to fix the problem.  they look cool, but never really got to use them to get a full review in."
1.0,Flimsy. Breaks trying to put it on. I regret wasting my money.
1.0,I have had the bracelet for about 4 days and the string is in raveling. Would not recommend
1.0,This was not what I e pecked. It didn’t work at all.
1.0,"I purchased this and another very similar one from amazon and this one is much lower quality. It has a strong foul smell, the fabric is rough and cheap, and the cream color is more like yellow."
1.0,"Updated review- March 2017<br />Didnt last very long. The eyewear is starting to peel on both and whats odd is my husband has the 2nd pair and he hardly ever wore it and its peeling. Would not buy again and would not recommend. Added a picture of the peeling.<br /><br />This mask works great at keeping the light out, it does stay on my head good! I like that you get 2 masks and 2 ear plugs. My husband was able to enjoy the mask too. Only negative is that the strap gets on my ear when I'm sleeping and I wake up from it hurting. I think its because the strap is to thick. I wouldn't buy it again unless they fix the strap."
1.0,"Yes- they're cheap, but was hoping for more than one wear. Plus side, my daughter now uses the detached water bottle as a Barbie prop! :)"
1.0,The padding is so thin in these and it’s not that crushing at all. The top rolls down on me all the time and is uncomfortable. The fabric is like swimsuit material.
1.0,They dont fit my 5yr old. Keep coming off his nose. Useless unless they fit. Returning
1.0,Sleeves were tight.
1.0,"la tela muy fina,se ve todo para dentro y el size corre super raro dinero perdido no vale la pena"
1.0,"bought this for my wife for christmas, after a week of wearing it it broke in half. she did not even bend it to put it on."
1.0,Only worn the slippers in the house for about six weeks....the stitching across the front is already<br />coming apart.  Not good!
1.0,I got to carry on a trip just got it out today its a ex large I wear a medium and its too late to return very disapointed  it a very pretty suit but guess I'm gona give I t away no way can I wear it.
1.0,I'm usually a size L. So I bought an XL and it was still a little small. Washed it once and didn't survive the dryer. The design melted together.
1.0,"Very, very poor quality. Not as described."
1.0,it didn't fit properly and it was not sturdy at all
1.0,"Was tight in the forearms, baggy on my biceps and the folds of the front lay all different directions. Washing and ironing did not help w/ the fabric lying properly. Poor quality all the way around."
1.0,These socks are sized wrong. Too tight and too small. Will not recommend these to anyone. We are very disappointed.
1.0,The package arrived today... I was excite for it but found a hole at chest area. So disappointed... have to send it back!
1.0,These belts smell sooooo bad. Tried everything but they smell like the slow boat from China that delivered them. I had to throw them away
1.0,"Ring was smashed in - can’t even put it on. How you can package this and not notice is beyond me. It was not damaged during shipping, the box was far too large."
1.0,The product is too small.
1.0,The shirt material was heavy and the construction was mediocre.  I found the cut and fit unacceptable and returned them right away.
1.0,5xl is small in the USA this is rip off Chinese tactics is fraudulently advertised wrong zise is all a totally sucks is like a fleas Market made in Cuba with Russian support is demagogue no wonder Jeff Bessos is not the CEO
1.0,"Garbage.....everything that appears to be metal is plastic.  Unfortunate, I really liked the style of it."
1.0,These could fit a 5 yr old maybe.
1.0,"A ring Sizer should have one hook end up and one hook end down (i.e., opposites). This came with both hooks pointed in the same directions. I was trying to fit a small ring (few mm thick), and thought it might work, But I  could not get the hooks to hold. Finally I tried turning one end around and it snapped. Amazon helped me find another seller who has a double set which shows the 2 opposite ends as they should be. Amazon (Kammy) is sending them right away...I just LOVE amazon: products, service, quick responses, etc. I have prime and am willing to pay a bit more for it, although, obviously it's money...but for what they do, how they do it, and the products which they carry...phew. I live in a rural area and it's well worth having a service like this. I could probably live without the helicopters thought. LOL<br /><br />BUT do NOT buy this item. It is defective and will not work. I've un-done 2 of these sizers off old rings, so it's not as though I was &#34;playing&#34; or practicing.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY; DEFECTIVE."
1.0,It's seems used and quality is very bad
1.0,"This top was extremely small, when compared to others if the same size. Definitely did not fit. Will not purchase from them again. 0 stars but wouldn't let me, had to put 1."
1.0,This is NOT Tourmaline! It is plastic! I will be fileing a complaint for false advertising!
1.0,Do not buy. Bad material. The dress falling apart white trying to put on for the very first time. DON'T BUY THAT TRASH.
1.0,"wrong color and border stiching very uneven , looks childish work"
1.0,Came incredibly late with huge disappointment.<br />Super cheap material and unlike anything in the picture.<br />The color is more of a peach tone rather than brown (the color I ordered).<br />Please save your money and time
1.0,"No label(s) with required information : Fiber Content,  Country of Origin, Identification of Manufacturer, Importer, or Other Dealer"
1.0,"Thin, cheaply made. Only received 2 of 3 items"
1.0,"Couldn't even get this over my bum, I'm a size 16 and ordered the correct size, waste of $."
1.0,"This is trash. I'm a large in American sizing so I ordered the XL. It fit like a children's XL. The cups were MAYBE an ""A cup"" but probably not even that. Don't waste your money. Also takes too long to arrive."
1.0,They are very foggy... it is not Anti Fog by any mean. They fog up as soon as I get in the water. Pretty bad
1.0,The watch cannot detect finger touches through the protective screen. I was hitting the screen much harder than I would normally - and nothing. Waste of money and returning ASAP.
1.0,"I loved the sunglasses and the way they looked, and then they were sitting in my lap, I put a very light sweater over them, and the frame snapped. So frustrating -- they are definitely not sturdy.<br /><br />ADDING: I bought two pairs of these sunglasses. I finally took the other one out of the package this week to use them, and they also immediately snapped just from putting them on. In the exact same place as the other pair. So frustrating -- a total waste of money since I was able to wear each pair for only a couple of days before they broke."
1.0,"No zipper, not a good product. I requested return approval on 2/14/18 and have not heard. Poor customer service."
1.0,"Shoes showed up and I knew immediately the shoe was not what I expected. The heel is hard plastic and not rubber. Because the heal is hard plastic and not rubber I anticipate that the shoes will be a slipping hazard. The heal feels hollow and due to that, the shoe weighs next to nothing. The shoe feels totally cheap for the price that I was charged. I didn't even unbox both shoes.  i knew immediately I didn't want them, didn't even try the shoe on. They are going straight back to Amazon. So disappointed. I was very excited because the style is so cute."
1.0,Terrible quality.  Material is so thin and see through.  Looks and smells like it was previously worn
1.0,"Super cheap material and sleeves that are short , also the color’s and  off"
1.0,Made cheap. Was broken.
1.0,Not cute. Don’t fit the face well. They are very boxy.
1.0,Artículo no ha llegado
1.0,"I wanted to love these PJs, the print is cheeky and they have a smooth satiny material BUT they ripped after worn twice only (I bought up a size after reading reviews so it was very loose on me) . HORRIBLE quality fabric. :("
1.0,"Very cheap material, extremely thin fabric and the color was very different, what a disappointment ☹️"
1.0,"It is not worth it at all, I bought 4 of these for my daughter and her friends, the 4 were broken in few days , the locker does not close, it changes color immediately !! Major disappointment"
1.0,Very disappointed ran way too small but would cost me to send back so l gifted it on!
1.0,Sparkles wiped off immediately and after less than 5 mins of my daughter wearing them they were trash
1.0,"This dress is a mini, not a midi and the.knot was up way too high by the breast. Not flattering at all. Will.be returning."
1.0,Terrible broke after one day
1.0,didn't fit right on my boobs tight around arms and i had xl
1.0,"This product is marketed by stating that these socks are easy on, easy off. That is one of the reasons I bought this product. I wore them for a week and they are hard to put on & they are very hard to remove. They fit to tight. The size I ordered is L/XL I followed the instructions 1 thru 7 & before putting them on I put powder on my legs so it would make them easier to remove. They were hard to put on and very hard to remove. I got tired of fighting with them so I will be returning them for a refund.  Thank you  Michael Bellino"
1.0,Should have known better than order from a company that combines L and XL in one size.  The tops of the socks cut into my legs as if I was wearing a rubber band around them.  And there is a bit of difference depending on which color your order.  The black socks are way smaller than the gray and black socks for whatever reason.
1.0,Shoe arrived with lace loop not sewed in. We leave early Friday morning for a hiking trip.
1.0,Doesn't work... too small ... use almost 2 sizes more...
1.0,Cheaply made didn’t bother to wear
1.0,Had to send it back. Cute outfit but way toooooooo small.
1.0,"The attachment pins have 1/2 the extensio, pressure and pops out of the watch body."
1.0,This is a dollar store keychain at best.  Not worth the money. The size is very small as you can see by my photos.
1.0,loses its shape after a few uses
1.0,"These rings are advertised as sterling silver!! It is FAKE!!! Within 1 hour of wearing both my rings on my fingers turned green!! I ordered the letter T ring and the trex ring. It’s illegal to sell fake jewelry with stamps inside them, if they are FAKE!! HIGHLLY disappointed. Do not waste your money!!"
1.0,El reloj llego malo y lamentablemente me encuentro en otro pais desde donde es mas costoso devolver el producto.
1.0,"This item is not as advertised. It's so baggy and big, it pretty much a moo-moo. The large is one big burlap bag with itchy annoying linking that is very hot. This is a summer item, but the lining is irritable and hot! That doesn't make sense. The returns process is very cumbersome and complicated. I just lost my money on this one - buyer beware. There's nothing I can do with this, it's trash now."
1.0,"The necklace is beautiful. But, the lobster claw clasp didn't work. So, I couldn't wear it. I'm very disappointed. Because, I looked  forward to getting it. I am returning it."
1.0,It didn’t fit very well at the. The material was not as expected
1.0,Very weird fit on these. I returned them.
1.0,My son wore these once. The second time he put them in on one had already shorted out and only works when he walks on it.
1.0,Broke before I could even get it on
1.0,I would not wear this out as it is so thin like a pair of night pajamas and the sizing is off. More like loungewear for at home setting. 😡
1.0,This glasses came damaged. I waited so long to get it and received it yesterday. I would like a replacement. Really upset.
1.0,It did not fit the size. I was out of town and opened the item late . How can I get a refund ?
1.0,I do not recommend this shirt. The vinyl is so thick! I feel like I’m wearing a bullet proof vest.
1.0,I would of loved to return these two bags but I missed the deadline . The zipper was difficult to open didn't have a locking snap for the shoulder strap and no room for a kindle .the material was cheap and I would never buy again . I bought this for my trip to Belgium in May but will have to find another purse
1.0,"Hated that I purchased this band. The links eventually started coming apart out of nowhere. I wanted to like it, but you know"
1.0,Shirt was alot smaller than expected. I thought this was going to be tunic length and it is not. Requesting to return for refund.
1.0,Really not cute. Weird orange color and the print doesn’t even go around the back.
1.0,Very low quality. Pom pom fell off before even using
1.0,I’m 5’3 and 120lbs and this dress was enormous and definitely not flattering. It was so big that the neckline went below my bra. Returned.
1.0,Awful..go yo dollar tree
1.0,Waste of money. They are no improvement for night driving. Maybe they will work in fog.
1.0,Does not run true to size.  Runs very small.
1.0,"This appears to be like the really nice Murano glass jewelry because Lova swirled color and metal (gold?). However, these earrings are large and border on gaudy. They also have cheap plastic-like 'crystals' attached to the featured bead."
1.0,Ugly purple color.runs big. Im returning
1.0,"Sending back, would give zero stars if I could. Not at all as pictured, not even close to the same color. I figured that price for something cute was too good to be true but thought I’d just take a chance...will never do that again. Don’t buy this product."
1.0,Color seems uneven color of one earring completely turned color. Can’t wear uneven tone earrings
1.0,Talk about a short shirt. Not to mention doesn’t look like the picture.
1.0,Pulled the straps to tighten and they snapped in half! Cheap crap
1.0,The “caramel” color is actually orange; while it’s warm and comfortable there is no lining and resembles a bathrobe.
1.0,"Look, I get it...they're $10 sunglasses, so you shouldn't expect greatness. However, these things are awful. Horrible optics and seemingly all the reliability of toilet paper.<br /><br />Worst of all, they're so incredibly dark as to be rendered just about useless for normal usage. If you're welding, or catching the next solar eclipse, they might be useful."
1.0,When I reorder I expect to receive the identical product.  The second pair are an odd color that my wife will not let me wear in public.
1.0,"Poor quality and sizing. The stitching was coming apart within 24 hours, after only a few hours or wear. The size 4-6x isn't correct. The dress was snug on my 5t toddler. Pick another one"
1.0,Not cool!!! They look as pictured kind of but more awkwardly sewn and as if they fit a five year old... I wouldnt buy these again
1.0,When I wash and dry after too much shrink.<br />I don't  have bag but can you change size XL.<br />Thank you.
1.0,"Awesome looking, yes! But It literally didn't even last two hours before the red stone fell out and now is unwearable. Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money."
1.0,The product doesn’t fit Apple Watch se
1.0,Clasp VERY unreliable.
1.0,Only received 1 earring! Should have been a pair!!
1.0,Got these for my athlete at home. Absolutely no compression. Cheap. Thin. Keep looking.
1.0,The sizing is runs super small.
1.0,"First off, I bought the long and short dresses in the same pattern however, the long pattern is not the same as advertised. It looks much more childish in person while the shorter dress is exactly as advertised. I also ordered it in a large hoping it would cover my pregnant belly. Im typically a small/medium. The slit was wide open in the front. The shorter dress was purchased in a medium and it fits perfectly. Just weird in my opinion."
1.0,Do not buy this item! It’s nothing like what was described in the description. I’m so disappointed. I bought this flannel for myself for my birthday and this is what I received. It’s polyester and the brown tones are pink! Horrible.. I should of known better!
1.0,ALL man made material!!!
1.0,"Top was to big, I have DD chest size and still to big"
1.0,Cheap cheap material.  I wish I could give this a zero stars
1.0,"Horrible! Terrible quality, doesn’t help with condition and SUPER EXPENSIVE"
1.0,This should be obvious
1.0,Terrible- got one wear out of them before they got all balled up.
1.0,The crown didn’t bend and wouldn’t stay in the circle formed. It wasn’t a good buy.
1.0,Faded after the first wash.
1.0,Ordered a size larger than I normally need which is a a good thing. But extremely long for me and I’m 5”4 and see through. Plan on returning.
1.0,I JUST removed the tie from the package getting ready to go out and THIS is what I see! The pin is BROKEN!!!
1.0,Too small😭
1.0,I didn't like the dress. It didn't look good and it was too small. The material was bad as well. I will send it back.
1.0,"The gloves ripped the first day I put them on.  They may pass the legal definition of leather, but the gloves are more plastic than leather.  The deception was not a surprise when I learned they were made in China.  Amazon should be ashamed for promoting such poor quality on their site.  It is no surprise why people are learning they will get screwed when making purchases through Amazon.  It is no surprise why sales are down..."
1.0,Poor and sad
1.0,size is smaller than size listed.  considerably.  sent them back
1.0,"This was absolutely disappointing. I ordered this two weeks ago and it got here today. I opened up the plastic and a moldy smell immediately hit me. I touched the fabric and it felt damp and sticky. The color doesn’t look tan but more like a yellow brown. Returning it immediately, it was so gross I didn’t even want to put it on my body. Sad it didn’t work out. The item photo is deceiving if this is what it actually is supposed to be."
1.0,Material looks very cheap not as shown in the pic
1.0,Wayyyy too small. Can’t even get it over head and I’m only a small gal myself
1.0,"Crap, crap, crap.. this piece of crap disappointed my baby Christmas morning!"
1.0,"So disappointed.  I bought this for a hardsided suitcase that didn't lock anymore.  My friend and I each bought one.  We both had difficulty figuring out how to use it as the instructions were unclear.  I am usually good at figuring things out, so it took me a while but I finally did it, no thanks to the instructions.  Apparently, on the return flight, some knucklehead baggage handler used the strap to grab the heavy suitcase and it broke at the plastic cross piece.  I can't recommend this product."
1.0,Wasn't cute at all o didn't like
1.0,Has a weird fit to it. Not a fan.
1.0,Package was delivered at 3:22 pm<br />Its 8:30 pm and the shorts already have a rip in the seam
1.0,I bought this bracelet and one of the bracelet came darkened like rusted. Not worth my money!
1.0,I ordered a size XXL and what I recieved looked like it was meant for a child. My boyfriend who is normally a size 32' waist could barely fit in them himself. Worst purchase decision.
1.0,Just buy them from happy hour shades. Save yourself the disappointment they lasted a week
1.0,They brake really easy. Other than that they look beautiful.
1.0,I was so disappointed.  I ordered two of them.  Material has no give and feels very rough.  This is not something comfy and cozy.  I’ll be returning them.
1.0,Size was way off. I ordered a 2x and it fit like a small
1.0,Its not as it looks in thr photo .. i ordered XL anf its tok small like a medium !!!! The Logo is not the same !!!
1.0,"Ordered neon blue, received white"
1.0,Fabric came off the top after 2 days
1.0,"I got this before my band adapters arrived and the color is already rubbing off, revealing a copper color underneath. The color is rubbing off of the clasp as well as some of the links. The watch is only ever on my wrist or the charger.<br /><br />Would not recommend."
1.0,The arms are detached from the dress<br />Had to send it back<br />Also I should have gotten a smaller size It gathered on my back.
1.0,This product stinks. It did not fit nor come even close to fitting. The sizes must be off.  I would not buy this again.
1.0,Needle is worthless. Laces do not stay attached and it is far too big to fit through the holes. I tried for an hour and couldn't get this to work.
1.0,Broke before I even had the chance to try wearing it. It's more worth it to pay the extra money to get a better one. This one is just junk.
1.0,pretty but fit very oddly and very very short.
1.0,"This is a cheap material.. When I opened it, the stitching was all wrong and was stitched in bunches where yu could not read the U on U> S  or the ps on Corps.. I tried to fix it but was not use.. This is a piece of garbage do not waste your money on this product. I would give it a 0 if I could."
1.0,The proportions are very odd.<br />Too wide too short.<br />Material is sheer.
1.0,Not slip on’s
1.0,Arrived cracked.  Very thin material
1.0,Product size is WAY off.
1.0,Compression is to loose... doesn’t hug the body like most compression Tank tops do.
1.0,These just arrived... my kiddo hasn't seen them yet. So much for red hearts. If they fit and are warm we might still keep them otherwise getting returned.
1.0,Terrible sizing. Couldn’t even get this on my body and now the return window is closed so I can’t even return it.
1.0,The dress is too big. Ordered off size chart but there is an additional 8 inches for lace closure. It arrived in time but smells like fish. Read the reviews other reviews very carefully
1.0,Was so small I'm wondering if these sizes are Asian sizes.
1.0,Very wide even with tightening straps.<br />Arch was a bump…not soft.<br />Returned
1.0,You can’t see the logo.  It should be all over. The argyle part is useless.
1.0,"Very small,not long enough."
1.0,The sizing info is very wrong on this product. XL is to fit 42C and it was so small my chest didn’t even fit into it and overflowed everywhere!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED in this product. My 13 yr old daughter could barely wear these!!! Will not be purchasing these again.
1.0,"Very very dark, same shape as gascans, but, cheap hunk can't even see through them on the brightest day."
1.0,English must have very small feet
1.0,This is a poor quality product. The charm's edges are not &#34;clean&#34; and it is very cheaply made. It is about the same as the free jewelry that comes with children's books.  It is certainly not worth more than $3.00.  I've returned mine.
1.0,I didn’t get the right size in which I purchased
1.0,"These seem to be girl pants. No room for your genitals (really small inseam). Pockets are almost nonexistent, like girl pants."
1.0,Ill constructed--too small for this very petite little lady--
1.0,Lapis fell out on fone earring first time of wearing and I did not find it!
1.0,Loss of performance of drone. They wont allow the drone to reach over 35mph and with factory blades it reaches 47. Mavic 2. Wouldn't recommend other than aesthetic looks.
1.0,"I usually wear a size 12. Normally I would order a large in most pants or skirts, but since the rest of the feedback said to size up, I did and went xxl.  Still way too small.  There's no cheek coverage."
1.0,Didn't get the smaller one in package
1.0,Was broken upon delivery.
1.0,baaaaaad
1.0,"The dress was tiny, thin material and not the same style, it was the same fabric that’s all. The dress is completely different then what is shown"
1.0,I am a size 12 and i bought the XL. They are tight and fit like a size 10 (i am normally a 10 but the covid 20 got me). I held them up to my old ones and yep small.
1.0,The flap that holds the insert in the wallet broke within a few weeks.
1.0,Awful. Way too small and I ordered up!
1.0,I had this for less than 4 days and both pieces broke.
1.0,"This item is terrible. It looks absolutely nothing like the photo, I ordered two sizes bigger than I normally wear and it is still huge. This is such a scam and ripoff. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,"I bought these earrings for my second piercing in my ear and because they were white gold. Delivery was on time but when I got the earrings out of the box, they look like they had been made for a very small child. The posts are short and the backs are half the size of a normal earring back.<br />I put the earrings in anyway. When I woke up the next morning, my ears were red, inflamed and (for lack of a better term) crusty. I immediately took them out and cleaned my ears. I will not being wearing these again"
1.0,"I purchased two bracelets for my wife.  She loved them and was anxious to wear them to a meeting the same day we received them. Before she left she had to show me how nice the Tigers Eye looked on her wrist; however, she made it as far as the car and the bracelet literally broke and threw rocks all over the place. She is hesitant to wear the beautiful blue one. Hopefully it will be OK."
1.0,"I wanted cords for sunglasses - and looking at the photo I thought they were the ones with a larger opening for the larger arms of sun glasses.<br />But no, they were very small & although I can use them for my regular eyeglasses, the cord is very short.  So for me they didn't work out well."
1.0,"I ordered my size.  But, it was so small that I could not close and button it.  I'm very disappointed."
1.0,"Does not look as described, no where near the detail, cheap and half the clips weren't attached to the flowers. Ifor the price I would have expected them to at least be in one piece when they got here"
1.0,"Although super cute, they run VERY large. I ended up having to return them because they were literally a size a half too big."
1.0,This was way too small and looked like rubber. I unfortunately had to return.
1.0,"This dress is adorable, but my daughter only wore it once and there are now at least 7 holes in the dress. It is very cheaply made. I didn’t pay that much for it, so I guess my expectation shouldn’t be that high. Still, I noticed some small holes even upon arrival, and felt the need to warn others"
1.0,Run way to small. Not even close. Take way to long on shipping waited over a month for them!!
1.0,Cheap scratchy polyester with horribly cheap graphics
1.0,Wayyyyy too small!! Bought this in a 2X when I'm originally a Large and it was so tight and so short
1.0,"Bought the XXXL and im normally a XL and still to small.<br />Plus, the bottoms are only belly button high wasted, not totally high waisted."
1.0,I'm was sad to see that the headband was nothing like in the picture. It had a huge empty space in the middle and the seams did not connect right.
1.0,Small and doesn’t stay in place
1.0,No where in the description does it say that &#34;sister in law&#34; is also engraved in the bracelet as well. This ruins the whole effect of the bracelet. The name of the bracelet literally says best friend gift.  I just wasted my money on this.
1.0,It was very see through and very sorry
1.0,"Compre los shorts para un regalo, pedí la talla correcta y al cumpleañero no les quedo."
1.0,"The description is false. The entire product is only a foot long to the last hole on the collar. Would even fit a dog, let alone an actual person. My neck is only 14 inches and it's 2 inches too short to even fit. The product is false when it comes to advertising it's useable length. Avoid buying if your someone like me whose neck is bigger than 12 inches!"
1.0,"Does not fall 28&#34; from the shoulder; falls right below waist, doesn't even meet the top of my jeans."
1.0,This bathing suit is terrible! Don’t buy
1.0,"I had such high hopes for this romper. I love the pattern and the cut of the romper. Unfortunately, the first time I tried to put the romper on, one of the straps broke so I threw it away. It also doesn't really fit for short people. I'm 5 feet and it was way too long and and boxy on the hips."
1.0,Didn’t like. Poor material & fit.
1.0,"The mask was a flimsy latex, the eye holes were uneven, and the mask reeked of fish. Very disappointing."
1.0,These were much smaller than I thought they would be.
1.0,The sizing is off. The mask is printed felt and not plastic. Super cheap and not at all what is advertised.
1.0,"I did expect some sort of low quality product here, however, it was even worse. These do not stay closed."
1.0,Arrived without a chain and is garbage packaging.
1.0,Toe went straight thru sock around one wear
1.0,Sizing was terrible. Should not be advertised as adult/kids youth. If I could return it I would. Now I don’t have a shirt for my pregnancy reveal. :)
1.0,"If you have sensitive skin these are not for you , although they are super cute they irritated my nose so bad it got infected after just wearing then a couple hours . Not recommend"
1.0,Cheap cheap like dollar store fabric. Never buy
1.0,"Fell apart after a month ,junk"
1.0,I could buy out all the Tupperware at a Tupperwear party for this price🤡🌏
1.0,Noooooo!!! Just don’t!!! Cheap cheap cheap!!! Arm holes crazy big and low. Thin horrible material.
1.0,"So disappointed in this purchase.  Trying to decide if I will return it since I am still w/in the time period.  It is the 3rd backpack purchased this school year for my daughter who is in middle school.  They do not have lockers so she needs a very sturdy rolling backpack.  This one was mentioned in a blog as being the best for middle school.  The wheels seem wonderful and the quality of the material is great BUT when it is full it does not stand up, even worse it falls forward.  All of the weight makes it just lay forward.  The base, which you install yourself is too small.  This backpack cannot be filled to capacity because it falls forward & It makes it difficult to get anything in or out because she has to hold it up the whole time.  Very frustrating.  UPDATE:  My daughter decided to just keep the backpack since she only had approx 4 mos left of school.  Within 2 months the zipper broke, she used a safety pin to keep it closed.  One month later a second zipper broke.  It barely made it through to the end of school.  I would never recommend this brand of backpack to anyone."
1.0,"They were too small for me.  I didn't realize they were non-returnable, so I'm stuck with them"
1.0,It is an ugly watch to me. The face is bigger than i thought it would be and so is the band.
1.0,This doesn't look anything like the picture. It's supposed to be a dress but it's a shirt. The tutu is very small not at all like the picture. I'm very unhappy with it
1.0,"This dress is really cheaply made, I can't even wear it. The straps don't sit right and the material is so thin and see through. It looks and feels like a costume. It is super stretchy, which isn't even a plus at this point because the dress is not wearable. I am sending it back. 1 star only because I had to."
1.0,Really wanted to like this dress but sent it back because it was so thin.
1.0,Fake product.
1.0,Doesn't fit my neck at all... I have other necklaces at this supposed chain length that do fit me so maybe they're measuring this differently? I can't wear it at all...
1.0,Broke after one week of use. Was simply just putting them on and “snap”!
1.0,"Cheap quality, cut weird in the hip area. See-thru fabric used for the skirt portion."
1.0,Somewhat small and the material was not what I expected.
1.0,"I bought 2 sets, since they looked like the ones I purchased at a local store. Boy was I wrong! My first set, after 2 years, are still working and in place. These hooks broke apart within 2 months time! I currently have only 3 purses hanging, and I doubt they'll last another month. And I need to say my purses are not heavy nor large. Most are smaller that a shoebox. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!"
1.0,I have a number of Joules tops.  The material is top quality.  They wear well and wash well also.  This particular one was just too much pink for me.
1.0,This jewelry was very cheap and tacky. You get what you pay for. I threw it in the trash.
1.0,I bought this ring in January and it's all but black now. I regret buying this. Can I still return it
1.0,This product is much cheaper quality than it looks on the photos.<br />I also ordered an XXL and got a XL.  Would not recommend.
1.0,These were ridiculously large for a size 10. I even laid them next to my old pair of Bogs that are a size 10 and they are much bigger.
1.0,To small on top and way to big on the bottom had to send it back. They were fast on the return
1.0,Hurt like crazy
1.0,The hat is very small-child size
1.0,The screen print was printed backwards.<br />Not sure how someone would not catch that!
1.0,Much shorter than in the pictures. Will be returning!!
1.0,"La tela es muy corriente no vale pagar casi 40dolares por este vestido El encaje no es de calidad, en la foto se Mira fino pero NO LO ES<br />NO ES DE BUENA CALIDAD."
1.0,This jumpsuit was made for a child. The top part couldn't go pass my shoulders. This was definitely cut for a child.
1.0,"Buttons falling off, seams lose and coming apart🤬"
1.0,I ordered a size larger than I usually wear and yet I couldn't even get them on.  I had to give them to my niece.  I have a high instep and these shoes did not fit.  They have NO give to them at all.
1.0,Chain was broke
1.0,Too heavy for my mother over 70 years old
1.0,The sizing on this was just all wrong. Does not fit like it does in the picture.
1.0,"One earring arrived broken, the other broke in my hand as I was trying to figure out how to put it on my ear."
1.0,Turn my ears green 2nd day
1.0,Openned and fresh out of the package arrived Dirty and with holes. Pictures attached.
1.0,"This is the silliest “bra” I’ve ever seen it’s not like the picture at all it’s Teo tiny thin strips of fabric with a wire that seems designed to squeeze the girls like a vise. I’m very small very trim and petite, this bra fits like a mean bra thong and while that would be an interesting invention this wasn’t well executed or perhaps they didn’t make this for women or girls but 6 year old boys  It’s too bad because the fabric is very soft. If you zoom in on the picture of black bra you can see how the cups are way too small and are squishing the poor models breast on the sides. It’s quite painful and I’m practically flat chested."
1.0,Pasable
1.0,I ordered it become with couldn’t find anything else interesting.  Poor selection!!!!<br />My wife got the product:((( CHEAP product!<br />NO MRE PAJAMAGRAM
1.0,"So cheaply made, had I known I would of made one myself..why do I keep lying to myself thinking I'm going to get great things. This is more like a 99 cent item"
1.0,If the dress were Maybe a Cotton Blend and a bit longer it would have been a Winner.
1.0,Terrible quality. Imagine just putting a piece of 1 ply toilet paper over your face because that's precisely how this product is.
1.0,It's see thru spandex
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap looking.
1.0,"This is junk, not as advertised.  They will not refund my money, disgusting, taking advantage of online buyers.  Offer me a refund or I will NEVER BUY AGAIN."
1.0,I don't know why I keep trying with Jvini but they are always too small.
1.0,I am returning this coz they are small and to hard to put them on child's hand.
1.0,It is thin as paper. See thru. Not worth the money.
1.0,Not even close to old school tiger stripe
1.0,"My one star review is based on the misrepresentation of the item. The item pictured is NOT what you will receive. What I received is identical to a watchband I already own. I wanted to item with the clasp instead of the magnetic closure.<br /><br />As for the watchband itself, I cannot speak to that as I have not removed it from the packaging. The one I have already that is identical to the one sent, works fine. It is comfortable and holds fairly well. The magnet does attach itself to anything metal so be prepared for your watch band to move around some."
1.0,"The earrings are very pretty. They arrived on time, earlier than expected. I would have given them 5 stars rather than 4 if the hook on both earrings was tight. Only one of the hooks is tight while the other keeps coming undone (at the most inopportune time) & I have to constantly do an earring check to make sure that I have not lost one (they arrived this way so I can imagine with longer use, the one earring will get even looser & I'll have to do checks even more often). I've been wearing for several weeks & while they arrived very pretty, it didn't last. The entire back part of the loop on the outside is no longer silver. The paint or whatever used has all chipped off & they look horrible now. If I knew before purchasing what I know now, I probably wouldn't have bought them."
1.0,I love the color of this top but the size was ridiculous. I wear between a 1x and a 2x. I could not even put this on. The picture shows a regular 2x t-shirt underneath this top. I know it is supposed to be fitted but it’s a good 4 inches smaller. Also it’s supposed to be a mock turtleneck but it’s a full on turtleneck.
1.0,I have ordered for 10 pieces and I have just got 9. I could not wear just 9 and hence I am planning to return this product back.
1.0,I bought this ring for a present.  I gave to my daugher end of May. By end of August the turquoise fell out..Not recommended.
1.0,Do not waste time and money on this sunglasses.<br />Complete false advertisement. Quality of this sunglasses is same as one you can buy on the street for $5 or less.
1.0,Read the fine print....there is only one bag...I ordered based on the photo...may be a good product but way overpriced for one bag.
1.0,Cheap made hat
1.0,"The item arrived in very bad condition, one of the temple  is bent, and the nose pads are bented too."
1.0,MUCH TOO LARGE...ACTUALLY HUGE
1.0,I think these are for children. They are just way too small
1.0,"These fog up so quick that my lips weren't visible, which was the reason I bought them in the first place"
1.0,I didn’t even get to try it on. I noticed that the shipping bag was kind of sticky and ants from outside were flocking to it when it was delivered to my porch. When I opened the package the bag the dress was in was covered in a sticky pink/red substance kind of like when a pack of meat leaks in your grocery bag. It also smelled like rotting meat! No idea what it was. So gross
1.0,Im 5'2 they fit my sister who is 5'9!
1.0,had to return it.  Too small.
1.0,This jacket is so cheap. I took it straight from the package to the donation bag. It is made in China and has no label that states material or laundry instructions. The material reminds me of a salon apron. It also smells like plastic.
1.0,No dang good.
1.0,BIG WASTE OF MONEY
1.0,"Just delivered today, it's not blue, it's all black and grey. I have yet to take it out of the bag but I'm seriously disappointed"
1.0,I was sitting on my bed opening the package and accidentally dropped it.  It shattered into a dozen pieces.  This should be advertised as a wall display and not a mask.  Very fragile.  Would not suggest wearing.  Get plastic or rubber made instead.
1.0,"So I bought this same top in grey and it’s so soft and good quality. I liked it so much I bought this rainbow too, it’s bad quality and not soft. Weird"
1.0,The sizing is way off. Would better fit a child and the material is cheap and very sheer.
1.0,"Overall size is geared towards small children.  When trying to stretch a bit, the elastic just gives out and stitching pops.  No other way to put it - these masks are garbage."
1.0,I only wore this one day...  Nylon is very cheap!  I am returning ASAP😫.
1.0,"Very thin fabric, can see clothes underneath if there's a lot of contrast. Not like a jersey cloth hoodie at all. The printing is smooth and crisp, but it's not very useful for warmth."
1.0,I purchased these for my wife who is an MA. She wore them 4 times and they ripped. I have contacted the seller and they won't replace them. They only allow a 7 day return/replacement policy.
1.0,"Total garbage, literally. I threw it away."
1.0,Both broke the first hour we had them on. Not worth it
1.0,I ordered a 4 X and if you look at the size chart-that is woman's size 16. Otherwise it is a nice jacket.
1.0,I got the pendulum but with out satin pouch . I don't understand why .im not sutisfact
1.0,Really too small. I'm a 14 it seems to be about a 10. Giving it away.
1.0,while I love the pants and how they fit they came with a whole in them. I noticed after wearing only for about 2 hours; too much of a hassle to return. While I love the fit of these pants I would not buy again due to being damaged. I will just sew these myself to keep.
1.0,"These are bulky or &#34;oversized.&#34; More like small money clips than tie bars. I would return them, but the seller never responded."
1.0,Received wrong item and very baggy. I would not recommend.
1.0,way to small for my daughters wrist!! I think it should have given you the size before you ordered.
1.0,I ordered a two piece set of a gown with robe but when package arrived there was only a robe and no gown. Very disappointed
1.0,"I am on the smaller side, about 120 pounds, B cup.  A 7-8 should have fit, maybe even been a little big.  However, these were so ridiculously tiny I could not even get one on.  Saving $$ on material doesn't work if your customers are just going to send them back!  Pathetic!"
1.0,DO NOT like the fabric at all!!!! Very super disappointed
1.0,"These earrings are not made well at all. The ""diamonds"" are so small that you can barely see them, and the first time that I wore them, the post broke off."
1.0,"At first I was really happy with this shoe. It fit my daughter really well. However, they do not hold up well at all. My daughter has had them for less than a month and they already look like they have been worn for a couple of years. Very disappointed."
1.0,"I ordered this bracelet as a Chrismas present for my mom as well as 2 other bracelets (or my niece and my daughter).  the latter 2 were fine, but this one cam broken; both ends' loops were bent open, and the locking mechanism was completely off.<br /><br />Very dissappointing because it looked so pretty online..."
1.0,"My wife wanted an umbrella for the back yard, so I bought her this one, which looked like on that she had been looking at in a store.  When it arrived, I quickly realized that this one was much less than what we had wanted.  It is so top heavy and the base is so weak that it can barely hold itself upright on a calm day.  Add in the slightest hint of wind, and it is swaying and tipping over.  I tried placing stones around the base, but everything just bent and twisted.  To make matters worse, after only a few weeks of having it, the plastic swivel connecter at the very top snapped, rendering the entire umbrella useless."
1.0,"Paid almost $50 for this and the sizing was off by 4-5 inches!! Doesn’t fit, haven’t heard back from seller. Getting very frustrated. Quality also sucks"
1.0,"I bought xl.so it fits loose,because I'm a 6/8 med.size.way way I mean super Xtra small.it was so  uncomfortable ."
1.0,"These were enormous, which i was not expecting at all"
1.0,"0 stars deserved, 1 star as it is required. Product arrived with one arm screw hanging out, and it cannot be tightened as it appears the hole is too large for the screw. These are worthless and cannot be worn. They are also flat, no curve to the frames etc. even if the pair was not damaged, they would do little to keep the sun out as would leave huge gaps on the sides. Worst kids glasses I have ever seen. I tried to return, but it says item not eligible for return. The description says 30 day money back guarantee, hopefully Amazon customer service can assist. Save your money, buy another brand. We have great luck with the Polaroid kids glasses, we love those.<br /><br />Update: 12/11/18 - Amazon customer service was outstanding like always and was extremely helpful. I still would not recommend these glasses, but highly recommend using Amazon for purchases."
1.0,All of the paint chipped off right away and now you can't even tell it's a daisy.
1.0,This is a product that is NOT true to size no matter what the size guide says. The material is very thin. Not a fall shirt for WV.
1.0,"Maybe just me but this looked totally unflattering. It's baggy in the weirdest places. I'm also tall (5'10"") and it ended up barely covering my butt and bunches up a lot. I usually look great in sweater dresses... this was just wrong. Too bad..."
1.0,"I ordered  L size shirt with this company, but after 3 washes it became small size shirt. Hardly I was able to wear this shirt for 4 or 5 times. Very bad quality, it's just waste of money on buying this product."
1.0,"The sunglasses are great, and my daughter loves them. I'm disappointed with the little picture of dory in the corner,  after a few weeks of relatively gentle care (she is 3, after all) the image is peeling. Her previous, similar pair never had any issues.<br /><br />Update: the frame has now broken along the the top. Sunglasses for kids really need to be more durable.  We did not get our money's worth with these ones."
1.0,These people who vend these don't pay attention. I have bought these more than once and rarely get the same size as before.<br />Also screws fall out easily.
1.0,Lock jammed!
1.0,"Cute, but definitely not an ankle bracelet. Wouldn't buy this unless you want to wear on your wrist."
1.0,Very dissatisfied. They will take it back
1.0,I love the the outfit but it didn’t even fit way too small please fix the sizes
1.0,I am very disappointed in this product.<br />It is not fleece lined as described in the product description.
1.0,It is a static spandex material and not tye dye. It is printed on and looks more like a weird camo style print? Disappointed.  :(
1.0,"It does not fit not even the wrist of a child, I always wear 7.5 on bracelets"
1.0,IT 'S HUGE & I HATE IT!
1.0,Years ago I bought this cap online and the size was perfect which was about 7 1/2 to 7 3/4.  I went to the store in Fullerton last year and bought two more thinking they were the same size.  Boy was I wrong.  The size is now a XXX-XXXX and the bill is 4plus inches.  Apparently they have changed the maker for these hats and they sized them too big.  To bad since it was the only place where you could get a XL-2XL cotton washed cap in a lot of colors.
1.0,Wanted to like this product and it just kept falling off no matter how much I adjusted on my boot. Thought i found a snug fit but I guess not. Flew off my first ride. Wasted $20. Do not buy
1.0,Cheap material it's a waste
1.0,These were not good head bands. I have not used them because of that. They are very thin.
1.0,I ordered  2 X way too small. Pattern lighter than picture.
1.0,These are NOT the sandals pictured. They are not even the same brand. The brand I received is called &#34;Wells&#34; and the straps are made out of totally different material than pictured. Pretty disappointed in that.
1.0,"They may be comfortable to wear, but I don't care for the wide ankle, or the  fabric.  I don't feel they will wear well.  Unfortunately, I didn't know how to return them, so I ha d them altered.  It will not be a repeat purchase."
1.0,The bottoms are the floral print but the suit bottoms are nothing like what is shown in the picture.  They are the old school 1980s high waist high cut bottoms and are too cheeky on the backside and show all your hip area.
1.0,"Not a good pair of shorts for anything<br /> Reason being they ride up the but crack and split the testicle in half, just a poor workmanship"
1.0,"Blouse did not fit correct.  The arm holes need to match the size you order.  Also, the strap was too big.  Just not fitted correctly throughout."
1.0,terrible made poor
1.0,Do not waste your money! If I could rate no stars I would. This dress looks NOTHING like the model! I am a thin petite person so no I didn't order it too small it barely goes off the shoulder it just looks like a piece of cloth draped over you. Horrible horrible what a waste of money!
1.0,Terrible stitching job...outfit look nothing like description
1.0,"Pretty watch.  Only problem is it doesn't work.  Good luck understanding the ""English"" in their brochure, or try to contact them in China"
1.0,It only came in one size for my charge 5. Big waste of money. My advice is if you want a different band make sure you go with the company that makes your item so you can get in correct size and it will fit correctly.
1.0,I was very disappointed when I recieved this bracelet broken didn't get to wear it for my birthday
1.0,Why to large and had to pay to return...will never order from them again
1.0,Extremely disappointed with product. the material is extremely cheap and strans easily . The picture give the impression of a cotton blend material . Horrible . I give it one star only because i couldnt post the review without aleast start rating .
1.0,"You can barely see the shark it’s printed way too low, and the swimmer is way too high. Can you even see the swimmer?<br />Don’t buy!!!!"
1.0,Should have returned but gave to my daughter.  Large ordered was like extra small.
1.0,"Loved the print and feel of the material. Only I can’t wear it. It is way to large. I have to my daughter, size XL."
1.0,"I like the response of customer service. The pants however are not accurate to the size chart and the waist is barely elastic. My waist is 34, according to the chart I am suppose to get a medium, the pants came and they could not fit me. The pants were too tight on the waist and restricted movement even though I went with what it said I should get on the provided size chart. Stay away."
1.0,I have a big head and these were even too big for me.
1.0,Sleeve rips if it’s stretched.<br />Clothes a little tight fitting..<br />I took this as an L
1.0,"I bought these as a gift, but they are so much smaller than the previous set I purchased.  I would like to have the larger version shipped to me.<br />thank you,"
1.0,Came with discoloration and it wasn't oxidation or simply tarnished  like a lot of silver.  It wouldn't come off even with sterling silver cleaner. Eventually more  spots appeared and couldn't be be removed so I doubt they're genuine.
1.0,This is junk. It came without a keychain or a place to even attach one.
1.0,"I loved the band until Friday, February first. That's when my band broke. Unfortunately my return window ended January 31st. Ugh."
1.0,"As another reviewer mentioned, the upper strap is HUGE! Perhaps an elephant could wear them, but I sure can't! Why didn't I listen instead of taking a chance? Back they go..."
1.0,Awful! The shirt looks nothing like the shirt depicted for sale it’s not even tie dye like it’s supposed to be! What a waste of money!
1.0,Very cheap looking and fabric horrible!
1.0,"The hat was so damaged,  it is unwearble.  Waste of money! Very disappointed"
1.0,The Mask Were Nice Looking But My Face Broke out In A Rash From Them! Do not Recommend Them
1.0,"One of the studs broke off from the post while I was taking it out of the package.  It looks cheap, and made cheap and it does not say made in the US or hypoallergenic.  It's not even in the packaging shown in the picture. It doesn't look anything like the picture and probably worth about 2 cents, but with shipping and handling I paid $7.50.  I'm very disappointed!"
1.0,This dress is not worth the money! It’s poorly made!
1.0,"These glasses cracked from the top of the lens, they felt like they were previously worn and stretched out and barely would stay on the face."
1.0,Sad I paid for this bra... it ripped and now it's gone and so is my money.
1.0,Head wouldn't stay blown up.. air was leaking on side
1.0,"Although a good idea, the product was cheaply made.  The velcro came off on the first use and the stitching on one of the finger tips came apart.  I guess they're better than nothing.  They were in my jeep for emergencies for the last couple of months and when I needed them, they came apart.  Poor quality."
1.0,I did not like the free glasses actually I almost sent the order back thinking they were the ones i received for my order (made in China) until I looked forward and fond the Italy made glasses.  I do not like the hinges engender I ordered I assumed they were the spring type on my old 2113  ray bans they were not and I suite will not lady thanks
1.0,They fell apart within 2 days.
1.0,"This dress was cute until it was washed. It is a rayon so it crinkles when washed. However, the brown faded and now a different shade. Very disappointing."
1.0,Very poor quality. They fell apart after just a month. Don't waste your money on them.
1.0,I received this package a month after I ordered it which was to be expected. This dress fits very weird. It is way bigger on top than it is on the bottom (Its reverse that what it normally is).I even ordered up a size.  Length is shorter than expected. Material is somewhat nice. I will be trying to return this item. If you do order this dress order at least 2 sizes up in U.S. sizes!
1.0,Way to big. Got teen 6.5 it was over 7.5 measured
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,"understandably sizes can run a little small or a little big, every brand is different, however, this was 2-4 sizes too small.  very disappointing."
1.0,"The color and quality of the metal is actually not bad, but these are way too big to look real."
1.0,I bought several of these for my grandmother this is the only one that was way to big and had a hole.
1.0,"I wear a medium in mainstream sizing. These made in china, cheap knock off. I would need a extra large to fit. I'm a size 8 in normal clothes from say, Target...  it's not just the fit, it's the quality too."
1.0,"the picture is soooo much better. it does NOT have a tapered waist. just a dull, cheap dress with a seam line at the waist."
1.0,"Cute earrings while it lasted. Then they got slightly wet with water and literally just melted into unrecognizable goo. All the paint ran together. If you decide to get these, don't set your expectations too high and KEEP THEM DRY!"
1.0,It looked nice & dainty but the chain broke easily. I never got to wear it.
1.0,"The worst material possible, shiny<br />The price should have warned me!!!<br />I had to return it"
1.0,Asian sizes
1.0,"Ugly,not stretchy,ugly"
1.0,"Too big in the chest and waist, too small in the arms. Disappointed."
1.0,Cheap. Very cheap. The jacket I received had missing inside liner in spots. Was too big. The sleeves have a funky way of tightening. Went back. And I still haven’t received a refund.
1.0,The necklaces break really easily.
1.0,"These appeared to be of high quality upon arrival, and worked well for a couple of weeks. However, the locking mechanism that clips to the shirt quickly fell apart on both sets. Pretty disappointed given the price. Oh well, the search continues."
1.0,I ordered a medium and it for very weird and boxy! I returned it.
1.0,The thing is so small you can barely tell what it is.
1.0,"Very thin material, loose threads.  Bought as a gift but ultimately didn't give because they seemed so cheap."
1.0,Not comfortable and CDC states they do not work so what is the point?!
1.0,"Not what I expected. Pendant is heavy and clunky, chunky and loose  I got three of these thinking I’d give as gifts but was so disappointed, I put them in the Goodwill box. Booo."
1.0,"Waaaay too short, I'm 5'4"
1.0,These glasses look great and that is why I bought them but they are horrible quality. They snapped and broke within a week of having them. Really disappointed by them.
1.0,"I'm having to return it, I ordered it for my brother new phone & sure enough in the mean time of ordering & getting a new case his phone got cracked on one of the bottom corners which wouldn't have happened if this had been a case that actually fits his phone! This case is too short for the z<br />S8 & have a cut out for the home button which the s8 does not have!"
1.0,First day wearing these leggings and already a hole. Cheaply made.
1.0,"Quality was sub-par in comparison to the ones I tried on in the store, so I tried to return them and got a ton of push back from the seller MADALUXE. Even Amazon reps were like “yeah…idk sorry 😬” just a generally terrible shopping experience."
1.0,Way too small and the black is completely sheer
1.0,"The style for this suit is very cute and I loved the boy shorts. However, if you are a larger chested woman, this suit won’t work for you. There is nothing to keep your boobs in place! No band underneath the chest. One good jump or swim and I’d be falling out the bottom or the top of this suit. So disappointing."
1.0,"Heavy material, Very see though and runs very large. I'm a small, ordered a small. The small fits like an XL. Very disappointing."
1.0,Socks were all faded very dull colors not like in the picture. They were very small as well. I know I have big feet(size 13) but they only came to my ankle like you wouldn’t see them unless I had flip flops on. To top it all off printed right on the Portugal flag it says France. ?????????? Shipping was super slow too. Zero stars. Take my star and shove it.
1.0,Do not buy these they are nothing like the photos and now I need to buy new ones for Halloween
1.0,Sent back.  Way to small for watch I have.
1.0,The material is thin and big by at least 2 sizes and doesn't look as nice as the photo
1.0,I ordered a 5 -  fits like a 10?
1.0,Too tight. I am returning it. If it wasn't I would keep it. Beautiful print and colors. And a good length since I'm 5'2&#34;.
1.0,"Returned these. I ordered a size up because of other reviews I saw but the material was so thin and clingy even with it not being too small, the fact that it was fitted made it very unflattering!"
1.0,"I ordered this bag to hold supplies for me as I am a house calls PT. After less than 6 months of use the bag’s carrier strap broke off and the zipper on the bag fell off. Bought this brand based on a recd from a fellow home care nurse. Completely disappointed with this product.- -*Updating this review, to Hopkins credit they sent a new bag to me after the review. However the carrier strap broke again today*"
1.0,"Looked good and worked well until battery died in less than 8 months, then didn't work atyer new battery installed."
1.0,"When will companies learn that saving a few micro cents by cutting back on pocket quality just causes customer dissatisfaction. So if you want a comfortable place for your hands (in your pockets), keep your 10 year old Gramicci's and forget about replacing them with these POS's."
1.0,Actually made the watch run faster!
1.0,Silly smelly hat
1.0,No.me sirvió porque no preguntan si ay algún  otro modelo con el.mismo nombre y no preguntamos el tamaño  de los lente ...lo cual me hizo pensar que solo había ese modelo ....pero no fue así...lo cual la inversión fue perdida.
1.0,"I dislike , the shirt came with a stain under the arm, looks deodorant, looks like it was already used"
1.0,"These masks are only two-ply and the cotton is extremely thin with no pocket to add you own filter. While comfortable to wear and stylish, I personally would not count on them for real protection in areas of prolonged exposure even with 6 ft social distancing."
1.0,Don't buy unless you plan to only wear in the bedroom!!  The front hangs half way down your stomach  like a sack and it's so short it doesn't even cover half my rear end and I'm only 5'4!! I ordered a large because of other reviews about running small..guess there's no way to guess what size you'll need in this when you order.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Broke the rubber strap away from the foot body on the first day out.
1.0,"This watch, which says &#34;water resistant&#34; right on the face, fogged up after like one month of wear and then promptly told me it was 10:84 and died. Not a great buy!"
1.0,Scratches way to easy and are flimsy.
1.0,"Nice pair of fits overs but they are not polarized even though it appears to state such on packaging.  They can be had with optional polarized lens but the packaging labeled G300S that I have is not polarized.<br /><br />There is a simple test that you can do to determine if a pair of sunglasses is polarized.  Take a pair of sunglasses that are known to be polarized and overlay them on the pair you wish to verify.  You should be able to see through both pairs.  Now rotate one pair such that is at right angles to the other.  If you can look through any two lenses that overlap, then one pair is not polarized.  Two polarized lenses that are at right angles should prevent light from passing through.<br /><br />The reason I gave it it one star is because of the confusing labeling on the product's wrapper.  Credit does go to Amazon for not getting confused about the product's labeling and by never stating it is polarized."
1.0,"The gloves are not made well ,especially for adult size. The fingers are very tight .My daughter could hardly get<br />her fingers in them. She can not wear them Useless!! Also its posted that they are good for -4 degrees Are you<br />kidding me!!!!  I was out shoveling snow with them at 27 degrees and my finger tips went numb.<br />The worst investment I have ever made in clothing. I want to return them."
1.0,"La calidad y la tela del vestido son inmejorables, el detalle es que es muy reducido del busto, soy talla chica y no me quedó, lo cambie por un mediano y tampoco me quedó! Lástima porque está muy bonito."

1.0,Fell apart after wearing it less than 1 month.
1.0,"Our 4-year-old thought these were the coolest shoes ever until the giant charging plug near the instep started causing discomfort. No clue why it is where it is. Do not buy.<br /><br />I used an Xacto knife to pierce a hold through the side and pushed the charging wire to the outside. You can still feel the wire as it runs up the side a bit but this is better than nothing.<br /><br />All these rave reviews are whack, don't buy these shoes."
1.0,I had to return this because I received the wrong item. Would not recommend.

1.0,The material isn't good at all.
1.0,They look good but they only last 2 days and the back piece broke..
1.0,"I ordered the set, but only recieved the top. The top looks great, but it would have been better if the shorts were also sent. I haven't heard back from the seller after leaving them a message about the missing shorts."
1.0,The fabric is too wrinkled even at arrival.
1.0,"Sized too, too small<br />Had to return."

1.0,Literally hate it feels like its made out of a soft craft foam. Don't buy

1.0,"The length of this sweater is way too long, frumpy looking, returning"
1.0,Material is too cheap and not worth whAt I paid.
1.0,These are the dumbest earrings I've ever purchased. You have to insert them backward and the stem is too thick to go inside the pierced hole. What a waste of money.
1.0,Color isn't the same as the picture. They don't fit men's feet. They barely fit my women's 8.5 foot.
1.0,These earrings hurt so bad! I done stretched  them out and still hurt. I order these type all the time but don’t know why these hurt so bad! 😡😡😡😡
1.0,Loved the look of the pants. Washed per instructions to soften the material. The product shrunk. Unwearable now.
1.0,"I know the description says loose fit, but whoa!  It is huge.  I ordered a large and it is enormous.  I have a 17.5&#34; neck and the neck line hung down to my chest.  Made my neck look pencil thin.  This is a big disappointment.  I have a couple old Russell sweatshirts I was hoping to replace.  Good thing for free returns."
1.0,"Socks barely cover my ankles and have shed black fuzz all over my house; in my bed, on my carpet, and in my bathroom. Sorry I had this item on my wish list.  My sister wasted her money. I am going to have to throw them away. Only reason they got one star is because they are soft."
1.0,Only fits on people who have super short torsos.  Do not buy!!
1.0,The website clearly shows the outer sole edging is black. The ones I received are white which I do not like. I will buy some dye and change the color myself.
1.0,Ordered UK and color is purple not blue. Disappointing
1.0,Too small for the size mentioned
1.0,"Dress was very small. When I went to return it, the POstage stage was going to cost as much as the dress so I gave it away. It also took weeks to arrive.  It you want to try this because of the price definitely order up in size."
1.0,way to huge
1.0,"Huge. Will not shut if you use all of the card holders. Zippered part would be great to use but case will not stay closed if you do.  Plastic trim that holds the phone in place is cheap and broke after 3 months, phone slipped out, screen completely shattered. Looking for a  new case."
1.0,"Was super bummed about these shoes. They fit great and were cute, but one of them didn’t light up. And they smelled so awful. Like they were soaked in perfume. My husband opened the box and it made his eyes start watering they smelled so bad. It stunk up our whole house! Had to send them back."
1.0,"This jacket is ok, it fits on the small side. It's also a weird material. Almost like silky. The price was right so I decided to give it a try but it's more like a sweater than a blazer.... a little disappointed, i was hoping I'd love it but i dont!"
1.0,Very small.. looks nithing like picture if i could give it negative stars I would
1.0,Ball would not come unscrewed
1.0,Cute shirt but their sizing is WAY off.  Order about 3 sizes up if you actually plan on wearing it!
1.0,Did not come with any straps
1.0,I guess imma 16 lrg because even with the elasticity of these I still couldn't fit them i gave them away. Although I do wear a size 16 tho.
1.0,"This dress was cheaply made! It had a huge amount of fabric in the midsection, and no seam at the collar. I ordered a small and I am 5’5” and 140 pounds. See the photos for the fit. I do not recommend this purchase."
1.0,The sizing is weird. Definitely do try before you but it doesn’t work with all body shapes! If you are a little bigger and want it to look flowy it will Judy make you look huge!
1.0,My Shih Tzu couldn’t fit into this dress! Lol<br />Stop it!! Too little for a human
1.0,nice smok but very  poorly made the ties came off of both that I bought

1.0,"I was so disappointed when I received the earrings. They were much bigger than I thought, but the style is still pretty. One of the earrings was bent and the material wasn't like any sterling or stainless steel earrings I've ever had.  My ear lobes started itching almost as soon as I put them on.  Both earrings kept  falling off the first time I wore them ( I was sitting down at brunch). I've been very pleased with my three other earring purchases from Amazon, but not these."
1.0,This worked great for my husband for 2 weeks then it just stopped charging.

1.0,"Very small,, doesn’t even fit like the photo shows"
1.0,"the 3xl shirt is the same size as a regular large shirt. Took over a month for this Japanese shirt, made in China, to be delivered to my area."
1.0,cheap and junky
1.0,Cute but came with a rip in the seam of the reindeer on the front of the mask and the stuffing was falling out
1.0,disappointed it looks cheap
1.0,Looks cheap and not like the picture to big in the crotch area looks like someone with much bigger lips stretched them out if you get my drift
1.0,"Almost all the charms broken, when I went to put them on shoe broke never again cheap product"
1.0,"I ecpected enough foam to insert in three hats, unfortunately, the picture looks much larger."

1.0,Only had one nose guard so hurts when wearing
1.0,"Wasn’t how it looked like in the pictures, it looked like it was made by a 2 year old"
1.0,"I opted to purchase this necklace because I have wanted a wanted moissanite and I felt like this was a very good price.  Moissanite is supposed to have a higher refractive index than diamonds have... meaning, they are supposed to sparkle and have more fire than a diamond does. The necklace arrive and the stone was cloudy and had zero fire or sparkle, and I mean non whatsoever. I even tried taking it outside and moving the stone to try in the sunlight and the stone was dead looking. I am assuming that the stone was maybe plastic and not moissanite at all. I don't know for sure. I didn't bother to take it to a jeweler. The silver wasn't very shiny either. Over all, I was disappointed, but grateful for the free return policy."
1.0,Very thin and very tiny not good quality at all but it is cute
1.0,Not worth a penny. Looks like a shrinky dink glued on the ring. I'm ticked!!
1.0,Terrible not the dress ordered at all
1.0,Missing some diamonds upon arrival but made it work for my daughter 5th grade graduation
1.0,"To small. Cheap fabric, shrunk when washed."
1.0,Material is very thin…
1.0,This is not at all as described. The bodice is COMPLETELY see-through.<br />Size did fit as expected though.
1.0,"I had to change my review.  It has a great concept, looks nice and would have bought the set...but it does not last.  There is a serious design flaw...the cut end does not go deep enough into the teeth grib into the buckle, and the belt releases from the buckle in a few days.  Clip the rough end again, same thing.  It simply is a serious flaw design-warning...don't buy.  Sad too, really would enjoy buying these belts if the only tested them...and had a better grip to permanently attach the belt"
1.0,"I did not like this item, once i started taking it out of the bag a bunch of stars and glitter sprinkles came out. Once i saw that i immediately placed it back in the bag. I had to order another skirt. So this one is going back."
1.0,Broke almost as soon as I got it
1.0,The chains are visibly flawed and one is so stiff it doesn't &#34;dangle.&#34; The studs are obviously dipped in something cheap and not smooth or uniform. I am returning these.
1.0,Terribke quality cheaply made color was no where the same as pictured
1.0,Horrible the worst poorly made sweater I have ever seen. I wish I would have never bought it!
1.0,This hat tore at the seam the first hour of wear. It has great poolside potential but the quality was poor.
1.0,I bought this last minute for my daughter’s DIY Coraline costume. I pinned this into the fabric lining of a wig to resemble her dragonfly hair clip. The pin itself was so short that it didn’t make good contact with the ’clasp’ part so it fell off and broke. We lost a few jewels and bent the pin back so we couldn’t fix it. It went straight to the trash.
1.0,If I could give this zero stars I would it was all pretty when I got it but wore it for one day in my septum and it changed color like black and rustic and smelled like cheep metal .
1.0,My son really likes these shoe but before he even got to wear them I noticed the design is pealing right off the shoe. The shoe overall seems nice but It shouldn’t be peaking off right out the bag. Also runs big
1.0,The necklace  had kinks and sharp edges and broke very easily.
1.0,very VERY small
1.0,The case is just cheap plastic but when you lie and say it  temper glass and it just plastic.
1.0,The dress was pretty and soft but very sheer. Could not enjoy because it was so see through
1.0,I got this watch for my husband because he is in the wood business so it looks great and was a great conversation piece. When he got it he loved it but it was a little too big. We took it to all the jewelry stores near us and no one was able to take out any links so unfortunately he can't even wear it because it is too big and can't be fixed.
1.0,No good quality.
1.0,Zipper burst while putting it on
1.0,Fits very small. The lettering also sticks to eachother
1.0,I ordered these socks in color B and I received color A. I paid more for color B also.
1.0,arms openings are too small and the dimensions do not match the ones listed on the website.  I sent it back.  I have ordered 4 items.  2 I had to send back because they are too small.  One I fixed myself by enlarging the armholes and adding to the sleeve length.  Great dress if you feel like resewing it.  the models are really small people so it looks like it would be long but measures just 32&#34;.  If this company wants to sell to the american market then they should use models that reflect this market.  I like the styling but am very disappointed to find out that they are not sized for this market.
1.0,Defective. Seam undone. Out of stock to exchange.
1.0,"Wanted to like this trail loop band, but it ended up being too tight on my wrist. Returning this ASAP.<br /><br />I think I’m going to have to take a break on trail loops for a while until someone decides to bring out a larger size trail loop band that can fit more comfortably…"
1.0,"Poor quality, all tangled in knots in a plastic ziplock bag"
1.0,Do Not buy !!! Looks horribly cheap and didn't show up for about 5 months after ordering ! It don't as supposed to be a Christmas gift !
1.0,Returned. Much smaller than size chart shown
1.0,Too large and the return fee is outrageous...
1.0,These were much smaller than I expected and are not real. They have since changed colors and look like rusted silver.
1.0,The shirt was very poorly made.  The material was very lightweight and wrinkled...the material itself looked flawed.  I don't think ironing would even have removed them and wasn't going to try...thanks but no thanks.
1.0,Plastic.  It says alloy but it's all plastic.
1.0,Black strap did not have clip on one side. I am unable to use this.
1.0,"The case is too small to for anything other than a controller and a charge cable. Why they sell this as a bundle with the phone holder? No idea! I'm planning on getting the more expensive non-orzly brand case, i can for more in there at least."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ba3d1013439f12b498733c2969aac707]] This was a Christmas Present that arrived late and has a disgusting smell. I was expecting a hard plastic helmet with lights. Received something different and now have a disappointed son!
1.0,El peor producto que he comprado
1.0,When I received the product all the metal pieces were rusted and had even worn off on the fabric part of it! Returned it immediately. I am actually offended that they even packaged it up like that and sent it out!
1.0,The arm and around the top of the dress is not true to size. I love the dress. I had to get my seamstress to open it up some
1.0,"I ordered a size 14 & it was a bit big. I then ordered a 12 & it was huge! I returned both suits, but so far have only received credit for one."
1.0,I was expecting a double layer fabric. You could see through the fabric so it wouldn’t work for my needs.
1.0,What you see is not what you will get. The gold part looks like a 3 year old paste it on. They don't look delicate.
1.0,These glasses didn't work for me. I was hoping to stop the awful glare from oncoming lights at night. Sadly they didn't work at all.
1.0,"Baggy for the product, not worth the purchase."
1.0,The construction on this seems to be pretty poor.
1.0,The distance between the ring and the wrist is too short - couldn't wear it - very uncomfortable.  Waste of money!
1.0,"Shrunk, cheap! Don't buy!"
1.0,what the heck?  This was supposed to be a 2 piece set and all that I received was the skirt which felt cheap... Definitely not as full as I expected and didn't even lay right!  Did I mention NO TOP??!!!  Just printed my return label as this was a waste of my time!  Boooo!!
1.0,Looks nothing like the fabric shown in the photo!!!
1.0,"I hate the repetitive false reviews for this product, with the exactly identical improper use of sentence structure in each of them.  It is obvious that someone with limited understanding of the English language wrote all of them."
1.0,This product is cheaply made and my daughter only got 1 wear out of it. She wore it for 2 hours and as soon is it was dry cleaned it started to fall apart. The material is very cheap and the dress all though looked good is absolute garbage. We bought it a couple weeks before a wedding and of course now its been 45 days and we cant send it back. It was lucky for us that the credit card we used covers us on unhappy purchases for damage for 90 days. This dress looks good but buyer beware the dress is complete garbage.
1.0,"If you want a super casual t-shirt dress, this will definitely work for you. However, if you’re looking for a semi-formal dress for work, holiday parties, funerals, etc. this is NOT the dress!"
1.0,The cotton material was very thin.  I returned these.
1.0,Update 9/6/17 I had to stop wearing it because it turned brown :( tarnish..rust.. unfortunately it made my neck and chest break out too which never does normally. I got compliments on this necklace and really liked it but it's trash now..
1.0,Really disappointed! Buttons fell off first day.
1.0,"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine and while it's adorable in theory, the quality is terrible."
1.0,They turn your skin black and they break and peel. Not even worth the price.
1.0,I wouldn’t buy this again.  They break easily.
1.0,"Bag is cheap, smells strongly of cheap plastic and looks cheap.  It is worth less than the cost to return it."
1.0,Fits two size smaller
1.0,This shirt is completely sheer and fits strangely in the front so as to make it look like it's on backwards.
1.0,I didn’t like the material it was scratchy and hard. Not what I expected. I returned this item. The fit was great 👍🏻
1.0,"I bought this for my mother, who is a tiny old lady.  I god 3x so it would be really bug for her and her dog.  It was still too small!!! Had to return it."
1.0,The mittens are stuffed with wool leaving such a small space for the hands to fit. The hat is so much larger than the mitten size. The wool is bad quality.
1.0,These are the worst bras ever. They don't provide coverage in the top portion of the breasts or the bottom. Spillage everywhere and YES I've had my breasts measured for accuracy. I wish I could return them. Violas secret is they make horrible bras
1.0,"This was probably my fault but I thought it is red, black and white. It’s actually red, blue and white. :( it’s also feels like paper it’s so thin!"
1.0,"They don't work. The loop slips off the temples of my standard frame reading glasses, constantly. Too inexpensive to return so the lesson learned is don't believe the reviews."
1.0,No structure awful shoe
1.0,Very poorly made!! Added items to largest cube and the zipper broke. The netting is also available super thin and ripped easily. I will not purchase again.
1.0,"Broke as soon as my girl hooped them in her ears, no backs with them either."
1.0,"Sending back, that sent wrong color, it's green not black, very small in middle section,  too big in shoulders and arms, a monkey must have put this together"
1.0,"If you are a true 6, 7, 8 & ect do not order. I am a true 8 in shoe size and figured the 8.5 would be fine and they were sadly too big and my friends 7.5 were too small for me. If you are a solid even shoe size then I suggest going with a different brand due to this one only carrying half sizes."
1.0,These are not at all easy on easy off. It is a struggle to put them on and just as much a struggle to take them off.<br />They are certainly not as advertised and not what I expected.
1.0,Way too small. They look like child size.
1.0,Looked like crap. Had to look very close to even see the specs that didn’t sparkle.
1.0,It was extremely thin and cheap feeling
1.0,Beautiful material. I ordered an XL. It wouldn't even be able to pass for a Large.My daughter who is a size 4 will be able to wear it. Very disappointed because it is a very pretty kimono.
1.0,The quality of this item is TERRIBLE I didn't even get to wear it for 2 hours and it tore at the seam.  The fit was awful...made.in China and it shows it.  Will never buy from this vendor again.
1.0,"These are a great idea.  My youngest wanted to give my eldest as a birthday gift.  I ordered on March 3rd, here it is March 25th and one already broke.  Needless to say, eldest was extremely upset."
1.0,"Elbow ripped through. Love DD and have a bunch of their shirts, but this disintegrated very quickly."
1.0,"for $40 this mask isnt worth it, the bottom half is rubber and just bends when hit so it hurts getting shot in the chin, it fogs pretty easy and the lens get dirty easily, it is now falling apart after just one game, it isnt very comfortable at all"
1.0,"Ordered for father daughter dance and had to find a last minute outfit... it had 3 different patterns on it...not whatbwe expected,  didnt fit like a 3x"
1.0,These items arenot meant for the Romeo II's as it was emplied on the add. I am still searching for the correct ones.
1.0,The necklace shape is totally different then the picture. It looks like a funky horseshoe. Don't buy this if you're expecting the thing in the photo.
1.0,I never have my stuff
1.0,"Very pretty, but way too big for my Yamay ID205. Description very misleading. Definitely not 23mm. Also, not really scrunchie looking straight out of the package."
1.0,These belly rings tarnished in less than 24 hours 👎🏽
1.0,it came in two pieces and very poorly made. It's falling to pieces every time i wear it! piece of crap.
1.0,Sleeve fell off.
1.0,Dearlovers Women Casual High Waisted African Floral Print A Line Maxi Long Skirt with Pockets is the skirt that I ordered size XL. However I received a blue multi color medium size skirt. It is so disappointing. The skirt is well made out of a great material but it is not what I ordered. I live in The Bahamas . I have to pay import taxes and extra shipping fees to have my items delivered from my US freight forwarders to me in The Bahamas. So it is costly to return and reorder. The skirt cannot fit me. I paid for something different. I got the short end of the stick.
1.0,Sorry not what I expected cheap looking didn't fit right didn't line up right that's all I have to say
1.0,"Good size but NOT stiched well, arrived with one side ripped"

1.0,"No words...it's a nice looking band but the end links got stuck on my Gear 2 and when trying to remove the band, the band broke leaving the end links in. This resulted in me having to send my Gear 2 to Samsung for a repair."
1.0,Very thin. Comes in a smaller size.
1.0,"Finally got it, tried it on, zipped it up, ZIPPER is broken......Not happy"
1.0,This was very small. It hardly does up on my wrist and is tight on my 12 year old. If your getting this for a toddler then you might be good. Not intended for an adult.
1.0,I wear it once and it is broken
1.0,Unfortunately this product is not what’s in the picture.  I received plain jewelry so I did an exchange and was sent the same plain jewelry once again.  Was hoping to get the crystal jewelry as shown and described. I’m returning both and will try a different store.
1.0,Shirt is nowhere near the size it is labeled as
1.0,I received a broken wach. Bad quality.
1.0,These slips are too stiff and too straight no give at all very uncomfortable.  They do not look like the picture that was posted.
1.0,Fits as if it's for a child. A child with a very small head.
1.0,Good news is that the material is great. Bad news is they claim one size fits all. Wrong!! They are a medium at best. I'm an XL and they don't even reach around enough to close. Returning both robes.
1.0,I did not receive the keychain
1.0,They lasted 10 days. Super cute but really bad quality
1.0,"The tag sucks! It's on the left seam and even after cutting it as close to the seam as possible, it's still irritating."
1.0,"Pros-better made then I thought it would be, would be great for a breastfeeding mother, it's pretty, the color matches well with the picture.<br /><br />Cons- the large is WAY WAY WAY to short! I mean, literal 5inches, if you're like 5'5-7&quot; i bet it would work wonderfully, but not for me being 5'10&quot;. Now onto the bust issue, if you're a B/C cup I bet it would work well, I'm a C/D cup, and it could fit better, with a bit of fiddling and modifying I've made it work though."
1.0,"i wanted a radio controlled solar watch with hands and numerals large enough to see.  I have a favorite but the dial is small.  This watch is next to useless.  After a lot of trial-and-error, I managed to set the time.  Except it's exactly 2 minutes off.  Do not waste your money."
1.0,Don’t buy from this vendor. The see-through  material and fit from this dress is terrible. You have to pay for return as there is no true free return( it cost more to return than the $3 that they will refund you).
1.0,The construction and fabric make the shirt look cheap.
1.0,"Silver color almost fully gone from weba and starting to go from spider,  I will be returning this item."
1.0,I couldn't find any information about the care of the item.  I stupidly ordered it and found out it needs to be dry cleaned.  Never would I order that needs to be dry cleaned.
1.0,Broke within a year. Poor quality
1.0,Could be fit like a medium and not like a large
1.0,"Material was a clingy knit,not waffle material ,as described.  It was very poor quality. The reviewers must have bought something else"
1.0,Sizing was crazy
1.0,I have small Cs to B cup breasts and this did not work for me. Wouldn’t stay on even while trying it on so was too afraid to even attempt to wear out. Had purchased for a bridesmaid dress and super disappointed and a waste of money.
1.0,Did not like the very cheap quality
1.0,"Couldn't figure out how to take the balls out took me a long time when i got it out, I couldn't put it in. Disappointed"
1.0,"Poor quality, the large size is more like a size 2 in US size."
1.0,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He has been wearing it to work 4 days a week for the past month, and it is now so stretched out that it is more like the shape of a bucket hat rather than a beenie. The Thinsulate also caused problems by not stretching, so I think the bottom stretched out more as he tried to pull it down far enough to cover his ears."
1.0,Cute dress but runs big! Had to return
1.0,"This bag looks nothing like the picture. Way different color. Plus there is a huge black stain on the bottom, and the clasp was burned. There is also all this weird white stuff on it werid. It is a lot smaller then I was expecting. It looks more like a purse then a computer book bag. All and all not as advertised. The biggest bummer is the color. It also says it is real leather, it feel like fake leather."
1.0,this product sucked. I will never ever ever again order from Allegra K. This looked absolutely nothing like what they do in the picture. I ordered a small and got a medium  and it fit like a garbage bag. Plus the material sucked.
1.0,"some scratch on both lenses, it made me most disappointed"
1.0,"Color so ugly, looks like McDonald's uniform.  Reddish clay color with pink and red stripes down sides of legs. Also very heavy, could not wear during summer."
1.0,I could barely walk in this skirt. In order to walk properly you would have to take tiny steps.
1.0,"This piece was for my son. The first day he wore it, it broke (and since the top part dropped, as it was detached, the seller wouldn't exchange or refund our money.  Not happy."
1.0,My 9 yr old saved up his own money for this watch. It broke within a couple weeks. He took very good care of it. Taking it off at bedtime and even showers. The face plate starting falling off first then the entire thing just stopped working. It really is a piece of junk... Now wondering if the warranty is even worth it because I am having to jump through hoops to get it replaced. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT BUY
1.0,Misleading!!  Bought as a prop for my daughter for Halloween.  It is tiny.  She ended up using as a prop for her dolls because I couldn’t return it.  Buyer beware!
1.0,the size was not a large 12 to 14 because i wear a size 10 and I ask for a lager and it still didn't fit.
1.0,I purchased this band for my husband. The second time he wore it the buckle came apart.  I am ready to return it.
1.0,disliked the tread
1.0,"I ordered this top in B-white. It came in the Khaki color. I was extremely upset to see i received the wrong color! I also have a bigger bust, so I ordered a size up to be safe. The shirt fit nicely across my chest, but is cropped at an awkward length and would not look good with the high waisted pants I intended on wearing with them."
1.0,I am normally a large. I order up to an XL and the sleeve length is way too short. & I am ONLY 5’3. quite disappointed.
1.0,Got a bikini top instead of bottoms.
1.0,"There’s zero compression in these, and they all ripped around the arms after just a few wears/washes.<br />Complete waste of money."
1.0,"I wanted this dress so bad, I tried to buy it in so many different sizes  it was poorly made and fit weird I bought it first in a medium and it looked like it was made for a child so I gave it to my 11 year old niece who is very thin it didn’t fit right on her either  so then I bought it in the largest size they had and it still didn’t fit right definitely not made for women with curves"
1.0,Just nonsense they were plum nonsense
1.0,Received post earrings rather than dangles. The weight of the earring in proportion to the post was too much and the post made a clean break when my daughter took them out of her ear the first day she wore them.<br /><br />Luckily Amazon is willing to refund my purchase as the seller would not respond to my emails.
1.0,"Purchased last August and plastic piece that holds the band onto the Fitbit broke, now it will not stay on."
1.0,This dress is horrible! Nothing like picture. It looks like a chyrch dress. Sending back!
1.0,Loved the band until it broke in half 10 days after I started wearing it.
1.0,Unlike hurt when wear it
1.0,These suck dont waste your $. I'm at a 9/16 trying to go to 5/8. These aren't even close to 5/8. They pushed straight thru what I'm already at. I'd say if you want these order a size higher than you really want. The quality is cheap light weight plastic feeling material.  These just went in the garbage and a waste of $.
1.0,sons pas vai jordan
1.0,Total waste of money....
1.0,"The liner in my bag ripped on second day of using, other than that super cute!"
1.0,"Most arrived broken, and the others, when you go to wear them, break while putting them on. WOULD NEVER buy again. Had to return."
1.0,"The box is item came in, was unsealed. I was unable to get the watch to run. I tried to change the battery, but the tool that was included which bent promptly.  I would not recommend this product for $50."
1.0,The material of this dress is thin and cheap. Definitely feels like a coverup - not a nice dress.
1.0,The bright ones fall
1.0,"No stars from me. First off, its a pretty pullover, that's why I ordered it. Second, why does it say 3XL when clearly it fits like a smedium. Third, I have to keep reminding myself not to order clothes from y'all online because the first and second time they were too small. I don't know who, what, or where y'all getting your measurements from, but they aren't accurate!!!"
1.0,I do not recommend this product. (just my opinion)
1.0,Ordered this for my fossil watch and it definitely didn't work out! I really liked this band and now I'm super bummed it didn't fit my 18mm watch
1.0,"I really wanted these to be as amazing as they look. Sadly they are not! The fabric is thin and ill fitting, the plastic used fogs up and has its sharp edges on the inside that slide your nose. I wish I could get my money back, what a waste"
1.0,The plastic cover came off after 3 months. And I only used it for less than 5 times. It was good until it broke. I had a similar one from other brand for over 20 years and it is still good. I am very disappointed at the quality of this umbrella
1.0,I got a hole in them
1.0,Two different reds. The shirt is maroon. The pants are red. Very noticeable. Not please with this product. The material is very comfortable though.
1.0,Modelo diferente...super pequeño ademas!
1.0,"I ordered the black/grey and received one labeled as black/grey but is definitely just black and doesn't look anything like the black/grey model in the pictures. Assumed it was a mistake and received a replacement- still just black! Very black. Nothing like the pictures.<br />The connectors hold at least, which is better than nothing, especially considering they are plastic and not metal. Still very disappointing. Would not buy again."
1.0,Quality and sizing just not there<br />And so cute in picture
1.0,Unfortunately it's one of the cheapest things you can buy off of Amazon don't waste your time are your money or energy
1.0,"I normally wear a small, 5'4&#34; 120 lbs, and according to manufacture measurements medium should have fit. It didn't. Shoulders too small, waist way too high. Bad bad fit."
1.0,"Es muy muy pequeña, pense que a pesar de no decir las medidas podria ser un poquito mas grande, y para colmo no trajo el corazon rojo por el cuál en un principio compre!"
1.0,"The rings look as pictured, so that's 1 star. I have had my rings for about a week and have not worn them daily. The rose gold is turning brown and the gold toned came rusted. I wasn't expecting them to look real but did expect them to be as advertised."
1.0,"I’m so disappointed. The moment the package arrived I knew purchasing it was a huge mistake. It came in an envelope. Not a box like I had hoped, and a ugly cheap envelope at that. The quality is horrible and it feels very cheap, like it came from the dollar store. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for a very special family member and now I’m almost embarrassed to give it to her. If it wasn’t so close to Christmas already, I would have definitely returned it and got my money back."
1.0,Awful product that does not provide cool comfort as advertised. Also very small bandannas that came in a small package (about3x6&#34;) and was mailed in a huge box (about 18x24&#34;) what a waste of packaging and postage!  Amazon needs to be more environmentally responsible!
1.0,"Pretty, but smelled like metal and is very small. Gave it as a gift and it didn't fit over the woman's hand. :-("
1.0,"These gloves might be fine in a cool dry climate but in a hot humid one such as New York in the summer, the fingers fuse together and the blue latex leaves a sticky mess on everything you touch."
1.0,"Cometi un error al efectuar esta compra: 1. Falta mejorar calidad, el calor lo derrite. 2. Por lo indicado en 1 se rompe y destruye rapido. 3. No cumple su funcion se vuelve pegajoso y  casi se derrite (clima de verano). No volveria a invertir hasta que mejoren calidad y diseño."
1.0,Earrings broke 1 week after purchase. Total waste of my money and time. Very disappointed in this product.
1.0,Cute but turned grey and dull after one time wearing it. Save your money.
1.0,It’s made very small
1.0,"Very disappointed. I received a used dress it was not new, it had a strong perfume odor"
1.0,It is not worth 40 bucks ten at best. Looks nothing like the mask above. Deluxe my ass should have just painted my face. If I can give it a lower rating I would. If the mask was like ten bucks I’d give it a five star but considering I’m rating the product based on the photo description I give it a negative five.
1.0,False advertisement. It looks nothing like the picture and it was expensive.
1.0,These earrings are so cheaply made. They were broken and crooked. Bad Quality do not recommend.
1.0,flemsy and small not worth the money
1.0,Very heavy and does not look like the picture. There is nothing shiny about this bracelet!!!
1.0,Might fit a 10 year old.. Poor quality material..
1.0,"SHAME ON THE MANUFACTURER!!!  Such potential to be a stunning dress, comes in lots of colors.... don't order unless you have time to return/exchange if you get one with shoddy workmanship.  I hope you can get one made well... it really is pretty.<br /><br />I ordered this on January 23rd, it kept being delayed and arrived on March 2nd.  I needed this for a destination formal wedding, it arrived so late there's no time to exchange it or find another gown. It fits as expected, style is classic and sexy, HOWEVER, the dress was made with the poorest workmanship!!!  My heart sank when I saw how badly sewn it was.<br /><br />In a panic, I went to three alterations, one did agreed to take my order with a large rush fee, the bodice will be taken apart and put back together.  I purchased it for $ 112.00 dollars. And now with rush fees will cost me quadruple to repair it, in time for my flight.<br /><br />It's shameful how poorly it was made. I can visualize someone cramming the fabric )two layers) through the machine. The entire bodice is puckered and rolling, the lining shows, they used the wrong boning in it, and the bodice seams stick up intermittently bunched up under the strap, crooked and bunched in the back, uneven darts, cup lining was larger than the outer fabric!<br /><br />SHAME ON THIS MANUFACTURER!  LOVELY GOWN, SERIOUSLY SHODDY WORKMANSHIP."
1.0,not as appealing in real life
1.0,Hate this. It is cheap and ugly. Don't order it.
1.0,"These sunglasses are cheap. They may have a semi expensive price tag but that means nothing. They broke after the third day I wore them. I had them in the hard shell compartment in my backpack that was designed for sunglasses. The frame broke, and the lens came out for one of the eyes. I would not recommend these to anyone."
1.0,Material had color variations that looked like it had stains. Also the tie on the back was so long I had to wrap it around to tie in the front. It was not flattering.
1.0,Doesn’t look like the model photo and the top is very cropped
1.0,Zipper pull came off before ever being used.
1.0,"How cheap is that? It's plastic, fine but no backings? Don't ever buy this product! Waste of $$"
1.0,It was pretty cool and nice for the price until about a month later 1 day it just started making this loud af high pitch noise and i had to hit it with a hammer bc throwing it or anything else wouldnt make it stop smh.
1.0,"Although the dragon pendent is nice the title description was 100% misleading it is not 999 sterling silver, you have to go to the details to learn that this pendant is 100% BRASS. This was a item my young daughter picked out for herself with her hard earned money because she loves dragons and wanted a real sterling silver piece to add to her collection- too bad it's brass and this seller way overcharged her for this piece. Should of charged like $10-15 for piece, not $65 for brass"
1.0,"Do you like the feeling of having a mouth piece in, like a boxer? Well if you do, this product is for you. You can't shut your mouth, it does't fit right, at all, no matter how you bend it. It puffs out your mouth, making you look stupid. You probably wouldn't notice if you have big lips, but alas,  I  am Caucasian, and these things suck. Waste of money."
1.0,Terrible! Print is awful. Looks like a children's garment. No way a women's outfit.
1.0,Stones kept falling out.
1.0,Fit very weird. Sent it back
1.0,"I agree with the other reviews. I was so anxious to get the cute shoes in the picture, only to receive junk. They were a half size too big as well! Dont waste your money! Hoping for a return."
1.0,"Not sure if the quality of these shirts went down or if I got a bad batch. But I had these same exact shirts for over a year with no issues.<br /><br />So I decided to buy 3 new ones for vacation, and within the first day of wearing it, the threading around the neck came undone. See pic."
1.0,This item totally fell apart -- the strap came off and both glass lenses fell out.
1.0,Very thin and not what I would consider running leggings at all.
1.0,Item way too small. Want me to pay return shipping which costs as much as the top. Better to donate it.
1.0,Not as expected and terrible smell.  Item returned
1.0,Broke with in the first two days of having it.
1.0,"Received a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DRESS from what is described and pictured! Dress is short, very short. It is black, but that is the only correct description."
1.0,Did not like was returned
1.0,Poor material and cheap quality
1.0,I bought this a size up and it was too small. Passed down to someone much smaller and it fit her well
1.0,I wear a 3X but ordered a 4X just in case.  The 4X fits like a 2X.
1.0,"I received this feather headband today for an event tonight. It was beautiful, but it kept falling apart during the three hours I wore it. By the time I got home,  it totally fell apart, the beaded part hit me in the face and the glue stuck to my hair. My daughter had to pull some of my hair out to remove it."
1.0,I think the XL is actually an XS.
1.0,It’s too tight<br />I would like to exchange but the return window has closed<br />Very unhappy to have a dress I cannot wear
1.0,Not true to size! Runs very small and cheap fabric!
1.0,This is super small and short enough to be a shirt.
1.0,"I was very drawn to the style of this. I’ve been in the process of losing weight and wanted to show off my improved waistline. I had just been measured, according to the size chart I’d fit in the 2X with some room. I was wrong. Also there was some awful discoloration on the shoulder, and the material is extremely thin/cheap. I am extremely disappointed."
1.0,"When I received this braclet it looks cheap and very cheesey, I guess you get what you pay for and I certainly did. I did order the black one and that one looks much better."
1.0,The very first time I was putting clothes in the zipper side the zipper completely came apart!! I had already painted my name on the outside. No slot of any kind to put a name tag in. I haven't even left my house for the airport. I hope the zipper holding the two sides together doesn't give out and i lose all my clothes. I threw away my receipts because it appeared to be a quality product. Now I guess I am stuck with it!!!!
1.0,"Purchased end of May , now early August the clasp has broken and I need to replace. I would love a refund or replacement as a watch band should last > 2 months.<br /><br />The band looks great and worked well, but only for those two months. Due to low cost, I would have been OK if it broke after a year-ish"
1.0,"I did not get the belt shown in the photo....The one I received has a black edge that is noticeable.<br />The ""back"" of the belt is more like the one in the pic.<br />Had I know this I would have chosen a different belt."
1.0,Very poor quality. Disappointed.
1.0,"Bought for my daughters birthday, did not glow in the dark."
1.0,Tooo small and cheap. The color is gorgeous though.
1.0,"This was nice looking. She liked it. But, after putting it on the clasp broke, then the chain, then it broke between the pentacle and the crystal. So very disappointing. I was so excited to give this to her to have her have a sad face."
1.0,The clasp does not stay closed and I lost a pendant with sentimental value over the weekend. Very disappointed. :(
1.0,"I Had to return,"
1.0,uses asian sizing (runs about a size small) and is made out of a weird thin plastic-y material. felt like a rain coat .  probably wouldnt suggest this one.
1.0,I just received my order today and I’m very very upset first of all it stinks when I opened the package it had like an old warehouse smell on it not to say the least it’s a BIG freaking hole in the private area where the stitch has unraveled and IM JUST NOW TAKING IT OUT OF THE PACK this is not worth $20+ I hate I spent my freaking money🤬🤬🤬🤬
1.0,Piece of s*** scam
1.0,"I ordered the large, which is what I normally wear in shirts, and this one is SMALL. Sleeves were too short, and the body of the shirt was snugger. I highly suggest sizing up!"
1.0,"Cheaply made, wrong color, too expensive for 1 strap."
1.0,"It’s ironic that this belt is made to promote sweating around your midsection; however the minute you begin to sweat the belt slips and slides up as high as your chest will allow. The silver neoprene material is not ideal, in fact it’s what makes this product horrible. There are so may other products I’d buy out there over this belt that make you sweat and stay in place."
1.0,"Order XXL, a green and black shirts.<br />Received what is probably large in a red and black shirt. Very disappointing."
1.0,Smelled like chemical and was plastic material.
1.0,Glasses are broken. Nose pad fell off within one week. Nice case though.

1.0,It's not true to size I bought a 3X but I wear a2x to make sure it is a overseas product and I do not think they no Americans true size
1.0,This dress should have been $5. Will be returning. Looks nothing like the picture. Kind of sweat-pant material.
1.0,No words can describe what this dress actually look like.
1.0,broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,somebody does know what a 2x large is. already returned for refund 57.77 via UPS
1.0,"Way to small , in the picture it looks like a super cute over sized sweater but really not the case !"
1.0,These were crap. Paper thin. If you try to iron it burns through (lowest setting). Am not happy about this at all. These were to apply vinyl and sell and now I’m stuck owing aprons this week. But these are embarrassing to sell.
1.0,"Very thin, stretch out"
1.0,Way to small! I should have known when it said it was coming from overseas!
1.0,Too small. Don’t stick and can’t fold back into back. Not what I was needing.
1.0,"This product works, but the build quality is bad. The rubber that holds the shirt in place came apart making one of the straps useless.I spend most of my time sitting in an office, and i find it very annoying when stuff just breaks for no reason."
1.0,The top of the dress is wired and fits to loose
1.0,"I am very disappointed with this product.  You can tell right away this is not a Pandora piece.  It is way too big for the bracelet.  This picture is very misleading.  I would not recommend anyone buy this product.  It is too much trouble to return so I will keep it, but it will not be worn.  I was looking forward to receiving this piece as this is where my husband and I were married.  To all who view, don't waste your money."
1.0,"I figured this would be low quality, but it actually looked great. The big rhinestone fell out the second day. I'll super glue it back. I bought it for my monkey obsessed daughter"
1.0,"Basically coming apart, and not worn every day."
1.0,Very small-Sized for teens and children
1.0,"there was a bad chemical smell (dose was out), but very small, hot and not breathable for me because they are 100% polyester."
1.0,"I had this watch for about 4 months and the lettering on the bezel fell out one day.  I contacted Casio customer support to fix the lettering thinking it would be under warranty.  I was told the bezel/case was not part of their warranty and they wanted $106 to fix the lettering.  That's outrageous!  This is supposed to be a high quality watch and a good company behind it, but I have experienced neither of these things."
1.0,Very cheaply made. I returned it.
1.0,"90% of these fake pearl beads have sharp, flat sides where they Clearly sat and dried. Man-Made pearls are small as well, about the size of an small raisin. I'd return these cheap crap if I could because I feel like I've been had.<br />This should come with an non-authenticity Warning: BUYER BEWARE"
1.0,I really didn't like the way they fit and think I am too short for this style of pants.
1.0,definitely a second. there is a seam in the leather on the top.
1.0,Not at all what I thought this would look like. Very disappointed.
1.0,"It's super cute so if you only care about having a cute accessory go for it.<br /><br />However, it runs VERY slow. If I set it for 12:00, it reads about 12:50 at 1:00.<br /><br />Can't keep time, so I will be returning it."
1.0,"When it works, it does the job.  But you'll go through 3 pieces of scrap for every segment you end up using because of how difficult the backing is to remove.  Stay away from this product."
1.0,Too small and fits very awkward in the front. It smushes your breasts down and didn’t fit good at all.
1.0,Poor quality even for as cheap as it is.
1.0,Lo peor que hemos comprado. Mala calidad totalmente malo
1.0,The item is too small and has alot of misspelled words
1.0,look forever to ship and get to me. doesn’t fit right
1.0,"Ridiculously small, big enough for a child. This item is a joke. Never got back my refund"
1.0,Didn’t like the way it fit.
1.0,Warning: Photo shows just flat straps. The straps have one flat strap and two braided straps.
1.0,This is not surgical steel. After having this nose in ring for a week my piercing became sore. The second I took it out and put my old nose ring in it went back to normal. I am very sensitive to metal so I immediately react to fake metal. Don’t buy if you’re very sensitive
1.0,Horrible product! Design on shirt is crooked and shirt material is cheap
1.0,Broke after 30 minutes of use. Terrible product!
1.0,I liked the style and colors but you definitely get what you pay for here. Cheaply made and the get caught on most everything.
1.0,"Bought these for my daughter for her Halloween Sofia costume. After reading some negative reviews I was skeptical but decided to go ahead with it anyway, out of desperation. The amulet broke in the first 5 minutes. The scepter jewels all fell out as well as some in the crown. Very poorly made. Don't expect any longevity out of this. No good for the dress up box."
1.0,"I was warned in the reviews that some shirts arrive defected. Mine showed up with only the logo, no wording at all.<br />I ordered the white Penn State Shirt in medium. The preview shows it has the logo and the &#34;PENN STATE&#34; lettering above up.<br />Sadly, that is not the shirt I received...  I returned it for a full refund."
1.0,The description for these said these socks have grippers and not one pair has a grippie bottom on them. I'm extremely dissatisfied.
1.0,it was a terrible shoe probably 2 sizes too large
1.0,I am disappointed in this product. Wouldn't order again.
1.0,Why would they sell a watchband without pins? It was cheap but shouldn't the pins be part of it??
1.0,Definitely not sterling silver as advertised.
1.0,"The settings do not permit setting the year, so the day of the week can not be accurate.<br />In my case it showed Monday for Wednesday with no way to fix."
1.0,Not was I thought they were. Did not work for me.
1.0,The pull over sweater runs very small.  Reordered 2 sizes larger.  Have not received it.
1.0,Pretty disappointed in this. It looks super cute online but it’s MASSIVE!! I got the smallest size and it fits like a large. I’m 5’8 and 130 lbs and I’m swimming in it. If you’re a taller and more curvy it might be cute because it’s actually long enough but definitely size down!!
1.0,It didn’t fit and it was not even the right color!
1.0,"Picture says a thousand word. See attachment.  No thickness to it at all. Just foam. None padded is very thin.The padded part Barely pushed in is about 1/8"".  Any push on it mades it as flat as 1/16"". That's no gel. I have gloves from 3 years ago with more padding."
1.0,inaccurate size and sleeves are strangely short as in it would have to be worn by a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
1.0,Could not open the clasp on the necklace. Can't wear

1.0,Item is thin and very short.
1.0,"Hamms patch only stitched on the ends, have to finish stitch the top/bottom"
1.0,Within one wear the seam looked like this. I’m so bummed because I have a friend who swears by them!
1.0,Thin material is thin and doesn’t stay stitched together. Fell apart during light hand washing
1.0,The earring is very pretty but<br />1. It is very heavy<br />2. The back side is very messed up<br />3. The second time I wore this earrings the back earrings holder kept falling out and I could not wear the earrings at all<br />Waste of my money and effort:(
1.0,Its too short
1.0,"Returned, cheap and did not close correctly"
1.0,Item not as described. There is no removable padding in the bras received. I’ve ordered these bras three times. Once there was padding as described and my daughter thinks there super comfortable so I ordered more.  My second order...no padding. Had to return for a credit. On the third order...no padding. Returning again. Be weary of the descriptions since apparently not all of their styles have padding as described.
1.0,Not as cute in person the pic on front is faded!
1.0,"Very thin, cheap fabric."
1.0,Worst material... worst stitching... worst shape... returning it right away...

1.0,Look good but are not comfortable and feel very fragile as if they will break easily!
1.0,Too small puckered around neck and sleeves no.
1.0,I wear this type of underwear in size large of many other brands.  They all fit fine.  I ordered these as kind of an upgrade.<br />But they run so small that I cannot wear them.<br />Tossed one I opened and donated the other 2 to charity.<br />Don't waste your money expecting something that will fit like other brands.
1.0,This backpack is so tiny and is made of the same material of a windbreaker. It feels so cheap and makes a ton of noice when you handle it
1.0,"When I opened the package, the picture was faint and and barely visible, along with there being minor scratches.  Poor quality, had to return."
1.0,"The description and tag say rayon, but it is not rayon. It's some kind of polyester blend. Feels awful and it's hot and not breathable. The cut is nice though, but I'm not going to be able to wear it or sleep in it."
1.0,"Runs very very small. I ordered two different sizes and they were exactly the same. The outfit is absolutely adorable! However, the craftsmanship is lacking. The sequins fall off very easily. Halloween was two months ago and I’m still finding sequins in my house!"
1.0,I bought this dress thinking it was cute but no it’s a weird fabric.
1.0,I tried to avoid purchasing items from China. I guess this was my failure to reseach further. I love the color and fabric. The fit is way too small. I typically where a XL in most items made for American women.
1.0,"The out fit is cute, but I did not receive the gray shirt as pictured."
1.0,did not look like the paper
1.0,I thought it would be a linger loose fitting top however it's very boxy and wide :(
1.0,Lousy material and about 2 sizes smaller that advertised. This should be called a spandex shirt.
1.0,The fabric brand new looks like it is already pilling.
1.0,Buena Calidad.<br />Talla equivocada.
1.0,"This product is not the same as the photo. Very thin and the color that is supposed to be blue, looks close to purple. Very cheap looking"
1.0,Fatal cada que metía al bolsillo se desalineaba la goma y un batallar estar acomodando cada ocasión
1.0,"Wish I could give zero stars. Very thin material and the product looks way cheaper in person then on line. Also, looks coral but it's clearly orange. Return policy is terrible as well."
1.0,Much smaller than sizing recommendations suggest
1.0,The stitching along arms and under bust is not elastic and it ripped and then the material started getting runners in it.. I do not recommend this product. Very uncomfortable to have the non stretching border cut into your body.
1.0,VERY Poor quality Fit and packing !!!!<br />returned them all
1.0,This item is 4 sizes to small I’m top heavy so I like to order thing like rompers and I am extremely narrow hipped this thing fits everywhere but hips. Pretty but not a baggy overall. I ordered a XL it was so narrow I had my daughter who wears a XS could we’re it perfectly. Do not get this it’s a whole mess
1.0,Because of the way the drivers license pocket in the middle sits this wallet has actually caused several of my cards to be damaged by being bent around it.
1.0,Both shirts said they were a small but one was very much larger than the other. And the one that was the correct size was coming undone at the collar.
1.0,"Broke as I put it on the first time, but I’m not gonna complain as the price was very cheap oh well you get what you pay for"
1.0,"It was not what I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be a shawl hut it was just a Common scarf, misleading picture also took for ever to get here."
1.0,I'm very unsatisfied with this skit. I washed it before wearing it and now I am unable to wear it because of discoloration. It was a waste of my money. I would like to have my money back please.
1.0,"I am so disappointed with Blowfish.  They used to be THE shoe to get for beauty and comfort.  Unfortunately, they fit too small on me.  As in a full size too small.<br /><br />The worst was the length was short, but the width in the straps were huge.  I couldn’t even adjust them enough.  The hole to tighten it wasn’t punctured enough.  I wasn’t able to attempt to try and walk in them.<br /><br />I recommend for a wide foot, full size up.  They’re pretty, just not for my normal foot."
1.0,"Due to supply chain issues, it took a long time to arrive. Once here, the screen cracked after the first day. We sent it back for a new one. We got a refurbished one, and no power cord. After using another cord to charge, it failed to work. Got a refund, and my daughter pick some art stuff instead."
1.0,"I sized up 3 sizes larger than I am. This costume was made for children. My shoulders are too broad, butt too big, head too big, and bust too big (even though it’s smaller than the displayed measurements range). The only saving grace is the earrings, leg warmers, and head piece."
1.0,"This dress was awful, sent it back.  It had a button you could snap to hide cleavage, but it was super high.  If you unsnap it, then you have a random snap showing."
1.0,"Product is in process of being returned.  When we ordered, the red &#34;stones&#34; in the picture were sparkly and looked as gemstones.  We paid $46 for the earrings, but when we received them, the &#34;stones&#34; were dull, plastic stones and not like the original picture/description.  The price also dropped from $46 when we ordered to $19 when we received them (2 day Prime).  Classic bait and switch."
1.0,The  color and size would be perfect but I 'm unable to wear them as planned because one of the earrings had a broken clasp when I received them.  So disappointing!
1.0,"You only get one necklace with a different picture on each side!!!  Bought for my two nephews, only had one and could not give to either one!!!  Very Disappointed. Picture clearly shows two different necklaces!!!"
1.0,It looks nothing like the photo. It is tiny and the skirt fabric doesn't even go all the way around my waist. I am a size 8. It is also super sheer.  Definitely sending back.
1.0,"It took over a month and a half to arrive, and it was the smallest piece of clothing I’ve ever ordered in my life! It was way too small and it did not look like the picture at all."
1.0,It ran too small.
1.0,Fits only adults. Dont buy these!
1.0,CHEEP CONTAINS LEAD
1.0,"Even if you get a bigger size (ordered a 2xl) it is literally a shirt. It is not even long enough for it to be considered a kimono on a little person. Very Disappointing, would not recommend."
1.0,1st purchase was a perfect hat. This 2nd  Purchased hat seemed to be for a little kid. It's way to small all around and a different brand hat.
1.0,"Very rough material. I expected something much softer.  They are 100% percent cotton, but they are not very soft or comfortably. This is one of the big problems with buying products on line, you can not touch or feel."
1.0,No es color que muestran<br />En la foto
1.0,My daughter is a size 3t so I bought her a size 4. It barley fits her and is so tight.
1.0,Item is adorable but missing hat and scarf. Only came with the dress. Can I get the other pieces?
1.0,Did not like. Will not wear it just looks awful.
1.0,love the earings....but several of them were damaged during shipping. =(
1.0,"The size I chose,  according to the size chart, are not accurate for women who are of a different chest size."
1.0,"Fake item, low res print on a one dollar t-shirt, harsh chemical smell."
1.0,"The weapons are great, just what I wanted. However, my package was missing the set of earrings."
1.0,This is not a jacket it is way to thin!! It won’t even keep you warm in 80 degree weather I am debating sending it back or just donating
1.0,The days came with Chinese latters
1.0,These shoes are great except my husband wore through them in 4 months. Apparently they are not eligible for return
1.0,"Shoes look nice, however one of them only lit for 2 days. The other one is displaying different colors dots when it is supposed to show one single color"
1.0,Do not buy these. I repeat DO NOT BUY THESE they took twice as expected to come and when they finally arrived they were bent and shoved into a box half their size and scuffed to high heaven..very displeased. I hope this can save others from the displeasure and disappointment.
1.0,These run almost 2-3 sizes too small...order size 10-11...they are like a size 8-9
1.0,"I’ve lost every single one of these because they always unscrew, no matter how tight I think I make them."
1.0,Terrible fit for a XL don’t buy
1.0,Product came in the time & condition promised but just doesn’t fit right I made due but but don’t think I’ll be wearing this much brought in a size small but definitely runs big could be im  just extra tiny I’m 5ft2 & about 105 lb
1.0,"I bought this dress in navy last year and loved it. When I ordered this one, I read the description to make sure it was the same style, the description said the dress was lined, just like the one I had previously ordered. That was a key point for me. This dress is NOT lined, the fabric is much cheaper, nothing like the dress I got in the exact same print (but different color) last year. Also the cut is more narrow than the same dress I purchased last year."
1.0,"I have paid lots of money to get my prescription in those glasses that I use every day and after a little more than a year (the warranty) the rubber tip of the side arm disintegrated!<br /><br />They sell replacement for the nose piece but not for the rubber on the side arms, no replacement side arms in sight either!  My only option is to buy another frame and either move my lens to the new frame OR exchange the arms from one frame to the other.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I even purchase an identical frame to use with my lenses or to transfer the arms to my old frames BUT the more recent version of the same model frame is different. The arms do not fit right and the lenses are a slightly different shape!<br /><br />I'm VERY disappointed!<br /><br />I did not buy via Amazon but via Lencrafters."
1.0,"This dress is meant for a youth or a very petite woman. I am 5'9"" and this was a huge miss for me."
1.0,This came missing a clasp straight out of the box. I checked the little bag it came in and the box to look for the missing piece but it wasnt in there so it was shipped clearly broken
1.0,"Thinnest & cheapest material possible, even for the price. let should be sold as a costume piece. Far too short for my 10 yr old who is avg height and thin. Size 10 is too small for her to wear out of the house."
1.0,"Product was very cute, just what we were looking for. However, it would not light up. I changed the batteries and it still would not light up. I returned it"
1.0,"Very cheap, Broke easy, turned color"
1.0,Super small can’t see none of what you see in the picture.
1.0,"What a disappointment! First of all the size is really small, I ordered a size xxl for my daughter who wears size L and it was too tight on the waist and it barely fit on the chest. The material on the top was nice but the lining and tule on the skirt couldn’t be cheaper, looks just like the material used for Halloween costumes.<br />The worst part is that they want it returned to China even though in the package it was sent the address was from NJ, so I will be donating it to goodwill, maybe someone can use it for Halloween."
1.0,"Ordered a size 6 and it doesn’t even fit my 1 year old nephew, so disappointed!"
1.0,Late. Didnt arrive on time. And the clasp dont work<br /><br />Cheap! Will be returning for a refund
1.0,Inside cotton gets on everything & gets in your hair
1.0,They deliver garbage. Seems very cheap and overpriced too. See pics. Highly NOT recommended.
1.0,"Not only runs way too small, the printing is horrible and the fabric is questionable. It costs more to return it than its worth. Thanks Amazon."
1.0,Baggy and shapeless.  I returned it.
1.0,Stamps and stickers did not arrive. 😔
1.0,"The latch mechanism in the buckle broke after I owned it for about 9 months. I'm lowering my rating from 5 stars to 1. Only 6 month warranty on this, and based off other reviews mentioning the same problem, I would NOT buy this belt again. The seller has not made any effort to stand behind their products or respond to any reviews either.<br /><br />I bought a SlideBelt to replace it. Much more expensive, but I'm confident it will last a while.<br /><br />Oh and for anyone who thinks they can buy just the buckle made by SlideBelts and use it with the strap from this one, it won't fit. This strap is just a little too wide. I ordered the buckle first to check, and then ended up ordering the leather strap from them too. I'm very happy with that one though, it is a much better design."
1.0,No color
1.0,We paid express shipping (more than the dress cost) to get the dress 29 days later and when it arrived it fits like a shirt on my daughter. The proportions are ridiculous. If we had ordered larger than it would have been way too wide. And it feels incredibly cheap. This is a wear once outfit.
1.0,They are really nice but way to small
1.0,"Beautiful earrings, unfortunately the backs are cheap so by the conclusion of the event that I wore these two both earrings were MIA.  These earrings are to heavy for the cheap backs that they send with them.  So if you want a beautiful earring and don’t mind utilizing a different back, order them; if you are like me and don’t own a lot of earrings I would continue to shop for something of better quality."
1.0,Draft board was missing running backs page last names letters m through z.  Had the 6th round after the 9th.  Not good.
1.0,from china not american size
1.0,"Great product if you like a one time wear....... I bought 5 different shirts from this vendor in Venice beach & paid $24-36 for each shirt & every one has ruined after 1 gentle wash & hang dry.<br />The gold wears off to dull & it sticks to itself.<br />I don’t use harsh soaps (all natural)<br />So my only suggestion is that whatever ink they use is only good for HAND WASH?  Not sure but the gold doesn’t last 😢<br />Sad as I spent $150 on 5<br />Fabric is BOMB, gold SUCKS"
1.0,"This watch is shown upside down. I want a watch I can look down on & tell the time, not so I can wear & everyone else who looks at it can tell the time. Very deceptive. I am so angry right now, I threw it away in the garbage. Not that I cannot tell the time upside down, but it is the principle of the thing. I am a nurse who has worn watches like this clipped to my clothing or the back of my namebadge. It is totally useless if I cannot look down on it & quickly tell the time."
1.0,I did not like these personally. They are super shiny and not a true gold color. They are way overpriced for what they are. Not a good buy.
1.0,My daughter has been wearing this shoes for a month and they are already peeling from the front.
1.0,I'm afraid to put it on. It's stained and dirty right out of the package.  GROSS. I don't want to have to wear the damned thing anyway!
1.0,me gustaria hablar directamente con el vendedor; el producto llego tarde y la calidad no fue la mejor; mi hijo se lo ha puesto ayer y se le rompio todo el pantalon
1.0,Broke a week after we got it. The other two we purchased elsewhere have held up great!
1.0,Stone in the middle came glued on crooked with excess glue seeping out from underneath it. It was absolutely horrible and cheap looking.
1.0,Very very cheap cheap looking and feeling. These are extremely small for the price. I can't even use them for groceries
1.0,"I dislike it, when you wear it it fogs up"
1.0,"They are advertised as being used for earrings, but in a regular ear hole piercing they are much too large to fit thru the hole."
1.0,Didn't fit me at all
1.0,Can I get replacements the product leaked everywhere. Thanks
1.0,"Not a true bifocal, they are magnified across the full lense. I do like the style, misleading title."
1.0,Very roomy and sufficient pockets.  While out and about to retrieve an item from handbag is very awkward. You have to find something to set it on to retrieve an item. I am no longer carrying this handbag.
1.0,They don’t stay on your collars Worth a damn. Do not purchase.
1.0,I liked the color but clips were cheap and fell off. Too small and fragile like you would find on a baby necklace.
1.0,"I am a 36DD and purchased an XL. These bras are comfortable as lounge wear, but provide absolutely NO support- you can not wear these to the gym!!  Even walking around I bounce in these bras. I would not recommend these bras for anyone needing support!"
1.0,I received a gray knit dress instead of this cute denim one. I’m so disappointed because I had plans to wear the denim dress to a party.
1.0,Too tight. Fits weird. Top pokes up and looks ridiculous. Tag looks lame on it.
1.0,"I was stoked on this jacket when it first arrived, but after wearing it out one I noticed that the button on one of the sleeves was entirely missing. Not only was it not there, but there was no hole indicating that there was ever a button there. It was just simply never made with a button. Now I don't even want to wear it, as the sleeve hangs awkwardly and gets in the way. This is super disappointing and I wish I could return it but I already washed it so not sure."
1.0,This is junk. The logo is plastic and doesn't fit right.
1.0,"Pretty low quality, but you get what you pay for. Fell apart as soon as we took it out of the packaging."
1.0,I did like the quality of the boots they are extremely cute but tgey was way to small and ripped
1.0,Don't waste your money and buy this crap. I bought a 2xl and it's very tight.
1.0,I've never had socks that couldn't fit unless they were women's or children's socks.<br /><br />Bought these for a trip and haven't been able to wear them. If I try to force them on I'd surely rip them.
1.0,"This nose ring isn't worth a quarter, it's missing a piece ,the diamond is bent ,don't waste your money"
1.0,"I typically wear a small in shirts and either a 4 or 6 in womens pants. I do have a larger chest (32ddd) so I ordered a large, which usually fits me well. I like a little more coverage on my bottom too, and again usually a large is perfect. The bottoms were tiny! They also bunch up at the backside so it looks like a full diaper. The top fit more like a small, and had pre molded cups that did not sit well at all. It also did not seem well made, but for $10 I didn’t expect it to last past this summer. Just very disappointed with it being so small. I couldn’t imagine what the small would be like."
1.0,I follows the chart and outs was to big need a smaller size
1.0,Cheap don't bother
1.0,"I was expecting a true yellow, but the color is a very unflattering mustard-ish color that does not work with my complexion. I plan on returning it.  The quality is fair."
1.0,"I would not be surprised to discover that the majority of reviews about this watch are fake. This is a typical case of 'you get what you pay for.' I didn't expect a top notch watch- given the price I just wanted something to wear as a temporary fashion accessory depending on my outfit. Unfortunately, I had to return this watch after having it for ONE day. The fastener that held the watch on my wrist would not stay on for more than 10 minutes. Please stay farrr away from this product - I'm eagerly awaiting my refund"
1.0,"The front was huge and the pockets were set back too far.  I guess if you have a narrow back, shoulders set way back and huge boobs, you’d be ok."
1.0,Necklace change color after one wear
1.0,"Cheap, thin stretch material.  Costumes bought off Amazon are always trash.  Go to spirit Halloween"
1.0,"This sweater is cheaply made, not worth the price! Just got this pulled it out to find out it is a crop type sweater. That’s not what was advertised and not what I wanted for my 8year old also I ordered a 9-10 just to be safe and it is really small"
1.0,"Cheap, I was looking for a sweater like this for a while, the neck stretches out very easy.. looks floppy and strange. I haven’t washed it, wore it two times and it is very pilled. Keep looking!!"
1.0,"Necklace didn't even leave the packaging and tarnished...just purchased to wear once, very cheap..get what you pay for..didn't even get to wear it that one time"
1.0,I received a damaged dress.my daughter was eagerly waiting for her dress but there is no way she can wear it as there is something glued to it and has a hole on the net 😞😞<br />I will be returning the dress..meg👎
1.0,Do not buy this.  It continues to fall apart.
1.0,The bill was sewn on crooked and fits lopsided.
1.0,Don't even think about ordering this suit unless you are a size 2 with less than an  A Cup chest size. Absolutely no support.
1.0,The arms were way too tight compared to the photo with more flowy sleeves. The body was very long and went to my knees. The body was also a little larger than I thought it would be. The particular dress I got had a huge rip in the sleeve’s lace as well so I returned it.
1.0,"I bought one and was very happy with my purchase until one day it fell, I noticed that the band broke in a &#34;ceramic like&#34; manner, so I took one of the links out and dropped it. I broke in 3 pieces. I was very disappointed as the watch is very beautiful, but the band is not metal, it is some cosmetic material or ceramic. Do not waste you cash on this. THIS PRODUCT IS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!."
1.0,Cheap material and sewing quality. What did I expect for the price?? I couldn't even wear this dress and was too lazy to return it so I'm giving it away. Don't buy it.
1.0,Received this July 8th. Strap snapped on July 20th. Wore this two times. Absolute garbage... that's where it ended up
1.0,The clips don’t hold enough I’m not happy with the product
1.0,Read the reviews and was aware that they ran small so I ordered a larger size. Still too small and quality is poor to say the least. . Don't waste your money!
1.0,The tees were way too small. Ordered a larger size than usual and it fit like a children's tee
1.0,Bought the rose gold ring and was disappointed in the color. It does not match the picture displayed and appears more gold than anything else.
1.0,I bought these shoes in black yesturday and wore them to work today for the first time.  After four hours of wear (one of which was in my car on the commute to work and two sitting at my desk) the heel came off when I got up to go to my co-worker's desk.  It was beyond embarrassing.  I now have to spend the rest of the day sitting at my desk or walking without my heel (thank goodness my pants are long enough that it isnt completely obvious that I do not have a heel on one foot.  I am not looking forward to driving home in them.<br /><br />I would not recommend purchasing anything from this company.  I contacted their customer service department and they keep asking me to provide more information to include pictures of the shoes and a copy of the receipt (which I do not know if I have since I was not planning on having to return them since they fit so well in the store).  I am about to just cut my losses and never buy this brand of shoe again.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you choose between this shoe and another which would probably be a better choice.
1.0,Accesorio defectuoso.sin garantía ni respuesta por parte del vendedor ni la página
1.0,They are pretty but not rose gold. Now I either have to keep earrings I didn't want or go through the hassle of a return. Frustrated!
1.0,"Cheap material, sleeves showed 3/4 in picture but they were SHORT.  My sister also ordered a dress from here and hers was equally disappointing.  Would NOT recommend."
1.0,i see no shiny stuff on it. no glitter not as described
1.0,It is ugly and looks cheap. Would like to return it but have no return address
1.0,big downer
1.0,Purchased this watch band recently.  Looks nice but missing the spring bar pins that are listed as included in the description.  I don't want to spend additional money to buy the pins so I had to return it.
1.0,A month in only half of one shoe works!
1.0,Color and material not as pictured- not t shirt material it’s something heavy and non breathable. Also came very oversized with a weird fit.
1.0,"I had to return this blouse, which is too bad because it was very pretty. Although I carefully followed the sizing directions and then bought a size larger, the blouse was still tight across the bust and short bodied.  I rather think it was Asian sizing, which doesn't fit our more - um - robust figures."
1.0,These were a huge disappointment. They lasted for an hour and then nothing.  Laces are cheap
1.0,I have nursemate compression socks 12-14 and these do NOT help the swelling and fatigue after a 13 hour hospital shift.  Compressions socks will make a bad day tolerable.  I swear by my compression socks and after wearing these socks I had about 2+ edema and my Rt knee was hurting so badly by the end of my shift I couldn’t wait to get home to put ice on it.  As soon as I put the socks on in the morning they were much easier than my regular compression socks.  The colors are vibrant and bright is a positive.  These socks are absolutely worthless to me.  The package said nurse mate so I’m not sure what the difference is.  Maybe this pair is for a larger leg and calf...
1.0,No indication anywhere this is organic cotton. Too small for a 22 month old. Returning.<br />Otherwise cute.
1.0,very bad plastic material
1.0,"Very poor quality, poor fit. Unable to wear, will be returning these ear muffs."
1.0,The wig was not completely attached to the mask
1.0,These glasses look cheap....Not worth $9.95 very disappointed
1.0,Arrived with second hand broke off inside watch. Two days later fell off my arm. Terrible.
1.0,These are well-made and we may be good for something. But I wanted it for Covid protection for travel and it just doesn't cut it. My glasses don't fit in well it's bulky and uncomfortable
1.0,Cheaply made. Zipper broke w in 4 days
1.0,A Youth XL is closer to a Youth Medium.
1.0,The package was empty when it arrived.
1.0,These slippers were so poorly made that we could not even use them. They felt like they were made out of paper and cardboard.
1.0,"Ordered both black and brown bands.  Able to secure both bands around my wrist without problem; however, within a minute of wear, both bands released on the upper point of contact (side of the “top” of the watch).  The silicone bands I already have stay affixed securely.  Disappointed as I would prefer a leather band."
1.0,They are blue ND NOT PINK and purple. Will give to her to see if she likes  not sure she will though!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:425fe81280f63e5707a1d09507b56733]] Dislike the quality because soon as the wife start wearing it. Started to fall apart
1.0,Junk don't wast tume
1.0,"The sizes are way off on these. I always purchase baggy clothes, so a 2XL always fits. But these sweat pants were tight around the waist and it dug into me, I just couldn't wear them. Had to throw away. What a shame, the fabric is nice. But I would say at least 2 sizes too small."
1.0,Cancelled order cuz they are stupid junk jewelry. Ordered by my granddaughter.l
1.0,Very cheap material. They broke after wearing 2 times as if they were panties hose. Do not buy them. Nice aspect but that is all.
1.0,This product was horrible do you not buy it it looks like Grandma pants they fit horribly they look nothing like the picture and they are not a good material at all
1.0,"These were a very uncomfortable fabric, I did not like the top of the pants either"
1.0,I got a small and it is huge. This hits like any ol free shirt I have been given. It is not cute at all. I will never wear it.
1.0,They do NOT stop your shoes from getting creased and they hurt your toes!
1.0,The pendant is beautiful but the silver chain turned black in places within days. I tried to wash and clean it but it remained black.
1.0,Turned colors after one week! This is a cute ring if you are getting it for a young girl.
1.0,The little crystals have begun to fall out of all three charms.  Now I would chalk it up to my wife banging her hair on things however she is an office employee that sits at a desk and she is very careful
1.0,"I'm a bigger guy so I got a 3x as that's the size I wear, HOWEVER, the 3x is literally an XL. I wasn't able to pull it over my shoulders. That's how small it is. Printing isn't exactly sharp, a bit fuzzy, but it's the sizes that will bite you!! Order 2 sizes up!!!"
1.0,"Worst hoodie I have ever bought. Fit is terrible, extremely huge in the shoulders, smaller at the waist. Also, I didn't pay attention but this is 100% polyester. There's no movement with the hoodie because it sticks to your clothes underneath."
1.0,These are really cute and my daughter loved them but broke literally the first one she wore to school and they just keep breaking. The elastic just wears out and snaps and the clasps fall off. Waste of money and now I have to find something else to get for her.
1.0,Super cute design. Super poor quality! Arrived with the elastic (part holding up the dress) all distorted like it had been through a dryer and shrunk. There was no elasticity. Looked like someone wore it and returned!
1.0,model looks nice  but blurry waste of money must my return window
1.0,"If I could negative stars I would. The fit was waaay off, this fit like a junior or even a child’s shirt. The material was rough. Not worth it at all. Luckily I found a really petite sorority sister to gift it to."
1.0,The pants are not tampered how it shows in the picture.
1.0,"LOL, who are these for? All I wanted was a couple of hoop nose rings. I’m still waiting for the punchline"
1.0,Only came with one necklace<br />Description says 2!
1.0,Unfortunately I was told these pieces are glass. Not real Moldavite.
1.0,Slipped rightmost my foot and was damaged. Easy to return though.
1.0,Wasn't worth purchasing. Didn't even fit around my neck.
1.0,Almost paper thin. Fell apart i the washer. Do not recommend.
1.0,"I purchased this ring because of the overall 5 star review rating. I am very hesitant to rate anything poorly, but the ring that we received chipped on its first day on my finger. It fit and felt great but the durability was so poor that it was unwearable after its first day. I did not wear the ring to the gym, construction or anything strenuous nor physical yet it was chipped and scratched from its first use.<br /><br />I put that ring where it belonged: in the trash and bought a different ring. At least I only wasted $20."
1.0,I get this type glasses for 1/3 the cost typically
1.0,need to return it now
1.0,"I ordered a medium and received a xxxL. The medium was too big, not Asian or American sizes . Disappointing too because I like how it fits the model in the main picture!"
1.0,"One star because you can’t leave zero. Poor, cheap plastic. Not a formed metal, but a printed on plastic that is so pixelated, it is blurry. Not going to do Santa any good."
1.0,My daughter bought them and love the way they look. They got lost in the mail and then randomly showed up one day. Some of the gems were displaced on it and they broke after 2 uses. Glad we were refunded when lost. I would not buy them.
1.0,looks nothing like the picture. does not fit like model.
1.0,"My wife did not care for them, so they were returned."
1.0,Band is bright and shiny not brushed as pictured
1.0,The band snags on all my clothes . Buy the real Apple band
1.0,"Do not buy! These are a complete waste of money, and two of my three daughters’ necklaces broke the same day they received them. These are junk."
1.0,Pearl was on the big side for my daughters taste (15). Wrinkles easy.
1.0,"I will say these are very cute earrings, however not worth $6. They are very cheaply made, one of the posts of the earring arrived severely bent. They will not last long before breaking. Could probably find better quality earrings at the Dollar Tree."
1.0,"This is so cute! Based on the one time I was able to wear it, very comfortable. Unfortunately, after wearing it one time the zipper broke. It is very disappointing."
1.0,It runs small. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She always wears a 5 and so do I. Neither of us could get it on our finger!  I'm extremely upset that it ruined her day!  It's also very thin. Much thinner than it looks in the pic.
1.0,"I LOVED this swimsuit!  I ordered a large (I generally wear a size 12) It fit really great!  After washing, it doesn't fit any more!  It has completely stretched out and is ruined.  So sad!"
1.0,"Extremely clingly. Even after multiple washes and hang drying, it is always full of static."
1.0,"I was excited about these since they had a 4 prong setting unlike a lot of other stainless steel earrings on Amazon, even though they’re about double the price. The listing says they are durable and will not bend. Unfortunately the posts are soldered on crookedly so the earrings do not sit right, and the posts arrived bent. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,This literally broke apart after 3 uses. What a waste of money
1.0,The XL in this couldn't fit an average three year old n material is ultra thin n transparent.........very poor quality
1.0,"The sweater is described as being ""chunky"" which indicates to me it should be of heavy and good quality.  When I got it, the sweater is VERY lightweight and very thin.  I felt it was of poor quality and sent it back."
1.0,"The dress I received had FOOD stuck to the front of it, and food stains. If you look at the pictures, you can see yellow liquid type stains as well as something crusty stuck to the dress. It also smelled awful, like it had been left in a washing machine too long.<br />I can’t comment on the fit as there was no way I was going to try it on.<br />I would give zero stars but I had to give one to write a review."
1.0,"Thin material,  not sewn as pictured , neck line not as wide as supposed to be,  and the shirt runs very small.  Not worth the money I spent."
1.0,Ordered 9 of these for our wedding.  I’m not going to open them all but the first 4 are all horribly tarnished.  Not shiny at all. Very disappointed!!
1.0,"I'm not sure whose planet their version of an XL is, but it's not mine, I've had to give them away to a friend who's a true medium - small. Very disappointing."
1.0,The only thing about this top that was consistent with the description and picture is the color. It is poorly made and does not have the same structure or appearance at all
1.0,"I did not like it, it was just a face mask with extra material hanging down not what I was looking for"
1.0,Not worth it changes very quickly
1.0,Broke the next day after I gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas
1.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous but you won’t be able to wear it more than once, if at all. The entire thing is so cheaply made. The top is so heavy, you will have to hold both the top and the bottom of the dress UP the entire time. It arrived with pulls in the material, dirt on the bottom of it, the bra strap even sat ABOVE the back of the dress. Not sure if it was altered before it got sent to me or something but the craftsmanship was extremely disappointing!!!"
1.0,They were beautiful but they broke and no watch maker could fix them. Terribly disappointed.
1.0,Not soft at all and not good quality. Definitely not worth the price
1.0,"These are very thin and look really cheap. I have purchased other cufflinks for under $10 that are better quality.<br /><br />Update, I wore them for the first time and the cross bones broke."
1.0,Cheaply made terribly sized one piece
1.0,I bought this because of the swans......the workmanship on this necklace is awful.  The jewels are out of the backing half-way and the glue is showing.  Should have known better but the picture was beautiful.
1.0,It broke within a day of wearing it. Contacted the company and NO response. (One star is too much but they don't give you an option of negative stars!)
1.0,The quality of material and sewing was TERRIBLE!
1.0,The bottom came completely detached from the top after a month of light to moderate use.
1.0,They ripped after a month only wore a few times
1.0,"The hole to put your eyeglass stem through is TINY.  There is no way this fits most glasses.  Unfortunately, I missed the return window.  DO NOT RECOMMEND."
1.0,Ties were too narrow.  Returning.
1.0,Terrible terrible terrible. They aren't sewn properly so there is no place for the heel. So the boot slips off instantly. Two pairs and both were the same.
1.0,ordered a Large more like a small way too small but nice material
1.0,Too sma
1.0,Seams have split open after 3 days of light wearing. Arch support is gone after 2 weeks.
1.0,"Extremely cheaply made, and does not even come close to the size indicated on the website.  If you're a small, you will want to order an XXL.  If you're over a size Large, don't even attempt to order this.  And no, I'm actually not kidding."
1.0,Frames are shaped oddly
1.0,Cute idea but very poor quality.  I would not order again.
1.0,"way too small, even for a baby"
1.0,"I returned it.  It felt like plastic.  The seams were pulling apart.  I understand at this price point that I can't expect much, but this was not wearable in public.  The cut is super cute!"
1.0,"These sandals are very pretty and y daughter loved them.  Unfortunately, the ankle strap broke after 6 weeks.  She wore them to / from school (changed into tennis shoes at school to play) and didn’t wear them everyday.  Very disappointed and can not recommend,"
1.0,"I thought I was purchasing 3 pairs as the photos show and the same link in other colors came with 3 pairs, however this was only for 1 pair!"
1.0,It falls off my wrist easy. It’s meant for bigger wrists I have small wrists so it didn’t work out for me.
1.0,I’m really sad that the zipper broke the second time I wore these. I can’t seem to fix it either. These are so cute and I was really looking forward to wearing them this summer. And it’s too late to return 😭
1.0,Too small for all of my sunglasses
1.0,The fit was so bad. It fit like a trash bag. The waist was cut way too low and the small size still fit huge.
1.0,"I was in love with them and how soft they were but realized after only wearing them a few hours the day i got them, the fabric started coming loose on the bottom. save yourself the money and buy some $10 ones from walmart or smth"
1.0,After a couple of wears the birthstone fell off.
1.0,"I bought this pants for my brother, which were expensive more than 50 dollars and they came ripped on the bottom!!! I think this is NOT acceptable, I can't return it back cause I'm send it to another country next week with my Dad so it's impossible to return it, but for sure is the last time buying here these kind of things."
1.0,Disappointed because the one bar I wanted has a very small ball on it that goes through my tongue I almost swallowed it!!!! The other one I couldn't get ball off of and other one is making my tongue sore.
1.0,These stuck to my skin and were not easy to get on.  They were too snug through the hips and then baggy through the lower thighs on down.  The cut is just wrong.  Returned them.
1.0,not a us adult  medium. just barely a child medium  probably a knock off and not a licensed product. do not buy
1.0,"Unfortunately it was a great disappointment because I did not know it was completely Styrofoam, ax head is greatly smaller in comparison to the ax handle and definitely did not get the keychain"
1.0,I normally wear a large in sweatshirts but this item was extremely tight and did not fit properly.  It appears that this product runs small and does not fit properly.
1.0,Not what it looked like
1.0,When I received the watch it did not work.  I took it to someone to check the battery and it was dead.  Had to get a new battery right away.
1.0,This was a disastrous gift I gave to a family member. I am so disappointed with this particular purchase and it's going to be returned!!
1.0,Do not throw your money away...<br />Had the ring for (1) week.<br />It's a $2.00 ring that you might find<br />at a flea Market.
1.0,"Dress was an extremely stretchy material, but VERY tight! I even bought the dress one size up. Not a happy purchase."
1.0,One of the caps has a hole in the back.
1.0,Ordered their belt that is advertised size 30-43.  Attached the latch (without trimming down the size at all). Measured the length. It's the same length as my 40 belt.  Written into the belt is 44. Too bad this company doesn't understand numbers.
1.0,They unraveled after having them on for only a few minutes.
1.0,"The product works, but I’ve ordered two and they are no where close to the color it shows. This one shows and calls it silver, but it was white on the part that attaches and a very light grey on the band."
1.0,Fabric under looks cheap
1.0,Too small and the back is not secure at all
1.0,"I really didn't like the bag, I'm returning. Cumbersome, not comfortable and really not up to date in style."
1.0,Looks like painted plastic ....
1.0,absolutely the worst product i’ve bought on amazon. didn’t even come !
1.0,Terrible fit! Gave specific measurements and STILL had to spend hours making adjustments!!!
1.0,Bought this for my wife for Christmas and it's been lightly used for less than two months.  The strap recently broke and cannot be repaired (and she can usually repair about anything).
1.0,Looks ate decieving
1.0,Had 4 holes in butt after only wearing them for 3 hours.
1.0,I just thought they looked ugly on me. But if you’re into them they could be cool.
1.0,it broke soon after recieving
1.0,Bought for reminder of trip to the Florida keys on our anniversary and as a gift for Mother's Day my wife loved it at first but 3 days later started turning colors she is verry upset with gift and wood not give it no stars
1.0,"I really loved this bracelet  but it would not stay on! If I'd kept it, I would've lost it, so I returned it sadly."
1.0,"These were described as crew socks. There is no way these are crew socks. The fabric is flimsy, I am returning them even though a got a great deal.  Not even worth that."
1.0,"Bought the regular size I wear (SMALL) and it fit nothing like the picture--it was short, clingy and not relaxed as the picture shows.  Returned the item."
1.0,They were hard/impossible to get in with the blunt back 10/10 would not buy again
1.0,"Unfortunately I tried to like these, but that attempt only left me disappointed and too far past the window to return them. The bands are very easy to put on so I was impressed however they are not secure at all. Everyday tasks causing them to pop right off. I even lost (and later found) my watch from the band getting snagged by my laundry. Lastly, I keep having an allergic reaction to the bands. I broke out in bumps in the exact pattern of the watch."
1.0,The L on the post is too short to fit through the piercing properly.
1.0,"I received 2 right ear pieces, instead of one for each ear. The earrings are not as delicate as they appear. Mine were not molded well. you can see where there is excess metal is behind and around the sides. Very disappointed."
1.0,Received the top with 3 inch tear in the seam.  The bottom is unraveling and the size/fit does not correspond to the size chart. Would like a replacement in a M.
1.0,"too big, the center stone looks really fake"
1.0,"Im a woman with a thin neck , could barely get this over my head and when i did - i felt like i was being strangled.  Waaaay too tight.  No stretch -none.  Nice fabric but not suitable for this design.  Im cutting it open to use for something else.  Sad"
1.0,Nylon Print is not vibrant
1.0,"Wasting money,doesen't work"
1.0,The lines on the butt aren’t even right looked so weird coming from a person with a booty
1.0,Dnt like the they each have different color
1.0,Did not look like the picture or fit well.
1.0,These masks have a wide strip of white at the top--the design does NOT go all the way to the edge as shown in the false photos.  I returned the masks.
1.0,"Don’t buy them, unless you want your little one to get hurt. It says texture sole but really it’s all smooth sole. There’s no grip on them."
1.0,"I should have read the description, the material is shiny, and it’s very thin"
1.0,"This item is garbage. After wearing for less than 2 weeks, my neck turned green with the residue of cheap quarter machine metal."
1.0,This runs so small. I was very disappointed
1.0,I order Hanes briefs all the time but this time the same size were smaller and very scratchy.These were made in El Salvador not Viet Nam or Thailand like the nice softer Hanes briefs I've ordered in the past. Very disappointing.
1.0,"This comes in 2 pieces, hat then shield ties around head on top of hat. Shield shifts constantly because its not attached as one unit or one piece. Not ideal for a child under 5."
1.0,Way too small returning it
1.0,"Have had less than a month and totally regret getting them. The string in the back was pointless. Mine kept coming untied, even double knotted, so I removed them. Just not good."
1.0,Didn’t help my plantar fasciitis made my feet hurt
1.0,The velcro snap is torn off and you cannot keep the shoe on. My granddaughter was so excited with the red glitter she was upset that they are not usable. I am trying to fix it because she loved the shoe so much. However if the strap cannot be closed they are worthless.
1.0,It broke after 2 weeks of wear. So sad
1.0,The holes where too small for the any of the earrings that I tried to use them with.  I have return as I cannot use.
1.0,The enamel was all peeling off before I even took it out of the package!  It also looks like the ring was crushed.
1.0,"Upon use, my skin erupted into various shades of green and purple. Buyer beware."
1.0,"ordered a XLso it would be loose.  It barely fit my 11 year old daughter, who is slight for her age."
1.0,"Bought 2 sizes larger than I wear and these shorts are off by 3 sizes, they run extremely SMALL!!"
1.0,Not true to size upset bc it was a Christmas gift.
1.0,"Initial thought was a great purchase.  But, 5 days later the strap and clasp broke.  Not very good quality."
1.0,"I loved this watch, but I dropped it once and the crystal shattered.  It was cheaper to buy a new one than to have the crystal replaced.  It only lasted a few weeks."
1.0,Zipper is CHEAP!  I can hardly get it to zip as it seems to catch... like it is going to break any second.  The button hole is TOO SMALL FOR THE BUTTON!  Can barely button it.  Why have a button and zipper if it is supposed to be a zip on?  Plus the package warns you not to wear it with white underwear or sit on light colored upholstery because the colors will run.  I sent it back immediately.
1.0,"These glasses do NOT filter any blue light, zero."
1.0,I received my package with the box being very bent out of shape which caused the hat to crease pretty badly. The hat was too small.
1.0,As soon as my son went to use it the chain part broke off the charm. Wish I could give it 0 stars
1.0,The image shows that both balls can be unscrewed. Only one can be taken out.
1.0,Very cheap looking. Nothing to do with the pretty picture.
1.0,No es lo q se muestra
1.0,"I am not sure if the product I got was fake. The look is just like saucony shoes my son already owns but these shoes are in a terrible shape after being worn 15-20 times to school, the grip below the sole is also all worn off. I am convinced the product is fake. The 1 year old similar looking shoes look newer than the new ones."
1.0,This suit fit bit it was not at all what I expected.  The top was much skimpier than what is shown on the image.
1.0,"Very low quality toy, not recommended."
1.0,"This military style poncho jacket is the strangest cut jacket I have ever put on!  I ordered the large, thinking it would be roomy, and I could not get the top part around me, but the bottom area was like a horse blanket.  I actually thought maybe I put it on wrong at first, and even though it has the poncho look, it is not a true poncho.  The arms are not as pictured, it is like they are sewn forward and it made me have t-rex arms!  The buttons are cheap looking and the fabric arrived with fuzzies on it. Sorry Jessica, this jacket is an epic fail, it was returned!"
1.0,"This dress is  way to small, Try to return it but  received an email that stated it would cost me too much money to return dress to China.<br />Now, I'm stuck with a dress that I cannot fit. Also, I ordeded this dress two sizes bigger.<br />Very disappointed!!!"
1.0,Shrinkage out of control even when washed in twrpersbt water and air dried
1.0,It was a regular tigers eye not a blue tigers eye so i gave it to my bf he wanted it plz know your stones i was dissapointed
1.0,I legit was sent a dress that is NOT the dress in the advertisement that I ordered. It’s like one of those “China Knock offs” where you see a beautiful dress and then when it arrives you have a WTF is this moment. Returning this hideous thing immediately. The pattern looks like one that would be on children’s clothing....very “kid-ish”. Please take photos of the actual product you are selling and not a “dupe”!
1.0,"Not as described, cotton canvas."
1.0,Very frustrated. These were delivered today and  came with a huge black spot on the back of one of the earrings. I have no idea what it is
1.0,Looked nothing like the photo! Returned
1.0,Save your $ this is poorly made and very tiny
1.0,"These pants are to short! The Large and Xl sizing chart states over 30” inseam.<br /> Also, they stink!<br />Disappointed!!!"
1.0,First they sent me children's side laces and then replaced them with adult size. So that part of the sale was finally OK. But their no-tie shoelaces are next to impossible to put in the shoe holes. The first part of this brand I bought a while ago came with a small metal piece that slid the ends through the holes. These did not and they say the don't have such a device at present. Not going to help me. I'll never buy another product from them.
1.0,It broke at the first use in pants groin aeria .
1.0,Arrived with stone missing. Also the metal is warped. It says surgical steel but the look of the quality says it can't possibly be.<br />Very disappointed. Needed this for an event in 2 weeks.
1.0,Way to big for my daughter
1.0,"Item returned, it was scratchy as it was for a college student a a gift, she was not impressed with the item"
1.0,Fit too small donated to a thrift store after dealing with return hassles.
1.0,"These shoes DO NOT have a velcro strap. If you are needing Velcro, the description in inaccurate. Returning."
1.0,The bag looks extremely small and completely different than it shows here. The seller never answered on my request to return this item.
1.0,This is the 2nd pair I bought. Toddle 6 to 12 M
1.0,"I really wanted these to work. I wore them for a day hoping that the discomfort would ease, but it never did and I ended up with irritated ears."
1.0,Not happy pants ripped after a days of wearing
1.0,broke while putting them on
1.0,"These are adult socks, but dont fit. Not even a little. Can not get them over my heel.<br />I gave them to my 11 year old son, they dont fit him either. Same issue, cant get them over his heel. Who are these supposed to fit?<br />They arnt very well made either. Cheap craftsmanship"
1.0,Not an accurate fit. At least 2 sizes smaller than stated.
1.0,"I'll start with the one, and only, positive. It's a nice looking watch. There. Done with the positives. I'm fairly knowledgeable about watches, and knew full well that I was paying more than it really should be worth, but I'd long been fairly captivated by its looks, and I like watches with a moon function. Well, it barely works. Automatic watches have a device to keep it from getting over-wound when they are being worn. This one kicks in way too early, and you can usually get only 45 minutes to an hour of running time. Try to wind it any more than that, and you hear the ""click"" of the spring being released, and it ""dies"" a minute or two later. It even dies while being worn, and I'm up and moving about. This is unacceptable for any watch, and simply unbelievable for a watch they are charging this much for. (I got it on Black Friday for 20% off the normal price, but that's still WAY too much money for something this poorly made.) A shame, because it keeps decent time during the rare moments I can keep it running for a day, and the moon function doesn't seem to drift, although it's been barely over a month of watching that."
1.0,"This is not a 14K gold ring, it may be "" rose gold"" color. But I get better quality rings in a gumball machine, cheap material, you can see so many imperfections. Would not recommend and buy again!!!"
1.0,Completely see-through. Would not recommend
1.0,These socks don’t fit anyone in my family! They say they are men’s but my 10 year old son can’t even pull them over his heel.  I added a photo to show how far it goes on my sons foot.
1.0,"This was pretty cheap, one of the bands wasn’t the same color all around, which wouldn’t be a problem but the discolored part was the part that showed. And they bands were not the same length, I will be returning them soon"
1.0,Poor quality fabric. Sent back immediately and didn’t receive refund.
1.0,Very small and they got my ears infected and so much pain they caused me. Bad purchase to me
1.0,Have purchased two and both have broken just from normal wear. Upsetting because I love the look and fit.
1.0,Way too small for the average adult head
1.0,The dress part was ok but the slit is ridiculously short. If I walked it came up and you could see my underwear.
1.0,Just awful.  I kept it though.  Maybe one day may use it for part of a Halloween costume.  Same material those are made from.
1.0,It broke the first time he tried to put them on. Good bad because they do look amazing.
1.0,"There's nothing wrong with the gloves, they were just hideous in person and felt thin and flimsy to the touch. Would recommend for if it's a little chilly out and you're pumping gas but that's about it."
1.0,Hate it don't waste your money wrong size does not fit right no support. Will not let me return  this piece of useless crap
1.0,Size chart said small was for small kids it was an adult sock mis represented!
1.0,The fabric is noisy and scratchy. The shoulders wouldn't stay up and wanted to hang off onto the arms.  The color was more rusty than burnt orange.  It was all just a hot-mess for me and there was no way It would work.
1.0,Horrible. Arm holes were nothing like the picture.  Thin fabric. Not form fitting. So horrible that I returned the item.
1.0,It doesn't  work.  I followed directions very exactly.  It doesn't work.
1.0,I purchused a 2x thinking to get it a little on the lrger size. It barely fits my 12 year old niece who wars an xs. do not buy!
1.0,I am a 16 to 18 I got the 3x wouldn't even get over my head or arms very dissatisfied with this this would fit my 10 year old niece very upset about this
1.0,It is not strong umbrella. It folds back very easily even on slightest wind. Absolutely useless in the windy time. Disappointed purchase.
1.0,Too much fabric. Way too big
1.0,It’s not my  product  i did not receive my order wrong packages I ordered 2  chance the rapper hats 1 black 1 red and I receive a black military hat
1.0,Very concerning. This is a product for children.
1.0,I ordered a 7-8 they sent me a large. Way to big . I also got a 10-12 in among us way to big. They are the same size. NOT A 7-8. Tired of returning things.
1.0,Not refundable!! Terrible.<br />Prongs bent cheap cheap cheap<br />Should cost $1.00
1.0,Product is extremely poor quality. I received the item with loose stitching throughout especially on the sleeves. No use to me and it was never worn. Now outside the return window! Add 40 bucks more and get a decent cardigan. Lesson learnt.
1.0,"I really like the scarf, but I thought I was getting a grey scarf and the one I got is more of a. light purple.  I am disappointed, I needed it for family pictures and it clearly is not grey."
1.0,"I am very disappointed in this product. I read the reviews but decided to get it anyways, bad idea. It looks like it is very cheap made and it didn't even fit my cell phone. Unfortunately, I returned it the next day. I really wish this product could've turned out the way I wanted it to."
1.0,Not my favorite. They are 3/4 length not full length. Sheer
1.0,"Zoomies are the equivalent of those X-Ray vision glasses you may have seen in comic books.  The commercial you've seen for this product is ludicrous to say the least!  For starters they are very flimsy and cheaply made, beyond that they only make the object appear about 12 inches closer!  Imagine holding a magnifying glass and extending your hand closer and further.  We actually died laughing - after we got over the fury of blowing $25 - yes $25!  They advertise $10 but then they charge a fortune for the shipping and handling - which is non refundable fyi.  Bottom line - do not waste your time on this!"
1.0,I opened the box and they were already tarnished on the post. I haven't even wore them yet . But since I used my Amazon credit I can't return for a refund unfortunately.
1.0,This is a Rolex Milgauss homage NOT an Explorer homage
1.0,I received one float.  The mesh and inflatable material is very thin.  I have not inflated it yet so I do not know if it leaks.  I doubt it would hold an adult up without the side pieces.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,Was very disappointed and material was like a nylon material the inside does not have any print it’s just white. Try to return the product it’s so far they have not excepted my return
1.0,The shirt is very thin and a silky like material it’s not what I expected at all... looks very cheap

1.0,Arms are so tight you can’t wear it
1.0,Missing pin to hold it together.  Wouldnt buy it again or recommend anyone else to either
1.0,Description said medium adult but was a kids medium
1.0,Could not find a way to make it attach to itself and around my waist. It did not have an opening at the end to slide it in initially..
1.0,Horrible fit.  Not flattering at all!
1.0,I would rate this 5 stars except that when the package arrived two of the studs had broken backs and aren't wearable...
1.0,The pants pictured are not the pants your getting. Save yourself the time.
1.0,"Cheap, bad quality"
1.0,Couldn't even get it on...returned right away. Really cute style but made for a little girl not a grown up
1.0,"So it should have read she thought, she believed,  she did.. it did not.. the middle she said HE.. stupid error.. not happy"
1.0,"Threw it away immediately, absolute junk"
1.0,All three watches arrived dead and there is no way to  change  the battery as stated in the description. Garbage
1.0,"Broke within 5 minutes of betting, ordered replacement & SAME THING!"
1.0,"Para un niño de 6 años no sirve, es pequeño 🙄"
1.0,Dislike. Pat n leather
1.0,The material looks very cheap. The picture on the site is misleading.
1.0,"I ordered two in the same size, the taupe one is about two sizes smaller than the teal, and is badly sewn. (The ruffle isn't completely attached.) The jewelry was a nice bonus, though.<br />No size shown anywhere on the garment, I can see how sizes would get mixed up."
1.0,"This dress does not look as good in person as on the website. Also, the dress description said it would be long. It was not. I'm 5' 3 and the dress barely passed my ankles. I was disappointed."
1.0,the red paint was out of the lines for the price I expect good quality
1.0,Terrible fit. Uncomfortable material.
1.0,Very poor quality. No support. Had to return.
1.0,"I thought this would be cool, fit two sizes too small and the print was very low quality"
1.0,I tried these sunglasses twice for my husband. They broke into pieces for no reason both times. I returned them.
1.0,The stones are so tiny you can't even hardly see them. I bought these for a Christmas gift. Embarrassed to give them to my daughter.
1.0,Paper thin returned it
1.0,"The description of this product says it is a ""NCAA Officially Licensed College Apparel"" however, as you can see in the photo there is a sticker that clearly states it is ""UGP Underground Printing of college apparel."" The quality of the material is poor and the size is way to small to be a large."
1.0,Ordered two. One was bigger than it should have been. 2nd had a big blank white spot in the pattern right on the chest.
1.0,Product very cheaply made its way too small and took a month to recieve
1.0,Placed this order as a gift for a friend. Received the sandals but never received the purse. When I tried to reach out to see where the purse was at never got a response. I do not recommend buying this.
1.0,Very unhappy with product. Product came with glove already being torn. This is supposed to be a gift. This should have been inspected before ever getting shipped!
1.0,Fit on arms are short and to wide
1.0,"if you could put a zero, I would rate zero! I have not seen the worst thing! The cheapest 100% synthetic, the quality of sewing is terrible! looks like a floorcloth!((("
1.0,Stones way to big. Photo deceiving on size.
1.0,Returned they were to big for my face the second wire made it look too big
1.0,"Didn’t bring belt, very cheaply made for the price, runs very small. Doesn’t look anything like the picture"
1.0,had hole in pocket upon arrival... it's that pleather that has a chemically smell
1.0,Cheap. Broke almost right away. Wore twice.
1.0,Didn't fir well.
1.0,I ordered these for a wedding and the shoes are at least an entire size too small! I saw that they ran small but this was ridiculous! Had to return them and get a different pair of shoes.
1.0,key ring broke off within two days
1.0,"If I can give 0 stars, I would. The dress is worn and the tag doesn't match the size of dress."
1.0,it ripped 2nd time I wore it.
1.0,Was very handy for less than two months of four day a week use then the second hand fell off.
1.0,"Fabric was very thin.  Pretty design, but wasn’t happy with the fabric."
1.0,Did not look like what was ordered and were way too big
1.0,Velcro wouldn't hold after only a year.  U tried all of the recommended remedies to no avail.
1.0,Wish I had read the reviews before ordering.  Will be returning.  Cannot see unless you push the button.  Instructions are awful.
1.0,These boots are deteriorating fast. The toe is fraying and the color is fading fast. I only use these to walk around on carpet. It looks like Iv worn them for 3 or 4 years already. Its been 70 days. Also I would rather have quick laces and not have wrap lace eye hooks.
1.0,Looked cheep
1.0,This is defenitly not a drop shoulder oversized shirt. This is cropped.
1.0,This looked so cute when I first got it. I quickly put it into a gift bag and recently found out the arm had a huge rip on the seam.
1.0,Never made it out of wash<br />Only used cold water wash and complete destruction<br />Very sad
1.0,This does not look like the picture it is a lot smaller. Quality is great but fits better for a kid but you can still wear it
1.0,"Terrible sewing job. The shoulders are huge and uneven, and the sleeves are not the same length."
1.0,"Unfortunately, this is not a quality product. The logo feels like an iron-on. I don't know if it actually is or not, but it is the same kind of image that will crack and weather away after only a few washes. It also is much smaller than the size I ordered. Refund requested."
1.0,"This dress is not the dress pictured. The fabric is a lighter blue and almost faded looking. The cut is way off too. The slits are supposed to be mid thigh but fell at mid calf....I am 5'3"" but that is over a 12 inch difference....I hiked the dress up to try to show where the slit was. If fit okay but a little tight in the chest, loose in the arms/shoulders (and I have bigger arms) looser in the waist and a little tight in the hips.....my 11 year old daughter said I looked like an Asian flight attendant....."
1.0,First time worn in pool a hole showed up on both bottoms.  Not satisfied!
1.0,One the earring clasp wouldn't stay closed. Lost it within the first day.
1.0,I ordered a large and it was like a childs large it barely covered my boobs
1.0,"The internal insulation is nice, but the positives end there.<br /><br />The photos for this product are very deceptive. The &#34;leather&#34; is a matte finish, with a clunky construction throughout the fingers and the wrist. The brown in the photo is not the brown of the product, and the color didn't match any of my wardrobe. Wear these gloves for more that two weeks, and the &#34;leather&#34; effect will flake right off to display a highly visible and ugly pale brown.<br />I doubt they've got any leather in them at all.<br /><br />If the graceless silhouette doesn't deter you, I hope the chipping, color, and finish do! These gloves aren't worth anyone's time or money."
1.0,Loved color and bling but magnet fell of
1.0,Looks good when it empty. Soon as you start putting things in it becomes hard to close.
1.0,Es una estafa por que yo las pague y aun no las eh recivido
1.0,These run VERY VERY small did not fit around my 10 year olds head
1.0,"I purchased this item and it is nothing like the pictures. The bottom does not have elastic as described. Very disappointed so I sent them right back.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good onesie, try SKYLINEWEARS Men's Onesie Boy Printed Playsuit Adult One Piece Jumpsuit Non Footed Union Suit.

1.0,I ordered the item according to the size chart and the jacket was too big and the shorts were too small.  The fabric is very thin and looks cheap.  I returned the item for a refund.
1.0,"The buttons to attach the cape were missing, so we've had to find some buttons to fit. Shirt is also quite small, we got a 5, it's more like a size 3, hardly any bigger than the 2t shirt we were replacing. So we'll have to get something else. Material is light/thin. If the buttons were here so the cape could be used, I could recommend for the price, but not since you have to finish making the shirt!"
1.0,Much too small!!! I ordered a large and what I got was closer to a small.
1.0,I was so excited to wear this until it came... material feels like a paper sack and very cheap. Not flattering at all. The picture shows the colors being mainly black with white strips. This is mainly white with gray stripes. Sleeves stopped at my elbows.
1.0,Order atleast 2 sizes above pants size. Way too small!
1.0,First washing seams were coming loose.  Had some shrinkage but stretched when putting on.  Plaid does not match and legs twisted after washing with seam in front of leg. Very disappointed as I have other Hello Mello products and have been very satisfied.
1.0,zipper teeth were very easy to move which made it very difficult to both zip and unzip the wristlet.  The wrist clasp was very small and very fragile it only lasted for about 1 week.  This was a very disappointing purchase!
1.0,There is nothing Skinny about these jeans.<br />I could get two legs In each leg hole.
1.0,"runs small, I'm a 32c and it was tight. Very see threw and the padding it came with doesn't is very visible through the bra. Low quality, wouldn't buy again. The back is cute though."
1.0,"Pants are way too big, and cheaply made. They aren’t sweatpants but more like basketball short material. My teenager hated them."
1.0,I would give it Zero Star if I could.  This is one cheaply made Glasses.  Not much better that ones at Dollar Tree.  The glasses don't sit correctly o the face.  It angles out too much at the bottom and there is no way to adjust it.  The frame is very weak.  It's junk.
1.0,"Item was to fit size D cups, literally looks like pasties. Gave it to my 98 pound Bcup daughter and almost too small for her"
1.0,They did not fit as they were supposed to
1.0,"Hat ruined with how it was &#34;folded&#34; to fit in box. Ummm, can't invest in a larger box that you don't have to fold a hat? Don't buy and waste your money. Hats aren't meant for origami."
1.0,threw the shoe away
1.0,"This is not a beanie, is a jokesters hat. Very disappointed"
1.0,Have to return as stone was missing on one of the studs.
1.0,They don’t look like the picture. Very lightweight and cheap looking
1.0,Disliked and returned. The material was very strange. Thick.
1.0,"Hat is one poorly made piece of China garbage. Snaps on both sides of hat were crushed flat during install process. Can’t believe all the garbage coming through Amazon/China. It’s a pitiful excuse of a hat.  Pass it by, going to try a Rothco or Voodoo tactical and see if I can get one that’s useable. Sick of going to the UPS store, drop this product Amazon !!"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4c90e1b7eee0f309e48263e26415e348]]
1.0,The XL fits like a small. Can't even close it enough to cover my nipples and I have a small chest. The measurements listed are not accurate at all
1.0,Product was not as expected.  We returned them and ordered something else.  Cheaply made.
1.0,"This dress is very poor quality, even for how cheap the dress is. The material is almost crunchy; it reminds me of a paper gown you would get at the doctor's office. The top is not ruffly as shown in the picture. It doesn't fit as shown in the picture either, it is very boxy and tying the ribbon around just made it bunch up. I will be returning it."
1.0,Does not look like pic - material is not as expected - more like polyester
1.0,"nothing like the picture. the actual product has no flow, just a straight skirt with some crinkles."
1.0,Could not clip on to the thinnest of glasses.
1.0,Beautiful but poor quality.  Wore them once and one of the posts broke off the hoop.  Such a shame.  Wish the quality was better.
1.0,"Was sent the wrong size but I would have retuned it anyways, Very poor quality for $28 for a toddlers PJ ."
1.0,"I'm a petite size 6 female and this was way too small for me.  I had to return it.  MENS small??? A small boy, maybe."
1.0,"so i out these nose rings and after 3 days of wearing it the metal started turning green, surgical steel does not turn green. i am very disapointed. only metal i know that turns gren is copper based. but this does not say copper in it. So there us an issue. it was easy to to use,  wouldd be so much better it it did not turn green."
1.0,Looked cheep and broke first week
1.0,"It showed 3 pairs and I only received 1. A single pair isn't worth $24.99. These boxers run small and don't breathe as well as expected. My 15 year old son says the pouch on the front is irritating because it causes friction all day, especially when he's running track. He says he wishes the fabric over his upper thighs were longer. He is lean and has long legs ans he says he just doesn't like the cut of these."
1.0,Looks like a pajama top. Very disappointed
1.0,"This $1,320 necklace arrived as a Christmas gift from my husband.  It was packaged in a box and after digging through the packing peanuts I found a Ziploc baggie and in it the valuable pearls.  Mikimoto or not?  Either way I think the packaging was very unacceptable!!!  Returned!"
1.0,the bottoms did not fit at all
1.0,"The fabric is cheap .. The whole outfit is not worth it . Do not buy , save your money !"
1.0,"The dress smelled HORRIBLE, like someone danced in it all night and then returned it. It also had deodorant stains.  Disgusting."
1.0,This bag arrived sealed in three plastic bags and I think this was because of the awful smell. The smell just kept getting worse as I opened the package. It was so bad I was gagging. This bag will be returned.
1.0,Good looking shoe just not as comfortable as you would think.  Size runs big.  I ordered a 12 but should have gotten 11.5.  Normal shoe size for me is a 12.  At least they weren’t expensive.
1.0,Was supposed to come with 7 1.8 oz package idea but only came with one!!!
1.0,"This looks absolutely nothing like the photo, it’s horrible. It’s see thru..all of it. The material is cheap and the red “sparkle” is just metal dots on the fabric."
1.0,These are awful!! First off the pads are all one piece and don’t cover your actual boob and makes the center connected! There’s zero stretching to the bra so it just hangs on you!
1.0,The arms are tiny
1.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend in December. This past weekend it broke. There is supposed to be a one year warranty but since I didn't buy directly from Cufflinks Inc. they are unwilling to honor it. Trying to get a replacement from the seller who sold it to me. For a $50 money clip, you'd think it would be more durable. Looks like it was glued..."
1.0,"These did not fit me right.  I’m 5’2” and weigh about 108lb.  I bought small and it was way too baggy.  I bought X- small and it’s still too big in the butt area.  Because of the pleats from the waist band, there’s a a major puckering between the back pockets.  If you’re not too endowed back there, you won’t be able to fill it and the fabric will bunch up.  The material is a bit flimsy and bit cheap looking.<br />I do like the zipper look at the bottom.  Just wish they fit better."
1.0,Doesn't fit as expected. Very small. I ordered a 2x thinking it would be about a 22 and it looks more like a 14 or 16.
1.0,"Me enviaron size S, cuando pedí kl perdí el dinero"
1.0,"Looks  like a cheap version of the picture  shown. Thought the material would have been a little lighter, instead its thick and doesn't feel so good on. Longer than expected as well."
1.0,"Awful. Not what I ordered. Cheap quality, completely different from the picture."
1.0,No where near the picture. Couldn’t even get them on. Cheap costume material. I’m 5’11 and these are meant for a petite frame.
1.0,"These shoes were a whole size too large, and they look extremely cheap and plastic. They look like shoes you’d buy in a back alley way in LA. Not worth the price. Not even half the price. Returning."
1.0,Broken and Bent
1.0,"My order took a month to get here and is ridiculously small! I ordered a 3x hoping to wear it like a dress and it is too short, sized like a medium, and the upper arms are tight. They say that &#34;Asian sizing&#34; is used but the sizing stops at xl."
1.0,This item had such poor quality. I don't think my head could have fit through the neck hole. The print was poor also...
1.0,Worn twice and its falling apart
1.0,"Love the material! However, the lettering is very dark, it would be nice if it stood out a little more. And if there was room to put mc's logo in the back middle. Other then that, it's a nice vest"
1.0,THIS DOESNT EVEN WORK!  DONT BUY THIS ITEM!
1.0,"Just no, it didn’t even look like a letter."
1.0,These are designed very poorly. They’re sewn almost like they’re backwards. There’s a big ponch of fabric around the front crotch area and not quite enough to cover a tiny bum properly at the back. They also seem to shorten in the wash.
1.0,Fabric is such awful quality!!
1.0,The Stars fell off the first time I wore them.
1.0,The material was tooooo thin. The shirt fit more like a small so everything was squished. I returned it.
1.0,"The top doesn’t stay in right spot, especially the non strap side"
1.0,The fabric was gross. It was shapeless and the shall was three sizes smaller. Looks more like a nightgown. Don’t waste your money
1.0,This looked horrible when put on. The pockets hang out and make a pointed shape. The fit was horrible and not at all the size that was expected.
1.0,Cheap feeling and the style isn't as nice as the picture.
1.0,Ripped along the seams
1.0,Ordered a pair to wear on Christmas and picked the XXXL since I normally wear a 2x in pants. I was so excited when the arrived until I opened them up. First off they smelled terrible and second they were WAY to small. They were more like a Large and you would think “they stretch like leggings” Nope not a chance. I washed them so I could give them to a friend and the draw string came out. I did a return since now I didn’t even want to give them to a friend
1.0,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME EVEN LOOKING AT THESE SHOES, VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND HARD AND VERY TIGHT, OMG WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY. TERRIBLE"
1.0,I would not buy this item if you have adult hands. This watch is fir children
1.0,Purchased for a 4 YR OLD.  They have a horrible smell from the dye!  They don’t unfold properly for the 3D fit.
1.0,They need to make these smaller.  The material is wonderful.  I give it a 5 for that.
1.0,Yeah this shirt was a hot mess and looked nothing like the photo.
1.0,The shirt is different than described:the picture. The material is stiff. I returned it but didn’t receive a refund. It says it was sent October 6th.  It’s now October 22.
1.0,"The piece broke with little effort. I would not buy it again or suggest anyone else. Nice concept though,  my daughter liked until it brokevrightbaway."
1.0,I ordered 3x and I usually wear a 2x and it was so tight my sister who wears a large fit in to it very well.
1.0,I ordered two sizes larger than I normally wear and it came in a little gurls approx size 6/6x
1.0,Way smaller than expected even with buying a bigger size a definately shrank by 2 sizes!!!
1.0,"The metal button/clasp that clips into the other side of the watch band actually fell out of the rubber on day 1. There was no glue or anything holding it in place, and it just fell out. The band is completely unusable now.<br /><br />It's disappointing because the materials actually felt really nice for the price."
1.0,"Way too small, too tight, rode up when moving, couldn’t hardly move my arms as there is like zero give in the fabric. Returned it."
1.0,"I haven't even had this duster a month, and it has already ripped during washing. I was veylry disappointed"
1.0,The stud part of the jewelry was 2short & awkward 2get in2 my piercing hole....seems it's just not not enough ....I tried several times. The jewelry itself was pretty...but I just couldn't get it in the piercing hole.
1.0,"Ordered three sizes up, and it wouldn't fit my daughter, who is two sizes down from me..."
1.0,Fabric is thin and there is an unflattering seam down the middle of it. Just not what I expected. I would return it but it took about a month to get here. Had I paid better attention to shipping expectations I would not have bought this. Not worth it.
1.0,Waaay to big. I don't even wear it..
1.0,I is not white but a cream color & the material is  so thin & sheer that you can see completely through it.
1.0,Very awkward cut. Super boxy and not flattering
1.0,"The elastic on the top strapless part broke on day1, Nearly caused a woredrobe malfunction in public, but luckily I was able to catch the dress and pull it back up. It also runs a little on the larger size. Photos before it broke"
1.0,"1. Socks not as advertised. Much too tight even though the item is the largest available<br />2. Smaller size has been authorized for return, however, the larger size is ineligible for return with no explanation as to why. Both items were from the same source.<br />3. I think a refund should be given."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ab5f5a9070d2d1e8da1dd62d53ab7aba]] I am disappointed I ordered those for St. Patrick’s Day and it looks nothing like the picture/image.
1.0,This is not touch screen friendly. Going to be returning.
1.0,Pills after one wash ☹️Not buying again over priced
1.0,Got the wrong colour. I ordered the PINK colour in this dress and I was sent the BLACK. I'm all the way in Jamaica and now I have to waste my time in sending it back. Very very very disappointed. When the correct colour is sent I will be able to say how it fits.
1.0,Fits just fine but is transparent and looks cheap. Maybe a colour other than white would be better but I would not waste your money on this.
1.0,"An hour after I had put a pair of them on, someone pointed out a hole in my thigh. The worst thing is it was the black pair, which I was most excited about. Won't be buying again."
1.0,This looks like long rectangle with holes for tour arms and head. Too short in the back to wear as a dress. Definitely what I expected. Sent back immediately.
1.0,"I have a very small wrist compared to other men. The band on it would barely fit on my wrist, way too small of a band. The manufacturer of this watch should pay attention as to whether it is a man or a woman purchasing the watch. The second thing is that it doesn't light up or have a light switch on it. You have to either be outside or right underneath a strong light to be able to see the clock hands to tell what time it is. I would not buy another one!!!"
1.0,"Way too small; ordered size 14/16, but they’d fit a 5 year old."
1.0,These shorts are not 4 inches. Material is good but this is straight misinformation. This product needs to be taken off the market for trying to scam peoples money. Will be returning asap
1.0,"I do not like the feel of these tights. Also very tight at the waist. I was disappointed. I'm probably giving them away, as the material is not the soft stretchy cotton I hoped for.. I wore them but the new ones that I didn't wear are probably in the give away. I would not purchase them unless your very thin and you dont mind a rougher  or less soft pantyhose. I'm a size 12/14 ladies."
1.0,I didn't like them doesn't look like the picture
1.0,We ended up returning it because we couldn't breathe through it.
1.0,BUT THIS IS NOT THE SHIRT I RECEIVED. THE ONE I RECEIVED SAYS BLESSED MOM NOT TBALL MOM. AND IT TOOK 3 WEEKS TO GET TO ME SO I DON'T WANT TO SEND IT BACK. NOT HAPPY AT ALL!
1.0,"These earrings are very poorly made... And super heavy... Beware!!! Save your money, even tho they are cheap, and doesn't cost a lot... I've had $1.00 earrings that are a way better quality..."
1.0,Very cheaply made. I wear a medium but ordered a large because I wanted a loose fit. It was small.
1.0,Doesn’t look like the photo. Inside lining way too thin. Smells bad.
1.0,"Pretty sure this isn’t even the same dress as the pictures... It’s way too big, even in the smallest size. It doesn’t have the same shape as the pictures at all. It’s baggy and frumpy-looking. The colors are off (enough that I noticed as soon as I opened the package). And to top it off the fabric feels like crap. I got catfished by a dress! Returning immediately"
1.0,"I normally wear a medium for shorts, but I ordered these in large because others had commented that they run small. However, when I received them, they were more like a size small, far too tight and uncomfortable for working out. Worse still, they are a really weird shape. The front comes farther down my legs than the back?! Normally, the leg parts of shorts are longer in the back to accommodate for the curve of your backside, but not in these. I'm very disappointed, and I'd have to ship them all the way back to China to get my money back. Bad buy."
1.0,Stitching in toe are is bulky and takes time to get used to. Only wore them 3 weeks and have holes in the bottoms. You get what you pay for though.
1.0,So I definitely ordered a medium in this set and the outfit that arrived is what I’m guessing is an XL. When I went to review my order it didn’t show a size and now it seems like they only have one size?  The pattern is super cute and the material is nice enough I’m just bummed it doesn’t fit!
1.0,"this pendant is so beautiful but construction is poor. My first and the second replacement were broken. First one arrived broken hook and second one I was able to use but the same day the chain hook broke,"
1.0,It not good for working.
1.0,and is more of a breast binder than anything else.  I guess I have to buy a real posture corrector.
1.0,Did not think it would be so small. Looked<br /> bigger on line. To late to send back
1.0,I ried to send this bracelet back too big and bulky.  I tried to send this item back and I printed out the return label and notice that I had to pay for the return.  I went to see how much it was too return and it was OUTRAGOUS!!!!! It would have costed me $99 to have it returned to China.  This crap!  I'm thinking of not ordering anything ever again!
1.0,This has no shape to it. It’s awful. The line on the chest was off. We burned it. We didn’t want to send it back. It did give us a laugh when we all tried it on.
1.0,Should be 3 broaches. Only 2 came and 1 of the 2 were broken. Zipper doesn’t zip over halfway and the material is paper thin on the rest of the dress. The lace embellishments area completely different color. Better off ordering from wish.  Definitely not worth the price!
1.0,"Gorgeous glasses, but lenses were cracked and scratched."
1.0,It's nothing like the picture. It's weirdly big. Color is not even close to the one on the pics.
1.0,This shirt is so thin and looks NOTHING like the picture. Don’t waste your money!! It’s awful!
1.0,Very low quality. Smells awful like some chemicals. Not a good item for the price. It twists a lot. Design does not stay in place. I will not recommend.
1.0,"Pay attention to the chain length, way too short for me."
1.0,"Was nothing like this picture.  Was not long in the front.  It came to the waste.  Super thin, already unraveling."
1.0,"Very, very cheaply made.  Lasted one hour and split in half in my nose. I am very, very disappointed."
1.0,"I am disappointed with the size, I ordered three sizes up from what I where in coats, and it was still too small. And I was stuck with the item, could not return it. Lost my money."
1.0,"These feel great to stand in with support. BUT, the fabric covering the toes is ruff with stitching that gave me a blister and they fall off when I walk. The velcro occasionally lets go when I walk. I don't feel safe on the steps. I gave them to Goodwill."
1.0,"The white is like a sheer see through, not what I was expecting from the picture.  I returned it."
1.0,Se transparenta mucho definitivamente no lo recomiendo
1.0,Not happy with this item. The lights do not work. It calls for some type of battery That is unidentifiable. Foam parts do not stick well with the provided tape.
1.0,"Keychain was supposed to light up & make sound, but it did not work.  Thanks for the fast refund, though"
1.0,"Totally dissapointed. The box was broken, tied with tape and the worst ... Without the bracelet, only the label and something plastic inside the box came. Obviously I will return it."
1.0,Creepy shiny fabric. I would love this in cotton.
1.0,"I’ve purchased other colors, for some reason the peach color felt like doll clothes- not anything you’d want on your skin."
1.0,"Even though the price was so low, these aren't worth the money.  I found them difficult to use and pretty much useless."
1.0,The product is way way too small and the sizing chart is not accurate at all.  I asked to replace for a larger size and they said yes but required that I ship it across country on my own dime.  No thanks.  Don't buy this product.
1.0,Washed once and they are starting to fall apart.....
1.0,"This order came in a 2pk but were obviously two different sizes. One fit, the other was too small."
1.0,"Pure TOY. Not worthy to be mentioned as a servicedable walkie talkie as such goes, but I got sucked-in by the words of the marketer. I am returning these forthwith as I would not have these in my inventory, for any reason, maybe for a 6 year old child, but certainly not for an adult. Not worthy, Oh, god of Amazon, not worthy."
1.0,"No pleat in skirt. A lot lighter then pictured. Thin, cheap fabric."
1.0,"This is pretty, but not for a woman size this was probably for junior it didn't fit at all. :-("
1.0,"I bought this watch for my husband in July and now 2 months later, it is broken! The spring inside broke preventing the watch from working and the date stopped working."
1.0,This shirt totally fell apart in the wash. The appliqué fell off in the washing machine! Cheap!!! Not worth the money!
1.0,"Very disappointed.  When this arrived I had my son try it on.  I thought the shirt was rather thin but that's not a huge deal, he can wear an undershirt.  But then I saw that the left leg of the pants was damaged near the hem.  It's not just a matter of sewing up the seam - the pieces were not aligned correctly when constructed so there is not enough fabric on one side to close it up.  See pic attached.  I still might have just dealt with that, but then I noticed a stain on the right side front of the collar that looks like rust.  Any kind of decent quality control should have caught the pants leg issue, the stain, or both.  The vest and tie are great colors and my son wants to wear them for his grandmother's wedding, so I'm not going to return them (insufficient time).  I will either need to deal with both repairing the leg and removing the collar stain, or replace both the shirt and the pants.  Not happy at all."
1.0,Did not function as expected.
1.0,"I ordered selection 'C - Green Long Flower Dress'. Even though I ordered a Medium, which should have fit according to the size chart, it wouldn't even come close to fitting - much TOO SMALL!<br />Experience shows me that with this type of item sold on Amazon, where there are multiple selections of style and/or color, the customer reviews are misleading. You may be ordering one that would turn out like this, where another color would be just fine.<br />This dress is an XXS at best - even then, I doubt it would fit much more than a 10 year old girl, with zero chest<br />The body of the dress BARELY closed around my 25 inch waist. There is simply no salvaging this.<br />The fabric feels odd - almost plastic. The print/color is pretty, but this style is offered by many sellers on Amazon, so if you like the look of the dress, definitely do your research and find one that fits your desires in fabric!<br />As I have also found, customer reviews really cannot be counted on to be truthful, honest or accurate,  with many people given free or discounted items."
1.0,Too big and the cut looked frumpy on me.  Material is very polyester-y - feels really weird.  I'll be returning it.
1.0,Poor cheap quality. The fur on these gloves didn't match one another
1.0,"WARNING they will tear a hole on top part of big toes. had to take a cab for 7 blocks because of how damaging they were to my big toes, i could not handle the pain of the shoe rubbing the kin raw. too late to send them back. i even tried applying a cushion above the top of toes, but the pressure is so strong it rubbed through."
1.0,"I bought this bracelet because it looks very nice in the picture but the reality is that looks so cheap and poor quality, but not just that, the worst part is that smells terrible, I absolutely hate it and do not recommend it at all."
1.0,one trip in airplane and come back missing wheels and all scrach...poor materials
1.0,I received the wrong ring
1.0,Not sure how I like this... not even sure I have it on right. My box came with a piece of fabric and a string... is there a video on how to put it together because it does not look anything like the picture.
1.0,"I thought this top was a knit,it's slinky.Like satin."
1.0,"I really needed this belly button ring because of a series of treatments that I was going to encounter; requiring that I have no metal in my body at all. // I was very happy that the product came so fast, but when I went to open the package and unscrew the ball - the entire frickin' thing broke. Snapped right in half. I hardly even touched it!! The plastic bar literally snapped right in half. What a waste of money, and SO cheaply made. Not worth more then 1 cent. // Still trying to figure out if I can even send it back & get a refund due to the fact that it's body jewelry. I didn't even get the chance to use it, and I had to go out and buy another one. Don't buy this product. It's way way cheaply made and not worth it."
1.0,Very very cheap...grandson wears a 7 I ordered a 10..still too small... but long...toooooo long
1.0,"The bracket broke in two days, very cheap."
1.0,Jems  fell off day one
1.0,Not one bit. Very cheap made. No pockets. Lasted 2 weeks. Very sad I cannot get my money back
1.0,Really nice shirt except the t was missing on both shirts I ordered (the original and the replacement).
1.0,"Horribly unflattering! I'm so surprised this is a Magicsuit, because they usually ARE like magic. This one was immediately returned. Just nothing good I can say about it. It flattens the girls and makes you look pregnant at the stomach. Nope!"
1.0,Absolutely horrible<br />Ordered A SMALL and they fir my 12yo 15yo and ME<br />Horrible fitting too
1.0,Runs too small and one of the sizes came in wrong.  I ordered a 2xl and they sent a xl.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"I got a size larger just to be safe and the thing wouldn't of even fit my thigh. I was in a pinch for time and had to rip out the elastic that maybe could of fit a plastic Barbie doll, buy new elastic and rushed around to 6 differed seamstresses before finding someone that could do it. That cost another $40."
1.0,Came in broken and awful! Save your money!!
1.0,"This package took a long time to arrive, and when I got back from my vacation, it was to late to return it. I followed the size chart and it was WAY to small!!"
1.0,didnt like at all
1.0,Garbage. i thought somewhat of actual gold....my mistake. Good prop for a play though...
1.0,"I bought this because i use this for the gym and work.  Just simply taking the monitor in and out caused it to break within a week.  I kept it because it was still snug.  A week after that, it broke completely and my versa literally fell out of it.  The plastic ring on the outside is very thin and brittle."
1.0,Veryyyyy cheaply made. I don’t know what kind of fur that is but it feels like unwashed dog fur and the scrunch part around the wrist wasn’t even symmetrical and the hole below where the zipper starts by the cleavage was just a fine example of piss poor quality oversight. I won’t be buying clothes from this seller or amazon again. I’d rather pay Walmart because at least I know there is a level of expectation that can be met.
1.0,"$12 for one pair of socks made with 30-something g % polyester. No thanks! I am so glad I checked before I purchased. The audacity of these companies these days is just crazy. If you want polyester socks go to TJ Maxx. For $12 you can get like 4 pairs, and still have enough left over for an Icee on your way home."
1.0,Looked cute online and when I pulled out. Once I had to put it on my 5 year old it was a tad to short. When you try to zip it up it gets stuck. Then the front part of the dress came undone. I purchased this dress for my daughter for Easter and now I have to go and buy another.
1.0,Not really a fan. very tiny. almost insignificant... questionable quality...well you get what you pay for I guess...
1.0,Took FOREVER to get here and not exactly what I expected. Too puffy.
1.0,"Really wanted to love this but it definitely was far below my expectation on what I would receive. I gave this to my mother for Xmas but the quality is just not great. Honestly, the box it comes in is nicer then the actual product. I’m addition after wearing once, my skin started to turn green which has never happened to me before, so disappointed and frustrated. Spent $80 on something that can’t even be worn"
1.0,Not sturdy broke right away
1.0,"Horrible product, my son was waiting on these shoes for hes birthday just to find out the lights did not work, would not light up."
1.0,poor quality and seller tried to bargain to get only a 50% refund and now will only give me a refund if I mail it back myself and pay for the shipping.
1.0,My son needed this for his Halloween costume.  It didn't stick at all.  Dont waste your money!
1.0,It took FOREVER to get this swimsuit!  Then the bottoms are very Skimpy!!!
1.0,Size was not true to size. And instead if skinny jeans they were full but cut. Hard scratchy material
1.0,Not much smaller than the original
1.0,"This is a joke. Save your money, it looks like broken paper clips. It doesn't even resemble the picture."
1.0,Too big/loose for glasses.  Would not stay on.
1.0,An ok play shoe and that is about it my little girls wore them one time and both bow's have came off.
1.0,"No es lo mismo que la foto, pequeña y de calidad muy baja"
1.0,This band did not fit my Fitbit Charge 3.  The connection on both ends do not match or even come close to the original bands that came with the device.
1.0,It’s ugly didn’t look the same as it does in picture
1.0,"The color faded within a day of usage, do not recommend."
1.0,This product runs small and these are super skinny jeans.
1.0,Inside lining already coming apart and only used the purse for one day. Zippers are difficult to close. Overall seems like a cheaply made product. Looks cute but not very practical...
1.0,"This bag looks good for about a month. But then no matter what you do the front and back pockets never stay buttoned up so you have them hanging open. And for the 2 minutes you are able to get them buttoned up, the inside fabric looks like its riding up.<br /><br />The front and back will quickly become stained blue from the blue liner fabric. It looks nice, but definitely doesn't have much longevity.<br /><br />Any chance I can get a refund or exchange for a different back?"
1.0,I ordered a 10/12 for my son and it was super small.  And that’s his size for clothes right now.  The pjs said ‘Medium 10/12’.  I guess I didn’t catch that.  He wears ‘Large 10/12’. So I guess something to think about when ordering.  It actually fit like a size 8/10. Way too small for him.
1.0,It broke the moment I put it on! So disappointed!!
1.0,Came in the wrong color and broken
1.0,Not cute at all.  Fit funny.  I should have paid attention to the man made leather no give.  Have not been lucky ordering shoes online that I don't already have.
1.0,Does not have a flattering shape. Material is thick and stretchy.
1.0,Turned colors in less than 3 days.
1.0,"I keep my phone in my purse not my pocket, and within 2 weeks the metal<br />design on the back is already peeling off."
1.0,"Wore once, washed once, already pilling. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,They don't look like the picture and for some reason the post is curved. I am pretty unsatisfied with this purchase.
1.0,Not the correct size like labeled. Way to small
1.0,"The fit was good, but the buttons came off after only a few wears/washes."
1.0,"Wouldn't accept my initial review which was, not the colors I ordered. Now the adjustable straps are unraveling."
1.0,Too cheap! Broke inside a week!
1.0,"Runs very small. If u are looking to get this for someone, order 2 sizes up."
1.0,I wanted these so bad and regret getting them now. I usually wear a med or large pants and I ordered a large just to be safe and I attempted to try the pants on and could not ever get them all the way up my legs. The large is like a small.
1.0,For $30 plus I’d expect a heavier hoodie. This felt like a rebranded fruit of the loom hoodie from Walmart. Super thin left “fuzzies” all over my undershirt. As a taller guy the hoodie fit short and wide. Will definitely not by again. Actually wanted to return them but ended up just giving them to a couple of homeless guys as they were just sitting in my car for 2 weeks.
1.0,"I wear a 40DD, I am a size 14 regular in clothing.  I hooked the straps and before I could put my blouse on the rhinestone part broke.  It was worthless for me!!"
1.0,Ugly fake and dull... this is false advertising
1.0,"Came and out of the box the date selector totally stalled. Sent it back to Amazon posthaste, but...  I had to find and travel to a UPS store to return a defective item. Give me a break!"
1.0,Es lindo pero llego<br /> un arete roto y el empaque un fundita plastica por.lo menos en una cajita no se.hubieran roto
1.0,This pants are transparent!!!!!!!!! Nothing like the pic! Do not waste your money with this
1.0,It came missing screws.  One of the arms was not attached.  Not broken just never assembled.  Avoid is my recommendation.
1.0,"Very disappointed that the packing wrinkles are almost impossible to remove.  It is very wrinkled and I have hand washed it, hang to dry and used a warm iron as instructed and the wrinkles are still very prominent.  For the price of this top, it should not be that difficult.  If I still had the packaging, I would return them."
1.0,"Cut badly, extremely thin, very cheap look and the color (light green) not bright like the picture, but very dull. Disappointed but got a refund."
1.0,I order the XL and it was ridiculously small. My daughter who’s 10 years old was able to wear it
1.0,I did not get what is showing. I got the handbag with coin purse and a thin mesh reusable grocery like bag
1.0,"When I bought this, I did it listening to those few good reviews and not the horrible ones. I'm here to tell you now, don't do that! The product is actually very cheaply made and my zipper broke while trying it on. I usually wear a medium in skirts, I got a large and it still broke while I tried to squeeze in. If you're thinking of buying it and you have any hips at all, don't! (Probably don't buy it even if you don't have hips, the zipper is some trash)"
1.0,I didn’t like spending $53.04 only to have it come apart after just 14 days.<br /><br />Purchase at your own risk knowing it may come apart in longer than 14 days.
1.0,"They’re much more delicate then I would’ve liked, very flimsy build - slightly crooked but I like the color a lot!"
1.0,Dress had a ripe before I took it out the bag.  I wish i could give Amazon customer service a 5 star! Easy refund/return service!
1.0,This is called a sweatshirt in the description. the fabric weight of this is more like a thin ladies tee shirt you can see through it. I tried to send it back. I have to pay $70 to ship it back to China so I am out my $15.
1.0,"Very small, they would maybe fit a child. They broke when I put them on. Extremely cheaply made. I would not recommend getting these."
1.0,If I could give it no stars I would!! The magnet does not even stay in place to keep the band on. Very disappointed in this band. Save your money and go to Best Buy
1.0,"Just a cheap piece of plastic, nothin special. I’ll probably just hangin in the garage somewhere. Wouldn’t buy again."
1.0,"Poor product, they only reached half way my calves."
1.0,Really cheap and seemed as if it would break very easily. I returned them.
1.0,"Not a thing about this dress fit a semi plus size girl.  The bust you could see 1/4 of my bra cups, this is certainly for someone who doesnt need a bra. The fit was so bad I threw the dress away."
1.0,Very cute but really small!  Way over priced for the quality and size.<br />I’ve had it 3 months and it already broke!
1.0,Very thin see through fabric and cut very small. 4-5t barely fit girl that wears 3t 😡
1.0,"I read the mixed reviews before my original purchase and decided to take a chance... Glasses look great in person, however they are very, very fragile. The frame broke around the lens on the right side, returned for a new pair and the new frame broke around the left lens."
1.0,"This top has side slits, and the hem located here was not done correctly.  Due to this, the hem does not lay flat, but flips up on both sides.  This is because the material was thin, and it was not cut on the bias.  I cannot see anyway to fix it because it is a manufacturer's defect.  I would not recommend buying this defective item."
1.0,Did not help my vision at night.
1.0,"Just pointing out that the ARMY has Soldiers. The AIR FORCE has Airmen. If you buy this for anyone in the Air Force, you're going to look stupid."
1.0,Extra room on top of foot or my child has really skinny feet. But looks like made well.
1.0,I used them once and the next day when I went to use them again and the one didn't work anymore.
1.0,"They were the correct size for me and couldn't get them on my feet. Spoke with customer service at Copper Fit and it was like talking to a wall. She just kept saying that they ""just must not be made for me"". She was a zero for customer service. She said since I bought them from Amazon, send them back to them. Amazon has authorized the return."
1.0,Had for 2 months and broke.  Horrible quality
1.0,"I don't understand the reviews for this item. Maybe I got a different dress than others? It did not come with a belt like it shows in all the photos. Empty belt loops only. It is WAY smaller than expected. My ""suggested size"" based on measurements of this item was a Large which is my usual size. I ordered an XL to be safe & it is WAY too tight. The elastic in the shoulders is poorly sewn & also too tight to fit the way the pictures suggest. The fabric doesn't feel nice either. Returning."
1.0,I cannot say whether or not these will work for you.  I have standard size holes in my ears.  These will not fit through the holes which renders them useless.  I am going to try liquid bandage on the posts.
1.0,AWFUL AND CHEAP RUDE SELLER TOO
1.0,Cheaply made. Now I am left to pay return shipping to china.
1.0,Waste of mone
1.0,Definitely not thermal long johns for temperatures below 30 degrees.  And if you are even slightly well endowed there is no room in these pants.
1.0,Took the watch out of the package for my daughter and it will not turn on
1.0,"not the style as expected, looks like a choir gown."
1.0,Does not look like photo
1.0,They  fall right out
1.0,Cute but feels very light & cheap.
1.0,"I ordered an infant size and although the package said infant, the tag said toddler.  It's big enough to fit on my head. :-("
1.0,This was broken in a few places when it arrived.
1.0,"Not what I expected, the bottom of the shoe not comfortable"
1.0,Description is incorrect. It does not come with the quick release spring bars. Which was the only reason why I purchased this product in the first place.
1.0,To tight. Don't wear. Can't get them on.
1.0,"Very tiny, very deceiving picture, I can use them at all"
1.0,Not sure if this was supposed to be a joke.  I ordered a bodysuit size L. I am a size 10 so I would wear a medium or a large depending on the product. What I received is something you would put on an American girl doll.  It was so tiny I could not put it past one leg. I mean really? My entire family had a laugh on how ridiculous this was
1.0,these plastic goggles are really dense - they do not sit comfortably on your head and the elastic is very weak!
1.0,Not at all what I thought it would be. Was orange and not yellow nothing like picture
1.0,"Very cheap, small, fits horrible, and the print looks cheap and dinghy. Don't do it!"
1.0,"Do not purchase this item, it is a cheap foreign reproduction of a quality item handmade and designed by an American small business."
1.0,"Party supply store quality good enough for a child, not a woman who appreciates fashion."
1.0,La devolvi 🤷🏼‍♂️
1.0,"I like the idea of these foldable glasses. They look great, but... Difficult to open as hinges are very tight. Within the first few times I've worn them the string holding the lens in broke and the lens fell out."
1.0,This item ...it's not a dress ...looks more like a robe made out of latex . Unfortunately it's almost impossible to find  a good dress on Amazon.Found better quality dresses on JCP or even Kohls.
1.0,Used it 1 time and now even when locked you can pull it open and close it back without the combo
1.0,Sucks of fabric n style<br />Just a trash fabric
1.0,"These aren't waterproof as advertised. I hadn't had the opportunity to hike in the rain with my girlfriend as I bought her a pair as a gift. Fits well and looks good, but I was drenched. I tried it out on a rainy day and my Gortex boots got drenched from the inside because my socks got wet! Luckily we hiked nearby the house and it was not cold out yet. I can only imagine the misery and risk of hypothermia if I had used it on a mountain. I bought these because my cheap Walmart waterproof gear was cumbersome for my girl, but at least that stuff kept us dry! I'm totally going to return this!"
1.0,Scarf came with a huge rip in it.
1.0,"Too small, but very cute."
1.0,Jacket is way too small . Ordered a 5xl so I can layer.. Fits my granddaughter who is a large .. very thin and not as long as it should be
1.0,Gold and Yellow are very different colors.
1.0,I didnt get the correct headband. I specifically ordered this set because it had pearls going around the headband but the one I received doesn’t.
1.0,Size 2X fits like a medium. Had my daughter who is a size 4 try it (the xxl) on and it fit her!
1.0,didn’t fit
1.0,It has a tear in the material the very first time that I wore it it started unraveling very warm but very poorly put together
1.0,Broke the first time trying to put it on. No elasticity to it
1.0,Ordered a small. Looks more like a large. If small is considered a size six to eight.
1.0,"They finally had to refund my money, never received the watch, really wanted it, just never got it.  White face black numbers are the easiest to read."
1.0,I liked the look.  Didn't realize there was no check book spot and when I got it there was a tear in the card holder slot.
1.0,This dress was adorable but the zipper on it was so hard to maneuver I would have always needed help to get it on and off. Seams were also already ripping upon receipt.
1.0,"I received this product today. The fabric is thin but has a nice feel to it. But this is way too small. I usually wear an XL and ordered a 3XL and it was still too small. If you have a longer waist this will not fit. I am sending it back.<br />It is difficult to tell in the photos, but the front waistband is not elastic, only the back waistband has elastic."
1.0,"I love the look of these they are so cute and made well, but the gold finish on stars wore off after 2nd wear"
1.0,Not what I had thought I ordered... it was just a plastic ball tied to a string<br /><br />Zero starts would have been more accurate.
1.0,"First off the design is really cute. However it’s huge like extremely huge. It’s definitely made for a man, when i tried to put it on you couldn’t see the Virgo at the bottom because is was under my chin. It’s like a thick silk material that i didn’t like. I wouldn’t buy to be honest."
1.0,Very large.  I wear 3x could of wore 1x.
1.0,I give no stars if I could. Glasses came scratched and very low quality.
1.0,Here is what the shoes look like after a second day of wear.  They frayed and looked fuzzy after the first wear.  They are cheap and not worth the money that I paid for them.  This is a rip-off.  Don’t waste your money!
1.0,Not a Zissou hot. Very disappointing.
1.0,Really horrible quality. Sloppily made with paint smudges.
1.0,Broke in 5 minutes in two places
1.0,I only used the first pair for 2 minutes and one side of the strap came completely off. The second pair was on for 3 hours. top strap started loosening from the base of the wedge and the bottom of one of the sandals was flopping and detaching. Too bad because they are cute platform wedges.
1.0,These are terribly made and have no hold. The roll down to your knee and were a bad purchase idea.
1.0,"do not buy this ,it is not what you think,not even close to the photo ,this come from china and material is terrible and terrible design,do not waste tour money and time ,it run small,is ugly ,is a cheap material and it is not what is in the picture."
1.0,Cheaply made and looks like children's glasses
1.0,Way way way too small! And very transparent!!!!!
1.0,Frame is twisted.  Does not rest horizontally on my face.  The left side  rides higher than the right. I truly believe that  I have seen better frames<br />on the rack at my local  99 cent store.
1.0,"I’m 5’7”, 145 and normally wear a 6. Ordered the medium based on the sizing information. I’m not sure if this was a manufacturing error or something, but the shorts are wayyyyyy to small. Fit me like bad spandex. Not loose like the picture at all. I tried the shorts on my 9 year old, 53 lb daughter and she laughed that they fit her! Pic for you to see. Not a total loss I guess. I bought pjs for my daughter."
1.0,Keychain separated from the wallet holder on the second day. Hardwear feels like it could break. I only had 2 keys on the chain so it was not overly taxed.
1.0,The material is very itchy and it looks like polyester! It’s very cheap made!
1.0,Watch band disconnected from the latch after one month. Do not buy.
1.0,I ordered them as a gift but they looked fine.
1.0,"Nothing different from the basic T you can get for 5 dollars, the fit is even worse. Don't waste your time here."
1.0,"Upset, i want this in a large, i believe i have returned this for a bigger size!!!!"
1.0,First time we went out of town and fold them up and put them in the garage two of them cracked… Just junk
1.0,"looks nothing like the picture, again made for a child"
1.0,way to big!!
1.0,Very uncomfortable and difficult to put on!
1.0,These are so small they barely fit over mouth and nose. There is no extension on top and bottom basically just  straight across .  This mask (blue one) Measurement is 3 inches inches in height . Compared to to a regular mask that opens to 6inches in height.
1.0,"Amazon's sizes DO NOT match up with Fruit of the Loom sizes--and of course I discover this AFTER I opened the package of underwear. And of course Amazon will NOT take them back.<br />Plus the material is horrible!!! Very poor quality.<br />Also, what is shown in the picture is NOT the underwear we received. We got bears with sunglasses. My son wanted what was in the picture."
1.0,The necklace was beautiful but the chain broke AS SOON AS I TRIED TO PUT IT ON.
1.0,I will say they are super soft like lula leggings. I wanted so bad to like them but they are cheaply made. I went to try them on and there was a hole in the side.
1.0,Material is low quality they don't shape you in any way very uncomfortable they ride up in the crotch and give you a camel toe with or without panties.
1.0,Fell apart when takeing plastic wrap off when held it back together got the feeling band is to small for most men and I have real skinny wrist... Can't recommended.
1.0,XL more like a USA medium
1.0,"The 1.5&#34; is actually 2&#34;, frustrated!"
1.0,Back seam tore the first time I wore it.
1.0,Fits an adult.
1.0,"The watch was great initially but after less than a month, the band broke. I emailed the seller a week ago with my complaint and never heard back. I understand that you get what you pay for but I expected the product to last more than a month. Disappointing."
1.0,"Normally I never take the time out to write a review. But this was the WORST Pokémon pack set my son and I have ever received. There was atleast 2-5 doubles per card, which meant almost every pack had the same cards. We did manage to pull one rainbow card I believe, or it was from another pack I had and it was a trainer card..Not even a regular Pokémon card. We got 4 holos in total, and a pair were again doubles... BIGGEST waste of money ever. Should’ve just bought packs individually elsewhere. I’ve never had seen so many doubles in a box set. Absolutely TERRIBLE. Would NOT recommend at all. Wish I seen a review like this prior so I wouldn’t have purchased it...."
1.0,These socks wouldn’t even fit my 5 year old!! No way these are adult sized socks. Inaccurate description
1.0,"It is advertised as 100 percent Shearling. it is not. It is a Polyurethane fake leather. The other stuff they sell is real wool, so I thought the gloves would be made of real sheepskin. Unfortunately not so."
1.0,The material was so uncomfortable I had to return them. Couldn’t even try on more than one.
1.0,Not flattering-material more like a costume.
1.0,Nice colors but they are silk not cotton.
1.0,I purchased this for a cruise trip to bad it has really bad stains this is not worth it guys I should of listen to the previous reviews.
1.0,It broke after only a few days............scattering beads everywhere.  NOT very functionally well made :(
1.0,I mean I read all the reviews and they all said not high waisted... even pic of model wearing jeans they don’t look high waisted. BUT the pockets were on my back hahaha got a good laugh! But not sure what definition of high waisted is.
1.0,"I really wanted to like this bra, but it would not stay up.  It keep sliding off my chest to the point where it wasn’t supporting or covering anything anymore and there was no point in wearing it.<br /><br />And that aside I thought you were able to buckle it in the front when you put it on, but you still have to slide it on like a shirt making the buckles pointless.<br /><br />Don’t waste your money and look into a better strapless bra."
1.0,Item was broken when we received it
1.0,Not what I expected beads were tiny!
1.0,"All I can say is, ""you get what you pay for""  Would not suggest."
1.0,"Update:<br />After about 2 weeks the second leather strap to hold the end to the main strap fell off.....<br /><br />Great quality, classy look. Great leather that has character and looks 3x its cost. Love it."
1.0,Nothing like the picture...looks like a kids sunglasses. VERY cheaply made. It remains in its box on top of my closet. Super bummed...so cute in the picture. They tell you its plastic - but didn't expect it to feel and look so cheap.
1.0,"Sweater looks frumpy, isn't sized correctly, and is poorly made. Do not recommend. I ordered a small and it's sized more like a large."
1.0,"Any dollar amount above $3.00 is too much for this cheap watch band. It easily stretches out of shape, so I would suggest paying a little more and getting something quality."
1.0,This product was very poor quality. Used it once and it broke. Tried to return it and it is not allowed. Very disappointing.
1.0,"The bracelet looks exactly like the picture, but it is not well-constructed. There is no adhesive securing the metal to the leather braid, it did not stay together long enough to wear."
1.0,"You want sore ankles, then buy these. I don't wear boots much, if ever at all. I think this is the 2nd pair I ever had. I don't know if it's just me, but the top part hurts my ankles. Too stiff, too hard, not flexible or soft enough. I'll learn my lesson next time during Christmas and buy boots way more expensive. All these $25 ones I'm sure are all junk, and that's why you sell them for that price. Stop acting like you're giving people a good deal and ripping them off. Stupid companies. You deserve my 1 star, and hopefully many more to come. Junk like this don't even need to be on the market. These boots aren't even worth $10. I bet I'd get a better pair from China."
1.0,It is pretty enough but I was picturing something much smaller - this is most of 1 1/2 to 2 inches across.  Nothing feminine about it.  A real disappointment
1.0,Don't buy this! Maybe there was product change or something but this is not the dress that showed up. Problem is I still want the dress in the picture!
1.0,These are very small and do not fit an average foot very well. And they don't have free returns.
1.0,Not worth the price at all!! It’s dollar store material not even Five dollar store. I wish I took the other reviewers advice. I thought it could work for my costume but my costume is way too bad ass for this junk. Sorry not sorry.  It’s just really really overpriced.
1.0,Horrible material. One had a huge hole. The others ripped while carrying small groceries.
1.0,it is not working
1.0,"This jacket is NOT worth the money. I had to throw it away after 2 months, which is of course out of the return window. $30 down the drain and wasted because it began ripping at the seams all over the place!"
1.0,"It used to be beautiful, its made cheaply, zippers broke after 1 week...."
1.0,The quality of the shirt is great. Too bad they sent me the wrong color.
1.0,These gloves are GARBAGE
1.0,"Made very cheaply, would not buy again..."
1.0,"vino con problema o sea los lentes están torcidos y no se pueden enderezar porque se rompe fácilmente<br />necesito que me de una repuesta a esto por favor a la mayor brevedad posible, recuerde que me dijo que me lo enviaría en 30 días y aun no recibo información al respecto.-"
1.0,Couldn't keep the belt clasped; cheaply made.
1.0,Very big but very small coverage
1.0,Cups to small band size to large wasted my money.  I would not recommend this product
1.0,The leggings are not true to size and they are kinda see-thru
1.0,Los esperé con muchas ansias pero en un día corriendo mi bebé se le rompió
1.0,They don’t hold a charge
1.0,This sheds horribly. I have washed it three times and It it still shedding.
1.0,I wear a medium in shirts so they aren’t small but this medium is quite larger than other mediums; I wish i could exchange for a Small.
1.0,These were way to small for an adult. A complete waste of my money. I tossed them in the trash. Very cheap quality as well.
1.0,Size was off and way too thick
1.0,Worst purchase ever
1.0,3 yo Daughter was excited and loved all the accessories by the wand came broken
1.0,Band cannot be adjusted for small wrists - A notice of “wrist sizing & that adjustments cannot be made” needs to be made clear in description and specifics
1.0,It’s nice but I chose rose gold but received it in silver.
1.0,It's NOT a Puffer jacket at all it's a leather jacket with a lining that has a little bit of insulation. The jacket runs very small a 3xl size fits like a size xl instead.<br />Not What You May Want Not Worth Your Money. Look Elsewhere....
1.0,"I brought this based on some of the reviews. They were wrong, this item is too small although I went up in size. The material feels elastic. I am very unsatisfied."
1.0,Super delgada y se me revento alos 4 dias me pareció mala compra
1.0,"This was a gift for my daughter--she LOVES it! Very well made, well-fitting, and covered in nicely cut rhinestones. Sparkly!"
1.0,Don't like don't look anything like the picture
1.0,"They don't stay on my heel, so disappointing!"
1.0,"I should have listed to the bulk of the other reviews.  These had no staying power - as soon as you put them on, they started stretching out.  You definitely can't wear these under jeans or pants - all they did was bunch up. There's no elastic in the bottom cuff of the leg to keep them in place. By morning, these fit like shorts instead of underwear. I'm returning these."
1.0,Completely see-through. Shorts underneath didn't fit well and the skirt part rode up when I walked. Would not recommend.
1.0,"Son bonitas .pesan poco,muy ligeras.Pero no son de plata..deberían bajar el precio porque no son de calidad..no las volvería a comprar por ese precio .."
1.0,Dont buy them if you're a plus size! So small ot would fit a small child!
1.0,I sent these back because the waistband was too weak.  They wouldn't stay up at all.
1.0,"Three pack, all the same labeled size, but cut very differently. Only one actually fit. Waistband is narrow, not very comfortable. Fabric thin, felt like they would be sweaty material."
1.0,"If you're over a C cup, I would not recommend. They don't look or fit correctly."
1.0,"I’m very disappointed. My busy is 44”, but I ordered up to 48” and it still didn’t fit! I could barely get the dress over my bust and then the top only covered my bust, so the ribbon, which was completely detached, would be directly under my bust and not on my stomach at all. The bottom does not spread out like the picture, it clings to my legs and there isn’t even enough material to put a slip on if I wanted it to spread out even in a size too big. I don’t recommend this product? But if you do insist on trying it, but two sizes up AT LEAST and manage your expectations. I will be returning mine. I’m very disappointed."
1.0,"Way too short and small, looked ridiculous with size 38C chest."
1.0,Run very small and get smaller after washing them in the laundry machine. Not happy a bit
1.0,My son ware a size 1 shoe these where snug. I got the 1-2 size. Also he wore them two times and they split at the toe in less the 4 hours of ware time.
1.0,very very poor quality. pls improve the quality and sell
1.0,Item returned. Did not look like the picture. More like a mouse. Cheap quality
1.0,Not built for the long haul.  I bought this bladder 7 months ago. I purchased it for longer trips where my 2 Liter bladder is to small. In the past 7 months that I have used the bladder maybe 10 times. This month it started leaking where the hose connects with the bladder.  I did not like running out of water halfway into a 15 mile cross country mountain hike. Contacted the vendor and received no response.
1.0,"Its really long and loose fitting, it would be ok if i was with child or somewhat depressed and actually had a physical and mental need for loose baggy clothing."
1.0,"Very thick material for underwear, outline noticible even with jeans"
1.0,What a waste of money! I ordered it because it started it was TEMPERED GLASS. Turns out it is SOFT FILM. The film is already messed up! The case is also very cheaply made and flimsy. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!
1.0,"This ring looks nothing like the photos,<br />Stone is glued on crooked and not the same stone in the picture!"
1.0,Los recibi sin filtro
1.0,might be good to tight to tell. Buy at least 2 sizes large
1.0,"It looks cute in the picures. It's not. They need to put a warning on all this cheap, shiny stuff. If you're into cheap and shiny, go for it. If not, keep scrolling."
1.0,"I like the purse, but it has a bad smell. Iv left it to air out, but still smells."
1.0,Poor quality. Thin material. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Online the dress looks sweet, but once I opened the delivery and tried the dress on, the fabric is very itchy, and the sleeves don't fit well, too puffy on the shoulder, I was hoping for something more sleek.  I will be returning the dress."
1.0,I didn't get the pin i was suppose super mad but at least I got a refund
1.0,The advertised product or the pictured item on this is so far from what you are actually getting<br /> so buyers beware. Don't be deceived & make the same mistake I made.
1.0,The clasp broke within two weeks of having it
1.0,The girls are in fifth grade but on the small side and the head bands hurt their heads. The robes and all are low quality. With strings hanging everywhere and seams showing. Not impressed. Definitely quantity over quality with these.
1.0,I got these because my daughter has 1 more year before we get her ears pierced but I am beyond unhappy with the product that I received it was missing a few earings and the magnets were not right like they fell apart so she can't use them now that is bad business that let down my 9 year old daughter
1.0,Very bad craftmanship
1.0,"This was way more lightweight than I expected. It  is teeshirt material. And it really wrinkly ;( I do like the color, but that's about it."
1.0,It's too small & it doesn't glow.<br />Don't buy it
1.0,Would like to return for larger size but did not come with a return label
1.0,Runs very small.order at least a size larger.
1.0,"I ordered a 5xl, since based on other reviews these run small. I normally wear 3xls. I figured two sizes extra and I'd be fine. Wrong. Neck and sleeves are good but chest is tight. It's tailored for someone who is big, but not fat- more muscular. Also there were a lot of loose threads, even some extra fabric stitched in near the collar, like some cotton ball looking stuffing or something accidentally got caught up. This was right next to a pin so it's like I know whoever put the pin in saw it and was like &#34;meh&#34;. Spend a few bucks extra for something that isn't junk."
1.0,Product description states for ''Adult''  Not true !
1.0,"So cheap!! It ripped as I was putting it on! Plus, within only a few days it started to look raggedy. Pass on this. Trust me."
1.0,"My ears are stretched to 00g with spirals and I cannot for the life of me fit these in. I've tried with lubricant, everything! The ends are bigger than the center so dramatically they absolutely will not fit through a 00g hole. Useless."
1.0,The left lens was popped out of the frame before I even took the glasses out of the plastic bag they arrived in. The left leg was also bent too far. Will be asking for a refund.
1.0,They look good but in less than one month broke.
1.0,"I usually wear a small or a medium, but these leggings were so tight I couldn't even pull them up, and they were a size large."
1.0,While the band is stylish and comfortable and affordable. The magnet doesn't hold to the band too strongly (it attracts to other metals) so my band kept slipping off my wrist. I almost lost my watch :(
1.0,Extra flimsy. Broke in 2 days
1.0,Less than one month of taking the bag to the gym 3 times a week and the inner lining tore away from the top inside leaving the largest side compartment open to the inside of the bag. Useless. Fortunately Amazon did not quibble about returning it for credit. Wow! Nice looking bag. Don't see why they would use fabric for the liner that couldn't hold the stitches.
1.0,Lost the ball within the first 30 seconds. Feels to difficult to handle with your fingers alone. A tool or directions would be helpful!
1.0,Not the quality I expected and runs small
1.0,"This was a cheap polyester. Felt like a Halloween costume. I was afraid the scallops would start fraying. Also, I ordered the fushia color, but it was Barbie pink. I am 5 ’ 3, 138 lbs, size 6. The medium looked like a mumu on me. I probably could have gone to a small, but it wasn't worth keeping so I returned it."
1.0,"Cheaply made, very disappointed ."
1.0,Really cheap material. Felt cheap on the skin as well. Clings. Immediately returned it.
1.0,"Over half of these finger lights fell apart upon opening the package. The little button batteries were everywhere and it was a huge chore to put them back together. Should they fall apart again, the batteries will be a huge danger to little ones who might put them in their mouths."
1.0,The fit is amazing but I returned it because I was not satisfied with the material.
1.0,It got a hole in it after two washes.
1.0,"The hot pink color is nothing like the Amazon picture.  Cute dress, but not shiny and not hot pick.  The lace is also fraying."
1.0,Arrived broken. Good because it was so cheap looking. Don’t buy.
1.0,Worst! Straps came off after one use. Don't buy thid
1.0,Cheaply made showed wear and looked like it was about to break with three days in use. I read the other reviews  and cant believe they where from the same product.
1.0,"I was so excited when the packaged arrived!<br />Never been so disappointed!!  To say this sweeter runs small is an understatement!  It looks nothing like the picture diplics. Almost like its a pettite size. The arms are short and lenghth of body is just below my butt.  I am a medium size 8. I wasnt expecting for it to fit really big but this like a little teen size. Its almost like someone washed it, shrunk it than returned it.  Since sweaters stretch, i am going to wash it, stretch it and see how that works, if not than ill just call it a lost and give it to my neice who's 15 and suppor skimny and short! So disappointed.  Maybe my last time ordering any more cloths from China!!"
1.0,This came and as soon is I opened it I could tell the fabric quality was poor and completely see-through! Wanted to wear for Christmas but now I’ll have to return and find something else.
1.0,Me salieran quebrados
1.0,DONT BUY!  Poor quality. Pads are not attached. Thin material!  Way too long for a small. Needed xs.
1.0,"This was a very small size for the size I usually order.  The fabric was very thin and see through.  I was dissatisfied.  When I usually order clothes from Amazon I usually have very good luck, but not this time."
1.0,It was to big! according to the size chart it said medium to large with my weight been 165 and height 5’3 I needed an extra small because it’s so big and loose
1.0,I was very excited to receive these socks.. however I found a big hole on one pair of them even before the first wash.. This is both unfortunate and unacceptable.
1.0,Too small and back flap was odd
1.0,Practically child sized. Complete waste of money.
1.0,These are not supposed to slide or fall off. They do.
1.0,Zipper damaged. Poor quality dress.
1.0,"unfortunately the bar was too long, which is how teeth get cracked. and the half balls have a pronounced edge on them that cut up my tongue. Plus the clear doesn't hide the piercing at all like other retainers I've used. Its still very obvious I have it in my tongue."
1.0,Smelled and felt damp when package was delivered
1.0,The band connecting button is not on the longer end of the strap like in the picture.  The silver connection button is on the short ended loop side.  This makes it extremely difficult to put on.  You have to slide the longer end into the hoop after fastening it to your wrist making it uncomfortable to wear and difficult to put on.  It's not the same product as shown in the picture where the button is clearly on the longer strap and the loop on the shorter strap.  I have a button and a loop on the same short strap.  So Confused and disappointed with this buy.
1.0,Started my day around 9:00 a.m. with a nice fit. By 2:00 p.m. these sleeves constantly slid down my arms. Took them off and tossed in the trash.
1.0,Got these for my mom for Christmas and she said they do nothing for improving night vision.  Too bad
1.0,"You get what you pay for.  It's very difficult to change the date and time.  When I decide to wear the watch, I have to use a needle nose pliers to make the adjustment."
1.0,It's pretty but it is not bended the way it should be. The shaft is too long and constantly have to adjust it so it's not sticking out. The curve needs to be bent more
1.0,Broke within five minutes
1.0,Ordered xs.  Received 2xl petite. Will keep and give to friend who can wear that size. Just won't order from trusted footwear again. Can't trust um...
1.0,Not as nice as in pic
1.0,Says it's rated for 50 lb and I put 15 lb in it and all four of the strap handles completely busted off about 10 seconds after I lift it off the ground
1.0,Box doesn’t line up—poorly made.
1.0,Fell apart within weeks
1.0,Not like the image or the description. Felt and looked cheap!!!!
1.0,Annoying the way it hangs off wrist.
1.0,"I'm guessing that most of the high reviews come from people who rated it the first time they wore it and liked the look.  It is an ok-looking watch.<br /><br />Had they used it awhile they'd probably give a more realistic (lower) review based on everyday realities:<br /><br />1)  The &#34;winding&#34; runs out quickly. If you wear it the whole day,  then take it off before bedtime,  the hands will have stopped by the time you wake up next morning. So you have to reset the time and shake the watch before it stops again--every day!<br /><br />2)  These watches break very easily.  I actually got two watches, this and another similar model.  One I dropped just a couple of feet, the other got splashed a little while I washed dishes (It did not go inside the water, just a few drops got on it).  Both watches broke immediately, were completely useless after just a couple of days of wear.<br /><br />So to summarize, these watches look fine and work well the first time you wear it. But because it winds down so quickly, you'll have to reset the time every time you take it off for 4 or 5 hours.  And if you drop it once or it gets a little wet, it'll be time to get a new watch!"
1.0,This dress is very tight and keeps riding up . My dress size is 10-12 and I ordered a large. The dress does not have a zipper so dependeding on your hair style it can be very difficult to put on. Was very dissapointed.
1.0,Sent it back. It doesn't adjust and could not get it over my small wrist.
1.0,"Item broke before I got the button on! Handle got stuck & since you can not pull it back out a lightly smack on a table will release it.. The tiny screw that holds the needle in place broke when I touched it, needle fell out and could not get it back in, so in the garbage it went. Disappointed, doubt I can get a refund."
1.0,They said it was 14kt!  The earrings was gold filled. The color change less than 3mos
1.0,Criminals
1.0,"Ordered 2 different colors. Received same color, brown. Didn't order brown at all. Pic showed taupe. Too small"
1.0,The is one of the worst purchases I have made to date on Amazon. Read reviews of this item before purchase. 4 1/2 stars and pictures are misleading. If you paid more then 5 bucks for this so called Jamaican<br />wig you lost. This set up belongs at Party City. You wear a wig like this if your making fun of Jamaican's...😗👎
1.0,Looks great though quality is very suspect. Heal fell off after first wear. Be aware.
1.0,This outfit was a cute idea.. just didn’t make the cut the material is awful( which isn’t the seller fault) I should have read.. the pants are straight leg.. looks like a cute jogger set on the picture but definitely a bad church outfit in person. The strings are uneven as well. Returning it tomorrow
1.0,Item arrived broken with chains out of place hanging.
1.0,"Dissappointed, i ordered the blue one a month before this, and thts perfect, but this arrived broken...not happy with this"
1.0,"they just tore as i wore them, the sizes are not accurate, bad material dont buy!"
1.0,"1/2 did not work of the 40 I ordered. I don't mind a few that are broken, but HALF. Would not suggest them. Try Oriental Traders."
1.0,Too small n couldnt return it
1.0,"very poor quality. loop for button broke, red bled onto Santa beard. and Santa's red button nose was chipping away. this is all on the first wear and not even washed once yet. returning"
1.0,I do not recommend. Not good quality
1.0,"I bought two of these. One in a medium for the bottoms and one in extra large for the top. Bottoms fit okay. The top on the other hand, an extra large mind you, would fit a non developed teenage girl. I am a busty women but not so much that an x large wouldn't fit me. Waste of money."
1.0,The first wash logo faded looks old and washed out. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,This dress is not for a curvy girl. Pockets make hips stick out. Not flattering at all. The color wasn’t quite the same as picture and the material was very thin and cheap. Returning immediately.
1.0,"They are very see through, and the top of the leggings fall down a lot."
1.0,Had to return due to a latex allergy so I don’t know if it works or not.
1.0,"These are cheap, tiny (like child's size), and the lenses are dark enough that you should't see through them, but alas you do. I can't wear these, they aren't nice enough to even want them lying around. Very very bad."
1.0,Not worth the price! Made cheap and doesn’t look like the Picture and looks like it had been used.
1.0,All 3 pairs were made from 2 sizes.. The left seemed to be a large and the right a small.. The seem was as a result not in the center on the front or back and one leg felt loose and the other tight.
1.0,"This product is supposed to be a mask, but I think is poorly made."
1.0,It came to me packaged new but had sweat stains under the arm pits...
1.0,"Disliked this item. Paper thin, I blew out 5 candles in 1 breath. 👎 I wouldn’t recommend this mask to anyone."
1.0,"I am typically a large and got a XL because I recently got a side tattoo under my bra line and wanted to show it off and the arm holes are not as long as pictured, even when sizing up."
1.0,This was horrible and floppy.  Didn't work at all and was pale white and wouldn't match any skin tone.  I could have purchased this at Dollar Tree and been better off wasting my money that way.
1.0,"These stone plugs turned my ears green, making them unwearable. Do not purchase!"
1.0,With in a month it broke at the toes.
1.0,"I bought these for my 11 year old boy who plays basketball. He was so excited to get them, but  he ended up having knee and other leg pains after a week of wearing them. We made him switch back to his old shoes and after a few days the pain subsided. He tried to wear them again and the pain came back. $80 bucks down the drain."
1.0,"I can wear XL to XXL in leggings of all brands, however, these fit me more like a large. The shorts were very small for an XXL and wouldn’t stay up. They are definitely run small so I would size up one to two sizes with these"
1.0,This was so so itchy. It is also huge. I ordered a medium and it looked like a bathrobe.
1.0,If I wanted to buy socks for myself women’s size 8 I would have. There’s no way these are toddler sized. They fit me perfect though. My daughter on the other hand size 10t shoe they fit to her knees. If you’re looking for your kids don’t buy these they fit like adult socks.
1.0,"This is a very cute skirt, and I’d like to give it 5 stars, but I need to be able to wash my clothes, and you can’t wash this! I am aware that it is 100% rayon, but I have many 100% rayon skirts that I wash and line dry and they do not shrink. However I washed this skirt with two others I also bought from Amazon, and this one shrunk so much I can barely wear it. So unfortunately that’s money wasted. Before I washed it and it shrunk I was considering buying another; it fit well and the pockets are a plus."
1.0,"Absolute garbage, looks nothing like they do in the picture"
1.0,"It is a very cheap made, feel and looking jacket. Do not recommend"
1.0,very cheap feels like plastic.you get what you pay for.even though it would have been cheaper from candy machine...
1.0,Was way too big than what was expected
1.0,"Broke the second time I wore them. Got caught in my hair and when I untangled it, the thin part snapped so easily. Was pretty bummed."
1.0,the shirts was to small I got a large and it was very small. I sent them  back and got a refund
1.0,No ornamental seams as shown. Gloves' fingers don't correspond to actual human hands dimensions. Flimsy and see-through. DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,"I have heard great things about 90 Degree yoga capris, but these were not for me. I ordered a size up based on reviews. They are incredibly comfortable and fit perfectly, but totally see through. I would think they would be great for everyday wear, but not exercise."
1.0,"I was not satisfied with this product at all.  I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas.  She normally wears a large.  I ordered a large, but it was very much too small for her.  The material was cheap and thin.  You could see right through both the top and bottoms, and I ordered a black set which you would have thought you couldn't see through a darker color.  Would not purchase again."
1.0,"Any more plastic content and you might as well wear a trash bag instead. Seriously, the poly content is so high, the fabric feels terrible on the skin, it's too stiff, and you can hear every move of it. I've had wrinkle free almost 100% cotton shirts, there's really no need for that much plastic in it. Unless you want to bring the price down. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"My last review was denied, my guess is because it was negative. Don't waste your money on this product. It offers zero protection of your phone. Terrible quality."
1.0,"This was very beautiful, however it broke the first day I wore it."
1.0,"I was very disappointed that the first time I tried to pull my badge out, it popped lose and hit me close to the eye! Very poorly made and you could barely make out the stork. It was a waste of my money"
1.0,"The product looked good in the picture but when received the tie bar was very thin, flimsy and bendable. It was very cheap looking and not of good quality. I returned it immediately and purchased two for the price of this one that were robust and substantial and of significantly higher quality."
1.0,Two of the strap cords have broken within a week.  Cheaply made and not durable.
1.0,"Searched for womens, small lens, mirrored sunglasses. While this definitely has a mirrored effect the lenses are huge. I have trouble looking at a picture of sunglasses alone and my tape measure doesn't have the sizes these are measured with. It would help a lot if they would show them on a person so you could get a real idea of the size. If these were shrunk down to about 2/3rd's of the size they are I would love them."
1.0,Shoes looked good but worked fine for the first hour and then one of them stopped working and will let charge or turn on
1.0,"I liked the cheap price, and colors. I didn’t like the poor quality. These carabiners have a very weak locking  spring that tolerates very little side pressure before disengaging. Definitely made for very light duty."
1.0,Literally does not look like the picture whatsoever. Just a cheap plain white tank top with no ruching etc. looks terrible. Will be returning as soon as I finish typing this review.
1.0,It broke within 1 week. Not worth it
1.0,Never able to rid of gross smell
1.0,Did not like this purchase!
1.0,These pants started falling apart after the first wash. Seams tearing open and pilling after one wear and wash. Very disappointing
1.0,Don’t fit had to return
1.0,"To be honest, I couldn't it's bad, but the power button is already not working, tapping the button is very easy to power off the watch shown by the picture, because the power button is loosing now, although I can figure out what happened, but for my daughter it's not working, she is very frustrated  as she doesn't know what happened to the watch.<br /><br />BTW, I bought the watch for her birthday in Feb, just 3  - 4 months, it's starting to be wrong! It's not too much to expect the watch to last at least one year till her next birthday, but it's disappointing!"
1.0,Horse hair!
1.0,"changing my rating to a zero..the product didn't last a year, changed battery and still dead"
1.0,They sent me two of the same foot at least that’s the way it looks if it isn’t I wouldn’t recommend them for anybody
1.0,"These fit perfectly when I tried them on.  I washed them, (I wash all my clothes in cold water, and hang dry) they shrunk almost 2 inches and tighter all over!!!"
1.0,Ordered a 3x and received what appears to be the equivalent of a medium size shirt.  Material is very thin/see through. Shirt looks cheap.
1.0,material is paper thin and see through. Maybe could be used for a swimmig suit cover up.
1.0,"What I received looks NOTHING like this picture.  The sweater in the picture is really cute, what I received is ugly and old looking."
1.0,like the Theives essential oil good for preventative upper respiratory infections I hear.
1.0,"The frilly sleeves are too much. I felt like I was wearing an outfit that the cowgirl in Toy Story would wear, in a completely not cute way."
1.0,Key is bigger than my hand<br />Not at all what I was expecting<br />Does not come in a nice box like the description says<br />This sucks
1.0,The feather on this item arrived looking like it came off of roadkill.
1.0,Nunca recibí el producto. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
1.0,"received the bag before I left on vacation.  the bag started to unravel the first time I went to the beach.  I love the colors and material of the bag, just hate the fact that it was not sewn correctly, therefore this bag will not hold up.  Would like to return and get another to replace the bag I received, however I see that now it is too late.  I was on vacation for 2 weeks and upon return had to get back to work with little time to deal with returns.  Probably more information than you like.  Will be very cautious in the future about ordering online."
1.0,The skirt was terrible. It looked like 2 sheer pieces of clothe sown together. I never wore it.
1.0,Bad.  Just bad.  I'm 5 foot 9 inches and 140 lbs. I ordered a medium. I wore it once.  One time.  I set it on hand wash and cold.  I then light heat dried.  It lost 3 3/4 inches as a result.  I can't wear it because it's wide enough for a medium but a straight belly shirt but it's not cute.  I'll never order from this company again.
1.0,The dress is very poor quality. Not true to size. Returning the item is too much of a hassle.
1.0,Don't buy this POS unless almost $400 is a price you'd pay on a disposable umbrella. First wind storm and bent arm and no sign of a way to get replacement parts. Lame.
1.0,"I have been wearing for abut 5 days, the jewelry does not stay in place, slides along the band, yesterday one of the leather bands broke, popped."
1.0,"The color, quality and fabric are top notch. I have ordered this shirt in another color and have been impressed by everything about it. However this shirt was so absolutely ridiculous in its sizing. I ordered it for my 9 yr old granddaughter’s birthday. Upon holding it up to look it over, the sleeves were soooo long I knew instantly it was missized! I ordered a GIRLS SIZE L. The markings on the package were misleading as to size, not what I ordered! She insisted on trying it on however. The sleeves were about 7 inches too long, hung to her knees! The body came to her knees! I decided to try it on myself. I’m a women’s med and the sleeves were about 4 inches too long on me. I actually could have worn the shirt, but the proportions were all messed up. I barely got it over my head and struggled getting it off!?"
1.0,Did not receive dress in picture it’s a completely different style of dress
1.0,these are junk. As soon as I went to put the first one on it broke on me. Returned
1.0,does not look like the picture.  looks like a kids craft project.  like someone dumped a bunch of glitter on it.
1.0,Pin broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,It has nothing to do with labyrinth it’s a Bowie quote not from movie at all
1.0,"Shipped in a tiny plastic sleeve, the posts were been flat down. Could not gift these, even though they are super cute."
1.0,L do not reccomend this hat. The inside seam is frayed and falling apart.  Very dissatisfied.
1.0,I ordered the ring size that I  always buy from any other jewelry seller. But this ring was so far off on sizing I couldn't even wear it on my pinky. Again Very Very Disappointed.......
1.0,I was super excited to get this and I got it a size larger and it turned out to be alot smaller
1.0,"Okay, and cheap"
1.0,really didnt like this look better on pic wouldnt wear to a dog fight sorry
1.0,Super cheap af.. do not wash in washer.
1.0,Waterproof not so much. Coached a soccer game and still go wet wearing this waterproof coat.
1.0,These certainly are not acrylic and they are cheap looking.
1.0,"No pocket, not like size chart, returned"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8f9435585248c55a8cd82660175f499c]] Did not like that it did not stick together and I only used it twice 😔
1.0,"Ordered black and received pink. Also, the money slots are a bit undersized so bills don't fit flat.  Would not buy again."
1.0,Fit and quality was absolutely awful.
1.0,This shirt looks nothing like the picture. It's short and boxy and cheap looking and feeling.
1.0,Flimsy. Broke first day I wore it  :(
1.0,I bought this to use as a beach coverup. It’s good I only had that in mind for it because the material is very thin and see through. The arms are a bit tight and so is the button behind the neck.<br />After one wash material ripped and is now yellow
1.0,These were orange not red...do disappointed
1.0,These are not worth the money! Almost impossible to install and don't stay in place.
1.0,You can see thru it
1.0,"I ordered these socks but received a pair of red fighting gloves/wrist braces instead. Sent them back and asked for the right product - and received another pair of the gloves. Very disappointing as these looked like the best socks for my purpose, will have to look for something else now."
1.0,Pretty but wouldn’t stay in
1.0,The horn didn’t stay standing as shown in the picture and the size was wayyy too big
1.0,"se hace negras, no son de buena calidad."
1.0,I loved the look of this mostly because I work at Kay Jewelers so it looks like a huge pearl bracelet but unfortunately it broke the first day ….
1.0,Fit like pantyhose rather than girdle.  Held nothing in.
1.0,This dress is like wearing an itchy potato sack. It's lifeless and shapeless. Don't waster your money
1.0,"Total junk, and I’m a big fan of cz’s vs real diamonds. To date, I have ordered 6 seperate stones (multiple sizes) for a ring I’m having custom made. NOT ONE of the stones is true to the advertised size. This company just loves to send ONE size stone, no matter which size you actually ordered. If you like wasting time with returns, buy it. Also, the height of the stone is so shallow that it’s almost flat and that will look like crap in a standard setting height, all while if you customize the prongs to be low enough to accommodate the shallow height of the stone the ring will look really dumb and fake. Junk."
1.0,"Uncomfortable, way too heavy, very hot, lumpy. Would not recommend."
1.0,The vendor sent 3 black shirts and 2 white ones. Not at all like pictured
1.0,Not cotton at all - very small too- Japanese sizing
1.0,"Annabell Ingall Isabella Tote is a complete waste of money. The pebble leather is such a poor quality it looks and wears like plastic. Unfortunately, in conjunction with the product quality the customer service quality direct from the designer is terrible as well. There was no refund option or return, and once the product was deemed unsuitable, I completely lost contact with the company. There was no return or response. Sad.<br /><br />The tote bag is a large compartment, there is a small flap of an inside pocket for cards or possibly a phone. The thin straps, like the bag are made with a very low grade leather. PLEASE save your money for another designer!!"
1.0,When my bf bent over<br />They all fell out of his shirt
1.0,The color in not the color of a face. Too red in color. I ordered another from the same supplier  that looked more flesh color and that was red too. Did not match the description one the add. What a waste of $28 dollars. Very unhappy!!
1.0,No one's body is proportioned this way 😐 fits arms and legs but makes my body look like a praying mantis.
1.0,Did not like this hat. Returned it
1.0,Not what I expected I ordered a size up still doesn't fit right. Looks nothing like the picture way too long would not buy it again
1.0,We ordered them a 1 1/2 sizes larger than we normally wear do to reviews suggesting to order a size larger.<br /><br />Not a very quality product to start with.<br /><br />RETURNED!
1.0,Magnets don't work. At all.
1.0,Not the dress in picture.
1.0,These are more shorts than swimsuit. I ordered XXL and it fit more like a Large. There's no swimsuit liner either.
1.0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I instantly noticed fuzz/dirt/debri/hair sticking to the material when I opened the box. As I pulled the papers away and pulled one of the shoes out, it became apparent that these shoes had indeed been worn before. The side of the shoe near the zipper (see photos) has worn/rubbed spots in the material and the area near the back of the heels have been worn down to the under layer (see photos). Something is also really off with the way these shoes were made— there’s a bunch of weird, empty space where your foot goes and they aren’t shaped the way the arch of a foot actually is (see photo with my finger comparison, my foot is along the top of the shoe). So disappointed. They are not at ALL what I was expecting."
1.0,Was trying it on. And bamm.. Chain broke. Wasted money
1.0,The purse was defective in 3 spots.
1.0,"El producto que recibí es de una sola pieza y sin bolsillo trasero, no corresponde con la fotografía"
1.0,the print was super cute so i tried it but i felt like the straps were waaay too close together giving me a weird look.
1.0,LOW quality
1.0,"This is NOT for the right ear, the piece they send is the opposite of the picture and fits your left ear!"
1.0,Product was too small from sizing info.
1.0,I hope your wrist is not too big especially if your a man.  Overall fairly cheaply made.
1.0,This shirt is not at all like described. Fits tight and short. Very unhappy with it.
1.0,It is extremely visible under clothes.  It also bunches and folds really bad in the lower back.  I am 5ft 3 119 pounds got a medium and it is so long it is impossible to sit down.  This almost looks identical in the photos to my old one that costed almost $200 but it is not even close to the quality.  If this is something that you really want to shrink your waist size do not buy this one.  Save some money up and buy a quality one that will not fold and crease in the back and that is seamless under even tight clothing.
1.0,This product is cheap made do not recommend it for anyone.
1.0,Too small in stomach area and sleeves way to big.
1.0,They dont last my left foot the back on the inside has a small indent hole in it which cause a cut and bruise and very painfull to walk i finally got to use them one time in april then for October 3 times then the hole started to happen and cause issues very disappointed in the quality of this brand and designer cause they did no exchange ir fix the issue at all horrible dont buy
1.0,Loved it but already tarnished
1.0,Had the watch strap for less than a week and part of the buckle fell off.
1.0,I returned this sweater because it looked and fit nothing like to picture. It did not drape at all. The return was processed with no trouble.
1.0,The color is this sweater is gorgeous- I ordered the cranberry- but the sweater weave is very loose and threads pull easily and unravel to a hole - I’d pass on this one!
1.0,Don't buy. It falls apart.
1.0,"not what i wanted, they were black on the inside :( super lame and super hard to see out of."
1.0,Uneven and awkwardly made. Looks like my daughters wearing a garbage bag.
1.0,I brought this product almost a year ago and back then it was true to its name. Tailored with 100% cotton. I brought 3 this time hoping for the same quality but oooh no. It has polyester. The sheen of this material makes it so obvious. Sad that she now has the product poorly made in china
1.0,"I loved these when I first put them on, but they ripped at the big toe the first time I wore them. Poor quality! Not worth the money."
1.0,The pattern was upside down on the pants and the top!
1.0,"Tremenda calidad pero super pequeño, ni con el tamaño mas grande me servia a mi y soy 2XL"
1.0,Seems up at the split after 3 uses. Terrible quality. Trash!
1.0,I am returning this item because of very poor quality. Right after trying it in the house the top fabric begun to tear of. Color is nice but quality very poor.
1.0,Pin ripped through the end of the band after a few weeks of use
1.0,"Only received 10, the listing says 12!"
1.0,Material was pretty rough to be for a baby. She didn’t enjoy simply trying it on.
1.0,Too damn small. The sizing sucks. This isn't worth the buy.
1.0,Attempted to wear these and they're  already  broke. Cool design but beyond cheaply made.
1.0,"Winder looks nice and worked flawlessly for just over 2 months. Now I can hear the motor working, but get no action. Save your money, does not last.."
1.0,Product does not fit. The size does not reflect your true size. Too small
1.0,"I bought these socks hoping that they would be easy to put on. I used the size chart to order the correct size, and I do realize that compression socks are tight by nature, but what good are they if I can't get them on?"
1.0,Came in two pieces.  I fixed with pliers.  I wore with a white blouse which ended up getting a gray ring where the necklace hung.
1.0,"These lenses DO NOT fit on  Oakley Trillbe X 009340 sunglasses.  My local optometrist informed me they needed to shave 5mm x 2mm to fit, and the curvatures are totally off from the original lenses. I didn't want the hassle with return/refund, so I am spending another 15 bucks to have them trimmed to fit.  The lenses are 1/2 the thickness of your original Trillbe X lenses.  It is much lighter ( a plus ) but they feel much more flimsy and IMO is more susceptible to damage."
1.0,"I normally wear a size medium(size 6) and it is too small.  I need to exchange for a large, but the window for exchange has closed and Amazon is so un-helpful in trying to resolve issues as these.  I can't even reach out to the seller.  DON'T BUY!!"
1.0,Returned because it was too scratchy. Spending more time in “house clothes” due to COVID. This wasn’t up to my touchy feely standard. It is sure pretty and fit great. Made well enough too.
1.0,Was so excited about this piece and was sad to see how tiny it was when it arrived. I'm a L/XL and this dress fit my 13 niece that's a small. Super sad and will be returning.
1.0,"They break, I followed the two hands off and on method but they still break, I’ve bought 4 pairs of them and they all break"
1.0,Way bigger than they appear.  Very heavy.
1.0,Not the quality I have previously experienced with Lanz gowns. Flannel a cheaper quality; hem and stitching slipshod. Very disappointing
1.0,"This product is literally the crappiest thing I've ever ordered. My daughter got all of these for Christmas, and the strings all came untied out of the top, the buttons came off, and they didn't fit quite right. She only got to wear each pair once in good condition now they look like crap. Highly don't recommend these cuffs."
1.0,My fault for not realizing how small it was when I ordered it.  So small you can't tell there is a ball at all.
1.0,Looked great but broke after two days at the link connecting to the clasp (supposed to be stationary). Does NOT come with tool to size the links.
1.0,This dress is more like a long shirt and getting a refund has been difficult from the seller. You can not return this item to a kohls
1.0,"I returned this dress. Nothing like what the picture showed, except the color."
1.0,"Very disappointed. I’m the picture the pant legs look tapered, when they arrived, the legs are very flared. No what I wanted or expected. I ordered 2 pairs in different colors, sending them both back"
1.0,So disappointed that this came BROKEN in the package with no available return!!!
1.0,Over priced for a cheap cheap chain and thin fabric
1.0,It was cheap but also looked cheap.
1.0,Product does not even connect to the Fitbit any pressure applied disconnects the latching from the Fitbit itself on both sides. Total piece of junk. Avoid buying this
1.0,"Will never buy clothes again from Amazon.  VERY cheap looking.  Shipped direct from China.  So thin you could hold up and look through the entire blouse. Horrible, horrible horrible!!!"
1.0,"This sandal looks great but did not hold up. Velcro on both pair I bought tore off during third ware. I expected these to last three months, instead they lasted three days. I returned them and went with a more expensive brand. Guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,Broke apart the day after it was eligible for return. Disappointed to say the least. Very flimsy.
1.0,Not true to size..
1.0,Horrible quality!!! Balls kept falling off and wouldnt tighten all the way i would always be picking it up to put it back on. Would not buy again very disappointing
1.0,To tight nice fit if i was able to wear it so if u get it 2 sides up and the legs on the fit was to short
1.0,Beautiful Band but came apart in less then 2 weeks of wearing it and no refunds available.
1.0,Doesn't fit right.  Not as pretty in person.  Avoid!
1.0,They were cute sunglasses but they broke within two months
1.0,"The fit and the cut of this dress is very disappointing. The material has such deep set wrinkles that I can't get them out. Steam temporarily removes the wrinkles, but as it returns to room temperature, the wrinkles reappear."
1.0,These are pretty but they broke almost immediately. They were held together by rubber cement. Will not order from ever again.
1.0,Necklace broke as I was putting it on very cheap
1.0,Wasn't satisfied at all!<br />2 of the three pairs didn't match!<br />One flat topped gauge and one rounded<br />The other had a chip in it
1.0,For reference I am 5’8” 42D-39-45 dress size 16/18. I received the XXL and usually wear anything from an XL to XXL.<br /><br />A few things as soon as I was opening the package of this top I could feel the material and instantly thought to myself “oh no this is not going to be a quality top“ I could tell by the way it felt it just felt like a cheap type of material.<br /><br />However I still try the top on the photos look absolutely cute and I love cold shoulder blouses.<br /><br />Although it’s OK and fit it is definitely smaller than they indicate on their size chart. It was tied across the chest area and fits just OK. I highly recommend anyone getting this top to possibly go up a size if you want it to fit like the photo.<br /><br />If you get the XXL this is probably better suited for someone who is a smaller 14/16 at most in my opinion.<br /><br />So why the low rating?<br />I get really frustrated with these sellers who misrepresent products.<br />Sadly it runs small (not extremely but slightly) and the material is not comfortable.<br />It is also not as long as it shows in the photograph.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful to other shoppers here.
1.0,"You get what you pay for. This is itchy, frumpy and just not good looking at all. Spend the extra $7 dollars on a better one. Total junk!"
1.0,The quality of the jean material is very disappointing. Not a good fit.
1.0,"The plus is that the suit is mostly white or cream and the fabric feels good.<br />However... The lapel on the jacket and waistcoat are little flaps haphazardly sewn on. The dress shirt is a size for a child. There is a pocket square but there are absolutely no pockets, so thanks I guess.<br />Looks like Colonel Sanders with a tight Moon Knight mask. Apologies for the poor accompanying photo.<br />**Update, YOU HAVE TO PAY THE SHIPPING FEE TO RETURN - the return label from the seller did not include shipping, which USPS estimated at $35 from where I would be shipping from. I've reached out to Amazon Customer Service for support."
1.0,This quality of masks is very disappointing. My son broke one daily when he was at school. I can understand that it’s disposable. But it’s not gonna break like that. I don’t recommend it at all
1.0,Dress was misstiched like a mother and they refused to help. WASTE OF MONEY AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I sent in photos to show the issues and I never got a response after they requested them! Waste of money.
1.0,"Waste of money. I am a bigger woman and these scarfs DO NOT stay on your face, not even a few minutes. I have had other things I have been wearing and unfortunately missed my return window."
1.0,I purchased this for my sister in law for Christmas.  She is a petite girl but likes her t-shirts a little large so I ordered this in a large.  It was way too small.  Even a XXXL wouldn't have fit her.  Very disappointed in the vast disparity between the size I was expecting and what I got.
1.0,This was supposed to fit a 40d or dd and there was no way it was fitting at all!!!
1.0,The material is sheer.
1.0,The size was too big and the seller refused to send the return label. This was not clear when I bought it. Be careful when buying this item. You will have to pay more if you need to return it.
1.0,It claimed in description it fits toddlers  definitely to big
1.0,This was supposed to be for a child. It is too big for adults. Absolute waste of money.
1.0,Cheap fabric... washed up horrible! Doesn’t hold its shape...
1.0,did not like!!! i ordered an XL & still didnt fit right ! which sucks bc it was for a concert! definitely if you have a big bust it’s a no go
1.0,Looks cheaply made!
1.0,It's cute but I'm a little disappointed that my navel has a big green spot under it now. Not really the look I was going for but who am I to judge if that's what some people are into. Will pass on buying from this seller again to avoid future bouts of what appears to be the beginnings of a disgusting skin disorder.
1.0,"Adidas logo was missing from the hat, seems to be a ripoff or bootleg"
1.0,"This suit would be great for anyone with a flat chest. According the the size chart I should've ordered a 12, I ordered a 16. The suit itself fit my upper body just fine but the cups are practically nonexistent. I wear a 36D and the underwire in the suit fit under my breasts but there is no depth to the cups at all. Maybe it would be good for someone who wears a A ?? The suit was completely flat and the only depth was given by the padding in the suit. Even with the padding removed there wasn't any depth to the cups"
1.0,After being washed this top became a short swing top instead of a long swing top.  Very very disappointing.<br />:(
1.0,This turn too
1.0,This bag ripped within a month where strap attaches to side...this bag won't hold weight of what you need to carry... it's not worth the money for sure!!!
1.0,"The material to this is thin and cheap.  There’s no lining.  The jacket pattern is AWFUL.  The arm hole and sleeves are ENORMOUS, causing it to be bulky and shapeless around the shoulders and chest.  The sleeves are also about three or four inches too long.  With no lining, you can’t even roll them up, you just expose the stitching.  It’s like it was made by someone who had never seen a human body, just been vaguely described the shape of one and then did their best.  It’s horribly unflattering for something that should have been tailored."
1.0,Looks way too faded nothing like the pic shown.
1.0,IT WAS  WRAP  TO TIGHT..  S. WRAPED.. OF ALL THINGS.. SO WRINKED  U HAVE TO WASH IT BEFORE YOU EVEN WEAR IT.. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN....  AND THE LOOK OF IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT ADV.... DO NOT BUY THIS MESS..  MADE IN YOU GUESS IT..  CHINA!!!!!!!!!  MORE TRASH!!!!!!
1.0,They were packed like they didn’t care.<br />To small. Cheap. Took forever to get here just to be disappointed.
1.0,Uncomfortable; wouldn’t refund
1.0,Not what I expected. Looks different than what I got
1.0,"Cute, but broke before I even got them on my ear"
1.0,Terrible socks!  They are too small (I wear sz 10).  There is so much stitching on the onside it was difficult not to get my toes hung up on it while I was trying to put the socks on.  They are very thin.  I wouldn't recommend these socks and won't buy this brand again.
1.0,Was really excited to get this necklace but when I took out of the bag it fell apart. I got a refund without a problem.
1.0,"The glass is distorted in every pair. Cute frames, but a waste of money"
1.0,Looks extremely cheap.  I will never buy jewelry over the Internet after purchasing this product!
1.0,"I wish this actually fit the Versa. I don’t know if I got a poorly manufactured one or if this is the regular quality of this brand, but both parts of the leather are too big to fit in the versa’s openings. I change bands a couple times a week so I definitely know how to change them (and it regularly only takes me 5 minutes) but I messed with this product for over an hour and couldn’t get it to fit in my Versa no matter what angle, position or amount of force I used."
1.0,Too small. Cheap material
1.0,"These glasses look nothing like the picture, I'm thinking I was sent the wrong pair...."
1.0,Liked the shorts until I wore then for 1 hour and the zipper broke.  So embarrassed
1.0,Nothing I found it was too small so I recommend anybody that's going to buy any night gown out of amazon that you look at the size chart because the clothes that come from China or made in China are very small comparable to the clothes that we have here in the US so I just gave it to my little sister and she loves it
1.0,I could not use it.  Couldn't figure out how.  Too short to fit around suitcase.  A waste of my money
1.0,"I have a big face, but these lenses were HUGE. And I have already previously owned a pair from the same company, but for some reason they made these bigger. The psuedo leather was also sub standard and I had to return them because they were just not presentable or practical."
1.0,The strap broke I mailed it back on 8/31 it’s 9/3 haven’t received refund yet.
1.0,"These do not fit as expected. They are made of a very stiff fabric, and have a very boxy shape. They are something I would expect a grandma to wear. I returned."
1.0,Too small. You need to put on the product to order one size up. Terrible.
1.0,The lenses popped out the first time I wore them.
1.0,I have tried for weeks and can't get them to stay on ANY mask. Cannot recommend.
1.0,The ties for these were in the back and not the front!!.  So bizarre and I had to return them.  Having said that they were comfortable to wear.... if you like wearing your clothes back to front!
1.0,"Do not order these they are a waste of money! Light and thin, super cheap quality and cheaply made. They are not comfortable at all, for horrible and sizing charts are way off."
1.0,The product was very cute but the plugs on the back were weak and were breaking off it was also missing the chains.
1.0,Doesn’t deserve one star
1.0,"Very different than picture , looks really chip"
1.0,Haven't used it to hike with yet and the stiching on the outer pockets are ripping.  Not one pocket but three(((wait.five holes after taking photos)))). Nothing but a small water bottle will fit unless packed inside. The zippers aren't well made and come undone easily on all pockets with barely anything in them. Just junk unless your packing for one night and not using anything but the inside.
1.0,The earrings feel apart after the first use 😩
1.0,"This is no way a man watch, can barely hook the first hole on the band."
1.0,"cheaply made, not like the picture at all. Material was cheap and flimsy, coming apart at the seems. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1.0,This product looks nothing like the picture. It has no size tag in it it is a flat pink a very light pink it's see-through it's a very cheap t-shirt. This dress looks speckled in the picture and I have bought one before from a different company that was speckled like this picture. This is a terrible terrible product.
1.0,Was disappointed on how much smaller this was in person. The pictures are very deceiving . I do not recommend this if you are looking for a big bag .
1.0,This is not worth $5 let alone $15. The hood is perforated - that's how they claim you can see through it. There was pink dye from the eyes that clearly rubbed off on other parts of the white hood. I was incredibly disappointed in this. The hood is also super tight - I have a small head and fine hair and still struggled to get this thing on. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1.0,These are very cheaply made and arrived bent. We returned.
1.0,"I did not like the pockets. They are long and show through fabric. Nice looking, but to thin of fabric for my taste."
1.0,Super thin and didn't fit well. I got them for my little brother and they were terrible.
1.0,"Not strong enough for your average 7 year old, it broke in 1 day"
1.0,This has to be the worst thing I’ve ever ordered in my life. The material is the literal swimsuit material like I can go swimming in this. The skirt is extremely long way longer than the picture and it looks awful. The shirt Doesn’t have the lettuce lining like it says it does in the description. It’s just some straight across. The shirt hanging weird on the boobs. I’m not gonna lie it does look a lot better than it is in the photo. In person it looks like I’m a pink Mormon going to her Mormon school graduation swim party. It is just the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I ordered this for a party to go to and now I might just stay home and cry instead. Not to mention the shirt is literally signed my armpits into three pieces. Please for the love of God do not buy this it is awful and it’s clearly a scam. I am so disappointed with this purchase and hope I could figure out how to return it.
1.0,"Do not buy this watch. Bought it once, came with the second hand broken. Gave them the benefit of the doubt, ordered a replacement. It randomly would stop or run late. It’s a cute watch, but it doesn’t keep time."
1.0,Awkward fit.  Cuts too close to armpit.  Thread came apart with first try on because arm straps are too tight.  Too annoyed to return.
1.0,"I am disappointed that this photo key chain is too small for my granddaughter's school photo,"
1.0,Broke after not many wears...would not recommend.
1.0,The chain was broken/defected when I got it.
1.0,I can't even begin to put into words the extreme disappointment in this product.  It was a Christmas gift for my daughter and I can't believe I spent $35 on this $5 piece of crap...huge waste of money.
1.0,For merino wool its a little too itchy begging the question of the merino wool authenticity claim.  Worked well enough in colder temps though<br />Now that there is a small hole (that seems logical enough to be from their silk screening) showing up just after washing I am kinda POd that I didn't send it back when it came.
1.0,Dress was not what I expected. it fits like a shirt and is tight from the arms. I'm a short girl and on the plus side but this still fit horrible. Very unhappy with the item.
1.0,Its is way too tall and moves around on your head.  You can't fold it over because of the ear piece. You need to be a cone head for it to fit correctly.
1.0,This looked cute on the girl in the picture. The material is thin and a scratchy feeling. I will have to wear a tank top under it. I got what I paid for. It HAS to be washed on delicate. I probably will not be wearing more than 2-3 times.
1.0,The rubber smells like gasoline. I tried to deodorize these but nothing helped.
1.0,Shoe looked great online but when it arrived it was nothing like the display picture. Cheap material and horrible finish. Disappointed with this Qupid item!
1.0,"Adjuster is not stable, which causes item to slide off."
1.0,Too hot. Did not breath well at all. Felt like i was inhaling hot warm stale air. I had to purchase different masks when i realized these were not practical to wear all day for virus protection
1.0,"Avoid this mask, as the seller never sends it and won't respond to emails. A scam product. ZERO stars."
1.0,"arrived shattered, twice..."
1.0,"The black material is like nylon--very form fitting. Additionally, it was WAY TOO SMALL. I'm normally a 16 in dresses w/ a 38C cup size, so I ordered a 2x just to test out how big it is...It barely it over my chest. The sleeves fit well, but everything else was way too small. I returned it and ordered a 4x because the dress is THAT cute...hopefully it works out.<br />Update: I ordered another one and it fit. But the sleeve were too big. You can tell it’s cheap material Bc it’s rowme—so I’m not too mad about the quality. The black the part of the dress feels like bathing suit material btw."
1.0,Ordered a M but seems like a larger fitting when worn.<br />Buy a size smaller than what you regularly wear
1.0,"It’s a scam! They show as if the earrings are big in the pictures available but in reality they were so tiny ANDDD the work on them was half done, like from the front it had decoration but from the back there was nothing at all like a painting half done.! Was mad!!! Would not even give them 1 star but had to let you all know!"
1.0,I thought that it was great. Until the snap broke in the first use. The snap actually came apart in two pieces. Sent for return.
1.0,Ugly jacket. Fits way too big. Ordered a L received a size 20. Still hanging in my in my closet. Can't use it
1.0,belt broke after a month of wearing it.
1.0,"Way too big. I can’t return or exchange, return window closed"
1.0,The name was spelt wrong. When I tried to return they sent me a label with no postage that cost more in shipping to return than I paid for the necklace
1.0,"Tried everything to get these to work, and they don't."
1.0,Very poor quality and not as expected. Don’t waste your money and time. I will return it I didn’t even try it
1.0,Small! Not worth it
1.0,They didn't have lace holes on one shoe. I had to return them.
1.0,"Too small to fit on the average woman’s legs. The stretchy bits work, but the lace at the top cuts the circulation out of my legs"
1.0,Already broken! Gabbage....
1.0,Doesn’t deserve any stars.  Bought one.  Tore first timed used.  Returned it.  Same thing happened with new one.  Terrible quality in material and workmanship.
1.0,Stone was much smaller than depicted.
1.0,Ordered my normal size and these were way big... baggy in the waist AND legs. Sizing is off clearly...
1.0,What I got was absolutely nothing like the picture and it wasn't even the right size. Talk about false advertising.
1.0,The color was not even close and the fit was completely off
1.0,The brim is so flimsy it won’t stand up. If you snap the sides in to stand up the font and back won’t  form a curve. It’s packed folded in 4s and the creases won’t come out so the brim stays creased in the wrong places. The head piece is cheap thin material. Not a quality product.
1.0,"Very comfortable.  Lots of pockets.  No need to carry a purse when wearing these. I am updating my review because I had them for two months when several of the seams came apart, the closure at the waist popped off in the wash and the material  just split.  It was not at a seam it was in the front of the pants.  The fit was good so these things didn't happen because they were too tight.  They just didn't hold up.  I purchased several other shorts at the same time that have been just fine.  I guess the quality on these is just not there."
1.0,Ours arrived crumpled and is super cheap. I wouldn’t even pay $1 for this item.
1.0,To small so mad
1.0,"The recommendation was to order one size larger - yeah, maybe 3.  Also, the picture makes the jacket look much more ""rich"" than it actually is.  It's just a cheap Walmart-like costume.  Do not waste your money."
1.0,Didnt get product!
1.0,These mittens are not embroidered at all.  They have a poorly stamped photo on each mitten.  The mittens are a flimsy piece of badly cut fabric.  So Disappointing !!
1.0,When I put it in it tore easily - would not recommend
1.0,Cheap. Broke off as I gently placed it on fabric.
1.0,Havent used til recently dont think manufacturers  thought it would be took off and on  repetitive  broke within first week also will not let me upload broken  part
1.0,Dress was way too short and is pretty see thru. Would not recommend this
1.0,"Feels like more or less the same friction as bare skin on my LGG Saturn. It could be good for on other surfaces, but I am not satisfied. I would return it, but I've already worn it. I bought it because it didn't have any GOOFY design on it like skypad, but perhaps those ones might be better. Also, the elastic seems to already be stretching despite following instructions on the card.<br /><br />My one star rating for this product means ""I wouldn't recommend to a friend"""
1.0,Ridiculously expensive
1.0,The product was broken
1.0,This shirt is definitely NOT red. It is very very very PINK. Fits well but the color is awful.
1.0,"I like the affordable price but the quality is not good. It is not worth it. The size runs small. I got an xl and it was too tight, usually xl is roomy for me. The letters stretch out when you wear it, see picture for example. Overall I'm highly disappointed considering everyone else gave it glowing reviews."
1.0,Bad quality. Nothing like what the photo on the web looks like.
1.0,A couple of wipes to clean the lens and UV coating rubbed off. I am a sunglass connoisseur so I know how to clean glasses. What is weird I have yellow coated ones and they are good to go after many cleanings? Stay away from blue coating....
1.0,This necklace is much bigger than I expected. It's about the size of a Christmas tree ornament. I'll probably remove the chain and just use it on my Christmas tree.
1.0,This itrm fitted too small for the size I chose.
1.0,Mine does not glow in the dark even after sitting in the sun on the dash of my car all day.
1.0,"I bought exact same pant size, brand and style from Costco. Loved the pants so much I decided to try and find on amazon. I did. however pants do not fit the same. Annoyed at having to pay $5 to return. Not my fault you guys can't measure correctly."
1.0,Don’t like the colors
1.0,Cheaply made lasted less than a month. Not worth the money never buy again.
1.0,Not so good fitting..polyester type..I didn’t like the cloth quality
1.0,"Ordered a size small, and I had to recheck the package because I thought they sent a child’s small. Wouldn’t even fit my wife who is tiny tiny. Fit my 5 year old daughter."
1.0,"Don’t buy! Material is super cheap, socks have no shape, no ankle seam, too big. Waste of money."
1.0,"I love the look of this ring, but the seams on the bands make it look really cheap and ruin it for me. I am returning."
1.0,The item I received is not this. It is completely fake and also horrible fake quality and they refuse to give me back my full refund. I will be filing a claim. Don't buy from him. See pictures.
1.0,"it broke in 2 weeks, don't buy it now good, you will loose your time and money"
1.0,"I wish I'd have read the reviews before I purchased this. I agree with another that it is nothing like the picture. I expected it to be ""sweatshirt"" cotton material because the title of the product has ""sweatshirt"". Not true. It is a silky material and the tag says 95% polyester 5% spandex. The hems are nothing like the picture so I took a few of my own to show you. Also, the red sleeve isn't red. It's orange-red. It fit on the small side."
1.0,don't waste your money.  ends fell apart and unravelled in one week!  a five year could make a better one!  I emailed company and asked for a replacement and they never sent it.
1.0,"I got my band 4 days ago, and the finish is already wearing off. I love the style, clasp and pattern, but it's going to be worn out pretty quick."
1.0,Not the same color and fit is extremely weird
1.0,There not Sterling silver  and they don't have a ball at the end they turned in nose green and im have to bend them not worth the money in fact I think they charged me to much
1.0,"To say the absolute least, this was AWFUL. Horrible quality, the seams didn't even make sense. Not in the slightest bit wearable. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
1.0,Despite the adjustable positions they were too large for my ears and didn't look right. They also arrived bent due to flimsy packaging. Seemed rather cheap and low end for the price -- like something I'd buy at Target or Charming Charlies. Not impressed. Returned item.
1.0,The sleeves were so tight I couldn't possibly wear the dress!<br />I'm extremely disappointed in nor receiving a credit to my account!
1.0,Not the right size. These must be on kids size
1.0,The neck opening was very small and it was poorly made.
1.0,Tight under the arms... dress isn’t as long as I would have liked it... and it looks cheap😫😫<br />Wore it to my bff wedding and I almost cried when I put it on...<br />Shipping was pretty good
1.0,"Received item today, was broken upon arrival."
1.0,"I am a true size 11.5 in women's and have to typically purchase a size 12 in women's to fit.  Initally purchased the Sansha in size 14 per their sizing chart.  Once arrived it was too small so I reordered the same shoe one size up (sz 15.)  Once arrived it was felt just like the size 14 had felt, too short.  Measured the length of the 14 and 15 and they are the exact same length.  The sizing in the shoe states otherwise as one labeled 14 and one 15 but they both measure exact same length!!!  Will return both and not taking any more chances as shipping was not free."
1.0,It was 2 sizes too small. Size 14 was more like a size 10
1.0,Loved the product for about 30 min until it snapped and was useless.
1.0,"The pants I received after neatly two weeks, were completely different then the picture.  They were high waisted and and a different color. I had to go to USPS to return them and it was $28 to send to China , so, I took the loss.  VERY UNHAPPY"
1.0,"El peor reloj del mundo! No me duró ni un día. La hebilla se rompió la segunda vez que me lo puse. Además, la parte interior de la correa estaba pelándose. Horrible! He tenido relojes por la mitad de precio y no eran tan malos."
1.0,"I was so excited to get these to use as sun visors when walking around outside, I was very disappointed in the quality of the visor which was made out of a thick sock like material and was only wide enough to cover half of my face. This would be good for a stuffed animal or a small child but not a woman"
1.0,I ordered this product for a Friend) when I received the product I was so ashamed I to gifted it to my friend I put it right back in the box and return it back. So small like a hairline
1.0,"Gift for a birthday - she loved it at first sight, but then it turned her neck green within 3 wearings. Poor quality."
1.0,Returned as it was too small and material was thin
1.0,I wish I had never ordered the shirts it is the worst shirts I have ever ordered the graphics are awful . Unfortunately I ordered 2 shirts I ordered them on August 10 and just got them now August 28 and I'm so disappointed.
1.0,Not like picture. Black lens
1.0,"Not flattering, looks more like a maternity dress"
1.0,99.9% sure these are glass. Every one is exactly the same. There are no color variations or pattern variations. And they don't have the energy that real gemstones have. They are dead. I am very disappointed.
1.0,"More of a fluorescent 1980s disco pink than a hot pink, add to that the freaky shoulder pads, thin t-shirt material, and near crop length and this is a hard no."
1.0,"Tried product as soon as it arrived, followed directions, went to use included brush and it was in pieces."
1.0,My charm turn...this is not real silver....highly disappointed
1.0,Roses are too bulky :/
1.0,"This was ordered for a tween 12 years old, it was so tiny, it would fit a 5 year old!!! Very dissapointed!!!"
1.0,It looks cute but it arrived wet and smells moldy. I don’t have time to exchange. Washing it in hopes that it cleans up<br />Ok and if not I’m returning it. Still grosses me out that it smells and is wet.
1.0,These are the perfect size to leave in for upper piercings.  Just as described though the backs are a bit loose and I wish that they had locking backs for more secure wear.<br /><br />Update:  After wearing these for just a week the finish started to wear off and look corroded.  They have started to irritate skin.  While I have sensitive skin I would really expect that they would last longer than a week.  If you just need them for very occasional use they might be ok otherwise my advise would be to pass on these and find another option.
1.0,"Buenos días, lamentablemente me mandaron unas gafas para sol guess 6747 cuando la q yo quería era una gafa de sol guess 6744,no son lo mismo, no me gustan si no tenían mejor me lo hubieran dicho, no estoy conforme"
1.0,"Very pretty - but it broke before I had a chance to wear it. I put it on and a few minutes later it fell off - one of the pins holding the links together was either broken when it arrived, or, was never made properly.  Very sad."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture<br />Made of cheaper material and sizing runs too small
1.0,I loved the earrings but they arrived broken
1.0,"Not clear,very hard to<br />Figure out where to find  the place to<br />Type the name in."
1.0,Piece of junk. Bought two neither lasted more than a day. Waste of money
1.0,Hate the material does not fit right in bottem area35% cotton 65% polyester feels like a thick Jersey
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4f54d9b8127bd1db0b598cca970238fc]]
1.0,Too expensive for that price
1.0,"i bought this for my teenaged son. We both laughed when he tried it on -- he said ""It looks like a garbage bag"". Returned."
1.0,"Looks cheap not worth the price, looks nice in the pictures not when you get to look in real"
1.0,Nothing like the colors in the picture!
1.0,This product is a waste of money. These shirts must be seconds or thirds<br />One shirt was so small I could not get over my head<br />One shirt had sleeves that were at least 6 inches longer than the rest<br />One shirt collar was almost twice the size of the others<br />And one shirt was actually so short it would not tuck into my pants
1.0,The size runs small and they are bent.
1.0,"This looks very cool in the pic. But this is for very, very small ears. It would've fit a child's ear. I thought maybe I was supposed to stretch it out. But when I tried to gently stretch it, it snapped in two. It looks much larger in the pic, with no dimensions in the description. :-("
1.0,Misleading advertising NOT as promised! Paid over 100. dollars for pants I already own and paid less from a high end retailer in LA. Very inconvenienced and very upset as I do not have time for nonsense!!!
1.0,Way too thin.  More like a slip or under garment.
1.0,listed as 2x but was more like extra small
1.0,I ordered the 5-6yr size and it fits my 3 year old
1.0,"The item is not really as pictured. Instead of 1 cuff that is large enough for an adult, I received 2 tiny, thin, poorly shaped cuffs that would never fit me. I'm very disappointed, but returning it would cost more than I would get back."
1.0,We ordered a 13 little kid and received an 11.5. my little girl was in tears! These were a big treat since they are so expensive for kid shoes and now we have to return them and she doesn't get to wear them to a family event.
1.0,I dislike the fact that this product wasn't an extra large but fit more like a medium. It was extremely small
1.0,"It’s really cute. But it runs way smaller than what’s on-line conversion. Also, to return it costs more than the item. The seller gave me a 30% refund and they let me keep item to give to my “smaller” friend.  If you order just go up a couple sizes."
1.0,"Love how thick and soft these are, but the second pack I ordered came with a weird inappropriate print - the banana print undies have weird fishhook piercings, perfectly aligned with the vertical center of the back and front. Bizarre and disturbing to find in a pack of little girls panties.  This supplier should be banned.  (See photos.)"
1.0,Absolute junk!!!! They broke the second time my month old son wore them!!<br />We found better quality at Walmart (sad) !!<br />Do not purchase !! Junk !!<br />Complete choking hazard !!!
1.0,"I am 5'4, 115 lbs, about a 24&#34; waist, these did not fit me at all. They were super baggy. The material is that slinky material cheap dresses are made out of."
1.0,There was blood on my shirt and I never even put it on yet. How disgusting!!!
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:a61036cb8070d185c1d6ef62d40af6a0]] The whole point of cargo anything is that it has lots of pockets that are actually functional. Given that, these are not cargo shorts at all. These are so ridiculous I had to make a video. The front pockets are interrupted by the seam of the second set of front pockets, making them useless. None of the pockets are deep enough to fit a regular size smart phone, let alone an oversized one. The back pockets aren’t even real; literally nonexistent—just a decorative flap. This product is a joke. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone looking for actual cargo shorts; furthermore, the pockets are even less useful than many regular shorts I have. One star without any doubt. See video and pics. This is a horribly designed mess."
1.0,"I received this pill box hat quickly, yet I never wore it. It looks so cheap, it could not possibly go well with the rest of my outfit- any outfit. I was embarrassed to wear it to the funeral. It is made with cheap materials, too small and too shallow.<br />Don't recommend. Looks more like a detail of a halloween costume."
1.0,Gifted to my Mom and they hurt her ears and tarnished right away.
1.0,"This dress, as pretty as the picture is, looked so cheap. It was hard to put on because of the way it is made with the cape type sleeves."
1.0,The zipper is very flimsy won’t stay put keeps falling down
1.0,"Worst product ever, broke one day after buying! Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,Too heavy to wear comfortably for any length of time.
1.0,Falls off if I move my arm too quickly or with the lightest bump against something.<br /><br />Otherwise it looks great and feels great.
1.0,I have small hands. Only about 2 rings fit & they look very cheap. I was holding rings in one hand while I tried them on. The hand I was holding rings in was green afterwards.<br /><br />Would not recommend. I won’t be wearing these.
1.0,"The fit was very small and the item came with the underwire poking through. That being said, it may have been a fluke but the fit just wasn’t good. I recommend sizing up if you give this a try."
1.0,I like these kind of bands but this one is changing color after wearing for only nine days.
1.0,Very uncomfortable you can feel the pull after buying this  I eventually worked up the courage to get the piercing it’s not near as bad as what you think just get the piercing it’s easy to hide you can push it up in your nose just make sure your balls are tightened
1.0,They are small. Keep falling out of the frames.
1.0,Worked great but when I opened it to replace the battery the hands fell off inside the face it’s now useless and too small for just anyone to fux
1.0,Not supper dark as advertised
1.0,I bought this bag a few years ago and have never been quite satisfied with it. The zipper gets stuck. The end with the wheels isn't elevated enough so the fabric rubs the ground and got worn very easily. The handles flop around because there is nothing to hold them together. I would not buy this again.
1.0,This bag is paper thin and cheap.  Cheap looking and cheap feel ... not worth $17
1.0,"The strap broke after wearing it only a few times. Because the band is very stiff and it was a challenge to wear daily so I didn’t use it much. As bad luck has it, the strap broke after my return period expired, and there is no way to contact seller. I should have worn it more it would have broke sooner. Poor quality I’m not sure it was leather backing."
1.0,Don’t buy! Material is cheap!
1.0,Shirt fit weird stripes don’t line up and it is some disgusting thin weird fabric.
1.0,Ugly dress.  Heavy material -
1.0,Fell apart after wearing for couple of hours
1.0,Nunca llegó y no es la primera vez
1.0,"It's very uncomfortable. I really tried hard to like this fake ring but it hurts too much! It really pushes in to your nose, I thought it was gonna stab through. I even tried switching it but it still stabbed in. It's also a little hard to put on. Overall, it's just not good. If you want a fake piercing Don't buy this product!! It's a waste of money that is painful for your nose! Look into other products for a fake nose piercing because this isn't it! Also, it feels very cheap."
1.0,Looks cheap and doesn’t fit right
1.0,"I usually wear a 2x, this top runs very small. I had to return it."
1.0,The dress is a stretchy material and is much larger than expected. It is also a faded black color. It does not look like it does in the photograph.
1.0,"The color of the blouse is perfect.<br />the quality is very poor and it fits very oddly.<br />I guess it will be ok with, but I do not recommend the product."
1.0,The sizing is way off and the material is like the cheap Halloween costumes at Walmart.
1.0,Band looked great...appeared to be well made...tools were a plus. About three months after putting it on my watch the clasp would not stay fastened...watch falls off. Buy a better band.
1.0,Received Black Watch kilt in bag marked Black & Gray. Doubt I will order again from this vendor if they can't label items properly. Replacement please.
1.0,Haven’t tried it on. Threw it in bottom if closet!<br />I may wear later as a nightgown
1.0,Right leg was shorter than the left.
1.0,"The cotton material used here is cheap, scratchy and itchy.<br />I returned it."
1.0,"These are NOT threaded properly. They screw on fine but when I went to take them off, they would NOT unscrew. I have owned threaded tunnels before that I had absolutely no issues with, so it was not user error. To get these off it took me, my boyfriend, and PLIERS to unscrew."
1.0,If I could give this product 0 stars I would! This left me with out a Halloween outfit the day of !!! When I got this outfit the zipper was hard to zip but nothing seemed wrong with it just stiff well the day of the zipper decided it just wouldn’t zip at ALL ! There is nothing visibly wrong with the zipper it just will not zip up at all!!! The thickness isn’t that thick you can see underwear lines and if you were pasties you can see them underneath! Completely a waste and wouldn’t suggest anyone buys this !
1.0,Don't buy this product
1.0,Weren’t breathable and light like they said in the description. Wasn’t put together well. Cheaply made.
1.0,"Shirt is low quality, and screen print is crooked. I expected it to be straight for the price."
1.0,Not for tall or med size females.... too small. Made for Asian body size.  The reviews are written by employers!
1.0,Too short.  Not at all like the picture
1.0,Too bad they won’t allow zero stars. The trim on the neckline is crooked and the material is puckered. I am returning the shirt and have to pay the return shipping cost in addition to paying the original shipping cost. You would think they would cover the return shipping since the item is defective. I just looked up the cost to ship this back to China and it will cost more to return it than it did to buy it! What a rip off!
1.0,Quality is subpar.  The size was extremely small even for my child.  We returned the item as it was useless for us.
1.0,The product didnt look like the picture. The frames were different bulkier then the picture advertised.
1.0,Super cheapy
1.0,Wasn’t a good fit at all
1.0,"Was too big & I didn’t like the material. What isn’t good for me, may be great for someone else."
1.0,I didn't receive the band in the photo.
1.0,The lining fell apart after only wear once! Waste of money.
1.0,"The material is not leather. It is the most cheap plastic.<br />Plastic is ok. But, the price should not be $33..."
1.0,Horrible material. Chipped easily
1.0,"never buy unknown brands, sizes does not match :("
1.0,it was really stretchy and fit for the most part but was sheer and didn't really form to my curves but made me look fatter
1.0,"Completely fell apart, the teeth came off and it just fell apart in our hand. Very disappointed. Want refund."
1.0,Necklace is beautiful and my stepdaughter loved it but the clasp broke after she had it for a month.
1.0,Doesnt work for pregnancy !! Too tight<br />I do not recomend at all
1.0,This is a very very cheap iron on decal on a cheap Gildan t-shirt. This seller is savvy in jumping on the Ted Lasso hype ahead of Halloween… but would definitely not pay $20 for a cheap t shirt like this.
1.0,These shoes are horrible. My son has worn them for about six weeks and they look awful. They didn’t make it one week before they started to break down.  I’m too embarrassed to send my son to school in his “new” school shoes.  I’ll have to throw these in the garbage and buy a different pair of shoes.  I’m very disappointed.
1.0,"Cute bag, however I’ve only had it 5 months and the zipper broke already!"
1.0,The cut and shape of this kimono was as expected but the pattern is absolutely not as pictured. Am returning and am pretty disappointed.
1.0,I ordered the correct size which is a Large and a Small came in.
1.0,Took forever to come in and when they did come in the were thin and the consistency of swim shorts.
1.0,"Am unable to comment as the Pianillo pack is a gift to be presented in early May. Thanks, for your inquiry."
1.0,Sorry I wasted my Money not worth time and money to return
1.0,Arrived broken :/
1.0,It was tarnished and the quality is poor. It was inexpensive so you get what you pay for.
1.0,Wish I could give 0 stars. The balls on the piercings are like.... glued on. Cant get them off. Worst buy EVER.
1.0,Very very pretty but broke immediately 😫.
1.0,Does not looks as on the photo. Cheap and big. Not cute.
1.0,What a great pair of socks... if the were sized correctly... I wear a 12 to 12 1/2 shoe. I could not get the toe of the sock over my foot. This was either a small sock put in the wrong package or the sock company has no idea what a size 12 let alone 14 is... sadly I just tried them on and the expiration for the return expired
1.0,Absolute trash.  These bags are way to small to use as grocery bags.  Totally useless!!
1.0,It's barely covering everything and it's awkward looking despite fitting the size. It looks small like I am trying too hard to squeeze into it because the cleavage has no place to go. The cut is angled weird under the armpits.
1.0,Diamonds were missing when I received my package
1.0,Not at all Capri length. Fabric is very thick.
1.0,It didn't work with the type of glasses 👓 I were
1.0,"I had some high hopes because thw fabric is very smooth and silky. The design is really pretty too, but after three weeks of normal wear it is already pilling and looks rough and worn. Its a shame. I haven't worn its in water and always remove it when bathing, washing dishes, etc."
1.0,"Not like the picture at all, too short."
1.0,"I originally like the item a little, although it was a cheaply molded item after 3 days of having it both clasps broke and it is not very durable"
1.0,"The jacket I received looked NOTHING like the pictures advertised. This is an extremely cheap quality jacket.  The sleeves were 3/4 inch sleeves and the jacket sat just above my hips.  I'm 5'6, extremely disappointed."
1.0,This was my second time wearing it. It was a little see through. A little thin but form fitting. It ripped down my butt while I was in the gym. If you want to be embarrassed get it.
1.0,These gloves ripped in three different places. They have only been worn a handful of times. They are of very poor quality.
1.0,"I ordered this thinking I was ordering a full dress & when it came, it was only the skirt. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,Product was not what I expected. Was suppose to stretch instep and throat.will not even open wide enough to stretch toe box.
1.0,Very thin material. Hou can i send it back?
1.0,"Very poorly made. As soon as I opened the package a pieceteeny tiny bolt went flying off of it. When I finally found the said  teeny tiny bolt, I tried putting it back on but it wouldn't stay. Even if it had stayed the ring is sooo thick you really can't wear it, not to mention it is extremely hard to open. Not sure if there is an original one out there that is better made, wish I could find it. This is being returned.<br />*tip* Do not open on a marbled countertop next to a toaster you haven't cleaned under recently."
1.0,"Way to small, like children sizes"
1.0,This fit nice everywhere except the bust. I have this suit in other colors but this particular one had the cups sewn in irregular and had a hole where the cups were attached to the suit.
1.0,It looked like clown glasses. Way too big.
1.0,Product is a faded black mask (looks red now) with red print on it. Not a high quality mask that I was expecting. Would not recommend.
1.0,The material was not as expected. Stated Prime and guaranteed to return. No mailing label was provided. The message stated return approved but never received a label. Not able to return. No UPS code was provided no USPS label was provided. impossible to return. If at all in doubt DO NOT BUY.
1.0,This coat is warm but the filling of the coat is coming through the entire coat. It is hard to explain but I give this coat a bad review. I had high expectations for it and if they could take care of that issue it would be a great coat.
1.0,This dress is very small as if for a very short petite person.
1.0,"Junk, scratches far to easy and the lense coating is garbage"
1.0,This mask wasn’t designed very well couldn’t see out the eyes well at all.
1.0,"The band was cheap, poorly made, and would not attach to the fit bit so it will NEVER work"
1.0,"I returned this.  Even though I bought it in other colors, this one was too tight.  Not to mention too short."
1.0,Very cheap made and smelly
1.0,It was already broken (no handle!) when I open the box. Also no dust bag!
1.0,"I bought these based on Amazon reviews.  Perhaps the supplier has changed, as my pair isn't all that great.  I bought my usual waist size but these are very tight.  In addition, two of the pocket liners were actually sewn into the crotch seam and were unusable until I carefully cut them free from the stitching.  I'd advise you to look elsewhere for cargo shorts."
1.0,The shoes are beautiful and fit exactly as expected but both heels broke completely off the third time I wore them. Save your time and money and buy shoes somewhere else.
1.0,The material can only be for punishment.  Returned
1.0,"I am very disappointed! From light use, the vase broke after a week. After gluing it, the chain broke off."
1.0,Very cheap looking and ugly in person.  This is not worth $10!!
1.0,"this material is cheap not like the other brands, also I couldn't fit this over my head without pulling down very hard, then it was so tight on face couldn't even wear, they barely fit my daughter."
1.0,Ordered a Xl not enough length for a beach cover up
1.0,"When I went to pull it out of the package, it broke."
1.0,Nice and good fit
1.0,Really did not work. Ditched it before I even left the house for my event. Followed the directions to a T.<br />I'm a D cup. I read reviews of larger chested women wearing this successfully but I was not one of them.
1.0,I used this spray on a new pair of Birkenstocks and they are now streaked and look awful!!!!!
1.0,"The earrings in the picture are NOT what I received.  In the description and picture, they are silver toned.  The earrings I received were gold tone, the stones were not the colors pictured and they were extremely cheaply made.  Disappointed to say the least."
1.0,Ive bought 2 of these and the clasps that attach the band to the watch have fell apart on both. I wouldn't reccomend unless you buy the clasps from aomeone else
1.0,"So...I was at a birthday party last night. After using the restroom, I was tightening the belt when everything that wasn't leather fell apart. EVERYTHING. The buckle ended up falling in the toilet. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"That’s it, cute enough watch, but it was dead and The seconds hand was loose. Oh well $5 watch."
1.0,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend for Christmas, it snapped and flew all over the place while gently sitting on her wrist an hour after putting it on, poor quality, save yourself the disappointment and steer clear! Thankfully Amazon was quick & professional about refunding as always."
1.0,"Very small, I ordered a size up from what I normally wear but they are at least a size too small."
1.0,I've worn it for only 1 day as it's already turned GREEN! They are not made of the material listed in the description.
1.0,"Cheap, and tarnished quickly"
1.0,Overall size is very small and uncomfortable.
1.0,"Way too long, cheapaterial, forever shipping, looks more like bathrobe."
1.0,"This is NOT a sickle, it’s a scythe. They’re two completely different blade types."
1.0,"Thus belt broke three times in the first three months.  The fake leather tears easily and it is very difficult to buckle,.  This belt is an overpriced knock-off of the much better Comfort Click brand."
1.0,The dress was too big. I selected the size according to both size chart and reviews. The seams are very uneven (especially around the waist area). I also purchased the blue one in the same size and it was even larger. Lots of loose threads in buttonholes. Although I love the pattern and style the dress is not at all worth the price. I was really looking forward to enjoying this purchase but unfortunately this was an overall bad buy. I would not reccomend.
1.0,Way smaller than advertised. If you want these order 2 sizes larger of buy better underwear
1.0,Too big and very cheap material
1.0,"Received wrong item size! )Ordered XL, received a Large.) Also, the shirt itself is absolute garbage! The screen printed image on the front is blurry (definitely NOT as pictured!) and just terrible quality overall.<br />Very disappointing."
1.0,"This was to be a gift. However it came with a large hole in the hood. Unfortunat, because the fabric was adorable. Would not buy again. Rann small in size and poor quality control."
1.0,"This material is not what I thought it would be, its very thin and cheaply made. I actually threw it away because I don't think it would have made it through a washing."
1.0,These earrings are so heavy they feel like your ear is ripping
1.0,"didn't like elastic bottom, looked cheap and was really really small. I gave it to my petite 10 year old niece."
1.0,"The Titanium shorts are cotton but what is pictured is a sky powder blue and what arrives is a spruce peacock blue, so that is why I am giving one star and when they update the correct color i will give it 5 stars.<br />Note: The camo and hot pink “Leggings Depot” shorts do not have cotton in them, they are poly and spandex."
1.0,When I got this half the stones were oit of the necklace laying in the box not good
1.0,Has no water proof backing. Very cheaply made. Was very cute though
1.0,"Had a bleach kind of stain on the front when arrived....reordering as I have bought a couple colors and others were fine!  More A lined than shown, tapered towards the bottom.  But a cute, comfortable dress."
1.0,The nose pieces were crooked. So the glasses don’t sit straight and I can’t wear them.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed, its a PURPLE tooth! Its NOT WHITE as advertised, do not buy."
1.0,I ordered this in a 3x.I normaly take a 1x and its still way too small. My daughter normally a large and could barely get it on. I am very displeased.
1.0,"I loved the look of them when I got them, but the first time I picked up my suitcase from baggage claim, it was a crumpled mess. Don't waste your money."
1.0,AHAHA
1.0,Too small...surprising nobody said that in their reviews.
1.0,The fabric was thin and flimsy.
1.0,My daughter tried on as soon as it arrived. It ripped in 2 places. Head piece broke also. Super cheaply made. Was very disappointed. Did not want the hassle of returning it. Bought another one at Wal Mart
1.0,"Ordered size 3xl but it was way too small, this broke my heart, it was a present for my son and it failed to arrive before Christmas and it said “3xl” but actually was probably only a large! I’ll never order from them again!"
1.0,I have purchased many pairs of Hue jeans that fit perfectly.  These did not meet expectations and did not fit properly.  Odd bagging on inside of upper leg.  Will have to wear them with a top long enough to cover flaw.
1.0,Way larger then expect
1.0,Quit running in the first few hours of wearing.
1.0,These don't work.  They have no support.  I can't wear them with anything.
1.0,Don't waste your money. Lost the sun first time that I wore it. Cheap!
1.0,Super cute costume. No stretch. Did not fit in chest area. Purchased a large. Definitely something for a person with a small chest. Great accessories tho. Sadly couldn't zip it all the way up
1.0,I decided to order a small considering that mostly all of the reviews said that it was big ... And we'll lets just say even a small fit me like a bed sheet
1.0,"order 2xl but it was way too large. Cost me $8 to return, not worth it"
1.0,The inside skirt/petticoat/slip is too short. Design is beautiful but the short inner skirt makes it look weird. Also the elastic is too tight and very small.
1.0,Horrible!  Waste of money!!
1.0,I guess it will look great if you are really slim like the model.  I am not overweight and the size small was showing too much.  The medium size would be too big on the upper part.  The quality is not bad but not great either.
1.0,These are so small! Not septum rings at all
1.0,"They would fit a five year old , way too small for and adult . I can't believe it was marketed with a large Santa suit."
1.0,Did not like at all poorly made .
1.0,I really wanted to love these but it just wasn’t working out there awkward fit and not flattering. Plus the material was completely see-through and bad
1.0,I never wore this dress all the stars came off when I washed it 😩 I bought it for the new year and it disappointed me when it came out of the washer.
1.0,"I ordered this dress for my Mother in Hot Pink, XL. I received packaging for my red dress, and hers came in a package labeled &#34;Hot Pink&#34; but the dress was actually a deeper wine red color.<br /><br />I'm giving this poor review in hopes that my exchange is corrected and in 2 days we receive the correct dress as noted, &#34;Hot Pink&#34;.<br /><br />I will provide a better review if all goes well. For now I felt obligated to provide a review of my experience so far.<br /><br />See picture for red dress and &#34;hot pink&#34; dress still in packaging."
1.0,This dress looks like a 14 year olds dress. Too much lace. I returned it without even trying on.problem returning it too. It came back to me from post office!  Beware!
1.0,I was really hoping these would help my night vision. The glare especially off the Halogen headlights is actually painful. All they do is slightly soften the lights from white to a muted yellow. But not enough to make a difference.
1.0,Fits in legs. Actual waist fits but so much material in groin area it looks like there is a baggy diapaer attached to it
1.0,Unstiched. Not what I thought it would be.
1.0,"I am pleased that the headband arrived on time as promised but I am extremely DISPLEASED with how it looked once I put it on. The pictures are very misleading. When the headband is on there are gaps all over, it absolutely DID NOT look full the way it does on the model. Had I known that I would NOT have wasted my money on it. Since I am leaving for my trip it's too late to buy something else that will match my fur coat. I am returning the headband and it's not likely I'll ever purchase from this seller again!!!"
1.0,Did not look like the picture!
1.0,They all came off except for maybe 3 on each shoe
1.0,Adventure Awaits is not in English!  False listing and should be removed.  So disappointed!
1.0,Stopped working in 3 days. Really bad cable.
1.0,"This is way too big for the size described , really bad fabric"
1.0,"Fairly cheap, the handle fell off the second time one was used."
1.0,"A complete waste of money. As the heel area is totally flat, there is nothing to cradle or hold the heel .. your heel just slides around making you walk on various points on the front of the foot to try to compensate. What a poor design."
1.0,THE Quality of item is really low
1.0,Selling gray pants but showing black pants. Also had to pay $5 dollars in shipping to send them back. Stay Away !!!
1.0,has nothing to do with picture. once received it looked cheap and very small
1.0,"Way smaller than small, tiny!"
1.0,This thing is huge. Not useful as a keychain. Regret buying it.
1.0,Fell apart and alsoshrunk
1.0,Material feo pequeño
1.0,Not made for people with small ears
1.0,The shirt came and it was splitting at the seems.  Very disappointed.  I can't return it because I didn't take it out of the package because it was going to be for a present.  There are holes in the side....
1.0,I got damaged product. Earrings are broken.
1.0,Material was cheap! Turned in a week.
1.0,Returned this item. Neckline was way to large and disproportionate. It spanned halfway across my shoulders. Purchased the same blouse from a different manufacturer and it fit great.
1.0,"Gift box came dusty and dirty, necklace was light weight and missing rhinestones. Sending back. Don’t buy. You can do better."
1.0,Thin material and shorter than expected. Not for a tall person.
1.0,Not to buy
1.0,Very cheaply made and shreds extremely easy. It was a cute shirt though. Very disappointed.
1.0,If I could give negative stars I would! Broke within the first few minutes out of the package and fits nothing like the picture! Do not waste your money
1.0,EXTREMELY TINY...!!!<br />The pictures make the ring look big!!<br />In reality this ring is like a little girl's ring.!!!<br />  This ring is a $5 ring TOPS !!!<br />DON'T BUY THIS RING...!!!
1.0,"Personally I don’t like the fabric these are made from , it hold the heat in, unlike cotton"
1.0,Cheap!! A crystal already fell out!! I’m not doing anything out of the ordinary to make the crystal fall out.
1.0,Garment came with a very large hole in it! How disappointed! Don't waste your time.
1.0,"Watch strap broke at the fastening one week after use. Buyer be weary, it isn't so great."
1.0,The item was advertised as XXL it clearly was NOT!  A waste of my money!!!!!!
1.0,All the seems and edges were done with white thread. If it was done in black it would have been better.
1.0,when i went to returned it i was told it was too late . i can not wear it is too small.
1.0,Cute blouse but buy 3 size up..... if the even have it.
1.0,Not true to size.  Runs very small. I bought an XXL  for my 11 year old and it was very small.  She is very slim.
1.0,"Very poor quality materials, run large,  straps constantly stretched. I received these sandals on September 22, by the second week of October, the strap broke. I do not recommend them."
1.0,I was looking for a swim dress that would look good on my body and the bathing suit didn't even have good support or padding for someone with a large chest. Do not get this if you have a big chest.
1.0,Tbe shirt arrived both defective and torn!! This is a complete waste of my money. Never again. So completely mad.
1.0,"Okay for starters, yes 3 leggings for this price was great. But you really get whaty you pay for. They are soooo tight on the waist band and loose on my legs. I constantly have to be pulling them up on my legs and the waist is soooo tight on my stomach. also, after i washed them 1 time, they have little lint balls all over them. Def dont recommend!"
1.0,I ordered a M which is my size and it was too big.
1.0,Bottom was uneven. Top had extra material that showed a large stitch if folded back. Just weird.
1.0,"Runs small, falss at waist, not hip"
1.0,"The uneven stitches are in white thread - not like in original picture which is a darker color thread.  Also, the words and images seem faded."
1.0,"First off, material is see through.  Second, the material is VERY thin and quite cheap.  The fit is too large (not slim as advertised).  It comes very wrinkled and will stay very wrinkled.  Unless you want to iron every time you wear this item (with starch) I would greatly advise you do not purchase.  The fact that this has anything above 2 stars, is beyond me.  Take it from someone who wears business attire 5 days a week - do NOT buy."
1.0,"To small to fit, can’t return them"
1.0,A waste  of time and money.  Weren't all that dark either.  But useless now - busted in the middle and now its all cockeyed.
1.0,The fact that it came in pieces so it's hard to know how it should go together.  So as of now I can't use it at all. Very misleading.
1.0,"This ring looks great online, but once I actually got it I was disappointed. It's SUPER small, thin, and fragile. You can hardly see the stones."
1.0,The hoodie is very lightweight and cheap feeling and the logo on it was just an iron on not the nice ones. Should have went with original products for the price this one was . Very unhappy with the quality.
1.0,I bought the purple one and it is not the same dark purple as the picture. The color of the blouse is closer to a Barney-purple. :/
1.0,These earrings were not what I expected. They looked cheap.
1.0,"I'm 5,5. This is short. More like a tunic. Do not wear as dress unless you want the world to see your naughty bits."
1.0,"Cheeply made.  I bought this for a Christmas gift., It never occurred to me to open it and make sure it worked.  My grandson was thrilled until he opened it and the hands just flop here and there on their own.  I thought it would actually keep time.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Is not black is grey
1.0,Its a very ugly pattern but the fit was nice
1.0,"I got a XXL, I normally wear a large.  The shirt fit like I put on small.  I would recommend sizing up three sizes."
1.0,This watch stopped working after a few days.  It was a total waste of money.
1.0,I like the size but the strap is too small and it isnt even attached.
1.0,Too small.  I went up 3 sizes
1.0,I wish I had gone to the store to purchase a jacket.  Based on customer reviews I ordered a small and received a size xxl. The material is paper thin. NOT happy. I hate having to return items but this jacket it WAY too big!
1.0,I “tested” the case without my watch in it and it was just fine.  Once I put the case on my watch I went to shower. Water was inside the case when I was finished
1.0,This was purchased as a gift.  Ordered it in advance.  Gave it to my daughter and a lot of the features on the watch doesn't work.  Waste of my hard earned money.  It's too late to return. Wish I could get a refund.
1.0,made my septum piercing infected
1.0,I bought this for my mom as a gift at first it was very good for a week or so but then then the chain started to give my mom a rash and bruise around her neck i was debating on whether to get this necklace or another one and ended up picking this one i regret it so much now my mom is in pain. IF I COULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS I WOULD DONT BUY A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!!!
1.0,The fabric is less than quality and very small.<br />I’m pretty sure this is a kids size. I’m normally a small but the large was laughable on me.<br /><br />I did find the same dress with another vendor on amazon and the material was better and normal size. Just double the price but worth it!!
1.0,"This hoodie looks nothing like the picture!<br />It is cheaply put together and I'm assuming a impostor!<br />It looks like polyester! The brown decorations on the breast and around the pockets are HILARIOUSLY sewn on! There is nothing warm about this hoodie, the picture makes the hoodie look fluffy, comfy and warm but what I received is the material of a child's Halloween costume, for $20!!<br />I would rate this negative stars if I could!! Please save yourself the return and don't waste your money!"
1.0,"didn’t know i had to wear shorts underneath, and came almost 2-3 weeks late. i payed $70 for expedited shipping and it still came late."
1.0,Bought this as cute! But than put it on and nope not even close to pic. If you have a size D or bigger don't buy this. Fits bottom as big chested but not around waist.
1.0,Literally fell apart in her hands.
1.0,This t-shirt looks nothing like the picture!!  Buyer beware.  I bought the rose colored one and it doesn't look like pictured.  It is cheaply made and the lettering is in black not white. Listen to the negative reviews.  I didn't and and returning.
1.0,DON'T BUY IT... watch can't keep time properly and slows down within a few hours of winding
1.0,Latch came off after one use. I guess I got what I paid for!
1.0,"Because it is a pain to ship back for me, I have to sew it because it arrived with a hugh tear down the whole side seam. Ugh"
1.0,Arrived late after event planned to use.
1.0,Headband broke
1.0,I only wore a few times and they leopard has already faded off. It's just a white band. Looks terrible. So disappointed
1.0,Complete trash. Broke on first usage...as soon as I clamped it on the bar. Didnt even get to secure the weights on the bar and lift anything.
1.0,"Arrived on Jan 7th. First wore on the 9th, 2 stones fell out (see photo). Only wore a couple times when bent on the 13th (see photo) I sent company a message on Jan 13th asking to replace prior to me leaving a review. No response. So just now today the 27th, after only wearing a hand full of times it broke in half! See photo. I will be returning this item. IF the company replaces it I will update this review."
1.0,"No me dió opción de tallas, cuando recibí el producto era el tamaño para la cabeza de un bebé"
1.0,"If you buy this, don't put in dryer AT ALL. I hung it to dry but popped it in dryer for literally 5 minutes to lessen wrinkles, and it shrunk to an almost unwearable size. Does not look anything like the picture, before or after washing. So buy at your own risk."
1.0,"These are adorable!  But ""both"" arrived with hats broken off the styrofoam base.  Will return and try again"
1.0,Returned this because it won't stay on right.  The band kept flipping.
1.0,"It isn't cotton, not the way American's think, it is gauze and not quality gauze either.  I wear a 16-18 so I bought a 3X just incase, too small and tacky to wear to work or anywhere.  Looks more like a night gown than a dress.  Sending it back."
1.0,"No ear cut outs as advertised. Just a six pack of cheap, thin neck gaiters. Not sure how these people get away with scamming people"
1.0,Muy mala caludad es demaciado delgada la tela no es lo que esperaba
1.0,Does not look like the picture<br />Very strong smell of chemicals
1.0,Metal way too soft.  :(
1.0,"This product is not true to size. I ordered it a couple sizes bigger than I normally would, because I wanted to layer it, and it still was too small even just over a T-shirt."
1.0,"Very weak design, immediately broke within hours of usage"
1.0,The back clip is out of order!
1.0,"There is a horrible odor in these masks--AFTER washing, the odor is still there!!"
1.0,Bought for my daughters wedding and there’s literally nothing holding the top up so it flips down. Don’t bother!!! Waste of money!
1.0,They were great until I washed them the first time and then there were little balls ALLLLLL over them
1.0,Cheap beach cover up or nightgown.  Not well made.  Not attractive.  Just a basic cheap sundress/beach cover up (not sure it is even a dress).  Do not recommend.  Will definitely not ever buy again.  Not worth $23.99 !
1.0,Don't buy it! Junk
1.0,Won't stay on straight.  Got the most expensive ones online. Big mistake.  Buyer's remorse day one.
1.0,Nice dress but the sequins rubbed my skin raw and bust was much too roomy for a large (and that's not a normal problem for these dd).
1.0,"I hate this jacket. Hate it. There is no good way to wear this jacket. Zipped down it looks too big. Y’all, I’m a medium usually, but this jacket is a small and it’s too big. The sleeves are well past my fingertips, and I can actually fit two arms in one sleeve because it’s that loose at the top. Of course, it’s too small when you zip it though; it cinches so tight around the waist it hurts. Unzipped and I look frumpy, zipped and I look like a lampshade struggling to breathe. I don’t own uglier clothes. My husband immediately told me to take it off; he said “please don’t go out with that on”, no my dear, I won’t. Don’t worry. Truly, I don’t want to even donate this jacket, I don’t want some poor old lady picking this up for her granddaughter, thinking she’d look so cute in this bomber jacket and the poor high school girl is like “....thanks grandma....it’s greatttt...” and then tells her friends her grandma got her the frumpiest lampshades with sleeves ever. If you’re going for the worst jacket award, here’s your top choice, but otherwise, I’d save your money."
1.0,The item came apart! Poor construction.
1.0,Shrunk and now is a square shape.
1.0,"The bra is cute, but the quality is very bad. They do fit well, but after only one use it got very stretched out. I’m quite skinny and the size small fit just right. For reference I'm 34C."
1.0,Looked nothing like the image
1.0,"Do not buy! Not water proof. Bought this in November and water got in, it only lasted me 6 months. Waste of money, Amazon won't refund nor replace, called the company for warranty. DO NOT BUY!! False advertisement.."
1.0,"The picture does not look like the dress is stretchy spandex type material but is! Which makes the dress tighter and shorter than intended. If a different, higher quality fabric were used this would be a great garment."
1.0,"Hat is not made well at all , it's a $2 hat that they are selling for $5. it isn't even shaped evenly."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this necklace and wear it but when I got it in the mail the ribbon was torn and the gold looked old and tarnished and just plain tacky. Won't be buying from yall again, sorry!"
1.0,Said it was 100% linen but tag says 45% cotton and 55% linen.  False advertising
1.0,"I bought this watch 8 years ago and loved it, I was just looking to replace it and this was the only seller I found.  When the watch arrived it looked beautiful, just like mine 8 years ago but when I tried to fix the time the winder just came out. I had to take it to a watch repair place to fix the entire winding mechanism. I ended up using the parts from my old watch and the repair was only $7, hardly worth a return.<br /><br />I just wanted to warn all future buyers, I was sold a broken watch."
1.0,Totally see through. Very cheap material
1.0,Cute shirt but wayyyy to small! Ordered xxl and it MIGHT fit a size M. Cute shirt if it fit.
1.0,I follow the measurements and it was too big on me.
1.0,This will only fit a small childs head. I can't do anything with it and it came almost 2 months after I ordered it. I'm very dissapointed.
1.0,"So when you get a dozen of something - I'd think it enough of a sample to establish quality.<br /><br />I ordered xx American active. The tags all say XX Andrew Scott. I noticed when sorting that two tags had a qc sticker. They are the largest shirts in the dozen-BY FOUR INCHES!<br /><br />Im not saying they are intentionally cutting material off the other 10, i will say it looks awfully suspicious the other 10 are all a couple inches shorter.<br /><br />I would never buy either of these brands again. I got two i can actually  wear."
1.0,Product material was like sandpaper.  Material thin and of poor quality.
1.0,"Zipper busted the moment I tried it on. Aged thread... going to a tailor to revise. Low end quality obviously, but with price what do expect."
1.0,"Useless display. Looked like pocket handkerchiefs, but too small!"
1.0,I thought that this product was going to be larger but instead it was something for very young girls
1.0,I’m highly upset about this mask !! It looks nothing like the photos advertised. It has to be tied around your head to stay on. You look out the eyebrows to see. Super disappointing!!
1.0,Mine arrived broken also.
1.0,Very disappointed.  The item was defective when I was trying it. Not what they described and it is heavy. Not worth it
1.0,"Cheaply made, crooked on my face. Reminds me of the cheap sunglasses I used to buy on St. Marks Place in NYC."
1.0,Horrible watch. Loses 5-15 minutes every other day. Cant keep the date correctly also.
1.0,We bought 3 sets of these in different colors. All three broke after just a few uses.
1.0,"Although these are advertised as universal, they do NOT fit Ray-Ban sunglasses. I have a pair of Wayfarers and Justins, and they do not fit either."
1.0,"Wanted to love them. When I received them, the eye of one of the elephants was missing. The backs don't hold well so they are constantly falling out of the."
1.0,Fits well but no support and looks very weird under a shirt.
1.0,Fabric is cheap. Fits oddly. The small size is way too small
1.0,Do not purchase. Very poorly constructed.
1.0,"Do not tumble dry this item, regardless of what the tag reads. It will ruin your shirt and will be much too small for the original person to wear. It lost TWO sizes."
1.0,This has a odd shape and too short. I am 5'7.
1.0,Not happy with it’s fit. Not satisfied at all. It’s a waste of money.
1.0,"Arrived earlier than expected. Don't bother. Was bent and trying for about 20 minutes to put on, it broke.<br />One star is generous."
1.0,I tried hard to love this dress.<br />I’m a size 14 and ordered a large.<br />The material is good but I should’ve ordered an XL
1.0,Lenses are thin flimsy plastic
1.0,Broke within 5 minutes and was not color I ordered
1.0,Very disappointed this was not a denim dress very cheaply made and it was too big.
1.0,"Runs very small.  Material is very clingy.  Close fitting even though that's not portrayed in the photos.  Go up a couple of sizes if you want it to""hang"" on your body.  Color was very bold and ugly in person."
1.0,Negative 1star. 10/40 of the lights will work. Just be careful if a light is dropped it stops working. Those 10 will stop working after a week or so
1.0,Socks lost all elasticity and shape after one wash!
1.0,Beware do not buy this sweater. What they send is a cheap knockoff of the sweater pictured. Would not even give it a one star but it wouldn't allow review to be posted otherwise.
1.0,"Poor quality umbrella.  Very sheer material.  I ordered the tan color and when its open, looks very peach and see thru.  Would not recommend buying."
1.0,"I ordered capris and got full-length leggings.  Too lazy to return, but annoying.  As FULL LEGGINGS they fit fine,  but that’s not that I wanted."
1.0,"This is not what was in the picture! I am going on a trip and this was an important aspect of the experience. Now I have to deal with this headache! Yes, the material is nice but the colors are not true to the picture. This is dark blue and yellow. I thought based on the picture it was black with white lines. I am returning this asap!!!"
1.0,Not worth the money. Feels cheap. The phrase &#34;we're all mad here&#34; says ere all mad here because the design is cut off. Should have been $1
1.0,The letters and bears started ripping off after not even a month use. Not worth the money.
1.0,Boxy and sleeves are too short
1.0,Made way too big and baggy
1.0,Pretty. Color is as pictured. But the gems started falling off the cheap glue within days.
1.0,"Firstly, I ordered a medium and it fit like a large. It was like wearing a circus tent. Second, the material is stretchy as promised, and also very thin and rough. The cuffs are particularly itchy, and I can’t imagine wearing them for a whole day. Also, the “Red” color is very bright, so don’t expect a flattering shade of red. Finally, the sleeves dont “bell” out like in the photo (typical of amazon junk made in China). Don’t waste your time or money."
1.0,I wish the size was correct! Good grief. The men’s size 8 is more like a ten! Way to big and sloppy.
1.0,"it broke as soon as i put it on!!! cheap as hell, dont bother!"
1.0,So fragile!!! It broke easily. The company looks legit but unfortunately my glasses didn’t have good quality.
1.0,Fabric not good.
1.0,"My complaints are many, but the most serious is the injury they caused. I wore these flip flops a mere five minutes and they scraped skin off my toe on my right foot<br /><br />- yes, these fit correctly, they were the right size<br />- no, there were no defects - but the material and design RUBS and irritates quickly<br />- this is not rubber, although title in post states it is 'rubber'<br />- the material reminds me of a child's plastic toy, injection mold junk.. feather light in weight<br />- I own less expensive flip flops bought from local discount stores made WAY better<br />- I bought these to be mold proof. That is probably the one good thing about this product"
1.0,"OH MY GOSH SO SMALL! Measure your waist, add about 4 inches, then buy THAT size."
1.0,"Wore them twice and they broke , screws fell out. Very disappointed in the whole product. Loved the color !"
1.0,Yo necesito el color khaki en el número 12 no es lo que pedí
1.0,"Zipper on the dress was broken in pieces when I openend the package!  I didn't even try it on so I can't report on fit.<br />Please tell me where I can return as there was no return info in the package.<br />  Not able to send a pic as I have no access currently to do so.  I can send back the product if you require if you will let me know where to send.  Please replace product with size large, as I held up the dress to see if it would fit even though the zipper is broken and it appears size medium runs small and there fore a larger size is desired.  Thank you for your consideration and help."
1.0,it broke had it for 1 month
1.0,Quality was good just sizes are small
1.0,One of the crappiest products bought in my 61 years
1.0,I don’t recommend this unless it’s for a one time wear because it is made from cheap material and the shorts faded after one wash and the shirt is a stretchy material that shrunk up to a 12 month old size.
1.0,Its actually orange not red.
1.0,There was no clasp. Not on either side of chain.
1.0,I guess I should have paid attention to the salers name .. Salvageunlimited. The pants definetly seem a bit dirty or as it they've been tried on multiple times.  they also look different on the pic. I haven't tried them on becaus I feel like I need to wash them before trying them on since they look worn. I'm also not gonna bother sending them back since for the price it's not worth having to pay shipping. I'll will wash them and try them and if they don't fit I'll just give them away..
1.0,"Well I ordered this glove to be part of my Halloween costume. I arrived and I could clearly tell it had been opened before.It was re-taped closed. That kind of pissed me off to start. Next the welds are painted brown? It looks terrible. The glove is not properly aligned in with the metal. I have medium sized hands I would say and the leather is snug but not tight; so a good fit. That being said, since it is not mounted far enough into the metal fingers; making the pinky and ring finger are inoperable.<br /><br />If you are buying it merely as a display piece, you may be satisfied. I am not. It being previously opened and the welds really turned me off. I would not recommend this item and am returning it.<br /><br />I have just received the Rubies glove. If you're looking for a functional glove to wear for a costume, that is a much better option."
1.0,"This is metal-coated plastic, and is 16G, not 20G."
1.0,Cut is not a women’s.  Looks like a men’s cut tank and material is polyester type
1.0,"Returned this item as the fabric was totally unexpectedly cheesy, cheap and shiny.  Loved the pattern with the eyes, but this fabric would not breathe during wear, so it had to go."
1.0,Horrible t-shirt!  Poor quality with a stretched neck and faded design.<br />Not as pictured.  Not worth it.
1.0,To large - sizing unclear - expensive return
1.0,product just small/ narrow
1.0,Not heat resistant... heat came straight through the gloves.
1.0,Size 24 was too large for my 22 months old baby.<br />Also i had to pay for shipping to return it.
1.0,"Bad quality material, long before received and can't seem to make a return. Don't buy."
1.0,Earrings were flawed and stems were bent
1.0,"The leggings are very cute, with all the mesh. They are VERY POOR quality.  I wore them TWICE and did NOT put them in the dryer and they already have MULTIPLE holes in the mesh. I'm very dissatisfied."
1.0,Took 6-8 weeks to arrive..missed christmas and quality is crap  I assume came from China.. They did give me refund but was a waste of my time
1.0,This was not what I was expecting....I feel as though if it were a bit bigger it would look decent!
1.0,"looks more like a rag dress,,would not recommend it"
1.0,It's nice just very shoet
1.0,"This Jacket Blazer or whatever you want to call it does not even deserve one star. The quality of this product is beyond poor, it's not as ADVERTISED!<br />1. Jacket is not long as advertised.<br />2. The quality there are no words VERY POOR QUALITY!<br />3. Jacket pocket had a hole in it when it arrived.<br />4. I've decided not to order anything thru a third party it's always a hassle and the quality sucks. It also takes to long to receive.<br />5. Final results i sent back, they sent it back to me and said to keep it, they didn't even want there own product back.  They did not want to give me a full refund. Thanks to AMAZON for steeping in and making sure I got a full refund. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I truly believe this Jacket comes from the Wish site, they just change the names up."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Will not be using it.
1.0,The XXL was barely big enough for my petite assistant.  Quality seemed so so but sizing jsut way way off
1.0,Very low quality. Not to wear for outings.
1.0,Lovely. Broke after worn twice😐
1.0,Item was alot smaller than expected.
1.0,Was not what I expected. Too big didn’t look good did not like patch pockets probably won’t wear. There was no return address
1.0,"Just like everyone else said :( don’t do it; tarnished, rusty and not real."
1.0,"Plastic that broke after only a few wears ... they're cute from afar, but, unfortunately, when you get an up close to look and feel,  they're definitely not worth the price"
1.0,Pretty color but sizing strange.  Way too small.
1.0,Fell apart and took weeks to get here!!
1.0,Not made for big breast
1.0,"I ordered two packs of these bracelets.  Upon opening the box, both packages contained bracelets that were broken with the bracelet pieces dissembled in the bags.  Very disappointing!"
1.0,"The onesie came with a whole, and since Halloween is in two days I won’t even have time to return it and get a new one!"
1.0,"Someone needs to learn how to spell Merry, it not MREEY!!!  Dissapointed. Sewing not so great either."
1.0,"will probably work for a shirt but not at all for a button on shorts. Waste of money, sorry I bought it"
1.0,Bought lrg & xl didn't fit for 36C and size 6 waist tabs were on wrong side to even wear it returned both
1.0,"Online, the dress looks super cute, and in real life it is. However, and this is a big HOWEVER, right as I opened the packaging, there was this terrible stench. The dress smelled like a straight up thrift store. Old and a bit musty. I had to hold my breath even trying it on. Even as I am writing this review, the dress is folded neatly about two feet away from me, ready to be shipped back for return, and I CAN STILL SMELL IT!!! YUCK! Not only that, but the back of the dress is somewhat see-through. You could definitely see the bra lines, which is not so flattering. For the price, it makes sense, though. Very cheap."
1.0,I’m a 44f and I thought that since a 3x fix me a 5x would unfortunately it was three sizes too small like someone took a 3x and put the label 5x on it. The package was good and I’m sure if it had fit it Would have been comfortable.
1.0,Vestido de poca calidad
1.0,"What this does say or show you is the boons have pads in them, making the dress fit funny. Kind of too small, boobs too high. Fits weird. Would not buy another of this brand. I had already washed it so can't return. May attempt to take out pads. There is another brand on here that fits great."
1.0,This keeps falling out my ears.<br />Im never buying anything else from them.
1.0,This was not at all as in the pictures or the description of the ban is not even thick enough to comfortably wrap around the body. Im so upset with this order
1.0,"Initially I was concerned about the negative comments regarding de-magnetizing credit cards, but because there were so many positive comments and only a couple negative comments, I went a head and purchased the wallet.  I'm wishing that I hadn't.  I travel for work, and after 1 week already de-magnetized 2 hotel room keys.  My credits cards have a chip so not sure if they are de-magnetized yet, but not going to push it.  I'm buying a different wallet."
1.0,"Adquiri este producto para mi esposa ,pero al desempacarlo tenia mal olor como a petroleo aceitoso algo asi por lo que descidimos retornarla"
1.0,nothing special. They do not reach the elbow by about 3 inches or so.
1.0,Dislike this shirt. After washing it a few times the picture is destroyed and falling off. Wish I didn’t spend money on this item. Never buy.
1.0,Was not a ponytail hat as described
1.0,Look what I got😩😡
1.0,The fingers on these gloves are so long they looked funny.  I returned them.  Otherwise I wish they fix because they are very nice quality.
1.0,Not long enough in legs
1.0,These ran really small and were super uncomfortable.  They constantly dig into the bridge of my nose and were painful to wear.
1.0,I sent this back. Too small and not worth the money.
1.0,The worst quality ever and the worse support service
1.0,I really don’t like it...the sides which is the silver sticks up and looks stupid!  I haven’t had a chance to send it back yet!
1.0,Item broke as soon as I put it on.  DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,"Received this and was eager to try it on. Way, way too small!! I have a size 7 1/4 hat size and I would estimate this is a 6 or 6 1/2. My wife has been kindly working away at the sewing machine trying to figure out a way to make this fit my modest head by adding expanders.<br /><br />The item itself is OK for the price, but not OK because it seems to have been designed to fit a kid."
1.0,"I am 150 lbs 5”3 . I don’t like tight clothes. I bought this dress, because it looked<br />Super cute and because of<br />The pictures that the ladies posted. The material is the type to stick to your skin, way too snugged around the arms and chest. Meant for super<br />Skinny ladies."
1.0,Very cheap looking almost like a gumball machine ring.
1.0,My grannies broke after wearing it for 5 minutes. One of the little cuffs to hold the bracelet part fell off.
1.0,"I got the gloves in the mail. I put them on and I find out that they arent even gloves! well they are but you cant do anything with them. The quality of the material was so poor I felt ripped off.<br /><br />There were no lines on the top of the hands.<br /><br />The stitching was pretty much falling apart.<br /><br />The gloves dont even go to my wrists, I mean Cmon.<br /><br />I really do feel ripped off."
1.0,Item came defective and no hole in jean for the button to go in. I attempted to make a hole myself and now there is a larger hole. I liked the shorts other than it’s defect.
1.0,The materials were cheaply made.
1.0,Size up folks if runs small
1.0,It broke the first time I used it.
1.0,"Returned this coat, very disappointed. The jacket I ordered looks nothing like the jacket I received. Bright red, not wine. Puffy not fitted."
1.0,These earrings are TINY!!!!  Complete waste if money for me  I loved the design but they are far too small.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"Horrible, they felt like I bought them from the dollar store. Weird textured material, not enough to elastic so there were spots that looked baggy."
1.0,this dress way to large and not very cute on.
1.0,One of the stones was missing before it was even worn.
1.0,"Nice flip flops, love Merrell shoes overall and have many of them, but I have a high arch and the fit on these is way too small, thus causing blisters and cuts on top of foot. Overall very disappointed as I love Merrells, but would never purchase this one again due to the high arch."
1.0,"This tank is obscenely large under the arms, the only way this would fit was if you had gigantic boobs.  It also had a hole in one seam.  Returned."
1.0,It's really really big. It looks silly as a an upper piercing
1.0,Wore it once to dinner and links fell apart. So disappointed.
1.0,TIGHT & SEE THROUGH! If you want to show the world all of your underwear or lack of. On a nice sunny day this dress is for you! You can literally read through the dress.
1.0,Ive been searching for this jumpsuit i found it ordered it and wasn't please sizing is totally off. Fit is bad and i wish i hadnt ordered
1.0,"This dress was really cute but way too small. The XL fit like a medium. Also, the top part of the dress was see through."
1.0,"Not what I expected,  too low cut to cover your rear and too tight c"
1.0,Did not like poor quality. As soon as I open the pack it fell apart. Opal came off unable to put back on earring waste of money. If I could have not given a star I wouldn't couldn't rate it by not given it a star.
1.0,Not worth the $5 not even $1 more like don't sell it. I had to give it a star it wont let me put nothing.
1.0,"The problem was that the things broke before I even put them on. As I unpacked it, one of the buckles on the straps snapped off and I was unable to reattach it. After a while the broken piece disappeared in my wardrobe before I could return it. As usual, I took the loss as part of life (you win some and you lose some) and I ordered another brand. How do you order another buckle?"
1.0,"This fit like a pillowcase. Tried to wash it to make it softer, still stiff as heck. Donated it to the thrift store the second I tried it on again."
1.0,Size runs very large. Had to either pay to ship it back or take a $4 refund.
1.0,"Was very disappointed, the material looks like a  costume material and looked very cheap :(<br />Now I have to pay shipping to return it. Wish I could have just kept it if it was a good peice."
1.0,Sorry.poorly made. Picture looks good. But once it is in your hands..yuck
1.0,If u want to flash everyone ur crotch get this dress
1.0,Poor quality. The lenses scratched very easily making these sunglasses useless
1.0,Too small for my frame
1.0,I do NOT wish to have my name and comment publicly published.
1.0,Item broke when trying to but on.! Never order anything from them again very very cheap made.!
1.0,"I really liked these and was delayed for over a month or more... When I received my order, I was so very disappointed.First of all, the quality is cheap, not one of them I kept! I donated to a homeless shelter. I thought they would be a light sweatshirt, I can't wear heavy shirts as I get very hot. I couldn't tell which was the front or the back! Either way looked like I was wearing drapes!"
1.0,I recieve a empty box!!! I am a Amazon prime member and order often. No headband no necklace!! I want the product or a refund
1.0,Horrible!!! Poor quality.  Doesn’t look like the picture.
1.0,Seems cheap and gets tangled easy WHILE wearing.
1.0,What a shame one washing and on the second wear these socks unraveled I'll stick with the expensive ones for now on.
1.0,"These are not hawthorn  its false advertisement , comes with no logo and cheap cheap material 🙄😭 i wasnt careful enough when ordering brand says heynuts hawthorn!! I own hawthorn and therlse are definitely not !!! And they are not returnable , if you ship them back to China it costs $100+!! Definitely pissed off and amazon is only offering to refund 30% back becausethey'vealreadypaid for shippingonce 🤬!! Wtf these are almost 30 dollars i bought 2!!!🤬🤬😤😤"
1.0,"Product material is incredibly cheap, sent them back"
1.0,The clasp that holds the moon pendant onto the chain broke before first wear. It was meant as a gift to my flower girl and she couldn’t even wear it. Not sure if it’s poor design or we just received a faulty one. We were not rough in any way with it.
1.0,I bought this coat because I was in a bind and needed a coat quickly but the zipper literally broke the first day i received it.
1.0,Broke 1st day I got it. Cheaply made.
1.0,Arrived both damaged had to throw away
1.0,"Description says this should fit shoe sizes up to 12, & I wear size 11 with usually no issues.  I could hardly get these socks on. No stretch what so ever.  Had to essentially break some of the elastic fibers to make them work. Maybe if you are on the smallest end of the size range, these might be acceptable."
1.0,Crap the design is not good at all I will not biy them again thank you suckieee!!!
1.0,"First, not a poly/cotton blend. After rereading product description it says 3 different material types…what? Second, very sheer 100% cotton. Going to shrink even if hand washed and hung dry. Third, used the size chart supplied and yet a bit snug. I wanted to like them, but will be returning."
1.0,"I got these a little earlier than expected, that's the only perk. They're huge and they look like complete s*** in ears because they go out far more than your actual lobe does."
1.0,This item was very dissapointing. The pants were too big and the top was very small and tight. I had to spend a lot on alterations. I did not have time to return but I do not recomend this item to anyone.<br />This was not at all worth the price. I was however very pleased with the color.
1.0,"These are terrible quality.  I tried on 1 from the package and it instantly ripped. They are not designed for adult feet and are very, very thin. Don't waste your time or money."
1.0,pretty but plastic looking and feeling
1.0,Very cheap fabric and fitting is not good.
1.0,"I needed these for an event and did not have time to return/replace them. I needed 30 blue ones so I bought 3 packs of 40. I spent the morning of the event swapping the LEDs out of these into red, green and white finger light cases from another, better quality manufacturer. In this style of device, the LED lead needs to be pressed against the battery to work. But for some reason the case on these is designed with a groove for the lead to lay into, making it less likely that the lead makes the required contact. So half of them don't even work due to an ignorant design feature. Add in that the rubber bands are poor quality and the plastic is rather thin while fully half of them don't work straight out of the dusty gray plastic grab bags that were taped shut in China and you've got a waste of time and money here. These are typical imported total garbage. Try the next higher priced item. That's what I'm about to order right now."
1.0,"This bracelet was so tarnished,  pealing fake silver & too small... definitely returning!"
1.0,Stud is bent. Very tiny.
1.0,Dress is purple and the feathers are blue.
1.0,It should have been an x large I hated it but didn't want to send it back to much trouble.
1.0,Not the color as shown and advertised at all. Immediately returned
1.0,"Looked good, but not worth the trouble, move on and look elsewhere.  Arms fell off before I could enjoy them, used them a handful of times, only to find out today when I needed them for my sunny drive, one of the arms fell off."
1.0,I always wear a size large. This top barely covers my nips! Fits like a small maybe medium if you’re small chested!
1.0,If I could give this 0 stars I would. Does not track movement I wore it for 2 hours and nothing changed.
1.0,"I like wearing oversized t-shirts, so I order XXL even though XL is more my size.<br />The XXL size is tiny. My wife wears S or M usually, and if barely fits her.<br />Even if the size was good, the design is blurry."
1.0,These hurt too badly to wear. The part that goes through your cartilage is just slightly too short. I will never be able to wear them.
1.0,Item came veryh folded up with wrinkles that could not be smoothed
1.0,"Horribly made. I read that it runs small, so I ordered a size down. The waistband was the only thing that was small--and it was very small. Once I had gotten the thing on, everything but the waistband was huge. Then, I couldn't get it off because the waistband wouldn't stretch. I ended up ripping it. I was very sad this was so cheaply made. I wanted to wear it to my graduation. I'd rather pay more for something that would work than pay little for a cheap dress that will rip anyways. I don't recommend this at all."
1.0,"This shorts come way too oversized, I ordered mine XL, since I use XL shorts usually, but this one's were jumbo XL, they are way too big, I use them as pijamas now, they are too baggy for me to go to the gym with them, I was thinking on ordering an smaller size, but they aren't cheap so I don't feel like experimenting with sizes and wasting money and time. But I think they are like 2 sizes over the one I use, they are pretty elastic, so if you order 2 or 1 size less than you use, it wi still fit and you won't feel like they will teat if they fit a bit tight.<br />I am a tall guy, and I'm kind of big, not fat but not fit, in between, I had a friend who's way thicker than me to try them so I could see if I could give them away, and they still looked way too big on him."
1.0,The title says these are joggers. They are absolutely NOT joggers. They are straight-legged and have no taper. Do not buy these if you want joggers.<br /><br />They had a heavy chemical smell when they arrived.<br /><br />The other reviews about sizing are correct. These run a little small. I ordered a large (I'm usually a medium) and the waist fits fine.<br /><br />The build quality seems fine for cheap fleece pants but the descriptions and sizing are not accurate.
1.0,Way too small even for a small adult. Should be labeled for children.
1.0,I ordered this romper in navy blue/small. I am 5’3” 125lb 34-26-35. When I took it out of the plastic bag I noticed it was a soft material but also that the button was barely hanging on and there was like a “nest like” bunch of thread at the bottom of the left leg.  I still put it on because I can see the button and cut off the nest but the look of the item itself was atrocious! I immediately folded it nicely and went straight to my amazon account to request a refund! I can’t wait to get my money back into my amazon account lol!
1.0,This sweater is cheaply made and strange proportions.  The top overlays are too small and cross the chest area badly.  I'm sending it back.
1.0,I dislike because they wasn't individually wrapped.
1.0,Picture is misleading! There is no leather. It’s all over the same material as the upper part.
1.0,"Band around the ribcage is way too small and not very stretchy. The sizing chart is no help. Unless you are as thin as the models in the photos, this is not likely to work."
1.0,"The necklace looks much cheaper than in the photo, it looks like something that came out of the $1.00 store"
1.0,"Receive it today, tried it on and it ripped right through the back."
1.0,"Poor fit and poor quality, at least for my size 38D.  There is no elasticity in the material and the cup size and shape are inadequate compared to virtually any other sports bra I have bought in the past...I guess the low price should have been a warning.  I'm not bothering to return because I removed the tags, but definitely not  ordering or recommending this bra."
1.0,Runs very small...didnt fit at all
1.0,"This is a very very light ring. Like, its weight is so negligible, I can barely feel it in my hand.<br /><br />If that doesn't tell you something, then let me tell you: this ring is NOT Damascus steel. Period. It is, at best, a zinc-coated brass ring with striations and cuts in it to facsimile Damascus. So, yes, cheap ring is cheap, but false advertising is lying and theft.<br /><br />Stay away!"
1.0,Brand new and one is missing a blue jewel. Bought 2 for daith piercings. Not worth the money
1.0,"They are cutting off the blood circulation, they are so tight."
1.0,Bottoms too big and top too small.
1.0,"Had such high hopes for this. The material is like a napkin, the fit is atrocious. Not flattering at all. Zero stretch."
1.0,"Don't  hold up, zippers broke."
1.0,"Cheap, Thin, not worth the money. It takes over a month to receive a t-shirt because it is coming from China."
1.0,The sunglasses was crooked
1.0,When I got them I absolutely love them. After wearing them a couple of times they fall apart. Wasn't expecting that.
1.0,The product is not like it looks
1.0,Horrible quality. Didn’t last a month with out a tear. All but two belt loops broke. Stitching came undone.
1.0,The caps came apart at the seams while trying on. Seller contacted me and asked for pictures but never did anything after receiving the pictures. I waited to post my review hoping the seller would replace or refund but they did neither. The doo rag is working well so far. I would not purchase again.
1.0,Does not fit my wife's face.<br />Did not help Shen chopping onions
1.0,These don’t work are horrible. I had bought some from PulseTV and they were great these look the same but just don’t work AT ALL
1.0,I’m allergic to all kinds of metals the ONLY 2 my skin tolerates are gold and stainless steel. I bought this earrings because the description said “stainless steel” and the next day I started wearing them one of my ears got infected… 2 weeks later and I still can’t wear any earrings because of my ear hasn’t healed yet of how bad it got infected. So if you are also HIGHLY ALLERGIC certain metals PLEASE DON’T BUY THIS EARRINGS because they are NOT stainless steel 😡
1.0,It shows full sleeve but is only actually 3/4 length
1.0,"terrible - buyer beware!! do not buy from this company! the worst customer service I have ever experienced, and these earrings will not last long... DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM DAZZLING ROCK - trust me, best decision you'll ever make"
1.0,Didn’t fit the watch.
1.0,Is way too big is looks more like a ankle bracelet
1.0,"Ugliest top. Really cheap, material , and looks nothing like the photo. Won't even give to Salvation Amy. I'd be embarrassed. NEVER AGAIN purchasing anything that comes from China."
1.0,These sneakers lasted my Kindergartener only 2 months. Sneakers basically fell apart after a short time. Not happy with the product.
1.0,"it's different from the picture. the picture shows it has a ring for the foot. But it doesn't! just a hole in the bottom.<br />however the texture is good, so thick so warm."
1.0,"It looked great just out of the package, but I washed it before wearing it and it was awful after washing. I had to throw it out."
1.0,"Cannot get to connect to home systems to use. Love the idea for Labeling pantry, but can get.it to connect, so sytems works. Instructions DONT MAKE SENSE."
1.0,Cheaply made falls apart right out of oackage
1.0,Too Small and have. bump on the heal making it very uncomfortable.
1.0,This is my SECOND item return...i specifically ordered an XXL and it STILL didnt even go over my head..I normally wear a large or XL so i assumed the XXL would be perfect...wrong..this is far from a standard XXL...not happy at all!!
1.0,Watch the description on this product! It’s marked slim in the color not in the fit!! They are definitely slim fit which is fine if that’s what you’re looking for!!
1.0,"The stock photo with the earrings on the ear is very deceiving. It looks cute and delicate with the octopus facing 90 degrees away from the face. In reality it is large and clunky, it doesn't fit snuggly so it droops, the octopus is facing 180 degrees from face (backwards on ear), and I can't possibly imagine who decided it would look good to have the brass plated with the silver, but it looks much worse in person than in the photo, probably because you can't see how large the silver balls are. Very disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,They were whatever
1.0,"I waited weeks for this ring to arrive, when I opened it I thought it was beautiful and worth the wait. I have only been wearing this ring for an hour and one of the stones has already falling out of it. Now I'm disappointed that I wasted money on such cheap junk!"
1.0,I'm not sure what that stuff is made out of but it's definitely not a natural fabric. If you planned on using it in the spring or summer also plan on sweating your butt off because the fabric doesn't breathe. I'm really disappointed because it would have been a nice skirt otherwise. The tag doesn't even say what the fabric is or what it is made out of... I'll definitely be returning it.
1.0,"The quality of the bag was not that great.  I took it out of the box and hung it on the back of my door.  I looked at the bag a few days later and it had weird blue/black marks on the bag (if I didn't know any better, I would say it looks like mold).  Plus, the name of the bag is wearing off already, and again, I never used the bag."
1.0,Not for big chested women. I read the reviews and tried the tricks to help make this product work. It simply doesn't unless maybe you are a super petite woman and no more than a B cup.
1.0,BROKE FIRST DAY WILL RETURN
1.0,"The ankle holes are very wide and the fabric is a little stiff, returned them immediately. Love code fit, just not this style of leggings"
1.0,The adapters would not lock into place in the watch. Poorly made!
1.0,Looks like the shirt graphics was partially completed. The white  is MISSING. It looks like the the outline was completed and yellow filled in.<br />Sending back and requesting a REFUND IN FULL.
1.0,Horribly small. My size is 10 to 12. Ordered an XL. The sleeves fit but nothing else. I may as well have ordered a size 2.
1.0,The torso is very narrow and I am 5'7 but since I usually wear S/M I purchased the M and it fit everywhere EXCEPT the torso. So disappointed.
1.0,"I didn't even try this on.  The button holes on the front were not finished properly, so there was no way to close the buttons.  Returned."
1.0,"Im tall.<br />Fits small, is low rise, got it scratch the first time did wear it."
1.0,Waaay too big for my head. Their “pink” is a salmon or peach. NOT LIGHT PINK. See photo
1.0,Before I even wore this dress - the elastic came out of the sleeve- your clothing must be coming from China- it has become very poor quality
1.0,"Not Even the same Dress. Material is different. The Blue is darker, I specifically picked it out because of its style,  but its way different<br />I got ripped off,  never again!"
1.0,Had to send back as received no shoulder strap.
1.0,Did not fit well at all. Fabric was not great quality and was not soft but kind of scratchy. Bummer. It is cute.
1.0,This was very small. I had to cut into the hat in order to make it fit. Order a size or two bigger than what you wear for a New Era hat.
1.0,Ordered a 4 pack and only got 2.
1.0,"Cheap fabric, no shape and does not even fit my 11 year old daughters head."
1.0,The Shades was bend and scratched up. I'm so disappointed.
1.0,"Ya, I thought it would be cute! I returned it!!! The color was the only cute thing about it well and the saying…"
1.0,"Collar is scratchy and materials are thin and tear easily without barely being touched on very first time wearing. Size runs much smaller than the normal sizing charts. Very, very cheaply made. Would not recommend even to my worst enemy. Can't return due to tearing and then the company has the nerve to charge shipping charges for this piece of junk. First time I have ever bought something from Amazon that was a true ripoff!!"
1.0,Too small and too short for a medium I’m normally a small but bc of the material I bought what I thought was a size up ... it fits like a extra small and short at that my belly almost shows
1.0,worthless. extremely small and I even ordered a size up. cheap material and the bottoms have no stretch/give.
1.0,This thing broke 3 days after I got it so will not be buying again
1.0,"Not at all the color that is pictured it's more of a green, horrible color!"
1.0,"Definitely not size correctly, i’m so disappointed and I can’t even return it to Amazon because it’s shipped from China. 🤦🏻‍♀️"
1.0,Really bummed when I got these leggings!! They had a huge rip in the crotch area and are totally unwearable!!!
1.0,Way to short I am 5'11&#34; and it does not cover rear end.
1.0,Very long. Needed to be tacked in numerous places - ended Up  returning this item
1.0,Do not buy. Way to small. I order a XXL and that's what the tag says but looks like mayb a large
1.0,Very small not thick at all I will never buy again
1.0,Too expensive to return!
1.0,I bought this item for my husband's birthday. He left them on to shower and the front separated from the post! Was a waste of my money and time.
1.0,cannot set time  gave it to salvation army
1.0,"I got a L, which usually tends to fit me. This bathing suit was so small. The top is maybe 2 inches of fabric so if you have any boobs at all good luck. The bottom fits but is tight at the waist band. If I could give 0 stars I would"
1.0,"Cap is fine although the bill is cockeyed. Soaking it and doing the can trick doesn’t help. Made in Bangladesh, so…<br />Also, the embroidery is off center which makes it look worse. Not worth the $24.99."
1.0,The box the band came in had puncture holes and the band itself was not well made. Part of the edge on one side was extremely sharp where it wasn’t woven together well. It was like sharp needles on the edge. It also came with a scuff/Knick in the part that connects to the fitbit tracker. Will be returning.
1.0,Horrible. Cheap and uncomfortable
1.0,Way too small and very short waisted
1.0,"Broke instantly ! It looks beautiful and it has a cute little gold bell at the end , but it didn't last a day . Weak material :/"
1.0,It is just to flimsy.  I didn't expect much and it didn't exceed my very limited expectations.
1.0,Does not fit correctly.  No way to properly size.  No size chart.  Don’t bother.
1.0,Hair shedding
1.0,The cheapest quality product i have ever purchased i had to give 1 star to post this or it would be less
1.0,"My cousin was so excited when she bought the dress, but when it came she was really disappointed. The dress is really big even though she took the right measurements. The beading doesn't look as beautiful as the picture showed, and it had a big tear in it."
1.0,"wear large, got XL and just hangs to much! color blue was pretty. gave it to charity."
1.0,"I ordered this because I really wanted a denim trench coat. When I think of a trench coat, I think of a coat that at least hits my knees. The photo on the left is the photo they display as the trench coat. The photo on the right is what they sent me. This is something that could not cover my hips. Their sizes do not make sense for American bodies."
1.0,Crap material. Picture isn't reality.
1.0,This shirt fits my daughter great she luvs it big fan of milly bobby brown . the buttons on this shirt just keeps popping off and tring to find a replace these buttons its not easy to find the exact button
1.0,"Before I purchase, I always check reviews and photos.<br />At the time they were none available to review? I guess it was an app issue.<br />The pendant is not worth $2 let alone $17. It’s so tiny!!!!!"
1.0,I purchased this wallet in April 2015 and already the credit card slots are torn.  The plastic disintegrated and is useless.  Very disappointed.
1.0,This clasp to hang on chain broke within one wearing. I will have to pay a jeweler to repair with a more durable slide. Thank goodness I didn’t lose the gold coin in it.
1.0,"The fabric was very slick, almost like a shower curtain. Didn’t fall nicely at all."
1.0,Bought this hoodie for my son. It looks like a tie-dyed version of the beach photo. Sloppy and NOTHING like the hoodie I expected to receive.
1.0,Glass was smudged obscuring lettering - had to return product.
1.0,It doesn’t close enough
1.0,Strange fit and fabric feel.  Cute really small.
1.0,These earrings fell apart within 30 days of receiving them.  Not happy with length of time it took for this item to fall apart
1.0,"Some aren’t the correct size, and the<br />Gems fell out."
1.0,I've ordered a lot of these.  In the last few years the quality has dropped to the point I'll be looking for a replacement next time around.
1.0,If you have a fat foot then go for it. The straps were too lose and even the color seemed dull not as pictured .. I have light skin and it made my foot look pale… hope that makes sense lol
1.0,"It he strap keeps on falling off purse, and it end up on the floor..  Don't feel comfortable with my gun in this purse.  They should do something with that strap.  Otherwise it was ok, but felt heavy for me..  I am only 5'1"
1.0,Way too small made at children’s sizes.
1.0,The lens is loose in the frame and the glasses are already bent coming out of the package.
1.0,Not sweater like material you would expect. The shrink wrap packaging created bad wrinkles in the already odd material which already felt like cotton candy.
1.0,poor products
1.0,"I have purchased a few ties from HiTie. They were OK..This one sounded like it had tissue paper on the inside bottom....so I peeled back the fabric, and it was CLEAR PLASTIC TAPE holding it together. The workmanship was poor to say the least. They were too lazy to just cut a new fabric lining, and instead chose to tape on a new piece. Good grief! I have never seen anything like that one! Returning the item. I really have doubts that this is 100% silk. Silk has a feel and drape to it, and also has a slight earthy smell when steamed..This does not reflect that at all. I think this is just a cheap poly. I can't prove that. Stiff fabric, not soft, but beautiful vibrant color."
1.0,"It was too small,  returned it immediately"
1.0,Esta 2 tallas por debajo de lo normal. Uso L y la XL me quedo demasiado ajustado que lo tuve que regalar.
1.0,Definitely not authentic
1.0,"I normally wear a medium or large, ordered the large. It fit like a small, returned it. Other than the sizing, the print and material were nice."
1.0,This is nothing like the picture. The material is horrible and extremely cheap and tacky.
1.0,"This one has a seam on the top. It’s not what I expected. All the other Richardson 112’s I have, have a seam that lays flat and goes all the way down the front. Other than that it seems like a nice hat."
1.0,I lookes up the watch I needed a band for this came up.  Didn't fit at all.
1.0,I got these slippers yesterday and immediately when I put them on the tail of the bunny slippers fell off. Today the pink bows fell off. They were held on by super glue. Very poorly made. So disappointing because they are super cute but they are completely falling apart! I'm surprised at all of the good reviews on here.
1.0,"Sparks are great - but this flimsy little piece of Made in China garbage is TOO DAMN SHORT to reach under the grate to the source of flame. Instead, when gas is on the grill the spark ignites it from inches away so you get a full blast of flame - singed my arm hairs two days in a row! It's so tiny and feels like it will break at any minute. Virtually useless. Should have just bought a refillable Bic. Get screwed every time I try a ""new"" product on Amazon."
1.0,Stones are not glued in there right. Can’t wear like that
1.0,I would not buy them not true to size
1.0,These are child-sized tights. Should be advertised as such.
1.0,"The size and material are great, and maybe I just happened to get a defective one, but the string for the strap broke the day after it arrived."
1.0,I don’t know why they are saying “lovers red” because these are NEON ORANGE like a traffic cone! Ughhh.... requesting a refund.
1.0,Broken wouldn’t even fit in my Apple Watch to lock
1.0,This product is stupid. The material isn’t flexible enough to fit around any pair of glasses or sunglasses I own and honestly I don’t see how it would even work on the most standard eye glass design.  The material is folded over length wise on the ends then blind stitched to make the hole for the ear resting part of the glasses to fit in but the resulting hole is sooooo small it’s absoulely useless.  Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Wore once and they literally fell apart. Tossed. Money wasted. Avoid.
1.0,"Not impressed especially as these weren't cheap! Very thin fabric but more importantly, one leg is at least 3 inches shorter than the other! Will be sending back for a refund!"
1.0,I had the original sunglasses for years and replaced the lenses due to scratching.  Within a few months the lenses started to delaminate all around the edges and clouded the lense.
1.0,It fell apart in two days. Not good quality
1.0,Ordered these last year and they were 2 sizes too big
1.0,I thought I would like them and that they would be baggy at the ankle and they were tapered so not the fit I was looking for! Material was nice the style wasn't for me.
1.0,"I usually wear a 1x in American size, ordered a 3x and it was so small that I couldn't get it past my hips. It has little to no stretch, you would have to size up by like 4 sizes"
1.0,"Terrible quality holes form in toes in days, waste of money"
1.0,Too tight...
1.0,"POOR Quality or lack of it is more accurate. The lenses in both of the loops are very loosened..<br />I don't know where the high ratings on this product are coming from but it makes me suspect that people affiliated with the mfr and/or seller have posted misleading or exaggerated overly positive reviews.<br />The loops I received are closer to cheap, poorly made JUNK than to loops that an actual jeweler or serious hobby enthusiast or power hobbyist would knowingly purchase and use on a regular basis."
1.0,"Looks dirty no matter how careful you are. Doesn't come clean easily, or at all. Almost immediately it starts looking dingy."
1.0,Band is to small
1.0,"Thin, material feels like your draped in a sheet. Fits like an awning and is poorly cut. I returned it and was never credited by seller or by Amazon!!!!!"
1.0,"I was very disappointed with this entire process and the product. The sweat shirt was 5 days late, so I couldn't even wear it on Valentine’s day. It is also nowhere close to being a sweatshirt. It’s thin and shiny! The sleeves are copper and not red!"
1.0,"Uncomfortable, I usually wear a 9 but went up half a size and it still did not fit correctly."
1.0,Decided i did not want a Kardashian ass.  Returned and recommend if YOU want that as your prime portfolio on outstanding features you get this.  When no one can remember your face---you will get it.
1.0,Returned this blouse. Does not look as displayed at all.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Ordered a 2XL which should be a little big on me. This 2XL was way too small. Pulled it tight in the stomach and still had a 3” gap. Either labeled wrong or not U.S. sizes.
1.0,I wear Birkenstock all the time--sandals and shoes but these boots were really terrible. Too big and very stiff. i can't imagine who could wear them.
1.0,The earrings came completely tarnished. What a waste of my time to return these. This company should not be allowed to sell their products through Amazon. Trash.
1.0,The screen printing on the back of the jersey is smaller and of a different color than the advertised picture.
1.0,Mask has perforations that allow particles in. Some of the masks had breaks in seams.
1.0,Extremely dissapointed in this product. Never able to wear after I washed it.Too blousy and cheap looking
1.0,"Very uncomfortable.  The material makes you feel hot, there is a rough seam that comes over chest area (see picture), and runs very small. I ordered a size larger than I wear and should have ordered 2 sizes larger.  Not happy."
1.0,Looks nothing like what's displayed
1.0,Bracelet broke within days of having it.
1.0,These are horrible. I am post reduction and know my exact size. These are way too small. They offered no support and didn't cover my chest. I will stay with my sports bras. I just wanted to attempt to try a regular bra. No thank you.
1.0,Fit was a big problem
1.0,Literally every time I put this on a new hole appears.  Cheap made returned
1.0,The lens came out the second time I used them. It won't fit back in. Not only that but they SMELL horrible.
1.0,Low quality black front of mask but with white trimming
1.0,Arrived vacuum bag packed for some inexplicable space saving reason.  If there was ever any puff to the flimsy dacron in this jacket it was suffocated out in packing.  What you get is an extremely wrinkled thin skinned rayon pancake that in no way presents like the product in the photo.  Damn skimpy--made more like a Halloween costume than a jacket.
1.0,Much too long to be useful.
1.0,All the stars and moons fell off in the first 5min
1.0,These masks have a bad smell and they were shipped from Hubei Province which is in Wuhan.  The box did not match the product inside. Sending back and would not recommend.
1.0,"I could see the horse on the computer screen, but not once I got them.  No one will ever know that there's a horse there.  Not worth the money."
1.0,"Do not waste your money! Seams at neck don't match up. Odd sizing, huge top, skinny at waist and I am a size 4. Terrible quality."
1.0,"Low quality leather and construction.  I didn't expect this to be as nice as my original Alicia Klein nappa leather taxi wallet, but this wasn't even worth the low price point. First, it's shorter (length-wise after opening) than the original. Second, it was cut so badly that the shape wasn't symmetrical in the rounded corners. Third, poor stitching.  Returned."
1.0,"The dress is aqua blue on amazon, but when you get it, it's a real blue. So basically, both of the dresses with this same pattern are the same color."
1.0,The straps are small for kids and scratches easily
1.0,The dress did not come below my breast with out rising up
1.0,"I was so excited to get these pants. I tried them on and they looked great. I wore them the next day and got several compliments. Then after just a couple of wearings I noticed that the elastic bands in the fabric were starting to break along the seams. They were very visible, especially in the seam along the butt.  I could not wear them. So, I bought another pair hoping that it was just that first pair that I had. I've worn the new pair one time and the same thing is happening. With this pair, the threading along the seam is already pulling apart.  I'm so disappointed because the pants are comfortable and do really look nice. But they are obviously cheaply made."
1.0,Shirt it self is good quality which is good as after one washing nearly the entire image has fallen off of it. I followed the washing instructions and they were of no help in maintains the image.
1.0,Cheap materials not worth the price
1.0,"I was disappointed in this beanie. The problem pompom is attached with a safety pin and hard to remove. The beanie itself is small and barely fits on your head and I have a small head, so it is very uncomfortable."
1.0,Cool pattern and soft... but the fabric is so thin you can see the prints on the other side. Would not recommend.
1.0,This is huge. When i bought it  showed it was one size fits all. But when I received i saw the tag says  XL.
1.0,Not what it seems to be.
1.0,This fabric is absolutely horrible. It’s cheap and feels like a Halloween costume quality. I have other dresses in this exact style from another seller that has far better quality fabric. That’s what I get for trying to save a few bucks...wasted money!
1.0,"As others mentioned, there seems to be a manufacturing flaw.  The seam next to the fly is not sewn together very tightly and rips quite easily.  This seam in one pair ripped entirely on my first wear.  The seam on another pair ripped on the second wear.  I'm expecting that this will happen on the other two pairs.  Pay a few dollars extra and get underwear that won't disintegrate on a couple wears.<br /><br />Seam flaw aside, they do look and feel nice."
1.0,Ripped in first wear.
1.0,They will ripped if you bend over. Not gonna risk it
1.0,These run really small.
1.0,"This ring is HORRIBLE. I bought this after reading the reviews in hopes that they were true. Well they're not. This ring absolutely sucks. After a week of wearing it, it started turning my finger green. GROSS!!!! Never buying anything from this company again and you shouldn't either!!!"
1.0,"terrible, flimsy, cheap material. unflattering fit."
1.0,Tela diferente y fea
1.0,I ordered 2sizes to big to make sure it would fit and it was still way to small!
1.0,Couldn’t read the first few words
1.0,It fit my head (barely) and flattened my hair so bad. Definitely returning!
1.0,not USA SIZES
1.0,One hoop broke off and they all turned colors after 1 use. I got my money back. These are super cheap. Better stuff from the dollar store.
1.0,I was sadly disappointed  when I opened this package to see how smashed the purse was in the mailing envelope and how cheaply made it was. The straps are frayed as if someone had worn it for years. It was so cute in the photo. Very sad
1.0,I’m normally a medium. This thing fit like a big curtain and has no shape to it at all.  Very disappointing.
1.0,This is a cute cardigan but when I got to work wearing it I realized that it had a giant hole in the sleeve!
1.0,broken within just a few months of use.  You get what you paid for.
1.0,cheaply made. Was not at all what I expected.
1.0,"Shirt is poor quality. The logo printed on the front is off center & is already fading/coming off. If you choose to order this shirt, you might want to order a size or 2 larger. After washing this shirt it shrank significantly!"
1.0,Absolutely HORRIBLE cheap construction.... do NOT waste your money!!
1.0,Fingers still cold
1.0,Poor design and fabric
1.0,Literally not going to even fit an adult face.
1.0,Came neatly packaged in plastic sleeve inside a hard case. Horribly scuffed and scratched lens. Figured it was a random mistake so ordered 2nd pair. Arrived neatly packaged again but lens worse than 1st pair. Started a return but more trouble than it was worth so now out $14 (2 @ $7 each). Thanks Amazon!
1.0,Ordered for special summer event. Sized up x2. Couldn't even get it over my head and shoulders.  Cheaply made.
1.0,"I would rate this at zero stars if the system allowed.  Quality is zero -- the track pieces don't fit well together.  The track supports are mismatched to support the track, which makes the misalignment worse.  Finally, the slot cars don't stay in the slot.  Let me say that again... the SLOT cars don't stay in the SLOT, causing them to fly off the tracks on every lap.  For seven and nine year old boys, this is not good.  For a parent, it's very frustrating.  All said, this set isn't worth the time or any amount of money.  As with all things by the Carrera brand, this item is high on price and low on quality.  Avoid it like the plague."
1.0,"This item looks like it only costs $1 to make. It's literally three pieces of thin fabric sewn together. Like I can make this. On top of that, it's tiny. I'm petite as is (5ft, 96 lbs) and it barely fits me. It's so bad"
1.0,This is Not a nice Blouse you can wear out for dinner or a date. It looks and feels like a pajama top or the top piece to a set of Long John's. The Neck line is definitely Not Designed for it to hang off the shoulder. The advertising photo is certainly misleading. I am so disappointed.
1.0,They are incredibly large. I read reviews and almost all of them said order up. Wish I hadn't... That was NOT the case for me. They're going back.
1.0,"I have ordered several from this company, but this one came and I could barely read it and now nothing is left.  It was not well etched"
1.0,This was so awful start to finish. It is scratchy because the entire thing is made out of loop Velcro closure so nothing is soft on your skin. The connecting pieces to the fitbit are cheap plastic prone to snapping and the closure I had to use pliers to get it back off of my Fitbit. I was so worried I was going to end up breaking my Fitbit trying to disconnect this trash from it.
1.0,Fabric very cheap looks lot different then the advertisement
1.0,"The product ripped the first time it was put on, the side of the dress ripped right off and you could see right through it. DO NOT BUY"
1.0,"Very poor quality not worth 1.00. The finish looks like something was stuck to it and pulled off on one earring. Too bad, it was a cute design..."
1.0,This peice completely fell apart in the dryer. The heat was too much for the material.
1.0,Fell apart the first time my daughter wore it. I ruined her new dress by pulling on it. She fixed it and wore it again and then it ruined her new shirt.
1.0,"I'm giving this irem one star because I wore it once, took it off, and was zipping back up and the zipper broke. Other than this issue,  I like the jumpsuit and the fit, but the quality is not good if the zipper is broken already and I was planning to buy more :("
1.0,The sizing on this garment is completely off
1.0,Unfortunately I did find a good use for this item as it came with missing straps.
1.0,The velco on this ban does not stick together.  I have to put a stafety pin in it.  The velcor that holds the actual Fitbit is stupid and very hard to get my Fitbit in and out of the little pocket on the ankle band.
1.0,The bandana is pretty but if using the ear loops it is too tight.  Also  the material is not breathable and lots of moisture builds us. In the winter this will cause chapped skin
1.0,Absolutely awful quality . All of them but the tie one  broke within seconds . Like litterally broke when I took them out of their individual packaging . Such a waste of money . Beyond disappointed .
1.0,Nice Bracelet but only received one of the set of two.
1.0,not strong enough... bends when you put on your shoes.
1.0,"I ordered the extra large and I would say that it would fit about a nine-year-old. I am a perfect large five foot six, 135 lb and usually wear a 10 or 12 in clothing. These fit my nine-year-old daughter who is a girls 10 to 12"
1.0,cheaply made.  Turned my wrist green the first day I wore it!
1.0,App no longer exists. Do not buy.
1.0,fell apart in 3 days.
1.0,Not as cute in person as in the picture.  They look a bit cheap.
1.0,"My kid immediately broke one of the legs after getting it out the packaging, very flimsy"
1.0,"Son cómodos, buena elasticidad, el problema es que se deslizan de las patas de los lentes."
1.0,"Nice slippers, but too small.  Sent back with no problem and was refunded immediately!"
1.0,The first set I bought was in unacceptable condition in that one pair was not assembled. They were cute so I accepted an exchange. Upon opening the box 2 Pair were not assembled!!! I did not order nor want a DIY EARRING kit.
1.0,The beads I received look nothing like the picture. Very disappointed. But they were only a penny each.Guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"Had to change my review since after 6 months, this item was no longer able to be polished and the stones look gross, foggy, dull, and just a total waste of money!"
1.0,I order a x large an it was a small.  It fix my daughter that wears a small an I wear a large to a extra large I couldn’t get my arm in the coat an the Sleeve in the coat was twisted
1.0,I ordered dark olive- it’s a poopy brown color and so ugly. I do have these in black and love the fit (they run 1-2 sizes small).
1.0,these  sun shields are to big for a petite woman.. with smaller glass frames...
1.0,Too big and too loose and not of the same quality before placing the order
1.0,Not at all what the picture showed!!
1.0,The key ring is flimsy. It fell apart.
1.0,"Poor quality, cheap and cheesy."
1.0,This broke within minutes of me wearing it and I didn’t notice until it was already gone so I can’t even return it or ask for a refund.
1.0,This watch band is definitely not a real red.  This is also hard to get off of the watch itself.
1.0,"Cheap favric, I sent it back. It’s junk and not cute at all."
1.0,"Normally a size 16 and ordered an XL. Very small, about 3 inches too short (and I'm only 5'4&#34;) and extremely poor quality fabric. Very disappointed."
1.0,"These slippers were a gift for my husband and he loved them when he first received them.  However, in less than 1 month they started falling apart at the seams.  One shoe has completely separated from the sole.  I don't typically leave negative feedback but wanted others to be aware that these shoes are WORTHLESS.  Please don't buy, as you will be as disappointed as we are.  Very unfortunate because they appear to be really nice slippers."
1.0,They broke the first time I used them😞
1.0,Very difficult to make them actually stay on your teeth. Ended up just not using them for this reason. Waste of my time & money.
1.0,This item is listed as 95% cotton and 5% spandex. I thought it would be perfect. It arrived as 100% polyester. No thank you. How fast can I return this POS?
1.0,Fabric feels terrible and cheap. You can see right through it and it smells awful. Wish I could send it back but I came from China and it’s not worth the trouble.
1.0,Super Upset..... Super Small FIT Must Order 3 SIZES BIGGER THEN YOUR ORIGINAL SIZE
1.0,"The watch kept losing time. I finally gave up and threw it away. I reset it once and it worked for a while but noticed this morning it had lost 10 minutes.  Also, the second hand looks too much like the minute hand."
1.0,"First of all the color wasnt at all like the picture, that was the first issue. I got it for thr color and style and it ws not no where near off the shoulder as advertised either! It was a  crew  neck. The shorts were huuuuge and looong. Also it is a cotton and poly blend, not spandex loke advertised, but only 15 percent cotton so it did not shrink either. So all 3 big things were not as advertised. Color, fit or material. I was gonna keep if it would at least shrink for comfy big pjs but not worthit since it did notshrink and dont even loke the color that came. Since I cleaned it, i wont return and will havr to donate"
1.0,Horribly itchy material. Seams are not straight.
1.0,"Don't buy this product!<br />My bother in law bought these for me for Christmas not knowing what they actually cost. These boxes cost ( at full price) $12 each. I went to trade them in for a different size and it turned out that these are actually only worth $4 a piece. So in short when I traded in these two ""$44"" boxes I ended up having to pay $6 for just one pair.<br />DO NOT BUY IT'S A SCAM!"
1.0,These pajamas ripped right across the back in the but area (and I don't have a big but}. Trash. Cute for a month till it ripped
1.0,Dress wasn’t flattering at all
1.0,Runs small<br />Need to exchange for a large please
1.0,The fabric was already unglued when I received it.  I sent it back.
1.0,"Too loose, and the key goes in too deep so you can't put the key all the way in to the door"
1.0,"This sweatshirte is huge.  I have many in this size, and they fit well.  This is more like a XXXL"
1.0,"I ordered a Black Butler necklace, but this has a Star Trek type symbol on it. This item is not eligible for return, so I am basically out my money. Very disappointed."
1.0,I’d give this a zero if I could. There’s nothing worse than trying to sleep with a vice around your stomach. That’s what the elastic band on these pajamas feel like. Most uncomfortable things I’ve ever worn.
1.0,"Bought these for my son. He only wore them for two weeks and the sole started coming apart. Also, the slipper looks smashed down like he’s been wearing them for years! It has only been two weeks! Luckily, we are still within the 30 days return! Very dissatisfied! Especially because they had such good reviews!"
1.0,"The label is simply a lie. There is no cotton in this material. It's plastic, not breathable, not absorbent and certainly not soft. It feels like wearing fine sand paper.  Polyester usually makes a harsher, springier thread than cotton. These days some polyester materials may come pretty close to imitate natural qualities, this one does not."
1.0,The colors of this item is completely off. I suspect this is a picture they took from someone else and tried to duplicate the style. Very disappointing
1.0,"the sizes are wrong<br />i ordered a small size dress<br />more like  extra large pretty much, and for the record<br />im not the skinny thought"
1.0,"This tunic is very unflattering.  It's not form fitting and is super long.  It goes down to my knees and I'm 5'1"".  It is really wide at the bottom as well and just does not look right.  The design and colors were appealing but that's about it.  I would not recommend this top"
1.0,"Terrible quality, looks and feels cheap. Will return."
1.0,"Doesn't even come close to fitting my wrist, and I got the largest size...my wrists aren't even that big."
1.0,Within a month the watch face broke and the second hand fell off. For the money I spent I expected it to last longer. Of course this all happened right after the 30 days were up and I cannot return it.
1.0,"These are L in width, but not in height. Fits fine on the shoulders, but it barely covers my belt. When I raise my arms a little my belly button makes an entrance. Too bad, fabric is awesome. Cannot wear it."
1.0,"Smelled like weird chemicals, cheaply made  and for return had to call amazon customer service since seller did not accept any returns."
1.0,"Text is cheap, glossy, iron on vinyl and much smaller than shown in the listing...Hat is decent quality but the charcoal color is so dark you can barely see the FJB."
1.0,it broke right a way
1.0,"I read the reviews about these being too small, so ordered the L/XL option. They were still too small. I am 5'8, 130lbs and wear a size 4-6 in jeans. The material is great and I really wish they fit, but I will be sending them back."
1.0,"The product online says white, and the pics online show white on top and the same white on bottom. The top looks like pic online but the bottom is not white. It is cream color. Will probably end returning after Christmas when it's opened.<br />False advertisement!"
1.0,Missing a gem in the moon.
1.0,"Very looong one , I couldn’t wear it!"
1.0,I only received the robe. O thought my grand daughter would love this but there was no doll with it. I’m really disappointed and very unsatisfied. Don’t say and doll of it doesn’t come with it.
1.0,The jewels get caught and RIP the fishnets
1.0,"Not plus sized, read fine print"
1.0,"I received the costume promptly. It was good for the price. I bought it for 19.99 with prime shipping. I ordered a small because according to the size chart, that’s what I was. I am 5’3” and it was tight at the shoulders and crotch area. I need a bigger size just for the length. The body portion fit ok, not too tight. I started the return process. I went to order the next size up and the price was 29.99 with 6.95 shipping and it would be here in 2 weeks. So in 2 days, the price went up and they took away prime shipping. So if I want to get the correct size, it’s going to be over 37 bucks  almost double what I payed 2 days ago and take a few weeks. Not cool."
1.0,"The order was not delivered on time, the color is not the dark green as described, and it’s cheaply made, don’t waste your money."
1.0,The description says 60 pieces. I only received 10. They are super cute but $20 for 10 masks is to expensive. I’m so disappointed
1.0,Smaller than what size is stated
1.0,"This item is far from being true to size. It runs very, very small. Now, it just sits in my closet, collecting dust. Very dissatisfied."
1.0,"You get what you pay for. Only one glowed, and the other necklace broke the first time hanging around the neck. I bought a second set so hopefully there will be two total that glow out of four."
1.0,Disappointed with these sandals
1.0,Do not like how these close on ears. Don't feel they will stay on my ears securely.
1.0,"This product was absolutely horrible! I bought this for my father because he loves to work in the garage and it’s always cold in there. First it comes with no adapter, second it does not stay charged unless it’s connected to a battery source. This item is crap, don’t waste your money. Very disappointed in just how low quality it is."
1.0,"The idea is great but the quality not so much. The drink hole is not secured at all,when opening the cap the whole thing come off fabric."
1.0,Feels soft but it’s MASSIVE. I am 5’6” and weigh 140 and I should have bought an XS but bought a M. It’s so cute I’m going to try to take it to the Taylor but they literally would have to take up every single part of t by several inches for it to fit flattering at all.
1.0,seems like it was made for a child
1.0,It Didn’t Come In The Color I Wanted I Don’t Like It
1.0,Way to small I ordered a 4xl it was more like a xl
1.0,"Glasses don't remotely resemble what is pictured. Much smaller, not wrap-around. Certainly not polarized. Even the color is wrong  It appears that someone just grabbed a random pair of cheap dollar store glasses off a shelf and put them in a box."
1.0,Looks cheap and run smaller than true size!
1.0,It has tarnish marks as soon as I opened the package!
1.0,It is not rubber or waterproof...I used it to bathe dogs in my grooming shop and it is certainly NOT waterproof!
1.0,I don’t recommend anyone purchase this product. The fabric is of low quality so it’s see through when standing so obviously it doesn’t pass the squat test. Best bet is to buy from doyoueven.com when in stock.
1.0,Very disappointed. I wore it for less than a month and the time was off. So i corrected the time and the it was still slow and dying. Apparently I bought a dying watch from china and realized that i could even enjoy telling time. I'm a watch lady. I always have a watch and i already thought this was going to be great. Don't buy this watch. It's a rip off.
1.0,not the fit I expected at all. very disappointed.
1.0,They are very smaller than what I expected but the work perfectly.
1.0,The  fabric was rough and so wrinkled. The bottom of the dress was suppose to be flowers. I wear a lg so I got a 2x so it can be loose and it was too tight. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Don't even waste your money on these. They started falling apart after a few months. Garbage.
1.0,The earrings are very thin! The earring post broke the same day. I do not reccomend this to any women. Definitely not worth the price!
1.0,Returned it as soon as I tried it on. This has a very slippery sole and very dangerous to wear !
1.0,Cheap broke while putting it on
1.0,"This was so small it seemed more like a choker.  I gave it to my nephew and it fits him perfectly.  I wish it had been bigger, but I was probably too old for a necklace like this anyhow, so maybe it saved me from myself."
1.0,"Garbage!  Very cheap, do not waist your money.  Barely resembles the picture."
1.0,Worst Stitching
1.0,"These are advertised as 19"" long and suitable for men, which is not true at all. They are absolutely tiny and only suitable for VERY young boys."
1.0,MUCH smaller than it appeared in the pictures.
1.0,"Very cheap material, I returned"
1.0,Horrible fit and cheap material!
1.0,67mm ??????????
1.0,I really liked this when I rec'd it.  Within a week it broke and I lost it.
1.0,"I liked the color, but they came damaged. Whatever they use to  painted them it was still wet. Couldn’t wear them with my outfit I had plan for Africian day on my trip."
1.0,I had to return these and was disappointed that I needed to.  I have wide feet and couldn't make these work.  Wish they would come in wide.
1.0,Would be awesome but the silver was coming off of it when I took it out of the package.
1.0,"Do NOT buy this. While it is well priced, this suitcase trio is not worth trying to get a deal. The largest of the three suitcases had a zipper malfunction before I even started my journey. I packed up the suitcase and discovered that the zipper had broken while I was still at home. The bags have a cheap and very basic feel to them. I figured I was not getting great quality for the price, but I was not expecting such a cheap product. I am now worried if the other suitcases will make it across the country."
1.0,I thought they were more tan. These are more grey. The also show a good bit outside my loafers when wearing.The also show a good bit outside my loafers when wearing
1.0,"Worst product venum has ever come up with. It fell apart the first time I wore it. A rashguard that is glued together? What genius decided that would be good to grapple in. Venum, stick to needle and thread. I give venum a pass because I love their products, generally. DO NOT BUY THIS SPECIFIC RASH GUARD."
1.0,Odd fitting.
1.0,Correct too it’s size!! the only thing is very cheap fabric so no thank you!
1.0,"The dress was returned during to not fitting at all. Also the material felt like plastic inside, so even if it had fit I would have sent it back."
1.0,Not worth buying!!
1.0,"The top was absolutely huge. I am a small C cup so I ordered a size small. The top completely covered my entire breast and showed absolutely no cleavage. It was way too big and the top literallly extended from the bottom of my breast to my neck. Also, the two cups on the top were so big that they ended up cross crossings each other! Moreover, the back clasp only has one hook, so it ended up being too big as well and being droopy. The bottoms fit as expected. Do not buy this unless you have very large breasts and a small bottom. The top could probably fit a DD as a size small! Awful!"
1.0,"Bought this for my daughters birthday, It broke with in a day, very sad someone would sell such a cheep idem."
1.0,"I bought two similar sunglasses as they were  polarized, cheap and light weight.<br />At first I could see they were polarized but after several weeks, it wore off. I was baffled as my headache got so bad that I was only able to tolerate them for a couple of minutes. I finally figured out that the glasses were no longer polarized.  I should have known better not to buy cheap sunglasses.  I bought new Polarized sunglasses from a department store and they work great.  yes they were more expensive but they were worth it.  If you want to save some $ and damage your eyes, these are sunglasses for you."
1.0,After the first use it the threads started to fray and to break apart.
1.0,"The first time I purchase this item I bought the black two-piece set, it fit wonderful, I loved it! I ordered another one in red although I’m very disappointed with the product. It’s not the same material as the first outfit I received, it’s so wrinkly, the pants are too small and the top is way too big. It’s definitely not the same product and they should not be listed together. I will be returning."
1.0,"i dont recommend to buy these sunglasses! quality is very poor, sunglasses don't past to the eyeglasses. i can't wear it ! rubbish!"
1.0,"Bought a 5xl and it does not fit true to a 5xl. Runs small, and the material is harsh and scratchy."
1.0,"Really Poor quality, poor materials"
1.0,These are just tinted cheap glasses that do not help a colorblind person see color.  Falsely advertised.
1.0,Like the concept however the band is too wide and covered up the magnet where the coil sits. The implants just sit in headband not near the ears like the child is used to. My daughter (11 yr old) said it felt weird. In the description it stated try it risk free 30days but when I requested refund it said item is non refundable!!
1.0,Don’t buy. Every single one as broken within a week. Very cheaply made
1.0,Horrible material made me itch. Bands eventually shrink and are too tight around the waste
1.0,Batteries were dead in hat
1.0,"Too big, made cheep."
1.0,I wore this ring one time and it already started turning copper colored. You get what you pay for!!!
1.0,Very bad quality and runs a little big
1.0,Definitely not what I ordered. Barely float. Would not order from this place again. Supposed to be a completely different frame design and color. I would’ve been happier with 6$ glasses at QT gas station if I wanted something this lackluster and unsatisfying
1.0,Fit is good. I wear a 9 ans bought a 9. The toe thing is not comfortable at all. Returning.
1.0,"I received these glasses in black. They came enclosed in a very nice, cloth covered, hard zippered case for protection, accompanied by a cleaning cloth. Even though the glasses in black do not have mirrored lenses as promised on the Amazon detail page, they are still an attractive looking pair of aviator glasses and are quite similar to the much more expensive Raybans  currently on the market. Unfortunately, the similarity ends there.<br /><br />These glasses, which I received from the seller in exchange for an impartial review, sit slightly askew on one's face. That is, one side rests more closely on one cheekbone than the other. Far worse than that is the stench of cigarette smoke to which I am hyper sensitive. The case, the cleaning cloth, the glasses themselves positively reek of smoke. The stench is  so incredibly strong, it is positively disgusting. The glasses are unwearable by anyone  hyper sensitive to smoke, allergic to smoke, or who simply does not want to smell like a used ash tray."
1.0,"The rings are way to small, Doest fit."
1.0,DO NOT ORDER THIS BAND. I'VE RECEIVED 2 WITH NO WAY TO ATTACH IT TO MY WATCH. THE PEICE IS MISSING AGAIN.
1.0,"Very damaged. The box it was in and the packaging was fine, so it must have been damaged before it was even put in the box.<br /><br />Was going to be a gift, but there is WAY too much damage"
1.0,Terrible quality. You get what you pay for.
1.0,The top was extremely see through .The fit itself was fine however but once I put it on it became very apparent that this top was unsuitable for work.
1.0,Terrible product. Seems awful and look like crap
1.0,One of the sleeves on the grey shirt wasn’t as long as the other one. So the shirt looked like a 3/4 sleeve on one side
1.0,"When I ordered this in April, the description said it had a filter pocket and came with six PM2.5 filters. Nope. The pattern is the same. But it has the consistency of a pair of tights. When I opened it, I immediately wanted to return it. But guess what? The return window closed on June 19th for something I got on July 6th. Maybe I can use this as a hair tie."
1.0,Fell apart first day not good quality
1.0,It’s very cheap broke next day
1.0,Had this for about 3 months. Used it less than 5x. I hadn't charged it in a while so I plugged it up and 10min later it started smoking..fried everything..I wish I could I add a picture
1.0,My son was wearing it on the first day and the bracket broke.
1.0,Don’t put it in the dryer!!! These socks shrunk tremendously when I took it out of the dryer! I couldn’t even use it now.. I couldn’t return because I’ve washed it.  No washing instructions. I have other socks like these but it didn’t shrink after taking it out of the dryer..  Waste of money! I am so disappointed because they are really cute.
1.0,"I can’t get this burnt smell out of the dress. I’ve washed it 4 times and it smells like its burnt. Also, the material is so thin that it’s almost see through. I was highly disappointed in this purchase"
1.0,"My daughter is petite, although somewhat &#34;hippy&#34; regularly wears a size 4/6 and could not fit into this bathing suit!  Really surprised! Material was not well made & already had a seam pulling when we took it out of the packaging.  Very disappointed."
1.0,This dress was absolutely god awful. It’s completely see through and made of cheap material. It felt like I was wearing a garbage bag. Not pleased at all.
1.0,"They're really cute but incredibly easy for a small child to break the hinges, simply by bending the flexible rubber back, tearing the rubber hinge and popping out exposed a small pointy screw that can be very dangerous. Just bad design/material choice. They broke on the first day within 20 minutes of use. I tried to fix but it didnt last long, then same problem with the other side."
1.0,On one of the claws there is a chipped part and it hurts the middle of your hand like hell. You can also see the piece that holds the claws. Plus the bend every which way.
1.0,"The band was too small for my wrist, the directions were printed in a tiny font(very hard to read & follow). Setting day date function was difficult to impossible. The analog watch was easy to set & keeps accurate time, and that was the only redeeming quality of this watch."
1.0,My said she can’t breathe in it
1.0,"Had these home two days. Lenses popped out after the first day, and the arm had broken off after two. I didn't expect indestructible, although they are advertised that way. I did hope they would last longer than two days. Lenses became a choking hazard for my DS who loves to put things in his mouth."
1.0,"Anything from size, quality, and customer service is POOR!"
1.0,"I am scheduled to buy 9 months, but the delivery is 3 months，That's too bad！"
1.0,False advertising - you can see the sock and there is NO RETURN after purchase!! Very dissatisfied.
1.0,I'd like to know myself if these masks are as good as reviews say.  But been over a month and still haven't received them.  Just contacted.  See what happens.
1.0,"Cheap, inferior material useage constructing these Sox, had to return upon delivery"
1.0,"Not worth it, looks cheap and not exactly like the picture. The golden parts are not that quite gold, you get what you pay."
1.0,Love the look and colors...but WAY too small.  Not even close in size.
1.0,"I order this product and when it arrive was to small, I was very disappointed,  and didn't look like the material"
1.0,"My granddaughter had these on for five minutes, just walking around inside the house, and they fell apart. Cheap construction and materials. I will try to sew them together because she likes them, but I shouldn’t have to. Would not recommend this product."
1.0,"The band was too small, it was even tight around my neck when i put them on my head to be silly."
1.0,Don't believe all the hype! Do NOT do it. The good reviews are what made me purchase this item. The adhesive didn't stick whatsoever. I am a 34 DD and my boobs are too big for this bra to ever work. Didnt't stick and had no support.
1.0,they're too big and heavy.
1.0,These are awful.  Save your money!  They look very frumpy and were too big.
1.0,Very poor Quality… do not buy this waste my money.
1.0,"The material was as expected, but it ran really big. You get what you pay for. I didn't have the energy to send it back for a smaller size, so I wear it as a nightgown."
1.0,"XXL is tiny fit. Not accurate. Printing also very small. Don’t order from here, order on Etsy."
1.0,They made my ears infected! I paid extra for 2 day shipping because I needed them then they didnt even work!!! DONT BUY they are pink not skin and the flare is really big. dont waste your time.
1.0,Not sure if my Tom Ford order has an authentic product.
1.0,"I'm not sure what kind of tailor has done this dress as it does not properly align to my body.  The back is slanted which pulls on the skirt,  twisting it around and making the inline skirt rid up.  Wore this thw first time on a wedding and I ended up going home to change.  Not recommending a waste of money in this one."
1.0,Waaaay too small. An adult small must be a large in toddlers. Too bad because I liked the pattern.
1.0,"Shirts say machine washable and tumble dry but the shirts shrunk in half height wise, they were still the same width but they turned into crop tops. After some embarrassment and a few tears, I decided to return them for my money back."
1.0,Childrens/Chinese sizing.<br />I fit in a large to xl in everything.<br />I ordered an XL and fits like a US M.<br />Tore immediately as well.....
1.0,Terrible build quality. Wore about a dozen times and it self-destructed. Has tons of tiny pieces and one of them ended up in my new born's bassinet
1.0,Way too small and not long enough!
1.0,"I ordered this for my daughter and we were not happy with it at all. The fit was accurate, but the quality was cheap. The description says it’s cotton so we were expecting it to be like a sweatshirt material. It was not. It looked polyester but there weren’t any labels other than the size tag to indicate what it was actually made of. The letters looked more red than pink and the application looked like it was homemade with cheap product that would peel off after washing. We immediately processed a return."
1.0,arrived broken. not overly attractive.
1.0,"Useless.  The don’t clip on.  They sort of slide on which means they slide off, drop off in fact."
1.0,Do not look ANYTHING like it does in the picture
1.0,This shirt is too short.
1.0,Queda muy Grande
1.0,I honestly didn't these rings at all. I expected something different. The color of the rings makes them look very cheap. Don't recommend buying them.
1.0,These earrings are the size for a baby.  Only get them if you want super small studs.  Quality was ok.
1.0,too thick and heavy
1.0,Feet are GIANT!
1.0,"If your boobs have any size, weight or girth to them keep move on."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I bought these shoes for my girlfriend.  The first time she put them on she realized the interior of the shoes were glued together wrong, the sole was bunchy and uncomfortable, she looked passed that, deciding to get some inserts to put in the shoes. On our way to the store BOTH heels broke off...now this was all within a 10 minute walk to the store.  Now I have read all of these other testimonials that this is not the first time this has happened, and wished I listened to the other customers BEFORE buying these!"
1.0,"Way too big, it falls off my shoulders and looks weird. In process of returning it."
1.0,I have returned 2 because right out of package the LED lights did not work.
1.0,Material is thin and it wrinkles easily
1.0,Cheap junk ...never order again
1.0,"Not long enough for cartiledge.  Crappy design.  They twist off on other sides, so they easily fall off. We have already lost all three pairs"
1.0,cute design but fabric is too thin.
1.0,They do not have the non slip grip on heal of sock. Slide right off after walking 5ft in shoes.
1.0,Sadly this set of lenses does not fit the half jacket 2.0 at all I believe these are actually for the flack 2.0 as they fit perfectly in his
1.0,Size chart isn't even close
1.0,"I am not the smallest person, and there are way too big"
1.0,Wry cheap shoe/boot...you actually get what you pay for with these cheap boots. My advice spend your money on something else. The boot is so cheap that it was 38-40 degrees outside and the boots sounds like plastic against the concrete. Extremely cheap!!!!
1.0,"These are to be worn as an undergarment not yoga pants or shorts! I purchased white and they are extremely see through and thin material. No way could they be worn in a yoga studio I wouldn't even wear them at home doing yoga. Tight, thin but I will wear them under my sundress which is a little thin and will give me a little coverage if it blows up."
1.0,Nothing good to say here.  Look like you are wearing a diaper.  The pockets do not lay flat at all…..nope!!
1.0,I received the chord only
1.0,"I just order a duplicate pair so that I could rotate wearing these great pants and the one that just came in the mail and they were obviously worn… And I don’t mean just to Tryon. No tag inside, smelled like laundry soap, and had worn out marks in the butt. Will be returning but hopefully will be all able to order another pair."
1.0,"The charm itself is beautiful.... Tinier than expected... However, the clasp does not fit any swarovski charm bracelet or any other brand... Was not meant for swarovski or pandora. Clasp too tiny, beware."
1.0,"Was worn twice and the single stitched seam under the arm came apart and the seller just told us ""ok, thanks for letting us know"""
1.0,Why is there such a thing as a slim fit 2xl?
1.0,"Clamp wouldn’t snap, I fault myself for ordering a cheap watch..."
1.0,Was really disappointed that the black pants i got attracts everything from all kinds of lint and just doesn’t look good.
1.0,Literally have to use pliers to open. And when you try to close they are misaligned. I have similar ones with the same type of hinge that are easy to open and close. These are nearly impossible
1.0,"Not a good value, not really wearable, poorly made and shockingly sheer."
1.0,The clasp was receive bent for both earings and one of them was coming off the clasp. The item was not packaged properly in order to protect it from being damaged. The flowers were hard to out back into place because they are made from a wire and some beads are discolored.
1.0,"NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,"
1.0,Smelled funny on arival had to was and all the material bunches up funny and is now uncomfortable to wear. Didn’t happen with other type I bought
1.0,The top I received is a different print than the one posted. The top is also very short...almost like a crop top on me unlike the picture were it seems longer. I even got a large bigger than I usually get. I was disappointed. The top looked like and probably is a cheap knock off from the picture posted.
1.0,"Material is way too sheer.  Took 6 weeks for delivery.  And they charge for a return.  Silly of me to  buy something that cheap,  but I needed something loose for the summer after surgery.  Tossed this in the trash."
1.0,Does not fit small kids to big
1.0,A waste of money . If i could gibe it a zero i would . Didnt even cover my shoulders and i order two sizes bigger .
1.0,These are crazy cheap! Only buy if you intend to use once or twice.
1.0,"This Came broken and was cheap, necklace was broke and the feather was not even on the chain."
1.0,"Very cheap, sheer and impossible to wear without a nip slip. DO NOT BUY!!"
1.0,the sleeves are too loose
1.0,Did not meet my expectations. Advertised as having a built in bra and it doesn’t!
1.0,"got a Medium, Breast area fits well but back is loose and big, like if someone larger than me wore it first"
1.0,This is not what it appeared to be. It’s crap and I warn you buyer beware. I didn’t realize I could not return it until after I got it.
1.0,So bad fabric and cheap! Thin and see-through!<br />It’s not look like the picture!!!!<br />DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"Shirt does not fit the way it does on the model.... the material is bad and the shirt is too big, overall it is very ugly in person"
1.0,please don't waste your money
1.0,"On the small side and really, REALLY thin."
1.0,"I'm 5'3"", 125 lbs and the xxs/xs was too big - both the g-string portion and the waistband. Ladybits come right out :("
1.0,"The leather quality was fine , but the band width wasn't correct, the lock wasn't tight and it caused my $600 watch to fall and got many scratches."
1.0,Glasses work great.  1-starring because my pair had a cosmetic problem (one of the chrome bezels in the corner fell out a day after use).  Contacted company weeks ago to try and return them under warranty and have yet to hear anything from them.
1.0,I ordered a watch band for my Apple 5 watch. I ordered a 44 (that is the size I normally buy) I ordered a 44 this time and it almost wraps around my arm.
1.0,This dress I thought had 3 black stripes but it has 2. Some pictures show 3 but I got 2....
1.0,IT WAS BROKE WHEN IT ARRIVED.
1.0,No stars! The chains are like spray painted and rub off!
1.0,"The person who sew this dress need to go back to the drawing board, how can you measure the hip of the dress so far down below the hip. It seems as if they just used the serger and put these two pieces of materials together. I fit the dress and i could see every pieces of thread pulling apart...Very poorly stitch...i don't know who would give this dress a star...they should have no star that's what it would get from me....VERY DISAPPOINTED.."
1.0,Too wide for me but cute
1.0,Every time I order gloves I always order a medium and they fit perfectly with a little bit of room for wiggle.  These gloves I ordered a medium and they are extremely tight I can’t even bend my fingers into a fist. I checked throughout the whole package and I can’t find anything that indicates with the size of the gloves are.
1.0,"I’ve bought a few pairs of these sunglasses and while I do love them, they don’t seem to last very long before they break at the hinges. I JUST received 2 new pairs last week and the arm broke off of one yesterday. After not even a week of use! I don’t think I will be purchasing more because a week of use is ridiculous."
1.0,It is not working since first delivery
1.0,The white lining that shows up at the center is TOO DISTRACTING and cheapens the overall look. I would be too self-conscious on the beach. RETURNED.
1.0,"So disappointed! We ordered a size large and received a size small, twice!<br />We understand that mistakes happen and opted to keep the wrong size to give away to someone that could wear them. We reordered and received the wrong size AGAIN. So now have returned both pairs of shorts. So disappointing because my daughter really loved them..."
1.0,Not a fan of the material.<br />I wear a size 6 and the large is tight
1.0,"I have Gold Toe socks that have lasted five years.  Now I’ve bought my first bunch since they shifted production to China… a mistake I won’t repeat, thanks to a big hole that opened up after a grand total of one wearing.  Thin as paper!"
1.0,Definitely not a value purchase.  Cute but not durable and way too much $ for what you get.
1.0,"Blue one don't look nothing like the one in this ""advertisement """
1.0,"I had high hopes of a teva like sandal. They arrived and I wore them for exactly 15 minutes. The straps along the top of the foot were weird, didn't actually fit the foot well (they were too high on the foot). I would say the arch was not exactly supportive but not bad. Then I stepped on a tiny stick and it went directly through the sole and into my foot. No thank you. I returned them. I need shoes I can safely walk outside in."
1.0,The size was perfect but the quality unfortunately is not as good. My son wore his for the first time this weekend on our family getaway and he ended up with a tear in it when he bent down to help his little brother.
1.0,Grandson had these less than a month before one of the shoes stopped working.  Very poor quality.
1.0,The embroidery is printed. It’s literally a picture of the skirt printed onto some sort of cheap material. Terrible. Waste of money. If I could leave a zero star review I would.
1.0,"Los primeros dos pares que se han utilizado, se rompieron fácilmente."
1.0,The adhesive does not stick very well. It would unstick and shift so the girls were no longer together.
1.0,Poor quality lace and craftsmanship.  Not worth the price.  Would not purchase again.
1.0,"This item looked nice but after about 5 uses, the front snap ripped entirely off - cannot be fixed.  Very disappointed with the poor construction.  DO NOT RECOMMEND."
1.0,Product is much cheaper quality than I expected. I used it to replace broken purse strap.
1.0,"I have owned these exact shoes before and loved them, obviously, since I bought another pair. These are not Saucony shoes, they are a knock off. They are horribly uncomfortable and gave me blisters when running. Very disappointed and will not buy shoes from Amazon again."
1.0,Not for summer
1.0,This dress is a cute style except for the material.  The material is itchy and extremely hot and not breathable.  Don’t buy this if you want to stay cool.
1.0,Allergic reaction
1.0,Not as pictured much too small!!!! very disappointed!!!!
1.0,I bought two of these and they both started coming apart in the first 3 days. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Pretty but faded quick and turned my finger green
1.0,"What I assume is part of the spring mechanism came protruding out of the back of one of these the very first time I tried to put it on, rendering it unwearable."
1.0,"Maybe I am a little tough on belts, but the outside of this one has started flaking off after only a couple days' wearing."
1.0,"no user manual in the box or online , very unprofessional"
1.0,"Way too small. The size chart is for american sizes and this shirt is off by at least 4 sizes if not more. I usually order a size up for overseas made clothes so it should have at least fit and been slightly snug.  when I held it up, it only lined up about 2/3rds from 1 shoulder to barely my other collarbone. It was laughably small.  The seller needs to adjust the sizes they are claiming these shirts to be because they are cute but are clearly meant for only super skinny people."
1.0,I ordered a 3xl but it fits more like a 2xl.
1.0,"way too small, this is a babys mask, i cant even get it over my mouth and nose at the same time and i have a small face, and the box has something sticky all over it, absolutely disgusting."
1.0,"Its comfortable and fits over my glasses but lens came out when it fell off my face, very disappointed that it wouldn't go back in. Would love a replacement for the Leopard one, thanks 😩😔🥴😖"
1.0,"Terrible quality, WAY too small, and even if it would've come close to fitting my daughter, I wouldn't have let her wear it---the bottoms are completely see through, not lined at all. Cheap cheap cheap.  It's not a bargain if you can't even use it--save your $."
1.0,Carving is too small to read and the ring is not all that comfortable: a bit boxy…
1.0,Soooo cute but…..Ripped within one hour of using. All of my contents fell out… my bad got not having it zipped. I will be returning.
1.0,I  could not put my head thru the opening of  this shirt. Terrible.  Made for a baby head.
1.0,Too small I returned this  I wear a 12 and ordered the large.  It did not fit
1.0,This dress is not for tall women who is 5'10 or taller. It barley touches your ankles. I had to return my dress as the length was too short. Not cute for tall women. I am 5'10 185 lbs i ordered a size 12.<br />I contacted thw seller to return the dress they sent me a return label but stated that they will be charging me a shipping fee which they will be taking out of my refund money. I paid for my dress to be expedited but because it was not long enough I had to return. Becareful when buying as they charge you to send things back and will deduct out of your refund. I do not like that it done that way.
1.0,"Striking,artsy and reasonable"
1.0,having a lobster claw clasp on the necklace defeats the purpose of have a LOCKING necklace
1.0,"Huggie clasp not strong, lost one within 24 hours."
1.0,"Very low quality material, and the garment looks like it’s children’s size."
1.0,"The fabric pattern & color is perfect, but does not stretch at all.  The fit is small even in large size...  ????"
1.0,Smell was horrendous - like mold and chemicals combined. I couldn’t even bring it in the house. I tried to air it out but it did not get any better even after a few days. I sent it back.
1.0,The ruffle is not it a ruffle. It is a ugly piece of lace sewn to the shirt. It is cheap and not worth any amount of money.
1.0,"Received purse dirty with black film and rust stains on it. No big deal, when most of it came off with a wet cloth but, “metal” piece that holds shoulder strap broke on day 2 of using it."
1.0,"I received the package on time however, they earrings were not even in a box just wrapped in the invoice, and fell apart, the backing was bent the, not even the earrings shown the in description either. Very disappointed and highly annoyed!!"
1.0,These offer no support at all.  Comfortable but pretty useless.  Why wear them at all?
1.0,No me gusta bastante incomodo poco durable no ajusta lo que esperaba
1.0,Horrible shoes! I work 12 hour shifts at a manufacturer and these shoes are murder to my feet no support no comfort DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,"So disappointed - wish i had listened to some of the other reviews. Leather strap broke off in less than 6 hours of use - didn’t hang it off anything, barely touched it in fact, and somehow it managed to tear that quickly. Waste of money - I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,The earring wear to small even though they are labeled as the right size
1.0,turned my belly button green after a couple days of wear
1.0,Made with cheap materials and not true to size
1.0,Cute but see through thin and arrived dirty definitely won’t order from this company again
1.0,I paid extra to have it delivered YESTERDAY!!!  it was just delivered at 6:20 pm today.  I hope I’m getting my $8 back since I’m already on my vacation with an old bathing suit!  The suit might be great.  Idk cuz it’s 4 states away!!
1.0,bad quality! terrible fabric. First time in my life that a shirt is broken in the first use.
1.0,"Was bulky , too heavy for a baby"
1.0,One clasp is broken. Unable to wear. Very sad as theses were a Christmas gift. Please replace ASAP. Don't want a refund just a wearable pair. These are very pretty.
1.0,"The design on the product received was not at all like the product in the pictures. I received 2 with some sort of panda looking thing, 2 with some sort of character, and the rest were just a red bandana looking crap. Will not recommend buying from here again. I can’t even give these things away let alone wear them myself."
1.0,Dissapointed in quality. Thin fleece around seam came apart. Item returned
1.0,Muy horrible una terrible cálida
1.0,This looked nothing like the photos. The black is faded to a sickly looking grey and the yellow is also faded to a sickly yellowish green like it’s been sun bleached for days on end. The zipper was also broken.
1.0,"Seriously this was the worst. The quality of shirt is not good. I purchased a large, I am 5'4 165lbs. I have no problem in larges and I can fit in mediums also. However this hardly went past my belly button, and it was to wide. Very disproportional. I ended up giving it to my 12  year old and she didn't like it either. Keep shopping!"
1.0,"I hardly give a review but I'm so disappointed that I had to! This short sucks! I don't know why it's not the same as the picture. This short looks like a fat grandmother wear! I'm 100 lbs, and 5""4 tall. Waistline is 26-27inches. This is wayyyyy to freaking big than what's in the description! I was hoping that it would look exactly the same as it says and the picture. I tried them on and they look like I'm wearing a mini skirt! I check every details when I buy clothing here on Amazon, and this, I will not recommend it!! Waste of time."
1.0,"These gloves are garbage they rip very easily and would give Negative 5 stars.. They don't provide any protection,  as a medical professional if I was in the law business would make them illegal and a criminal act to own or to buy them.. and would even make a bill to out law them.."
1.0,"I purchased this for $17.99 but later saw it for  $6.99 from a different seller. This is not why I give it 1 star. This is completely see through, flimsy, and just plain cheaply made. It's not even made well enough to sell in a $5 store."
1.0,Too small across the top. The sleeve's are too tight and I ordered a size bigger than I wear.
1.0,No está en mis pedidos
1.0,Rubber band already broke.  Not even a week in. I would recommend if rubber band was of better quality
1.0,I let the majamas but the shirt was too small
1.0,"The dress is not lined, so it is very see through, at least the white one. Also just cheap looking fabric. Will be returning."
1.0,It wasn’t leather. Smells bad.<br />Will be returned ASAP.
1.0,"I brought these for my son, and as he was trying them on three of the fingers ripped ON BOTH gloves!!!!"
1.0,"I was shocked to receive this shirt in a ziplock bag with no tags and WITH A STAIN on the center front! I requested a replacement because it did fit well and was the weight of tee shirt material I was looking for. The replacement arrived in a ziplock bag with no tags as well! It didn’t have a stain, but the neckline has a flaw in the sewing! This is a very low quality tee shirt!"
1.0,The size is too big for a one year old. If you have a petite child this will not be the perfect choice as it is made to fit 12 to 18 months and it’s made more for 18 month olds than 12.
1.0,I recieved short hats
1.0,There is no hole to wrap this dress. I’m glad it wasn’t expensive because I wasted the $ spent on it. It’s also very very large for a 2 x
1.0,"I've written very favorably about this brand in the past. Currently it demonstrates the reason one should not buy initially inexpensive Asian products. Everything I liked about it has changed w/o notice. The price has gone up considerably. The quality has gone down considerably. The last few things I've purchased used a different fabric blend, lighter in weight, uncomfortable to my skin and given to a lot of vertical shrinkage. Before I wrote this review I contacted the vendor/manufacturer to see if I could return them and get something in the original fabric. I received an unsatisfactory reply saying that I must know that different items require different fabrics, that they would refund the money on the last item I had received and that my outstanding orders would be cancelled. They also said not to bother to return anything. I guess the company didn't think the items were worth the price of the return. I don't think the order was worth the price of shipping to me and that was free. No more unknown Asian brands for me."
1.0,"This was the worst fitting bathing I've ever tried on.  I have a slightly longer torso, so I tend to size up to a L for one-piece suits.  I'm typically a M in a 2 piece.  This suit was laughable.  It was way too short in the torso - like 2"" too short. I could barely stretch the straps over my shoulders.  And it gaped like crazy in the chest - I probably need to go up about 3 cup sizes to maybe fit the top.  So I guess if you have a really short torso and big boobs, maybe this will work for you."
1.0,Pretty bad the Whistles  Don't work on any of them I will not buy here again
1.0,My husband finally was able to use this pack on a long hike.  The shoulder straps that tighten ripped right out of the seam on the first tug to tighten it!!  Not worth the money.  Not constructed well.
1.0,"Do not waste your money on this bracelet. It is a piece of garbage. Looks cheap in person and does not look like the picture. The love piece is separate and dangles. Both sides are connected by small rings. The one is tightly fastened, but still turns and dangles until you connect the other side. Good luck. Grabbing that ring and connecting it is a real challenge. The problem is, once connected, it comes back off immediately. I tried everything. When my husband found out how much it was, he said send it back. It is not worth even $20. I e-mailed the seller, and gave me directions to send it back. Oh, and to make sure I insure it!! I should not have to pay the cost of returning this item that is either faulty, or an idiot designed it. I am so angry. I did not think I would get treated like this from someone that sold on Amazon. I had nothing to go on as their were no reviews. 1st clue."
1.0,Not worth it. It didn't stay strapped on. They all fell off
1.0,"Everything, this dress was horrible"
1.0,Really did not like them at all.
1.0,"I bought this product despite bad reviews because I figured it would work best for smaller bra sizes. It didn't fit properly at all, looked very awkward. Definitely don't recommend because it doesn't stick well, and the clasp is not the same as the one pictured. Overall really poor quality product."
1.0,Highly.disappointed with this watch. After less than a week of wearing it it started to fade and lose color. Don't buy total waste of money
1.0,Too tight<br />Too short and yes I ordered the right size
1.0,The rings are very small they don’t even fit my 11 year olds ringers they are for petite size fingers
1.0,Loved the way it looked but but after 10-12 days it broke.
1.0,junk! the crosses fall off the chains! won't stay on necklace ! sitting in the bottom of my jelewry box!
1.0,The size wasn’t right at all. It might have said the size I wanted but definitely wasn’t the size it was meant to be.
1.0,Very disappointed. Looks nothing like the listing pic. I understand screens are all diff but come on..you cant even see the jacket decal its so dark and dull..
1.0,Already broke after a day just won’t work
1.0,0 stars. Save yourself some money and buy a black shirt and some iron on paper. Print the design and iron it on. It’s bound to be better quality than this shirt. This is the quality you get from anime/kpop stores in the corner of a run down mall. The front logo isn’t a patch it’s an iron on sheet that stretches that stretches and cracks. I should have known better.
1.0,This dress was horrible. Don’t buy.
1.0,This is NOT an adult size hat! ONLY GOOD FOR KIDS.
1.0,"I ordered a medium and it was too small, reordered an extra large and it fit exactly the same as the medium."
1.0,too big size and too cheap material..
1.0,Dress look and feel cheap fabric
1.0,Zipper broke the first time he wore it very disappointed!
1.0,"If there was a review that I could say scam, I Would.  I felt like I was buying the real blue blockers. Then get cheap, poor Chinese quality glasses. The kind you get at wholesale or festivals for $5. Very disappointed."
1.0,"2nd time I tried to buy this, I recently lost back down to a solid 14, the 16/18 still wouldn't even pull up over my hips. The whole slimming/shaper sections are just too much"
1.0,The product is very ugly. Looks like I picked it out of a trash can. Looks very cheap. Was not worth the money. Fabric not what I expected.
1.0,It looked great however it arrived broke.
1.0,"Bought these as a gift received my bracelets and they do not say what is shown on the picture, definitely bummed out and will return."
1.0,With clearance I just thought It looks okay and the design was Good but when I directly came Through this top it absolutely looks worst I have Choosed the return option yet I did not receive any Mail .
1.0,"Description states LEATHER.  It is thin shinny vinal! I like the style of the bag, hope it holds up for more than a month as others have stated. I am going to keep it as it was cheap.  Should of known for that price it would not be real leather. So much junk out there!"
1.0,I ordered a small but it looks like a large. And very poor quality
1.0,Great material.  Not really stretchy though. I ordered a 2xl to be safe and it fit like a large. I couldnt even attempt to close it
1.0,"was not dark green, it is teal. I was so disappointed when i opened this up because i ordered it for a color party and could not even go the actual color i was which was green, not teal!"
1.0,Hole is to small for Pandora 😔
1.0,Not me well looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Too small and you can see right through it!
1.0,Look at the pictures of this in pink- now look at my photos. Completely different material!! I know a girl who got this exact product but in green from this exact company and it looks exactly like it is shown. But I got the pink and it’s obviously just a look alike to the photo- but doesn’t even look like it. Requested to return. Will be returned!!
1.0,No padding or protection for knees a joke of padding for hips. Almost non existent. Complete rip off
1.0,"Material &#62; Bad , shrinks in first wash , colors bleed.<br />Fitting &#62; Bad , the waist has a horrible elastic that si too tight on the waist and leaves a mark if worn for too long and the elastic does not stay in place during wash and ends up all twisted within the area.<br />Not too happy. Will rather invest some time going to the store to pick up clothes for my kids rather than ordering here."
1.0,"Received this the end of January, broke today"
1.0,"Doesn't stay on, not waterproof, hard to read and color rubbed off first time wearing it :-("
1.0,"No opening, no way to get it around a small child's neck. I will have to cut off the tooth and make a functional necklace from this. The tooth is nice, though."
1.0,Go up a size or two to get a comfortable loose fit… They run real small
1.0,I ordered a size higher and still got a much smaller size
1.0,They are very small the number 13 and I am requiring me to be changed by the next number and they do not act soon to my request they are finishing my patience and my son is very sad it was a wait 24 days to receive them too long.
1.0,It was very small and the material much thinner than anticipated.
1.0,"I didn't get the dress I ordered. I ordered a pretty blue and gray chiffron design and got an ugly flowery design. The ugly dress looks like it fits but I wouldn't wear it so it was a waste of $5, but I guess you get what you get when you buy cheap."
1.0,The material is nothing like what you’d think. It’s extremely see-through and clings to your body in all the wrong places. The tie is cute but I’ll never wear it and I wouldn’t recommend it.
1.0,"The leopard print in the letters is UGLY!!! it's not brown, cream and black leopard print. this is bright orange, black and cream colored. looks stupid."
1.0,"The bottoms are too thin and small, the top pads are too thick and you can see the pad when it is wet or not wet."
1.0,"I sent for the peacock blue robe because I liked the navy blue one I received so well. The peacock blue robe had several stains on the front and  the fit wasn't quite right, even though it was the same size and style as the navy one."
1.0,It broke off of the chain...
1.0,"I ordered the burgundy,  it said burgundy and all I got was a straight up RED"
1.0,It came crushed
1.0,Belt buckle would not close do to the manufacturer's design. The actual nylon belt prevented it from closing.
1.0,Way to small if I order from here it needs 2 b 2 sizes bigger.
1.0,This bag IS NOT LEATHER. It has LEATHER accent pieces but the bag itself is faux leather.
1.0,As a person woo can easily fit for medium size boxers these were too tight and went to trash
1.0,"not wide enough to actually hold a hair elastic, don't bother"
1.0,Not even a month with them and the arm broke off as I was putting them on. Very flimsy!!
1.0,Bought a size larger for our daughter and it was still too small. Tried to send it back to the company and was offered less then half and to keep the hoodie that was too small. We had to go through Amazon to get a full refund.
1.0,"Harmful material, not good for child"
1.0,"Dont buy this product. After a couple of months, the lens started to peel  or stain.. appears a white stain in all the border , that grows al over the lens."
1.0,the handle ripped off the first time i used it. it is a tiny bag . wouldn't buy it again
1.0,"The beads appear to be made of plastic, some synthetic, or even a cheap wood...definitely NOT Amber Stone as advertised. I have returned the item and currently awaiting my refund."
1.0,Hermosa pero no me quedo zise muy pequeño
1.0,"These make my daughters ears itch, they change colors after the 1st use. Not worth the few bucks I spent."
1.0,"Even though this tie says that it is a ""Purple Dark Blue"" color, there is no doubt that this is a purple tie with absolutely no blue.  I ordered it thinking the color on my screen may be misleading - towards being more blue-ish in person - but in fact the tie is a bit lighter and very very purple."
1.0,Item didn’t work/broken
1.0,"smelled like chemicals when I received it, so I washed it and is shrunk. very cheap fabric used you can almost see through it the thread count is so small."
1.0,Quality wasn’t great and definitely wasn’t kids size.
1.0,This dress was cheep and way too short. I tried to return it but got no reply from the seller.
1.0,We bought this umbrella and the initial product- the lights did not function.  Flame and Shade were excellent.  They mailed us a new one and it works beautifully. They were easy to work with and super accommodating.  From reading reviews these solar lights are sensitive.
1.0,"This is the cheapest possible dress material. It’s shiny, itchy, ugly and very uncomfortable. I can’t even fathom how people leave five star reviews for such items!"
1.0,This beautiful blouse fits very small. It doesn't matter the size u get if you are not slim bodied it won't fit. It was not designed for medium sized body woman.
1.0,Not a sweater at all. Think stretchy gym pants fabric. Stripes didn't line up at seam so it looks cheap.
1.0,the rings slowly lose color after a couple weeks. I wouldn't suggest purchasing.
1.0,"I have only worn these socks a handful of times and each time it is extremely uncomfortable and ripped. They were not made for larger people; my thighs pour over them, the roll down when you sit down (had to buy garters), the anti-slip band just has plastic dots inside. I should have realized these wouldn't work when the only model wearing them is tiny. If it was medically necessary I wouldn't wear them ever again, can't wait to get replacements"
1.0,Fabric is poor quality- doesn’t really look like picture.
1.0,turning brown
1.0,Fabric was more of a thermal than summer cotton matetisl. I returned it.
1.0,"I purchased this in April, it’s now June and the back of it is turning colors?"
1.0,discolored after two wears...
1.0,Using it as a wall hanging decor in my bathroom. It’s too big to actually wear and the chain is super cheap
1.0,After only 2 weeks of working the winder stopped turning. It makes roaring sounds and not turning.
1.0,MY PACKAGE WAS NOT SEALED. THIS HAT WAS ALMOST $20 ALONE.  NOW ITS MISSING UPON DELIVERY!
1.0,"Not an actual fossil brand charger, the product picture and specification says FOSSIL charger"
1.0,"I had to return this dress. It has a funny type of material that is not forgiving or flattering to the body. Its also kinda thin and any type of undergarment would show through. It was also very long, this is not a bad thing because it gives the gown a train. The gown runs large."
1.0,I liked them at first because the lenses were clear. But the plastic frames are fragile. They broke very easily. It was ridiculous how easy.
1.0,I’ll be returning asap. Not at all worth the money.
1.0,I washed this sweater on my hand wash cycle in cold water and hung to dry. There is yarn sticking out all over the sweater and it is ruined!!! Beware of this when purchasing.
1.0,Se puso negro y feo
1.0,I was specifically looking for a small orange slice bag. The description says orange but the bag is definitely yellow. Now I have to fool with returning which is pretty annoying. Description needs updating.
1.0,Does not fit as described I purchased a large and someone who wears a small would be lucky to fit it.
1.0,It looks like it’s not original it looks cheep
1.0,"Shiny, thin material and reminds me of one of my grandmother's nightgowns. Really clings to the body as well.  Way overpriced for the quality. Returned it immediately."
1.0,They look pretty on the picture but one of the ear clipping is shorter than the other one
1.0,Awful sweatshirt. Pattern does not look like the pictures. Would NOT buy again.
1.0,It was all wrinkled and sent it back it looked awful
1.0,More of a sarong cheap thin fabric
1.0,Do not recommend getting these. They are shipped in a padded envelope and came a little bent up. The lenses are poor quality with distortion. Can't wear them for long.
1.0,"Got this for my daughter’s 2nd birthday party. The thread on one of the letters off shirt is coming out. It looks pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for."
1.0,This was very cheaply made - material hideous. Not solid black was black with white spots - just plain cheap.<br />Will not buy from there again. I didn't even try on but wouldn't let me write a review without selecting how it fit.<br />Definitely should not be compared to a sweatshirt. Thin and heck I don't even know how to describe it....
1.0,"This is not at all what it’s advertised as in the picture. It’s very cheaply made, the stitching is whack, it’s baggy. It basically just makes you look like a walking tie dye tent. Fit isn’t flattering at all. I wanted to wear it for my birthday and once I tried it on, decided I will never wear it."
1.0,I would not recommend this product. Very poorly made
1.0,Itchy and cheaply made I couldn’t even keep it on my body to try on it’s so itchy
1.0,"These are nice looking and really big, but the pattern is printed on the surface, and so, it wasn't long before it rubbed off on my son's forehead and left a blank spot on the thing.  He won't wear them."
1.0,This is not a watch winder
1.0,I wouldn't want anyone to see me in it.  Wasted my money on this one.
1.0,I had a bad experience with this product. The first one that came in was broken and a replacement was sent to me. The replacement one will not clip on my glasses despite the listing stating that it will attach to any frames. This was a complete waste of my money. I would not advise this purchase.
1.0,These are large for a little girl. My daughter is 4 and they are huge. The lenses are clear and see through. I thought they were going to be a nice smoky color and appropriate for my little girl... I was wrong.
1.0,Slit on one of the legs
1.0,This hat is very uncomfortable.  Feels like wearing a piece of cardboard on your head.
1.0,Looks beautiful. The sizing is majorly off. Definitely cheap China made crap.
1.0,"These shorts are more like cheaply made volleyball spandex because of the awful material and very short length. The scrunch isn't even in the right place, it's more on my back. Shipping also took FOREVER! It also does not allow you to track your item. It will say ""shipped"" the entire time. so, it's a surprise on when you will get them. Just know you will be disappointed if you buy these."
1.0,Readers eye glasses.  These were the worst glasses I’ve looked thru. The lens seemed foggy and scratched
1.0,I didn't know it couldn't be machine dried.
1.0,"After using this for one day, the top straps cut the top of my foot. Perhaps its the material, but I did not expect to have the strop scrape the top skin of both of my feet."
1.0,Way too small very deceiving on line buyer beware
1.0,Washed inside out on delicate cycle the day I got it and the letters are peeling.  Sending it back.
1.0,"It is very pretty, but it broke within a day of wearing it.  The dangling part broke off once, and I managed to get it screwed back on, but it did it again the same day.  Waste of money."
1.0,I was horrified after buying a 49ers apron for my aunt. She opened it up and the SF logo was upside down!  So embarrassed. No clue how this could have even happened. Brutal.
1.0,These are a different color than what's pictured. They're like a bright candy apple green. I was under the impression they were going to be more of a neutral forest green. Disappointed.
1.0,"To type through hips and waist for one, too tight through thighs and waist the other."
1.0,This cheap heavy polyester had to be left in someone's closet from the 1960s
1.0,"I ordered an xx-large. The actual size of the product was more like a small, The fabric was very thin and of poor quality. Big mistake on my part thinking with the low price to expect a better product"
1.0,"I liked the idea. They were very cheaply made. The backs did not lock, so the backs always fell off. Lost one of them and then the bullet portion separated from base."
1.0,I tried everything I could to make these work. EVERYTHING. I rolled the adhesive like they said.. made sure it was pushed into the holes.. and no. No. No. No. Anddd NO?!! At some point from me trying it cracked between the teeth.  Then.. I thought...ok. Let's just break it apart and see if I could get it to work... NO. NOTHING NOTHING WOULD MAKE THESE WORK. THERES NOTHINF FOR IT TO STICK TO. NOTHING. TERRIBLE DESIGN
1.0,These used to be the best glasses I could find. Design change to interchange lenses means the nose piece never stays in place.
1.0,Don’t buy this this thing is junk. It’s so thin when you stretch to put it on you can damn near see-through through it. When you hold it in light it has a weird blue color to it and it just so happens that blue is the only color that deer see that stands out like a sore thumb. I would not recommend this to anyone. Would have given zero stars but if you don’t at least give it one they won’t let you leave a review.
1.0,"The beige is actually white. Still cute earrings, but don't call a duck a cat cause it's not."
1.0,"I paid about $15 for this necklace and the pendant has so a cheap look and feel that you wouldn’t believe it. It’s very light weight and thin. This item shouldn’t cost even $10. NOT worthy. The only good thing is the resize is very glow in the dark, charges pretty good with the  light."
1.0,Awkward length. Cheap material. Tight sleeves and huge everywhere else.
1.0,It broke after first time wearing it.  Very cheap!
1.0,Ordered in XL to have a roomy fit and it didn’t even fit my size small daughter. This runs VERY SMALL!
1.0,The price is such a ripoff. You can find the necklace at Hot Topic for like $10
1.0,"One leg was longer than the other, the pattern wasn't the same color on both legs, and the thigh piece didn't wrap all the way around"
1.0,Very cheap material. Would have been too hot to wear in July- even in air conditioning! Biggest issue is that an XL fits more like Small
1.0,"Super cute, unfortunately after one wash and hang drying the bottom legging stitching seam broke on two of the pairs."
1.0,love the button but the battery isn't that great
1.0,The dress looks nothing like the picture. I asked for a refund and they approved for me to return the item but it was going to cost me 27.75 to send back and I only paid 17.99 for for dress.
1.0,The material is very thick. Hard to breath through.<br /><br />The balloon animal print is blurry on the fabric.<br /><br />I purchased to wear while twisting balloon animals but that is not going to happen.
1.0,"Nice color, well made, very nice material & a lot of room in the rear. 😳<br />Didn’t flatter me because I have a tiny butt."
1.0,I loved these until I found out that the skull is not stainless steel. I am very disappointed 😞
1.0,The &quot;love&quot; is hot glued on to the hat. Parts are coming off. Horrible.
1.0,The stones were super loose. I had to take it out because it was so short that it irritated my piercing
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d1dfc4053ea7cd2fa913dc7e4363ac95]] In no way are these bendable or unbreakable they are just regular glasses complete hard plastic like you would get from anywhere else. Put you in the mind of a frame of a Dollar tree reader cheater
1.0,Horrible description of a low quality item.  Color is complete opposite of the spectrum - came in a light sand/khaki hue.  Not nearly as gathered as pictures shirt.  Side seams pulled.  Seller not offering full return on obvious misrepresentation of pictured shirt
1.0,Received this broken
1.0,I ordered two pairs of these socks in royal blue for my son. One pair arrived USED. Major piling and found cat/dog hair on them. We were pretty disgusted.
1.0,"Waited forever for delivery, misleading size. Useless. Gave it to goodwill. Will not purchase from this seller again"
1.0,"Not even close ordered a XX, still not big enough"
1.0,It's a waste of money.
1.0,They were great 2 weeks into wearing them mon-Fri and the rubber part on the toe is coming off! The whole toe of the shoe is odd it looks like my sons been wearing them for years! Don’t purchase if you want the to last more then 2 weeks
1.0,Too short not a dress at all not even close.
1.0,Smelled really bad.  Also rubbed marks on outside piping.
1.0,The material is thin and cheap.  Wrong font on embroidery. Will be returning for refund. Buyer beware!
1.0,This item is NOTHING like the picture....very disappointed.
1.0,"Ordered a two hat set, one fit, albeit tightly, the other was child sized, I couldn’t pull it over my head. I could see cardboard sticking out of the brim on one of them. They’re fairly inexpensive but you could do much better by paying more."
1.0,Discs were way too big.  Looks off on.
1.0,The earrings are nice but cheaply made.
1.0,"This is nice in theory, but the fabric is thin and the buttons don't actually do much - they create big gaps of space in between if you have it buttoned up.  It's pretty much a glorified see-through paper t-shirt scarf.  I returned mine with no issues."
1.0,Not at all like photo.
1.0,Don’t get it. The other comments are true I hoped they were because it’s so cute but it doesn’t stay up
1.0,Poor quality.  Colors on top of dress do not match bottom of dress.  Just cheap quality which I should have suspected considering price.
1.0,The quality of this top is GARBAGE!
1.0,The shirt is hard and the it looks nothing like the pic. I picked white as the color but received and ugly beige colored shirt. I won't recommend anyone to buy this shirt.
1.0,Broke as soon as I put it on. Couldn’t return it cause they were going to have me ship and pay it to back to China.
1.0,Like having a white SeaBees hat. Dislike the spelling is wrong on the rear of the cap.
1.0,The product if too small for measurements on the chart
1.0,"These are not 14mm, more like 9-10. They were also dented on the front. Took forever to arrive. Not worth the hassle of returning. Disappointing."
1.0,"Really, really awful.  I would advise other people not to waste their money.  I bought these for my 6 year old daughter who loves miraculous lady bug.  The pictures look pretty nice but in reality the background looks like faded red paper even the white shine is faded.  Now I will have to look for better ones and spend more money."
1.0,The doggone belt don't LOCK.....Wasted my money
1.0,"I bought this wallet two times now, and each time the clasp broke in the exact same way. At first, I thought I dropped it, and that was what caused this to break. There is no way that I could break the clasp twice in exactly the same way. I really like the idea of having a small compact wallet like this one, but I kept dropping mine. The damage it received from me dropping it, is not why I am rating this a one star. I am giving this product one star is because the clasp keeps breaking and it is hard to keep all your stuff in the wallet without it."
1.0,I was too thin not wat I wanted !
1.0,"I ordered a 3X to wear as an oversized hoodie. It’s barely a US size 4. It’s cheap, terrible fabric and shame on me for not realizing I wouldn’t be able to return easily. $$ down the drain. Do. Not. Buy."
1.0,"I was very excited to get this skirt because it looked so cute and comfortable online! It took three weeks to get here and when I put it on it was super comfortable and fit great in the waist but the bottom hem is all messed up! One side of the skirt is literally higher than the other side so one ankle is showing while the other is covered and there's a bunch of excess material in the middle dragging on the ground. It's literally longer on one side than the other and looks stupid, I am so disappointed because it could really be a cute and comfortable skirt."
1.0,There is nothing I like about this garment at all .The fabric is shines and it looks cheap neckline is horrible  I really wish to had work because the picture  of the item looks really nice Not at all what I expectedI I am returning the item. Not a good fashion look for me
1.0,"I just got this delivered, It’s not red, it’s orange!!!"
1.0,I find it..  remarkable that 5 people actually bought this.. incredible skirt. Good heavens it is ugly.
1.0,"Looks nice, seems soft, my wife liked the look.  BUT.  Pocket thread is all falling apart before even taking out of the package.  There is a huge pile of thread that came undone."
1.0,That is was very small
1.0,Did not work at all. The ribs kept falling against my body & making my dress sag and drag to the ground.
1.0,Do not bay this pants The material is same like a floor cloth The size I don't now what size is it the hip M the waist XL
1.0,Made in China.<br />Don't waste your money on these glasses.<br />Lenses are barely progressive and the lenses are out of since with each other.<br />You can get vertigo after wearing them.<br />They are cheap for a reason!
1.0,Sizing was all over the place with this. No way it would fit a newborn.
1.0,They only worked right for one day. Sending them back
1.0,The masks are all different sizes.  They are poorly cut.  Looks like someone cut them with scissors by hand.  They are also very thin.  Not able to wear them for any type of protection.
1.0,It is a very pretty necklace. it apart as soon as I put it on. cheaply made
1.0,"This chain is absolutely terrible. It turned black in less than a week, and tore my neck up, causing severe pain. The seller and delivery were no problem at all.... But the quality of this product was abhorrent."
1.0,Ripped the 3rd time i wore them at the inseam.
1.0,"Piece or cr#p. Have is a little over a year the hinge seoerated and it broke , don’t buy it"
1.0,Had to return because it was way too large
1.0,"NOt a bad looking piece, I would say to order a size down but if your tall and have a long torso like I do, expect it to be somewhat short, like a crop top in the front but longer in the back. I purchased this to have a nice flowy dress top when you don’t feel like wearing something tight, didn’t work out.<br />Additionally, they specified free returns for the size I ordered; I had to pay for return shipping. False advertising."
1.0,"Way tooooooo small, cheap material too!"
1.0,This product is cheap and flimsy. The bracelet does not lay as shown and is much bigger and uneven. I ended up giving it to my daughter as a play bracelet.
1.0,"Returned, not a good quality and see thruogh"
1.0,I ordered these for a Luna moth costume and they are not at all as pictured in the ad. I had to return other items I bought going off this ad and totally change plans for the shoot.
1.0,"This is NOT small - this measures 9 x 12! I wanted a SMALL purse, not something big that I already have. Please, get your description and measurements accurate!!  Very frustrated."
1.0,"Don’t waste your money!  Took an incredibly long time to arrive and they do not have any SPARKLES inside, if they did they melted and does not look anything like the picture.  I had ordered seven of these necklaces......in January.  They arrived in March and boy was I disappointed."
1.0,Need a free return label for this item
1.0,"Fit doesn't match the photo - the dress is significantly longer (hits well below the knee, at mid-calf) and much looser than the photo suggests. Cheap fabric with weird seaming on the shoulders that make it look like it has shoulder pads. Overall, not cute.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'9"" and 130lbs and bought a size small."
1.0,"These were thin and plain and looked cheap, not a cable pattern, and certainly not very warm or attractive.  When I was able to reach the company I was offered an MRL requiring a 40 mile round trip to a mail drop. I offered to send by regular mail and met with disagreement.  They finally said just give away and said they would do a refund. I may have missed it, but I do not think I received any part of the cost. I gave them to Good Will and will order from a Vermont Source.  Thank you..Jean Parady"
1.0,Dress fit way too big. Returned product and still waiting on my refund.
1.0,Very cheap top that is so stiff and unflattering when put on. Save your money and pass on this one.
1.0,"This is horrible. It’s cheap and poorly made. The headband came already broken and Just poorly. I’m 5’10 165 lbs , lil busty and hippy<br />Forgot what size I ordered but I got the top on which needs more elastic and the pants didn’t fit they need more elastic as well."
1.0,Looks cheap!  Didn't wear.
1.0,"The description page said Medium control but when ordered it changed to Firm.  It was also a 1X, but it fit my Medium size Teen tightly.  This is not what I wanted!!  Notified Amazon to show the ad errors and got my money back upon return."
1.0,"When this item arrived, I didn't even have to put it on before knowing that it was far too big. When I did put it on, my observations were confirmed as I was swimming in extra fabric. I ordered the size that the sizing chart suggested...ended up being a waste of money."
1.0,small in the wrong places... large in the wrong places... large in waist... small around thighs....
1.0,Shirt was way too small. Second time having to return.
1.0,"The sizes run small, I got a 5-6 it fit like a 4t"
1.0,Ordered large but got extra small in a box labels large. Can not get the gloves on my hand. $30.00 wasted!
1.0,Beautiful but fades very quickly
1.0,These were supposed to be 8ga but clearly not! The picture doesn't do it any justice on how tiny they are. I didn't even open the pkg. I'm definitely returning these
1.0,The floppi slippers flopped off the back of my foot. Not because they were too big but rather very poorly designed. The heel of the slipper covered only half of my heel. Had to send them back
1.0,Design is not modern at all. It starts very thin then broadens at the end with prominent lines that make you look like grandpa.
1.0,Too small not as described
1.0,"This is how the shoes came, one of them was folded from the top made it difficult for my child to put her foot in. The shoe won’t stay up it has the dent. Contacted seller regarding this, no response."
1.0,The shirt isn't designed for a woman who has a shapely upper body. It’s not sweatshirt material.
1.0,Crap quality and came in the wrong size
1.0,Strap broke off after 3 uses. Disappointing that it is not reinforced.
1.0,The quality of these socks do not justify spending  $15 a pair. They are like something you find in a discount store because they look like they are defective.
1.0,Was disappointed with this bag.  It was extremely small.  It looked like it was for a child.
1.0,Cheaply made casting and bad painting.
1.0,Pídanlo una talla más grande q la suya porque corre pequeño
1.0,Extremely uncomfortable. Elastic doesn’t stay
1.0,"No me gustaron porque los lentes se salen de los cordoncitos, no son lo que pensé."
1.0,I not even tried this dress looks very cheap very cheap
1.0,"Cheap, Junk, was broke when it got here. Even cheaper looking in person."
1.0,Too small. Unable to use
1.0,It's not a good fit and does not hold properly
1.0,I ordered my regular size. It was huge. Definitely not youthful or flattering. It was like I was swimming in a pool of floral fabric. If you can get the right size the material is nice and the print is pretty. Was just disappointing on myself.
1.0,Wrong size had to return.
1.0,"Giving it 1star for the cute fondant look but not a good buy as it came damaged and feels<br />Cheap, doesn’t match the quality of crocs."
1.0,Too itchy
1.0,the key rings are very cheap light weight and bent very easily and do not hold up to normal use.  The machining/ casting is very poor fit and barely works.  Most of the key chains in the package pull apart without having to press the detente ball.  These are not the ones they used to make.  I do not recommend this manufacturer to anyone.
1.0,"I love the design of the hat but Amazon, I have one serious gripe. This is a US ARMY emblem item but inside it is labelled Made In China! Is it possible to have the manufacturer of US Military memorabilia actually make it in the US? Sorry, but it offends me as a Veteran."
1.0,One ripped the first day. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Half the shirt including the arms are half black and and plaid .I returned it ..
1.0,Take too long to get need to cancel
1.0,the dress make you look bigger than you are
1.0,Literally came apart when I took it out of the package.  Threw it right into garbage.
1.0,Pretty colors but if you are 200 with 40 ddd don't get these. Maybe if I was 170 with (36 ddd perky).
1.0,"Cute shoes, but the heel strap doesn't reach around the back of my foot. ( I have normal feet)  :)<br />I had to return these.  If the straps were just a few inches longer I would have kept them.  Easy fix if they'll notice this."
1.0,Wore one time and the seam came completely apart. Poor craftsmanship.
1.0,Save your money.  Actually makes me look bigger and extremely difficult to put on.
1.0,Loved it but the material was very bad and it ripped onluy with one wear.
1.0,"I am very disappointed that this hat looks a million times better in the pictures and in the description. What I received was a poor quality hat. It was way to big and ill fitting.The beige/tan colored, thin, flimsy fabric was bleached looking, just a very cheaply made hat. I have returned."
1.0,They are so big they will fall off constantly
1.0,The stitching was coming loose at the seam and the stripes at the seam were not even. Very big and sloppy fitting. Would not recommend this style.
1.0,"Three years ago I bought a pair of these (I went back and found the order in my history to re-order). The first ones had a longer ""tail"" end that would slide into the open tube - they were hard to get on, but I wore them without taking them off for the whole three years with no problems. They had finally gotten misshapen - one was flat on one side, and they broke in half when I unbent them to take them out. Those were 5 stars.<br />No problem - I'll just reorder. These are no where near the same. The one end is sharp and very short. They were even harder to get aligned compared to the others, but it would have been worth it if they were okay. I don't know what these were made of, but I had to take them out within a half hour because my ears had gotten swollen and itchy. A day later the hole is still itchy. Yes, I cleaned them before putting them in - it's the ""metal"". I threw them away and would give them zero if I could. Too bad, because previous order was amazing."
1.0,Looks very vintage online but it's actually BRIGHT BRIGHT yellow!!! Not faded yellow as it looks. It's awesome that its so inexpensive but it just doesn't look anything like the picture shown. It looks like something you might win at a fair sadly. But either way it would be great for a preteen. Just not what I had in mind when I bought it for myself.
1.0,"Product works well but didn't last a year as the band tore at one of the clasps holes. I  still bought another one and figured I would see if the warranty worked, it does not. I tried to contact the company through Amazon and their website and didn't get a response.<br /><br />Update: 020419 Bought a replacement one in October 18 and it broke today (Feb 19). Not worth it."
1.0,doesn't fit as advertised.  very uncomfortable. dealing with returns a nightmare.  Surprised Amazon supports selling this product.
1.0,"This was the first item off Amazon that I bought that did not turn out good, that watch link, I had brought to a watch repair and him install and took out 1 link and of course I used 1 time and it fell off my wrist and then this watch became useless to me, I would purchase a watch that was made this poorly again, I buy on Amazon quite a bit and this is the first bad experience"
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture very disappointed that I didn’t get to return in time due to being ill.
1.0,I honestly wouldn't wear this as a mask. The material is so thin. This would best be used as a rash guard when on a boat to protect your neck from a sunburn.
1.0,The worst pair of pants I've ever received by far..not just a second..more like found in dumpster
1.0,"This was nothing like the photo. Said it was warm, but when I held up the hoodie, I could see daylight through it, and that was double thickness of material. It was that thin. Sending it back. Not pleaded at all. It looked so cute in the pic. Really disappointed."
1.0,"Site said available, I ordered in May and every update is pushed further and further in the future. Amazon should be ashamed! they claim NO fault in last or poor quality and refunds are the buyers responsibility.  someone is getting paid and the buyer the shaft!"
1.0,"Sizing incorrect, runs small. Very sheer."
1.0,"very disappointed very I wanted the white and blue, or the white and black tippy top, not this top, this was not<br />what I wanted period, I can't believe Amazon make these kinds of mistakes. very disappointed"
1.0,One was good did not seem to have flaus one had three rings around it from the middle to the base. Spouse did not like the bad one almost not worth sending it back or complaining
1.0,Why does it smell like smoke and chemicals? Really disgusting
1.0,I should’ve known since the price was so low. You get what you pay for
1.0,No good! The earrings literally started to tarnish immediately. Not even worth the $8
1.0,"These are so stiff and uncomfortable I cannot use them.  Very disappointed.  There is zero give when putting them on, which makes it nearly impossible to get them on."
1.0,2 out of the three pairs were fine....1 pair....you could not even put your foot thru...so this was really disappointing ...especially given as a gift
1.0,Muy grande y muy delgada
1.0,The zipper on both of these sports bras broke- black one broke on first use purple broke on 4th use. Total waste of money due to uselessness
1.0,"Great concept unfortunately it doesn’t work as it said it would. Not that it’s broken, it just doesn’t brush your hair into straightness as it claims."
1.0,"Very disappointed in this item. I ordered a size medium.  I’m 5’ 9” and 145lbs. Size 34 C bra. The thongs fit my size 6/8 frame great.  The bra on the other hand could have fit size DD breasts perfectly.  What was the maker thinking in the sizing difference. Also, the garter belt clasps are rubber and I was sweating 20 minutes later trying to get them to hook to the thigh highs I purchased separately, finally giving up and removing it all.  I have purchased a lot of lingerie on amazon and have had a great experience with the quality of items, but this was a fail!"
1.0,Nowhere on the ad does it say it's zoomed in like 100000%
1.0,To snug for a large
1.0,The fit is completely off.  The waist seems to be for super tall people.  Or just printed and sewn wrong.
1.0,The balls fall off eaay
1.0,After constantly wearing turned copper color
1.0,Do not buy the metal is so thin a two-year-old could bend it it’s very junky and poorly made it’s not worth a dime save your money
1.0,NOTHING IS GOOD WET FROM RAIN.
1.0,"The clasp that held the leather pieces together was sharp and the paint was flaking off.<br />It was cute, but not very well made."
1.0,"I entered in the search area for ""clothing for women made in USA"" and this popped up and I thought this is great, good looking clothes, fair price. Then I detected it was made in China along with many other companies listed under my search terms that were made in China.  Come on Amazon, you mean to tell me there are no clothing companies in the USA that you could accurately sort thru to find my request?"
1.0,I got charged a fee for restocking the product when I returned the item.
1.0,Decent quality but runs very small
1.0,Very disappointed. I didn't pay much and I didn't get much. Very cheap and tacky.
1.0,You can tell its cheaply made. Won't hold it's shape.
1.0,"This is NOT AT ALL what I expected... The pants were see-through and did not even have a helm at the bottom... I order this for my son on Easter Sunday and this turned out to be a disaster! I ended up leaving him home because I didn't have time to find anything else and for this price, I didn't think there would be too many, if any at all problems with it... I AM HIGHLY DISSATISFIED and will be sending these back."
1.0,"THE WHITE IS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. Not silly, now cowl, no nothing. It was see-through, it was a papermache material. It looked like a large handkerchief. This is coming from an Amazon shopper people. It was awful! Returned."
1.0,looked like a Halloween costume. cheap
1.0,The buckle for the belt was so weak that with just a simple tug it comes undone.  It would be so easy for someone to tear it off of me.
1.0,"This was advertised as fitting any head, even extra-large heads. I know I have a larger than average head. It does not reach around enough to cover both my ears. I was very disappointed."
1.0,so tiny and made of the cheapest material
1.0,Soft but uneven cut. Doesn't close at the bottom & way too big on the top.
1.0,"Horrible... cheap looking too thin, but still manages to look bulky while you’re wearing it. Hood is non functional. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and is still too small."
1.0,The first one used broke on day one when trying to remove it from my nose.
1.0,Cheeeeeeaaaap. Made with tiny screws. Don't waste your money
1.0,Order 2 time same pants and got different size and color ! :(
1.0,Very low quality you must not know leather to like  this jacket. It's color goes away once touches water.<br />Want to return it.
1.0,Its not real.  Will turn on your wrist.  Its ok as costume but it is not advertised as costume and I don't wear costume so I am very dissatisfied.
1.0,Had to return it. I did not like the fabric and design.
1.0,This is completely see through even though it says it’s not. It’s very cheaply made as well.
1.0,"I have a few complaints about this product.  I'll start out by saying, this product may not have been made for me.  I have relatively smaller wrists and probably about average sized hands for a man.  I did have to stretch the band over my hand and onto my wrist.  Once it was on my wrist, the band felt fine.  After about four times of doing this, one of the anchors in the band (the metal pieces that connect to the watch) ripped out.  I'll also add, i wasn't too impressed with how the band connected to the watch its self.  It didn't sit as flush or as neatly as the Apple branded watch bands do.  I was willing to look past that minor flaw if it wasn't for the band ripping on me."
1.0,"I'm pretty thicc as one would say but not enough to ruin how other tights like these ones are supposed to look... that was not the case the markings are all off and don't align at all not to mention that they are printed way too big in the first place? To some it all up, these are not worth the price at all and just make your legs look like they have grey blobs on your thighs and ankles, but the fish net thigh high it come with are nice lol"
1.0,"This top is a circle of material folded in half with a neck hole and two seams that creates arm holes.  It has no shape and wears like a sack.  The top shipped in a bag about the size of a quart baggie; so, it was terribly wrinkled when I took it out of the packaging.  It was returned."
1.0,These are not very well made. The zipper on the first time trying came apart. If I wasn't leaving in a free days I would return them and order different ones.
1.0,"This slipper started falling apart in the first few weeks. They are now, after 2 months, completely unwearable."
1.0,I bought in the summer 0f 2013 wore them a little bit in the winter and this winter wore them 4 times and the seams on top all around the toe all came loose just separated almost like the material was  dry rotted. I  feel this should not have happen and would like an explanation from Tamarac if this is a fluke or what is wrong here for I am Leary of buying anything from them again.
1.0,"If you have sensitive skin this is not for you. These rings are very low quality; the first day I received the rings a rim out of the heart ring feel out, the other was way to heavy & I thought I least I had the daisy.. well a month later the Daisy’s has broke out my skin so bad that I can’t wear any. Guys do not buy this if you want good quality.. although the product is cheap it’s not worth it"
1.0,"Product looks good but beware of the quality.  Tried to install the road bike cleats and the bolts fit into one shoe but not the other.  This is a standard size bolt supplied with the cleat that fit all road bike shoes and are not specific to this brand.  I am amazed that they will fit one shoe and not the other. It turns out that the cleat bolt inserts were not installed on the shoes they will not fit.  That is the kind of quality you get when buying these shoes.  Unfortunately, I did not try to install cleats when I first bought them and now they are past the return date so I just wasted $60 and have a worthless pair of shoes that do not work.  DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY on these shoes.  Extremely poor quality."
1.0,"This is a well made and very stylish dress. The material it's constructed with felt luxe to the touch and was substantial. The problem is, sizing. I normally wear a 14/16 in a dress so I ordered up. An 18/20 or, xxl was woefully small on me. I could get into it but, I couldn't have worn it comfortably for any length of time."
1.0,"I want to talk about my experience with this product. I will start with everything came in good condition and as described. I have all the tools that are needed to open watches and change straps, so I opened my Casio original strap with no issues at all when I started to work on this adapter it just so hard and wouldn't fit on I tried even the included spring bars with no luck, when I began to add force to make it fit I managed after one hour of trying to make fit and when I finished the final result was a bend spring bar which is ok, I don't mind as long as it will fit, so I added the strap, and when I wore the watch, it was awful it's not flexible at all the adapter are directed in one position which make it unusable and not comfortable at all, after all of this long process my watch was damaged and scratched due the installation process, and it's just not worth it, I removed it and changed it to the original strap which is much better to install and more comfortable."
1.0,"The good:<br />- Perfect fit for Garmin Vivoactive HR<br />- Classy looking band takes the Vivoactive HR out of the gym and into the office!<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Tool to adjust band is cheap metal and broke while adjusting the band<br />- Watch band clasp broke after one week.<br />- Mystery metal content - even though the Vivoactive is waterproof, I wasn't comfortable wearing this band in the shower or the pool.<br /><br />I'd recommend upgrading the Vivoactive HR band to something classy - but not this product. The tools are cheap, and so is the band's hardware. A little piece inside the clasp quit after a week of light use. I only took off the watch to shower, so the clasp and band were not undergoing significant stress or use.<br /><br />I'm back with a silicone band now, and looking for a higher quality metal band that will take me from the gym to the office."
1.0,"This was a little hard to put on but extra hard to take off. When following the instructions I couldn’t remove the face cover. I’d to break it to remove it. A waste of money and it’s just hard plastic. Not as described by seller, cheaply made, and it will fade fast."
1.0,They do not do what was said they will do.  I see worst with them on.  They are a waste if money for real.<br /><br />Sorry I must tell the truth.
1.0,Dislike it. This is the ugliest shirt I’ve ever ordered off of Amazon I would never wear it it’s awful do not order
1.0,Does not connect to Gear. Will not snap in to device.
1.0,"I ordered the 3XL based on my size  1) I bulged out of the sides 2) sagged like a sleeping bra.  Additionally, I could immediately smell that same horrible &#34;gassing off&#34; smell from petroleum products - like a cheap shoe store/shoe section at Walmart or many of the bathroom shower curtains or non-slip tub mats.  I tried on one carefully, but it had a noticeable black smudge on it and  the pads in the cup liners shifted around easily. There is also NO WAY to adjust the traps.  Otherwise, the bright colors were pretty and it was somewhat soft. I was hoping these would give relieve to my aching shoulders and my shoulder bra dents, but sending them back. Yuck."
1.0,"Super thin, cheap fabric. Provides zero wind or sun protection. Would not recommend."
1.0,"These were wayyyy too small and they broke almost instantly. I was refunded, luckily, but don't make the mistake I made."
1.0,Bought a pair a year ago and really liked them. Tried to re-order sent the wrong ones twice.
1.0,Soooooo cheap! The metal changed colors and they both broke within a week. So disappointed.
1.0,The watch was defective.  It lost time.
1.0,This product runs super small!!<br />Bra size 38C looks like a 32A
1.0,"I buy a sweatshirt for warmth. This is a very thin sweatshirt and not warm at all. It won't last long, so I'm sending it back."
1.0,"This belt is in no way tan. And the color definitely doesn’t match the photo used in the listing. Beyond that, the sizing as described is totally incorrect. I ordered as described and I can’t even get the first hole latched. Will definitely be sending this back."
1.0,Seemed generic.  Not cool wicking material don’t waste your money
1.0,Trash. Colors don’t look like picture and very low quality. Feels cheap and the loop part ripped after trying on the first time. Not even worth taking the time to return but don’t waste your money.
1.0,I have used similar products with great success and lots of compliments. Was looking forward to this being part of my Mardi Gras costume.  The plastic was very hard to get off off back and kept coming off front. It was a disaster and I opted for make up.
1.0,$32 dollars for ANY hat is ridiculous no matter what's on it.  I thought you were supposed to find good deals on the internet not get ripped off......
1.0,I love the the shirt and all the beautiful details on the shirt from what the picture shows I have not seen the shirt in person because I didn’t receive this order and it was supposed to be a gift for someone! I had to get another shirt that wasn’t the same I was disappointed! I really wanted to see this shirt on the person I was going to give it too!!😔😔
1.0,"Fit well if you buy bigger size, but the strap was not sewn completely, so I have to bring it to a seamstress for repair."
1.0,Way too small and my neck is not abnormally large.
1.0,"I was excited to try this product in Hope's to avoid buying a new bra. However, there is metal on both sides which digs into your skin. I literally had to unlatch my bra at an event due to the uncomfortableness."
1.0,the large is huge. Had to give ut to my plus size friend
1.0,The color was so off when I purchased the rose gold. I had to return it because it didn't match my rose gold watch at all.
1.0,"Fit was okay around waist, but way too high in the crotch. It’s a recipe for serious🐪 toe. They were unwearable."
1.0,"The center strap won't lay in anything but an awkward looking way under one of the side straps. It also does have an odor that's not great. But, since one of the straps came out of the clasp, I can't wear it. Not returning, for the money it's not worth it."
1.0,They aren’t true to size.
1.0,The velcro strap came off after only 1 week & then the laces broke off after 2 weeks.
1.0,"Love the top, but I received the wrong size :("
1.0,These are super itchy and leave color on my hands and clothes and body. The top of the waistband is so tight and the rest of it is not tummy control. No matter how you position them they give you camel toe. These awkwardly dig into my rib cage. They make me feel like a busted can of biscuits. Must have changed the product if these crappy leggings are getting five stars. I’m 5’2 and 100 lbs and got a medium and they are too short. Creating a spare tire that I don’t have. They stretch out too. Wicked annoying because can’t return.
1.0,returning.  only had blue mirror reflection on front of lens not blue lenses....
1.0,"In my opinion, it just looked and felt really weak and flimsy"
1.0,I ordered an X-Large and they were way to small
1.0,No son correctas las tallas la. M es. Como XS
1.0,"They fell apart the first time wearing each pair, the tassel part came undone. So sad considering I received so many compliments."
1.0,Bracelet broke after a week of wearing it.
1.0,"These don't really fit as expected. Of the 6 pairs, 4 fit nicely, and 2 are two sizes too small. For how cheaply these are made, the price is WAY too high."
1.0,Had issues ever since it arrived opening the zipper and now it has become worse.  Definitely defective from the manufacturer.
1.0,"I really like this, quality material.  I am going to recommend and buy another one.  So please with it.  So heavy and warm.<br /><br />After using this jacket for a week, Washed once, I noticed the stitch was loose around the cuff.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"Never got to use this, the band was way to big and never could get it adjusted, the watch place in town couldn't even get it. Others talked about a tool to help and I didnt get a tool, the whole thing was such a disappointment and waste of time and money"
1.0,Weird cut in the arms.
1.0,"Horrible fabric. Even with washing there were permanent crease lines. Cheaply made, poor quality. Should’ve returned but difficult to do while on vacation so I just pitched it."
1.0,"When I removed the jacket from the plastic, it was SO WRINKLED and had a lot of lint on it. It also was much larger than expected and looked terrible on me. Obviously this was returned by someone else and no one checked to see the condition. DISAPPOINTED and returned it!"
1.0,"I am, by no means, a large headed man, but these glasses are smaller than the reference picture… or the guy wearing them must be microcephalic."
1.0,Clasp fell apart.
1.0,Junk. Arrived black and nasty
1.0,Company tried to give partial credit and keep product which does not fit. Cheap stuff.
1.0,"the pictures make them look like good quality product - not so, very &quot;cheap&quot; material grade and lace whimpy, not sized correctly either. Bought size  I have always worn, not remotely close to fitting - about 2 sizes too small"
1.0,The fit was all wrong in the hips with this short. I had to send them back!
1.0,"Returned, too thin for my needs, I was looking for a warm fleece.  Suppose it would be great for others.  I returned it."
1.0,No he recibido mi pedido por lo que exijo me devuelvan mi dinero urgente
1.0,If this watch gets wet it'll never work again.
1.0,"I think the earrings are decent for the price. They are not shinny, they are cloudy, however they do not have visible flaws. Overall, I like them. I emailed amazon a week ago letting them know that when the earrings arrived and I tried them on, the back of the earrings was extremely loose. He didn't respond to me with any advice or help. I wore the earrings to dinner ONCE and lost one of them. I contacted the seller to see what we can work out so that I have two pairs of earrings-NOREPLY! I am willing to work out something."
1.0,"There is a strong odor of petroleum or something that stinks, it did not wash out. The cut of these leggings are for thin shapes not for those with a fuller body shape. With that said the seams in the crouch end up too far back in the rear and shows if you wear a shorter blouse. Material is thin and see thru. I was consistently pulling them up because they kept galling down."
1.0,"hello, I am 5.81/2"" and I weigh approximately 127lbs....DO NOT BUY if yer like me, tall....from the photo, I only purchased them because i thought that they would fit like ""harems""?....also I'm SCARED to wash them, shrinkage??🤔😬...if they do, I will donate them, reluctantly 😐😷🙄......cheaply made, sorry I have to warn consumer"
1.0,The dress was definitely not sized correctly. I gave it to my teenage daughter.
1.0,"Wish I would have taken a picture. But I threw it straight in the trash. Instead of this nice dark red it came bright red. Whatever, i tried it on, fabric seemed ok enough for a work shirt, it’s intended use. One sleeve was longer and had a button up cuff, while the other did not. What a huge disappointment to pay for a shirt that was so defective it wasn’t even wearable.  I should have returned it but I hate the hassle. It’s in the landfill now."
1.0,When I open the package the necklace was broken in two places
1.0,"Way to small, cheap material"
1.0,"Nearly impossible to see the writing on the ring. The lettering isn’t in black, but in a silvery/translucent color. The writing also doesn’t look like the ring in the film but looks very poorly done. Ring is very cheap feeling. Will be sending back immediately."
1.0,"The structure fit fine with a little extra room, but the middle up fit way too loose and looks very strange. I can push on it and have plenty of space before I reach my chest. Very disappointed in myself as well as my purchase."
1.0,Not into Brony culture
1.0,"The diameter is thick- did Not fit in the connect bar - unable to send back- package is open (how else will you know if it fits?)  Know your dimensions before buying or you wasting money! These are made for Their bands,"
1.0,"I was disappointed to see how cheap the clothing feels.  It has this weird spandex feel to them.  I was also surprised that the other half of the shirt and pants were a BRIGHT BLUE instead of a grey (As I thought).  You should really put BOTH colors on the description, so people can distinguish the difference. I bought a large which fit really awkward on me. I bought cheaper two sets for better quality."
1.0,"I am 5.3, 156 lbs. I have been wearing medium to large sweaters. I ordered a large in this. Its not! Terrible fit. I could hardly get my arms through the sleeves. It is also not as long as shown in the picture."
1.0,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews instead of being caught up in how beautiful the design was. Don't know if the metal is truly surgical stainless steel or if the golden coating has something in it, but I'm allergic to this belly button ring."
1.0,Look great price..... oh they cancel figures.
1.0,I don’t like that brand name is SHEIN<br />If I wanted to get something from that company. I would of done it straight to them.<br />Top is wide Like an xl  and bottom is to tight to be a L<br />Not satisfied. Looks and feels cheap not !
1.0,"Warning.  Do not buy this item, it’s not comfortable to Breathe in, you get real hot."
1.0,Did not like the item because of poor quality and too small.
1.0,Too short for the Royal Luggage Tags.
1.0,I don't remember ordering or receiving this item
1.0,"I am editing my review. Today I wore these for only the second time since I got them, and while grocery shopping my earring fell on the floor. The post had broken off. I hadn’t even touched it. They are really cute, and I really wish they would have lasted longer, but not well made at all."
1.0,"Ordered a large. I guess they thought eye patch. I am a d cup. The size around was fine, but the cup size was an A or B cup. Not gonna work for what I got"
1.0,Broke the first day I wore it :(
1.0,"I received the purple and black pair. The purple in the photo looks the same, but when I received the bracelets, the purple in the heart is a different shade, a lighter shade, compared to the purple of the actual bracelet. It doesn’t match right."
1.0,The stones fell out of all of the studs within a week!!! Do NOT buy!!
1.0,Too tight in chest relative to size of dress
1.0,"Do not buy this item. It runs very small, and you have to pay overseas shipping to return.<br />The return it costs almost as much to buy."
1.0,"Terribly made, do not buy!<br />The fringe section of the earing was so poorly glued on that it would stick out in all different directions and on 2 of the pairs just fall right off!"
1.0,"The ring was pretty but felt thin. I was ok with that, but then within 2 days of having the ring, it turned black and green. This is, at best, very low quality silver. Buyer beware."
1.0,Product arrived from China sloppy wet in the bag and was too big.  No returns accept
1.0,Didn’t fit at all made for a little girl. Thought they were for women not even close. Not going to order again. Deceiving
1.0,"The easiest way to put it, these are ugly. so not flattering. waste of money."
1.0,"Unfortunately, it runs way too small<br />I’m 5’5 proportional 128lb<br />The pants hardly come up my tights and smash my butt. Looks really nice unflattering!<br />The top is wearable but, the fabric is super hot... not soft at all....<br />The color is very cute!<br />Now I missed the return window and there’s no way to contact the seller): 👎🏾"
1.0,"My daughter is a toddler 8, I ordered a toddler 8. They are three to four sizes too big and she will not be able to wear them with her Belle costume for Halloween. Very dissatisfied."
1.0,I would have given a Zero star review but that's not a option.  Very thin cheap material and fits my 6 yr old huge
1.0,The case looks used wasn’t to happy with the case..
1.0,I'm only a large and I ordered Xxl and was still too small. I suggest you get few sizes up.
1.0,This shirt is tiny...better order 4 sizes bigger than normal
1.0,"The fit is terrible, breast padding is way to low and the neck is so high it chokes.<br />The color is not at all as it looks in picture.<br />The return cost far exceeds the price of the dress. Very dissatisfied!"
1.0,Too short. Not for women with a longer waist
1.0,Wish Thai could have worked for us. This outfit was super cute but WAY smaller than 12-18 months. I ordered 12-18 months for my 13 month old daughter. She’s on the shorter side but this romper was super short on her arms and legs.
1.0,cute but way too small and large is a small.
1.0,"shoddy workmanship, I could not give this as a gift."
1.0,"It's not as shown on picture, the quality is bad, the black and the gray looks so similar and I recieved my package open."
1.0,I was really disappointed in this shirt. The fabric isn't what I expected nor the colors. The sleeves are too short and the cuffs too tight. I really dislike the overall fit. I would not recommend it.
1.0,"I ordered a small.  Not sure how it was a small, three of me could have fit in it.  The material is very cheap looking, has that shiny look to it.  Overall not impressed at all with this dress.  It is going back.<br />I am 5'3.5"" & 128lb for reference."
1.0,Never received it. After very long (weeks) time the seller told me they do not have them again after I had to make contact.
1.0,It broke since the first day
1.0,I wanted the dress to have a blouson structure as shown in the photo.  It did not.  It fit straight against my back.  It was not flattering
1.0,"The sleeves do not look anything like the picture. It’s a very small piece of fabric, maybe 2 inches, that falls at the elbow not anything like the photo. I ordered another dress and am hoping it gets here in time for my event so I can send this one back."
1.0,this product fit but the converse were fake bc the circle with the print smeared everywhere all over my shoe and i never washed it. never buying shoes off of amazon ever and i dont recommend it.
1.0,"This is our replacement.  Broke after wearing for 2 hours. The first one we got 2 days ago broke similarly and thought it was a fluke and they sent another right out.  Do not purchase, it’s a defective design i believe."
1.0,"Too long, definitely for y’all woman"
1.0,"Really disappointed. It doesn’t look like the picture. Very bad quality. Very small, more<br />Like a top than a dress. Terrible!"
1.0,"After one wear, toggle broke.  Very disappointing"
1.0,Smaller than expected according to size chart.
1.0,The sweater was smaller than I thought it would be. It almost doesn’t fit even though I ordered it a size to big.
1.0,Same shape but made out of what feels like cheap felt.
1.0,Took less than a year will not go
1.0,What a mess
1.0,I ordered XL and label marked XL but jacket size is XXL small. I had to give away rather than sending back to China. As far as quality goes what you pay what you get quality. I wouldn't recommend.
1.0,Nice color. Bad fit
1.0,I have had multiple surgeries and I have some fluid in areas. The material is comfy it does fit and I'm tall and atm not so skinny everywhere. My belly is bloated and some of my back. It does stick to it a bit but hey its comfortable and u can use it for a hanging shirt or out with legging.. I also have it in white. Do NOT dry them... Number 2.. Wore it twice after I wrote original review.. It ended up wider than longer how it stretched out. Tried to fix putting it in the dryer somehow to at least use as a shirt.. It shrunk so small and so out of shape .. I loved this cover up.. So disappointed now
1.0,"I gave the jackets to my daughter, too small.👎"
1.0,I had the opposite problem than the last review. It was way too big for an ankle bracelet. When I wear it with converse it just gets lost in the shoe and isn't visible. The quality is also a problem. The metal links have broken.
1.0,"They are super cute. BUT.... So uncomfortable!!! Within maybe 30 minutes I had blisters on the top of my feet.  I had to go the rest of the day at work with no shoes.  They actually bruised my feet, I couldn't wear closed shoes for 3 days until my feet healed.😕"
1.0,The dress was all wrinkled and terrible material.
1.0,Really check the sizing - I got XLarge and it fit like it was a small
1.0,"I bought it to match a pair of pink heels I have and the style is off.  It's boxy and the sizing is not so accurate.  It's a BLEH 😒 jumpsuit for me.<br /><br />Oh, the fabric is a kind of shiny material but not sure if it's breathable."
1.0,They were to thin.
1.0,It said that it would fit my Samsung watch but it didn't
1.0,I stopped using since it itches.
1.0,This thing looked like an extra small instead of a medium. Size up.
1.0,Color fine after some days. Not for regular wear.<br />Don’t buy
1.0,"Horrible buy. Maybe if I was 12 years old, it might fit. It's see through also. Throwing it out"
1.0,The symbol looks nice but as many others said little bit to big not only that but some of the pockets seemed to be glued to small so i had to peel them alittle which honestly shows its pretty cheap and not gonna last. The card pockets are to deep for the first 2 card slots which hide the cards making it a pain in the ass to grab because i had to pretty much jam my cards into the slots. This wallet is becoming a ornament nothing much because for normal life use its pretty bad.
1.0,I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  When you order this for your daughter it will say son on the necklace.
1.0,"I ordered a size 32, but those shorts look like a 23."
1.0,"Case is sharp, almost cut my finger trying to wind.<br />Dial is crocked and looks terrible....<br />Hard to wind due to the case sharpness.<br />3rd class China made watch.<br />No quality what so ever. *DO NOT RECOMMEND*<br />OBS: Pictures are displayed to show the facts."
1.0,I went by the size chart according to my size and they were way too small!!!
1.0,It's not good.
1.0,Very rough material. Did not fit correctly.
1.0,Product lost in mail getting a refund
1.0,"The colors are muddy and gross, the metal is very light weight and flexible, could break if you wanted to wear them.  Just ugly.  I was excited about the photos I saw but these are very cheaply made and trash."
1.0,supposed to be grey but they are PURPLE!
1.0,Not only did it arrive days after it was needed it was too big and it has a ripped and cuts on it so I can honestly don't know what to do with it
1.0,This item runs really small.
1.0,"These look like very nice socks as far as the material, etc goes.  The problem is that the Easy on and Easy off phrase does not work when you have very limited movement.  Even the directions do not work when you can not bend over very well and have to use two hands.  Probably an unfair evaluation since it is due to my mobility."
1.0,Didn’t last one day.  Broke in two
1.0,"When I receive the dress I was on my way to the graduation where I was wearing the dress to, so when I went into the restroom to change my clothes the dress had big holes in it then not to mention the word on the dress was supposed to say Vancouver well the R was missing off the dress... soooo p!ssed!"
1.0,"Ring turned black, it's not real sterling silver"
1.0,Hunk of junk- figured id try them for the cheapo price last summer and honestly really just opened packages and went UMMMM YUPPERZ...my assumptions were correct. Cheap is cheap regardless of how you look at it lol
1.0,"One of these fell apart the first day warn!! Largest piece just fell to the floor! I was looking forward to wearing these because they are lightweight and comfortable, but am extremely disappointed."
1.0,"Sized up and top was way too small. The sleeves were very narrow. I very between Large and extra large, I would need this in a 3X or larger."
1.0,Not true to size. Looks better in picture then in person. Cheap quality and arms do not flow well with the overall shirt.
1.0,Ran small and when I reordered fit well but strap broke when putting it on.
1.0,Don’t waste your money.  Ripped the seam just trying to cut the tag off.  Of course I removed the tag prior to trying this pitiful mess on.
1.0,"Absolutely worthless if you need to actually absorb sweat. These have an extremely open weave. We'll be trashing the whole pack. Also, it took weeks to receive them, even though during checkout it says normal shipping. They're shipped from China. Not well made at all. Not sure how the reviews are so high."
1.0,"These are the most flimsy, poorly constructed sunglasses I've ever seen. Yo would be better off just picking up a pair at a gas station."
1.0,Poor quality. My leggings were made with end fabric and had a white streak down the inseam.
1.0,Too bulky and cheap looking
1.0,Is this for real? Just opened them out of the box and they are dirty. Not just a little dirty but obviously worn. Gross.
1.0,Ordered a size 11 kid in Rose and received a size 12 in black and white. Don't want to send back right now during the pandemic and felt bad even having to have something delivered but my kiddo needed shoes.  They were cheap though. Will save them for when they fit.
1.0,"i did not like it ,very loor quality and doesnt worth to pay that amount it is cheap product ,$1"
1.0,"The watch is broke. I replace the battery and still no luck. I don't have time to return it, I was going to be a gift for my daughter."
1.0,Clothing has mold on it
1.0,Size was not accurate….Off by 2 sizes…Too Small.<br />But it’s quality seemed good and it’s really cute!
1.0,The material was cheap and didn't fit well for my full figure.
1.0,Product is sized much smaller than the standard &#34;XXXL&#34;.
1.0,"The neck is twice normal size.  I would have returned it, but had already washed it."
1.0,Cheap!! The studs that go through you ear were completely bent and when i tried to fix them they broke right off! Don't waste your money
1.0,For larger frame
1.0,The snap broke apart the first time I used it.
1.0,It is see through. I can't even wear it.
1.0,It was broke my husband have to fix it
1.0,I wouldn't purchase this. The gap hurts so bad when it goes into your piercing hole area.
1.0,The horn was off to one side rather than the middle and it looked crooked when she put the headband on due to the offset horn.
1.0,"I ordered an XL because I'm 5'10"" so most dresses barely cover my butt. I'm also a size 14 at the waist but a medium around the bust so most larges fit me super well without being too tight or baggy. But this dress was basically a body con on me. It's super tight which is annoying because it's supposed to be looser and once again it barely covers my butt"
1.0,As soon as we opened the package we saw that the clamp was broken. We can not use this item. What do I di  now.???
1.0,"I bought it one extra up size and it still too small. Material is feel and looks like I bought it from Dollars store. I bought is for gift for my daughter as a gift but I had to return it, it was that bad."
1.0,This dress fits like a graduation gown. Unflattering cut.
1.0,stoped working after 3 uses
1.0,"The hemlines rip easily. Fabric is too thin to support the stitching. Save your money, buy a regular cloth face mask elsewhere."
1.0,"I really really wanted to like the shirt. It was very cute and soft but as soon as I pulled it out of the packaging, an awful chemical smell hit me. I washed  it a couple of times, hoping it would take it out, but it never did. I decided to soak it in hot water and an odor remover soap, and the picture is the result after soaking it twice! I’ll be throwing this away as I don’t want this touching my body."
1.0,"I noticed the odor as soon as I opened the packaging. P. U. This purse stinks. Am ready to return it ASAP. Maybe it's just the burgundy color that smells so terribly. HELP. I actually LIKED the pictures of this purse but the smell, I can't stand it nor will I keep it."
1.0,This sweater is orange not brown. It doesn’t even match the photo or color description. Very disappointed.
1.0,Poor sizing.
1.0,"What I received is Amsell DF-850-XL viny gloves (1000) ""MicroFlex Derma Free"" not what is described or pictured. Carton and individual boxes are black, not blue, and labeling does not match what is pictured or described.<br /><br />This means that the product reviews I read before buying probably do not reflect the product I was shipped.<br /><br />Misleading advertising, product description, and likely product reviews I read are not for the product I received.<br />Edited: I returned them. The Extra Large sixe of what I received was substantially smaller than extra large size of other vinyl gloves."
1.0,Order for my 13 yr old she's about a size 13 jrs n it's tight so I decided a women's size would b great and lose on her to make her happy. She likes tomboy like dressing.
1.0,The shirt itself is fine but the image on the front is blurry and pixelated. It looks like a picture of a picture or a low resolution scan. Returned.
1.0,"This dress came in, in a different color and was small to fit. Make sure to get a size bigger in it."
1.0,It’s ok. Very pointed hood and wide shortish sleeves that you can’t role up. I am totally disappointed. The color is very light and gets dirty so fast also.
1.0,when I bought this i bought it in 2 sizes too big and it still didn't fit.
1.0,"This is my first return ever and it's because the material is described as 100% cotton which is one of the few materials I can wear.  It's a cotton/polyester blend 65/35 so it's getting returned.  I can't even try it on because I get hives from polyester so I'm unsure of the fit.  It's a pretty blue.  I wish it was all cotton, I'd rather keep it than return it."
1.0,There is no padding for your foot. Even if you wear heaving socks there is a large gap between the ankle and boot
1.0,I ordered a size up and it was still extremely small. I normally wear a medium and ordered a large. I will have to go up to an XL and even that will probably be right.
1.0,"The bracelet has nice color, but the jasper color has already chipped off one ceramic bead.  I will be returning it for a refund."
1.0,Cute but broke after just a few weeks.
1.0,"I ordered two for $46.90 in December 2016, I didn't like them because they were so cheaply made and you could just barely hear them when the pin was pulled so I mailed them back.  I have made &#34;five&#34; calls to them requesting my money back, final call was today is 4/6/17.  Every agent I spoke with prior to today told me I would received a refund by check.  Today, I was told they were not going to refund my money.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE, IT'S A BIG RIP OFF!!!  I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau, and anyone else who will listen!!!  I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered, it would have saved me a lot of headaches!"
1.0,Product looks get but within a couple of days the umbrella ripped. Also if there is any wind you can not use it. We are afraid to use it because of the rip and having it damaged more.
1.0,The material on this pantsuit was so cheap. I ordered white and it was so set through. There was no way I could wear it out in public. Returned immediately.
1.0,Ugly nothing like pictured. Would give 0 stars. Will never purchase any items from this company again! My dog has new chew toys!!
1.0,The jacket doesn't look like the picture. It is a very boring blue all over. There is no faded cool look to this jacket. It's the color of a farmers overall.
1.0,The would not even hold together to stay in my ears! I threw them away!!
1.0,"Totally agree with the other reviewers.  I would not recommend this hat for any use.  It's ridiculous looking, so cheap.  Wouldn't even put with a childs costume.  So glad it didn't cost much.  Honetely just throwing it away."
1.0,The dress was cute and fit well but it was sheer. Could be used as a cover up but needs a slip or something to wear as a normal dress
1.0,"Very fragile, it came in crooked, and broke after first use! Would not recommend. Style is nice but I will definitely not buy any cheap ones"
1.0,Earrings turned green and broke my wife's ear out.
1.0,My daughter don’t even weigh 90 pounds and a small was too small for her so I’m going to return it and get a larger size!!!!
1.0,Only got 1 and it was not as long as stated
1.0,Doesn’t match the size. The white is 1/2 and the black claimed to be 1/2 inch.
1.0,"I cannot express how much I hate these shorts. They’re nylon, so you can’t roll them up to make them look less like capris pants. There’s no back pockets, which is super irritating.  They waist runs large, AND it’s elastic (ew), so if you have your phone and keys in your pockets, they slide down your hips.  Again with the nylon, so you can’t roll the waist to compensate for the large size.  They’re thin...brush against a branch, and they’ll rip.  They suck on every level.  Absolutely hate them."
1.0,"It fell apart on the 2nd or 3rd day I wore it, very disappointing"
1.0,The charms are all breaking before even being able to insert them or while inserting. Can’t even clue on. I would not recommend.
1.0,One broke as soon as I tried to put it on. The post completely pulled off of the hoop just from taking the earring backing off to put it on. Very disappointed.
1.0,Absolutely horrible quality! They ripped within minutes of putting them on.
1.0,This item is toooooooo small.
1.0,The belt is too big for a size 32 waist.
1.0,Do not buy if you need any support for your arches or ankles. Neither slipper is marked left OR right.
1.0,"Really wanted to love these shoes. My daughter is size 11 (size 12 in gym shoe). We ordered 28, and when those didn’t fit, also ordered a 29. The 28 were too small and 29 were huge and the toe box was enormous. My daughter was super disappointed that they didn’t fit, but the cut is super weird and won’t work for us."
1.0,"Didn't try it on, its not even a real tee shirt,  its made like a cheap Halloween costume. If you buy one stay away from open flames! Graphics were terrible,  blurry."
1.0,I really did not like this item very lightweight
1.0,Sizing off. Didn't fit. Can't return for some reason?
1.0,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED. It's too small, the ""leather"" looks cheap, the G initial looks like a C, and huge detachable strap looks like it belongs to another purse. I will return it....."
1.0,"The earrings look absolutely ridiculous, like plastic. And feel even worse, my ears were irritated within minutes of trying them on. They look like when a friend becomes very bored and starts making jewelry and you feel bad for them so you buy something out of guilt and secretly hate the jewelry and start to resent the friend."
1.0,"1. I will never order anything that is not prime in the future.  So hard to return.  Such a bummer, this thing is HUGE and it just doesn't look quality.  I was very disappointed."
1.0,La verdad no es como se ve en la imagen y la tela es muy dura esperaba algo mejor pero lamentablemente no es como lo imagine
1.0,"Really cheap quality and uncomfortable for my toddler, disappointed. Looks much better in the picture."
1.0,This was very poor material and came as if it had been worn. I have returned this dress. If only this seller could change the material used this is a very beautiful style.
1.0,The brooch lacked the color that is in the picture.  Color is there around pearl but NO<br />color on petals.  The metal<br />is tarnished gold color.  I do not reccomend this product.
1.0,"A mediocre band. The leather looks very nice, but it's not very durable though. The buckle is VERY weird and cheap-looking. It all would make this band ok if not the part that attach to the Watch. They are so fragile and cheap-looking, and they don't fit properly into the Watch. You have to use some force to put them in and when they finally go in, they're VERY shaky and COMPLETELY NOT SECURE!! Really disappointed."
1.0,F-
1.0,"Not only did these come all crumpled up and deformed, they are almost 2 sizes too small and i SIZED UP! they barely zippered over tight leggings and no socks on. Absolutely not practical snow boots. And the quality is not there at all. They feel like they’re made out of cheap foam."
1.0,Sucks I waited for a shirt that wasn’t true size
1.0,Not comfortable returning soon
1.0,It is made of low-quality materials. Just plan to throw it away after a wash.
1.0,"Nothing you can do to make the dress look flattering. Super disappointed with make of the dress. Too big, even with a belt, the makes you look like Spongebob."
1.0,Not worth the money. Definitely returned it. I’m still waiting for my return credit.
1.0,"My daughter has worn these shoes for school only 3 days a week for about 3+ months, and they just fell apart.  The top portion disconnected from the sole.  Save your money."
1.0,Terrible quality. Thin and see through. Not worth the price
1.0,"The chest line goes across the middle of my bust instead of beneath as it should and the waist was looser than I anticipated. I adjusted for the chest by pulling it down which gave me indecent cleavage for a dinner out, so I layered with a tank top underneath."
1.0,"Although very pretty and make for great photos, these were only good for two wears. They snagged on themselves and rip when I had my legs completely together and the rhinestones started falling off within the very first wash."
1.0,Did not look like the pic. Too much material on the top. Looked odd when worn.
1.0,"These are definitely not made for women, unless yo have a big head!  They wouldn't even stay up on my nose.  Pretty glasses, but huge!  Returned"
1.0,Terribly too small their size for kids they don't expand they're super cheap do not buy
1.0,1 arrived broken
1.0,Not as described! Only a single prong on back. The pin used that was supposed to keep emblem on fell off when I opened the pkg. Would not stay attached. Disappointing!<br />Product is unusable and not what you think you are getting !
1.0,"I had previously posted a review with 3 stars due to the incorrect charm, now I am changing my review...<br />This broke the 2nd time I wore it."
1.0,"Don't buy this--the picture is a trick. The bottle is so tiny, barely enough to do one saddle. If you can buy a 32 ounce for $15, why would you buy a 8 ounce container for $10? I was tricked by the photo, thought it was the 32 ounce at a better price. Sending back to get the 32 ounce jug."
1.0,Cheap material and made… over sized by two sizes and would not accept return!
1.0,It changing color
1.0,I am 5.7 and it’s way too short for me…
1.0,The bottom letters are not correct. Not a real AKA item.
1.0,The whole stone to one of the earrings fell out.  Not happy at all. Tried to send back was told wasn't able to.
1.0,These broke (trying to clasp them in the back) literally as I was putting them on the first time and they went directly in the trash.  I do not recommend.
1.0,Someone already tried this on or it was already returned<br /><br />Nonetheless not a well made dress very cheap looking and looked better in the photos provided
1.0,"Do not purchase...... looks nothing like advertised.  the bucks is a purple color and is printed on the black, not like the picture at all and the first time I tried them on the elastic broke because it clearly wasn't sewn on properly..... not worth the money."
1.0,Broke the same day I got them and took 3 weeks
1.0,TOO small can not use can not return
1.0,"Sleeves are not as pictured, the shirt is wide but the sleeves are narrow. It is like they sewed two patterns together."
1.0,"The pictures online looked really cute however when I got it, it was a little too tight. I’m a true medium but it was tight around the bust area and the sleeves. The fabric was really stiff and uncomfortable. The color wasn’t as pink as I thought it would be. I was so disappointed because it looked so cute in the picture"
1.0,Didn’t fit my figure at all. Looks like a gunny sack. Shapeless and unflattering.
1.0,I purchased this item almost a yr ago and wore them maybe twice and put them on yesterday and the button came off. So quality is not 100% Very bummed out 😒
1.0,"Lovely design- ordered per size chart, yet cups were shaped oddly. The cups were to small at the base, and opened out quite widely at the top, so cup shaping was off. Since it doesn’t have a hook enclose, you have to stretch the bralette over your head. The base, flesh colored back ripped when I put it on over me head. There is no other way to put it on."
1.0,Umbrella won't stay up. Only used about five times before rain and crazy work schedules set in. Last opened at the end of May. Opened today and the handle rolls the umbrella up but then it starts unrolling by itself. Waste of money.
1.0,Already turned black. Will not be putting on my babygirl anymore.
1.0,"Can't give 0 stars. 100% Polyester, not really a sweatshirt, more like long sleeved under-armor. Incredibly small. Waste of money, waste of time. Will not buy from them again."
1.0,Yikes this  is so light it feels cheap and is probably worth two or three dollars.<br /> Came today I'm deciding whether or not I'm going to return it.
1.0,….So I sent them back! 😑
1.0,The arms near the pits are way too tight. You can’t lift up your arms.
1.0,"This is a super cute band, but it broke as soon as I put it on. The class was so weak! Do not trust this to secure your $500 watch!!"
1.0,"I ordered 2 sizes up,  because the reviews said it ran very small. I should have ordered an even bigger size, because I cannot wear it it's too small."
1.0,"Took me 10 minutes to untangle. Plus, it's soooo short. Definitely does not hang like the picture. Sending back."
1.0,I’m so bummed. I haven’t even worn this yet and the strap that holds the chin strap already broke!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:7ef28123b4ff886dc62accf0bf054449]] This backpack I bought because it stated could fit an iPad. I keep lip gloss my planner and iPad in this bad with my water bottle. I’ve had it for about 60 days and it broke. The straps need to be more durable.
1.0,It was very cheaply made and I sent it back. Nothing like what I was expecting.
1.0,"I used the sizing chart that the seller suggested: the one in the pictures. Going off of that, I ordered a large, since my measurements are 29” waist and 39” hips. This barely even had enough fabric to tie it, and certainly didn’t have enough fabric to tie it how it is pictured. Ok top of that, the fabric is *very* sheer. Completely disappointed in this purchase."
1.0,Came bent out of shape. Never regained correct shap. Cheap hat with a cheap sticker. I thought it was embroidery!
1.0,Two of the four claps were broken.  Very poor quality
1.0,"Fell apart, so did not work, NO value for your money!"
1.0,Black paint came off withing 10 min of wearing kt
1.0,Turned my arm colors poorly made and copper under a bad paint job and clasps are weak and makes the watch fall off.
1.0,"Garbage, used it for Halloween."
1.0,The shape of this shirt is off. Big on the top and narrow at the bottom. Arm holes were huge. Built for the Hulk.
1.0,"As a bigger women these are super comfy and fit every curve and lump, but they're so thin you could see through them."
1.0,"Ordered an X-Large, but fit like a large. Also the Care tag doesn't show what's stated in the description the tag says Wash separately professional dry clean recommended."
1.0,Good for the price. Don’t expect more. They are comfortable and look just like the picture. Nothing special but nothing disappointing. EDIT: Returning. The sole came right off!
1.0,doesnt come as advertised. there is no wide band at the top. its not the same material or fit as the pics
1.0,"Mechanically, they seem fine.  They fit my glasses just as I expected them to.<br /><br />They are advertised as &#34;polarized&#34;.  This means they should reduce reflected glare from all horizontal surfaces.<br />A simple lens-rotation test showed they don't reduce glare from any angle: they are NOT polarized.<br /><br />I returned them."
1.0,I didn't like these.  They felt tight on my head yet still came off when I slept. Just wasn't comfortable.
1.0,Unusable junk
1.0,I missing the belt and the material is not good
1.0,Hems are very uneven. Hangs like a sack. Very wrinkled and wrinkles DO NOT come out when washed and dried
1.0,"Loved the ribbed footing. But unfortunately, the material is not good quality at all. They are way too frail. Each pair only lasted once or twice wearing at the most."
1.0,This is for the little guy
1.0,Its awful! The material is an itchy polyster. And it has pleats across the back of the shirt that you can't see in product images. But I'm posting a picture of it...RETURNING THIS ITEM!
1.0,"When I opened the package by first thought was I was sent a silver band when I had ordered GOLD but the package was labeled “gold”. This band is not gold, it is close to being, maybe, a rose gold but the color is weirdly silverish. It does not match the gold on the Fitbit face. It was also difficult to understand the directions to remove some of the links. I spent almost an hour removing 2links. I’m not too happy with this band."
1.0,Not red at all.  More like a deep burgundy.
1.0,It was so tight m. It is supposed to be adult but was child fit.
1.0,The watch was missing.
1.0,This product uses Velcro to keep the lighting unit in its place but does not use any type of slot to mount the unit within the encasement so when you make a fist the front of the light unit pops up above the rim of the mounting ring on the glove it self.  I was planning on using these on my motorcycle but am afraid at high speeds the air will catch the light unit and rip it off.  Also ordered size (L) based on the size chart provided and wish I had ordered a medium instead since the material stretches with use and gets baggy in my palm.<br /><br />Will update this review if I hear from customer service and let you know how my experience with them goes but at this point I would not recommend this product.
1.0,Ordered a multi pack of socks and got 1 pair of leggings.
1.0,"I ordered the yellow gold version, and it looks cheap and low quality in person. This is not worth $40, I wouldn't have kept it even if it cost half that.  Thankful for Amazon's great return policy!"
1.0,"If you have small wrists do not purchase!! My wrist measures 5.6, which it states the small band should fit. It was HUGE. The magnet piece went over and on top of the watch it was so big. Also, as others have pointed out, the navy blue was already scratched up upon opening. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,shirt too cute.. pant are to big material too cheap.
1.0,There is a pocket for everything on this best. The zipper however is on the opposite side that I am used to.
1.0,"I wear a large and bought an XL just to be on the safe side. It was still too small. I like the style, color and feel to it. The forearm part of the sleeve is very tight. I could not put my arm all the way in it."
1.0,It looks super cheap and the arch in the bar is tilted up side down. The flat 5 diamonds that are supposed to lay flat to your belly face down to the ground. I tried to make the best of it and straighten them out with pliers but the metal is too soft.
1.0,Way to small wish amazon would selling for some of these venders don’t don't buy
1.0,"Thin, flimsy, and not warm at all."
1.0,This was all the wrong sizes. The real problem is in trying to return it. The mailing label finally came and it's completely unreadable. Obviously in some other language. My printer won't even print it.<br />Avoid this vender!!!!!
1.0,"My daughter loved the watch! I was excited to see if it would help us with some potty issues. Unfortunately, it didn’t last an entire day. The pin fell out of the wristband after half a days use. I am going to see if I can find a local shop to fix this issue. No product should fall apart within a couple hours of use. Disappointed at the quality of this product."
1.0,Too small. Not flannel as advertised.
1.0,Top fit to small.
1.0,Material was nice but the sizing not even close. Runs very very small.
1.0,"I regularly fly internationally for work, so I needed a sturdy bag. After 1 flight, a wheel fell off and the interior zippers burst. The outer zipper burst while travelling, but nothing fell out because the bag was locked, which seemed to hold it together. I was able to put it back together, but I wanted a reliable suitcase."
1.0,Are not comfortable at all. To tight in part of boot and other part to loose. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Image quality is terrible and blurry
1.0,"When I opened this item, the shirt was covered in animal hair. I’m very unhappy."
1.0,"Very low quality, nice gift though"
1.0,Quality isn’t good
1.0,The shirt is not made well at all. It's almost crooked in construction
1.0,Doesn't work but it looks great 🤔😞
1.0,I thought it was larger but it is for a little girl I guess
1.0,Dress is just cut too small. I’ve ordered it in 2 different sizes and it’s still not right. Thought it would be great for summer but it’s going back.
1.0,"Very disappointed.  When I did a search for kid's friendship bracelets, these came up, but they are all adult sized!  They cannot even be tied to fit."
1.0,They came with a lot of paint missing hard to screw bc the threads have paint. Half are stripped out and don’t even screw in. If I could leave no star I would.
1.0,Everyone was saying go two size up so got a xlarge still was very small
1.0,My husband literally wore his watch for 6hours and it started peeling!? Super cheap and terrible quality. Don’t waste your money smh
1.0,I wanted athletic socks that had some cushion to them - these are extremely thin - like a dress sock.
1.0,I don't know what material these are made with but I hate the way they feel on. They also roll down constantly so the high waisted part really isn't doing it's job. I cannot recommend.
1.0,"Was super excited to get my shoes but once I opened them the heel did not look like the picture portrayed, looks like a more slanted heel online and once I received them there very square more straight heel which  takes away from look, something looked trendy online looks outdated, can't return no return shipping info and threw out original packaging"
1.0,Decal too fake
1.0,I rate this Garbage! This was a Christmas gift and my kid is heart broken.<br />DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Nice but need to be wider its made for very small person to be able to wrap around you can not please contact me  with a larger one would be so pleased.  DENISE Johnson
1.0,"Did not fit my size 8 wrist.  Also, the &#34;G&#34; design on the face is too masculine."
1.0,I love these products but they clearly have piss poor quality control i got one that didn't cover most of my ears
1.0,Poor quality fell apart after a few wears.
1.0,I resulted to using one of my little screw drivers to help me put the damn charm on.
1.0,XL fits more like M......
1.0,This does not fit a charge 5 like it said it did in the description
1.0,"It’s a plastic bracelet with gold over it, however they did make it right and let me ship it back, although I had to pay to send it back."
1.0,Cheap! You get what you pay for
1.0,This strap is beautiful but it will not fit on my sunglasses. The opening is too small. Pretty but poorly designed.
1.0,Cheaply made and changed color after two weeks plus it smells bad!
1.0,Don't waste your money on this ring.  I bought this December of 2020 I wear it every day and the stone is now clear.  The paint/ dye they put on the back of the stone to simulate a mystic topaz has all washed away.  Too bad cause I really liked the ring.
1.0,At first I was in love with these! I bought two pairs. Black and grey. The black pair has been wonderful and I wear it often (maybe once every 1-2 weeks). Yesterday I went to put on the grey pair which I don’t wear usually because they are more see through than I like. I was just running errands and not getting out of the car so I thought that would be fine. This is the second time I have put these on and there is already a hole in the crotch. I’m very disappointed because they are very nice and comfy but I cannot wear them. Beware this is a possibility!!
1.0,"The small was tiny, more for child"
1.0,Sizes r not true to size
1.0,First I like them but less than a week they started changing color u can look at the pic not good to shower in sorry but am just been honest was really looking forward to these but am a lill disappointed they are already changing colors. Well after two weeks it turn green on my feet
1.0,Returned the belts. Buckle is cheap plastic and I couldn’t open it. Probably would have broken
1.0,Not white
1.0,Do not appear as shown in picture
1.0,"In the photo, the blazer has a soft rose/blush undertone in it. Once out of the package, this blazer was a bright as a HIGHLIGHTER. I bought this blazer to wear at work and its just sitting in my closet in the ever so rare event I need an UGLY, HOT PINK, TOO LARGE blazer. :("
1.0,The price is exploitative
1.0,Broken!!
1.0,I normally where a large and since the reviews said runs small I went with XL but still tight and the sleeves were full length not 3/4 like picture and description says. Disappointed!
1.0,"tight across chest and butt, but loose in the waist."
1.0,"I don't want to give this one star, but the only way to leave feedback. This bracelt broke as soon as my daughter put it on. Would never order from them again, but hey you get what you pay for."
1.0,Top did not even hold up boobs!!
1.0,I was super excited about finding this but the minute i opened the bag i was thrown off. The picture looks like a jersey cotton dress and it’s a tacky shiny spandex material that’s like workout wear. It’s horrendous. It’s sad because the length is perfect and fit is good but you just really can’t get past the look of it.
1.0,just fit wrong - had to return
1.0,My medium shirt came with one medium sleeve and one large sleeve!
1.0,They say they are a size 9 but they are so small they barely fit on a pinky finger.  What a waste of money!!
1.0,Very short waisted. Hip hugger tights on me.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 145 pounds so they may work for a shorter person
1.0,Unfortunately the top and sole ripped apart after one month of light use.
1.0,"I typically wear a small or medium. Ordered a medium. I'm 5'10"" with a short waist. This top is not as long as in the picture and it is too tight . I knew the it would be fitted but it is too tight."
1.0,"Extremely small and extremely sheer! I’m only 5 feet tall and 110 pounds and I wouldn’t be comfortable wearing this other than to the pool given how short the front was and how easily it rode up. The dress is also entirely sheer, ENTIRELY."
1.0,"I literally can wear the shirt sleeve as pants. It looks ridiculous on my arms. Unless you are jacking steroids, I can't image this fitting anyone. I love Kirkland Signature and have many of their shirts. So I thought this was an easy choice. I got the same size sleeves as my other ones. I don't know if this is a defect or what. I'm returning it. As far as the shirt itself, it looks good, the craftsmanship is fine, and material is nice. But the huge sleeves make it unwearable.<br /><br />I included a picture of my other blue Kirkland Signature shirt and you can see how much larger the white one is comparatively."
1.0,"the dress should be categorized under Halloween dresses , surely not party or dress up occasions ! The material is so cheap , the design is a joke and it surely can  fit a  5'  girl and not taller than that,  as you may think from the picture. returning it"
1.0,This jacket was made out of great fabric but a size large might have fit a woman who wore a size 6.  In fact the model in the picture is probably wearing a size Large.  DJT was reasonable about returning my money but I did have to pay the postage for the return.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever had to do that before with Amazon Prime.  I would steer clear.
1.0,SCAM! Do NOT BUY!!!!!
1.0,Clearly states these are silicon. They are wooden beads
1.0,Was too small for the watch. Said 42mm and was off by 2/3 mm. The pins were cheap.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1c0e0674cb7ccfee34a9de5b617a82b7]]
1.0,The print/color seems really faded. I question if this is authentic disney and not some chinese knockoff.
1.0,The ones I received don't press the L & R buttons. The pieces that are supposed to press them do not extend nearly enough to work. Would give 0 stars if possible.
1.0,Do not buy this. It is unusable because the tape will not peal off. It is a manufactory defect.
1.0,"Only wore the dress and it rip, poor quality."
1.0,Had it two weeks and it broke.
1.0,"Stunk so badly of petroleum, googled soaking it in baking soda and soap and did it 5 times and still really bad, had to throw it."
1.0,"These were pretty bad. Fogged up easily, and are extremely thin. Barely any clearance between your face and the lens."
1.0,Add they had a hole in them
1.0,Looks cheap. The item that they sent me fit more like a shirt with a long back than a dress. I sent it back
1.0,The  Quality is really bad very  disappointed .
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes up.  There is no stretch.  If you are a busty girl this is a no go if you are larger than a medium.  I'm usually a large and ordered a 3xl
1.0,"great price, but the colors were not accurate at all!! i wish i knew about this before purchasing them!"
1.0,"I did not like anything about this product. The XL was to small the XXL was to large, Poor quality, The hoodie is difficult to adjust where it extends on your shoulders. donated all items to goodwill"
1.0,"To thin, to short ,not comfy. I hate everything about this rag. This just not the garment described or pictured. Total rip off. Will buy from this company again."
1.0,Not great. Drugstore quality. Very thin. Band on top unflattering.
1.0,The waistband elastic is so thin it got twisted just from trying them on! Other than that they seemed like okay shorts. Definitely reflect their price in quality. If you’re looking for durability and quality I wouldn’t buy these.
1.0,Do not use if you get migraines! It triggered migraines when I wore it.
1.0,"Bought these for a play my 7 yr old son was in. They repeatedly fell off prior to the play. In his frustration he refused to wear them, so he wasn't in  costume. Wouldnt buy again.."
1.0,It's beyond short and small
1.0,Lasted a little over 3 weeks with minimal wear
1.0,Se enreda sola
1.0,Looks like sweater but it's not. Looks very cheap not very good quality at all
1.0,"Doesn't look good, it's really loose and big. It also broke the third time I tried putting it on. Not worth my money."
1.0,Cute but gems started to fall off after 2 days of wear!! Disappointed.
1.0,Definitely not what i thought
1.0,These will not hold up in the washing machine. My daughter wore them twice before I washed them and the elastic strap shredded and is barely hanging on. Fit as expected. Would not recommend this brand.
1.0,Too thick couldn’t breathe
1.0,So much smaller than I expected! These were supposed to decorate the soil around a plant for a friend's B-Day. These won't work! Lol. They were the size of fruity pebbles. The picture is not the actual size. Do not be mislead. Not worth the money.
1.0,"Very disappointing!  I wore it 2x and the bracelet fell apart. It untied easily and frayed. It looks awful. Can’t wear it anymore. In a week I’ve gone through 3 bracelets. Maybe if you glue it or wax it before you wear it, It may last a little longer."
1.0,Product description says sterling silver and 18K gold which its not I was really excited about this ring until I got in it's just cheep costume jewelry that turns your fingers green and gives you blisters after the first day because it's jagged absolutely disappointed 😞 waste of my money
1.0,"Originally gave these bands a 5 star BUT now they are a zero. At 26 weeks pregnant one of the bands, that I’d had on for a few days minus regular take off times, made HALF OF MY WRIST BLISTER! I almost had to go to the er due to them being so bad, I didn’t do ANYTHING out of my norm, I emailed the customer support, that was on the 26th, so SIX business days later, and not one word from them."
1.0,"Were hard to get in at first, and if you don't keep checking them, they fall out. 3 days and lost them both"
1.0,Looks and feels like soft plastic vs good silicone.
1.0,Poor quality. Fabroc is thin and very wrinkle prone. Print is awful looks like some you would buy from a DG store. Would have returned this item but ran out of time.
1.0,This is the 2nd watch I bough from Amazon.... first one broke in 8 weeks time and this one has a dead battery already after just 3 months time.  Too late too return.  Disgusted
1.0,This dark blue model is much longer than the electric blue. There is no way this is made of 100% cotton. This seems to have synthetic fiber and or some elastase fabric. I wear slim fit in most brand and this is NOT classic fit it is a very slim fit for a large.
1.0,"very tiny, more for a baby not an adult"
1.0,I didn't like it it got all ugly
1.0,This is a horrible jacket. The arms were almost a foot longer then mine and I have really long arms. Poorly made.
1.0,"Good shirt but too slim fit, not flattering around the waist (belly and love handles will come off), length of sleeves is right, so if you order a bigger size, sleeves would be too long"
1.0,Very uncomfortable.  Did not work.
1.0,DONT BUY IT LOOKS VERY CHEAP
1.0,Poor quality. Would not recommend for adults and definitely not for kids.
1.0,Horrible material.  I hand washed it and hung to dry before wearing.  It got all wrinkled up and twsited and stayed that way. So I have never worn it and can't return it because I wahsed it.
1.0,The middle piece between the breast stick out not very comfortable
1.0,"All my 4 year old son wanted for Christmas from Santa was a cap gun. He was THRILLED upon opening it and after the first shot, a plastic piece inside the trigger snapped and the gun could no longer shoot caps. VERY disappointing and waste of money!"
1.0,The needles dont work I change the first one hoping to get another good one but it turn to be a bad also i will not recomend d this watch is nice but dont work >
1.0,"Pictures are pretty cute, but the prints are those stickers( you see on Tees) not woven into the material. So they are very hard, especially for the pants. Pants are unwearable.<br />Returned the product."
1.0,Cheap material with several lines down the front...item was returned.
1.0,I will never wear these. They would fit a size 0. The fabric is cheesy.
1.0,I bought this for my husband from our little girl and he loved it. Sadly after 2 weeks it broke with just normal use.
1.0,Size chart said it would fit.  It did not.
1.0,"Size is not good, doesn’t fit what it claimed for"
1.0,Didn’t survive a washing. No longer stay up. Looked great but not really compression socks
1.0,"Super cheap material. Will be returning. Weird fit around the chest as well, and I'm a full figured woman. Just definitely not what I wanted. Idea is cute, execution is horrible. Really strong chemical smell as well..."
1.0,"In the car, they're great....Bright, clear vision and great glare prevention.  Outside, they suck.  All I see are my own eyes reflecting in the lenses.  The provided lanyard is a joke, came apart while attaching to the glasses.  And the website and customer service are useless.  A warranty is only good if the company stands behind it. The case is the only quality item."
1.0,The top material is okay but the fit is loose. The neck hole would be better cut higher (bateau) or squared. The attached skirt is big. The lining is cheap plastic fabric that makes noise with each move. Overall unflattering for 6P.
1.0,they are a weird material and HUGE
1.0,"It's doesn't stay tight and it broke 2 days after I got it. This thing is cheap, flimsy and it just sucks. I wish there was a way to give it no stars."
1.0,"I’m normally a size 8, medium pants.  I bought these sweatpants a few years ago size xl cause I like them big a baggy.  I could barely get the xl up, they fit more like a small.<br />Couldn’t return cause I washed before I wore them."
1.0,Broke as soon as we tried to put it on the wrist.  Have to return it.  Clasp came off the leather clasp.  Kind of small for a man.
1.0,Glasses seem much like a toy. Very difficult to adjust to my specification. Did not magnify to my satisfaction.
1.0,"We really loved these shoes when we first got them. Comfortable and had a great traction. I loved that they were advertised as waterproof, since we live in the Northwest and my son hates rain boots. We also loved that they were easy for him to put on and didn't have to worry about shoe laces coming untied. HOWEVER, he only wore them for a month and a half and they began coming apart as indicated in the first 2 photos. He hadn't even worn them in the rain yet. Then, a month later, the outer layer (I guess the waterproof layer) peeled off and the sole came apart. He had only worn them in some light rain a couple of times. Wish we could return them because we are completely disappointed in the quality of these shoes. Wish they had lasted at least 6 months :("
1.0,I ordered a 2X and it was about a size 10
1.0,Returned this item. Received tightly packed in bubble in a jumbled mess. The beads are on a wire and could not make the wire straighten out. Also some wires had many fewer beads than other wires.
1.0,Way too small.. very disappointed
1.0,This is sooooo not what the picture showed and the color is ugly. There is no bottom hem. Would not recommend this at all!!
1.0,Do not buy l did bought these 4 weeks ago and they are already falling apart. Buy nice or buy twice.
1.0,Started turning my granddaughters finger green. Not true 925 silver. Just plated
1.0,Nooo don’t fall for the low price please. You can get a better vest on sale or clearance at Macy’s at comparable price. Please save yourself a hastle of buying it only to return it.
1.0,Runs way to one small and goes really high up. Nothing like the pic.
1.0,"This bra did not fit me well,"
1.0,I have tried this ring with several NFC readers (both mobile and PC based). The ring simply does not work. do not buy.
1.0,I wish I had read the reviews! This hat is TINY and doesn’t have much stretch. It definitely won’t fit my older daughters head..  it won’t even fit my 2 year old. Waste of money.
1.0,"Very disappointing.  I wear a 36C cup bra.  This dress was so tight across my chest it basically said ""look at my boobs"".  It also brought the waist seam over my chest.  Since this is a Vine review item, I can't return it, but it has already gone into the pile to donate to Goodwill."
1.0,"This shirts tag says 35% cotton and 65% polyester. Maybe it's cotton but then that means the TWO tags on the shirt are wrong. The Amazon listing says it's 100% cotton. After receiving the shirt today I was about to try it on and noticed that the hanging tag attached to the neck label said the shirt was 35 cotton/65poly. This was also true of the other label  on the lower side seam. Just a big waste of time dealing with this. I've printed out the return label, put the slip with the shirt in the package, sealed it, covered over all appropriate bar codes and now I can look forward to going on a not planned for drive to the post office in the rain! A lot of work because of a really stupid mistake...or is it really a mistake and they are just trying to unload a bunch of polyester shirts by putting the word cotton in the title."
1.0,I return these they were huge and very cheap
1.0,The top is not the same as pictured at all and was not wearable at all. Also make sure to order 2 sizes bigger than you actually are.
1.0,Decent quality yet doesn't stay in place so it's useless!  Don't waste your money.  Just another shiny piece of junk that I can't throw away.
1.0,"Wasted my money.  Unless you are a candidate for Little Women of LA, it is useless.<br />Don't waste your money."
1.0,Beautiful ring. Not at all what i ordered. Its not 925 silver.
1.0,I am only 5'5 this swimsuit fits but the torso is way to short so I can't wear it but it's cute just not the right fit never had that problem with a one piece 🙁
1.0,TINY!!  Only those with the smallest frame should even consider!  Didn't like the style in person either. It was like a cheap wide belt with straps sewn on. It reminded me of the back braces they wear in warehouse jobs!
1.0,"Has plenty of suction but, when it gets to the deep end it doesn't leave it............just moves in a 6 food diameter circle...The hose is pulsing like crazy but, it just wont leave the bottom."
1.0,One handle already ripped off after only using it a few times.
1.0,Color faded after 2 wears
1.0,"It fits but I thought it would be soft material, it is almost like jersey material, slippery, not a sweater"
1.0,Wayyy crooked writing on this thing
1.0,Had to return it despite ordering based on their size chart.  Way too small!  order a size or even two bigger!
1.0,I was about to order the Large until I read some reviews. Bought the XXL thinking it would fit very large and roomy for the pool/beach. Not the case!! Terrible sizing information. It’s tiny!!
1.0,"This dress doesn’t feel too cheap, but the cut is terrible. It fits bigger than the average medium. I’m 5’3 and 130lbs due to butt, and boobs. The arms are baggy, and the length is too long."
1.0,They look like what I paid for them. They were not the best quality but I got what I paid for
1.0,States 20mm but is a 22mm. Had to return.
1.0,Doesn't  live up to the picture. The picture looks much more elegant than the real thing. The gold metal is three different colors of gold.  It looks very cheap.
1.0,They make them look like they are really nice. But honestly the worst tank tops I’ve ever bought
1.0,Shoes are garbage. They were coming apart when I took them out of box. Cheap sandals made in China. Comparable to $4.99 flip flops. Would not last 1 summer.
1.0,Product doesn’t look anything like what I got.  Mine was a V neck instead of a scoop neck and it’s really long.  Not short and sexy.  Plus the picture makes it look like it’s a hat and not a hood.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"Night driving glares are a big problem for me and these glasses did absolutely nothing to help. In fact, I see clearer without them. I should have looked at the other reviews more closely. Most weren't overly impressed but have five stars anyway!<br />Unfortunately, since I avoid night driving, I missed the return window before I could check them out . . . ."
1.0,The pants are so small. The XXL looks like an XS.
1.0,"This hat is 100% polyester, according to its label. Also, the brim is so narrow it cannot be used to keep the sun off your face."
1.0,very small and cheap material
1.0,Cute but my daughter complained that scarf and hat was itchy
1.0,Very cute jeans but the zipper was broken and unable to be saved. Check your pants before you remove tags!
1.0,Very thin—looks and feels cheap.
1.0,Fell a part almost instantly.  Very flimsy and cheap. Should be priced at $5 or less.  Very disappointed.
1.0,For being wireless this was less comfortable than some of my underwire bras!
1.0,"If you want the shirt to fit like the picture, (where it's super low on the sides and flowy) get 2 sizes bigger.<br />It's still nice and very light. But not like the picture"
1.0,School bag my butt. This is so small it is smaller than a notebook. Waste of money
1.0,Too big for a woman’s face and the material is so thick it’s suffocating and muffled your voice when you’re talking from how much loose material hangs directly over your mouth.
1.0,"I love love love it- but the chain stains my neck green every time I wear it, so I can’t really wear it at all.  It’s so cute too- with a better chain it’d be perfect, but with the chain it’s on it’s basically garbage."
1.0,"UPDATE!<br />Now I am stuck with this dress as return shipping to Dubai is $150! Do NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY! Ridiculous!<br /><br />From all the other reviews, I had big expectations of this dress. SO disappointed. While it is pretty, it is not made well at all. There are two layers of underskirt, one is straight and silky while the top layer is sheer and flowing. I'm sending mine back because 1) The top skirt had so much extra material that should have been trimmed off before being sewn together, but instead was folded over and sewn to the skirt under it. So much, that it made it bulge and bunch up at the top of skirt by the hips. I took it to a seamstress and she would have had to separate them, trim several inches off the sides and then put it back together for it to lay properly. Which would have cost me as much as the dress.😞 2) The zipper took us forever to zip. Once again, extra material in the back kept getting caught in the zipper. 3) The ""bra cups"" are a formed thin cardboard (like what you find in the toe of new boots) sewn in between the layers of fabric and are hard and make a rustling noise against the fabric when you move.  Obviously very hurried and poor craftsmanship. I think it's the luck of the draw with what you get."
1.0,It was to big I expected it to be tighter and fit perfect
1.0,"The chains are cheaply made, so be careful with tugging & pulling on it because it will break."
1.0,I was very disappointed when I received this bracelet.  Immediately went to return it.
1.0,These are super dark and almost opaque. If worn for more than 8 hours you may lose circulation in your leg.
1.0,"I like nothing about this outfit. The color isn’t what I ordered, its supposed to be silver…this is a sage color… it’s too small… the bodice piece has foam cups sewn in between layers… not good, and besides they are close together and very small. Once opened, it smelled like dead fish. Wasted money and I feel stuck with a bad product"
1.0,"Arrived with a hole in it. Nephew wanted to still wear it today, so did not return it."
1.0,This shirt does not look at fashionable in person as in the picture on Amazon. I am a fan of soft fabric but this one was poorly made. I had to pay almost the same amount as the cost of the shirt so I ended up giving it away. I won't be buying from this buyer again.
1.0,"Half of them were broken/unusable when they arrived. The ones that weren’t broken, broke quickly once used."
1.0,Zero compression. Basic tanks. Waste.
1.0,This dress is very tight material. I ordered a 16 and it fir like size 6. Not very good dress
1.0,liked the boots but to small
1.0,Did not like tie dyed look top to tight across my fat stomach should have ordered a medium
1.0,Way to small. I’m<br />Usually a med. i ordered a lg the waist was super tiny
1.0,This costume says xl but it fits like a women’s small.
1.0,After about a month the card pockets ripped down the side and everything could have easily fallen out at any time. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"The quality is good but the sizing is way off. My biceps measured 11"" around so I bought a large as per the sizing chart. Way too tight. They cut off circulation & I got sores on both upper biceps and I don't have particularly large arms for an adult man."
1.0,Horrible fit. Got a 38DD. I wear 36D. It was still so micro my tatas looked liked stuffed sausages packed in lace.<br /><br />Wonderful uni-boob affect
1.0,They weren't the right gloves to begin with compared to the picture. They were biking gloves.
1.0,NOT WORTH THE MONEY 💩💩💩 I GOT EARRINGS THAT DO NOT MATCH. The picture up top in misleading.. AF
1.0,Way too small. A large is more like a tub top.
1.0,"returning, gloves have a chemical smell that won't go away."
1.0,Toe strap broke less than two months after purchase with only ocaasional wear. Won't be buying this low quality sandal again.
1.0,Asian size...way to small...
1.0,"The dress I received does not look like the photo. It’s poorly made, fabric was not a good quality and got strangely. I would not recommend this dress."
1.0,I bought this necklace for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. The day after Christmas I notice that the pearl is completely gone. Very upsetting considering I did pay a decent amount for it and now it looks as if I won the necklace out of a quarter machine.
1.0,Zipper was broken when I received in the mail.
1.0,"Ok so when I day this bra is small, I ordered a 32d and it fit like a 32b. Victoria secret is they can't measure lol."
1.0,Just came already worn I was very disappointed
1.0,The size chart is wack the measurements are way off they need to fix that . The short are cheap really thin material
1.0,"Bought these for a Halloween costume to keep my daughter warm & look cute. They have NO stretch, so they were difficult to put on. They were also so thin they wouldn’t have kept her warm anyway."
1.0,it is way to small
1.0,"Not good quality. However, they fit well and will last for probably one wearing"
1.0,The item looks great but really not well made/engineered.  I have only had them a month and they broke already.  I don't  wear them everyday.  I was wearing them today and they fell off my face.  The arm just broke in half.  Very disappointed because I took my time replacing an old beloved pair that lasted several years. These were similar and unfortunately didn't even last a Month.  Now I'm out the cost and a pair of sunglasses.  Sad.
1.0,"Fit to small. She didn’t get to wear it other than trying it on an taking a few pictures in it. It was to tight, she couldn’t breathe while wearing the dress"
1.0,Wore it once in the rain it tore under the arm and then ripped straight down I was soaked and got sick From Being exposed to elements!
1.0,Too big and looks sloppy.
1.0,Poor quality. Nothing like the picture
1.0,"The dress does NOT look the same in person, the slit on the side is barely visible. Slit is hidden unless you yourself pull the dress to the side to show the slit. The dress is NOT flattering at all, I got a large and it did NOT fit. It had absolutely NO stretch AT ALL. And it's extremely long, also wrinkles very easily. Do don't waste your money!"
1.0,"While I have nothing negative to say about the coat itself, this will still, unfortunately, be a negative review. The main problem I have is with the info on the product page. While it shows up on the North American version of the site, the sizing info is in Asian measurements. They do suggest ordering at least 2 sizes bigger than you would normally get. However, and this is where it gets confusing, when you start digging into the size chart a bit more thoroughly, it reads as though the size you would normally get should be the size to order. So, I did this and the coat I got was at least 2 if not 3 sizes too small.<br /><br />Therefore, if you're looking to purchase one of these, make sure you check the sizing thoroughly and, as will likely be necessary, order it at least 2 sizes bigger than you actually need."
1.0,"This wallet is quite bulky. Also, the fabric cut around the I.D. display isn't sewn well and the fabric frays quickly. So, basically this wallet will start to falling apart the second you start to use it. I accidentally ordered two. When the first one started going (day 1), I figured I'd return it and rely on the second one. Well, day 2 I decided they both would be returned due to the same issue. There's better products. Don't bother with this wallet."
1.0,"Shirt size is too small, but it is very long. could almost be a dress. not flattering at all"
1.0,Disappointed that its not cotton
1.0,I wear a size 2 and even though I unlaced it all the way I still couldn't wear it
1.0,my girlfriend wore it twice. it broke when she took it off the second time!! had it 2 days!
1.0,I have ordered leggings many times before and they fit true to size.  I ordered 2XL and I can't even get them over my calf.  I am going to give them to my size 10 daughter.
1.0,I thought this product looked cute but it broke within two hours! I was just walking when it broke also the snake kept flipping so i had to keep flipping it back. I really like the idea of this and really wished it would of lasted longer than just two hours.... :/
1.0,Tarnished and something from a dollar store.
1.0,"The product looks terrible, police emblem look like it was burned and cheap made.."
1.0,"These were advertised as men's socks - and were expensive - but they're tiny, super-thin, and really disappointing."
1.0,Cheap and not worth a penny.
1.0,Cheaply crafted with crap materials. Broke immediately.
1.0,The gloves were too big...looked like it was for a man.
1.0,"Best to purchase at least 2 sizes up. The product photo of the thick girl wearing it is photo shop, not even an XL would fit such a figure. It makes me mad because that photo was what encouraged me to buy it as a fellow thick chick. The cut of it is best suited to a straight up and down figure. Not really any stretch."
1.0,I can't get them to insert properly and not look ridiculous.  Don't bother with these
1.0,"I bought 3X, label said 3X, but it wasn't 3X. More like one X. Also very light-weight, not what I was hoping for in a sweater."
1.0,Product fell apart at the buckle.  Very dissatisfied.
1.0,The chain was broken on arrival. The sunflower doesn’t match up and it doesn’t stay closed.
1.0,"Didnt fit, way too big"
1.0,Cloth is like shower curtain material.  The daisy print is adorable.  European sizing.
1.0,Does not work. Used it to keep a gold tooth in. Would not stick to it.
1.0,the belt was ordered one size larger than my pants waist size.  it is not even close to the size indicated if you choose to buy one get it at least 2  sizes larger. maybe the were on the metric system.
1.0,"It's a stunning ring, in my opinion.  Sure, it's not hand made with perfect edges, but it's very nice without magnification.  However, the electroplating on the ring I was sent was reversed.  The gold was on top with the silver on the bottom.  I gave it one star because it was what I ordered.  However, the one start does not reflect my option of the craftsmanship."
1.0,"Ear loops are not made for a human.  The holes might fit my dog’s head and ear shape. However, I just wanted to return them.<br />Fabric is nice feeling yet cut and sewn for a person that has a tiny nose."
1.0,"Way to big !! This watch was not made to fit a woman's wrist. It is off round and very heavy and chunky, to the point of being gawkey looking. Also, this watch does not come in a gift box or a velvet bag, It came in unsealed plastic bag inside a cardboard box.<br />On a positive note, shipping is very fast !"
1.0,This item is not true to size as far as the shorts go. They are fluffy in the front.
1.0,I normally wear a size 34 and could barely get these pants over my calves.
1.0,I hate the way it looks on me
1.0,Pretty awesome product
1.0,The material it see through.  just hold it up I can see it’s too thin to feel it it appropriate to be worn in public
1.0,Well the watch doesn’t work at all. Nice looking looks great but doesn’t work I don’t know if it’s the battery . Very disappointed
1.0,"Do not recommend. I expected a flat more fitted belt. Instead, there is so much overlap of elastic and the buckle is bulky. Great if you just need to hold up your trousers, but not attractive for suits or nicer outfits. Fitted shirts cannot be worn over the belt.<br />This is going to the donation pile."
1.0,This is a 2 plus not a a 1ct fast shipping though gave to a friend to big !!!
1.0,Nothing came in the package when I bought it.
1.0,It's very small and can't be useful during an emergency
1.0,"The earring broke when I was at to take the stopper off, poor manufacturing"
1.0,It doesn’t look like the pic at all !!<br />I’m 8 months pregnant and it still is huge !!<br />I ordered a medium
1.0,Bottom of dress too heavy to support top fabric. stretches in all the wrong places.
1.0,Dress was nothing like the picture. I actually hated it. Wouldn't suggest any one buys it.
1.0,I should have taken a picture but I sent this thing back faster than I got it.<br /><br />The fabric nothing like what is pictured. There were loose threads and spots where the stitching hadn't been finished without a mess. It was basically something that I think a high schooler could make easily in Home Ec. It was laughably different from the picture... I couldn't even consider it a cardigan. It looked kind of like a smock a dog groomer wears.<br /><br />Purposefully misrepresented item. Don't waste your time.
1.0,"This product does not fit well, it cost more to return it than buy it almost. Not happy to waste my money!"
1.0,Very uncomfortable  cheap feeling
1.0,"I want to return the item because it isn’t as described , it didn’t fit my key and the buttons are not aligned"
1.0,CHEAP JUNK PRODUCT THAT DID NOT EVEN WORK TOTALLY WORTHLESS AND A  TOTAL RIP-OFF LITERALLY JUNK DON'T EVER PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AND DON'T EVER PURCHASE THIS ITEM JUNK JUNK  JUNK RIP OFF
1.0,Not what I expected. They look cheap like I got them from the dollar store. Plus they are BIG
1.0,low quality material and part around the neck is &#34;choking&#34; so I end up using my scissors to cut the shirt and use for a workout
1.0,This are a rip off brand of aesthetic revolution...<br />Very cheap mine arrived with huge rip on side. Ordered a medium and fit like extra small... Thankfully it was only 12 dollars. Also took 3 weeks to arrive lol
1.0,Only one pair not broken. Earring backs are a joke. Had to glue back together and buy earring backs you can pick up.
1.0,This band never fit in the right direction into my Apple Watch.  The only way I could wear it is if I didn’t care about the snap to be on the inside face down.  Very irritating.  So I just tossed it.  I couldn’t send it back because I had the links taken out
1.0,Not a towel for shower<br />Doesn't dry water<br />It's just a robe
1.0,I returned this watch band because it was very cheaply made. The glitter was falling off. It was not sealed into the band. Disappointing!
1.0,Ordered a medium that was a little too small and the large came and the top part of the dress was poor quality like it belonged on a much larger dress size.
1.0,Love the vest size just a little small
1.0,These are WAY too small. I couldn't even get them over my knees they were too small.
1.0,Piece of junk. It malfunctioned within minutes of turning on. Making a high pitched sound as loud as a fire alarm. Basically had to smash it to get it to stop.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:2547dae265edfda673d7907f80aecf3c]] I loved these however it’s not all one piece which makes it hard to keep up with I don’t like the pieces
1.0,"The item did come quicker than expected. It’s absokutely horrible, too small, inferior fabric, and exactly what you’d get for the price. I would never buy clothing from amazon again."
1.0,I didnt like this at all. Not the material that I expected and is a smaller fit than normal
1.0,"Absolute worst ""rain coat"" ever. It didn't even block .5% of the water."
1.0,They sent me a top with a clasp that didn’t work.<br />The bottoms were cute.
1.0,Pants didn't fit as expected.  The inseam came down way too low and looked extremely weird. The fabric was very thin and cheap.
1.0,The dress had side seams that were not sewn together on both sides of the dress. The pattern on the dress was very pretty!  Returning
1.0,The material is so cheap
1.0,The top is cute but the body of the top is like swim suit material.  You would need to buy up 2-3 sizes.  I ended up returning it.
1.0,"I was going to use it for a cosplay, the more I messed with it? The more I realized how much of a choking hazard it is. It doesn't stick no matter how hard you suck unfortunately, so don't waste your money."
1.0,Meh.  I bought this for my tragus piercing and honestly... it just sits weird and it's way too big.  There just isn't a way that the moon will sit vertical so that the shape shows.  The quality just isn't there and I wore it for the amount of time it took to take the picture.  If you're looking for a tragus earring - keep looking.
1.0,"After reading reviews, I sized up. I would honestly need to have sized up two to three times. These fit my five year old granddaughter."
1.0,"I do not at all like these shorts!!!! They are not at all what they are advertise. They're about 3 sizes off the size that you order. They are very thick, hot, and too heavy! I want to get my money back!!!!!!"
1.0,runs way small will not cover waist!
1.0,Not impressed at all. Too small and they are dry clean only yucky
1.0,"Thin, too thin to be if any use Corona virus wise, like an exercise shirt"
1.0,Lost bracelet on the second wear kept coming undone
1.0,. The shirts were used. Full of makeup and the armpit area was all dirty
1.0,"These glasses made my eyes hurt, so I just threw it away. You get what you pay for."
1.0,The only item in my bag was the skirt and it is missing the top.
1.0,Rings broke within an hour of wearing tehn
1.0,It was very ugly material and it was not what we were looking for. Looks very cheaply made.
1.0,All of them broke within 1 or 2 uses
1.0,This fabric is cheap and doesn’t look like the picture. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Awful... will not order anything again.  Cut of fabric is extremely skimpy so unless you are 10 years old and have the figure of a popsicle stick forget it.  Looks nothing like the photo.  More like a sausage casing.
1.0,"Not as pictured, do not waist your money. Cheap Cheap"
1.0,"I bought this for a Gift for a flower girl for a wedding and was too embarrassed to even give it to her, now it just sits in my closest. the bow and some flowers weren’t centered correctly. Definitely would not recommend to anyone! And it was on the small side anyways! Ugh!"
1.0,Had to return bc the hour/min hands broke.
1.0,"The suspenders do not fit a 6'2"" man!"
1.0,"oh i so disliked this product, the nosal came right off before washing or putting it on, the material is not good at all, not worth buying"
1.0,"So pretty, but it broke within the first week with extremely light wear."
1.0,These glasses are super cheaply made! Do not buy from this seller! These broke within days. Super flimsy and they are barely shaded.
1.0,The frames are too flimsy. They bend easily. I don’t expect them to last long. They’re cheap in price because they are so cheap in quality.
1.0,cheap coated plastic
1.0,Battery was dead when we got it and it doesn’t keep time.  Every day you have to rest it. Very disappointed.
1.0,bad Condition.  It came broken. Metal that goes in ear holes on both earrings was bent bad.
1.0,"Horrible Mask, don’t buy"
1.0,"Awful the size fit fine, but the backing in it looks awful and won’t lay correctly, it’s really cheaply made. One wear with wash is all you will get."
1.0,Was completely see through
1.0,I purchased the angel wing pendant in honor of my grandfather. I was drawn to how detailed the wings looked in the stock photo. This charm is extremely small and doesn’t have much sparkle. I’m keeping it as a spacer charm.
1.0,A mi hijo le encanta por el hecho de tener la foto de Sonic pero la calidad de la playera no es nada buena para el precio las costuras de los hombros venían abiertas .
1.0,"Buyer Beware! Ships from China. The dress is super small. I ordered a size 12. What I received was a dress with no size label. At best it is a size 6.<br />To return it must be sent back to China. That could take weeks. Then to receive a refund...who knows. I opted to cut my losses and put in the Goodwill bag. Also the material is some type of undisclosed polyester. Yes, I did learn a lesson!"
1.0,"The material is not as I had expected. I read the reviews which were correct about the zipper being sharp and not easy to zip. I washed it according to directions right out of the vacuum sealed bag it was shipped in with hopes of bringing it back to life but it remained the same matted material to me resembling a well used blanket that has been washed many times. I wanted to like this sweater, was planning on using it for work but it’ll be used around the house instead."
1.0,For juniors only
1.0,"This cross was not what I anticipated. Much smaller than I hoped. Also, the chain was not appealing. I wouldn't recommend this product. Had to return for refund"
1.0,3 out the pack broke instantly
1.0,Terrible.  The sticky glue that’s suppose to keep the bra in place does not stay on.  Save your self the headache and your money.<br /><br />Also some of the reviews for this product seems to be for bed sheets and not the bra.<br /><br />Product won’t last and does not work as intended.  Will be returning this item!  Zero stars!
1.0,Very cheap looking. Not very nice
1.0,My 6 year old  granddaughter loved getting this watch for her birthday but withIn 5 days it stopped working and would not start up again.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"I love this bag in terms of its color and size.  It’s perfect as a work tote.  Unfortunately, after using it only 10 times max to take a relatively light load of papers and other items to my office, one of the straps completely ripped away.  When I called and emailed Kate Spade customer service, they refused to do anything except sell me detachable straps.  I have had many Kate Spade bags that are still going strong years later.  I was very disappointed that poor manufacturing was not addressed by the company (in large part because I purchased this on Amazon).  I know the company was sold a few years ago and wonder if this has affected the quality of the products.  It’s a very pretty bag but certainly not well made.  I’ll get it repaired but will not be able to use it as I intended because I don’t want to risk another problem with the straps.  I will try to get the repair shop to reinforce the attachments."
1.0,It wasn’t stretched enough and it’s not true to size
1.0,So I bought a 2xl cause I wasn’t sure if the xl was big enough. Sad to say the 2xl was like a child size fit in the legs and that was about it. Be careful when buying. Great material I give them that and two pockets. Wish they fit 😓😓😪😪😭😭<br />Was this review helpful to you?
1.0,"Comfy and cute, but shoddily made.  The pockets ripped after a few days. So basically, it's headed for the landfill after a few uses, unless you are good at repairing poorly made clothing."
1.0,dress looks a hot mess...
1.0,Bracelet very fashionable but has NO durability. Got a replacement & it broke as well. Should b made w better material & increase price.
1.0,Way too small. Wasn’t what I expected at all.
1.0,I order one lanyard but got package of three for too much money. Next time will go to Walmart. Twists up and cant undo twisting.
1.0,"Don't buy this! It is not at all a woman's dress, let alone ""missy"" or ""junior"" sized.  In America, it would be ""girls"" sizing."
1.0,"Not what I expected, and finally arrived 10-days late..."
1.0,These are too big falls off your hands they also break easily
1.0,"I didn’t expect much, but since I got a size above what I where, I figured it would fit, and I was wrong. It is also made of terrible fabric. I would highly suggest against buying this product. I’m returning immediately!"
1.0,I wore these to walk in water as exercise.  They only last for 3 times in the pool.  The sole started shredding to pieces.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,This umbrella wasn't new and it is not 42 inches either. Very disappointed. Waste of my time and my money.
1.0,Never received them!
1.0,Not anything as described or in picture
1.0,Mine can scratched.. I want it replaced. Can't see where the scratch leans
1.0,Fog up quickly and make the clear part useless
1.0,"Shiny, nylon looking fabric.  Hated it and returned.  Was hoping to have more of a cotton feel."
1.0,Product runs big and the material feels cheap
1.0,Very thin.  Not shaped like foot and leg.
1.0,If I could I'd give it no stars it looks like a dog got a hold of it. I'll update when I get a reply from them as to whether or not I can get a replacement.
1.0,The color is way darker than what is showed. I needed this plum color but instead I got dark purple. So if you want that pretty plum dont order this. Its not correct.
1.0,Couldn't return it fast enough. Runs small and short. Completely see-through - literally like one layer of thin chiffon. And the pattern is obnoxious in person. It's Minnie Mouse style polka dots.
1.0,The size chart is very confusing the item was much smaller than the size selected!
1.0,It kept falling apart.  Surprised I never lost it.
1.0,"I ordered a medium after reading review that stated this item runs small I usually wear a 4, but this item was extremely small and uncomfortable. It is being returned"
1.0,"They do not work as expected, hurt my ears and head. To add insult to injury, it costs almost as much to return them as it does to buy them. Do not waste your money on this item."
1.0,I received this necklace broken. Not too happy about it!
1.0,The description states that there’s 45 pieces but you only get 30. They don’t glow in the dark either
1.0,"I have ordered these tank tops in the past and loved them however this time my experience was much different.... The size fit as expected. I am an XL, size 18, large breasted. I ordered and XL and they would have been perfect … except for some reason now the straps hook to the back of the tank top in an odd angle. see pictures. I realize the pictures in the add show that, but what in the world. It was SO ANNOYING... I put my straps up and started folding socks. these 3 pictures (minus a small adjustment above my breasts to not show additional cleavage in the final picture) this is what happens when you move.. this happened after less than a minute... I kept having to move the straps back on my shoulder until finally I took the darn thing off. I will be sending these back, I am disappointed that they are so different. Just ODD... :( I showed in the first two pictures how the bra should be and wanted to show how far the strap goes to the side. I have never had an issue like this before."
1.0,It runs very large. The fabric is stiff and rough after a few washes. It is nothing like it is described and the comments made it sound just perfect for me.<br /><br />The color is beautiful.<br /><br />I ask again if anyone knows how to make this fabric soft to the touch. Thank you.
1.0,"Windbreaker feel, look and smell. Another Amazon shirt that reminds me of a big scrub top made with a hair salon plastic cape"
1.0,Product was not of any quality
1.0,Cute print on the fabric but that's where it stops. The top is very short and super wide. I ordered a 3/6 month outfit and the top didn't fit my petite 7 month old because it was too snug and too wide. The sleeves were very short. The pants fit like they were 9 month pants. I even held them up to Carter's 9 month pants and they were the same size. Would not recommend.
1.0,My daughter is 11 and I ordered up a size (she's normally in a 10-12). Still too tight. Washed it after she tried it on because she cut the price tag off. 🤦 Unraveled at the top after only one wash. 😡
1.0,"I order the size 8 to 9 year old. They are so small we are gifting them to my 5 year old niece. My daughter could not even pull them up past her thighs, she wears a size 7."
1.0,Cute glasses. But they lasted one or two wears. I purchased one pair and they broke immediately so I Returned them. The second pair also  broke!
1.0,I ordered 2 of these in 2 different colors. The black color started coming off right away and the metal under the black finish really irritates my skin. My wrist is all raw currently. The silver finish came off also but after a lot of wear and tear. It held up much better than the black. The silver watch didn't cause my wrist any problems.
1.0,Looking for workout crossfit shorts. Unfortunately these shorts feel and look like men’s boxer briefs . I felt awkward wearing these outside to workout . Plus little to no control on waist band .
1.0,Would not fit on Versa 3 as promised
1.0,Go up 4 Sizes! This made for children and very skinny teens. Material is light weight and soft.
1.0,Runs very small. I am a size 12 and I ordered a 2X and there’s no way I’m getting into these. Returning all of them as I bought them in multiple colors and felt confident that a 2X would be OK since I normally wear an XL and pants.
1.0,"Shoes aren’t as comfortable as they look in pictures, I really had to wear these on my first day of work as a mandatory wear so I wore them but when trying to contact the seller to see if I can get a bigger size or exchange them even after being worn they claim I had to contact amazon customer service but no one got back to me. Horrible customer service"
1.0,The fabric was not what I expected and the size is not an X-large for Americans. The sizes are for women who are very small.
1.0,"I like the dress but it's to large, and then am trying to return it but I'm not going through with return process"
1.0,"I tried out five different ""sports bras"".  I am 5' tall and wear a 40H (professionally sized).<br /><br />Of the five I tried this one was the least supportive.  It was so lax I was hanging all over the place... covered, but no support to the breast on the arm side.  I couldn't swing my arms without hitting my breast let alone walk across my bedroom floor.<br /><br />SYROKAN Women's Bounce Control Wirefree Front Adjustable High Impact Maximum Support Sports Bras Grey 40H  ~  I ordered the 40H and it fit to a point, I guess?  My boobs were squished together and created a monoboob.  Even if they hadn't been compressed... this bra would still give a monoboob result.<br />I tried a quick walk through my bedroom and I was bouncing.  No way could I jog or even do some biking with this bra.  Too much movement.  The only bra out of the five I tried that worked was the all round blue bra from SpecifiXs.  I was afraid to order the SpecifiXs bra because it had a molded cup.  Typical molded cups do not work for me because I am so short waisted and 'small'.  They tend to be way too odd to wear.  The fabric/molded cup bulging in places and not holding me in other places.  Not so with the all round by SpecifiXs.  This one has lift, separation and HOLDING power.  I can JOG with this bra on!  I haven't been able so jog, play ball or chase my children for so long for fear of knocking myself out for years!  LOL<br />The other bras that did not work and the reasons are below:<br /><br />SYROKAN Women's High Impact Support Wirefree Bounce Control Plus Size Workout Sports Bra Black/Grey-2 40H ~ Absolutely zero support.  Not necessarily a monoboob, but no support either.  A walk around the bedroom and I was bouncing high.  So, could never attempt a walk let alone a ""high impact"" type of workout.<br /><br />SYROKAN Women's High Impact Bounce Control Wirefree Non-Padded Full Figure Plus Size Sports Bra Carbon Dust 40H  ~  Moderate support.  Could not jog or do high impact type of workout without major bouncing.  Seams across breast did not lay flat.  No matter what I did.  You can see the bunching up under a shirt.  Not very attractive.<br /><br />Glamorise Women's Full Figure No Bounce Plus Size Camisole Wirefree Back Close Sports Bra #1066  ~  This was the first I tried on.  It was the one I expected to fit the best.  I wear Glamorise already.  Was not expecting that the band would be overly tight as all of my Glamorise are 40H.  The band was too tight and the cup was actually too generous.  Weird.<br /><br />So, the bra I was unsure about.  The one that is the loudest color being royal blue.  The one that I really felt would fail my test - is the ONLY one I will be keeping.  So glad I took a chance on that All Round by SpecifiXs!"
1.0,Shrinks length when laundered - goes from hip length to right under waist.  Hung to dry too.  Not put in dryer.
1.0,"Pros:<br />- Fits well on larger face/head<br />- Lens is very clear<br />- The tint was perfect. Not too dark or light.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Frame is flimsy. The arms and lens are very creaky.<br />- Lens are very sharp and digs into skin. When squinting or attempting to adjust the sunglasses, the sharp edges are very noticeable.<br /><br />The cons were frustrating, as I really wanted to like these glasses."
1.0,Made of grubber! Doesn't make noice. doesn’t even look the same. Small eye holes were cut out of rubber mask and you could not even see through them. Return and refund was excepted. Just frustrating.
1.0,"very nice earring but not sufficiently secured to the clasp.  the first time i wore it, the earring fell from clasp the clasp and unfortunately i didn't notice and lost the earring.  i was left with the clasp in my ear but no earring.  i only noticed it when the other earrring fell off my ear and landed in my lap.<br /> two things would make this better:  one&#34;  secure the clasp to the earring, two, add the little rubber stopper on the earring so that the clasp does not fall out of the ear.  but as looks go, it looked very attractive for the full one hour i hot to wear it."
1.0,Terrible material. So cheap. Came with sides ungluing already
1.0,Love the band colors but the pins to hold it on is to short and it only been a month and the color  is changing pissed
1.0,Honestly I couldn't even try it on due to the smell. I couldn't get it back in the package fast enough.
1.0,The description says that the socks are 100% Merino wool.  They only contain 62% wool.
1.0,"The material used for this shirt is the kind one would use for a Halloween costume. It's thin & flimsy, almost see through. I would not recommend purchasing this item. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Does not fit the charge 3
1.0,Fell apart at the seems after one wear :( hat to trash it
1.0,"Not what I expected,  poor quality"
1.0,"A little sad love the mask but it only worked for 10 minutes. Placed brand new batteries then within the same day it stop turning on. The wires appear to not have been secured enough, not other reason to explain why it would not stopping"
1.0,Very very thin cheap mask. Don't recommend.
1.0,"Multiple rivets were crooked and off center despite the description reading ""laser precision"" placement and all that other marketing hype. The stitching on both ends did not match and were uneven. The leather smelled that of chemicals not that of a true Napa leather hide. Contacted the company/owner via their email, social media, and on Amazon customer message portal. Never received a single response towards my items issues, just a good old fashioned ignore by the seller on all accounts. It's a shame when a company doesn't stand by their products and don't respect their customers."
1.0,"This item was very disappointing.  The charms look cheap, like something from a gumball machine.  Was supposed to be a gift, but couldn't give something that looked so juvenile and cheap.  Waste of money!!!"
1.0,Broke as soon as I tried to wear it
1.0,I ordered 4 and they all the straps broke after washing them on gentle cycle. Also just on one of the dresses it was super tight around the chest. Weird considering I ordered 4 of the same size. Besides that they fit amazing and looked flattering. Unfortunately they are cheaply made. Super disappointed!
1.0,I recieved the wrong dress.
1.0,The color changed before I even wear it...
1.0,These glasses don’t really help at all for night driving. Especially since they tend to distort some things and cause anything with 2ft to be slightly fuzzy.
1.0,"Broke within two days. It appears to be glued on the ends and might function as a fashion statement but, if you are going to use this as an oath ring, keep shopping."
1.0,"The pin is beautiful. But while attempting to put it on my vinyl jacket, the pin mechanism on the back snapped off. I applied very little pressure since the material of the jacket was so thin."
1.0,Runs very small and they smell.
1.0,"Mouth don't move.  Horns don't stay up.  Eye holes are too small.  Hard to put on/take off and doesn't even fit flush to face.  Facial features don't look remotely close to the picture.  The only thing that is exact is the fact that the mask is red, (not even the right shad of red). Honestly though, even if I could give it 0 stars, I wouldn't. Just because I could tear it apart and make something better when I find the time."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Would not recommend or order again!
1.0,Unfortunately this didnt work at all for me. The glove size was ok but the manageability for dishwashing was subpar at best plus I couldnt get anything clean!
1.0,I needed a dress for my daughter's  wedding I order this dress it was horrible threads should have been trimmed  it sit up really bad in front I would not order again
1.0,Time keeps stopping!
1.0,Ordered way up in size. Didn't matter because it's way too small.
1.0,Looks great.  Broke the first time it was wound.
1.0,"Scratches easily.would have expected to be a little tougher than it is.  Also the pins are insanely hard to get out, making it difficult to take out links. And a pin on the clasp is always sticking out, won't stay in.  Find a better one"
1.0,I am sending them back.  Poor quality.  They don't look like they would stand many washings.  I am very disappointed.
1.0,"After the first use of these the gear loop on the case ripped.  Soon after that, the prisms adhesive failed and they cracked while loosely rattling around in the case. I would recommend spending the extra $20 and buying a quality pair with a much larger field of view."
1.0,Wors buy ever it feels so cheap
1.0,This dress is not flattering. It looks like a grandma dress.
1.0,The right arm  is broken i. Sending back
1.0,"I dont know who these septum rings would fit except a small child. Not to mention, When i unclasped it the clasp fell off. Poorly made."
1.0,"Las peores gafas que he visto, he comprado mejores por 2 $. NO COMPRAR"
1.0,"Size was good, but the lights do not work, nor can you fix it."
1.0,Way too small and the fabric is very cheap don't waste your money.
1.0,I received a wallet not a swimsuit...
1.0,"After doing proper measurements and matching up to sizing chart, measurements are off. I bought this dress for my daughter's homecoming dance and paid for expedited shipping. It came in and she tried the dress on. It fit in most areas except for the bust. It was too big. We ordered a size 12 based on all measurements. The bust area is a poor design and doesn't have much support, big and the top part doesn't fit well. Wouldn't recommend. Tried to return and seller said it wasn't feasible to send back abd would only issue a partial refund. Had to file claim with Amazon."
1.0,so just received this today and suppose to come with cross body strap and mine is not even in it.  so it only a hand bag which defected the purpose of the purpose and upon further inspection the inside zipper already split and the inside pocket the suppose to slip the inside pockets not even attacked to the bottom of the pursue.  so if I could give this pursue a zero I would.  this a waste of money.  just another pursue going to my daughter to play with
1.0,The size chart was not true to size when receiving. They are way to small and can’t wear hen.
1.0,This was ordered as a possible Halloween costume for my daughter. This could fit her plus the rest of the track team! The photos are misleading.
1.0,"Return process is a joke, the image is not at all what you get.<br />Top is see through!"
1.0,Don't buy! Fabric is super thin and flimsy. You don't even get half of what you paid for. 😬
1.0,Turned my wrist a nasty color real nasty...I can't even wear it!
1.0,"Too small ,kids size, not for a adult"
1.0,In Garbage after 1 week
1.0,easy  to Break Sadly
1.0,It's broke in the for few hour I I wear it
1.0,"Very disappointed in this product. It's runs very small. My 13 yr old normally wears a 12 so I opted to order this vs adult XS. Regret it now. It is more like an 8-10. Also disappointed there's no returns. This isn't underwear. She tried it on for two seconds. If you need a leotard and not in a rush, you're better off ordering from Walmart. Do not order from this seller!!"
1.0,This hat is meant for a baby not a kid. My children are 7 and 8 and this is way too small for them. Also it is made from thin material too thin to be a practical hat. Disappointed as my children really wanted unspeakable merch for Christmas and this was a complete failure.
1.0,As the last reviewer stated this blouse is basically defective the piece that goes around your waist is twisted and there is no fixing it. I am utterly disappointed and wondering why this wasn’t pulled from Amazon when obviously there was a problem with more than one of them! Because of this I’ve never worn the top and it just sits in my drawers.
1.0,False Advertising! This is a long sleeve shirt and not to be worn in spring/summer unless you want to be hot!  The picture and the description is deceiving. Runs very very small. I would pass and find something else. Bummer bc it’s a cute pattern.
1.0,The stitches on ears are loose and ripped. My daughter was so excited because of the color but she saw the damaged and asked why it was broken.
1.0,"I was excited when I ordered this dress! I was very disappointed when it arrived! It does not fit well, it runs really small and it is way way too short! I would suggest at least one size up of you choose to order it!"
1.0,"Update: unfortunately, the gold peg came out of the pearl when I took them out. Tried to reinsert peg into pearl but it broke off. 😐So not as well made as I thought and hoped. They were not cheap, so I expected more...<br /><br />Love these! Took me a while to get the right size (started with 9mm, went down to 7 mm, to then settle on 8mm). They seem to be very well made - but of course now they need to stand the test of time. So far so good!"
1.0,This size &#34;5-X&#34; is barely a &#34;1-X.&#34;
1.0,First order was great the second was really tight and annoying.
1.0,These appear to be knockoffs or Nike castoffs due to quality control issues. Insole was hanging out despite stickiness on bottom. Design is different than pictured. Glue in various places. Extremely hard bottomed shoe. No bounce at all. And they arrived 4 days later than listed as expected arrival date.
1.0,"The screw keeps falling out. I bought a repair kit, but no matter what the screw will not stay in and the side keeps falling off. After replacing the screw 4 times I figured it must be too small so I used the next biggest size up but it was to big. I've decided it must be the threading and I gave up."
1.0,"I ordered a size large and the triangle top was about 2 inches in width...I'm not large on top, and it didn't cover everything it should have. Bottoms were very cheeky. I returned bc of the top."
1.0,I really like - my glasses don't fog up. Very comfortable.
1.0,Haven't even had it a month and this silver plated bracelet is RUSTING!!!! Only gave one star bc I have to... actually deserves no stars
1.0,"Bought these as a gift for my sister.  The box they came in was about 100 times larger than the earrings, with a ridiculous amount of packaging that was doing nothing to actually protect the product.  This was readily apparent, as one of the posts of the earrings was snapped off on arrival.  Low quality schlock... I wasn't expecting them to be amazing, but it would be nice if they could at least make it to the house without breaking."
1.0,Dress was not true to size a 5x seemed more like to a 2 x
1.0,"We received the tailored style shirt in the new, shiny type of fabric that you can find in COSTCO stores right now and not as expected the original Kirkland Signature traditional style in the smooth cotton fabric, We sent it back right away and received a refund without a problem."
1.0,Was hoping this would complete my Scarlet Witch costume. Got super excited when it got here only to be majorly disappointed. Seems like thick material. No damage to the box. Almost as if intentionally broke before it even got bubble wrapped.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture . Arms are way to short.  To my elbows when I tried it on.  Its super cheap feeling . Super bummed !
1.0,Not satisfiedThe material was awful the shirt was too small just do not like totally dissatisfied
1.0,"Not mens XL on the shirt I bought, barely a womens XL"
1.0,"Not as pictured.  It's like the black is printed on a weird white material.  Not cute, not like you see in boutiques.  Don't bother"
1.0,I don't like leaving bad reviews but I washed these socks ONE time on the delicate cycle with cold water and hung to air dry and they are already falling apart in pieces. Every pair has threads coming off of them. They are coming apart string by string. Very disappointing!
1.0,Size guide not accurate. Fits much smaller than indicated. Could not use
1.0,not what i expected!
1.0,Way too narrow and small! Had to send back to seller.
1.0,"Very disappointed in the off the shoulder t-shirt.  I ordered XXL because of the reviews.  It was too large, additionally it did not fit as an off the shoulder.  It fit like a regular t-shirt."
1.0,I had to punch two additional holes for it to work right.  Buy one that is one or two sizes larger than your waist. I did and it was still to small.
1.0,Very disappointed in this bra.  There was no support at all with this bra. I went a size up and it was very tight.
1.0,These fell apart a week after I got them
1.0,Didn't like. It fell apart
1.0,"Poor quality, a strap began to split right away. It is not real solid leather."
1.0,Cute but broke after using it once for a very short period of time sadly.
1.0,This was one of my favorite looking swimsuits ever. Sadly didn't fit at all and nobody's boobs are that close together
1.0,"This is a horrible looking jumpsuit , it looks cheap."
1.0,Not comfortable.  No cushion.
1.0,Too small for a XXL
1.0,Went exactly by the sizing chart but it was incorrect
1.0,Way too big. Made for a BBL body. super thin. Would not buy if I was you
1.0,It looked to big when opened and when washed this shrunk on this first wash
1.0,This is not anything like I was expecting. Please I would like to return it.
1.0,"The only positive thing I can say is this dress is tagless. When they say conforming, they mean CONFORMING. Which is fine if you're just thick-built. This is not a dress for anyone with a fupa, stomach, or backrolls. They cannot be hid in this dress. And, a word about sizing- ORDER A SIZE UP. I ordered my ""correct"" size according to inches, and this is almost like getting into a pair of spanks. Meaning, if you sit, be prepared to look like you're picking at your ass when you stand up. Lastly, DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING METAL AFTER PUTTING IT ON. The material is pure static cling, so prepare to frizz your hair. Love the price, hate the product!"
1.0,Would write no stars if I could. I'm very unhappy with this purchase and will be returning ASAP. I saw that the fit ran a bit too small- so I ordered the size that was a bit baggy but comfortable to me- and when I pulled the jumper out of the bag I was SHOCKED ON HOW SMALL an XXL sweater was! Easily the XXL sweater is comparable to a Large or Medium from stores around me.
1.0,There was no give to the slip at all like I expected. I'm used to ones that are like an elastic/spiky feel and this was very stiff. And it was really small through the hip line but very big in the waist. The length was perfect for what I needed but the fit was not good.
1.0,Very pretty but it's made for a petite person.
1.0,"Cute but not at all what I ordered. Fabric is the same but this is a spaghetti strap, smocked back, sweetheart neckline sort of deal and not the deep v wrap dress I was hoping to get based off of the description and photos. Might keep because of the price vs. hassle of returning, but just know I'm pretty disappointed."
1.0,Wanted this watch because it was mostly 'green'.  Price was okay.  Durability was an immediate issue.  After using the included sizing tool to adjust the band it began losing pins - pins I hadn't even touched during sizing.  Granted - I'm no jeweler - so I took it to one.  Was told it could be fixed for more than I paid for the watch.  Asked if I had done wrong sizing and was told the pins in the band were 'inferior' plus 'too small and too short' to support the band.
1.0,It wasn’t the quality I expected. I returned it
1.0,Doesn't do anything
1.0,Very tiny. barely  fit my pinky.
1.0,"The box said “one size” and it is not for kids, but they only fit my 11 year old guy.<br />They are for adult as they were marketed.<br />This makes it too expensive and a bad purchase. It should be bigger and they should sale it large medium and shamal instead of one size only.<br />Or disclose that it is small, now I am stuck with two tiny masks."
1.0,The XL for more like a M and the stitching around the neck was both loose in areas and scrambled in other areas. Plus the graphic wasn’t clear. My friends couldn’t even tell it was Dolly! I emailed the company and they quickly gave me a refunded and apologized for the bad experience. Wish it would have worked out.
1.0,"Only received half of the order.  This is advertised as a 2 set, only received 1."
1.0,"The photo makes this boa look fairly big and full. The mannequin in the photo is clearly about 2 1/2' tall and I suspect the photo actually has 2 or 3 boas in it. This boa is a stringy, thin mess that is losing feathers left and right. You can do better."
1.0,Fell apart 1st day crap
1.0,"It fits well in the neckline and chest, but the rest is way way too big. Feels like one big bag."
1.0,"SUPER SMALL, super thin, junk!"
1.0,"Very confusing to put on...way too small and I ordered up a size.  Sent back.  SO upset, really wanted to love this item!"
1.0,"The fit of this dress was nice, had to return because the top looked torn to design vs made to design."
1.0,The shirt has 3/4 sleeve and it’s very short not a great buy.was disappointed.
1.0,In order for this to fit my piercing would've had to be in my chin..its so big .and I have full sized lips
1.0,"Masks are very thin, spandex material. It says machine-washable, but when I washed it for the first time the threading came out. I contacted the seller who just said to handwash it and made no attempt to address the fact that they say it is machine-washable, but clearly it is not. Do NOT recommend dealing with this seller."
1.0,This product is not for a long torso. Looks like it’s made for a teenager! Very disappointed
1.0,"These were purchased to bring my order to $25 so I didn't have to pay for shipping.<br />With that in mind, I figure they cost $3-4 instead of $7.  They are worth that.<br />They are not ""good"" earrings, but if you want to play around with bigger hoops, they work for that.<br />I can take these on a trip and not worry if they get lost.<br />They meet my expectations and I have worn them."
1.0,"I ordered XXL and received a M, will give them away. It looks good"
1.0,"This necklace is a great idea for a gift but mine only has 6 rings on it and is supposed to have 7 for a 70th birthday gift. The writing inside the box says seven rings for seven decades, but is missing a ring on the necklace. I was supposed to gift this to my grandma in two days and now I’m not able to. Bummer! Do not waste your time chancing this necklace not being what it says it is."
1.0,It took over a month to receive the earrings.  The earrings changed colors after wearing the the fifth time.
1.0,This was very small and more flimsy than expected.
1.0,I’ve got biceps on the chubbier side and this dress did not fit over my arms well. Fit was weird in the bust and waist too (I’m an hourglass figure). It was loose and just off on the fit; I imagine the ties could have helped with that but unfortunately I couldn’t try them out bc of the arm fit. Return is started and I will update on the return process once completed. Oh also very very thin fabric.
1.0,"I've been buy cheap ($20-$30) sunglasses for years now.  Never understood why people spend so much on something that will get lost or damaged in less than a year.  Last year I met with a sales rep for Kore Essentials at a trade show.  He fed me a bunch of lies about how tough they are and how the company stands by their product if they break.  Well, I didn't buy the from the sales rep because they were cheaper on Amazon.  Now it's been less than a year since I bought them and the lenses are covered in scratches.  And guess what, the company won't stand by their product and replace my lenses.  Turns out the $20-$30 shades I've been buying are just as good as these.  And when they get scratched, I can buy another pair without feeling ripped off."
1.0,These are pretty good looking but they run a bit small. Very cheaply made. Fabric is separating from the waist band after the first wear. Would not recommend.
1.0,Missing 6 stones ugh! Hope I could get a refund or exchange... disappointed
1.0,I returned these immediately. These are not compression tanks and the material was horrible.
1.0,Had it for a couple of weeks and the band ripped from the metal clasp.
1.0,"My daughter loves this, if it extremely soft and comfy but everytime I wash it, it falls apart:("
1.0,product poor quality<br />not as pictured<br />too flouncy
1.0,"Biggest waste of money! Cheap material. Will not protect you if you get hot water/grease splashed on you. Also, ripped right down the crotch at the start of my shift this am. Only my 3rd time wearing them. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1.0,No se ve bien con ellos.
1.0,Wrong ugly color
1.0,This material is so so bad. It’s cheaply made and doesn’t even fit right. It bunches up in different spots and is definitely not flattering
1.0,Way to small. Only way I see you'll be able to add these onto your M Frame would be to add some oil to act as a lubricant.
1.0,The One size is really a X Small. Its beautiful!! But really not a one size
1.0,"I got to wear this once, gently washed it and the pants completely came apart. This set was so comfortable and soft, but had to throw it away."
1.0,Warning the fabric is horrible  it sticks to your body  you sweat like crazy.  If you want something to keep you cool  good cotton.  VERY DISAPPOINTING  TRUST ME
1.0,Stone feel out of ring within first week.
1.0,Bad quality material.  Disposable.
1.0,"I ordered these because I liked the color. Well, the actual item does not even faintly resemble the image, and since you have to pay postage to CHINA to send it back, you are stuck with it."
1.0,"The style is nice, but the material is way too sheer for my liking."
1.0,This is not a true to size product!!!
1.0,Too small. Very cheap material.
1.0,Ordered Medium.<br />Not the same shirt as advertised! Super bummed. Shirt also has black ink by shoulder.  And as you can see the little pumpkin is not green as advertised either.
1.0,"The mask did not stay up on the face, not made to be a mask."
1.0,So big it can fit an adult
1.0,I’m choking in this thing. It runs small and is tight all over. I was afraid an extra large would be too big but it’s tiny.
1.0,I was really exited with this purchase but I let completely disappointed because was too small. And also I waited ages for the delivery.
1.0,"This was like the polyester material from the 70s.  Very ugly, looked like you were wearing a bag with stripes :/"
1.0,Wouldn't fit
1.0,Would not buy again. Velcro falling off within just days. Stitching come out. Too cheaply made.
1.0,"Horrible, but I got what I paid for, I won't make that mistake again"
1.0,Not impressed with this bracelet at all.. The clasp doesn't function like it should and it's always loose...
1.0,My badge holder was not in the package. Not sure what to do this has never Ed happed before.
1.0,"Shoulders are small, but the bottom part is huge!"
1.0,It’s a $4.50 hat. The logo is a bit fuzzy and VERY shiny. The decal is pressed/sublimated over the seam and hat stitching. So bad. Buts it’s basically a free hat. One no one wants to wear.
1.0,"I wear a medium and this top is more like a large , quality not that great . Rethink buying this item."
1.0,First came in broken. Second broke after first night.
1.0,Sweater was ok. Seemed a lil flimsy so returned
1.0,"The fabric arrived so wrinkled that it was almost impossible to figure out what type of garment this was.  Turns out it didn't matter, since the button holes are too small for the buttons.  Returning."
1.0,"Terrible product. I paid for 4 articles of clothing (boxer-briefs) in a size medium. Instead, I received 2 size mediums and 2 size smalls. On top of this, I have worn each size medium boxer briefs and each of them came apart and are now unwearable after 1 use. Poorly made. I feel ripped off. NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER."
1.0,Poorly made not worth the money
1.0,Cheap broke within two days hard clasp
1.0,"The dress was wonderful and the print was also better than expected, however the pocket had a hole on the inside and the zipper was broken. Unfortunately I will be returning this item."
1.0,I thought they were real lol. They are all fake and the packaging was horroble. They were all spread arround the bag. I threw them away
1.0,Horrible did not like the quality and its see through
1.0,U Asians are a discrete to man kind
1.0,Entirely too small.
1.0,The material is as expected but the XL fits more like a medium.
1.0,"These are wayyyy too small for curvy women. I’m 5 5 160 and large was too right on hips. Quality is great tho, and the glow in the dark bones are very bright! Gonna try and XL"
1.0,I ordered 2 pair of these because of the price and I threw them right in the trash when they got here. Terribly cheap. Do not buy
1.0,Don't buy this frock.
1.0,This is so rediculous. I got the XL because I read the reviews and it fits like a small. I’m 5’4” 140 lbs and I normally wear a small but I wanted it to be like the picture. To actually get it for fall off the shoulder and be slouchy they would have to offer a size 5XL. Nuts
1.0,Do not buy! Too cheap of a material even as a toy a kid wont even appreciate
1.0,Shirt was different style than pictured. More fitted women’s shirt than a T-shirt.
1.0,These for horrible! Would not recommend.
1.0,"Built in light doesn't work. When I contacted Casio they wanted me to spend a bunch of time sending the stupid thing in for repairs. It's a cheap watch, why not just send me a new one ?"
1.0,The case was too small it was cute that's it not one pair of shades that I had feat not even reading glasses
1.0,Super excited to finally receive theses today...then I opened them!!! :( The dangling part of the earring is just like the pictures! Beautiful!!! The earring part that actually goes through/in your ear piercing is tarnished and nasty looking!!! Looks like I’d need a tetanus shot before/after wearing them. Sad!!! Had these earrings in my shopping cart for a while...hesitant and now I know why. Huge disappointment!!!!
1.0,These don’t stay up all all. You get what you pay for.
1.0,I ordered this as a size large and it was deff a size small.. The pant are suppose to be flowing and they r tight... The cut was wayy of in the crotch area.. Even with the pants up to my waist the crotch was so awkward no matter how i tried to wear them... These are not like normal harem pants at all!
1.0,"The sweater was extremely small and their was not the hint of a dolman sleeve. This sweater was a total disappointment, I have bought this brand from Macy’s before and it did not ever disappoint. Also, the sweater I received was a return/used. I returned the sweater."
1.0,Completely off the word margarita letters go from one ear to the other no one could ever read it and the rest is so far down the neck you can't read. Waste of money
1.0,"once you adjust the belt and click it on, minutes later the belt loosens, and it's a pain to adjust with it on... not worth it"
1.0,"Bought these gloves for my husband based on other reviews for keeping hands warm in cold temperatures. Not so much, save your money. In 30 degree weather, his hands still got cold. The one positive thing, they fit well and look good, but don't buy them for warmth."
1.0,2 layer face mask. The fabric is very thin and you can see through mask clearly when held up to light. Will not protect from germs. If you are getting this as part of a costume this would be fine. I would NOT expect any protection from dust or germs with this though.
1.0,"3 of the 5 pants ripped within a few hours after putting them on just doing daily activities and sitting around the house, no exercising, running etc."
1.0,"From Mrs. Martinoff:  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Don't waste your time or money."
1.0,"After waiting over a month to receive, I was very ticked that I took it out of the package today & it immediately fell apart. The clip came off the side of it - the whole reason I bought 2 of these hard cases was for my kids' backpacks & now he can't even attach it! This one was also not symmetrical, very misshapen. Cheap price = cheap quality here & not worth the trouble to return or wait another month for another one, so I will be trying hot glue to fix it."
1.0,Too small it is like a children size.
1.0,DO NOT BUY THEM THEY COME APART IN A HEARTBEAT!!!
1.0,Will not stay on my child’s face at all
1.0,Cheapest feeling ever.
1.0,was too big and I usually wear a medium in this type of blouse but small is too big AND there's a stan on the collar that won't come out.
1.0,I bought for a coworker and was so embarrassed when she opened them and they were both broke and the metal was super cheap she threw them away right in front of me
1.0,Came with a hole in it 🙄
1.0,"The material, the sizing the quality all was a miss"
1.0,Not able to wear big on top with a small waist that my 7 year old fits - ordered a xxxl
1.0,"The item looks nothing like in the pics. It came with a completely different pink colour than what it looks in the site. and the strap is much narrower in some places, which it doesnt show or written in the site. please return the money."
1.0,"I just received these unisex head/face band and was very disappointed. Though the product is light-weighted, not very supportable if using as a face mask. Unless you have a very full face, it will keep slipping down. I won’t purchase this product again,"
1.0,"flimsy, gave as gift, did not fit.  Sizes are smaller then most."
1.0,Not sized right. Looks like a maternity shirt
1.0,Made way toooooo small buy two sizes bigger
1.0,"Odd buckle: it pivots in the middle, so it can only open a few degrees while it is still on you.  Suck in your gut when you take these off, people!"
1.0,"The 2xl is the size of a medium, the worst waste of money and time"
1.0,Hard to connect
1.0,Way smaller and cheaper and uglier than the advertised picture.
1.0,Tiny. didnt even make it out of the lacings
1.0,My stone fell out somewhere during my first wearing of them.
1.0,Glasses arrived warped. Slanted right lens.
1.0,Earrings are not real silver. They are silver plated or coated and have started peeling. Such a travesty! Amazon should block this vendor or atleast revise their advertisement practices.
1.0,Way to small.  I ordered a XL to be safe ~ it fit as a Small.  :(
1.0,Very cheap material. Feels like paper and potato sack.
1.0,"Bought a size 18 months, looked like doll clothing when I opened the package. My 12 month old nephew couldn't get one arm into it"
1.0,I have small earlobes that don’t support large or heavy earrings so I thought these would give support but not at all. Too bad. Had high hopes
1.0,I bought this for Halloween and it fell of an nrok after an hour. The kind of cord they use for ting it comes undone very easy and it pulls it knots with it's weight. I couldn't keep it in place for that hour either. Maybe an interesting decoration but definitely not a mask
1.0,Very ill-fitting. Super loose and material is weird and uncomfortable.
1.0,I didn't expect this to be perfect but it is so thin and you can see through it. It definitely is not made well. I would not recommend buying this. Spend a bit more and get something well made. Oh and the size runs small.
1.0,This is too small for a XL
1.0,"I love the look of this top and almost ordered it.  However, the correct pattern of black keys on a piano is 2 - 3- 2- 3 etc.  I am a music teacher and would not be able to use this top because of this  I am so disappointed since this was the musical top that I have liked the most.  Perhaps they will make the correction and resell in the future."
1.0,"So I thought with it being advertised as “magnet” style, I had assumed like the many other newish accessories that really work with the magnetic abilities of the iPhone 12/13s .. like, I didn’t think it would need an extra sticky part just like a regular similar brand kind.<br /><br />I was still not too bothered by that mixup, although it seemed like the magnet capabilities is simply a gimmick more than anything.<br /><br />I ended up having to fully reduce my satisfaction to one star after this phone grip<br />melted apart…I will say I placed it ontop of my car for all of 6 minutes. Not the best idea, but still. It shouldn’t have melted into nothingness (not literally nothingness, but melted to unusable) in such a short time frame.<br /><br />To me that further speaks of the lack of quality, unfortunately.<br /><br />But like truly , it’s just an off brand phone grip -with the 3M sticky- with a slight, very slight magnetic pull that I can’t see what it could actually be used for, which out much of any magnetic strength.<br /><br />It’s a good idea though, but I can’t recommend this particular item at this time."
1.0,Poorly made. Seams are on outside. Do not like at all
1.0,This is unacceptable. I don’t know if this was just a big mistake or if it’s supposed to be this way but it’s not holding onto me at all. Will definitely be returning!
1.0,Disappointed that the wrong size was sent. It's a beautiful suit so I will have to reorder.
1.0,Didn’t even come close to my size even though the label said it was.
1.0,"The pockets were not completely stitched together.  No one can place anything in the pockets because whatever item you put in the pocket, it will fall to the floor or completely thru the pants legs.  Very disappointed with this pair unfortunately…."
1.0,The hands in the watch fell off . That's very poor .
1.0,Product received does not match the images.
1.0,I was expecting this dress to be the same as DB Moon dresses. It is not. It is too wide/big but also too short. The material isn’t soft like DB Moon dresses. Disappointed.
1.0,It’s a lot longer then expected
1.0,"Very disappointed in this product, very cheap. never even got a chance to wear it. I hand washed it for the first time and this what happened"
1.0,"Don’t buy,worst product"
1.0,Says acrylic but they're just really cheap plastic. They get stuck and they don't fit properly  if I would have known they were like this I wouldn't have bought them. Ordered better  gauges from Spencer online. More expensive but wah better quality
1.0,Really cute earring BUT both fell apart with in 5 minutes of me opening the box and touching them..... don’t waste your time unless you are going to glue them back together. See pics
1.0,"I ordered a size medium since the size chart stated a medium was similar to a size 7 or 8.  When I opened it it looked very tiny, and looking at the t-shirt tag it says it’s a girls size 5!!! Their sizing seems to be way off! In addition I paid an extra $5 for a medium because I though that’s what would fit my daughter and the other sizes were $9.95 compared to the $14.95 i paid.  Very disappointed & bummed! 😢 Graphics are also sub par and a bit blurry.  Wondering if this is a knock off from China, with a US price!"
1.0,"The watch band doesn’t fit the versa watch and band pin missing,"
1.0,"Not happy with the quality, size not correct. I wish to return it."
1.0,Product was falling apart on arrival and not at all when was in the product description. Looked like someone had cut broom bristles and taped them together with a button.
1.0,Garbadge
1.0,This lasted one day before the clasp broke.
1.0,Terrible quality. Not soft and very unflattering cut.
1.0,"L fits like a S on me, my usual jean size is 26"
1.0,I sized up bc I know these things can run differently and the coverup skirt did not even fit halfway around my waist. I wear a 6/8 and bought a large…
1.0,This dress is nothing like the picture. It’s actually short and you would need to wear shorts or leggings underneath it. It literally shows all my business smh
1.0,"I received a similar dress without a slit, and the stitching and cut of the dress did not match the picture.  I returned this item for a refund."
1.0,Not worth the money:( They fell off before I even got to the grass.
1.0,"This was a gift for my 11 year old son and I’m very disappointed. It said it was an adult size but it is way too small, it can fit my 4 year old godson. Don’t buy this item"
1.0,Cheaply made and gave it away.  Not worth the hassle to return.  Outsourcing.
1.0,Was tarnished and too big...
1.0,"I really wanted to love these. They stay on. They don’t show. But literally within 2 hours of wearing them, both socks had holes in the toes. This has happened with 2 out of 2 pairs. No- my toe nails are not too long (I cut them down thinking maybe on pair #1, it was my fault). These are not worth your money. I got these holes within 2 hours!  Socks should last longer than this!"
1.0,"It holds the AirTag well enough if you don't do anything with it. The AirTag occasionally popped out of the holder attached to the keyring while it was in my pocket.  That was disconcerting the first time it happened, then simply annoying after that. But it wasn't a problem for long because the part of the silicone holder that held it onto the keyring wore through in just a few months."
1.0,"See-through and painted pockets, not even stitched to look like real pockets"
1.0,Extremely cheap. See through and the design isn’t even the same !
1.0,Really pretty but broke the first day I used.
1.0,"Starting with the size. The chart to choose the size didn't even pop up, so they sent me a small. The fabric felt plasticky, and the hair pin was just a piece of paper poorly glued to a clip. Shinobu wears pants not a skirt. Her KIMONO is a beautiful butterfly detailed cloth with sleeves. I received a poorly made white cape. The leg covers didn't even arrive either, the image is poorly misleading and should have a picture of the actual product. I basically received a poorly made mitsuri cosplay with a butterfly pin. It wasn't surprising as there's always a catch to a ""good cosplay"" for only 50 dollars."
1.0,POS but not surprised for the price.
1.0,"Impossible to put on, couldn’t even get the clasp open. The tool provided immediately broke. This would’ve looked cute if I had been able to get it on"
1.0,4 of the 5 chairs are broken and cracked where the legs meets the seat.
1.0,Good fit but anti-fog wears out after a couple of uses. I would not recommend these goggles.
1.0,If you are very slim it will work for you only
1.0,Very thin gloves.  Every other glove ripped when trying to put them on. Cannot get through a cleaning job without having to replace the gloves because of the holes that leave my hand exposed.
1.0,Run very small in the body but very long in the sleeves. Definitely not of the quality expected of NCAA sanctioned apparel.
1.0,"The clasps don't hold well. Each time I take off or put back on the watch, I would have to resize the width again."
1.0,It wasn't the right size
1.0,Don’t waste your time/money. It’s literally a different dress than shown in the picture. There are no openings in the back or pockets. The fabric is completely different and cheap. I look like I’m in an episode of a handmaids tale……..
1.0,Was difficult to put on and off. Threw them out waisted 9$
1.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The earrings arrived broken and are cheaply made. These are not sterling silver.
1.0,Bought as a gift for someone with a small wrist.  Make sure you look at the size.<br />Very heavy and bulky.  Don't think it would be comfortable to wear.<br />Returned the watch.
1.0,Pants were see through couldn’t wear them out. Not as comfortable as the old pair i had that was cotton.
1.0,"it was like a picture I could have taken! it was blurry and bad quality. I was going to be a present for my cousin, but I sent it back."
1.0,Not for women. Cheap! I ordered by mistake. I'll be lucky if they get to my shins😑
1.0,Didn't look like the picture at all (the picture was different when i ordered it). I have never worn it. I ended up just donating it.
1.0,Didn’t fit and it was cheaply made. Plus I had to pay $29 to return it. Not worth it. Just save your money. Wish I hadn’t purchased it. Cost half of what I paid to ship it back. Worst part was that I didn’t have a return label and had to message the person to send it to me. Took a while to get the address and send it back to them.
1.0,"I previously owned a Peugot watch that I loved. It was stunning and elegant. So I ordered this one. It is cheap looking in comparison. The strap is so poorly attached to the watch that it falls off the moment you put on a sweater or brush it lightly again your desk. Furthermore, last week the battery died. This is supposedly a new watch and it does not work in a little over a month? Unfortunately, I did not return it within the 30 day limit because my life as a teacher is pretty crazy. When I did contact the seller, he suggested perhaps the wristband was too small. If anything, it is the reverse. He told me to contact Amazon directly if I wanted to return the watch, which I do. I looked all over the website to find a place to do so and could not find one. I'm hoping Amazon will read this and respond to me directly about returning this watch. Thank you."
1.0,This was a beautiful necklace but it broke the first time I tried to wear it. When I first opened it 3 pearls fell off. Very disappointed it has to go back. I did like style and look if only the quality was better.
1.0,"Fits really really small, ordered women's but fit my 8 yrs grand daughter, so really really"
1.0,These are just ok. And when I say ok-really for just lounging about in. TERRIBLE workout shorts. They ride up and roll down-I was frustrated through my whole squat workout. Not compressive AT ALL.
1.0,Just made it really bright with yellow tinge
1.0,Belt only lasted five months before separating.
1.0,These DO NOT fit the Royal Caribbean luggage tags!!!!  The tags you print are longer than the holder and not as wide as this holder!!!  My holders will be returned tomorrow!!!
1.0,2 sizes to small. Tried to send it back to swap it and it was like… you’ll have to drive 2 hours to send back something that cost you about $10. Time past and I never had the time to do it so I’m stuck with an outfit to small.
1.0,It broke in within three weeks...
1.0,I ordered a woman size 3x and it looks like a girls size 10.
1.0,I love how this bag looks and thought it would be perfect. It arrived today and I’m disappointed. The canvas is very sturdy and it’s good looking but the “pleather” straps and thin and cheap. The stitching on them is awful. The zipper to close the top of the bag keeps getting caught on the inside fabric of the bag because of how bad the stitching is on it. I’m also noting that the seams are coming apart where th zipper was stitched to the bag and the zipper itself isn’t sturdy at all. It keeps popping open. Not worth th $20.
1.0,Boots are worn out after only a few months of wear.
1.0,I was so happy when this arrived because it actually fit my phone but after only one day the zipper broke. The purse had very little in it so there was no strain on the zipper. I’m very disappointed.
1.0,These turned my ears green so I cannot wear them.
1.0,Changed batteries and still never worked.
1.0,Turned my granddaughters fingers green same day 🤬 payed to much for a ring that I could have gotten out of a bubble gum machine for a quarter 🤬
1.0,My sister in law bought it to me in Guatemala.Too expensive to return them. I am sure they would  of been great if they would of fit me.
1.0,"Wrong item all together sent to me and looks nothing like the picture. The item was even the wrong size. Such a shame, the item pictured is so cute and I'm afraid to try buying it again."
1.0,These shorts are mis-sized. The fit is more like men’s shorts but not in a good way. I LOVE J Brand jeans so these are disappointing.
1.0,"Horrible product. The earrings themselves look like good quality. Bought them for my husband but he only got to wear them 4 times before he started complaining that his ears were sore. I don’t know why, but the earrings appear to have eaten into his skin or irritated his ears enough to break the skin and cause scabbing..... after wearing only four times."
1.0,The very first day I wore this it ripped right where the pins go! So bummed .. I really wanted to wear this band.
1.0,"Too small, not soft,  too thin, and has a bad odor. I'm normally a 3x and sized up to 5x and it's still too tight! So bummed with this purchase! Especially for the price!"
1.0,"Too sheer with weird bra shelf that did not cover. The red and blue were great, fit well, this was supposed to be the same but was not. Did not realize it till return window passed."
1.0,Very cheap-looking.  There's a big seam running down the center that's very obvious. Looks like gumball machine jewelry. The chain knots and kinks upon touching it. This is a piece of junk.
1.0,I was going to buy this Nike hat but I decided to take a knee instead. I’ll never buy anything with a Nike logo again...EVER!
1.0,"Lasted two and a half months before the spring action broke, which is significantly shorter than the ones you get for free when you buy your glasses.  Not worth $10.00 -  maybe 2 or 3 including shipping."
1.0,Canvas wears out quick on these
1.0,came a week late with no tracked shipping and the quality is NOWHERE near what it looks like in the photo like... they’re not similar...its like they didn’t even TRY
1.0,I have small feet and thin ankles. I bought a size larger and could not get these on
1.0,The quality of the shirt was not as expected nor was the length.
1.0,Do not want because too cheap looking. Ugly strap
1.0,"Somehow I have ordered this jacket twice only to have a completely different jacket delivered.  Very disappointing.  On a positive note the pants are fabulous, sad I couldn’t get the whole set."
1.0,"Pretty, but 99 cent quality like. I probably will return it."
1.0,"The plastic insert tab that holds the inserts in the wallet slot on both units tore away from the inserts within 3 days of use.  If it did not cost me to return them, I would have.  I would not recommend these."
1.0,"The package arrived smashed a week later and contained only one hat, when I was under the impression it was a dozen."
1.0,Cheap knockoff - find genuine Casio replacement.
1.0,Way too small and poor quality! I want to return it.
1.0,"After only 30 days of wear by my 150lb teenager, the sole has fallen and the insoles are loose. This is a very poorly made product, but I would not recommend this purchase."
1.0,These shorts were way bigger than the shirt that arrived with them. Next time I know to go down a size in pants and keep the shirts true to size.
1.0,"The product is adorable, but it broke the first day. My daughter got it for her 7th birthday, and the glass front popped off and can't be put back on.  It's too bad, because she loved it and it is so cute."
1.0,Split alone side seam almost immediately.
1.0,Band slips out of connector.  Risks loosing watch.
1.0,This looked terrible.  I ordered larger because of what I read on other reviews.  The proportions of the jacket wouldn't have looked good at any size.  Zipper is cheap and kept getting stuck when I was trying it on. Just don't waist your time or money.
1.0,The material is rly thin- like costume thin tbh. And the little loops on the back came half broken and snapped when I tried to thread the (very small cheap ribbon) through them. It feels like soemone made a dress out of a tablecloth and added details with dollar store ribbons. Hoenstly I'm so disappointed and will be returning this.
1.0,There to small
1.0,Does not have instructions. One really long band.
1.0,The sizing on this product is crazy. The arms are way too large but the body runs small. Plus the size labeling is off. I sent it back and still got the same error. So if you order 2x they will send XL on the package.
1.0,Didn’t like how small they were.
1.0,Fit was weird.
1.0,Product is NOT what I expected. It is way smaller than shown in pictures. I am disappointed in this seeing as how I wanted this for part of a costume. And I needed it to stand out. It is as small as a nickel.
1.0,"The item looks nothing like the picture the material is  thin and runs big.,"
1.0,Flimsy not strong or thick enough.
1.0,Bad!!! Material
1.0,Broke the first time they were worn.
1.0,The color was nothing like that which was pictured. We had to run around last minute to get new suspenders because our “purple” was actually blue. So disappointed.
1.0,"It didn't look like the picture on website, and it also had some kind of writing on it which want on the original picture and tie was really for skinny person."
1.0,"Sunglasses were packed in a cloth bag<br />insiders  a plastic bag mailed in a bubble mailer. The lenses were completely shattered. So I can't say much about the actual glasses.  Amazingly the frames survived and are large.  Not bad if that's what you're looking for. However, the packaging must be improved."
1.0,"Strap was incorrectly sewn, makes bad tan lines and uncomfortable on the shoulders"
1.0,It’s not fit in the same size you got a pic if I wear a size medium so I bought the medium to medium is not fit
1.0,"I like the look of this bracelet, but it’s too big and it’s very difficult to fasten. The first one I had was easy to fasten butte fastener broke. In other words, it’s nice looking but cheaply made."
1.0,"I have sensitive skin and developed an itchy, painful rash after wearing these socks.<br />I washed and rinsed them twice trying to alleviate the itch/rash but it only diminished when I discontinued wearing the socks."
1.0,These are very poorly made<br />The wire comes out from the mask almost immediately
1.0,I bought my husband 2 pair of these glasses and both broke within a week in the exact same location. Not very sturdy.
1.0,"Very short, don't look like the picture"
1.0,The metal is very flimsy.
1.0,Shirt was to big. Very dissatisfied
1.0,"My two year pretty much WRECKED these after ONE DAY of wearing them! I mean literally ran a hole into both shoes! Pretty PO’d and surprised at the speed in which these got worn down - had previously purchased two pairs that lasted until she outgrew them, so figure this was a safe bet.<br /><br />Definitely a miscalculation on my part.<br /><br />My kid is hard on shoes, so I buy shoes frequently..this by far the biggest waste of money so far...I at least get a month out of the little 5.00 Walmart shoes, which I noted are cut slightly bigger than these."
1.0,This was way to small for a 2x.
1.0,needs to be ironed before worn. stiff fabric
1.0,"Straight up and down, stiff fabric and way too small. Might fit a mannequin with no shape. Ordered two different sizes. Threw both in the trash."
1.0,I ordered xl ... got a 3xl according to the tag and I swear it was at best a large... couldn’t really fold my arms ... it was so tight
1.0,By the time I took it out of the package all the beads were falling off.
1.0,"Writing this review for my wife. Pictures are misleading, quality is lacking. The floral print is not as vibrant as pictured, and they are awkwardly sized."
1.0,"The hoops are a lot thicker than pictured, meaning they are much harder to get around cartilage or ear lobes like other 10 mm hoops. From the picture I thought these would be easy clasp rings, considering they are described as being for ear, nose or lip. I bought these with the intention of using as an easy clasp nose ring. Trust me when I say it is next to impossible to shove your fingers up your nose far enough to get this to clasp. So, I decided to use these on my cartilage piercings instead. It wasn't happening. In fact, after becoming frustrated and attempting to practice clasping the earrings together in my hand to figure out HOW they were supposed to clasp first, I found I couldn't even get the hinged part into place at all by hand. I had to use pliers. So unless, you have four hands, a pair of pliers, a friend with good eyesight, and a lot of good fortune, these hoops may not be for you. These are so impossible to clasp that I find it next to impossible to believe the other reviews on this are real, and if they are that these earrings are the same as the ones they had received."
1.0,"Thin material, no tummy support (the elastic in only 1” width)."
1.0,"So tiny. Please write that in your description, not just measurements.  Worthless."
1.0,"I love these types of fits, however, I'm really tall and it was still not above the ankle"
1.0,I guess you get what you pay for.... Not with it. I purchased a medium size and received an xxL
1.0,Ordered XL based on other reviews. Too tight in chest. Wear 44DDD
1.0,This item is cheaply made.  The clasp is two magnets that are not strong and will not hold together.  You can't return it either because of the no return policy.  I went back and looked at the description and it does not state that the item can not be returned.
1.0,"Great idea, but impossible to use, run really big"
1.0,"Very tight through stomach, and sleeves."
1.0,These pants looked and felt like cheap jeans and the button hole was not cut out.
1.0,"The color was more orange than the photo, but still pretty. This dress fit perfectly when I bought it. I wore it for a wedding party and was great. I washed it one time on gentle, cold and hung it up to dry. It is now barely a shirt and tight everywhere. Price is too good to be true, you are better off spending more on something that will last more than one wear!!"
1.0,Sized wayyyy smaller than the size I ordered. Very cute junk.
1.0,Color came off after a couple wears. Zero stars if possible. Very disappointing.
1.0,"Its a gorgeous piece but after owning it for only a couple of days it eventually broke. Its hard to put the hook on the circle, and it completely broke."
1.0,Didn’t come with ankle bracelet
1.0,"Items are not like the vendor described; not packaged individually. Also, the masks have an odor that is not safe enough to wear immediately."
1.0,Very small and the material is very poor
1.0,Unable to type on screen with the gloves. Warmth yes but don’t expect to type on anything with these type of gloves
1.0,Not worth your money<br />Broken and useless goggles
1.0,Awful cheep product and the seller refuses return or full refund
1.0,"The band is NOT sterling silver!! Perhaps sterling plated. After wearing for a month the underside of the band turned copper! The rest of the band is slowly wearing & copper is showing through. The stone looks & feels like plastic, & when I received the ring (about 5 months ago), one side of the setting is loose, so the stone moves a bit. I gave it 1 star because it arrived early & the stone hasn't fallen out yet. And they've lowered the price. I'm very disappointed that I wasted nearly $30 of my birthday money on a piece of junky children's jewelry that was a birthday gift for myself."
1.0,":( I bought this sandals in January.  I only used them for inside the house, not really heavy walking or anything. Today the toe part broke, just like some other reviews mentioned.  I am soooooo disappointed, i really liked my sandals but the price tag for not even a year it's not fair at all."
1.0,Super low quality the zippers broke after the 1st use
1.0,Didn't fit as shown in the picture ! Way too small and I ordered an XL
1.0,They claim that these briefs stay put and don’t ride up but they definitely do ride up. They are always a lot shorter in length then they appear in the pictures.
1.0,"The item I ordered said ""TWBB 3 Pack Face Cloth Cover Washable Reusable Dust Cotton Mouth for Adult Men Women,Black"". The item I received was marked ""child size"". Ridiculous!"
1.0,"JUST GOT THIS CHAIN PER UPS...I WAS HAPPY,,THEN I OPENED THE BOX AND THE CHAIN WAS BROKEN !! IT WAS SEPERATED AT THE CLASP CONNECTION CONE...CHAIN WAS TO BE CONNECTED INTO THE CONE AT THE CLASP...I GOT A CHAIN THAT WAS NOT CONNECTED JUST A HOLE WHERE THE CHAIN WAS TO GO INTO  TO CONNECT CHAIN...DAMN !!!!! AGAIN THERE WAS AN ADVERTISEMENT PER AMAZON, WITH A GOOD DISCOUNT ON THE PRODUCT,,,SO I BUY,,,AND THEN AGAIN GET SCREWED...THE LAST CHAIN I BOUGHT WITH THE HIGH SHIPPNG WAS DEFECTIVE...THE CROSS I BOUGHT WAS DEFECTIVE,,,REFER TO MY REVIEW,,,IF YOU REFER TO MY SALES, I HAVE SPENT ALOT OF FUND'S WITH YOUR FIRM,,,NOW AS A 20YR. VET OF BROADCASTING, I AM COMPELED TO STOP THIS ABUSE OF AMAZON AS TO IT'S CLIENTS..YOU SAY YOU HOLD YOUR CLIENT'S TO HIGH STAND'S...THAT'S B.S. I WILL NO LONGER USE YOUR FIRM, AND WILL CREATE A WEBSITE TO DEFER YOUR FIRM,,"
1.0,"Bought to use as a vivid mask. Material is very thin. Top and bottom is not hemmed, just a cut piece of fabric sewn together"
1.0,The magnets would not hold at all. Even on people with thinner earlobe.
1.0,very poor quality of this fabric
1.0,Would like to give no stars!<br />Leather peeling in many places.  Poor poor quality!  Very disappointed.  My first and last order from this person.<br /><br />Save yourself trouble and disappointment. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE!!
1.0,Turned green within one day.
1.0,Emblem was embroiled on a camo piece of material. I was look for an individual patch.
1.0,"Sent back, the back hem was around 2 inches longer than the front."
1.0,"Did not fit had to return plus it smelled like glue and the emblem is more a cheap sticker. Not worth 18 bucks, worth more like 5$"
1.0,I order extra large and fit a medium person so upset will never order from them
1.0,We ordered a pack of 40 and won't be able to use most of them. They came deformed and deflated from packing and they are not fixable.
1.0,The nose piecearea is WAY too wide....They fall off my face and I'm super disappointed.  I would not purchase again.
1.0,Only like about this hat was that it is black! Too many creases and Folds to serve the purpose of a structured casual hat! Worst purchase ever! Will never ever buy it again because it comes rolled/ folded up in a plastic bag!
1.0,I suggest you order a size 3 times bigger than you wear.
1.0,After wearing them a few times the sole is detaching from the rest of the shoe-
1.0,"Can't.wear,can't.exchange---USELESS!!!!!"
1.0,LOOKS GOOD BUT mail wrong size to me .
1.0,This brand runs very small.  Had to send it back.
1.0,I received this anklet today and within 4 hours it broke to pieces. Very cheap. Do not waste your money!
1.0,"Poor quality, which is surprising for a Timberland product . Gloves started to pill within days."
1.0,Isn't true to size
1.0,These socks aren’t wool and do not work in temp that the advertised also they shrink up to just over ankle size... DO Not Buy to keep ur feet warm
1.0,"Don't order this jacket,  it say 💭 women,  but it for a toddler. Way too small.  Besides this product took 5 months to get here."
1.0,"Ugly and WAY TOO BIG! They looked like something a homeless person would wear, and were seriously oversized even though I ordered a small (I'm 5'1.5&#34; and 110 lbs). I returned them for a refund."
1.0,"My husband loved this sweater and did wear it a number of times, but considering how delicately I laundered it and the fact that it’s been five weeks makes it a bit ridiculous that it’s already falling apart. Of course the return window JUST closed, so now we’re stuck with a shoddy sweater. We’re both really disappointed."
1.0,It is not a size 12 ring. It is probably a 7.
1.0,Did not last past 3 days
1.0,"there is nothing good about this band, it doesn't adjust enough to fit even my small wrists so I can't use it at all"
1.0,Nope. Not this one.
1.0,These slippers are super thin like paper. I wanted these to give to the people during the party so they can take off their heels if they got tired!
1.0,"I never write reviews, but the picture for these earrings is quite misleading. They don't look at all like the ones in the picture. They're totally dull and lifeless. The price was cheap; I'll grant that. But they look like they came from the 99cent store. Nope, that's too generous. They look like the kind of earrings that come in a 10-pack at the dollar store.<br /><br />Incidentally, they threw an extra pair of black studs in my package as well. They're equally as cheap looking as the blue studs. Not at all worth the shipping charge."
1.0,I ordered these socks because they said they were seamless they are not seamless at all so I spent $14 on a pair of socks that are uncomfortable. The same goes right across the toes so don’t advertise them is be seamless if they’re not completely. I’ll probably end up using this dust cloths because I can’t stand the seam across the toes. I gave it one star rating mainly because I couldn’t give it no stars or half a star but it doesn’t even deserve the one.
1.0,Sheds worse than a dog
1.0,Item is cracked and unusable
1.0,"The material was stiff ,see through. Felt terrible on.."
1.0,Xlarge way too small for my size 10.  Definitely not sized property.  Returned
1.0,Love the shirt with the exception of the white elastic button holders. They show up too much. I will need to change them.
1.0,I would never normally but a dress like this on line let alone from Amazon. However the reviews were so good I thought I’d give it a go.<br /><br />It’s a super clingy dress which isn’t at all flattering. Think even if I’d have gone a size up I wouldn’t have kept it.
1.0,I am disappointed in the look and feel and will probably never wear it. It looks and feels cheap.
1.0,"The color very nice the Material ok too ,but the size very bad way to small  ,I saw in the reviews that size was a lot smaller but it is way to small I ordered all most 2 sizes bigger and it still didn't fix I was not happy and thru it out so I am not happy ! I think if they made the right sizes it would be a good robe . P.S. I ordered a 3xl that is the highest they go !!!"
1.0,"These are not fleece sweat pants, and there is no cotton in the weird, scratchy material. I think it may be all polyester. They look like an old t-shirt. Mine came dirty with the tag pinned on so someone else must have worn them then sent them back."
1.0,Sleeves were like bell bottom pant legs. And material was very thin and scratchy.
1.0,"Very thin & weak material, will never last repeated training & washing. Returned."
1.0,The photo for this dress must be from a catalog unrelated to the seller. What you get a is a bunch of cheap material that is embarrassing and unflattering. Save your money.
1.0,Bad quality. Did not last long before loose threads started appearing and a hem came undone.
1.0,"These are NOT all Christmas charms.  Out of 66 charms, there are 3 ghost charms and 12 Halloween mask charms.  Also 4 of the snowflake charms are broken.  So, out of 66 charms, 19 of them I cannot use.  This is a waste of money, any way you look at it."
1.0,I paid for two and only received one
1.0,They are not hypoallergenic.
1.0,Very cheap looking - chiffon type material and the color is very pink.
1.0,Do not carry anything other than the lightest items in these bags.  The bottom ripped out of the green one on first use.
1.0,This anklet lasted exactly 1 day.
1.0,Discolored in front of dress
1.0,"The material was amazing, sparkly and vibrant unfortunately the dimensions were all wrong. The waist was small and the rest of the skirt was XXL.<br />It looked ridiculous. I tried it on for a few friends and they laughed and demanded i return it immediately. I'm so sad this skirt isn't as described.<br />I hope they can make some adjustments to their product."
1.0,"The gem fell out a after just a few times wearing it! :(  Sad, because it was very pretty."
1.0,Nice looking bracelet but it broke the first day.
1.0,Very undersized. Buy 1-2 sizes up.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY IT!!  The instructions are non-specific, have no necessary diagrams and are virtually useless. You waste a lot of the fasteners trying to get the infernal thing to work, and when you finally do fasten a button, it's loose and easy to pull off.  What a waste of money."
1.0,"Very cheap looking, not good enough to wear outside"
1.0,I normally wear a large. It said to order up. I ordered a 2XL and it was still tight. REALLY?
1.0,Returning!!! Awful fit. tiny neck hole. Tight on top huge on the bottom.. the pink is a bubble gum color not like the picture..
1.0,"The material is too tight, I can’t fit my earring in, I thought it would be more like soft silicone, but its more like plastic."
1.0,The legs fit great. The waste is 3 sizes too small
1.0,Colors are horrible and they extremely tiny
1.0,stopped working after 1 month.  Hard to hand wind.  POS
1.0,"While this product was the color and material I expected. The sizing was dramatically incorrect. I ordered a size six for my six year old and he is consistently true to a size six. They were at LEAST three sizes too big. Maybe even four. Further, when I immediately checked the tag to see if there was a mistake, all writing was in a foreign language. I cannot even figure out if the wrong size was mistakenly sent or if what they are calling a six is just huge."
1.0,This item was too small.  I don't think it is 16g because I am wearing 16g and it's thicker.
1.0,these broke the first time wore them. the clip snapped off and can not be fixed.<br /><br />a waste of money!
1.0,I don't know.  I could not get it on.
1.0,This necklace does not look like the picture! The hook is not connected at the 2 ends! It is just connected through the top of the hook. It looks much nicer in the picture than in person. It is not what the picture looks like!
1.0,They seemed very cheaply made. The leather was so thin I was sure they'd rip. I'm writing in past tense because I returned them.
1.0,These ripped at the crotch and the seams busted within about 10 times of wearing them.
1.0,"Got this to hold the cards I don't use much, have a money clip that holds 5 credit cards, so this didn't get much use, still after a month one of the bungee cords broke, about a month later the other one broke, so then I had to be careful when I opened it the cards didn't fall out. Then the clasp broke and it wouldn't stay closed. Got this on the good reviews I read, maybe I got a bad one, don't know, but I won't get another one. Got a Shark works great, doesn't hold as many cards but if fits the bill for me."
1.0,I size up to a large and felt like I was wearing smothering Spanx. Material was cheap and I’m pretty sure if I would have sat down I would have ripped the dress. I returned immediately.
1.0,Cheap looking and feeling.
1.0,Analog hands didn't even work.
1.0,"This is the worst luggage I have ever purchased !!!! The luggage fell apart after our first 1 hour flight.  We had to carry the largest one onto the ship because the wheels were so badly damaged and the whole side came apart. The next size down luggage did not make it off the ship without the wheels breaking and the whole frame being bent.  I bought this set of luggage a little more than a month prior to our trip and by the time we got back from using it for the first time, the warranty was gone.  Don't waste your money on this cheap set of luggage.  We had to buy a new set of luggage while on our trip just to get our belongings home........."
1.0,They are so small the belts aren’t even close to touching around my SLIM upper waist. Discouraging. These are definitely for children/junior miss.
1.0,They weren't the same thing as the picture was and I can't find them all because I opened them to see if I could make them work so I'm out 25$ so what
1.0,Very see through and run small. Don’t waste your money
1.0,"Very disappointed with this seller, item it’s NOT the product described or shown in the pics, BEWARE! I’ve returned the item for a refund. Also not a fan of the magnet"
1.0,poor fit - and very cheap.
1.0,"I was really pretty disappointed. First of all, it took like three weeks to get here and I tried to cancel several times. To no avail. Second of all, it was cheap and thin and I was embarrassed to give it to my ex as a Father’s Day present. But I did anyway. It was too much of a pain to return."
1.0,I highly disliked this item. I have C cup breasts which are generally perky and just wanted something to go bra-less so to say because of back  cut outs. The item made my boobs like weird blobs in my dress and ended up actually going bra-less! Waste of money but didn’t go through the hassle of returning.
1.0,One of the clips broke into three pieces on the very first use. I see no options in the listing to contact the merchant.
1.0,It does not look as nice in real life as it does in the photo. The waist line was very high and looked very awkward
1.0,"Very cute, but runs way too small."
1.0,One quit working at about 5 weeks after receiving it.
1.0,Such thin material that the posts bent and the back of the earrings and the unicorns were digging into my daughter's ears causing a terrible infection. The back of her ears were starting to grow over the back of the earrings and it took over a week to heal.
1.0,"I wasn't paying attention and missed that this is a romper. However, that isn't why I gave this 1 star. It had a horrible smell and felt like a fabric softener dryer sheet. It was cheap so I didn't bother returning it."
1.0,The fur sheds like crazy!  I put my foot inside the shoe and after I take it out half of the fur inside is stuck to my sock
1.0,This dress is very cute but the sleeves are so scratchy and uncomfortable that I returned it
1.0,"It looks cute in the pics but NOT in person.  It is not flattering nor cute in person.  Doesnt look like same dress.  Took forever to order and there is NO WAY TO RETURN IT.  By the time it arrives, the return option is gone."
1.0,Horrible! Don’t buy! The fabric is and looks cheap. Just like a cheap and thin flannel fabric. Just don’t waste your time and money.
1.0,"Thin material, big gold zipper showing in the back, I'm 5'1 135 ordered a small and a little big, seems coming undone, very cheaply made, green is muted not as bright"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1ce8c8dacd28d077021d23c0191af71a]] Wore them for the third time today and already busting apart. Very unhappy and won’t recommend anybody buy
1.0,The straps at the top were bulky and the stitching was off so the straps kind of twist which looks weird and also makes the shirt hang oddly on the body. The shirt is boxy and has no shape. I tried to make it work a billion ways but it’s just not even comfortable and thus not worth looking ugly
1.0,"This lanyard is extremely narrow. The material is nice, but it is very narrow.  Also, the mechanism at the bottom is not as pictured.  it is a clip with a little loop of string rather than the lobster claw shown.  I am returning this."
1.0,"Fabric very bad condition , not worse for the price"
1.0,Shirt is to small.
1.0,"Two arrived broke, ordered clear and received purple."
1.0,expeted this to be somewhat loose fitting.  I ordered
1.0,Cheap. Earring broke as I tried it on.
1.0,Cracked within a week. Terrible quality!
1.0,"Product was broken when I recieved it. The ""crystal "" is plastic and this is not at all what I expected! Feels like I ordered from wish instead of Amazon."
1.0,"The glasses were broken when I received them.  While I could glue the crack, one of the lenses was out and will not go back into the slot.  Poorly made and a waste of money."
1.0,The first earring broke/became unattached within 10 minutes of wearing it and then in the car the second one broke. It wasn’t even on my ear for 60 minutes!
1.0,Did not like. Earrings tarnished in less then a week. Was very disappointed. Thought this would be somewhere to buy Sterling silver. Don't want to try again . I feel one star is not worth it.
1.0,"Bought this for my husband. The band is fine, but the pin keeps falling out. He’s fixed it a number of times. Today, he lost the pin and now the band is useless. Disappointing."
1.0,"Looks black...mine came grey. Way small, little kid size but super long so logo is rolled up around adams apple. Thumbs down for an adult"
1.0,"When I received it, it was missing the ball to close it. Can't even wear it"
1.0,Not thick. More of a lightweight jacket. Cheap zipper and cheap quality. There are better flight jackets out there. Pass on this one. I returned this without hesitation.
1.0,This mask was horrible. The light up feature did not work. Kept blinking as if there were a short in the wire then stopped working.
1.0,It fits too small which is usually not a big deal if it has any stretch to the fabric but it does not have any stretchiness whatsoever. Would not buy again. Does not have the sleep wear comfortable feel your hoping for.
1.0,"The material was so thin/sheer and clingy, you could see my underwear, and panty lines. It was so low cut that all of my bras peaked out.  Returned."
1.0,This thing looks cool until you put it on.  The eyes are not even close g the o being useful….to see out.  Waste of money
1.0,"Very thin, not even a coat it was a jacket. Im returning it"
1.0,"I have not used it a few time ,<br />Carbon pieces fell and lost."
1.0,Inaccurate description compared to what was sent!
1.0,"I love how they make these look so cute on the models. At 53, I think this looks like a suit for a 73 year old. It really is ugly. And the leg openings are like grandma panties. Not for the younger set in my opinion!"
1.0,Band will not stay connected at the face or the other end.
1.0,Received this item 3 days ago and there is a large tear in the seam by the left pocket.
1.0,Definitely not what was ordered totally different than the picture! This stuff comes from China so make sure you’re washing it if you order it it’s kind of crap but considering everything that’s going on I suppose it’s better than nothing. I paid $10 Monday now they’re charging 37 be careful
1.0,No me gustaron que solo se ve el diseño de un lado y del otro nada y si se nota
1.0,No. It did not fit. The size i ordered is what I wear and it was to small.
1.0,I ended up giving it away if it is too tight and I did not like the material
1.0,Don't waste your time! Looks nice but in 2 weeks my necklace faded and it turned brown and the &#34;platinum&#34; coating wore off... Big rip off
1.0,"Made me ill within 15 minutes of trying them on - not sure what chemicals are used in the manufacture, but feels like pesticide poisoning"
1.0,"I'm 5'8"" and this was more of a blouse than a dress on me."
1.0,Could not get these to work. Don’t know if problem was on my end. Would have liked to see these working.  Need some product to help keep feet warm/hot when it’s cold
1.0,These do not fit
1.0,The product was very heavy and couldn’t fit on the charger base
1.0,This sweatshirt is a huge disappointment. It is cheap looking and very flimsy. I bought it for gifting to my sister and cannot give it to her as it is very cheap and nasty looking.
1.0,"Shipping service was good. The description is a lie, it is not genuine leather. Very disappointed. Don't buy."
1.0,"Please do not encourage this seller. They are an insult. The letter that accompanied them begging for a 5 star rating makes me feel bad, but I owe it to the readers to be honest. They are not  worth buying."
1.0,i got the product broken. they sent me another one but i hated it. bad quality
1.0,This the worst dress. The dress needs another layer inside. The sequence was prickly from the inside extremely uncomfortable.
1.0,"The material is not comfy and not stretchy at all.  Not for one size as stated.  It is almost a material that is like a think paper towel, cotton feeling."
1.0,"Wish I read the review about the rubber things falling off, I had the same issue and just took them off and aging not as kewl with out them.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />I have now have the earing for sometime with the rubber bits falling off and now the back of one earing post it was loose and have now disappeared to the land below. I won't be back to purchase any more items from this company."
1.0,The band broke in only 29 days.  Material to thin where the strap goes through the opening to tighten strap.
1.0,I was very excited to get this wallet because at 30 dollars it was going to be a great deal. The problem was that when the wallet arrived it did not have a cute baby picture in it or the 200 USD that was supposed to be in there! FALSE ADVERTISING
1.0,Really didn’t like this outfit. Runs small with ppl with breast. But the color is amazing
1.0,Bought 2 of these both broke within a month. Not durable
1.0,"When I purchased it was indicated to be a 20 guage, what showed up was a 16 guage."
1.0,Tarnished right out of the box. Garbage
1.0,It was cheap and thin. It didn't fit like in the photo. I donated it.
1.0,Cheap material and it runs small.
1.0,Cap was made of thin inferior material.
1.0,Literally just received this and I was super excited because I travel a lot for work and I thought that these would be excellent to help organize my suitcase. I'm leaving for Boulder on Sunday so I was glad I could get the free same day delivery. I opened up the package and found that one of the pouches has loose stitching and the zipper is broken. I really looked forward to using there but I guess I'll have to send them back. Probably not even going to replace them.
1.0,The ring was nice for the price but today I was out and when I got back in the car I noticed the stone fell out and of course I have no idea where it is. Not happy after spending that much for it to fall apart almost immediately.
1.0,PURE JUNK! The bow fell of with part of the belt stuck to it when I  was trying it on.  I couldn't glue back on!!! Definitely not worth a dime!!
1.0,Cheap material.. looks like a flimsy lingerie..
1.0,"The color is a true red, not burgundy as the ad said. Also it was very thin .material and not sewn well in that it hung crookedly and awkward. I am 5'5&#34; and normally wear an XL for length. I ordered a 2XL based on reviews and it fit like an XL."
1.0,"I order two sizes to see which one would fit better. One top is got a hole in the seam, The other top is stitched incorrectly, They’re was no protective tape on the bottoms, no tags. I think Both suits have been returned and resold God knows how many times"
1.0,Really short and fat leotard with HUGE leg holes. My daughter isn’t picky about her leotards fitting but this one was absolutely ridiculous. It was twice as wide as other leotard brands but also shorter girth and leg holes that would fit a 150 pound women. Definitely disappointed because the fabric is adorable.
1.0,Cute but it’s not leather. This is know for sure.
1.0,It literally fell apart as soon as my niece put it on. The zipper is so weak. All and all it’s the worst thing I’ve ever ordered on amazon and the first thing I’ve even had an issue with. I probably should of sent it back but i was so upset I tossed it right in the trash!
1.0,"Nothing like the picture. I received 1 pink, 4 gold and 15 green bands. The quality is extremely poor. Do not waste your money. The only reason it'd getting a star is because apparently I have to put something there."
1.0,"very cheap material, NOT true to size, doesn't look near the picture description."
1.0,Ni siquiera recibí el reloj
1.0,"These things are horrible, they  kept falling apart!"
1.0,"Band is thicker than pictured and much larger around. Also, the flower protrudes quite a bit"
1.0,I didnt feel it fit me right. Idk how to exchage it
1.0,This came and just was way to uncomfortable on my neck there wasn't much dangle after on my neck and im a 4/6 USA size small tops. Kinda cheap looking as well. But would be cute for a costume 1-3 time wear im sure it wont hold up.
1.0,The worst mask ever...It came with some of the stones missing it does not fit properly and the shipper gives you a very hard time with returning it and getting your money back...Do not waste your money on this mask
1.0,"I Was charged duplicate items, and Amazon did NOT with help with getting my money back. Amazon stated that it was my fault, amazing, when I could clearly see  it stated it was technical difficulty on their end. Customer service stated a supervisor will call you back to handle the dispute. No one called back, so I called and he was no more help than the customer services rep. I shop with Amazon quite frequently, but this has just lost a loyal customer."
1.0,fit very poor
1.0,Horrible don't buy
1.0,"It’s huge, deformed, and doesn’t even fit a grown man.  Don’t buy. Should’ve listened to the reviews."
1.0,"Poor quality,  pockets sewn together,  didn't realize that until I dropped my phone ! Will not recommend."
1.0,"Thin fabric.  I did like the colors, but sleeves were too tight.  Didn't fit well at all."
1.0,Nope  couldn’t wear them ... cute for a teenager!!
1.0,These are nothing more than glorified tiny rubber bands. I opened the package up yesterday and was completely disappointed. I think it's one of the worst rip offs I've encountered in a while. These &#34;rings&#34; are cheap and the color isn't even as vibrant as advertised.
1.0,Cheaply made! Don’t waste your money
1.0,"I am normally a size10-12 but ordered these in size XXL because I wanted a very loose, relaxed fit for my sleeping and lounging around the house. The fabric is largely synthetic with minimal stretch. It is smooth but not especially soft. The sleeves are extremely tight as are the leg openings on the shorts. I have found the sizing on a great many garments sold here to run extremely small and have found the sizing charts completely useless. My attempts to adjust by sizing up several sizes have not been helpful since the garment proportions are strange. I have a preteen niece who I plan to pass this on to. I won’t be trying my luck with clothing again."
1.0,Garbage I won better glasses on the boardwalk!
1.0,It seemed it would be more of nude pink but theres nothing subtle about it at all. Very just-had-a-baby pink.
1.0,Terrible construction.
1.0,I wear Reading glasses and these don’t work like reading glasses
1.0,"This is terrible for trying to use on your nails, this is not as advertised. It's too powerful even on the lowest setting, you'll end up filing your skin."
1.0,No era lo que esperaba 😭😭😭
1.0,"Few of the earrings came in flattened out. I was disappointed with the colors not matching the picture. For example, I thought the purple would be more of lilac color, but it was more strong dark purple. The yellow was an ugly orangey yellow, not a bright yellow as pictured. One pair of earrings came with black marks all over the packaging and the earrings came out defective. Overall bad quality even for the money."
1.0,The shirt does not fit true to size. I ordered a 2x and it fits like a large. Not very happy. I usually were a xl but bumped it up a size and the apparently wasn’t enough. I have never worn anything bigger then a 2x. Very unsatisfied customer.
1.0,not a comfortable fit
1.0,"bad materials, color different, it is a piece of junk"
1.0,"These handkerchiefs failed to live up to any expectation I would have of a handkerchief. They are made of the cheapest, thinnest cotton, and are scratchy to the touch. Ouch! And after a while, I started noticing that after a particularly wet use of the handkerchief the dye started to run. Not so it stained my face, thank goodness, but, really,  is this what you want in a handkerchief? Not me."
1.0,This Earring's are so small. Ridiculous. For a little girl. Tiny.
1.0,"Color looks NOTHING like the color in the photo. But worst of all, the size is ridiculous!! You can’t even fit your arm in the opening, the chest area was no where near being able to close a button. I followed instructions and ordered a Large, total waste of money this dress doesn’t fit a child. Funny enough I ordered the EXACT same dress in a different color and the fit was perfect. Go figure..."
1.0,Not true to size they were bigger then what i ordered
1.0,I didn’t  like the material and the spilt was definitely too high for me and too  too small
1.0,"My nose is maybe petit compared to others, although I have never thought so. These nose rings do not pinch enough for proper placement of a septum ring. The metal seems to be good quality which is fine and dandy except that it is hard to adjust for nose size. I literally cannot wear these. Very disappointed as I was super excited to receive my package. :( Would not recommend buying"
1.0,Material very low grade.
1.0,One star for aesthetic. Zero stars for durability. The black coating peeled off the next day. So cheaply painted. Not worthit.
1.0,"I wanted to like it but they chest area was sewn lopsided, so my one boob was going this way and my other boob was going a different way... the lace made the dress look terrible. As well it's really reallllly thin.. so yea don't buy it. You will be disappointed."
1.0,This would have fit great if I was 6'5 125lbs.<br />Also came insanely wrinkled. Weird considering the fabric is made of.
1.0,It was broken and so cheaply made
1.0,"Even though the product is cute, this is the smallest keychain I have ever seen. So little, it looks silly on a keyring and I will not use it. Buyer beware!"
1.0,This looks nothing like the picture. Waste of money.
1.0,Very poor quality. Fell apart in about  months. I would highly suggest you keep looking for a better quality pair of boxer shorts.
1.0,Upon arrival it would not stay closed.  It wasn't worth the drama of returning it so I recycled it instead.  You get what you pay for and I definitely didn't pay much for this thing.
1.0,"Waste of money, do not buy this product. Does not fir Vivofit2."
1.0,I bought a pair of these last year and they fit perfectly. So I bought another pair and the new ones didn’t fit at all. Very tight in the crotch area. Returned them immediately.
1.0,Got three pairs.  All broke on first week of use.  Really bad quality
1.0,"Buenad tardes me gustaria comentarles que me llego el vestido , cuando lo lave siguiendo las instrucciones  de la etiqueta, resulta que al secarse el vestido encogió y nunca pude ponerme lo, me gustaría una solución para este tema , dado que no se se puede utilizar"
1.0,Size is NOT true at all.. runs so small it fits my 10 yr old.would be so cute and would love it it were sized correct.
1.0,"The mask is either too tight or too loose, there is no in between. Not pleased."
1.0,It stretch out within a month
1.0,"The material is so cheap, it ripped the first time I used it. Save your money for something better."
1.0,Don't waste your money. This dress arrived with a large jagged tear and because I didn't find it until just before I sent it to be hemmed I cannot get a refund. LaCera used to be a very good brand but based on this it has descended into garbage.
1.0,Poor fit even though right size. Made cheaply. Very disappointed.
1.0,The dress arrived torn at the waist.  The material isn't very good so just handling the dress to assess the extent of the damage was causing the tear to get bigger and the material to fray.  My daughter was so disappointed that she won't be able to wear her new dress on the 4th of July.  Very carelessly made dress and should have never been sent to a customer in that condition.
1.0,Disappointed was very small stras was soppose to be red came cream
1.0,This was a piece of junk!! The dots were plastic on a flimsy type of material!! Not at all like as advertised! So NO more clothes from here either!!
1.0,Posted as &#34;100% UVA and UVB Protection&#34; -- but the label on the packaging (zoom in) does NOT confirm this.
1.0,"These were flimsy and not adjustable in the back, so they didn't fit."
1.0,They ran small even after I bought a size larger. Not to mention they ripped the second time I put them on. They didn't stay up and were a pain to straighten once they rolled. The design is cute but I wasn't impressed by the cheap material. They did arrive sooner they expected however 2 weeks earlier than over a month of waiting still seemed ridiculous just for these. I wouldn't buy them again nor would I recommend them.
1.0,"Normally a size small, I went one up like recommended. I pulled on the size medium, and had to double-check the product description to make sure it wasn't for kids. Too tiny."
1.0,"These masks are very thin and there is no nose wire, which I believe was advertised. Will keep for emergency use only."
1.0,awful. that’s all i need to say. it wasn’t made well.
1.0,Neck was so loose that I had to return the turtle neck.
1.0,Shotty material for the price. Feels like they’ll fall apart after the first wash
1.0,It’s too tight. I asked my daughter to print a return label because I don’t have a printer. I did not like the way the shirt looked or was made.
1.0,"I totally agree with Chaille Mapes's review. This piece is just huge. It is about 5.5 cm in diameter and about 1 cm width. Also, it is really heavy to be a necklace. It came with a chain and it doesn't seem it can last much. Overall, this is not what I expected."
1.0,"They won't answer me to work on sending the shipping label either. This was sewn poorly, extra fabric, and about 5 sizes too big. I tried to return and they didn't send a label so it'll cost me $45 to ship back."
1.0,Very poor quality<br />Ears are not even glued to the headband.
1.0,This thing was ridiculously small and I even ordered like 3 sizes bigger than what I am just in case an xl fits and Xs!
1.0,Was supposed to glow in the dark and they dont
1.0,"I’ve had these pants for a week. Wore them once, the crotch of them ripped. There was no strenuous activity, I was getting into a car. Horrible product. Will definitely not buy again."
1.0,"If you are looking for quality DO NOT buy. I have attempted to purchase these shoes 3 times in two different colors and each time they were defective. I first ordered these in wine and they were delivered with frayed laces, overall the shoe looked good but I didn't inspect them because I knew I would be sending them back. The second time I ordered I repurchased them in wine and tan. When I received them they were worse quality than the first. Stitching is uneven, the suede is noticeably thin in areas, heel was scratched but worse part of all these shoes feel like you are wearing them on the wrong feet (I checked to make sure I wasn't). The shoe does run a tad bit big. I am always a 8.5 with slightly wide feet and even with thick socks I still had some extra wiggle room."
1.0,Buyer beware!!! My son literally wore them twice and not to anywhere he was running or being a crazy 3yr old and they have fallen apart. The strip where the lights are fell off. I tried to return them but the seller won't take them back due to them not being in the condition they were in when I got them. It's a bunch of crap if you all me!!!
1.0,The customer service is great as they gave me credit for the wrong glasses shipped. The glasses on the other had are awful and the accessories can't manage to save it from a one star rating. The optics on the glasses make everything yellowish and blurry. The micro cloth that comes with it is like rubber and  the case zipper broke after a few times. If you want to buy cheep glasses that cool but don't buy these ones have had better for cheaper.
1.0,Hat was vacuumed packed pump was squashed… didn’t work … both hats!!!
1.0,I am soooo sorry but the sweater is waayyy to small.  This would fit a child.😡
1.0,I really enjoyed this watch for the time I used it.  Unfortunately the battery died after 3 months of use.  It was a great work watch and fit great just wished the battery could give me at least a year or so.
1.0,Very poor quality fabric. It looks cheap and feels strange against my skin. Wish I'd returned it.
1.0,The size and color was great! My daughter is going to love it!
1.0,Just looks like a piece of material hanging off end of sleeve that forgot to be attached.  Not at all what I expected.
1.0,Son para adultos los compre para mis hijos de 4 y 5 años y les quedo enorme
1.0,"The lenses were blurry! I thought it was packaged<br />with film to peel off but nope, they were just blurry. All of them."
1.0,I was using it for casual wear. The material wasn’t what I expected so it didn’t fit.
1.0,"The slighest tug will break the chain/clasp. After a while I gave up and used jewelry wire to hold the bracelet ends together, making it impossible to get off. The braids and string came out of the metal end and was unable to fix it. Ended up throwing it away, definitely would not waste money on it again."
1.0,Sheets stained red first time used!!!!! This was after being washed. Buyer Be Ware!
1.0,One of the bars was stuck and couldn't unscrew from the ball so I sported one angel wing
1.0,Pobre calidad y diseño.
1.0,"These are not comfortable and not true to size at all. I wear a 38 DD in every bra I've ever purchased and they wear great. This is not a 38, these are more 34-36 so you'll want to buy a width larger. Also, one cup wears like maybe a DDD and one a DD so the cups are not built evenly either. Honestly, just go to kohls and but some Hanes bras."
1.0,Cheap and small sizing. Feels like it is worth $5 max.
1.0,"The wet suit material its self is nice however, I my reason for one star is because the zipper is extremely cheap--it broke upon suiting up on my 3rd dive. Could not be repaired, so I had to wear the suit unzipped luckily my tank kept the suit in place during my last three dives of the trip we were on.  The only fix is to replace the zipper or return the suit. Since I sew, I am ordering a better zipper for replacement."
1.0,They might as well made this dress out of paper the material was so thin.
1.0,"Unisex in this case means make a size in the middle of a male and females face size. Too small for myself, too large for my wife."
1.0,"I ordered one pair of slippers. What came in the box were mixed matched styles, which were also two left shoes! How disappointing for the person I gifted them to and embarrassing for me.  I wished I could add my photo here."
1.0,They sent me a different dress. I didnt open it because it was a gift. When my friend opened up her birthday present it literally was tiny and not this dress. I felt like a jerk. And it was past the return date. SMH...my fault and their fault but....ughhh
1.0,They fool you into believing that you were going to get a few of these… Instead you get one .  It has no iridescence and certainly not anything like a rainbow effect .  Completely false advertisement.… Will be returning
1.0,"The watch stopped working not long after buying it, it is not worth the price unless you are not going to use it, and there is no point in getting a watch that is NOT durable."
1.0,"We measured before we ordered this blouse. The size we ordered should have fit based on the company's measurements.  It is way too small, it did not come with a return label and now we need to figure out how to return it."
1.0,Too loose and very thin. Would not recommend.
1.0,Bottoms are same width front and back.
1.0,It was broken when I got it. It took forever to<br />Get to me too.
1.0,Dress was obviously hand made out of flimsy clingy material that barely made it over my head and did not go past my bust.  I was so disappointed it did not look like picture presented it as or fit me when I chose 2x size that it was a waste of everyone's time and looked like someone's first sewing project for school.  Buyer beware!
1.0,Did not even last 3 months os casual use. Terrible quality.
1.0,The clasp broke the first day. Can’t even return cause the charm fell off while hiking. Cheap- don’t buy this!!!!
1.0,Been like the material it was thin and shiny looking
1.0,The twenty 2-3 inch long slashes through the material in each leg make this chilly to wear.  This &#34;distressing&#34; does not appear in the description or the photo as far as I can see.  What is the point of cozy overalls with dozens of holes in them?
1.0,I ordered an XL and was sent an Small. The Sweater was cute but didn’t fit. Disappointed
1.0,"I don't know in what country these would be considered a 10, the are about the size of a 7/8. I wear a 9 and ordered a 10. There is no way I was going to get my toes in these shoes let alone the rest of my fat foot. Don't waste your time or money on these shoes. Sure they looked good but I didn't by them to put on a shelf and look at."
1.0,Not for plus size women sadly<br />Bought these thinking they would fit
1.0,"Look y’all, if you have big yiddies don’t buy this, first off I bought an XL, it’s too small, I read the reviews over and over and I see my big yiddied sister wearing an XXL, so I bought that, IT WAS WORSE THAN THE XL, it’s too tight on my arms, and me being 5’2 it’s way too long, this catfished me for sure"
1.0,Do not purchase if you are over 5’ 6” as they are cropped so short they are almost shorts!
1.0,Daughter tried it on and while the top was not bad it was a little loose and the center was not tacked together so every movement she made it popped open leaving a peep show...now the massive issue the bottomes there is no way someone made the front crotch and thought yes that's great coverage for a child literally it showed 75% of her girlhood like seriously thong for the crotch basically
1.0,The pants came up to my boobs way to high the shirt was perfect as a hole outfit' it was not comfortable to were together  i bought a number of outfits like this one to were around the house and to run<br />around in so i could feel dressed and not look and feel like crap i am also a warehouse worker  at night time so its feels good to put on a  pretty thing when i get home and do my running around
1.0,"The blazer was too small , do not go by size chart label said it was aXXL but really was a small....."
1.0,Teribble quality... nothing close to what seen on picture... material looks cheap... don’t recommend to buy it.
1.0,Super small. More like a half top in a child size.
1.0,I am small chested and the top isn't made to accommodate for that very unflattering at least on me 🙁
1.0,Embroidery is very poor quality. Sloppy and unreadable. Returning for a refund
1.0,Was to blitzzy for my evening wear...
1.0,way too expensive and looks super cheap. Just a piece of paper glued to plastic
1.0,"Do not buy the tanjiro cosplay. When we receive it, we ordered a 2xl and it fit as a medium or a large. The sizing is all wrong and a waste of money"
1.0,Cheap quality and definitely not worth the price!
1.0,Very cute but ran so small I had to return them
1.0,"Ordered silver, got gold. Not happy. Cheap looking."
1.0,It does not fit to standard size.
1.0,Wish I could give 0 stars. Nowhere to put batteries and definitely doesn’t light up.
1.0,Cheaply made. Worn once and the gold finish has already turned. I like the style though.
1.0,Size is deceiving
1.0,Fabric is closer to a plastic bag than actual cotton... or any material for that matter. Do not waste your money!
1.0,"Bigger than shown, to the point of being gaudy. Also feel so cheap and plastic-like. Way overpriced for what you're getting."
1.0,"Lace was torn, the shirt was smaller and than expected. I had to return this."
1.0,"If you are buying this for fashion, make sure you don’t mind the color being more vibrant than what you ordered. If you are buying this to work out? Don’t. The material is not a typical athletic material, doesn’t breathe well, and doesn’t moisture wick. I should have returned it."
1.0,The watch was very good looking and surprisingly for the price that I paid it kept good time. The problem was that if you put it in your pocket normal walking or movement created the stem that sets the time to pop up and move around. So when you took the watch out of your pocket to look it might be 2 hours ahead one hour behind it depends. For the cost of the watch and what I would have to go through to exchange it is not worth it to me. It's a situation where I've decided that something like this should be done at a local store or you can look at it test it and then buy it. The product definitely laxed quality control.
1.0,Gucci ripoff
1.0,I have to return it. It’s too small and when my grandson tried it we found a hole in the front. Very embarrassing.It was a birthday gift
1.0,"Love the design but it doesn’t stay on the ear. It clips on, but doesn’t hold at all. Very dissatisfied."
1.0,The product says it was 3XL and it was size 14- 16 I was very unsatisfied  with this product  and will never buy this item again
1.0,"I was truly disappointed when I opened my package. Just holding it up I knew it wouldn't fit. I wear an xl-2x depending on type of shirt/cut, I ordered a 2x in this product and it's more like a medium, material is cheap, looks nothing at all like the picture provided. Super bummed. Wish I could give it a half star rating, what a waste!!"
1.0,"Just because something is being sold cheap doesn’t mean you should sell something that doesn’t work. Test your products before sending it out. I couldn’t return it because I moved to Costa Rica on the same week, so just took the loss but it’s disappointing.<br />Hope you do better for the next costumer."
1.0,"The image shows the shoes have the blue striped label on the back of the shoe. I received mine today and it is solid pink??? Also, not the quality I expect from Toms."
1.0,This was literally a bed sheet with arm holes. Would make a great costume as a ghost! I returned this sucker
1.0,"The brown ""leather"" on these belts rubs off starting almost from the first wear.  You can get around 30 wears out of it before it needs to be replaced.  Too bad finding a belt this width is next to impossible..."
1.0,"mortal combat was spelled ""motan comgat"""
1.0,"I loved loved this jacket when I got it, it was cute and it didn’t make feel overly hot or cold at all; However I had it for three weeks before it started to fall apart. The first thing that happened was I washed it as per instructions and the “fur” around the hood got all matted like burnt hair.... then a few days later it started to fall apart and open right around the armpit - now is all opened and you can see the insides. So disappointed,  and I can’t even ask for my money back cause I did wear it, and it seemed in good condition when I got it. Purchased Dec 10,2020 - this review is January 19,2021"
1.0,"This looks terrible, not worth a ¢1<br />There is absolutely no way the photo is the actual dress I have. It looks like I have a poorly taken photocopy of the image and they placed it on a satin like sheet and the. Made the dress."
1.0,"The dress is not a woman's size. It is more comparable to a girls size 12 or possibly 14. However, the dress is not appropriate for a child to wear. The fabric of the dress is extremely sheer, and the tunic is also very sheer. If it were worn it would need to be worn over a shirt and leggings."
1.0,Way to small for a 5 year old
1.0,Returned it. It was very thin and not soft. Not what I expected.
1.0,Slightly too small and filter pocket does not fit P2.5 filters correctly. Returned for refund w/o a hassle.
1.0,Definitely not what I expected...very ugly looking and I don't know whose pants pocket is so huge to fit such a wide money clip wallet. I would not even give this away for free and I'm now looking for another wallet with a centre money clip. I should have paid more attention to the picture with the money on the inside as you can see how much bigger the wallet is than the money. Regret I made this purchase in an effort to save on some $$.
1.0,The fabric is so thin you can see everything through it. Might as well be the emperor's new dress! And it ran small
1.0,They came broke and the lenses scratched!
1.0,"These things broke on both sides after two weeks. No screws in them just cheap plastic, and I wasn't even rough on them. Don't buy"
1.0,It is very thin material and it doesn't really compress at all. I got the size as recommended on the sizing chart based on my measurements.  (I actually got 1 size smaller) and it feels like a normal dry fit tank. I like compression shirts to prevent the nipple chafe from running and this did not work my first run in them.
1.0,These are not true to size.  Way too small.  Order at least one additional size up.
1.0,"It looks awful on me. The top is billowy around the chest area and isn't form-fitting. I am a size 16 regularly so I ordered an XXXL according to their size charts. I thought it would fit great because usually swimsuits are a little smaller than normal sizes. Nope! I can wear this suit, but I look like a sack of potatoes. It's just too big. It is not flattering to my body at all. I will be wearing my older suit until I find a better replacement. I will keep the shorts, but the top is not for me. Fabric is like any other bathing suit fabric.<br /><br />I did contact the seller to see if I could exchange it for a smaller size and because I received this one for free, they will not do an exchange because of the cost of shipping. They said to review based on the suit I have. So, I guess nothing ventured, nothing gained. I usually write very good, very detailed reviews. It's their loss."
1.0,Ordered black. The top has a strong blue tint. Sending it back
1.0,"They are lovely, but they hurt my ears real bad.  I could not keep them on for even an hour.  I am not a big person, and dont have big earlobes, but these really hurt to wear.  They do look very nice but what is it worth if you cant wear them?"
1.0,"Received as a gift (after putting on my wish list). These are far shorter than the photos make them appear (yes, my bad for not looking at the size). I’m 5’5” and these barely go from knee to ankle, fully stretched up. They do not hold position for even one hour of actual movement, in fact they fell while just sitting on the couch! I will be returning these. While they are soft, they do not work for me."
1.0,Worthless.  Then post part fell apart before I could even try it on.
1.0,The chain came broke and my broke my daughter heart
1.0,The eyelashes were badly tarnished and black.  The teardrop rhinestone was also loose.  Complete garbage.
1.0,"Washed once, red ran into white stripes. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Enjoy The Styling and appearance, as well as the rear snap to take off the goggles easier. However, after four uses in the pool, the strap snapped as seen in the photo. Based on this poor longevity, cannot advise anyone purchase this."
1.0,ALOT smaller then advertised 16-19 in calf's but good thing is about Amazon I sent them back without any issues
1.0,The pictures of this watch band you can not even see them! All the pictures are just girls butts hanging out of their shorts take a clear picture!
1.0,"This looked nothing like the picture. The seams were different, the fabric looked different. It looked like a cheap knock off of the photo."
1.0,Very cheap quality.  I returned the item because I couldn't give it as a gift.
1.0,"This gets 1 star because it would have been a great purchase, except the extra apostrophe in &#34;cats&#34; makes it look completely stupid. DO NOT BUY THIS GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT PRODUCT OR YOU WILL LOOK STUPID, TOO."
1.0,"no matter what the size chart says, American woman do not really fit the size conversion charts.  Tried many things.  This is the last."
1.0,So big. Terrible sizing.
1.0,"great constructin, but these sandals should be for women with small feet."
1.0,The cord has an adjustable knot slid thing and it came untie the first time I wore it.
1.0,Way to small and short. Asian size for sure. Returned
1.0,The product I received today looks NOTHING like the picture. I am very disappointed that I spent the money I did on this product! ZERO stars for this!!
1.0,Broke within a few weeks
1.0,I had to take a piece from my notebook to fix the strap.
1.0,Came crushed from shipping
1.0,These don't work!  Ontop of fogging up almost instantly (defeating the purpose of the clear shield) the clear plastic collects all the spit and puts it on display for everyone to see.<br />Additionaly the voice is even more muffled and it's harder to breathe in than a regular cloth mask.
1.0,I bought the boots for my son who has worn hen once and they have already cracked.
1.0,"Terrible product, save your money, BOUGHT 2 PAIRS FOR GRANDAUGHTERS FOR CHRISTMAS, ONLY 1 SHOES LIGHTS UP ON 1 OF THE PAIRS, SEND THEM BACK IMMEDIATELY AFTER CONTACTING THEM, THEY TELL ME ITS TOO LATE, LOW QUALITY CHINESE C___!!!!!"
1.0,It’s literally falling apart. I barely wore it outside
1.0,I don't like it. Not good
1.0,Order double no triple your size
1.0,I got Medium size and it was like XS. It was more like teenager size than adults.<br />Had to return it immediately!
1.0,The video shows a front wheel but the pair that was delivered to me had no front wheel
1.0,got silver coating rather than steel/ platinum finish
1.0,These were extremely small can’t even wear them very disappointed order up like two sizes if you’re going to order
1.0,I have wore this ring for 1 week. Settings are already falling  out.
1.0,Es muy pequeño y no es cómodo parecen dos telas unidas pero que no se adaptan
1.0,I was so disappointed in these pants. I was so excited to get them and the material was so cheap and thin i was in shock. These are not even worth 10$.
1.0,Received with a gaint black (oil?) smear across it. Stained.
1.0,Fake. Order this thinking it will look great but got for Xbox. Stickers are not even brand just cheap nock off.
1.0,This was HUGE on me.  If it wasn't such a hassle to return I would have sent it back.
1.0,"Loose and pulling threads, stains and white threads throughout entire sweater. Smaller than average sizing. Trash quality control and for the price you're better off with Hanes or fruit of the loom."
1.0,stickon decal
1.0,Too cheap rubber to tight.
1.0,Looks so fake !!!!!!
1.0,don't waist your money
1.0,"Es de mala calidad, apenas mi hija lo uso se daño, tenía problemas para cargar pasaba haya un día conectado al cargador y no prendía No lo recomiendo"
1.0,The fabric felt like the material Halloween costumes are made of. The fit was stiff and not flattering! It was not flattering or flowing like the photo.
1.0,Logo fell off.
1.0,"Product is very small! I ordered a 3Xl, I usually wear an XL,  and this fit like a medium. Very different from the pictured product."
1.0,Fits small. Cheaply made.
1.0,"the goods not come to this destination<br />  Marian saw yaqueline Soteldo 107790<br />  2217 NW 79th ave<br />  Tecnoship Gruoup Venezuela<br />  Doral, Florida 33122<br />  United States<br />  Phone: +1(305)593-7090"
1.0,"Contrary to claims it does not fit Iwatch.<br /><br />After reading others’ reviews with medical issues about how they bought this for their Apple Watch (just in case), I did the same. Waste. Doesn’t fit. Therefore I have no use for this."
1.0,"&#34;Stones&#34; almost don't exist. I had to take it to a jewelry shop for them to confirm there was stones at all, and they did, but they are as a tinny as a sand grain, and they don't shine neither. Lost money"
1.0,"this product cost a lot of money- comparable to a David Yurman bracelet. Yet, it arrived in a plastic bag and was much cheaper than it looks on the picture. It was meant to be a birthday gift and certainly did not fit the bill for the price."
1.0,Definitivamente no m gustan yo no las usare
1.0,Missing straps
1.0,"The product seems like great quality. From a military point of view it seems durable enough to withstand the hardship I am going to put it through. However, when irecieved my two key chains, one of them was missing one of the rings. Accuracy it’s very important to me. My items were not delivered complete that is why it’s a one star for me. Disappointed."
1.0,Magnet doesn’t stay
1.0,"Terrible fit. Runs small. Super tight top, bottom poofs out too big. The material is made of non stretchy flannel material."
1.0,"I ordered a 3x based on the size chart. I’m 5’9 200 lbs and the dress was way too big and barely came to my ankles. The striped pattern was off in sections. I tried it with a belt; not bad but still too big and unflattering. I  suggest getting a size smaller but if you’re tall and want this to touch the ground, don’t bother."
1.0,"Not true to size, not flowy like described, and cheap see through material. Very disappointed."
1.0,Not true to size! This is a true fat wrapper!
1.0,This is far too big for any 7-10 year old.  The watch face is too large.  The wrist strap is too long.  The description should be changed to adult.  Will be returning.  Included photo of this watch with the other kid size watch that I ordered at the same time. The other watch is the perfect size for a 10 year old.
1.0,Fit is small. Shirt is shorter than expected.
1.0,Didn’t like the material at all it looks cheap
1.0,"These look really unnatural! i would never wear them out. They are very lightweight so they don't even hang downwards all the time, and if they move, the whole hoop moves along with your earlobe, instead of pierced earrings that kind of roll side to side when you move, if that makes sense. At least having tried these, I know that I'll never be able to wear hoops unless I get my ears pierced, or the hoop is hanging from a little chain or something.  The goldtone also looks cheap, though I expected that, of course."
1.0,"I needed a green shade, but this is very heavy, and the glass makes it darker. I am not sure about Polarization and UV filters. It's rugged but makes vision a problem."
1.0,Unfortunately the rose fell off after only a handful of wearings.
1.0,"Was not easy to put on, and it did not charge while in the case."
1.0,Box came empty
1.0,Very very cheap.  Light weight.  Charms we're put on backwards.  Avoid. Do not recommend.  Junk.
1.0,"This is about two sizes smaller than what I ordered, fit wise"
1.0,"If I can give -10, I will do it. It badly bleached."
1.0,"Too big, and you have to pay for return shipping."
1.0,Cheap and flimsy...not heavy cut material.
1.0,It pinched my ears and broke after 3 days
1.0,"I had high hopes for this dress, but when it arrived I was super disappointed. It's made out of this heavy, stretchy, cheap material, not light and flowy at all. The colors and pattern are not the same as the photo (much brighter material and more yellow color than anything). And the overall dress is not the same as the photo. It is a cheap and not well made knock off."
1.0,"These are decent gloves, misleading advertising! No way  1 pair of these gloves is worth $24.99 I have purchased these gloves before same price and they always come in a 3 pack. Now i have to waste time i don't have return them, so now along with being ripped off i have no gloves for work."
1.0,It was a waste of money.
1.0,"Really nice style on, but they have absolutely no UV protection.  All of my sunglasses with UV protection make my phone screen and computer screens change colors and these are the ONLY sunglasses I have that do not to that. I learned a lesson....stop buying cheap stuff. Will most likely return as these will be on no use this summer on my trips if they aren't protecting my eyes."
1.0,cheap hat. No shape.
1.0,Absolutely infuriating. Haven't even worn it. It came completely disassembled and is impossible to put together.
1.0,"They lasted for 1 day at the Wisconsin Dells before they fell apart. The insoles came out and they are sticky like glue, and there are holes through out the fabric."
1.0,"Very thin material, scratchy like cardboard. Terrible quality"
1.0,No me agrado por que la bota que me mandaron es de material sintético
1.0,Waaaaaaaaay too big
1.0,"So i had to return mine because it did not look at all like in the picture. Even the material, design, or the look of the dress was completely different then any of the pictures or styles that they have to chose from. Very disappointing, because the picture looks cute"
1.0,"Bag it self is really cute, but it was sent to me without its strap."
1.0,It looks so good at first . After few days  it turned black  and I got allergic  reaction to the metal. It's not  silver as mentioned.
1.0,The hooks that go into your ear are facing the wrong direction.
1.0,"Bent real bad within the fist week, so sad because they are so cute."
1.0,The Asians need to specify their clothes run at least two sizes smaller...also Amazon needs to do a better job of letting the customer know the product is coming from another country.
1.0,Would not purchase again. Very long and push outside of the nose so it looks all jacked up and goofy. U get what you pay for.
1.0,It was very uncomfortable
1.0,"Looks cool beyond belief, I only wore it for a few days before the adhesive started coming out the sides in little black sticky rolls, and then the rubber started gapping from the inset center square.  The white rubber strap started to discolor (I wasn't wearing anything with cheap dyes), and it just ended up looking cheap and ugly.<br /><br />I was so bummed, it had been such a cool watch."
1.0,"ripped on side<br />cheap materials,  do not waste your money."
1.0,If only u could give it 0 stars they are HUGE way way way to big! They gave me a rash but you get what you pay for I guess
1.0,It didn't fit my watch
1.0,"Size is 2 sizes smaller. Than what is losted for recomended size. No stretch and tight in the mid section area. Could see lits of sweating in this material. Sent it back paid more than it cost, then no refund and eventually it was sent back. Out a lot of money on this one. Still in the same package it left in with a hundred other stamps from China or who knows where. Super upset I did not get reimbursed anything and out 50 plus dollars in shipping back fees. So they got shipping twice 🤔"
1.0,I followed the product directions carefully and performed multiple applications. Unfortunately the brim of my hat stiffened minimally and the spray left a gray residue all over. I would not recommend the product.
1.0,Cheap material that feels horrible and seems like it could rip by being pulled on. Also extremely see through.
1.0,Took the first one off of the packaging and it broke.
1.0,Besides the fact that it took forever to be delivered it looks & feels extremely cheap!  : (
1.0,Tiny. Not as expected.
1.0,"First of all this hat looks exactly as shown. However it says one size fits all, which is not the case. It has an adjustable strap that may work for some but not all. But it does look and feel good.<br />My head is 7 3/4's....this product will not adjust to a size that large."
1.0,"Just got this and ready to return. This is really poor quality and doesn't look the same as the picture. No flair and pattern doesn't match up. The fabric is gross it's the kind that back in the 50s, 60s they made mens pants out of it. My granny wore dresses from it. This fabric snags and runs really easy."
1.0,Looked pretty when I received but could definitely tell it was cheaply made. After 1 month it broke and the colors faded quickly. Also the metal would cut me whenever it pressed up against me.
1.0,Don’t recommend. I wore them twice as back up sunglasses and stored in my vehicle. They failed internally and can now not see out of them. Just storing these over time ruins them total garbage.
1.0,"FALSE ADVERTISING ALERT! I thought these masks were sharp looking online, so I ordered 3 different styles.  It says rhinestones,  but ummmm?! THERE ARE NO RHINESTONES ON THESE! I'm extremely disappointed 😞"
1.0,"Item I received does not even remotely ressemble item pictured. False advertising. Item is on a cheap chain, NOT a Snake Chain. Complete rip off."
1.0,"Gross gross gross. You get what you pay for, so I was not expecting much.  This is worse, worth maybe $4 at retail."
1.0,the quality and fit was very bad
1.0,I only wore this for a few weeks before one end stripped out and it wouldn’t stay together anymore. Very disappointed.
1.0,"The material is good but the outfit is far too small. I got the largest size, which is what I normally wear, and it still didn’t fit me. The shirt did for the most part, though it was a little short, but the pants are very small and incredibly short. The crotch-to-waist section of the pants is too short to even cover my rear end, and it’s so short that it digs uncomfortably into my crotch and the old family jewels. Not comfortable, to say the least. I sent these back."
1.0,The colors faded Into each other the first time I washed it!
1.0,"Didn't buy it for myself.<br />But I did see it.<br />And what I thought to be a loose cotton shorts, turned out to be a stiff, shiny cloth material.<br />Also seemed small.<br /><br />Has pockets though."
1.0,I ordered my normal size and could not get them up past my knees.
1.0,It sucked it broke in half when I put it on my face
1.0,Ordered four sets 3 were medium...all varied in size! Very disappointed!<br />Never again.
1.0,"These are fairly thin masks, run on the small side, they also state that they have a wire nose piece and they don't."
1.0,"The pattern is the same but not loose at all, short and uncomfortable, itchy, even the sleeves are a bit short!! The return process is a pain so I’ll just keep it I guess"
1.0,"Do not waste your time or money!! Cheaply made, see through, if you decide to try them out make sure you size up at least one size. I returned my order."
1.0,Material is very flimsy. Larger than expected.
1.0,"Terrible print. Love the flowers but the print on the fabric was awful. Went to send it back but we lost it in our move! It'll show up and I'll pop it in the garbage when it does!! Yet, the other prints of the same top are really nice. Go figure!"
1.0,"I did not like this product at all, was very disappointed with it, and I returned it back to the company.<br /><br />I will just have to keep looking for something better that is not expensive for this winter season for my boots.<br /><br />I don't have much of a recommendation for anyone else to try it."
1.0,The material is cheap and not stretchy
1.0,Nice product but way to small
1.0,"Big design flaw.  I've been using it less than a week and twice the keychain has opened unexpectedly, sending my housekey flying.  Once I was in the parking lot of the grocery and it's a wonder I found it.  Do not recommend!"
1.0,Cute but they are plastic. When you bend and open them they are super fragile and will flake and break just like children's costume jewelry.<br /><br />Update: Changing to one star due to the fact that these turn my nose green. Aka fake asf....
1.0,Cheap earrings.  Price too high.  Haven't worn any of them.  Wish I had my money back.
1.0,Meh!  Looks and feels cheap.  Going back.
1.0,Hated these. They fit oddly and we're broken in arrival.
1.0,"Was really disapointed in this,  looks very bad in person - like a halloween costume. I'm all for a bargain and wasn't expecting Chanel but this was baaad."
1.0,"The purse is large and I like it. On the downside,  it smells like something died in it. I had to put it outside and spray it with febreeze. So far after 3 days outside, it is getting less stinky.  Perhaps something went wrong in tanning the leather. The price is right, if I can ever get the stink out of it."
1.0,It was too small the speakers couldn’t reach my ears
1.0,The short was way too smal! It was an extra large the one i ordered but it looked like a small one and my niece who is tiny is wesring it! 😡
1.0,"Felt like i was walking on plaster board<br />No cushion, horribly made<br />Killed my feet, pinky toe on both feet felt swollen and blistered"
1.0,does not run true to stated size
1.0,I gave this as a gift without realizing that it was put together inside out.  The tags are sewn on the “right” side of the sweater.  Overall a cheap looking product.  Not a fan.
1.0,"Ordered the black ones. The black dye from the gloves ended up all over my face, hands, and clothes. Such a mess."
1.0,Didnt check them and remained in bag.. just tried and so tight in chest.. should have checked and gotten a size up
1.0,"I got them for my daughter's upcoming nutcracker show, thinking it would look nicer than her usual Bloch ones. Nope!! the canvas was thinner and low-quality fabric and worst of all, the size is way too small. She has 1.5 x-narrow from Bloch and it fits well. Capezio 1.5 was way smaller than her Bloch 1. Now I am returning them with a $1.5 restocking fee in addition to the shipping cost.  Going back to Bloch."
1.0,"Very unflattering, material was kind of creepy, like walking around in a tent"
1.0,"These are super cute! Too bad they are like clomping about in clown shoes.  They have no bend at all! They kind of just stay rigid. I thought they would be comfy since they are Nike, they are not.  The toe area is very narrow as well."
1.0,Poor quality.  Looks used.  Zipper is faulty
1.0,not as pictured..
1.0,It was way too expensive for what was actually sent. It’s more so fit for a child. I should have sent it back.
1.0,Horrible quality. Very disappointed. It broke the 1st wear!! Do not purchase!
1.0,Bought for my sister sizing is very off
1.0,No place for breast. Fabric is lower quality.
1.0,The wings are very small!! The wings do have REAL feathers on them (believe turkey feathers)!! The feathers on the bottom of my wings pretty much all broke off!! The bottom feathers are very dry and brittle!! The smallest bump on those bottom feathers and the broke!!!<br />NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!
1.0,"poor quality, do not buy."
1.0,"Very bad quality. I knew it was a cheap costume, but the Fringe was literally falling off as I took the dress out of the packaging. Do not recommend. Definitely sending back!"
1.0,Nothing worthy of spending more for these. Don't exceed result you get for cheap off the rack versions.  Hard to clip on without get your glasses dirty. Overall Highly Over rated. Gonna give them one more try and decide whether I will return
1.0,This is the second time I attempted to receive women's socks and I received MENS!  I give up!  I'll order elsewhere.
1.0,"I’m not sure what’s going on. I ordered the cute German Shepherd mask on Aug. 24. I got a message on Sept. 13 telling me my order was cancelled. I checked my mail, and I found a delivery from Amazon, but it was the wrong mask. What I received was the photo - a rectangle with corgis and flowers, and no pocket for a filter. It would not cover both my mouth and nose, nor fit the advertised filters. I have no idea what scam they are pulling, but don’t fall for it. I waited 17 days for a product I didn’t order and conflicting information. I would give zero stars if possible."
1.0,"I bought a medium.  thought I was going to die by suffocation while trying this dress on.  It was very tight, no flex in the material.  I had a panick attack trying to take it off.  It is not made for a woman with a bosom at all.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!"
1.0,Not dark grey. Too thin
1.0,Very weak. Didn’t even last a few days and scissors fell off. What a complete let down. And this was a birthday present. DO NOT BUY.!!!
1.0,"Beautiful dress, but zipper broke as soon as I put it on my daughter."
1.0,"While these socks are amazing, I was disappointed to see one of the socks come unraveled at the bottom after only wearing once.  My expectation would be that at this price point, they would hold up better."
1.0,Ordered size 7 got a 9
1.0,"After about 1 use, these wings started to fall apart. This makes me so sad. The feather are glued onto a very thin piece of cardboard"
1.0,Fell apart after only about a month of use!!
1.0,"I have purchased this bag TWICE expecting to receive what I see in the picture, and what they send me is completely different.<br />The quality is good, specially for the price but not to receive what you are expecting is very disappointing. Specially if it happens twice."
1.0,They are nice but the size runs small.
1.0,Did not wash well
1.0,Total piece of junk- something you could find at the dollar store.
1.0,Too big by approx. 2 sizes.
1.0,Very tiny and not as pink in the photo.
1.0,These are awful. I'm not returning them because I already used them but they're not good to keep on your nose because they're either too tight or too loose. These are not something I would ever buy again.
1.0,The camel toe is strong in these shorts. Don't buy loolol
1.0,Worn for a couple of hours and started unraveling on side of shirt.
1.0,"There’s random white stitching that appears stretched in random spots on these black masks. Then the circle on one is completely discolored, you can’t see how bad in pics, the light part is very light like white w/a slight tint of orange. The mask with the face was half black. My boys were excited to get these masks and were so disappointed seeing them, as was I. Now I have to go out of my way to return them because they weren’t inspected as they should have been before packing."
1.0,"IF you absolutely positively need a sock guaranteed to slip down and end up in a wad around your toes these are for you! These would make a great gift for someone you really don't like, to give them a plain message what you think about them. They do fit nicely into the garbage receptacle, after you wear them once or twice. I doubt you can put up with wearing them more than that."
1.0,It doesn't look the dress online I will send it back
1.0,I just &#34;received&#34; this in the mail and the package was empty. I will have to reorder since I'm sure no one is as fault.
1.0,"Pretty crappy, very small."
1.0,This vest doesn't heat up properly. It is a waste of money. Don't even bother
1.0,"It doesn't look anything like the picture. I ordered the pink one and got a red rag with a large red sash across the bottom. Tacky and made poorly. Not worth it, even as an add on."
1.0,"The feel of the material was cheap satiny, not at all the soft legging material that was described"
1.0,"I really liked the thickness of the memory foam sole, however the part that goes between the toes detached from the sole within 2 days of wearing! I have no idea why they wouldn't attach this in a different manner bc it would be an excellent house shoe if they did. Very disappointed."
1.0,More than pijamas !
1.0,THIS SHOE IS CHEAP MADE AND FITS IN CHINESE SIZE ONLY!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!
1.0,I gave this to my 5 year-old niece since it took over a month to receive and looks extremely cheap. THIS IS A REAL REVIEW!!! I am not a robot or hired by the company to make ratings go up.
1.0,"I thought I was getting a mask that looked liked the picture.  Instead, the skyline is a big blue smeared edge.  The stars look like firecracker, misshaped stars.  I wish I did not buy this mask."
1.0,These run at least one full cup size and chest size small.  Lace covering is cheap.  Make is cheap.  Don't bother.
1.0,"The picture is very misleading. This shirt is very chinsy and the stitching was practically falling out when I received it. I didn’t even bother trying it on, I just sent it back."
1.0,Product was broken when I received it
1.0,"This won't cut the glare of the sun like they advertise,they suck!"
1.0,I wear medical support hose for my varicose veins but thought I would give these a try.  At first they felt great and my legs felt great but by the end of the day the veins were quite aggravated.  Stick with the medical hose!
1.0,I still want it don't know y it canceled
1.0,This hoodie is made TOO small according to the sellers listed size chart.  You need to buy at least 2-3 sizes above your normal size!!
1.0,I paid what its worth
1.0,"Not functional, I have a hard time getting what I need out of the purse.  The leather texture get caught on everything.  It’s literally 2 purses sewn together."
1.0,"They look great, but lasted less than a month. The frames split above the right lens. Ugh. Guess I got what I paid for."
1.0,Don’t Easter your time or money feels like plastic
1.0,The necklace was broke when I opened the package.
1.0,The actual lotus piece has a smooth sheen on one side and a ribbed texture on the other. To wear them properly you’d have one side smooth and one side ribbed. They made them the same instead of mirrored. I just wear the bars.
1.0,Size was not as ordered
1.0,Super cheap material.... I would not recommend this item.
1.0,"These earrings had ""bubbles"" in the shiny gold finish, and in addition one spot on one earring (upper disk) had a dullness where the finish was not shiny--it looks like it might just be a smear, but it's not, the finish is flawed.  It's a shame, they would be so pretty otherwise. Returning"
1.0,"Don't buy this, they turned my nose green."
1.0,I Don't even want to give it one star! Product was not a swim suit! It wasn't even black dont waste your time! This is a total scam!
1.0,"This is definitely not a cotton blend. It's made out of a sort of swimsuit or leggings material which drapes poorly. Looks like I'm wearing a red trash bag. Would have been actually cute if the material was what they wrote it was, but it's a blatant misrepresentation to get more purchases. That stuff may fly on eBay or aliexpress, but Amazon should crack down on stuff like this."
1.0,One star only because the material is awful feels like paper. The style of this top is super cute wish they would have made out of something else besides this awful material.
1.0,"The gloves are attractive, but the fingers and thumbs are much too long.  I have short fingers so I expect the glove fingers to be on the long side. However, the glove thumbs were so long that they flopped down.  I have never had a pair of gloves sized like this.  FYI.. I have had many Isotoner gloves over the years and have never had a problem with the overall fit.<br /><br />I was disappointed that I had to pay for return shipping, which ended up being almost half of the original cost of the gloves.  I feel that I shouldn't have had to pay when the gloves were shaped so oddly in the thumb area."
1.0,"I ordered this dress to wear to a dance next month. Being 8 months pregnant I thought it would flatter being that it flows nicely in the pics and reviews. ABSOLUTLEY DID NOT RECEIVE THE RIGHT STYLE. This dress I got is hideous and looks awful on me, especially in the belly area. I hope I can find something in time."
1.0,"These plugs irritated my lobes so bad that they were sore for days! They claim to be surgical steel, but I doubt it. I had such a bad reaction to them, even tried wearing them a second time and they did it again."
1.0,"Stitching around the sleeves was horrible.  Stitched so poorly, it looked almost ruffled.  It looked like the sleeves had been cut off and sewn by someone who didn't know what they were doing."
1.0,Thought I ordered the dog pattern but received cats!
1.0,Product that came was not the same as the pictured item
1.0,Was disappointed with this ring it didn't look as elaborate as the picture was much smaller than I thought too also looked like the gold was already starting to turn so I sent it back
1.0,Too short and thin
1.0,"Fabric is strange, really heavy and slick sort of. They hit below the knee at first then shrank after the first wash and are unwearable as the length is above the knee now."
1.0,"Yikes. Looks nothing like the picture - style and color are off. There are no tags of any kind, as if someone knitted this on their couch, and it has a weird chemical smell. Looks like it’ll unravel quickly. Fits super small. Very disappointed."
1.0,Way to small for the money pendant and chain
1.0,"Pretty cheap, not upset because ot wasnt expensive"
1.0,"For reference I'm 5'5&#34; 170 lbs.They have to stretch so much for larger sizes and get so thin that they are only good as tights, unless you wear them with a really long baggy sweater and tall boots. ...MAYBE then they'd be ok. Also the &#34;whisker&#34; effect on the front was a bit fuzzy and not clearly printed. As usual in Amazon roulette, when shopping for clothes and can't physically inspect an item, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."
1.0,"Purse looked pretty cheap, and straps broke within a few weeks. Waste of money."
1.0,Run xtra small this the only thing so far hasnt fit the way I would like
1.0,That is realy cruel doing that to seahorses.
1.0,"too yellow and cheap material, fell apart immediately."
1.0,The color is way off. Its a very dark brown navy. Feels like its cheap materials and the crasp area where it connects to the watch is also very low grade metal. Overall it doesnt feel like its anywhere close to garmin quality. Even for a off brand.
1.0,"Pictured buttons were black but the actual buttons were a lighter color. 2xl but it fit like an XL... Didn't wanna fight about refund, so I just gave it to my nephews"
1.0,"For starters, this shirt is not a regular tshirt material.. it is a weird stretchy material. The shirt is midsized, the 2XL fit more like a L. It’s also super short. To top it all off.. there was literally strings of stitching coming from everywhere! Don’t buy this, it’s a piece of crap."
1.0,It isn't what it is described as it also Runs EXTREMELY SMALL a large is a small it dont even look like the shape of it in the picture
1.0,There were many spots where the fabric was fraying. This style did not work with my body frame. It was lightweight material and cute
1.0,"Based on on other reviews I must have received cheap substitutes - the socks I received did fit well, but are very thin (top & bottom).  I won’t this brand again."
1.0,"Straight size MEDIUM here, with narrow shoulders, and this is far too tight on me. I have a standard sized head, wearing standard hats, and the neck opening felt uncomfortable to pull on over my head. I wouldn't want to put this one after putting on my serums and all that, nor would I want to put this on after brushing my hair. Of course, I had to take off my glasses, which was irritating, and once this was on, after I situated it properly, the shoulder shaping was revealed as sized for a small teenager. The shoulder width on the one I received is thirteen inches. It has no buttons or snaps to open and close without pulling on over your head, but the neck is teeny tiny, and the shoulders are bizarrely tight. This is a hard pass, unless you want it to deconstruct it and make something else out of it. Also, I am sorry to report it reeked of mildew. Good luck in your search."
1.0,Not for me. Very flimsy
1.0,"This states it is a full finger enclosed glove, it is false! It was missing the thumb and 2 fingers! Poor customer service. It was bought before my daughters birthday and I wrapped it, never knowing it was missing protection! Too late for returning & no exchanges. Do not buy!"
1.0,"This really made me mad, it would not even fit a 10 yr olds wrist let alone an adult.  It was just a wee too big for a 8 month baby. Sell it in the children's section.<br />Wasted money on this"
1.0,Way too thick to even use. Worried I would break a string
1.0,"Nothing about these pieces of scrap metal met my expectations, they are the biggest waste of time and money I've ever seen, 14k gold plated? Lol that's a joke, I never write reviews but  I just want nobody else in the history of the world to ever buy these pieces of trash! I feel like they  have came with a bottle of lube that's how hard I got f...ed!  Picture is after one day of having them keep that in mind.  If they make me choose a star I Obviously it's going to be one but that equals a -500. I just can't believe that the product is terrible Is even offered!"
1.0,Necklace broke after only a couple uses
1.0,The zipper very poor quality
1.0,"I've never written a review on Amazon before, but I had to with these boots, they suck, don't buy them, they fit and appear to be okay quality which is the only good things I can say, after wearing them for only 20 minutes my feet have never hurt more, the bottom of the boots have no cushion or curvature, I might as well tape steel sheets to my feet, on top of that the edges around the top dog into your ankles, after only wearing these shoes for five days, I have blisters on the bottom of my feet and worn skin on my ankles, boots are supposed to protect feet not torture them."
1.0,Neither cradle would snap on the back of my watch. I had to use a rubber band to keep it connected to my watch.<br />Their not worth the money. I would not recommend getting these chargers.
1.0,"I've bought this for my mom's bracelet TWICE!!! Both times the little girl fell off after about two months. My mom said she looked down and all that she saw was a ""blob of glue"" It is very cute, but won't last.  Look for something else.  By the way, same thing for the boy charm"
1.0,"Breast Cancer Awareness fundraising, color bleeds onto whatever it touches"
1.0,"Bracelet is tiny, could only fit an infant! Don NOT waste your money!"
1.0,Was not pleased with the material. Feels rough to the touch and the front is too large.
1.0,I was disappointed. It did not look like the picture. It also looked used even though it was advertised as being new.
1.0,They were small and cheap! The delivery option had me running all around looking for it instead of just leaving it at my door.
1.0,Do not waste your money on these. It is all hype. My ass was flatter in these than in person.
1.0,"This dress was wildly teeny tiny! I am a 34B/36A and the XL was not even close to closing over my chest! I measured it would need about 3"" more to even touch , then maybe 2"" more for a comfy fit. I normally can do a medium/large in most American sizes in a dress like this, but these are designed by/for itty bitty framed Chinese women.  Also, it looks like each print of this dress runs wildly different then the others. I ordered the green with the cute floral print. 100% sending it back. Also, it was obvious someone else returned this dress before it got to me, it was wadded up and an unbuttoned mess. It's hit or miss with these very inexpensive Amazon made in China dresses... this one is an absolute miss. :("
1.0,"I did not open this package until yesterday for my grandson’s birthday. Unfortunately the zipper keeps getting stacked and won’t zip up. He now can not even use it for the cold weather we have. I am sending it back for a replacement but if the same problem presents again,I would like to ask for a full refund, thank you."
1.0,Sexy outfit. Top is for a toddler. Returned item. Was very disappointed
1.0,The chain broke in 2 day’s I didn’t even wear it to sleep or the shower :(
1.0,"very disappointing, received a used dress with stain and body odor!"
1.0,It wasn't elastic waistband. And the fabric of the shorts was very cheap. Felt like polyester dish towel that you get at the dollar tree. Threw it in the trash and learned a lesson.
1.0,My daughter tried the mask on and the nose broke off. I have had to superglue it back on. I could have made it for less money and it would look better
1.0,They didn't even come up to my knee 😭 o have pretty thin legs and they were super tight. waste of money.
1.0,"Not sure if I received a defective watch but the watch clasp didn’t open and the links were extremely tedious to move and some were not eligible to remove, can be a faulty product one time which I won’t bash the producer as a whole but the product that I got was not manageable at all"
1.0,I love how soft these sock feel but they are just too tight around my ankles.
1.0,changing my rating to a zero..the product didn't last a year and Watch Colony did<br />not stand by their product..it's worthless...do not buy it ..
1.0,lenses fell out first time i wore them ...
1.0,This broke within 3 days of use. A small piece of metal holding the clips gave out and cannot be fixed. I do not carry a heavy purse either. Not sure what the issue was but definitely not sturdy or recommended.
1.0,Very disappointed in this bag.  It didn't look like the picture at all. Very cheaply made and looked like it would be for a child.  I guess you get what you pay for but Amazon made it easy to return.  Thanks Amazon!
1.0,Came  broken and bent
1.0,"I am a 22/24 and the 5xl is what I ordered. This swimwear is beautiful....rich in color!! The bottoms are fantastic but the top is horrible and I hate that I have to return it. The top has underwire but honestly, it's not good for a heavy top person like myself....and the straps should be top of the swim suit as well as on the side for extra security.....wish I could figure out how to make this work but i'm returning it!!!"
1.0,I attached this to my shoulder bag for easy access to my keys and I have no idea how or when and where it fell off and I lost my keys!!! I was so upset. I would not recommend this to anybody.
1.0,The chain broke on this just a few days into wearing it.
1.0,if you are a sex worker do not use...lol seriously the band on the inside of the dress you cant walk in it or even spread your legs
1.0,"Doesn't fit like the picture shows,  way to big and heavy"
1.0,Ordered a 3XL and I cant even get it over my head.
1.0,"Had an allergic reaction - obviously not hypoallergenic metal. If you have sensitive skin, this product may not be right for you. I’ve never had a reaction to the authentic Apple band."
1.0,Cheaply made. The metal design was sticking out half way. Would not recommend.
1.0,too small and horrible fabric
1.0,I like the stone personally but it broke off the necklace right away
1.0,Looks really cheap and very light. I had to ship it back right away for the refund.
1.0,To small for your wrist
1.0,"I received this item today. Very cheaply made but worse the fit is ridiculous. The size chart is WAY off.I ordered a medium sizing up slightly.  I am 5'1, 125 lbs, wear a size 2/3 jeans and 34 B bra and this was so tight on my crotch I couldn't get it up! The length from shoulder to crotch was unbelievably short. Terrible sizing. I don't even know if a Large would fit."
1.0,"First pair I received were both right ear (the snakes face outward from the face, so that didn’t work). I exchanged them. Second pair, the back broke off as soon as I put it in my ear. These are so cheaply made."
1.0,cuts off circulation
1.0,"I returned all 3 jackets (one cranes in flight on blue background, one with a large dragon on the back panel, one botanical print) WITH A LETTER explaining that I wanted the jackets as described, made of a COTTON - LINEN BLEND fabric.<br /><br />In fact, these 3 patterns are all made of cheap 100% polyester, a fiber that pills badly, generates static, holds perspiration odor forever, & doesn't breathe in hot weather.<br />I asked Prijouhe to *correct* the item details, & accurately state that the fabric is polyester - not a blend, & definitely not ""cotton - linen"".<br />We'll see how many months that takes - or possibly they will leave the wrong information posted permanently.<br /> - terry"
1.0,Not a cute fit at all.
1.0,Not happy!!! My order came with broken pieces.
1.0,I am beyond upset with the quality of these pants. I wore them for two hours today For a special occasion only to find out that they were ripping at the seems. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. Do not buy these pants unless you don’t mind your underwear showing through halfway through your day
1.0,"Way to small and I'm not a big girl, gave it to my daughter"
1.0,"So I got this dress and I ordered a size up like suggested.... first the material is disgusting. And there’s a definite sheen to it second the neckline is so high almost to my collarbone, third you can see right through the dress. It is very misleading and does not look like the picture at all! Very disappointed"
1.0,hard to program does not really work
1.0,"Do not buy these. They are not polarized, just very dark sunglasses. I did not realize this until it was too late to return them. It is a lie they are polarized and they should be removed as an option. Very, very displeased."
1.0,"I've ordered many items from Qiyun, and usually I love their items.  The stones were different colors,  I threw it in the trash."
1.0,I really like the length of the socks. I don’t like the fact that the material was much thinner than I expected and the heel practically disintegrated from the get go. Also the top lost its elasticity after one wash. Now the socks are quitters! Which means they just fall down and bunch up. Nobody likes quitters!!
1.0,"It's a really good idea though, hat with attached beathable mask together. But the fabric is so thin, like a windbreaker. And little small for adults. Not gonna keep it."
1.0,"I just passed my 30 day return limit, and the teeth on the zipper are falling off, not impressed. I cannot use the wallet."
1.0,Received an empty bag
1.0,after two washes it is full of white marks
1.0,Within wearing for a few hours one of the seems ripped. Luckily I was just hanging out at home all day and not at work.
1.0,"Oficial ktm are the worst, the shirts and fleccee are bad quality and the sizes are smallers than the description."
1.0,The photo of the sweater on the model that the seller uses misrepresents the actual sweater. It is too short. It should come below your hips for a more pleasing look. The fabric and colors on model are completely different. Returned for refund. So sad😕
1.0,Quality of stitching is so sloppy that the front looks like the back and it just looks cheap.
1.0,"Overall, I liked it but the size was too small for medium. I don’t know if it was mis sized or they really make their clothes run too small. I’m regularly small size but I ordered medium because I like a little loose too but this one won’t even reach the buttons. It’s really too small."
1.0,I was very excited when it first arrived. It fitted nicely. It's a little small however I'm a muscular guy so most shirts fit tight. The reason for my 1 star is what happened after I washed it. The shirt comes very ridged so I washed it as I do with any new shirt and the color bled. The white parts are now light blue. Very upset.
1.0,Items do not match description. Masked received was felt. Description said mask was 100% latex rubber! Very disappointed!
1.0,The fits very comfortable but it fits very loose around the ears and the blows right through it. Not good for cold windy weather.
1.0,"Found these a little tight for a 4X<br />But most concerning no room for my junk<br />As it were, like no room !!"
1.0,Not flattering and very cheap material.
1.0,Way tooo big
1.0,"Thin, very cheap looking"
1.0,I would like a more durable product - 1 I could wear all day every day for at least a year.
1.0,Not well made and do not look like the photos
1.0,Tried numerous times did not work.
1.0,"This product runs small and is VERY thin, almost see through. I bought it for my 14 year old and I'm less then impressed. It's definitely NOT a sweatshirt. It doesn't look like the image or fit the description."
1.0,Looked like a moo moo that needed ironing.
1.0,"Do not waste your time nor money.  They are very, very small they will not fasten, poorly made."
1.0,"Dress was supposed to come in with sequence dress under coming in fully velvet. The fabric was very, very loose and unflattering. It is not something that I will be purchasing again"
1.0,"There is padding in the top but the deep v would require a special bra or going without. Zipper in the back. The slit in the pic looks cut but as I saw with some of the personal pics, once you get it on, it really would have been a better design with no slit at all as depending on your frame you might not be able to stand let alone sit without flashing the world.  I'm 175 and a 36c and I ordered a LG that fit just fine. However, if they closed the slit and removed the pads I probably wouldn't have sent it back."
1.0,This was cheap quality. It was completely see through
1.0,"The watch worked for a day or two. I spent ten dollars to have the band sized.  It no longer keeps time at all!  I have set the time three times and it does not move.  I will return the watch and would very much like to be reimbursed the ten dollars.<br />IT SHOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE RATING FOR THE $10 SPENT AND THE TIME ORDEING, RETURNING AND GOING TO THE JEWELER."
1.0,Don't expect any of the ones pictured. I received 100 pieces but not a single one of them was a character of any kind most of them were smaller then a dime. Very disappointed
1.0,Shrunk down two sizes on a cold wash with low setting on the dryer. Was already snug to begin with. All the other clothes I bought came out fine so why is this one a M when I ordered a L
1.0,These are NOT for your eyebrow! They are way too short. They wouldn't fit in my ear cartilage piercing or in my ear lobe. I threw them out.
1.0,fits like glove a tight glove
1.0,Ended up returning it. Leather was breaking apart and didn't look the best.
1.0,Looks cheap.  Fabric quality looks extremely synthetic and cheap.
1.0,Cheaply made; broke after a couple of days wearing them. Cute but thats about all.
1.0,It broke within 5 minutes of wearing it.
1.0,One shoe fit and the other was way too small.
1.0,Size was ok. But numbers are missing and some duplicated
1.0,I ordered blue tint and received yellow tint. I can return and but can’t get the same 9.95 price. Stuck with yellow tint.
1.0,This is one cheaply made hat. And NVER SMALL. Will not fit my 7 yes old. Do not waste your money. I don't think it will make it through one wash
1.0,"Take a look at the length of these pants. The waist is great, 32 = 32.8 inches. The length? 41 inches.<br /><br />No one in the right height would ever have 41 inch legs with a 32 inch waist."
1.0,Fabric was lightweight but felt like plastic. Way too small. Returned.
1.0,Nice design.  Size large to tight on my petite mother in law.
1.0,"came Bent, and the banwas not attached. I was so disappointed I just threw it I. The trash. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"I’m so disappointed in this purchase. The item is not as pictured. The pajamas in the picture are Sleepyheads Polar Bear pajamas. I bought myself and my kids the Sleepyheads set, but I had to purchase my husbands pajamas from this vendor because the other vendor didn’t have his size. I was nervous purchasing the set from two different vendors but figured it would be okay as long as the item looks as pictured. I’m attaching pictures to this comment so you can see the differences between the items. The gray color is darker, the bears on the pants are larger and the design is different. I’m putting a pair of my pants next to my husbands for comparison. Additionally, the bear and text on the shirt are noticeably not centered. The shirt also arrived very wrinkled and the stitching on the collar is poor."
1.0,The knot comes undone even on a tiny wrist
1.0,"I ordered these once, and they were perfect--thick, absorbent, gleaming white and new, and came in a package like a normal product.<br /><br />Since I liked them so much, I ordered a second batch. That batch came wadded up in an envelope, thin, stretched out, dirty and clearly used. Not worth it to send back, but I'm pretty repulsed. Don't buy this garbage."
1.0,It’s thread bare.
1.0,The boots did not fit and looked very plastic-y.
1.0,This is not as described or shown.  The material is a thin cheap looking and feeling dri-fit material.  I am very dissatisfied with this shirt.  I would not recommend or buy again.
1.0,"Fell off immediately.  Returned right away, no way was I going to trust this band with an expensive watch face."
1.0,Poor quality poor quality stoppers they often drop when u put them on poor poor poor waste of money
1.0,"Size was terrible, will give to 5 year old granddaughter. Workmanship was beautiful"
1.0,Outer ring peeling off after one day
1.0,the print is off.. and the material is crap
1.0,"I don't know what the fools selling these shirts take me for, but I'm here to tell you, they look NOTHING like the pictures used to advertise them.  Compare them with the one I just bought.  The cut of the arms, the length, the taper at the waist--EVERYTHING that's visually appealing per the pictures--they're a TOTAL LIE.  This company H2H is basically flipping me two huge birds right now.  I'm quite PO'ed at the moment.."
1.0,The watch is nice. But I purchased 2 & they both had fog under  the glass straight out of the box so they were returned.
1.0,"These are thick (wide) head bands.  A girl probably wouldn't mind, but I personally (as a man) didn't want a headband that covers my entire forehead, which these do."
1.0,It came with a rip
1.0,"THEY GIVE YOU A CAMEL TOE . Idk whos bright idea it was to sow a line right down the hooty who part but it just is uncomfortable and unnecessary :(<br />Over all good leggings other than this , but it ruined them for me ."
1.0,Bought an xl but it fits like a medium. Also the material is too thin to be really called a sweater. I am returning it
1.0,The material is not what I expected and item is too wrinkled. I thought shipping it back is free. I didn't realize I have to pay to ship it back to the vendor.
1.0,The QUALITY was less than expected! Over all a little less generous in size than expected. I fear that with a few washing it will shrink. Some of stitching inferior.
1.0,A lot if the charms were malformed. I don't know if I got the junk bunch but I threw them out.
1.0,The pants are exactly as pictured but the top does not look like the picture. I purchased this for my granddaughter. The top is not as gathered and full as the one in the photo and the back drags the floor when I put it on her. The inside tag in the back is sewn up too high and would scratch the back of her neck. There are long surging strings hanging where they stopped their seams and did not trim. I cut one off the bottom hem that was about 4 inches long.
1.0,Horrible...compare to purchasing from wish.com RETURNED
1.0,Had to return. Too short and boxy. Nothing like the picture.
1.0,XL is a medium<br />Don't bother trying it on
1.0,I wear a large but decided to purchase XL to be on the safe side. This fit like a medium & was too small!!! I’m returning this. Horrible.
1.0,"Ridiculously small. I bought an XXL and normally wear a L/XL. I could barely get it over my chest. Unless you're under 170 pounds, do not buy!!!!"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4d911666e7934da95419f2f379cb8ffd]] No good
1.0,"The fabric is really cheap and transparent, you just can't ware it even if you dont get wet. Don't recommended at all"
1.0,very simple
1.0,"They are so cute, but you get what you pay for. They snapped within 1 week of wearing them. Its too bad because i really loved them."
1.0,The watch is literally broken when I received it . Not at all worth for the money not a buy . Don’t waste your money .
1.0,"Somewhat small.  I'm a 32waist and bought a medium.  I don't think small enough to order a large.  Like the separate pouch, comfortable. Nice waist band. We'll see how they go!<br /><br />Update: If you are anywhere above small in the junk neighborhood and you get an erection while wearing these, there isn't enough material to stretch with it. Kind of uncomfortable unless you don't get excited during the day!<br />Update 11-8-16.  Downgraded to one star.  My balls fall out of the front.  The pouch isn't really big enough for my junk.  And they bunch up in my crack. However, they are still nice soft and smooth."
1.0,NOT so GOOD... Smaller and Tighter than expected ... I used it so i cannot RETURN...
1.0,It was way small and tight turtle neck top which would not even go over my head!!<br />I wear med. normally plus would not let me return it... It was a PRIME item . . Said it would cost to much to return???? Hello PRIME ???<br />My refund was 6.22 and told me to keep or give it away lol.... My 1st real bad experience with Amazon  :(<br />P.S. I order 2 same problem same response sane $6.22 refund
1.0,You get what you pay for. This was horrible.
1.0,"These masks are too small, causing them to pull on your ears and stretch too tight across your face."
1.0,Charm so small lettering was impossible to read.
1.0,"This is super cheap and poorly made, practically tore in half when I put it on. It literally felt like it was made of cheap thin plastic material."
1.0,They are so beautiful but I wore them one day and they are already turning colors.
1.0,"Super cheap quality fabric. Zero stars. Extremely low quality, cheap fabric, this is definitely not what i anticipated. I will be returning this product. So so trashy!!! A far cry from what the photos depict."
1.0,I ordered the blue on the picture and the blue I received was a much darker blue. Not flattering at all. Not even close to the picture. I wish they would use normal people instead of size 2 models in the pictures.
1.0,I was expecting it to be more pink.  It looks almost white.  Not very happy with this.
1.0,It doesn't work. I work outside in all weather and this product do not help my glasses from fogging. My job is very hazardous and my sight is very important. I was so disappointed.
1.0,"This tee shirt is not 80% cotton as advertised when purchasing. In the shirt itself the manufacturer claims its 65% cotton. I also doubt that that is true. This tee shirt feels like it made from a plastic material, and is definitely not a breathable material."
1.0,"VERY hard to open. Even HARDER to close after on ear! Very HEAVY in weight for lobes, also!"
1.0,Fabric is very cheep quality.
1.0,It broke after playing with it once.  What a waste.
1.0,Broke instantly!! Never got to wear it 😡
1.0,"tiny head, too small to use."
1.0,Broke my arm out horrible
1.0,Right out of the box and the battery is completely dead.
1.0,"Im a 20 bottom, 36/40 G/H cup. I got the XXL size. This did not work. I was looking for a swimsuit that would be more full coverage without having to wear a one piece, but Im not going to find that with this suit. The bottoms got up to my knee and I had to call quits cuz I just knew it wasnt going to fit at that point. I was able to get the top on but I was spilling out of both sides like a cannoli. There was also an issue in a spot with the patterning like it was super light in a spot like the dye didnt take or something (I got the purple palm-tree type pattern)... idk if it fit I think I could over look that though..."
1.0,Took it out of the package and the pin was out of the watch band.  Watch fell apart before I even wore it
1.0,Poorly made. Cheap flimsy fabric. I do not recommend.
1.0,Really likes the look but it was too boxy
1.0,Way to small and not as described
1.0,This was shapeless and looked as cheap as it is. I got what I paid for and I’m returning it
1.0,Loved the color but these are thin and see through.  I had on a nude color underwear and you could see them as if I wasn’t wearing pants! See through from all sides! Awful. The quality in the fabric just isn’t there. I ordered the size I always wear.  I returned these.
1.0,I washed it one time and all the seams started coming apart I bought 2 of the shirts and they suck
1.0,They are way too heavy and hurt my ears terribly to wear them. :(
1.0,Not breathable and to small .
1.0,"I'm 5 ft 2 in, 125 pounds, so I bought a medium which is my typical size. Looked more like an extra small! I couldn't even get the top on (which never happens) much less the bottoms. It looked nice, so I recommend buying it but definitely order up...maybe even two sizes up."
1.0,Too small. Wrong fabric
1.0,Missing the “S” in stronger
1.0,Terrible quality!  Bracelet tarnished!!!
1.0,Have had watch for 2 months and the clasp broke - just called Amazon and was told the 2-year warranty only covers the clock portion of the watch and of course it broke right after my return window closed.  So my advice - don't buy it!
1.0,"After a week of having them, they turned my nose green -_-"
1.0,Fell apart after wearing for 5 minutes.
1.0,Prongs didn't fit in band
1.0,"The whole reason I ordered this was because of the poem it showed as being included.  It had a really nice ""daughter-in-law"" poem on the item, but when I got it, there was no mention of it.  It was just a necklace.  Nothing extra-ordinary about it.  It didn't have anything in it talking about a ""special daughter-in-law."" So i am returning it."
1.0,it smells!!!!!!!
1.0,"My mom ordered this ring for me for Christmas. It was nothing like what she ordered. She was expecting one silver skull ring, she got a set of 3 rings. One had a skull and the other two were just bands. Not at all what she ordered. She gave them to me as a Christmas gift, but we were both super disappointed because they weren't at all what I put on my wishlist or what she ordered. Don't order this unless you want a mystery ring showing up to your door."
1.0,The chain not secure.....
1.0,These ran soooo small! And they were paper-thin! Do not waste your money or time on these shorts.
1.0,I should have listened to the other reviews. The sizing is way off the mark and the blouse didn’t even look like the one in the picture. Very cheap fabric and the color isn’t even the same.
1.0,"No no no no, I don't even know what to say...<br />Not as pictured, looks like a dentist bid."
1.0,I hated the whole product because it was not what I ordered. I ordered the mermaid pants with the scales on it and got these pretty cheap plastic purple pants with wrinkly flares that look like crap. Nothing about this item is what I ordered and they also stretch out completely so it looks like I have crap in my pants in a baggie butt
1.0,These were described as earrings but when I got them the posts were larger than my holes. They also felt very heavy when I was wearing them and before even having them in for eight hours I had to take them out because my ears were hurting me. After removing them my earlobes were red and the next day they had small scabby areas around the holes.
1.0,Fit very weird! It’s meant for someone with a VERY short torso. My daughter (who does not have difficulty fitting her torso in other clothing items) had this fitting very uncomfortably on her.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. The dress was short and the top was cris cross. Not the dress I ordered
1.0,"I’ve ordered cosplays for my daughter on Amazon many times. Usually the more you spend, a little better the outfit. Not in this case. I will be returning. My daughter wears a Medium typically and large usually in cosplay. But reading reviews, I decided with an XL. It was to so tight in the shorts."
1.0,These Sunglasses broke within a week of use. The screw fell out of one of the legs.
1.0,Watch to heavy and too small.  Company will not respond to give address for return and refund.
1.0,the hat pictured is NOT what comes. a brown hat comes. I have contacted the seller but no reply. The green is called altitude the brown is called highlander. the fastening on the rear is also NOT what is shown. and I have a 71/4 head size and I max it out.
1.0,worst quality
1.0,"these are not correctly sized, at least the pair i received."
1.0,"Triste por q me llegó rallado, no se porque"
1.0,"Did not fit, it says fits all I am not a big person i opulent get it to wrap around me!"
1.0,Nice for the optics. Not good for practical use. I used them on my CSI work keys and the cloth was frayed within 2 weeks.
1.0,Bought as a gift did not  come with a waist band  ..... lame let down gift
1.0,Ordered a 3x and it was more like a medium
1.0,hated hated hated.  Not at all what I expected.  The material is extremely thin.  They are HUGE.
1.0,Broke in 4months. Was a gift for my daughter and she loved it. She didn’t wear it everyday but frequently. No extreme conditions or being rough with it. Sadly and to her great disappointment it broke after only 4 months. She wants another but for obvious reasons I don’t want to invest in another. Afraid it will happen again.
1.0,I returned it. The actual bracelet did not look like the picture.
1.0,"Not a  bad deal if you don't mind trimming the excess material and reinforcing the weak seams, particularly in the finger tips. East to do, but it's time consuming. Given the description, at the very least, there shouldn't be a quarter inch of material in the seams. It really disturbs the appearance of the gloves, and makes it obvious that they're just cheap throw aways. Nowhere near what you might wear to a funeral or other formal occasion. Either change the description, of trim the fluff."
1.0,"Do not like this outfit at all the material is too thin and cheap. It makes a lot of noise when you walk it’s larger than what the size chart says so order a size down. I’m 150 pounds and 5 foot seven ordered a medium if you are that size, get a small one I got was to baggie and I just don’t like it at all will not be wearing it."
1.0,Turned to a dark nasty color after wearing it three times.
1.0,these did not ever arrive. The order was hard to cancel.  Waste of time.
1.0,not what i expected  tarnished
1.0,"Runs very small, doesn't not match size chart provided. Disappointed."
1.0,They run big size down whole size
1.0,Pants too big asked for a small never got a reply need a size that's fits or a refund !
1.0,Nice design but very cheaply made. The frames were already broken when I received them.
1.0,"I bought this thinking it would be a light weight method of carrying all the wires I have.  I travel a lot so I have a laptop, GPS, Blackberry and an external mouse device for presentations.  The Grid It did a fine job of holding all of the equipment I carry.  It was however, heavier than I expected.  The reason I am rating it only one STAR  is because I have had it for only a month and the zipper pouch on the back of the Grid It ripped open at the bottom.  The only thing I had in there were 4 little thumb drives.  I nearly lost them in the rental car when they all fell out.  I will be returning the product.  My suggestion for the product is to forget about the zipper on the back and just simply enclose the whole thing.  That way items would stay in place with the rubber straps and anything small can be enclosed as well."
1.0,I ordered a 2XL sizing up from my usual XL and they were way too small and just from pulling them out of the packaging you could tell that they were not a solid color at all they are more like tights than leggings. Very disappointed currently asking from a return.
1.0,Large was too big for my 25” hard sided suitcase. It dragged on the ground and got stuck in the wheels.
1.0,Cannot get them on. Way too tight..
1.0,Cheap Chinese product.
1.0,Panties are to small
1.0,this shirt is comically small!!! this would fit my 11 year old niece!!!
1.0,Necklace fell apart ever time I touched it. Sorry I even bought it. I would send it back but it would cost more than it did to actually buy it. Save your money.
1.0,I ordered 2 of these and one came with a broken locket and the second bracelet broke the next day.
1.0,Se despintan las piedras
1.0,"When i purchased them I made the mistake of not reading the reviews. The earrings are baby hoops smaller than a penny. It does look like the picture,not what i expected."
1.0,"Too small, material was not at all breathable"
1.0,"Product does not look like picture, do not like."
1.0,Doesn't stay in your nose
1.0,Do not order. Misleading. No batteries or charger included in package even though advertised with 2 batteries and charger.
1.0,I bought this purse had it maybe a month and the strap broke  and could not get it returned.
1.0,This is crap! Don’t buy it.
1.0,"Can't stand putting these on my feet.  They are way too tight, and won't stretch."
1.0,exactly that.
1.0,Wore once. Irritated skin under eyes.
1.0,"In order for you to see using the 2.5 magnification portion of the glasses, I had to tip my head way back.  I could not just shift my eyes to the bottom portion, because it was a very thin part at the bottom that had it.  Therefore, I find the glasses not very funtional."
1.0,"Size way up, cheap material. Had to send it back."
1.0,Cheap...Won't close...Don't buy
1.0,Was so excited to get this dress then utter disappointment!! Looks terrible..shorter than expected and if you have any boobs..expect them to hang out..ordered XXL and can't return it.
1.0,"These shorts are the WORST. They’re thick, weird material, and they awkwardly crease in the front whenever you bend. I can’t stand them, they fit so strangely, I’ll never wear them again. Total waste of money."
1.0,"I am a size 6-8 in pants... usually a size medium. I ordered the largest size because of the reviews and they were SO SMALL!! Like, So small I questioned whether or not these were children’s shorts. The pattern that came to me was nothing like the one in the picture, but it was really cute so I thought I’d give them a try. The second day I wore them, they ripped right up the crotch.  Do yourself a favor & don’t buy these shorts."
1.0,The mask in the photo is nothing like the one we received. The description is silver metal and there’s blues and pinks in the mask. Not at all glittery or sparkly as the picture shows.
1.0,Alright so I am a 5'4 170 pound gal with a booty. I got the 13 even though I wear an 11. The material smelled like gasoline and it was not cotton. Like polyester and spandax. I received the zipper broken as well. Have returned.
1.0,The dress was cute but the straps kept breaking/ripping. Really annoying to be walking around and have your strap snap
1.0,"This looked so sexy and cute,i was soo disappointed in how small it was. If you order this try 2 sizes up."
1.0,The material felt nice but my hands turned black from touching it! DO NOT BUY.
1.0,"Stopped working after the 2nd day! Horrible shoes. Horrible company!<br /><br />My 7 year old spent his hard-earned money to buy these shoes. He has been wanting them for about a year. He eagerly chose these shoes and then waited and waited for them to come. They FINALLY came and he was thrilled!  The lights were impressive - bright, multi colored options, rechargeable, and soooooo cool.  He was extremely excited to wear them to school.  He stopped everyone to show them off. On the second day, though, he came home from school saying one didn't work.  We tried charging them, wiggling the cord to see if there's a short, switching charging ports -- all to no avail. He was so disappointed. He cried when I told him we had to send them back.<br /><br />As for the company, I tried contacting them several times.  I am getting email responses,  but I suspect that they are computer generated. They are brief, and fail to address what I have asked.<br /><br />I can return the product, but I have to pay the shipping! Really?! THEY sent me a faulty product, but I have to pay to return it. Time, energy, and money wasted.<br /><br />If I could give this experience a zero, I would.  DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!<br /><br />Update- it cost us $8.00 to mail them back, and the company did NOT refund us the money for the shoes!!! 😡 So we are out the cost of the shoes, the cost of the shipping, and all we received was a whole lot of frustration!"
1.0,Third pair no nose rubber things. You can’t wear them without
1.0,Kids loved the design but these were really heavy and broke within 2 months. For the price I expected them to last.
1.0,Did not look like picture. Was suppose to be gift for my son.  Big white rectangle on front. Super waste of money
1.0,Terribly uncomfortable. Your foot slides all over.
1.0,This product is a complete knock off with inferior fabric.  It isn't even labeled for sale in the US
1.0,way too short to hold my sons tie. Garbage !!
1.0,"Cheap jewelry, not really jade. The metal design is glued to the so called jade stone. Sooner or later it will come apart."
1.0,Strap broke first day.  Color was not like picture.
1.0,"Look great, super clear, but lenses cracked after 2 months. There was nothing that hit them and I handled with the upmost care. When talking with some friends they had similar issues. After contacting Costa the CS said that they had been getting a lot of complaints of this issue and did a warranty repair order saying that it should be covered. This was 10/10/2016, today 11/10/2016 they email that they are not covered and will cost $89 to fix plus $10 shipping. When called the repair number given in email to ask questions I gave up after being on hold for 30 min."
1.0,Arrived already broken... Useless.
1.0,"Material is nowhere near as the ones in the picture, the size is waaaay off I ordered S and the Small is way too big it could pass as L. Total waste of money I'm returning it."
1.0,"They fit true to size, and seemed comfortable.  However, the white part turned very yellow, and they take a very long time to dry.  I live in the south, and in the summer I leave them outside in the sun on my balcony all day and the still don’t dry out! It’s actually very strange and there may be an application in material science that would find this mesh fabric that retains water literally for days useful.  It is clearly a bad choice for toddler water shoes, though.  I hate them.  By the way this is my experience With these shoes for not quite 2 months of not daily use."
1.0,"Please don't buy.  After having it for less than  two weeks, it has stretched so much. It drops down and roll up to my ankles. A waste of money. This is an honest review because I rely on reviews to buy on Amazon also."
1.0,I don't know the item missing .
1.0,"Horrible! I really tried to like it, but it was much more floppier than the photo. Yuck"
1.0,"Cheap, flimsy post bent first time I tried to put the backer on. Returning. Can get better ones at Target! Also a little larger than expected. ZERO STARS!!!"
1.0,"Does not stay. Followed instructions and cleaned off brand new PS4 and after a little bit of gaming, the decals on all sides came off and bubbled like crazy.. Tried pressing back on and it didn't stay.. I do not recommend getting this, unless you like the peeled look."
1.0,Not as long as the pic and too small sending this item back
1.0,This was probably the least terrible of several rose gold masks I ordered for a wedding. The problem is that this isn’t metallic. It’s a photo print of something metallic. So it’s less than great.
1.0,Demasiado grande!!!<br />Con tanta ilusión que lo pedí y me queda peor que una vara.
1.0,Does NOT have pads to put the oil on!! Putting oil directly in necklace as designed WASTES the oil because it spills out of the holes onto your clothes!  Necklace itself feels cheap. VERY lightweight and I'm concerned over the necklace breaking.
1.0,These pants would be cute on someone with a bit of height. They’re super soft and comfortable and I wanted them to work but I’m too short. I tried cuffing them even and they are still too baggy and loose where it looked like I was larger than I am. Not flattering for the short petite frame.
1.0,Extremely difficult to get on & off. Won't wear it as I don't want to sleep with it on.
1.0,I was really excited to purchase this for a little girl who loves Cinderella. The price was amazing for all the pieces you get. Upon arrival I took it out of the bag. The sizing is hard to understand so I googled it to see exactly what I needed. This was a tiny dress!!! I sent it back the next day. The size I was suppose to get was a 10. There was no way it was a 10.
1.0,Not what I expected it was too large it looked like a house dress
1.0,Cute but suuuuuuuuper small. Order 3 sizes larger than usual.
1.0,"Received a PD&amp;C shirt (Paper Denim &amp; Cloth) which is an entirely different company.<br /><br />I happen to like PD&amp;C shirts, but for someone expecting UrbanCrews shirts this is definitely not it. Please be aware that and warned that you should expect PD&amp;C product and not Urban Crews.<br /><br />The one star is for false advertisement."
1.0,I ordered the item for a masquerade gala in a couple of weeks. The item arrived broken in two. It isn't eligible for return.
1.0,"It changes color when I look through them inside of my car and looking at certain things.  Hope this is not damaging for my eyes but I'd not recommend this to any of my friends and families.  By the time I use it, it's pass the one month return mark so they are just sitting in my car not being used."
1.0,Fits as expected. Size is correct. Comfortable material.
1.0,This is not fair
1.0,the belt does not fit a 40 inch waist rather it fits a 34 inch waist. I gave it to my grandson who has a 34 inch waist...it fits him.
1.0,"This shoe was Too big and very hot on the feet, very uncomfortable in 5 minutes. I would not recommend them at all"
1.0,Looks like size XL when I ordered size Small
1.0,Not made for women with a cup size bigger than a B.
1.0,"See thru material, although<br />pretty you definitely need a slip to be able to wear out in public."
1.0,Practically impossible to keep on your head bc of the weight of all that brim.  Also not a very good hat if your head isn't small.
1.0,Little disappointed. Daughter received gift card and wanted to be grown up a little.<br />Three items arrived. Expensive for what you will receive. My fault for not paying attention to the quantity of items for 18.00.<br />Not buying from Noa store again.
1.0,battery died
1.0,Terrible! Broke the first time i put it on.
1.0,Horrible quality. They are so thin that are transparent and break really easily.
1.0,I got this a few minutes ago from my porch and opened it. It looked cute and all so I went to go separate the black one from the white one but the magnets wouldn't separate. So I tried prying them apart without breaking them off the bracelets but in the end the did break off. I still then couldn't separate the magnets. I used flat tools to try to separate them and had no luck. They finally separated after I whacked them 3 times with a hammer. They looked as though they were melted together just slightly on the inside lip. So it broke before I could give either bracelets to my girlfriend. Not a good buy.
1.0,It was NOT 3/4 sleeved??? Otherwise fit fine.
1.0,"Not even close on the sizing. They seem nice but unless you can buy 4 sizes bigger than what you normally wear, the average American is not going to fit in these"
1.0,"Complete junk. Awful material, very poor quality."
1.0,"The jewelry quality is very good however, the hole hasn’t enough Diameter for pandora bracelet. I have to enlarge it. I recommend to buy pandora original."
1.0,These are the worse things that call themselves socks that I’ve ever bought in my life.  I will never purchase anything similar to these again. Very disappointed
1.0,Too small and a wierd uneven line running the length of 1 sock. These were so small that they did not even come up to mid calf.
1.0,Item huge and cheap
1.0,Looks like plastic beads
1.0,Not a good purchase. They turned black. Very disappointing
1.0,This product is Smudged  together and does not look good
1.0,Seamless means seamless and it is not!<br />Advertising do not xorrespond with this product
1.0,Waaay too small!!! Not true to size. I ordered one size up.
1.0,I placed an order for the Gold model with white soles!! And I received a silver one with silver soles!!!
1.0,"Unflattering fit, material too sheer"
1.0,I purchased 4 to give as gifts. I was excited to open the box. The chain is beautiful and the pearl is pretty as well but the chain is completely knotted up. I opened up 2 out of 4 boxes and decided to send them back.
1.0,"Item quality and material is very bad and cheap kind of. The finishing and stitches were very imperfect, the bottom piece was very badly stitched and designed. And the Top part attached with lace is very delicate and worst finishing."
1.0,"It was stiff when I received, so I hand washed it and line dried. It shrunk!!!"
1.0,I received only 1 paid of socks. The picture showed 3.
1.0,CHEAP QUALITY
1.0,Earrings do not look like the picture. They were supposed to look like multiple piercings going up the ear. But the earrings hung down instead. Did not look like the picture on Amazon at all! Very disappointed!
1.0,"Do not like, I wouldn’t buy these again. Very cheaply made and will not support bigger clothes"
1.0,NEVER LIT UP. We put brand new unexpired batteries and tried over and over again and it never lit up
1.0,"Horrible. So thin. Was just a printed pattern on thin material. Couldn't have passed these off as ""jeans"" or even close to acceptable leggings."
1.0,Fits small and horrible quality. I returned for a refund.
1.0,Save your money and don’t buy these cheap gloves. The grip on the gloves come off after two times of wearing. Very poor quality.
1.0,I did not receive the correct item. Not a scarf clip. Some lion men’s ring. I cannot return. Need it fixed immediately.
1.0,"Do not waste your money, these sizes are inaccurate, I’m should have checked out the reviews."
1.0,Glass came off after 2 days very disappointing
1.0,"The mask does not breath well, too thick, and the strips break very easily"
1.0,the balls wont stay on
1.0,Hurts baby toes
1.0,the band is too lightweight/flimsy to actually hold the watch in place without fear of damaging it.
1.0,was really much smaller than i expected
1.0,Compré este producto y me vino dañado pedí un cambio y también vino dañado. Al final pedí me reembolso. No vale la pena.
1.0,"Cheap material, poor quality, horrible customer service and it doesn't look the same in person. Buyer Beware"
1.0,"Fits like a tank top, the sports bra is not tight at all."
1.0,This jacket runs extremely small.
1.0,Very cheap. Looks nothing like the picture. Was so looking forward to these pants:( wouldn’t recommend
1.0,Disappointed to receive bent posts on the earrings. One would think a once over should be done before shipping. Sending these back.
1.0,Typo. Should say “first” but says “firsy”. Requested replacement and it said the same!!
1.0,"THIS JACKET HAD TO BE 3 SIZES TOO SMALL, THE MATERIAL WAS THIN AND CHEAP DENIM. THERE WERE STRINGS JUST HANGING ALL OVER THE INSIDE OF THE JACKET. TERRIBLE WORKMANSHIP. I WOULD BE DISHONERED IF MY COMPANY MAILED A PRODUCT OF THIS QUALITY."
1.0,"*UPDATE* I gave it a chance and after setting it on my counter the back popped off. When attempting to put it back on, it crumbled like tissue paper. I would suggest you never do business with this seller again. Pure garbage.<br /><br />It looks ok and meets the aesthetic standard I want. However, it randomly stopped functioning within 24 hours. It can't be that hard to put a decent battery in a watch."
1.0,Has a horrid chemical smell that makes it impossible to wear.  Not happy with this purchase at all...would give no starts if at all possible.
1.0,"If I had known this blouse was coming from China I never would have ordered it.  I did order a XXL and it was way too small ( I'm an 18).  This would not fit my 11 yr. old granddaughter. To mail this back to China would cost too much, so I will donate it."
1.0,"This shirt is the ugliest piece of clothing I have ever seen, made from the lowest quality materials I have ever seen. It looks nothing like the picture. The return policy is such that it costs more to send it back than it was purchased for. This product and company are exactly why people are, and should, be hesitant to buy clothing online. The quality is so poor that you can't even use it as a rag, it might work as sandpaper."
1.0,The fit was not good and the fabric left a lot to be desired.  This was returned
1.0,The watch band wouldn't stay or connect with the watch.  I purchased 3 and only 1 worked and one was missing the little piece that holds the watch band in place.
1.0,"It smells , it doesn’t look as good as the photo and looks very cheap . Disappointed."
1.0,"I wear a size large and purchased in a xxl because I knew I wanted oversized.  This was tight. The sewing wasn’t good with a lot of threads everywhere. The material was a cotton t shirt and not a sweater or sweatshirt material.  Not worth it, returned next day."
1.0,"If I could do no stars I would. I have purchased from this seller before and I got the two tone pro diver with the blue bezel and it came in a nice box with a pillow and it was good quality everything was great. I ordered my older brother one a couple weeks after and again nice box with the pillow great watch. I ordered one a couple days ago and the first thing I noticed was the box, cheap cardboard, there was no pillow another piece of cardboard. The watch felt cheap, the clasp was backwards compared to the first real one, the Invicta label was crooked, the dial notches we're not as smooth and clean as they are on the real one. The clicks when you turn it are loud not smooth, the pins on the real one are easy to remove to size the watch on the fake one you can not get them out, there's just alot of stuff wrong. I requested a replacement and hopefully it's real this time. In the pictures the real one is on the left."
1.0,"This product is way too small, and so thin that it is see through"
1.0,GAVE IT AWAY
1.0,doesn’t sit right on the face
1.0,Broke right when I opened the item
1.0,Yucky color pink. I thought it was a soft ballet pink. Too small too. Buy a size up than you normally wear.
1.0,"Way too small, I should of known"
1.0,Ordered the 2pack rec’d only 1shirt. Not happy
1.0,Very nice looking necklace and lots of compliments when I wear it the first time I will not be wearing it again it itches my neck so bad and leave some marks on me.I have to use the cortisone 10 to ease  the itching
1.0,"To me, the dress is hideous...but that's mostly because of the material and the way it falls. If you're a size two it probably is just fine."
1.0,Came extremely late. The fabric that the masks were made of resembled the fabric from a woman's slip.
1.0,Thighs did not fit. I always fit a 2x or smaller and this was not it.
1.0,"This hat looks nothing like pictured. The brim is much smaller, looks like Gilligan's hat. I ordered a 2x for my husband and it fits smaller than the &#34;one size fits most&#34; hats at Walmart. This will be going back"
1.0,The waist was entirely out of proportion and not loose as shown in the photo.
1.0,I threw it away after the stone fell out.
1.0,It broke in less than a week
1.0,Slippery material makes it very worthless to prevent anything. Clearly see light when held up. Needs wire to keep from fogging glasses. Won’t buy again because eit doesn’t do it’s job.
1.0,"Loved the necklace and the idea. But the chain broke after only a few weeks of use. Pretty disappointing, but will try another brand and hopefully it'll stick."
1.0,"great design, cheap manufacturing. I ended up with a rash from it so I can't wear it. Not sure if it was the pendant or chain"
1.0,It was a cute 👗 but it didn't compliment me
1.0,Started out good but turned black quickly.
1.0,"I typically wear an XL, which is a 14-16 (5' 3"", 173lbs) I ordered an XL here, and the product arrived with a sticker on it that says 12. Of course, it doesn't fit. It feels like a 10. I'll have to send it back. I really doubt the XXL will fit."
1.0,I ordered larger and it was still to small. I am 5'5&#34; and they were too short.
1.0,The material is a cheap polyester/shiny material that is like the design is stamped ? on.  Fit ok.  Just looks cheap and not very comfortable.  I returned it .  Not what I expected.
1.0,It came busted the bracket was in two pieces
1.0,Very awkward fit. Do not recommend.
1.0,"The material is so thin, you could see the outline of my undergarments and every single line showed through the fabric. I’m going to return it."
1.0,I bought this for Christmas and it was HUGE and way to long for my liking. The material was also weird...Look like they were running out of in when they printed the one I received.
1.0,The cap was HUGE. No structure...which ment the music was spotty.... if this was for a teen it had to be a monster size kid.. my condolences to the mother.
1.0,"Thin,  cheap material,  and WAY too small to be a ONE SIZE FITS ALL. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"Very poor quality , ripped soon after I received it."
1.0,"The color does not match AT ALL. the brown pictured is much more leathery and less orange than what arrived. Also the photos show a more rigid hood, it is very floppy.<br /><br />It's a fine low price alternative but not for what I thought I was getting.  The inside is lined black, in the photo it appears to be a solid brown.<br /><br />It's generally an okay low quality SOFT FABRIC cowl. If you want more rigidity look elsewhere"
1.0,Returned.  Too small.  Please review your sizing charts.
1.0,I was not expecting these pants to be so rigid and heavy. Very disappointed with this model from Duluth.
1.0,They don’t fit well on glasses frames and won’t protect my eyes
1.0,It's not size 7 to 8 its more like 5 to 6 do not buy the seller published wrong information.
1.0,"From the image it looks like a deep red. When you receive it the color is a bright, distracting, unflattering red. If you are looking for a modest “Where’s Waldo” costume, this dress is for you."
1.0,"When this product first arrived I was thrilled they were super cute, fit my wrist and my galaxy fit perfectly and overall were just comfy. However after the first few days my wrist started to hurt I took the watch off to discover I had what looked and felt like chemical burns on my wrist. I thought maybe I had just worn the watch on the same wrist to long irritating the skin and gotten cleaning supplies on it at some point causing the burn so I switched wrists only to discover the same thing happened to the other wrist and I realized it was the band causing some kind of burns! To be fair I do have sensitive skin but I've never had this issue with watch bands like this before. My wrist was red hot, the skin was tight and itchy, and hurt to shower or wear long sleeves for a week after I took the bands off. Overall I'm disappointed in this product, if you have sensitive skin beware!"
1.0,Sizing is off. I ordered an XL and I usually wear a medium and it was so small!!!
1.0,Super soft...but my seams ripped open after 2 days of wearing them. I decided to keep them and take them to a seamstress. But not happy with these
1.0,Very disappointed these masks are huge they don’t fit my face as an adult my 9 year old or my 6 year old waste of money
1.0,Size is totally wrong. XL is more like kids sizes.  Also is shipped out of China.  Took about 30 days to receive.  And now have to return.  Don’t waste your money or time.  Shame for Amazon even listing these.  Total garbage
1.0,"The fit is okay, but I ordered this dress in red (as shown) and what I received was maroon. Disappointed & returning."
1.0,I asked for it for my daughter's birthday and it did not turn out to be as beautiful as it is seen in the image of the purchase it is very different when you have it with you not convinced on the contrary this product is a disappointment for me and the worst thing is that I had to pay so much to  to have it for the exact day of the birthday
1.0,Rather flimsy and they did not last very long before coming apart.
1.0,This started turning colors lessthan aweek after I got it and was not as pictured<br />😀😄
1.0,Very cute but fits more like a 4T instead of a 5T  and will probably shrink when I wash it
1.0,"This order was very small compression hose...I need the ones For xtra large...I donated the little ones to my friend...need,men's?"
1.0,The colors run.
1.0,"I love the chocked but it’s not glass beads, still looks nice feels durable"
1.0,"Sadly I like my set to be close to my neck and not hanging below my chest, so as I adjust these I have these hanging lines that hang behind my back or go forward all the time.<br />If these would have been adjusted so well like others I have bought here in Amazon with knots that adjust everything perfectly without leaving two hanging lines, I would have not thrown them to the trash.<br />To be fair though, these are beautiful and well made, I just did not want to cut the lines and do knots myself to adjust it, or try and search online for easy knots that can help me move the pendulum up and done keeping me from cutting anything.<br /><br />By all means, I know I am picky and do not like to feel like doing something else on something I bought if I paid for it. One star because it at least feels like most people will love this. Totally recommend it for others."
1.0,Looks very cheap hem is completely off on the empire waist wouldn’t buy this again
1.0,Junk don't waist your money!
1.0,arrived with a broken handle
1.0,Not as advertised material is cheap see through try to return and was told its to much to send back keep it and we will send you 3 bucks ?? Wtf?
1.0,"I bought some of these Skidders at a thrift store and they were great for my grandson who loves to get wet and muddy. Just throw them in the wash and let dry. He can run all around the yard, through grass, pebbles and wood chips. So that is a great feature. I came here to order more and since he loves trucks and cars, ordered that style. Didn't get them. Got basketballs instead. VERY disappointed. If the company wants to advertise and sell here they need to be fair. Advertise them as &#34;Let us choose a great design for you!&#34;  OR, &#34;At this price, designs are not guaranteed&#34;. I sent them back. One star rating for misleading advertising. Five stars for the product itself."
1.0,"I usually wear an L and decided to get an XXL because I love my rompers to be loose and not form fitting. First this was skin tight on me and the material is a stretchy sticky kind. when I put it on, the fabric was transparent around my chest and my rear area despite it being dark blue. It seems badly sewn together and it doesn't have the brand tag, just the size tag."
1.0,Nice earnings but I so upset because I Received two of the same. three sets but two of the same ugh 😩
1.0,fabric quality and stitching is sub-par at best. the &#34;white&#34; skull was already bled through and bright pink when I took it out of the package.
1.0,Dress ran small and the material was thin enough to read print through. I have to wear a cami and a full slip to my knees minimum underneath
1.0,Rolls up and down. Pointless.
1.0,One of the zippers broke almost immediately. Tossed it a few months after I bought it. Terrible.
1.0,"I have a very expensive all brass floor lamp that seems to need a lot of polishing. I’ve been using Twinkle Brass and Silver polish. While that works, it’s messy!  So I decided to try these specially treated cloths on my lamp. I used the white side. Nothing. I dampened the white side of the cloth. Nothing.  It literally does NOTHING to get the tarnish off.  While it may work on other metals, that’s not why I bought the cloth. I’m so disappointed."
1.0,Very very cheap quality. Not at all like the picture and runs too small.
1.0,I didn’t like it at all! Plus they were too small. The size guide when I chose Xl the chart requested I needed a large. So I thought it ran bigger in size. I was wrong I needed an extra large!
1.0,"They look nice, but don’t last. Thank God you get three at this price because each band only lasts about a month with light wear."
1.0,"These ""transition"" glasses barely tint in direct sunlight. They are useless as reader sunglasses. They were a total waste of money. The hazards of buying online, esp. during a pandemic."
1.0,"They're pretty, but it's very hard to get a hair tie around the bracelets and they don't stay on."
1.0,Very cheaply made. The reader lense is all blurry at any distance. I have others that work great and have had for years. These will be lucky to last a month.
1.0,defective product
1.0,Proportions are way off on this dress. Don’t even bother trying to “make it work.”  Bought this before the whole COVID-19 thing and was going to return it but then it was too much of a hassle. It is for real not made for a woman’s body.
1.0,"Complete piece of Chinese junk. I've worn them--gently and indoors--for a couple of weeks. The tongue is completely splitting away from the bottom of the slipper on one of them! I might get another week or so worth of wear out of them, then they're going in the trash. Don't waste your money."
1.0,el paquete nunca llego.
1.0,Cheap material..Ugly in person.
1.0,Doesn't fit right. Looks cheap
1.0,Material was so uncomfortable. Didn’t look like the picture.
1.0,Pulled out the stem to set the time and it just came right out.  Not worth the effort to return it.  Glad it was on sale.
1.0,"cheap, poor quality"
1.0,It literally started falling off as soon as the look I was going for was completed
1.0,Doesn't lie straight down. Veers to the side
1.0,Loved the colors but the strap broke with less than a months wear on it.
1.0,"None of the watches worked, and 2 of them also had closed holes."
1.0,"Garbage. Save your money. He chose the olive green with orange inside to wear when he opened the box yesterday. While my husband say that it is comfortable and the size is great, the outer olive green color started rubbing off the ring in less than a day - literally put it on after work yesterday and this is what it looks like this morning."
1.0,These paints are a rip off I bought an extra large and they fit like a med-small😤
1.0,I feel as if I stole this dress from a clown Nd an wearing it. Polka dots are HUGE!  Anti-glamorous. Pockets at the Hops Dd inched I don’t need at my hips. Horrible.
1.0,Was waty to small
1.0,"Topaz is NOVEMBER'S birthstone, not December's. I did not know this until after ordering it as a gift for someone with a December birthday - frustrating! Also it does not come a box - comes in a tiny, plastic baggie& sent in an envelope with no protection. The pendant itself looks ok. The chain looks super cheap & like it would easily break. Disappointed, will be returning."
1.0,These are not SETS...individual earrings...I plan to return
1.0,"- thin fabric<br />- measurements chart is inaccurate, a large should have fit me with room to spare. I could  barely button this shirt.<br />-photos make the lines on the shirt look reflective, they aren't"
1.0,Super cheap and thin
1.0,Poorly constructed. The bodice section is way too short. Not wearable. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere.
1.0,The material in the picture is nowhere near the material i received. I was ok with the price as pictured but what i received resembles what I use as rags. Not happy at all.
1.0,Very cheap cardboard
1.0,Excited to get these but they came scratched...it is a design flaw that needs to be redesigned
1.0,The style is extremely weird. There is no way it would look good on any person. The fabric is cheap looking. Do not waste your money.
1.0,I couldn't get my foot in this shoe.  I had to return it.
1.0,Starting pilling almost immediately after one wear. I’ve had it for a little over a month now and the front is covered. Sad because it’s such a cute fit!
1.0,Extremely small. Extremely see through.
1.0,"For reference: I am 5’7”, 34” bust, 29” waist, and 39” hips,140lbs. Material is clingy and cheap feeling, it does stretch but was very small. I usually wear a size 2 jean and the mediums were too tight around the bottom. I was so disappointed with the bottoms I didn’t even bother trying on the top. Looks way cuter in the photo, than the actual product."
1.0,I ordered a XXL in the hopes that it would be alittle big but in fact it is way to small! So sad and disappointed 😔
1.0,"I have owned it less than three months, and the logo, lettering, and red coating already worn off."
1.0,"Made of a very cheap material, it din't fit  on me, the size of this hat  is too large for a general head size.<br />Obviously for the price i din't expect to be better then that.. i was just trying ..."
1.0,Faded to soon
1.0,Items are broken
1.0,To large for my girlfriend. She is 5'4&#34; and the legs went up past her waist and the top went up above her breast.
1.0,It's a dupe of the photo. Absolutely horrendous
1.0,Pins too short ...replacement band doesn't fit the watch!!!!
1.0,"Took forever to receive these rings.<br />The pics show all 4 being worn at the same time, on different fingers. This isn't possible for most people because they're all the same size. I don't know if anyone who wears the same size ring on all 4 fingers of either hand!!"
1.0,It's really small. I ordered a 3x thinking they run small. It's more like a US size Large. It's cute though it fit my friend.
1.0,Color was drastically different and ill fitting - never worn
1.0,"I hate that the pointer finger has the "" I'm touch friendly"" logo on the outside of it. I thought it came off, but it doesn't.  I think if we are all smart enough to use technology, we should be smart enough to know which finger we want to use!!! Waste of money but too much trouble to send back."
1.0,Glasses are very unclear
1.0,The sneakers were hurting my feet too much I couldn't even walk in them there was too tight from the front the side from everywhere too tight
1.0,The pass is like they was me for a clown for the fit two people in the waist and one
1.0,too small and to thick
1.0,Disappointed a lot of money for plastic looking earrings. Difficult to return. Not worth it
1.0,"This material was not as described. It reminds me of the golf shirts my husband wears. Do not buy! It fit way too small under the arms, but it was huge around the neck. Returning."
1.0,I couldn't even get these things on my legs. Waste of money v
1.0,It’s was broken the chain was broken
1.0,I am a size 3x & the 3x I ordered fits like a 1x.
1.0,"Terrible. I returned it. Wobbly, paint was splotchy. Very poor quality."
1.0,I can never tell if the product I'm getting is the one that is one the picture. I bought a grey dress that was too big and now got the black one and this black one is a completely different fabric and doesn't unbutton like the grey dress does and is a bit too small. I have to wear pants or shorts with the dress. I don't think this is a good product and don't recommend it
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Very thin and did not fit to the size as marked. Buttons came off after first try on.
1.0,Entirely too small!
1.0,"The shirt that I got, looks nothing like the shirt in the picture. The material is terrible! Not ribbed at all, and has a very squared look to the bottom. Not happy!"
1.0,Very cheap material. Feels like a dance costume. Do not recommend.
1.0,Poorly cut.  Smaller than stated size.  I think i prefer the BBs over the trunks.  Seems to be more concerned with exaggerating manhood rather than serving an actual purpose.
1.0,"Backpacks were of poor quality.  The colors were not appealing but look all washed out.  They were very thin.  Also the box that they were shipped in was old and ripped apart.  Looked like it had been wet, used, and returned by someone prior.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"Arms too short,  everything else too big. Material looks like a bath rug. I'm returning this."
1.0,"I wasnt able to try it on, due too being ripped."
1.0,Poor quality straps broken
1.0,Product doesnt work. No light when opened or touched. Opened up case to check the batteries. Removed and re inserted but still no light.
1.0,The mask came broken. The tab on one side was broken off the mask prior to shipping because it wasn't in the packaging at all. No option for return but Amazon was able to issue a full refund same day. Mask is of sturdy material and looks great just sad it was broken.
1.0,Beautiful color. Very cute dress. Just the big hole makes it unwearable. Didn’t get to try on.  I will be returning.
1.0,"I have only had the belt for 6 weeks and it has already started breaking. The print is lifting from the belt itself. Of course, I am outside of the return window. Stuck with a broken belt."
1.0,Broke after a week and won't even wind up now
1.0,"This top took forever to get here. When it arrived I tried to lace it up. 3 of the loops came unstitched right away. If that wasn't bad enough, it was way too small. It wasn't even worth giving it away, I just threw it in the trash. Very disappointed"
1.0,"This is described as a set of two but when I received my packaging slip, it said qty 1. This should be corrected! Didn't fit as expected, a little small."
1.0,Scarf was described and shown as INFINITY but is not. Very disappointed as this was ordered as a gift.
1.0,It’s just like a rain coat not a puffer at all
1.0,"love it, but lose it with the car belt"
1.0,"This tie is a total piece of crap, will barely stay under shirt collar. 😡"
1.0,They were next to impossible to get on...will be sending them back.
1.0,Terrible quality. The problem poms on the bottom are barely attached and it’s very cheap looking.
1.0,"small in the body and large in the collar, the material of the worst quality clothing"
1.0,Turned my arm green.  Do not waste your money.
1.0,"The paracord was nicely put together, but the clip was broken when we received it and the Miami ""U"" logo was cheap and fell off the keychain in the packaging. Being a gift for my husband, this was disappointing."
1.0,Horrible quality in fabric... Isn't even worth $1.
1.0,Wore for only 8 hours and my daughters ears got infected. Yellow smelly puss from her piercing this is just unacceptable it should not cause this much issue in a short amount of time.
1.0,These are HUGE and look super tacky !! Definitely returning asap
1.0,"My other nightgown has been great so I ordered the floral pattern. It faded immediately after washing, it is scratching it in the material is heavy, not soft at all. I am checking to see if I can send it back otherwise I will be throwing it away."
1.0,"I liked the look of the bag. It worked well as a gym bag for about a month. After a month, the zipper broke off."
1.0,I'm a 40 bust line and they are beyond snuggle not comfy at all will be returning them
1.0,It was broke tarnished
1.0,It fits very weird did not like it at all
1.0,Don't waist your money. Cotton starts coming apart after 3 washes. Not a good product and you will be able only to use it at home since the material gets damages after 4 washes. Will not recommend this product to anybody.
1.0,Fell off within a day
1.0,This was kids sizes.
1.0,Thin and extremely cheap looking ! This was absolutely awful
1.0,Too small and see through. Not worth buying. Terrible material
1.0,I felt too scary for my taste
1.0,"Absolute horrible piece of mess i ever seen. My daughter was Cleopatra for her halloween party and after an hour of trying to detangle this poor excuse for a wig, we gave up. Do not buy! You will be so frustrated and disappointed."
1.0,I ordered this hat for my fasher for Father's Day but when I received the hat it was hideous! The picture doesn't show that the diamond plate part of the bill on the hat looks & feels like cheap plastic. Needless to say I did not give it to my father!!
1.0,I was shocked how large this necklace was.  I was looking for something small and delicate (like in the picture).  This necklace was heavy and huge.  I sent it back and chose something else.
1.0,Did not like fabric. Item cheaply constructed. Made in China.
1.0,"This is a size 5.5 Nike boys' shoe. I paid $68.00, expecting significant quality at that price. But these shoes could not AT ALL withstand the wear and tear of a 10 year old boy, lasting less than 30 days before a large hole formed in the toe. These were not even used as ""play"" sneakers. They were purchased as our new school shoes in mid-August and they were ONLY worn approximately 3 days per week as part of a school uniform from September 5 to September 30. We will absolutely be replacing them with a different brand, and will not be outfitting the kids in any more Nike sneakers for a while."
1.0,"This shirt was nothing like I was expecting based on the pictures and reviews. The front was way longer than the back making it look awkward, and the entire shirt was much longer than described. I cannot even wear this item. Very disappointed."
1.0,Hard to breath through
1.0,Broke the 2nd time it was worn!
1.0,Be careful with what you get.  They are not spelling it correctly.  It is a French word.<br /> ( Parku ) is the proper spelling.
1.0,"Fits too awkward and uncomfortable to explain.  Wish I could return this, but too late, the paint brushed off the gloves and feet immediately.  Make sure you wear spanx or a girdle.  0 rating."
1.0,I am returning the item due to poor quality. There are areas on the seams where the print is missing. White lines are visible on the seams and it looks very cheap.
1.0,Not like tho photo at all and way too small. Very disappointed. In the photo it looks as if you can where a normal bra but the neck like is cut so tight your bea straps will show.
1.0,Horrible and poor quality.  I guess I got what a paid for it. Bought it for my daughter. Did not even show it to her. I was embarrassed.
1.0,Piece of Chinese crap don't waste your money.
1.0,My key slips out of the keychain holder. Wasted $ on a key holder that my key falls out every time I go out! Sad it doesn’t work.
1.0,This item was see through and runs real small. You’ll need to size up two or three.<br />Disappointed
1.0,Lenses don’t stay in place.  They won’t lock in like my husband’s previous pair. They keep popping out.
1.0,Way too short & small... had to return
1.0,"These slippers fit well and are quite comfortable.  My only complaint is the the stitching is already coming apart, so I don't expect them to last long.  Oh, well.  For the price I'll consider them to be disposable.  You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Edit:  These slippers lasted about 10 months before disintegrating.  I only wore them around the house, so it wasn't like I was hard on them.  Even given the fact that I didn't have high expectations, I thought I'd get at least a year out them before they totally fell apart.  So I'm downgrading my rating to 1 star.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,Didn’t even worn these for a week before they were turning my ears colors and turned a black color...
1.0,It broke after 3 days I am going to return it. Cheapley made.
1.0,I wear xlg item felt like a med...tight fitting...very disappointed
1.0,the white part is literally see-through.<br /><br />just saran your body and call it a day.
1.0,Kids ages 6 thru 10 ! None of them liked it! Not snug! Will be sending back
1.0,"Incredibly small, wouldn’t be considered a plus size item if seen in person."
1.0,The design on the front is hard and plastic-y.  Not comfortable at all.  Sent back.
1.0,One shoe has quit lighting up.  We have only had the shoes one a half months. Bought this for a Christmas present. My little boy is sad.<br />I wrote the company but no response as of 1/25/17
1.0,Broke the first day! Ugh
1.0,Straps slip.
1.0,"The item is not as big as described, They are super small. There was no point in sending them back since they weren't expensive. I do not plan on ordering again."
1.0,pretty but it broke too quick! didnt last one week
1.0,"It is more like a wine pink than red and looks like I borrowed someone else’s bottoms, I hate their fur and the color even more"
1.0,Either no battery or dead battery on delivery.  So tires of getting stuff that doesn't work.
1.0,Nice looking but didn’t work for me
1.0,Too small. Also like a nylon material.
1.0,Does not fit properly. Such a disappointment
1.0,"After owning the perfect pair of 90 degree leggings from Reflex, it is so hard to find them.  I have done two different purchases and none of them have been the same material as the ones that I have been seeking.  I reached out to the company after the first purchase in hopes that they'd help me or comp me some money for my secone purchase, but they didn't care.  I returned this pair and will try to find them elsewhere."
1.0,The main zipper got jammed every time I would try and open it and ultimately ended up breaking within 24 hours of using it. Then the right side of the over shoulder strap started breaking off while wearing it. Horribly made wouldn’t recommend buying which is a shame bc it is really cute looking.
1.0,Way to small . Order one size to big cause thought it would fit and still didn't fit. Send it back
1.0,Fuzz got funny after first wash and bits of fizz get everywhere . Material is rough feels dry rot
1.0,I only got to wear these once because they broke!
1.0,Shoes began to fall apart (rubber coming apart from cloth) in about 3 weeks of use.  Waste of money for kiddo shoes.  Poor quality.  Keep on shopping.
1.0,My daughter won't wear them because the seam is on her toes and hurts when she puts her shoes on..ugh! What a waste of $.
1.0,Fit is very loose. Feels like the elastic is too weak. I would not buy again.
1.0,"Will be sending these back 4 a Full Refund, sent damaged sunglasses Bent Frame..Sometimes u get what u Pay For."
1.0,"Wore it 1 time and ripped right up the side. Cheaply made. I worried about that when I saw it, should have returned it."
1.0,Broke on the second use
1.0,"I returned this shirt.  It was very tight and the material was uncomfortable, not soft at all."
1.0,It broke shortly after gifting it!
1.0,This is an underwire! Nothing in the description mentions underwire. Underwires do not bring support—they damage tissue.
1.0,They are not round or blue. Kinda a blueish see through.  Just avoid and call it good.
1.0,material is uncomfortable and the shirt is complicated and confusing to put on ... will not recommend I cant get a refund so waste of money... gonna go burn the item thank you.
1.0,Ripped on the first used
1.0,This belt has only been used a few times since we bought it and it some of the elastic  webbing has broken loose from the tip of it.  I bought is for my dad and he did like that it was easy to fasten but unfortunately the quality is not good so I cannot recommend
1.0,"the toe loop pulled out in less than 6 weeks... love the look, the feel, but only lasting 6 weeks?"
1.0,Rhodium plating wore off within days
1.0,Very difficult to put on watch. Would not stay on watch. Actually didn't fit my Versa 3. Returned it.  Was disappointed because I loved the design on the band.
1.0,I'm late in posting this review but just... no. This looks like it was made for a child. Had to return.
1.0,After only a few uses the coating is peeling off making them unusable as you can not see out of them. Would not recommend these.
1.0,This was cheaply made. Had glitter glued onto the stone. I don’t recommend I gave it away to a kid to use as play jewelry
1.0,full of strings on the inside.  Hard to get feet into without snagging a toe or toenail!
1.0,"Accidents happen, but disappointed to open my package with a brown stain. Kinda gross. Tracking info wasn’t accurate or up to date. Not sure that’s the seller issue or not but felt shady. Cute enough top. Material is nice. Quality mediocre but its a boho vibe so it works."
1.0,"It is a cute set and our daughter loved it at first.  After only 1 week of use all the pins fell off, the backpack began coming apart at the seam, and is literally falling apart.  The stitching quality is that of a child.  I do not recommend buying this for use of any kind."
1.0,Hot material and small
1.0,Not at all what the picture looked like. Thought I was getting a batwing sweater dress. Material is so thin you can see through it and it's not batwing as much as just a bigger neckline. I wouldn't waste my money if I was you. Wish this had been reviewed before my purchase.
1.0,These suck! I'm just over 6'2 and wear these when I work (Dept. of Corrections). These pop off the shirt constantly. I have adjusted them to give me the maximum length and I have also tried adding more material for it to grip on by folding or rolling of my shirt for it to grip on but it will just slide off within 30 minutes. The strap material is of high quality though and looks like it would last awhile.
1.0,Shoes are way too big and are not true to size.
1.0,"Ordered Nov 20th, its now Christmas EVE and guess what NO NECKLASS, had to go out and buy new ones, keep my $$$ and my necklass!!!"
1.0,I was very happy with my green one I received but my white one looks like it was cut on the bottom like across with scissors if it wasn’t for that I’d give these shirts a higher rating!
1.0,"I sized up & that still didn’t help. It’s super hard to put on & when I tried to take it off it broke. I know the stone isn’t real, but this looked so fake & almost grey."
1.0,My husband could not get these on the right part of his nose to be able to focus his eyes through the lenses. They did NOT work for him.  He doesn’t have a particularly big nose or face so I’m not sure why exactly the fit didn’t work but it was not good.
1.0,Top was huge and bottoms were so small. It’d be nice to be able to buy as separate pieces
1.0,"Ugly, cheap looking.  Would not wear this at all.  And if I send it back, shipping and handling are going to cost more than what this thing is worth."
1.0,Absolutely not good material cheap feel to it and not comfortable to wear at all. Not flattering on and it’s going back
1.0,"Compra L pero es demasiado pequeña, no me gustó!"
1.0,It's as if they put a size A cup on a size 3xl bikini. Cups are hard and too small but Also no support even with the ability to tie the middle for some reason.  I like the design and idea the bottoms fit fine. But no possible way to wear the top -_-
1.0,This are perfect and beautiful and glorious and much needed in my life but they are UNWEARABLE. when I put them on I cried one million tears of sorrow because the top cushiony part where you insert your toe is unbearable in pain. It hurts and makes it impossible to walk in. This is a design flaw. I don't think this is something you can break in. Unless you want to break your bruise your akelyes tendon. Go with Glob. This is not mathematical enough for me.
1.0,The earring is beautiful but fell apart after I wear it the second time
1.0,Says XL more like a small
1.0,Not as nice as expected. Wasn’t centered.
1.0,The outfit fits perfect but material all bad..the print is way off..basically looks like a 80's kids halloween costume..I wasted my money on this one.
1.0,"This product is WAY too small. I read the reviews and thought it wouldn't affect me because my hair is really fine, but I could barely fit the thing on my head.  My sister asked me if it was for a child.  Do not buy this item."
1.0,"waist and everything fits good, but no ball room."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY ! I got this watch 3 weeks ago and it is not worth it at all. The golden went off in 2 weeks and the third week the black piece around came off the watch. I really liked at first but personally, it  was the worst watch I  have ever bought it has the quality of a 25 dollar watch. I tried to treat it good but it was impossible Keep your money and get a good one because you cant even return it."
1.0,Severly disappointed. My daughter is an average slim 8 year old. We ordered the size 9-10 for her and it was so small she couldn't even cross her arms in front of her chest. She was so excited to get it today.
1.0,Arrived folded three times in a tiny package. The folds will not come out. Part of the flower is not finished. Disappointed.
1.0,Waistline was very small for the size . And the length was very short  .
1.0,I bought this for me and I wear a large in just about everything. I do have to sometimes go with XL because of my shoulders but this shouldn't make a difference with stretchy stuff. The arms run small. Made for someone more like 5 feet tall rather than 5 '11. I've run into this problem before when buying stuff online that is clearly coming from Asian factories. I think this item is meant for a certain body type that is the opposite of a typical Northern or Southern American or European. Keep that in mind when buying this product. I hadn't anticipated that it would be high quality for the price but the zipper is very poorly made and the fabric is very thin. I ended up giving this to my 5 foot 3 daughter and it fits her (keep in mind I ordered a large which I think shouldn't fit a petite girl).
1.0,This is not a heavy weight shoe horn.
1.0,Items was not what I expected at all.  Very cheaply made and thinner than expected.
1.0,"Not as pictured- very thinly made.  I was disappointed that it did not look as it is pictured above, bummer!"
1.0,I ordered an XL when I received it the sweater would fit my 12 year old niece that wears a medium.  However when I tried to return it I was given my money back right away.
1.0,"Very disappointed! This is made identical to a slip...Not a shirt, tank top, or camisole. Doesn't look ANYTHING like the picture. Very ugly & a waste of money!!!"
1.0,Love it I have it in gold too unfortunately it broke already
1.0,Arrived broken. Belle emblem was broken off. Arrived bent
1.0,"la camisa era slim fit , y no estaba detallado en la descripcion"
1.0,I just started using this bag and the zipper broke already.  I wish I didn’t purchase this product.
1.0,"As soon as I placed dollar bills in the money clip, the top 2 screws tore out of the carbon fiber and aluminum. Junk."
1.0,I returned this order the next day - it must have been defective... didn't fit at all
1.0,The studs are actually really big so they look very silly to wear.
1.0,UPDATE... I returned the first one and ordered a new one. I got a single adjustable one again. I will not be ordering a third.<br /><br />I received a single adjustable buckle that did require you to sew it.
1.0,Waaaay too small. And too thin tore through like a paper sack. Rough material.
1.0,I Like the short is what I expected but order is incorrect I ordered twice and I keep getting Medium instead of Large.
1.0,The bow broke the first time wearing it.
1.0,"Ok, but not roomy or slouchy enough"
1.0,Would not recommend these to anyone. Very cheap looking
1.0,Cheap Cut and Cheap Material
1.0,Terrible fabric and not at all flattering. I sent this back.
1.0,The top is good to wear and fits but the pants are thin and see-through you could read what my underwear said.
1.0,Flimsy insole.  Not at all what I was expecting.  I have flat feet and this aided in no way what so ever.
1.0,"Normally I wear a size large, but just to be on the safe side, I ordered an XL, but it was still small and the material is not good quality."
1.0,I had bought a 2X size before.  This time a worker placed the 2x size in a large sized top.  Then had it shipped to me.  I gave it to my neice and I just didn't bother to send it back.
1.0,Too big for me. I tried to fix it and came apart.
1.0,like this swimsuit but the left side shoulder cut was not even returned or exchange
1.0,"Oh my, where to begin??? So cute in theory and yet too poorly constructed of rather tent like material that I just have to send them back. I'm 5'7"", 135 lbs., slim legs and the medium is gaping at the mid-rise waste while stitched a bit too snug in the calf area to not bunch up and feel annoying to wear for me. I say ""tent like material"" because  the canvas a tent is made out of or the covers on my golf clubs are what the outer layer of these pants feel like. Not what I was looking for."
1.0,There is no way this bra is the size requested or the size shown on the tags.
1.0,"I purchased this for my wife who has very small hands but they wouldn't fit her. All of the fingers were about the same size, my wife could not wear them. A very small child might be able to use these with supervision.<br />I cannot recommend these."
1.0,not what ad shows
1.0,Cheaply made wore once and stitching was showing. These are baggy on my 11 year so it’s not so to being to tight!!
1.0,Smaller than expected and tarnished quickly. It’s not sterling silver.
1.0,Ziro quality
1.0,Love the shape but it was smaller than I anticipated.  And I broke one easily
1.0,This band was received and the color was highlighter bright orange I ended up throwing it away. Waste of money don’t buy
1.0,It was too small for my 8 & 10year old. The description should’ve included an age range.<br />😠🙄
1.0,Cute but turned black after the first wear.
1.0,I posted in the past that this is a great fit for small wrists like mine.  Today at work the link just fell off while I was teaching my class. The link just fell off and broke. I have only worn it about 8-9 times since i purchased it.
1.0,Terrible quality and I regret purchasing them so much. I've had them a couple weeks but only just put one in. After 3 whole days my skin is turning GREEN and the design broke already. Absolutely garbage do not buy
1.0,Bought this for my son.  The LED light didn't work from the beginning.
1.0,This necklace is extremely disappointing.There is no adjuster and no way to get it around your neck.
1.0,Can not wear these....so disappointed.  The wire is too thick to go through the hole in my ear.
1.0,This product arrived torn... the glove had a hole in it. Please stay away its over priced and trashy.
1.0,Damaged product received.
1.0,very nice design and good quality but i ordered an XL but the size which came was too small. when checking the size of the shirt i released the tag at the back of the shirt was cut out. so i am left to assume i was sent a medium or a large instead of an XL. dishonest
1.0,"I was super disappointed only because I got the wrong item. I ordered the dress in orange and it came in black and white polka dots. The dress that came was good quality, which made me even more sad that it was the wrong one! Since it is third party, returns seem to take a couple of weeks at least and I was hoping to have this for an upcoming trip. Hopefully the next person has better luck."
1.0,Very cheap quality. I was able to put them on my face but they barely fit & they just looked weird. I feel like they are for children Parties for gift bags. Other then that I wouldn’t recommend buying for adults.
1.0,Broke...wasn't connected..  looked like a necklace
1.0,"It is a pretty bag and had a black one with the same design before. That one lasted a long time, but this grey one, the zip separated after the first use.  I only put my phone and a small credit card wallet inside.  too bad I waited so long to use it to find the zipper was broken."
1.0,"So, these look great... BUT, They don't shrink back fast enough and they fall off ur wrist"
1.0,It is too hard to get it on the ear.
1.0,I bought this for infant and it's way to big don't adjust any smaller to much of a hassle to send back so had to find a baby one.
1.0,It is so bad. Definetely not as expected! It sucked! The material is plastic definitely not leather as on the description.
1.0,"Pretty upset about this purchase. I received these earrings on January 5th. I bought them because they were a reasonable price for 14K gold plated earrings and described them to not tarnish. I saw other reviews backing that up, so I went for it. After wearing for a few weeks I noticed they had turned a bronze color and took them out to see they were even worse than I thought. I loved the style and feel of these earrings the first week of purchase but am pretty upset at what has happened with them."
1.0,This is a waste of money. After 2 wears the colour changes.
1.0,I had a hole under my arms after two wears. Not too happy about that and wish could return it
1.0,"Not what was advertised. The picture is nothing like the product. No return is available, so can't get money back."
1.0,"Terrible dress it’s not cotton and doesn’t look like the picture AT ALL! It’s a shiny fabric, like pajamas would be and it’s exactly what this dress looks like!"
1.0,The ring does not look like the picture.<br />The ring looks like it came out of a gum ball machine.😩
1.0,it's not what picture shows because it's like a sticker behind glass front doesn't look anything like they they show on website
1.0,Grandma disliked it and easily broke
1.0,Not the greatest.
1.0,The dress did not fit at all.
1.0,"The zippers broke within 24 hours, don’t bother buying this product. We ended up replacing it while traveling."
1.0,I only received the top! No bottoms!!!!!
1.0,Horrible very very small never again
1.0,It tarnished very quick
1.0,"I bought this bag and carried it 5 times max.  I did not overload it.  I really like it because of the lightweight material and all the zips/pockets.  Today, when I carried it I looked down and one side of the strap was pulled out from the inside and was ready to break off!  So, I spent the rest of the day having to hold the purse!  Thank goodness I purchased it at a discount retailer for half of the price here, but I'm still MAD.  Cheap Cheap."
1.0,The face photo is giant. I was hoping it would be closer to the size of a human face. It is not. The mouth goes ear to ear.
1.0,"Returns aren't free on this item, so if it doesn't fit you are screwed."
1.0,These shirts are extremely cute! However the size does not run true to size I typically wear a size Large and I believe I may need an XL or XXL.  Not sure if I will reorder.
1.0,"El color negro lo perdio en la primera lavada.  Se descose Facilmente sin utilizar donde se descosio..<br />Los bolsillos de atras se salen por no estar bien cosido. NO es de buena calidad, para el dinero que se paga!"
1.0,this was very cheaply made. see through fabric. no good.... sent it back
1.0,This not hypoallergenic.  This turned after 24 hours
1.0,Not happy with the order... was there too be two or is it just one...??..
1.0,Its way to large. I bought a 3-6 and it’s the size of 9-12 onesie....<br />and the red is not red. It’s a dark like burgundy. Even my picture doesn’t show it’s true color.
1.0,"Bought it even though I saw the reviews about too small, since the seller’s “Jewelry Information” said next to “Resizable - Yes”. It is not. Moving the slide just opens the loops enough to slip over the stone, but the size itself DOES NOT change. It is 6.18” period. Like the other reviewer, I do not know any adult females with size 6” wrist, except my 5’1” friend who is tinier than a 13 year old girl.  This bracelet is clearly a miss by Uno de 50. Too bad :( I loved the stone, but must send it back."
1.0,"Liked the softness and fit, but zipper broke less than three weeks after receiving."
1.0,They look nice but used them skiing once and they were tore up and could no longer be use again. The material is not very sturdy
1.0,Firstly these shoes run a size small secondly they are horribly made. They it only smell like factory glue and chemicals but I can SEE the glue. The material is made of of dollar store crap. I got a full refund but they said to keep the boots because it cost more to return. DO NOT BUY EWWWW
1.0,Seems like cheap material
1.0,The first time i use it for my baby broke
1.0,"The dress was not sowen very well. The waistline was off. The top did not fit appropriately at all. The bottom was sheer and loks like picture.  But for overall fit, it it did not live up to the model representing look."
1.0,It is not a warm housecoat.  The material is cheap.  I was expecting something from amazon.
1.0,"Super cheap looking, plastic, don't waste your money"
1.0,"Terrible shirt, usually wear a medium. Got the largest size available and it was still to small. Fabric is very thin, gave it to my brothers girlfriend​, she's is a size 00 fit her great, but she only wore it twice and it already has holes in it. Also shipping took forever nearly 2 months"
1.0,"Was looking forward to this, however, shirt arrived musty, damp and filled with mold. No thank you!"
1.0,"I'm very dissatisfied. I ordered the dress 9 days ago and it has yet to come in and it appears the item has been lost in transit. At this point, I just want my dress! I have a dance coming up soon and it appears I'll be having to go out and buy another dress (not online; there is no time to do that now that I've been waiting this long for something that said it would come a certain time but didn't). I know that Amazon will refund my money but I just want the dress."
1.0,"The ring is perfectly round, not horseshoe shaped like in the image. It's silver. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE IN THE PACKAGE. fake septum ring and fake product."
1.0,The knot was sewed and the color is not what was pictured.
1.0,One of my shoe doesn't light up from the second day I bought it!
1.0,Horrible size chart i order diff sizes and all were smaller than size chart
1.0,Poor construction plus we couldn't even get it to give half a spin.
1.0,The print on this is nothing like the picture.  The grey dinosaurs are purple.  The black is a faded black color.  Not worth the price
1.0,"Zip is not symmetrical, not straight, it curves instead. Sometimes you get acceptable items for a low price, but not in this case."
1.0,They fogged up
1.0,Loved the picture and the fabric. But unfortunately at the wedding that my daughters and I attend - all 3 of us had something pull apart from the dress. Thank goodness I had a navy bra; cause the front strap fell forward and I exposed my bra! So to endure the remainder of the wedding - I knotted the strap to the back of my bra! Aaaahhh!<br />But it was a pretty dress!!
1.0,I bought three pair of the same size and none of them fit the same.
1.0,First one came broken.  Second one broken after a month. Cheaply made 👎🏻
1.0,la tela fea
1.0,"Don’t waste your money on this. Bought as a birthday gift from my son but the middle section came apart on first wearing. Tried to fix several times but keeps unraveling. Garbage product, do not buy."
1.0,"I ordered the distressed brown leather pants, size 46 waist. What I recieved was brown leather pants, size 40 waist. I still wanted the pants. Demon Wears said they will send me the proper size, that had been almost two months now. When I inquired about the order, they said they were dispatched. I inquired about a tracking or shipping number, but I was told the order was dispatced. I did not want a refund, but I wanted the brown leather pants in the proper size (46)."
1.0,It broke the first day my daughter wear it :( And I've now past the Amazon return by date.
1.0,This looks like a baggy shirt.  The Xlarge could fit a 10 year old.
1.0,"FALSE ADVERTISING - Item not at all as pictured. Very cheap, somewhat scratchy material. I cannot believe Amazon is letting this seller get away with such high stars reviews especially where false advertising is involved. Do not recommend!"
1.0,Love the look and the feel but i womt buy another its a little thight to put on for it being a loose fiting shirt
1.0,"Very poor quality, runs big."
1.0,The product was cheaply made. The material was different than I expected. It was more of a thin polyester. It was also very thin which wouldn’t keep anyone warm during the winter.  Returning it today.
1.0,"Very pretty, but seemed like it was plastic and would be hot returned it"
1.0,These are awful. Not nearly as thin and light as the eBags version.  These are canvas. You absolutely get what you pay for!
1.0,The back heating settings is stop working of this heated vest. The adjust button is not very user friendly. Very poor qualit.
1.0,very lightweight not good quality at all
1.0,"I was looking forward to getting this item. Shipping took forever.<br />When I got it, I was very disappointed to say the least. The pendant and necklace look nowhere near like in the pictures. They look cheap and poorly made<br />I’m embarrassed to even wear it.<br />Bottom Line: Don’t buy this item. It is not worth the price, not even close."
1.0,"Most rubbish t shirt, extremely small for an adult like. The large size looks like my 6years old size, do not waste your money for it. I just do not want the headache to stand in a long line at the post office to mail it. I hate the drama to get my money from Amazon,  so I decided to trash it in the dustbin."
1.0,The design/ picture is completely faded. I didn’t even wash it yet and the picture is almost gone. Waste of money. Don’t buy!!!
1.0,TRANSPARENT!!! DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO SHOW YOUR UNDERWEAR!!
1.0,The dragon was embroidered on the wrong side of the beanie so can’t wear with dragon showing properly
1.0,No le gustan
1.0,Says one size. Tag says medium. Does not look or fit at all like pictures. Nothing oversized or flowing about it. Will be returning and never ordering from them again. Awful.
1.0,Thisbhat was way to small and very cheaply made.
1.0,Extremely thin material. Even the pockets are thinly made. I bought these to wear as pajamas around the house. I wouldn’t suggest to get if you’re looking for something warm and cozy. There’s still space to move freely in them but that’s it. I don’t think theses pants will last longer than a couple months. Especially of you’re on the bigger side.
1.0,got as a gift on my wishlist can't figure out how to return to get the bigger size...
1.0,I love the red jewels and the shiny black metal material this spider necklace and earrings are made of but how am i suppose to repair a damaged item? Fuse metal ? Really I ordered this set just for the spider necklace and it arrived broken! They should really consider packaging fragile items more carefully or check the item before sending it to the customer ! Very disappointed!
1.0,I'm sure they're good but I was sent the wrong size and gave them to my niece. Seller's mistake.
1.0,This jean is cut very strangely. It fits at waist but the crotch is baggy. Quality is poor.
1.0,These pants do not fit to size
1.0,"They come with thick bumpy padding that thankfully can be removed because it does not make your breast look like they are any kind of natural shape and mine are fairly perky and well rounded to begin with so pads are not needed. The real issue is that the fabric doesn’t cling, and when exercising the bottom rolls up to under your breasts especially doing any kind of ab workout. If you’re only standing up/running or walking while wearing them then they could be ok but the fabric is also scratchy. Not a great find in my opinion."
1.0,I returned it as it was way to small for me both width and length. The waist was ridiculously tight.
1.0,These are not the earrings on the picture. And they are very big. Not impressed
1.0,Didn’t give any lift
1.0,"I will not ever purchase this boot ever again they are not water proof, when they get wet so does my socks also they spreads so wide because they are cheap rubber. they do not stay fitted and my feet are narrow. not again"
1.0,Several nails were misshaped at the tip. & nails bent when I tried to hammer in.
1.0,Loved this necklace the first two times i wore it.. after having it for a week it has already tarnished and turned brown.
1.0,"Poor quality, earing had a missing pearl, pearls are of poor quality, dissatisfied with the products"
1.0,6 pairs look fine but one pair was damaged. seems poorly packaged as well
1.0,Back of one earring was broken off.  Bought as a gift so I did not see it until after I wrapped it and it was opened.  Very embarrassing an could not return since I shopped early for present and 30 days had expired when I saw it was broken.
1.0,The hat didn’t fit the description which I’m upset about. I wanted this very hat because it stated it had a total of 4 buttons on it.  It came with one on each side instead of 2. I’m not much on sending things because I really don’t have time to mess with it. I understand mistakes happen but at the same time I like to have what I ordered.
1.0,The first time we cranked opened the umbrella it ripped a little bit on the top. Then after about four uses the entire umbrella broke in half. Pieces snapped off as my husband was cranking it open and it caused his hand to get cut up and bleed.<br />It was a beautiful umbrella but definitely not sturdy or made to last.
1.0,The watch I recieved did not work and appears to have something inside the face (moisture??).
1.0,I had to return this because the fit was completely wrong for me. The top was huge while the bottom was okay.
1.0,Not a durable product. Easily bendable.
1.0,Original watch and replacement both defective. They both would pause telling/advancing time in sunlight. In the shade/indoors they were great. Nice band too.
1.0,"Poorly made, inaccurate sizing and poor quality fabric"
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE!! No RETURNS AND RUN VERY SMALL!!<br /><br />First of all the LARGE was extremely small in the waist legs and shoulders!<br /><br />Secondly, when you buy it it appears there’s a return policy with Amazon till the end of January. THAT IS NOT THE CASE!! After you get it and it doesn’t fit when you hit return it says NO RETURNS!!!"
1.0,Item is a poor fit
1.0,"These were cute, but the stud was WAY to big. after a while i noticed when i took it out, the small magnet wasnt in my nose, but it was. they got stuck in my nose and then one time i put one in and heard the magnets click together and i shined a light in my nose and there was 15 magnets! i got them out, get it was very disturbing."
1.0,"This product was waaayyyyy too big in the chest, and waaaayyyy too small in the hip/thigh area. Returning promptly."
1.0,Worst leggings ever... too short and busted in multiple places within 1 hour of wearing them.
1.0,Not what I thought I was getting. Ordered by size chart and came out too big and too see through.
1.0,"I’d give no stars if possible. Less than 3 months in my wallet. With half the windows empty and my wallet is a 6 pocket hipster. The back page that is hardened plastic split and broke along the seam. The older inserts Ive had, have had the backing page soften up and not stay properly inserted. But never a catastrophic failure in so short a time frame. Don’t waste your money"
1.0,"If I could post a picture of how these looked on I would, but it wouldn’t be appropriate. They were so oversized and awkward on my nipples that I can’t wear them at all they looked absolutely terrible."
1.0,"Unless you are an extremely small, petite person. This will NOT fit you."
1.0,These developed (or revealed?) a hole in the side as soon as they were worn.
1.0,"After 2 washes started tearing, quality is not what I’ve expected."
1.0,What a piece of caca.  It broke in half. I was so happy to get it but now it is in the garbage
1.0,Strap arrived broken.
1.0,This shirt was not flattering at all
1.0,My son had these shoes for 4 months and they completely fell apart. I'm done buying shoes off of Amazon.
1.0,The product isn’t at all what it looks in the picture. It’s a cotton65% poly35% blend but almost like a thicker version of wet/dry material.
1.0,I thought I was buying the 44 mm turns out I bought the 40 mm so it don’t fit right. Very disappointed
1.0,"The first time I ordered one of these dresses in navy, it was amazing.  The material on the body was thick and has a great hang.  There was a lining under the lace.  This was a few years ago.  The latest one is a cheap material on the body, has no stiffness or proper hang and is totally missing the underlining on the bodice.  Not even close to the same dress but being advertised as exactly the same.  It's so sad because I really, really want another dress just like the first one.  Bummer.  I hate it when companies do this."
1.0,cheap tarp not a dress
1.0,Quality is not good and sent the wrong color.
1.0,I bought the small size So different to the photo!
1.0,The pentagram is hardly visible at all and the size of the hat is rather small. It's a one size firs most but only if most means 12 year old girl. Overall I feel like I wasted my money.
1.0,"Shipping was very quick.  Ordered a medium.  Fit ok.  I am 5'4"" 140lbs.  I didn't feel any tummy control.  The leggings were too short for me.  Could have been 3 inches longer.  Returned.  The return process was so easy."
1.0,Weird....
1.0,Real bad product. They don’t fit snug. I won’t buy this brand.
1.0,They look great if you are around 85 years old
1.0,I bought the gray version of this wallet by Taxi Wallet and I love it but I've had it about a year and it's starting to look warn out so I figured I'd try the pink version and that it would be the same. It's not. It's smaller and won't hold all my cards. This one is Taxi Wallet by Owl and the gray one is Taxi Wallet by Taxi Wallet.  I'll prb just gift it to someone that has less cards than I do.
1.0,2 small of a fit
1.0,"Very bad quality, definitely not squat proof. Tore at the seam between the legs in first wear. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"These were super cute, but made with very cheap material and see through. As well as they ripped the very first time wearing them.  They were even big on me, but clearly not made well.😞"
1.0,too small for a well rounded face
1.0,My husband had these for 2 weeks and probably wore them less than 2 hours a day and the sole of the slipper just peeled off as he was walking.
1.0,The color is beautiful but it looks really cheap in person. The straps don’t match with the quality of the backpack. They should have been made with the same material. I thought it was going to break.
1.0,"These were my favorite pair of pants...for the whole 18 hours i got to wear them, before they got a big hole right in the crotch. Really wanted to love these more :((("
1.0,"Had to return the coat as it was too big for me, not because of quality.  I usually take a 1x or 2x, but the 2x was way too big for me."
1.0,"The genuine sheepskin leather gloves arrived today.  On trying on the first glove the ""leather"" ripped!!  I didn't even bother with the second glove.  I would NOT recommend these gloves!!"
1.0,sharp edges on buckle
1.0,"See through, very thin, extremely poor quality"
1.0,"I LOVED THE DESIGN, HOWEVER, I THOUGHT THE SIZE OF EARRINGS WOULD BE LARGER.  VERY DISAPPOINTING."
1.0,"Purchased in July, it's now Octoberf, it's already about to split between 2 holes. Very poor material."
1.0,It is not wide and it kept rolling up. Horrible product.
1.0,Very large size even when bought by size chart.
1.0,"So disappointed in this dress! Looks so cute in the stock photo, but in real life, the fabric is flimsy and thin. It feels like it would disintegrate after one wash. Also, the fabric content listed was cotton, polyester, spandex. There is absolutely no cotton in this dress (see photo of tag). I ordered the orange color, which is closer to pink. Oh and the dress came flawed, with a black mark on the shoulder."
1.0,"I ordered these pants for my daughter for Christmas.  After one wash the pants are coming apart at the seams. I sent them back for replacement and a week after having them, these pants are now coming apart at the seams. They are very cute, but very cheaply made."
1.0,The shirt I received is completely different than shown. It’s advertised as a cotton blend and I received a very obvious spandex shirt. Not the look I like or want. It looks like an under armor workout top for men. Very disappointed.
1.0,"There are really large red and white roses painted on these which do not show in the photo. They would be much, much better without them."
1.0,"This hat came after a long wait which was ok. But when I pulled it out of the bag. I was disgusted at what i saw.  The decal is not and decal but a piece of fabric sewn on on to sides not all four.  The design you cant even make it out.  It was supposed to be a dachshund, all you can see is the little brown paws and the rest just looks like black ribbon.  So disappointed!"
1.0,"I tried to return the shorts as they say they were a 34 ,but in reality, they fit like a 28. Their size chart is completely off. Then their customer service to return it was so hard and difficult, that i ended up just eating the cost of the shorts and I won't buy from this company again r"
1.0,Total crap. Very low quality and falling apart.
1.0,I ordered a women’s medium and this is a picture of it on my 3 year old daughter.... fits almost perfect on her. I read that it fit a little small that’s why I ordered a medium. I normally wear a small.
1.0,I bought this for my boyfriend because he didn't like the original band with all the holes.  He has an active job and this band broke in about a month.  Might be ok for someone with a desk job but it didn't hold up for him.
1.0,"Poor quality , ran small ,not as expected ."
1.0,"I returned this dress because u had ordered 2 for my granddaughters for Christmas pics, however when they came one was entirely Wrong....floor length with an elastic waist.  The other dress was huge even though it was supposed to be a small....I returned them both, then....I get sent another one!  Now, I have to return this one too.  The armholes are way too large for a size small and the material is  paper thin"
1.0,Product came broken. I am highly upset
1.0,I tend to be a large in most clothes and sometimes get XL for loose fit. I got these in a large and I'm not even kidding they looked like an XS. Did not fit in the slightest bit.
1.0,"After two days on the river they where ripped off completely.<br />Look nice,<br />Confortable,<br />But completely disposable after a few wears"
1.0,"TO small,"
1.0,"As many of the reviews state, beware the magnet wipes your credit card strips.  It took me awhile to figure it out because the chip is not effected but retailers that still use the strip my card no longer works.  It didn't effect all cards, just 2 that I kept closest to the magnet."
1.0,"perhaps my light green bag is too old, but did not clean as I needed-- at all."
1.0,Firstly I was disappointed to see that the tag was cut off. There is a black piece that seems as through someone cut it off. I did not like that. I ordered an XS & I don’t even know the size on it because the tag is gone. This is not an XS. It is falling off of me & almost reaching my knees.  Very disappointed. Quality of fabric doesn’t feel very nice either.
1.0,I bought this for my daughter and its really thin and its not even close to a sweat shirt
1.0,"Very cheap, waste of money"
1.0,"Delivered Jan 21 and on Jan 31 it just broke, fell off my wrist and scratched my watch face. I am not pleased..."
1.0,Quality was not what was represented by picture and written description. Size was grossly misrepresented.
1.0,"All of the broke with in one week of getting them, don't waste your money"
1.0,Shoddy bag that will soon be replaced.  The shoulder strap broke off at one of the attachment points within a month of purchase.
1.0,Size was wayyyyyy to small
1.0,This dress is Paper thin. I bought a large and it fits like a small. I wear a DDD and this dress couldn't get past my boots. Definitely will be returning.
1.0,this wasn't the size it said it was.
1.0,"I know these were only 10 bucks but when they say oversized, you think it would be a little bigger. These glasses were made from a cheap material. They are glossy, not flat color like they were supposed to be. Got them wet and the paint started to fade. They are very narrow and the arms are really short. Presses right on my temple. I tried actual oakley holbrooks and they were even shaped different. Just save up and get the real thing."
1.0,Too large bigger than what I expected
1.0,Size chart incorrect for shorts fitting as in pic (snug enough to roll up legs and fit snug. And i dont have skinny legs.
1.0,very loose and not wearable after the first wash
1.0,me están cobrando el pago nuevamente según no ha sido depositado pero en mi cuenta bancaria si sale que si
1.0,"Does horn headband does not fit adults let alone any child, it’s made for toddlers."
1.0,I returned the item for a replacement which was even worse. Sending both back.
1.0,I ordered the grey one and received the striped one instead. I also ordered a small and the package it came in says XXL. Doesn't matter though because the shirt fits weird anyway. It's way wide and short. Also the material is more 'tent' like and not comfy at all. Doesn't even seem like a real shirt. Waste of money (good thing it was so cheap!)
1.0,One of the earrings was broken and missing the part that goes through your ear.
1.0,Did not like how this material was when I got it.  Definitely looks more like a clown suit.  Going to try and save it by dyeing it but not holding my breath
1.0,Bag is not the same as described or as shown in the picture. The bag is also much smaller. Very disappointed.
1.0,Lasted just over a week and the adapter that snaps into the watch broke in half. I see no way to contact the seller  to attempt to get a replacement.<br /><br />*EDIT* Seller contacted me and sent a replacement. It lasted about 2 weeks and broke exactly the same way. This band looks nice but they are junk.
1.0,The sizing was way off.
1.0,gold chipped after 5 minutes and the molding bars were dirty
1.0,Worst boob job I have ever seen. Please take this off my feed
1.0,"There are not enough beads to go around my wrist. The straps are fine, just the amount of beading. I can't even wear it because of how it looks on my wrist. Very disappointing since we've ordered several bracelets and this is the only one with short bead length."
1.0,"cheap as hell! I cant believe I payed over 10 dollars for this plastic toy-watch. I think its meant for kids, not adults. What a waste of money. Shouldve only payed 3 dollars total! Rating given is negative one!"
1.0,Did like material feels really cheap. Head opening is very small
1.0,"Please be aware that this is a high waist skirt. Although the picture looks like it has a wide waist it does not. The waist is very small. Other than the cut of this skirt, the quality is fine.<br />Unfortunately, I missed my return window as I received this in the middle of a move and the box simply got buried amongst my moving boxes."
1.0,Chain came broke beads went everywhere???
1.0,Cheaply made and tooooo small - the material is NOT going to “break any wind” RETURNED!
1.0,The Picture makes the Dress look amazing on line.  The dress in person is not what I expected.
1.0,"Big and awkward shaped, not cute at all like in the picture"
1.0,I don’t know if I was sent the wrong item or what. But this is not at all as shown. It is more of a T-shirt than a sweater and the gray is a different color
1.0,It’s just a cheap plastic box. Costumer service nightmare. Don’t buy
1.0,so I initially ordered a medium based on the size chart. returned it for a large. no difference.<br />the fabric is super annoying.
1.0,My granddaughter flipped when she saw this purse when I gave it to her with a dress to match...but I found out the zipper broke the first week. 🤦🏻‍♀️☹️
1.0,"The earrings I received are nothing like the earrings I ordered - first off, the earrings I ordered were silver tone; the ones I received are gold tone. The colors are completely different from what I ordered - those I ordered included a really cute orange and blue pair; the earrings I received were mainly a drab olive color (except for one pair of CZ). I was so so disappointed, as there were a lot of good reviews."
1.0,Returning because length loo long.
1.0,Not as pictured......fights like a 90's thong.
1.0,"After using twice they don’t stick, Just buy the ones from Steinmart for $24 they last at least 15 uses!"
1.0,"Way too small,  I went by the size chart and got the size I needed and it still couldn’t fit comfortably"
1.0,"Shoddily made, fell apart quickly.  The stitching did not hold up, the tension in the clasps would not hold.  Simply did not do the job."
1.0,Just received it. Main zipper does not work. Returning it asap.
1.0,The shoe was too small  I would have liked it in the next size up 3 but I could not locate product to do so<br />Price was fair.  Look was just what the school wanted for a school uniform
1.0,I liked the design & thought the price would be worth it but they weren't. If they were durable these would be great.
1.0,Too small  I order xl  fits medium
1.0,"Poorly made.  Stitching was off and white thread was hanging out of a seam.  I really did like this, the color was perfect amd fit well but I returned it."
1.0,Disappointed! Got this shirt for a friend and she noticed a stain. She turned it inside out and noticed there was a misprint on the inside of the shirt.
1.0,We received this costume set in the mail today and it came only with the hat and the blue jacket. The gloves were not included with our purchase. This is very disappointing!
1.0,"Nice, but too small... ordered an extra large-fits like a medium.  Love the style, but hate the fit."
1.0,Was NOT waterproof at all. And it's so thin my clients shirts get wet when I use a water mister.
1.0,Does not look or fit at all like the picture looks.
1.0,"The product used for the ad and what I got are not even close. The dark sandy substance looks like colored sugar for decorating cookies and the tree of life appears ready to fall off. I know that these are all hand made and you have to allow for this, I ordered it knowing each would be unique but poorly done I didn't want."
1.0,This is cheaply made and not helpful after third use it no longer holds clasp. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Doesn't change the voice at all. Pretty cool looking mask but we bought it for the voice changing ability. Pretty disappointed.
1.0,I really don't know how these fit because I wouldn't put them on they smelled of mildew - either from storage or they are old or something is very wrong.  Horrible strong smell of mildew.  I threw them away.
1.0,The color is off. Not a deep red... too orangey.
1.0,This xxl didnt even fit my 8 year old whomever is making these needs to stop
1.0,Product did not flash as advertised
1.0,Ridiculously Long !
1.0,Not right look for me
1.0,So cute but broke within 1 week. Very weak material.
1.0,I wear a 3x and did the recommended size up bc its tight. But its wayyy to tight i couldnt get the 4x zip up to fight to get it on. Product came with the seams at the bottom ripped but bc i was excited to sweat and try it anyways i went to the gym and felt like i didnt sweat as much as if I just didnt wear it. Dont have time to return it so I guess im just eating it
1.0,Product returned.
1.0,"I was so excited when I got this as it was really pretty and exactly what I wanted. However, I was wearing it for less than an hour when I looked down and it was gone. Clasp must have malfunctioned. I retraced my steps but no luck. So disappointing."
1.0,AWEFULLY MADE
1.0,Too tight. Small child size not adult size.  Size 8 hat.
1.0,"Montura muy frágil, la medida de los cristales no se ajusta a lo deseado."
1.0,"First order came wrong size. Returned and reordered ,came with mildew splotches all over. Yuck!"
1.0,Horrible because they’re all the same size
1.0,"This is for youth or someone with a small head.  I agree with other reviews, it is very flimsy with a weak clasp.<br />Don't waste your money."
1.0,Ring is copper color underneath the silver coating also quality is very poor on craftsmanship.
1.0,No stars at all but since one is tequired for submission. This item came broken. The company new as they used wire and twisted (like a bread tie) chain pieces together. I also had to reglue 18 gems.
1.0,Style and color are perfect but quality is horrible
1.0,"It looks very nice, i won't lie, even got compliments for it on the market. But the quality is terrible. It lasted a day."
1.0,These shoes are a piece of crap! I wore them twice and they are treating apart in the front.
1.0,These were very cute but after I have worn a few time the butt material just shred!!!! They are crap I've only worn them a few times.
1.0,"my husband has only worn this maybe 10-15 times and the zippers already broken, seams are already tearing apart.  Usually his jackets last at least a year, usually 2 years."
1.0,"I was unhappy that I didn’t notice these are studs, which is odd for a dangle earring. When I wore the red ones for the first time the yard untied and started falling out."
1.0,"The photo clearly shows that the pj bottoms are mid calf length.  What i received were shorts. Definitely not what i wanted or ordered,  so this is going back."
1.0,Arrived broken. Says I can't return/exchange it.
1.0,Material was too cheap looking and an off color. Also order a 2x and it looked more like a medium.
1.0,Very unhappy I ordered short sleeves got long. Not messing with sending back to China. I’ve learned to read where amazon clothes come from. It runs extra small.
1.0,The picture made it look like it was going to be a nice quality plane tank. It's practically see-thru. Stay away from this.
1.0,"Does not work. Do not get warm I tried switching batteries,changing around the battery packs and they simply don't work. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I normally fit an extra large and a 2X but I like to buy 2x for some shirts just to leave a little more wiggle room but not even the 2X fits me it’s super tight and super short terrible! sizing is way off!
1.0,These are so cheap. So i am 5 foot 3 and 170 pound my daughter is 5 foot 4 and 120 pounds they fit us both.  They go up really high on us both and are like pantyhose extremely  see through on us both. The print is very cheap looking too.
1.0,The headband that I received was not the one pictured.
1.0,These are just cheap sunglasses. They are not worth more than $5. They also do not correct color blindness. Stay away and buy something else.
1.0,Very very cheap bendy don’t purchase..couldn’t even tell which pair was which ..
1.0,"I purchased the Women's Tri-Block Low Cut No Show Sock 4-Pack for $39.90 directly from Bombas on May 1 2021. I am writing my review here because there is currently no option to leave a review on the Bombas website and I would like to save y'all some dang money. I wore these socks every now and again, maybe a total of ten or so times per each pair and two of the socks quickly developed holes on the mid metarsalgia area (like the area on the upper palm of your hand, but on your foot). Never again will I purchase Bombas socks.<br /><br />I have 6 pairs of Keds no show socks that I purchased from Marshalls for about $10 or less and have owned those Keds socks since 2016 and let me tell you... those bad boys have held up over the years through I don't even know how many wears/uses and still have zero holes and show no sign of wear or tear.<br /><br />Please save yourself the money and do not buy these ridiculously expensive and poorly made socks."
1.0,Makes you look larger than you are
1.0,"I have owned Curren watches before. They are hit or miss, this one is garbage.  It is an attractive time piece though."
1.0,Not what I expect.  The materials was thick polyester and too hot for wearing in the summer.  This should not be considered a summer dress.
1.0,Coat tag stated it was the size I ordered.  It was in all actuality at least 3 sizes too small.  Very disappointed!!
1.0,Owned it for less than a week and the watch has already broken. Very dissapointed. The hole on the watch where the metal pin in the wristband connects has broken.
1.0,"I wish I could post a picture of how this bathing suit looks on me, but it would get flagged.. I’m a 34 D in bra size so I generally always wear medium tops in bikinis. WELL LET ME JUST TELL YA, size up 2X. On top of that, their is a cheap metal clasp on the back and I can see how it could actually burn you if it got to hot. Quality of actually material was good, just way to small and cheap metal clasp!<br /><br />I would order a larger size but they don’t offer free returns in certain sizes. So return it is."
1.0,Poor quality as I have a hard time fitting the closing to the earring and the earring is bended. It definitely does not look as good as the picture.
1.0,It was not quality and broke quickly
1.0,"If I could give it fewer stars, I would. Cheap! Broke quickly. Never again."
1.0,Colors run together and no doubt will be worse after washing.
1.0,"This item is clearly misrepresented by the main image, which shows the necklace presented with a message card about the intended symbolism of the key pendant. Rather, it arrives thrown haphazardly into a disposable paper jewelry box without the message card. With nothing included to signify what it's meant to be the &#34;key to...&#34; it's just a cheap, tiny, key-to-whatever pendant on a cheap chain. I didn't expect fine jewelry for the price nor did I particularly need or want to give something much finer to my young daughter anyway, but I was hoping to have a good conversation about that message and will now have to make something myself to go along with it instead. I should have read the reviews beforehand. I hope this one might catch a few people's attention to save them the disappointment."
1.0,Not as pictured. Too heavy of a material for summer and the color looks more like a cheap t-shirt. The material is so heavy that I feel like it would stretch out the straps too far.
1.0,"The band did not fit as I had hoped.  Not secure. Had to send it back. Will keep my old one, similar but better.  The company of the old one is no longer on the Web site."
1.0,They came bent when I tried to bend the straight they broke never even got to wear them
1.0,"Received earrings today one was missing a feather and only had two the other earring had three.. very sad I was super excited to receive and wear.., will be returning."
1.0,EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY …..And the company makes it impossible to get your $70 back after the sandals breaks.
1.0,Do NOT buy these.  They are not fog free and they fit poorly
1.0,honestly way too small and overpriced for the money  ..perhaps I should have read the dimensions more closely however the reviews  seemed enthralled ..I gOT this as a novel idea for a  valentines day present ..looks like ill be running out for some last minute chocolate and flowers after all :(
1.0,"This company CLAIMS to have this lifetime warranty to back their product! They CLAIM that if it’s lost, stretched, ripped, etc. that they will replace it for free, forever!! Well, I have sent them two emails and a Facebook message for them to honor this warranty... and guess what!? Crickets. Never heard back from them! I don’t normally leave reviews but this has me upset. I am in Law Enforcement. I was wearing my ring to work, and it slipped off while on duty. I was hoping to replace is... and I received absolutely no response!! Very disappointed!!!"
1.0,"I am a 34 D, borderline DD. I expected this be a bra, and a little small, but that my boobs would just pop out the top and it'd be sexy. Instead, this bandeau-like thing acts like a binder, and I found myself staring in the mirror wondering where my girls went. A tiny bit of cleavage escapes it, but nothing like what I have usually, even wearing a sports bra. I wish lingerie could be returned! I guess I'll show this to my fiance anyways, it's not very comfortable or sexy in my opinion, but he did ask for it and I hate throwing new stuff away."
1.0,The Junior's medium is equivalent to a little girl's size 7/8.  I gave it to my 7 year old niece and it fits HER perfectly.
1.0,Not true to size way too smal
1.0,"This thing was horrible! The breast part won't stay closed. It's not very good material. Wash it once and it's ruined, by hand too!!"
1.0,Arrived filthy dirty
1.0,"While the fit is great, they are not scratch resistant. After one outing of riding they are all scratched. Very disappointing!"
1.0,The shirts are supposed to be 4xl but it’s more of a large for a teenager! I will never spend any more money with you!
1.0,I'm a size 29 to 30. And yet I got a size 34.
1.0,Top hangs funny. Top part through the sleeves has no division making it really uncomfortable. Material is just so so.
1.0,"After one wash, with it being inside out, the logo melted and came off...I don’t even use a high setting.  My son was very sad."
1.0,They don't stay up and keep rolling down. I wouldn't purchase again
1.0,It’s not long like it’s supposed to be and it’s to small not a 2x like should be. Material isn’t good at all falling apart I’m sending it back
1.0,"Strike 1: We ordered 4, only 2 of 4 were ""matches"" with the same colors and etc.<br /><br />Strike 2: They all feel unbelievably cheap and the material is super questionable. As in one was for a baby and I didn't feel comfortable letting the baby wear it.<br /><br />Strike 3: We washed just the baby's and the colors faded probably 30-40%. Not an exaggeration.... I feel like 30-40% may even be giving them too much credit. I have more t-shirts I've owned for over a year and have been washed 30+ times at a minimum and still have held better color than that. It looked so washed out it was laughable.<br /><br />Paid nearly $100 for a set of 4 family pajamas. Absolute JOKE and waste. Thankfully Amazon let me return no issues at all. Don't waste your time."
1.0,Very cheap material and the fit was awkward.
1.0,"when i got this product, it was broken. I put it back together and it broke again. Will not be buying this again.."
1.0,this item is not suitable for Garmin Vivoactive 3 at all. It will cover the senses on the left hand side  .
1.0,2 of the anklets broke the same day I put them on.  I know they weren’t very expensive but I expected better.
1.0,Received Used Dress today that has been worn and has ink spots and perfume in dress. It’s completely stretched out. Totally shocked<br />I’m hoping this doesn’t happen again
1.0,I ordered a 38DDD. The cup size was right but the it was maybe a 34! So not pleased.
1.0,"Returned the pajamas.<br />The material was inferior, and the proportions were skimpy.<br />I wouldn't even give it a 1 star review, except that I couldn't delete the one star... ."
1.0,"The top was a little small, but the bottoms were fine. I’m 5’5” and weigh 140. If you don’t have a large bust the medium may fit fine. My objection was they weren’t comfortable at all. Sweats should be super comfy. These were scratchy and they had been washed. I could only wear them for 15 minutes before removing. Since they’ve been washed and dried I can’t send back, so will give them away."
1.0,"Doesn’t stay closed, I wear it on my ankle instead"
1.0,Very disappointed too small
1.0,What a pill! Great product! Pills up instantly! Fine China.
1.0,"I bought this product based on design and functions. I like the shape of the watch and size of its display. Unfortunately, it completely stopped working six days after I received it. Either they sent it with a bad battery or, it is not designed to last more than six days. I would be happy to try a new battery (if the seller would send me one). I get the impression that the seller knows this product doesn't last more than six days and assumes that it's not worth the trouble of returning it."
1.0,This item is not true to size at all. I ordered an XL like always and this is like a XL Small. I fit my 14 year old so well.
1.0,Does not fit true to size and the mesh was itchy. 2 pairs were too small in the legs and waist. The other one was too large in both the legs and waist. All were supposed to be the same size.
1.0,I ordered my 6 ft tall 220 lbs husband this so called military tactical undershirt in XL. Let just start by saying if you’re 5 ft tall and around a 115 lbs petite this size would fit you.  It fit him like a crop top would fit. Don’t waste $35 on this search for something else.
1.0,This product took one month to be delivered. Came in a single use plastic bag so that it was virtually difficult to return to sender and one would need to find a box for return.There were no invoice in package.Contacted sender to cancel order and it was not an easy process.<br />The jacket is more suited for fall jacket. Material is very lightweight with a very thin lining  -appears heavier in picture. Jacket sizing for large was very tight fit and the tag in the jacket did not have a size printed on it.<br />.
1.0,Gems fell out with in a few days
1.0,Very ugly returned product don't buy fabric horrible
1.0,terrible and cheap
1.0,Hurts does not stretch enough
1.0,This was a very thin flimsy fabric and sized way too small. Had to return it.
1.0,"I was excited to try these on, but was disappointed to see how sheer these were. The only thing I liked about the leggings was the compression. I bought the navy blue ones in a medium (I’m 5’6” and 145lbs). I do have a fuller posterior, and the leggings were see through before checking to see if they were squat proof. The material is very thin. I will be investing in a higher quality pair that doesn’t show my rear."
1.0,"I was hesitant about this shirt since the buttons are Very hard to secure and separate. As you can see, the back ripped right out when I tried to open it. Kind of stiff material too, but haven’t washed them yet to see if they soften after. Bought two and returning both. They have got to fix the buttons."
1.0,Not made for the average African American woman's build.
1.0,** Fit as expected** when arrived but was a childs sock size after ONE wash. See the sock (checkered one) beside the normal sized sock (white one) that  I've been washing for 2 years.
1.0,The lettering on this bag is PInK and not white as in the photo. This is supposed to be a gift for a boy. Grrrr
1.0,Must have been a fluke.  Bought a cursive L which looked like part of it was missing. Returned with no problems.
1.0,"Do NOT buy this watch, if you are a woman!! It fell off my wrist it was so large. I am royally annoyed that they do NOT speciify this is only for MEN!!!"
1.0,The size was way wrong. It could fit around my thumb. I would have returned it or contacted the seller but it wasn't a priorty in the middle of planning a wedding. The ring itself was pretty unappealing anyway.
1.0,The fit was great but as soon as my grandson put them on he slid and fell twice.  Definitely not non skid.
1.0,too small and made of cheap material.
1.0,cups were waaaay too small
1.0,Pretty much a non functioning item. It does not enhance anything. Or reduce glare! The only difference vs a naked eye is it adds a light yellow hue to the view. Pretty much a worthless product for the stated intended use.
1.0,"I will need to move up a size for this shirt to be comfortable.  Also, because of the way the shirt is positioned on the web page. I did not notice it had a number &#34;3&#34; on the right shirt sleeve.  Definitely my fault for not looking closer but if I had noticed that, I would not have purchased the shirt."
1.0,Received a different brand hat without a face shield. Please refund.
1.0,Color was wrong and it was so hard to fit it back together. I stretched it and put it back together. One of the bees wings almost overlapped the screw point. Spent 1hour trying with it.
1.0,Absolutely about 2 sizes smaller. It's also stretchy which is odd. It mentions it nowhere and by the photo they provide it looks like a reg cotton shirt. I couldn't even send it back sadly.  Don't buy those just find from someone local.
1.0,So tiny. Pull my husband's ears so far forward he looks like a grateful dead dumbo. Not a good look. Unfortunately only a child or a very small adult could wear these comfortably. Jerry would not have approved.
1.0,Ordered a size bigger because i was expecting it to be smaller. Still way to small
1.0,"The picture is cute, but the dress I received does not look like the picture. The stripes at the top of this dress are uneven and it looks ugly. Instead of an even black band around the top, it looks like white puffy stuff is coming out of one side because of the uneven stripes. I will not be wearing this. I tried to return it and was given a message that my return gap has closed and it's no longer eligible for return. I orderd it exactly a month ago and I've been out of town and figured I'd have 90 days or so to return. I've never had a problem returning Amazon items. Now I'm stuck with this dress. Do not buy this dress. It will not look like the picture and it's not worth the hassle."
1.0,Shrunk after one wash! To much to a sleep outfit for a one time use.
1.0,Not at all as expected. The shirt barely came to the top of my pants. And the color was more of a neon pink than mauve. I returned it.
1.0,Cheap doesnt look like whats shown
1.0,"the fit was much smaller, wanted to send back seller denied my return, stuck with it laying around & cant wear"
1.0,Have purchased other 2X pants like this and had room to move. Not so with these!
1.0,Run to small and poorly stitched.  I wanted to return but not worth the shipping and handling
1.0,Received damaged item. A charm was missing and the tie string was poorly contructed! Flimsy bracelet!
1.0,"poor fit run small, poor quality of workmanship."
1.0,"Sent in a box, no shoe/boot box at all.... If these are legitimate why wouldn't they have the original packaging?  Will not order from this seller again.  Having the original box is important to me for storage and closet neatness/organization.  I have yet to find a plastic tote to fit this purpose....  The calves of these boots are tiny, the feet are great, just can't zip them."
1.0,Poorly designed- the opening is tiny
1.0,I would not suggest buying these earrings.
1.0,"Gloves are good quality and fit well. Unfortunately, they sent us two right-handed gloves. Gonna have to try to make it work because it’s for my daughters costume. She’s not looking forward to having her hand amputated and sewn on backwards for the day."
1.0,Looking for a xl size
1.0,Too long for a 34&#34;
1.0,Such a low quality of material it got so ugly in 2 days
1.0,Used less than 2 weeks around the house and already cracked clean through in multiple spots. Waste of money
1.0,"I couldn't tell from the picture that the handle is a very tacky bright, glittering metallic gold that doesn't suit the bag at all.  It's so hideous that I will not carry the bag unless I find a way to cover the handle."
1.0,All of the clamps fell off first use
1.0,This wasn't sewn right.  Returning.  Seems like it was made in some non fair trade sweatshop.
1.0,Extremely cheaply made and unattractive.
1.0,Took almost 2 months to arrive. Horrible product. Put in for a return as soon as it arrived. Looks like my 8 year old niece made it with her printer and transfer paper. Paid close to $14 total. Company only willing to refund $8 but told me to keep the hat. Yeah I kept it long enough to throw it away. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"These are utterly trash. I am fairly sure I bought something out of a gumball machine once as a kid that was better quality. The edges of the hoops are sharp and you couldn't pay me to put these in!!! For a description that says they use cubic zirconia, gold and sterling they seem to have really wild imaginations. The paint is clearly bubbling...and the charms are on backwards."
1.0,"It was super cut for the SECONDS I had it on, until it broke off..."
1.0,Cute from afar.  Cheap
1.0,"Sizing way too small, short in length"
1.0,Super cool!  But the product title should be &#34;Round Retro Vintage Sunglasses For Newborns.&#34;  Because they are T I N Y.  Definitely can't wear them (and I doubt any other human above the age of 7 could either).
1.0,Very bad quality of material!!!!
1.0,Way to small and didn't fit me.  It did fit on my leg.  I also found hanging threads from the fabric on the inside which would indicate poor workmanship.  The fabric is very thin and seemed to be poor quality.  Made in China.
1.0,Color looks pale I got rose quartz 🙅 happy
1.0,Disappointed. Bought for my son. All shirts seams were unraveling and the white shirt arrived filthy. Stained all over. Returning and trying to find a better product.
1.0,"First let me say these did fit good BUT I ordered these January 8th for my daughter. Today is the 23rd and I noticed she was wobbling a little on her feet.  I asked if her feet hurt or something and she said no her shoes felt wierd. So I took them off of her.  Now, I work in a cobbler shop and fix shoes, so I knew these weren't great when I bought them but this is a bit ridiculous! She's worn them to school maybe 5/6 times and the heel is separating from the shoe.  I'm also pretty positive they can't be saved even with glue.<br />Im going to take them to work and try and will update later but I'm not holding my breath.  These might be the worst pair of boots I've ever bought! I'm pretty disappointed in the quality."
1.0,Really didn't improve wife's night vision.
1.0,"These masks do not look like tie dye as advertised. Also, they were marketed as youth masks and they are huge. Disappointing..."
1.0,I received just the bag with no glasses in the  bag
1.0,Split open at the area expericed least amount of stress after been worn ten times.  Hope the seller does the right thing to refund me or send me a replacement pair
1.0,"Not even close to the color of grey shown, very thin and had a cut in the edge of the shirt"
1.0,"Heavy, can’t wear all day."
1.0,No. It sux
1.0,Style doesn’t look like the picture. Small means xsmall. Doesn’t even have the similar cuts. It’s actually darker than the photo. Don’t get it it’s awful I’m returning it and it took forever to get
1.0,"I ordered or and it was not stiched right, I ordered another one and it wasn't right neither I never tried to get my money back, shame on me."
1.0,"Was misleading. Thought I was getting a bundle with different colors, not one for 10bucks!"
1.0,I though the entire arm would be snaps. It wasn't so I returned.
1.0,Couldn’t even insert into my piercing
1.0,Sizes not u.s sizes
1.0,Changed color and broke!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d1852e3292a30bbf489f57ae2167ad4e]] The silicone rings faded within two weeks my husband and I are very disappointed I do not recommend these
1.0,This was an actual frump sack.
1.0,"No me gusta el aspecto, es simple, fea y me luce poco resistente."
1.0,"Unless you have an A-cup, I doubt this bra will work for you. It is very soft and comfortable, but provides absolutely zero support."
1.0,Cheapest most poorly made hat i own. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"Xl is not an xl it fits like a small, no stretch to it, it fit like a tshirt. Scratchy material. Do not recommend"
1.0,Was getting them for work...too big all my other shrub pants are3x these fit like 5x..
1.0,badly cut at the top.  We will toss it.
1.0,"I’ve ordered this dress in the past ( because it’s knit, stains don’t come out well so I order a new one every year or so)and it has always been actually cotton and it’s been fantastic. This particular one is not cotton even though it’s labeled as such. The first time I wore it, on a cruise, I sweat like I only do in polyester (which is why I say I’m allergic to it), and I could not get it off fast enough. I’m very disappointed!"
1.0,These are the worst socks ever! I can't figure out how they have so many positive reviews. I am on the smaller end of the size spectrum for these (size 6.5) with narrow feet and they are so tight in my toes that my feet hurt the entire time I am wearing them. I'm so bummed but will be tossing all of these after only a few tries!
1.0,Lo compré y no duró ni una semana se rompió ..son de muy mala calidad
1.0,Not sure if this is a manufacturers defect but ankle strap does not fit at all.  Cannot wear these sandals.
1.0,No no no! Too bulky and cumbersome. It's collecting dust in my closet and not trimming my waist. Total waste (no pun intended) of money.
1.0,"It came fast , but all smashed in , not good at all :("
1.0,Jewels started falling out.
1.0,"I absolutely hated this dress and gave it away quickly after getting it in the mail. My problems with it are as follows..<br />•It is made of a cheap and thin slip/swimsuit/leotard material. It has a shine to it and is very transparent. It seems to highlight and amplify every bump and curve you may have on your body.<br />•It is sized with Asian sizes. This means that though I am typically a size medium shirt and 4-6 pants in US sizes their medium dress was far too small for me. If you do decide to purchase this dress, go up a size. It was also too short. I'm only 5'4.<br />•It took forever to get. It was shipped from china so that's to be expected but still this was bothersome.<br />•The pattern and dress itself look nothing like the pictures. It's a completely different dress shown in the pictures than what I got in the mail. The one I got had  flowers that were much larger and more tacky looking.<br /><br />Overall I was highly disappointed in this dress. It didn't fit as it should have and appeared to be made for a child. The print didn't match that of the dress shown in the pictures. It was made of a cheap shiny material. And it took forever to get."
1.0,"I originally rated this tank with five stars, it was thick and seemed well made. Then I washed it. It collected Lent like you would not believe, it looks misshapen, I don't know what happened but it's unwearable."
1.0,"Baby blues and darker blues, but not a dark wash a all. Returned without trying it on because it looked a different tee."
1.0,Not at all what I thought. The picture did not represent the “jacket”. It was more like an indoor article of clothing. It was very nappy. It looked ragged. I was disappointed to say the least.<br />The sizing was small. Very tight around my arms. I returned it for a refund.
1.0,"The sweatshirt is not the same later at a sweatshirt, it also runs very small."
1.0,Cute dress but the sleeves on this dress are off by a lot. This in turn makes the arm holes off and makes the dress visibly odd and uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,Sizing way too small
1.0,The buttons are missing cheap quality. I'm returning it. And I am about to discontinue my prime account. You are letting too many bogus vendors on here.
1.0,Broke the first day I put it on my daughter
1.0,These need to be fit to the user
1.0,Didn’t look like the pics. Very cheap thin quality. Nothing like the pictures
1.0,Ripped after 6 wears
1.0,They are uglier than the picture and temporarily dented my baby's head after it was on her for an hour.
1.0,"WAY too small, and the fabric is crazy thin. An XL is not an XL. It fits my roommate; who is a size 8."
1.0,It does not fit human beings and it is so complicated
1.0,Color scale SO WRONG!!!!
1.0,"I ordered two pairs of these<br />One fits perfect nice and comfy ,the other is way too small"
1.0,"this was see through, very cheap"
1.0,This did not come in the purple pictured on amazon.. very dissatisfied with that.. otherwise everything else was right.
1.0,"This is not a sarong, this is cheap printed material, I was afraid of this when purchasing it and instant regret now that I'm seeing and feeling it, this is more on part with something to hang on a wall than Sinton you can actually wear with comfort."
1.0,Totally ridiculous they recommended a 2 x i got a 3 x this thing wouldn't fit my 13 year old granddaughter!
1.0,I order with plenty of time and the biggest size fits like a 5 yr old so dissatisfied so small I haven't get a chance to return this is an inconvenience so disappointed waste of time and money 😞
1.0,The floral print on the dress i recieved is nothing like what is pictured. The dress is cute but if you order one thing and receive another it is upsetting.
1.0,Don't waste your money...if you wear anything above an A cup.
1.0,My daughter loved the softness and colors
1.0,It looked nothing like the picture. It's more of a t-shirt material than sweater.
1.0,I don’t find it comfortable. It’s useable but I won’t use it for long. I ordered color white and it has very tiring yellow hue to it. I’m disappointed.
1.0,"The Shield Armor of God Ephesians, Faith Cross Stainless Steel Pendant Necklace didn't have a clasp, no return sticker found. I bought a total of 3. One gold, One Black, that came with no clasp to connect the pendant necklace. However,<br />the Silver Pendant was perfect which came in a package alone, the other two came in one package, probably a ""fake"" product."
1.0,The fabric is really cheap and it feels like a horrible Halloween costume
1.0,"Doesn't stay adhered at all, teeny tiny soles!"
1.0,hated it!  most came with Christmas and Halloween prints.  I chose the rainbow print and only one came with rainbow print
1.0,it looks nothing like the picture it’s false advertising it’s an ugly light blue instead of a beautiful radiant picture it It doesn’t look good at all do not buy
1.0,I ordered this item. But was shipped some random pendant. The have failed to respond to multiple emails asking them to correct the problem. Luckily I was fortunate not to make a large purchase with them. Would not do business with these theives again.
1.0,It would fit if you were buying it for a child
1.0,Lace separated from sick just pulling them up to wear...Before even one wash.
1.0,"So, I order this watch as a gift and it comes out of the box...already not working? I've purchased many watches and every single one comes ready to wear out of the box; for some reason, this one isn't working at all! Not sure if it has a dead battery or no battery at all, but I'll be sure to tell everyone not to purchase from this seller. This is just stupid..."
1.0,"took almost 2 months to come from China ,paper thin just hope she likes it"
1.0,Only one pair of the four were anything like the picture. Returning and regret purchasing!!
1.0,Terrible product. I bought this watch last year and today doesn’t work. I changed the battery and still not working. Don’t buy it!
1.0,These panties run a whole size to small. Make sure to take that into count when you order them.
1.0,It's hard to keep on your face because the top of it just rolls down. It would have been nice if the top was slightly reinforced to keep that from happening.
1.0,"I am really bummed because I was over zealous and bought 2 packages, I always wash before I wear and these especially had a mechanical odor.  they really twisted up."
1.0,Toooooooo big! If I can get it to stay up it goes as high as my bottom eye lashes. Became a dog toy
1.0,This product fits smaller than actual size. Probably need to go up a size.
1.0,washed once and item threads came out and very poor material
1.0,did nothing to block the sun
1.0,Wear a large and a XXL was too small
1.0,The necklace wasn’t even able to be put on. Horrible quality. Needs different style clasp
1.0,"i had to send it back. it was tiny and looked like a sleeve of a running shirt.  it was also so thin you could see thru it, like a nylon.  there’s no way it would protect against breathing in others germs."
1.0,"I ordered this dress for myself, however... the dress I received was the same color and amazing material....but an entirely different cut"
1.0,Definitely meant for smaller chested woman. I got a large and it definitely lacked coverage.
1.0,NUNCA ME LLEGÓ Y NO ME RESPONDIERON
1.0,Fit was odd. The ruffle hits at a funny spot and isn’t very flattering. Not a fan of the shirt. I returned it and only got half credit. No clue why so just don’t buy it to begin with.
1.0,"I read the reviews of others stating this was extremely short, but thought that if I ordered the largest size (size 11-13) for my 9 year old I would be fine. Nope! This fit like a long shirt for sure! Definitely not a coverup! Not to mention it's just cheap. The design of the cut is just wonky. Poor quality, poor design, and poorly made. Going back!"
1.0,Arrived missing earring hook.
1.0,"I love the colors and the material, however the straps make it impossible to wear. I tried removing the elastic but that didn't work. The straps are too short even without the elastic. If I hadn't tried to make it work then I would've returned the dress. Really wanted to wear it."
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap. The lining is incredibly noisey it sounds like a newspaper.
1.0,"Material was very thin and cheap, seemed really impractical. Ran small. Returned."
1.0,These leggings are not supportive and do not hold anything in. They are too loose and the material does not have the best supportive material for high intensity workouts. I’m usually a Medium but these were too big.
1.0,"It's cute , But too small ... it suck my daughter we'll never wear it and I order it one size bigger what she is..."
1.0,I received mine it was already opened and theres a white plastic glued to the fabric it’s very disappointing! The price is not reasonable for such bad quality
1.0,This was very big on me and did not sit well. It was so very long. I could have made a second dress with all the extra fabric. I’m 5 4 so I was expecting to need it fixed but it would have cost more than the dress.
1.0,I have a bunch of different tank top prints from Bold Banana and I LOVE them. This tank is cut differently and fits differently than all the others that I have. Not very flattering and lots of extra fabric near my armpits.
1.0,I don’t like the clasp. Too delicate and afraid it may break. I thought it would be more sturdy for the money. Very flimsy. I’m afraid to wear it.
1.0,They are just OK the graphics are very thin lined and hard to see
1.0,"I just got it in the mail, and the black color isn't shining at all. It's all grey and looks cheaply made. Looks NOTHING like the pictures at all. It also came in a box, all messed up inside. Like someone just threw it in there and took no care of them. I'll NEVER purchase from this company again! EVER. Such lies."
1.0,The ring for the Apple Tag was jacked up. It looked used or something. Don’t buy this wallet.
1.0,"Officially returning these bracelets back to Amazon because the charms fell off of BOTH bracelets. I do not recommend buying ANY products from this seller at all because the quality is cheap and terrible! I’ve received two items from this seller and both broke within a short amount of time. DO NOT BUY!!!<br /><br />Update:<br />I just received an email from the seller telling me that if I delete my review, I will receive more free items from them. Yeah, right 🤣 This review is staying right where it belongs! You people need to be exposed for your trash products and trash attempt to influence MY review! 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"
1.0,"would not recommend.  it does not look or feel like a compression athletic tank, fits and feels like a regular sport top."
1.0,"While it is a very cute piece, it should have been 25 cents in a gumball machine. Very cheap. It is NOT a size 7.5 in the slightest. Wife is a size 5.75 and the ring was still significantly too small. Extremely fragile but can be carefully manipulated in to size. Wife bought it for a concert but she is concerned it will break before we make it from the parking lot to inside the venue."
1.0,Don't waste your money not as advertised. The material is heavy and it's more difficult to breath through than the regular blue surgical masks everyone is wearing. Terrible and I definitely do not recommend buying this product. Regular disposable masks are much more comfortable.
1.0,Looks 10x better in the picture then in person.
1.0,"If you want a muumuu, this is the dress for you. Aside from the pattern the dress looks nothing like it"
1.0,VERY THIN!! SEE THROUGH! AND CAME DIRTY WITH SPOTS THAT WONT WASH AWAY
1.0,They don’t fit or stay in the rings
1.0,It didn't look anything like the picture...and I didn't like the fabric either. And it was too small.
1.0,Not for me.  Very orange color.  The letter doesn’t even lay flat on your chest.  I threw it out.
1.0,I returned this.  Not for full-breasted women.
1.0,The material is not good!! Too big and small at the same time. Was not happy unfortunately with this purchase.
1.0,"Worst material ever. Definitely not wool, plain Hanes cotton socks are much better fitting and keep my sons feet warmer than these overpriced cheap thin socks."
1.0,"This blouse is horrible!  The fabric wrinkles and you can’t get them out.  Also, the neck is cut so high, it cuts into my neck."
1.0,"Why would anyone put an inside seam on riding pants? These appear to be leggings that someone stuck silicone on and rebranded as riding pants. If you’re the person who can ride in leggings or jeans, these pants are for you! If you’ve ever gotten rubs from riding in pants with a seam, you will immediately cringe when you take them out of the packaging. Do they rub? I have no clue, it wasn’t worth $33 to me to find out."
1.0,I've bought these shirts a few times before. They fit me well and generally last for four or five months of heavy gym use before they begin to smell so bad that no amount of washing will make them wearable. I don't mind that- they're cheap enough and I get enough use out of them to make it worth it to me. What I don't like is paying for a three pack and only receiving two out of the three items.
1.0,wrong  color. Wanted pink. Got white.
1.0,It looks cheap and the switches aren’t perfect
1.0,Really poor quality plastic copy!
1.0,Would rate zero if i could.  Needed this costume for a New Year's costume party. Arrived Dec. 31st and was unable to use it.<br /><br />The item looked like it was used and then shoved into the package again.  What is worse is the fan for this INFLATABLE costume is missing.  It's not on the hole where it belongs and is nowhere inside the packaging.
1.0,"After wearing this item for just two days, the chain broke.  Beyond frustrating.  Should come with a better necklace chain."
1.0,"Ew, why would you ever wear a dress made out of this kind of jersey fabric. Ew"
1.0,"A couple issues. Took these bottoms on a couple different rides because I really wanted them to work, but I just put myself through more pain. First I wore them on a 71 mile bike ride, and had to change halfway through the ride. I’m LUCKY I brought a change of bike bottoms with me. The padding didn’t work at all my sits bones were extremely sore. The chaffing was awful (while using chamois butter) in the bikini line crease And the butt to back of the leg crease. I ordered the right size so fit wasn’t the issue it was bad design. In those skin creases there was a useless excess of fabric that bunched up and would cause chafing. I tried them on a shorter 15 mile ride a couple weeks later. Nope still bad chaffing and no padding support. My sits bones got soooo sore the padding was basically useless. Tried them a third time but just had to call it quits and threw them away 15 miles into a 100 mile bike ride. Was very disappointed."
1.0,This is a beutiful crafted  product . But the durability and stiching work is so week and cheap. The shoulder strape is not durable even though and under easy normal daily use.  I used it one week by Friday the strap brook . This should not be for a real leather  bag. ☹
1.0,My son only wore the glasses less than a handful of times before they broke. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I went to put it on and it broke... not repairable either. Don't buy, it's cheap and breaks too easily."
1.0,Too small and keeps riding up. It definitely seems like it would flaten if it wasn't so small so I could actually be able to put it on without dislocation my hips and arms pulling it up.<br />Waited to long to return it. So now it's just sitting in a misc bag on my house.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture.  5'6 and it don't come to my ankles. Returning
1.0,Could not even get on. Suppose to be relaxed fit. Even ordered XL. Worthless to me
1.0,"There is a hideous seam right down the front of this shirt. The color is beautiful, the material is soft, it fits well, but the seam down the middle looks like open heart surgery was performed on the shirt. If I didn't need a shirt this color for an event I’d return it."
1.0,This is literally impossible to get on and fastened by yourself.
1.0,Product was not good quality. I should have expected that from price.
1.0,Egh not really a fan. Super cute glasses but cheap frames & they are so wide they don’t even stay on my face when I look down. If you got a wide head these may be your jam. The aviators are way better.
1.0,"Unfortunately, the tops run small so I had to return them. I returned both in the same package and have received a refund for one of the tops, but not the other. Please help."
1.0,"I was super excited about this wood watch... until it stopped working.  Within a week or so after receiving it, it started sporadically stopping.  But I would re-set it and it would start again.  Until it finally stopped working altogether after maybe one month max.  Figuring maybe the battery needed replacing, I tried that, which took me a while to find & purchase the right battery.  (busy working mom!!)  But that didn't work, so now I'm stuck with this non-working watch. :(  Oh well, back to Timex for me!!  I'm just bummed I couldn't get my money back on this defective watch, because I can't see a way to return it at this point.  I guess I gave it too many chances to work and am now outside the window for returns.  Sad. :("
1.0,Not what’s pictured really cheap quality and sizing is way off
1.0,My son got a splash of water on his watch from the hosepipe and now the entire screen is fogged up. Don't believe this watch's claims to be water resistant!
1.0,"First, I want to comment that the sellers refusal to publish 'what the fabric is made of' really annoyed me. ""Cotton Feel"" is not a valid answer.  Plus it doesn't 'feel'or act like cotton, in my opinion. Synthetic fabric has no body and just hangs straight down. Slippery synthetic won't let me arrange or adjust the scarf.  I was out of town so I missed the return date.  Waste of money for me. And I bought 2 of them!  Donating to Goodwill."
1.0,Too tight across the chest.  Needed to return it.  My wife was heartbroken.
1.0,Very poor quality! The seam on the front of the slipper ripped as soon as my granddaughter put her foot in!
1.0,Gold faded off within a week
1.0,Will never order this again poor quality and looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,"Wrong color, boo.  Got over that, but then noticed the pulled strings dangling, boo.  Fine, it'll be a house sweater.  Washed it, air dried it, n it shrank, boo."
1.0,"VERY poor quality!  Runs extremely small.  Sadly, has to go back."
1.0,Runs really small I gave it to my daughter
1.0,I really liked how simple it looked but the watch only worked for about one week and then stopped. I tried everything to get it to work.
1.0,"It broke as soon as I tried to use it,never again"
1.0,"The mdse is nice, but the listing said it was for a pack of 2.  I only received a packet of 1!"
1.0,"This dress doesn't meet the chart measurements.  It's way too large and the most disappointing thing is the colors are not as shown.  It's drab and dull.  The worst part is that although I can return the item, I have to pay shipping.  I do not recommend this seller or this dress."
1.0,"yes light weight, but crooked... couldnt bend the way i needed it.  broke frame trying."
1.0,The product did not look like sister pins that were advertised. Very cheap quality. I was extremely disappointed.🤨 Does not deserve any stars.
1.0,material is cheap.
1.0,You are paying 50 bucks for two pieces of plastics. It's amazing what a terrible shape they arrived in. Returning.
1.0,It  doesn't even look like a crystal in the middle. Dull doesn't shine. And I am sad to say that I bought 3 different versions of it.
1.0,"I took this outfit out of the bag & immediately placed it back in the bag to return.  It's shiny, flimsy & cheap! There was white lint on the back of the pants (pilling). Which means, it has the potential to look like this all over after a few wears.  I think it was worn & sent back. The outfit is unacceptable, in my opinion."
1.0,The dress was too big and the seam was coming apart in one area so I returned it.
1.0,I couldn’t see any difference.  Not worth the money!!
1.0,I have had this for a month now. Something is dysfunctional with the watch band and I thought I would be able to break it in but it doesn’t appear so. If I twist my hand it comes undone. It has to do with the latch mechanism. Pretty frustrating because I love the look of the actual watch
1.0,The 3T will never fit my nephew. It’s a 2T size.
1.0,Looked absolutely nothing like the picture. The “khaki” color is a dull bright and the cardigan is very plain.
1.0,The pants are so cute however the pick up color off anything so if you have on a black t-shirt it will stain the pants. The scope the body well but you will only get 1 wear out of it
1.0,Did not stop my glasses from slipping at all. They don't stay on the glasses arm. Just awful and expensive for a piece of cloth. Don't buy. This doesn't deserve even one star.
1.0,Coke side of the connection leaks.<br />Seller will not take return.<br />Save your money and contact Coke for a connector.<br />THIS ONE IS A RIP OFF
1.0,I ordered this item thinking is knee length and it was short. I ordered small but it runs super small and it’s not fitting well
1.0,Sole came off shoe on edge first time I wore them and by the second time the front toe sole was completely peeled back. Didn't even bother with a refund and threw them straight in the trash.
1.0,Item is size for a doll. XL is really XS and then u have to pay to return this item.
1.0,Too large for my wife’s rist and doesn’t look like it’ll last long.
1.0,"Large imperfections in both, look like low grade plastic superglued on cheap metal..."
1.0,Just falling apart after one wear.
1.0,I was sent the wrong color. It did not look like the photo & the style was much different than expected
1.0,Shipped quickly but WAY TOO SMALL. I like my shirts baggy and thought an XL would do it. However it seems more like an XS. Cute shirt but just doesn't fit. Based on the picture it would seem like a large baggy shirt but it is also very short not midriff but almost. It's NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED!!! Save your money and just go to Walmart or Target.
1.0,Broke after only 2 weeks of normal wear
1.0,Very uncomfortable shoe. Waste of money
1.0,Horribly cheap. I felt like a thrift store figure skater.
1.0,Item was broken when it arrived.
1.0,"If you are buying a XXLarge and it looks like XXSmall, this is for you.  Did not return because of the hassle.  NOT happy.  Gave it to my granddaughter."
1.0,I was so excited when i ordered this bras. But guess what? It is plan useless.. i don't understand all the hype on the ads. I does not work. 1- it Made my perky chest flat. 2- uncomfortable. 3- you can tell through the clothes. I used it for 30 min and it ended it up in the trash.
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture.  Ring is super dull and has no detail to it at all.  None of the ""gems"" have the diamond cuts to them. It is absolutely a waste of money! I was not expecting perfect but I did expect to get what was advertised but instead I got a bubblegum trinket not worth 2cents."
1.0,This rain suit sucks! I've wore it 4 times for only a few hours total water leaks through the jacket the more than the pants
1.0,The sizes advertised are not as accurate for US. They run very small.
1.0,Soft but run incredibly small. I bought the rainforest paisley (same size and brand) and those fit perfect. These pinch the waist horribly and it choked my calves.
1.0,The clips don’t close completely. It’s cheap plastic.
1.0,runs extremely small. I ended up cutting up the shirt and using the lace and adding it to a jacket. I wear a large and the sleeves were extremely tight in this xl shirt. It pulled across the top as well.
1.0,"I held off reviewing them since I received these until I figured out what to do with them.  Still wrapped and in the box it came in.  They arrived with a partially treated lens to which you can see my eye on one side.  I am still disappointed even now...  everything was fine, but that.....  just, no."
1.0,"I will not recommend this socks at all. It slides into the shoe easily. I have tried it on different shoes, same problem. Bought a different brand and that one stays put. It is definitely a no show but it easily and quickly slides under your foot before you take the 20th step."
1.0,Disappointed in the fit and fabric.
1.0,Part for stopper broke easily
1.0,They didn't send me a battery I'm my watch. I can't get the back open either. 😩
1.0,Currently disappointed. I ordered this for my grandsons birthday.  It was to be there Saturday and now it will be Wednesday.
1.0,You should order two sizes larger than you normally wear
1.0,nice good looking but stopped working after 3 days<br />I wanted to return it but could not find the box
1.0,Can't be used as is lens is stamped
1.0,They are like Halloween costume material.. I love high waisted but these are extremely too high waisted and still have a saggy crotch.
1.0,"Shirt was poorly made. The hem on bottom was flipping up on shirt where the lace meets and is cut straight across compared to the picture,when lace was going upward in the middle.Was not pleased. False advertisement."
1.0,Never again... Horrible fit.
1.0,"Did not like it , wore them one day and the ring turn, the gold turn brown and I threw them away"
1.0,Cheaply made. Compass doesn't work. In the picture you can see they are not pointing the same direction. They are also pointing South...
1.0,"I ordered two pairs of these reading glasses, while the frames are great, nice and lightweight, the lenses are terrible. I ordered two pairs, first pair came with very scratched lenses, I sent those back and was sent a replacement pair, same thing - very scratched lenses. You’d be better off getting a pair from the drug store."
1.0,Junk!  Metal rings at lace up are already brown and rusting and bleeding the rust onto the fabric. And he’s only had them 1 week!
1.0,"This shirt looked NOTHING like the photo!  The graphics are not even printed straight on the shirt!  Also, sizing ran insanely small.  Overall quality was terrible."
1.0,Fail.  Buckle appears magnetic so you can't use the compass on your wrist.  You have to take it off and make sure the buckle doesn't touch it
1.0,1/2 the red is already off the snap.
1.0,This is much more thick than they advertise. Buyer beware.
1.0,"The item is not as described, the sizing was completely incorrect.  I ordered ""Tag 3XL ---- Recommended Height: 135-145cm---Recommended Weight: 30-35kg---Recommended Age 10-12 years"" for my son who is a thin, 132cm tall.  It would fit a child half his size and age.  The seller will not offer me a full refund (offered less than half of what I paid) and told me it is not a free refund, even though it says it in the description.  DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,Poor quality! Started to fray with second use.
1.0,The waist was too low and I didn't like the fit at all. It's not the same as the picture shows.
1.0,It turned brown
1.0,"Not worth the hassle of a return but this keyring is bunk. It doesn't really function any different than any other keyring, it's sharper and more abrasive on your hands. It's also slightly smaller than a regular key ring which was another disappointment. Mine came with two rings one titanium and one tiny small metal one but not the clip like advertised."
1.0,"Very disappointed.  The top does not have an elastic underlayer so if you bend over or a wind catches it and lifts it, whatever you have on underneath will be seen"
1.0,"I had really high hope for these glasses, but within a few short months the arm broke off. I contacted Amazon for an exchange and they only offer in 30 days, so dont waste your money. They are very true to the image in terms of color but quality is not there."
1.0,The earrings dont fit in ur ear.
1.0,"I like the, but the pants are really big."
1.0,"Stiff fabric, even after washing.  Cheaply made."
1.0,Top received not what was shown - Too large - kinda blame part of the reviews that I read - Not a happy camper
1.0,"😵Made cheaply, HUGE and stretched out(must be made for alien faces👽, not human faces, lol)."
1.0,"I should of know but I couldn’t tell if it was Chinese worthless material before I I bought them but sure enough it was more worthless Chinese garb. The threads are already coming undone, the the body fit was loose what a loss!"
1.0,"SO disappointed with this.  I think it's beautiful and was very excited for it to arrive.  Any other top like this that I've seen, they are loose and flowy and fit a variety of sizes.  This one is very tiny.  Maybe if you are a skinny 14 year old it might fit.  Most definitely a size small.  I had to return it.  I had been planning to order several of the other tops pictured but I'm really glad I waited as obviously this company makes clothing for teenage girls and not grown women."
1.0,Had to give it away. I normally wear 3x but didn't know I had to choose 5x in this blouse. So disappointed. Won't be buying anymore.
1.0,Even the CL GOWN was too small which usually fits me
1.0,this  item horrible thin material runs way too small
1.0,"These aren't actual jeans and they're a very cheap material. They are very thin and a very cheap material, they will likely rip in a few uses. They are also very oddly fitting on me, too short and too big at the top. The seller contacted me to tell me these were actually leggings, so they're falsely advertising what they sell. These are not jeans, like they are advertised as.<br /><br />The seller actually contacted me and offered to give me a full refund if I would change my review. Very sketchy behavior, so be careful of these so called 5 star reviews for these things."
1.0,The material looks nothing like the picture. I do not like the feel or the fit.
1.0,I received 23 OCT and they were perfect. 29 OCT they fell apart. Too bad. I loved them for a week and now thy are garbage. See pics.
1.0,Not a sweatpants.<br />Material not great felt hard
1.0,Poor quality overall
1.0,Weird fit. Not pleased.
1.0,It's cute but cheap. Wore it 2 days and it broke.
1.0,"I ordered an xl for my very small 9 year old. They arrived with holes and by the look of them, they won't last a wash. I also received a small that is probably a perfect size for a 6 month old."
1.0,"Don’t buy this product, I through them away after received."
1.0,It feels like plastic coated in cheap colored foil. Horrible quality.
1.0,"The bra itself was so darling, but very poorly made. It essentially fell apart the first time I wore it. So sad because I did like it. Bummed I spent the money to only wear it once..."
1.0,Ordered usual size my son wears. The sweater was a big disappointment . It is about 4 to5 sizes too small. The packaging also states it is 4x. All wrong. Only gave a star because nice material and made up nice. Would have been a perfect sweater if size was forrect
1.0,"so this would have been a great dress except for the lining!  So the dress has 2 linings, which it needs but unfortunately the dress maker saved a couple cents and made the 1 lining extremely short, just below your butt.  So when you stand in the light or sun you see the very short lining which makes it look ridiculous"
1.0,"Feels like plastic, kids costume jewellery. Stones looked plastic as well. Even for the low price, this one is a dud."
1.0,Did not like the way this item fit  but otherwise ok
1.0,Came cracked. Will be sending back.
1.0,While the hat is a nice quality the electronics seem to be garbage. It's finally cold so I charged it up and wore it for one day. Plug it in to charge again and it does not charge. Completely dead and useless.
1.0,The dress was smaller than expected
1.0,"Terrible. They smell, they tear easily, they appear to have disintegrated during delivery, which took forever."
1.0,I ordered this product following the advice from the size chart. Completely inaccurate. Way to big for me. I need the regular size L. I have no way to contact the seller for replacement.
1.0,I absolutely loved this bracelet - for the two weeks I had it.  It broke apart and I don't think it can be fixed.  Very unhappy!
1.0,"Ordered a size bigger so it wouldnt cling as much, and it was waaay too tight. I ordered a 2xl and my sister who is a medium said it fit her perfectly"
1.0,Order this product to excel it did not fit it was a very cheaply made not even close to anything that my husband or son would have worn. They did very good on the return though so I was surprised
1.0,"The edges are unfinished so it cuts into your face. The shipping was poor I received mine in a plastic mailer and it was crunched, spent a day trying to glue it back together"
1.0,"I could not figure out how to use this. The you tube video looked super easy. I watched the video multiple times, but still couldn't figure it out on my own head."
1.0,Stupid cheap made and way to small.
1.0,I did not like this watch! because this is fastest watch in the world! 5 min per 1 hour goes forward!
1.0,"Well, I normally wear a size 8 (US) so based on the reviews stating that it ran very small I ordered an XL.  The reviews were correct BUT this is no way an XL.  My husband and I laughed when I tried it on!  It fit more like an XS.  The bust measures 26&#34; around and the waist measures 22&#34;.  So, beware it definitely runs really small!  This dress is going back ASAP!  LOL!!!"
1.0,Stretched out after wearing once!
1.0,Too small 😔 How do I return??
1.0,Don't buy the cheap Chinese band if you own the galaxy watch 4!<br />Took 3 weeks to get here for NO PROPER FIT!<br />DO NOT BUY
1.0,Sized for toddlers. I'm 5'5 130 and it barely covered my boobs.
1.0,They were horrible the legs of the glasses were loose. Second day they broke
1.0,The bra didn't stick.  I had to keep pulling top part up. Embarrassing at a baby shower. It was also cold weather no sweating.
1.0,The material is not jean material.  It's very light paperweight.  I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Was excited to get this jacket but was quickly disappointed in the fit and quality. The size large - which I typically wear could have easily been a 3XL with another company. I decided not to exchange because the zipper jammed and got stuck when first trying it on.
1.0,My initial impression was this was a good bargain for the price but i have since realized that it is not. The children have only played with these items three times and they have already started to fall part. The scarfs have loose strings that are causing them to shed apart and the ribbion are doing the same.. They will be returned for a refund if possible.
1.0,horrible<br />Rolls off hands<br />Sticks to everything
1.0,Dress feels and looks cheap in person.I has itchy material and has an uncomfortable fit. I'll be returning this dress shortly.
1.0,"No thick girl could ever fit in this, the product photo is very misleading. The XL I ordered fit like a medium. The only person who could wear this was a male friend who normally wears a size S in men's clothing, and he looked like a baby in his playsuit, lol.  The S I bought for my other friend so we could match fits like it was for maybe an 8 year old child."
1.0,I know I ordered one with moon pattern<br />That’s why I ordered<br />It came solid black<br />Fit is good but definitely not the one I chose when ordering
1.0,"Looks all stretched out..ordered small..<br />can't describe fitting, just hangs sloppy"
1.0,So upset I order this with the intent to wear it the next day and it showed up completely broken and looks like it was not put together properly. Straps were not attached to the dress…. So disappointed… going to return and hope the next one comes back not broken
1.0,"So I got this item one because my daughter had one of a different style and two due to the cool lights since we all need to wear a mask now. Well, for one, the light doesn't stay on more than 10mins.  It shuts off when changing the color to the flickering lights. I really didn't want to return it with chances they may try to resale it which is scary with covid. But this product it's made well. You can't hardly breath through it.  I tried to wear another mask under it due it not being able to wash properly,  but that wasn't successful.<br />I wouldn't recommend buying this particular one. If you can find another brand with a full mouth and nose covering and piece to turn on lights in the inside and not sticking out, then good. But wasn't worth the money paid."
1.0,Very large in size material to stiff
1.0,"Well, i like it but only one snap worked. I recommend sellers to check it out so carefully before selling something. You have to do things right or you just do nothing."
1.0,Fell apart first use - what a disaster....had to go buy new on trip
1.0,"Huge waste of money. These are so cute and comfy, but the pins they come with are simply too short and they fall out easily. The very first day I wore them, the band fell apart multiple times and by the second day, the pin was bent. Robbed a pin from the other included bands and it too lasted less than 24 hours. I wasn't doing anything wild, either, this mostly came from putting my coat on and taking it off. Absolutely not worth your time, unfortunately."
1.0,"Dress measurements weren’t even close to what we sent. We had really high hopes for this dress. My daughter is very small, wears Sz 00, so custom measurements were a must. The dress arrived and it’s very pretty and high quality, but it it just didn’t match measurements we sent. Seller did not offer to remake the dress and returning was not easy and I had to pay to return it. Disappointed"
1.0,Had to return no true to size fit. Way too small
1.0,What colors on the watch weren’t very appealing. I thought they look better in the photos that in person
1.0,"cheep leather, small and does't hold much"
1.0,Was so excited to get this and it doesn't fit. So disappointed
1.0,Broke before I was able to try it on! Weak clasps.
1.0,Bought two.  Cheap fabric.  Defective zipper.
1.0,This item was supposed to be long sleeved floor length.  It was label as such in the packaging but when I opened the clear bag it was a mini dress with cutout shoulders.  Went back immediately!
1.0,"Completely disappointed and can no longer return. Would like to shop with the vendor again, but will not purchase this again. Would like a refund. Very poorly stitched together."
1.0,PRO: Size true to description.<br />CONS: Color more orange than in photo.  Serious quality issues (stitching crooked & unraveling).  Plastic sticking out from behind stitching (see photos)!  Had to return.
1.0,Bad quality! Don't buy
1.0,"Clip missing,hole at top, plastic exposed, Total piece of junk."
1.0,"I got this for my daughter as a Christmas present.  She picked it out and was quite excited. When it arrived, I allowed her to open it right away as an early Christmas present.  She was so happy and excited. Her excitement quickly turned to disappointment!<br /><br /> First of all there was supposed to be twenty and there was only twelve.  There were supposed to be a wide variety and there were only a few different styles.  They really are unwearable.  Either too big or two small.  They are really cheap, as others have stated, they are basically Barbie necklaces.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I'm missing half.  The ones they did send are basically all the same, no variety at all.  They aren't even wearable  because of the way they are made. I think she is able to maybe wear 2 but probably not.  That's ridiculous when I Paid for twenty.<br /><br />What's worse is my daughter's disappointment.  She waited everyday for the mail to come.  When this arrived she was so excited until she realized how horrible the product is.<br /><br />I would never recommend this product to anyone. Very disappointed!"
1.0,did not have American flag o9n it like it claim when I ordered it
1.0,"When i press the buttom all it does is make a very slight static sound, no lights turn on either. I was looking forward to this but it just doesnt work so no i have to go through the trouble of returning it. But it came earlier than expected so i mean...there's that"
1.0,"I wanted this to be cute, but I really didn't like it. The fabric also changes from the dress shirt material to a ribbed material."
1.0,This hoodie sucks so not buy!!
1.0,"My granddaughter was delighted with her Christmas present. I saw her a couple days later, I asked her where's your bracelet,, I lost it.. I didn't even feel it when it broke.<br />And it's not expensive but cheaply made.Sorry no more."
1.0,"I'm am not a bigger size person, but I mean that fit is for a doll! Wayyy to small"
1.0,Skirt defective
1.0,"It looked nothing like the picture! The silver veins were not on top of the green, but underneath, and not noticeably silver-colored. And it looked cheap. I would not buy jewelry from this seller again! I was really frustrated, because I wanted to buy an elven leaf and not spend $90 on it. Aggravating!"
1.0,Does not quite look or hang as nice as it does on the model.  The sleeves and the neckline are trimmed with little tan pom poms.  Definitely doe not<br />look right on this dress.
1.0,My son thought the masks were a little too big compared to his other kids sized masks.
1.0,The rings are extremely thin and have a dull gray finish.  They are thinner than a paper clip with a duller finish.  My daughter did not find the rings attractive but it was also not worth the trouble to return.
1.0,These were so cheap! Next time I’ll spend more money.
1.0,The printed skull face is a lot bigger than my face. ( I'm 6-3 195lbs. ) Also skull is printed on both front and back. Looks dumb from behind. The pictures are misleading.
1.0,Heard back from the recipient of this gift. Broke first day.
1.0,I was very disappointed in the color and the fact they were made of soft fake leather fabric.
1.0,Needs more of an arch and support. One side was too tight
1.0,Terrible. There was strong hanging from everywhere when I got it. I ordered a large which is usually on the bigger/baggies side for me and I could baraley put this shirt on. After wearing it twice the seems started to fall apart. Save your money
1.0,Fogged over.
1.0,Dress is smaller than solid colors purchased before. Fabric is stiff with no stretch. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,I ordered an XL when I’m typically a large or XL but the “XL” I received was more like a medium
1.0,Me queda grande me enviaron un numero que no es
1.0,Too small for a man...  More like a boy or teen
1.0,The pants are way too large.. Even on a tall woman it goes down to the floor. Too thin. You can see the outline of your underwear and then some.
1.0,Their XL size was too small on me and too tight on me. Never buying their shirts again.
1.0,"Not s good product, the idea was great, the executionvery poor, the bag tips over, wheels too weak to support the bag<br />Shortly, it was a mistake to purchase the bag, it's awful and pricy for the quality.<br />Would not recommend to buy"
1.0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!!!!!! Do not buy!!!! I won't give even one star- but had to give one in order to post it. It doesn't look like on the picture. The fabric is horrible and shiny. Don't ever buy anything from China. The return will cost me more than this shirt."
1.0,"The dress is nice and the fabrik is nice too. However, the dress has white marks in the front and in the back that are not stain."
1.0,"Product incorrectly depicted on Amazon using a standard size water bottle but that is not the case.  No bottle is provided or at least a recommendation of the correct size bottles available at retail.  Also, there was no charging cord included with the product so you must have your own otherwise your SOL."
1.0,Falls apart almost instantly.
1.0,"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and size small fits me. I couldn't keep this dress on for more than 2 minutes, because I started itching. The fabric feels cheap and scratchy. I thought this dress was going to be cotton but it is 95% polyester. Also, the neck area is very narrow and feels tight. I don't like this dress at all."
1.0,Really disappointed with this item. It wasn't anything like the picture. It's to small and very short. I hate I wasted my money.
1.0,"I was so excited to wear this dress as i love the vintage style and shape seen in the pictures, but when it arrived, I was disappointed. The material is thin and lifeless, a very shiny, cheap-looking synthetic. The waistline just hangs there. The sleeves are loose and saggy. I have been very lucky with finding great dresses on Amazon in the past, but this dress fell well below my expectations considering it was $40. I am 5’7” 162 lbs and my measurements are 36-30-39. I usually wear a medium top and large bottom, or 8/10, sometimes even 12 depending on the manufacturer, and I purchased a large. Unfortunately, I have to return it."
1.0,Wouldn't recommend
1.0,Poor quality would not buy this item again
1.0,too small to fit most containers
1.0,Cut funny
1.0,Sized way too small. 2xl fit like a large
1.0,"Bought this for my wife's birthday. When it came in it was so small I thought it must be for a child. I went back to the add and it stated then that it was 1.2 inches long now it says its over 4"" long. with a disclaimer at the bottom that measurement error is permissible in small print. The product was only 1/2"" long barley covering the lob of the ear. I gave it to my wife anyway and of course she loved it. Have only seen her wear it that day. Don't be fooled buy this seller as I was. I will not buy from them again."
1.0,Did not receive red earrings
1.0,Makes me sweat. Tress turns wet in airconditioner.
1.0,These riding tights run about 3 sizes smaller than the tag. I felt like a stuffed sausage.
1.0,Terrible poor quality
1.0,These are too small for an adult face.
1.0,Item was not as pictured. Seashells should have been purple n shiney but mine was black and weird. I ordered an xlg but I fits like a medium. Fabric is extremely thin.
1.0,Was a gift.  Very poor quality.  Sent it back!
1.0,I love this bathing suit. It's adorable! however the bottoms came with one of those sanitary sticky pads.... And when I pulled it off it left such a residue that there is no way that I could wear it. I have contacted the seller 3 × to see how to get this off so that it is wearable.  I did not want to worship and then have it be unreturnable. They have yet to respond to me
1.0,"Close to impossible to remove links. Jeweler would not touch it due to the high possibility of the components breaking. Learned a lesson...if it is too cheap to believe, it is too cheap"
1.0,"I ordered a size up, based on the reviews, but I was literally swimming in it.  I put it on and it fell off me.  The logo on the front is way darker thwn depicted.. couldn't even tell it was a cat.  Also the model shows the shirt to be long--I wanted to wear it with leggings, but it fits more like a crop top.  So disappointed, I'm in the process of returning it. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I was a bit disappointed because I always liked the merchants products,,the quality of the product scares me,cos a couple of the bails were broken when I got them,so now I'm not sure if I would use it ,because it might break when I assemble the clay in it.will read reviews next time...."
1.0,It doesn't look good... it's looks like fake prints
1.0,They broke after wearing them a few times.<br />Glad they are returnable. All I did was open them and it came right off. Just snapped.<br />They were cute.
1.0,Super thin. The image makes it look like it’s a good coat but really it’s a jacket. Probably best for midwestern states or other areas that don’t really get a snowy winter. Okay for fall I guess.
1.0,Bag still alls like dead fish!! I have no packaging to return the profivr'
1.0,"Close are too small ordered several styles and ordered them 2 sizes bigger and they were still to small. Please pick another company to purchase from. Ridiculous time I have wasted and wasn't able to wear it at the occasion I wanted, very sad."
1.0,It’s only been 3 weeks of having this band and it’s already fading off
1.0,"I never received my order. Don’t get this if you don’t want to be scammed lol. Ordered back in late July or early august and it’s already October, so to sum it up this is very much a scam. Oh one last thing is that when it was the “arriving day”, I never got it. Order disappears from my ‘orders’ on Amazon with the code to track shipping, and is just not to be seen anywhere except right now when I was scrolling down my page. Very disappointed, but this is cheap so what do you expect tbh."
1.0,"too small, won't bother returning it because it's chinese junk to begin with."
1.0,"Please do not buy from this seller, as this product I purchased turned colors after 2 months."
1.0,Waaaaaaay too small. Like not even close
1.0,"gift to for my sister - it was broken, she never even got to wear it once so I will see if I can fix it or make a better necklace out of it. lucky I do bead work. I most like likely will never buy again and tell people not to buy unless you like to fix stuff regularly. I would have given a 0. but not an option."
1.0,"Not a huge fan at all. The material is not soft at all, pretty rough actually. And they're very see through. These definitely aren't leggings to wear without a long shirt."
1.0,"Love the shirt design and the quality of the material is great, but an extra large is still the size for a skinny teenager."
1.0,"You can see from the photo that around the hip, the top was uneven. It was as if it was off center but one side even came up higher on my hips. But, customer service was great in issuing a refund for it when I reported the issue."
1.0,It is poorly sewn. It is not straight back
1.0,looks and feel good
1.0,Too wide for me wish the dimensions were noted in details section.
1.0,This thing is shapeless and huge. Not flattering at all. Very much like a potato sack.
1.0,"The quality of the product was excellent, BUT when I put in the search category for petite jumpsuits for women this product came up.  I'm 5'3, weight approx. 135 but I'm broad shouldered so I always get a large because of that reason otherwise they are too tight when I reach up to do anything.  But being that I am so short, the crotch of the jumpsuit hangs down really low AND is AT LEAST 3 inches too long!  Being as my husband threw away the box and the packaging I'm stuck with 2 jumpsuits (I got the red and the black) that I can't wear or get altered to fit me.  If you are 5'4 or under.....don't purchase this product!  I will say that if the company wanted to create these in PETITE sizes, I would buy them in every color they make!"
1.0,"This shirt is thick, huge, and overall unattractive."
1.0,This is not a child's hat 😔. It is way too big for a child.
1.0,Trust the other reviews. Stayed set of 6 in the title. Only received one. The lenses were already popped out of the frame. Very cheap and false advertising on quantity and quality.
1.0,"They were took forever to arrive (from China). I would not put these on a newborn. They are Long socks. The horns are not sewn in the right spot on one of them so you can’t even tell what it’s supposed to be. They are soft, but I suspect that they are not going to make it through one wash cycle intact. Disappointed"
1.0,"This is a really cool bracelet and my son loved the look of it, but the snap do not stay closed so it is constantly falling off."
1.0,"I haven't even worn them. One earring will ""click"" together, but the other won't click, and just falls right back out of my ear. I'm returning them."
1.0,"The larger Huggies broke after a few wears. They looked very pretty on, but the clip won’t click to close."
1.0,Very misshaped. They are awkward and deformed
1.0,This coat was ordered in 18month but different color and showed up so big that it fits my 3 year old who is in 4T clothing. The material right out of the package is fraying. Would not suggest this coat for quality or sizing especially considering it’s expected fit is 100%!
1.0,"The color of these jeans is totally different than the picture looked, they are not 32 inches in inseam, and now I have to pay to return them. Not impressed, would not buy Mavi jeans online again. Return policy is very vague when you order - it just says they are returnable but doesn't specify that you have to pay shipping on returns (even when item is misrepresented)."
1.0,Dress is super cute except the top part definitely teal and white and the bottom is blue
1.0,Inferior quality!
1.0,They fall apart and DO Not stay closed super cheap and would Never buy again
1.0,"I gave them as a gift to my mother in law, they broke within the first hour. Did not expect much for ten bucks but expected more than an hour"
1.0,If bigger in the chest I wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,"Image on front of sweatshirt washed off at first wash, no resolution from seller, only two responses then no contact"
1.0,Broke first day he played in the
1.0,"Well, the product is exactly as in the pictures, got it fast but however did use it once and my nails were sore and weak after use it, Still growing and breaking easily, I used it the way recommended in the manual.  Would not recommend this product."
1.0,"Very cute bracelet for someone with a small wrist.  I have small wrist for an adult and i had trouble getting it on, but i had bought it for a friend's daughter who is a bit bigger than me...it will never fit her wriste.  Alsodid not like that a &#34;ChubbyChico&#34;charm was also attached to the wire which you don't see on the picture."
1.0,Ring was nice but not centered on ring mount. Sending it back!
1.0,This shirt size XL would fit a small kid-not an adult. I do not recommend.
1.0,One day in the sea and it will be total without color...Not bronze
1.0,The fabric is worse than a rag on first wash!! Looked good until i washed it<br />So disappointed and these pants are not cheap! Why are the charging so much for such cheap fabric quality?
1.0,So the idea of the belt ratchet is awesome except this one doesn't pull it off. It doesn't stay tight.  As soon as I pull it tight and ratchet it tight and walk two steps it unlatches it and the belt loosens. This belt buckle sucks!
1.0,"Very comfortable but after only 2 washes, the seam on the right leg busted open. Not well stitched at all to be for a “bigger girl” in a “bigger size”."
1.0,"Writings are too small. If you like to decorate your babies house, you may buy this one. Picture are so disproportionate! Disappointed with this product. It’s a return!!"
1.0,"let me just start off by mentioning that this is my SECOND dress as I had to buy a replacement after the first ones zipper completely broke. now that I have my replacement after taking a whole week to get here despite me receiving my first dress in 2-3 days and it now being the day before halloween....the zipper will not zip. me and my mother stood there for 30 mins trying to zip it and it just would not. do yourself a favor and don't waste ur money on this, the sellers are of no help and never responded to me either.  so incredibly upset, its the day before halloween and my costume is ruined due to a cheap zipper lol"
1.0,I’ve had this wallet for less than a month. It is already broke on the zipper. I’m very disappointed that I’ve hardly used it and it’s already broken
1.0,this is made of a very thin low quality t shirt fabric it is NOT a real sweatshirt its also too short and very boxy/unflattering not really worth it especially when you have to pay to return ship
1.0,The material was cheap and heavy. It did not compliment me at all.
1.0,"I’m convinced this products target audience was aimed for people with small noses. I purchased this product to use as a hoop nose ring and it’s literally so small can’t fit into my nose, and my nose is honestly pretty big. It seems as if the hoops are for women with cute small noses, but if you have a big thick nose I would not recommend it. The studs are pretty, but it’s all just super small like they can go in a toddlers ear"
1.0,"This product should get no stars. It was delivered with a broken pin, and a second pin broke a few hours later. Do not waste your money.  Find another band!"
1.0,No vienen los 2 solo me llego uno
1.0,The lacquer was not cured. The imprint of my shirt in on the pendant. All luster is gone.
1.0,"Seller only listed the EXTENDED Waist measurement without showing the waist relaxed measurement.  That mean the waist may be too tight if you don't stretch out the pant elastic.  For someone like me who has problem with tight waist band which caused stomach discomfort and acid reflex.  Size XL show 31"" but actually relaxed at 28 the max.  Have to return."
1.0,Impossible to breath in it
1.0,Earrings are not as pictured. Very short<br />stud. Can’t get them in my ear. Extremely disappointed!
1.0,These rings look beautiful but after one week of wearing it the color becomes copperish and therefore unwearable.  DO NOT BUY
1.0,This was a gift and I've not heard from the recipient.  Give it a chance!
1.0,Fell apart within the fist day.
1.0,"Bought this for me and my boyfriend and he loved it. But it lasted only a month and it fell off the key ring, so there goes 6 dollars. Very disappointing"
1.0,"Very poor quality, dials pretty loose when adjusting time."
1.0,Shirt is made of cheap material feels like felt.
1.0,"Really good product for ONE TIME USE. Thread started coming out after first use. Washed it, took it out and all of thread had come out tangled with a dress shirt. Didn't even last a week. Very disappointed"
1.0,"Purchased shirt,  when it arrived it was OK.  After washing in cold water sleeves became incredibly tight and deformed.  If they are selling seconds, they need to indicate so."
1.0,Expected back in February after ordering in december. It's now mid April and I haven't gotten the original pair or the 2nd pair they supposedly sent out. Disappointing. They look cute.
1.0,"I wear a US size M. I ordered XL according to size guidance, but it is way too large. M would have been fine. However, I am not reordering as it is shapeless, and poor quality material."
1.0,"Doesn't exactly look like the display picture. I am kinda disappointed, I thought it was more of a white marble background. Instead it's lightly splattered paint."
1.0,"Dress is not like it looks at all, I threw the dress away. Waste of money"
1.0,"This item is not good, the parts won't keep in a single peace, they keep falling apart."
1.0,This came bent and it wasn't great quality. Very disappointed because the picture of the hat is just what I was looking for.
1.0,I ordered large to have it baggy. It fit small like my normal shirts. I kept it. It is two to three sizes off. Be warned.
1.0,Cheaply made. The posts broke.
1.0,The shoes are almost impossible to charge and the lights only work for about an hour after they are charged.
1.0,"Small,  espically if your calf's or legs are on the athletic side. Do not stay up well. Fall down often by the knee. Would look at some other procduct in the future."
1.0,"Nice pjs, but the sizes were so far off. Way too small. I had to return all I ordered."
1.0,Who tf has a nose this small? It’s like they’re made for a baby’s septum. DONT BUY
1.0,I was very happy with this dress...until I cleaned it.  I followed the care instructions but it shrank significantly and is no longer appropriate to wear to work.
1.0,They do not bend to fit on your ear. Only one set does. So none of them stay on except two.
1.0,It’s not proportionate to my body and I’ve had a few friends try them. They are high-rise and I wear low-rise. Just not for us. Doesn’t look like the photo... the color is different for sure.
1.0,Lo devolví por que compré 2 por equivocación y nunca me reembolsaron el 💵
1.0,These DO NOT fit the 38mm apple watches and I ordered two of them.  Now I have to take the time to go and return them to get my money back for something I ordered properly but was not accurately described.  These reviews are correct when they say they do not fit.
1.0,Returned gloves immediately. They were very ugly. And way too big. Horrible
1.0,Neither sizing neither quality. Returned
1.0,Do not waste your money. Idea great if the strapless bra actually 'stuck' after 3 wearings. but the edges stop holding after meticulously following care instructions. I am also a small B cup woman weight and size is normal. Very disappointed. I hate bra's and the squeeze of straps etc.
1.0,"Oh man, this was a hard no and not at all what I was expecting. The material is super cheap looking and feeling, the orange color is not accurate- it’s a lighter/more pastel than the rustic orange pictured. The bodice is like those weird puffy shirts from the 90s that expanded when you put it on- not attractive on this dress!"
1.0,This is the worst belt I ever had.<br />I could not get the stupid thing to release while wearing it and after 45 minutes I gave up and cut<br />the thing so I could get undressed
1.0,"The quality of the nose piece is a large concern.  Based on the product I received, I fear they will break after a few uses."
1.0,"This watch band is unusable. The hole that the pin inserts into is not large enough to insert the pin. With no way of inserting a pin, the watch band is unusable. Because of the low price of the band, it's not worth even sending back for a refund. I don't know know<br />How the seller can allow this band out the door without first checking if the band is even usable. This band is not."
1.0,The material smelled like a skunk!
1.0,"worst purchase I have ever made on amazon leather smelled like mothballs tried to get smell out,  no way!<br /> just awful! don't waste your money!  Threw the piece of junk away!!"
1.0,The picture doesn't measure up to what I received. This dress is awful
1.0,The dress runs small and is horrible quality. Almost the same kind of materials kids costumes are made out of. Don’t bother.
1.0,"Way too stiff and narrow. My son wears a 7, I got him an 8 and it takes a couple minutes just to get ONE on! (And that's if I can even get it on in the first place)."
1.0,"it doesnt look how it does in the picture , its one long skinny strap that you are supposed to wrap around yourself rather then an adjustable clasp in the back  , i usually use it in other ways since it wont wrap over my waist properly . material is good & the metal circle is smaller then depicted & chains dont look how they do in the picture but i still appreciate them because they are removable so i like to use them on other pieces or attach them to collars im wearing lol"
1.0,It ripped on second wear.
1.0,Very poorly sewn
1.0,Broken item!!!!!!!!!!!!! wasted time :(
1.0,This has got to be the most tacky thing I have ever seen .. Very cheap looking ..<br />Was going to return but decided not to waste my money on postage.
1.0,Parece blusa... se ven los gluteos
1.0,The rope on it is very long and it doesn't have a good way to secure it closed. one end has a bead and the other end has an open (twice the size of the bead) that doesn't have a slip not or anything. Very cheasy! My son refuses to wear it as I tried to tie a permanent knot which looks like a big clumped mess...not happy
1.0,Makes my skin itch
1.0,"Garbage, don't even bother buying it. It looks cheap and it probably is cheap. It is very bulky and does not hold more than one card. Keep your money and do not spend it on this product."
1.0,It’s not the same color as pic and the size runs small so if you are a medium try a large and don’t expect good quality it feels cheap. I’m so sad the color I got is ugly not that pretty color showed on pic at all
1.0,"A baggy, saggy mess.  Usually a 14/16, but XL waaaaaaay too big."
1.0,These are not compression tank tops
1.0,"Hat fits kids size head not for adults, Logo is falling off."
1.0,Cute but arms too small
1.0,Super small fit with cheap synthetic fabric. May be nice for a small kid.
1.0,I ordered large but the arm part didn't fit me properly.
1.0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. IT IS A COMPLETE RIP-OFF. THE WEBSITE KEEPS TRYING TO SELL YOU MORE AS YOU TRY TO CHECK OUT. THE MORE THEY SELL YOU THE MORE THEY MAKE IN SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES $7.95 PER ITEM. THIS FEES ARE NOT REFUNDABLE. GREAT WAY TO MAKE MONEY SINCE YOU WILL WANT TO RETURN EVERYTING 11111
1.0,They look cute.  But are way too small and didn't have much give to stretch.  My 3 year will not wear them this tight on his ears.  They also did NOT have any type of lining in the inside so they weren't soft.  I would have sent them back but my dog ate one.
1.0,Is not true to size I ordered a large thinking it would fit perfectly because I usually wear a medium but I didn’t want it to be snug so I ordered the large but it was still snug.
1.0,This is not for the modest. If you're super confident in being half naked go for it. I felt way to exposed. Maybe this could be for night gown or the beach or for a porn star.<br />* I received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review
1.0,"I ordered this in black and loved it enough to order a grey one in similar size. The website advertise the product as being sold by a company called Sweetnight. The black one arrived as advertised. The grey one, ordered from the same advertisement by Sweetnight  on Amazon, arrived with no manufacturing label inside the garment.  It was shipped by a seller called Nieiang and is made out of a much lesser quality material and much smaller in the arms than the black one. The size would be more like an XS than an L.  I received approval from the company to return the item but have to pay for the return shipping. I feel let down by Amazon for poor quality control, and the fact that I have to pay for shipping when they provided a bad product"
1.0,Tarnished after one wear beautiful piece but only good for what wear
1.0,I only got one so I have to send it back so I can get a set
1.0,"This slippers look nice but once you put your foot in them you can see why they are so cheap.  The criss-cross bands that hold your foot in are stretched out.  My toes literally dangle off the front when trying to walk in them.  After a couple days of wearing these my ankle started to hurt from having to use my toes to anchor the slipper down when walking.  I am extremely disappointed, please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money!!"
1.0,Nothing like the photo. Cheap
1.0,Cute but super thin and see through. For the price I expected a little better quality.
1.0,I loved the jumper but hate the way it’s cut it fit on the bottom but not on the top . Snaps won’t stay closed . A total waste of money for me
1.0,"I bought this based on the good reviews. This ships from overseas. The material is very flimsy and see through. I found 2 holes in the fabric by the waistline. It also looks like they tried to stitch another hole shut!  When I went to return, they sent me a label but did not pay for shipping. Buyer beware!"
1.0,"Hard ""No"" on this, I'm sorry to say. The design is nice, but the fabric is incredibly scratchy and it was unbearable to have on my skin. We tested on a second woman who took it off immediately and said, ""No"". Look elsewhere, as this is just not worth the scratching on the skin. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
1.0,"ITEM WAS WAY TOO SMALL AND IM A PLUS SIZE 2X AND I ORDERED A 3X ACCORDING TO MY SIZE. IT LOOKS LIKE A MEDIUM DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO SQUEEZE INTO, I CONTACTED THE COMPANY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU A REFUND WHEN YOU REQUEST THEY BELIEVE MORE IN LESS MAKE A DEAL"
1.0,I have to exchange this. What a disgust the colour is uneven. Cream and white. I don’t like it if it’s white it’s okay or full cream is okay. But it seems like short of the full white and was just patch with a cream
1.0,"Awkward fit, very very thin material. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,"ordered the one with flowers, the one that you have in the picture dakine Lori beanie and I received the one that I'm putting in the picture botanics. I think it's insane to send someone overseas something they didn't ask for. I think it's a scam and I'm never in buying again in amazon if it's gonna be like this."
1.0,Very unflattering. Returned it
1.0,Cheep cheep cheep
1.0,Donot buy they shrink 3 sizes when you wash them
1.0,Although I ordered the size base on my height and weight the belt loops were at the base of my ribs and the pockets were not at my sides but overlapping in the front. I returned this robe immediately marked as defective.
1.0,Horrible product doesn't hold at all. would not suggest purchase
1.0,Fit very snug and probably should size up for a comfortable fit.
1.0,Don’t. You won’t be able to put them on. Defeats the whole purpose.
1.0,Material was terrible.  I would never purchase from this particular place again.
1.0,The lettering is smudged at the bottom. Very disappointed that this would be shipped out to a paying customer. This is something you expect to find at a discount store. Over all the shirt is cute I just wish it didn’t look like we tried to make it in our basement.
1.0,I returned this dress. Very cheap and it's not even the same dress in the picture
1.0,Stitching is awful !!! Worn once and ripped !!!!
1.0,The chain broke the sec week we got it. My son was su bummed. Not worth the 15 I spent
1.0,The picture and the item at 2 different things. Completely different. Very poor quality. I never gonna wear it. Waste of money. Sorry but thats the true
1.0,Fit wasn't true
1.0,First of all it took FOREVER to arrive.  Who ever sized this 2 piece need to go back and check their measurements for (USA). The X-Large is not an X-Large it's more like and X-Small.  I was very disappointed.  I will no longer be ordering any clothing shipped from overseas.  smh
1.0,Xl is a 12 NOT A 16
1.0,As per description it seems durable and thicker but unfortunately it's not. It's quality is not good as expected and even after discount it seems expensive to me after paying around $6<br /><br />Really disappointed after receiving product
1.0,The clasp broke on the second day of wear
1.0,This is not embroidered and not a natural fiber.
1.0,Would have killed you to add a couple of more inches so that you could actually get them over your head without a struggle.<br /><br />Hope I can find the airpod it popped out of my ear.<br /><br />Would not buy again.
1.0,"Not strong, broke first day"
1.0,Am not that big is too bigggg😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩am 32
1.0,Poor quality. It broke in one week. Very disappointing.
1.0,cheap looking has to have small fingers size 6 7
1.0,Poor quality.  Difficult to open.  Handle broke off and material tore from metal spokes after first use.
1.0,These sandals are cute but do not fit well on my baby’s feet. The quality is not great and seem a bit cheap.
1.0,The material was cheap and not a great print
1.0,Fit was much smaller than expected. Material is very thin. And the description is misleading because none of the black tanks had a shelf bra. The white one was the only one with a shelf bra. I should have returned them but missed the deadline.
1.0,The sewing on this product is terrible.  It is uncomfortable around the collar and shoulders and I still haven’t figured out what is going on with the right sleeve.  You can feel it’s just not right.
1.0,Made all funky! Horrible made. Don’t waste your time or money. Returning
1.0,I wore this about 4 weeks everyday. Than it started to turn yellow and made my wrist dark.
1.0,this isn't made that well it hurts your arm and rubs wrong
1.0,"The PJS were of wonderful material at Kohls, wrapped and I had them delivered them to my sister in a her first<br />Care Center, celebrated her 88th birthday just recently, and received wonderful cards and gifts."
1.0,"Waited for a whole month and the entire time, they didn't send it cause it was an incorrect address (which it wasnt!) and didn't bother to tell me this until I contacted them near the end date. Meaning they weren't gonna give me a refund if I didn't ask. Thumbs down! Thanks for wasting my time losers!"
1.0,"I ordered in the gray color and loved it. Went back to order in the olive color. Arrived today, packaged inside out with a strap completely broken. Disappointed, as this color was more expensive."
1.0,Cheap low rent belt made poorly
1.0,The skirt was nice but it had an extremely strong gas-like smell coming from it.  I tried to let it air out but that didn’t work.  It would be mortifying to wear in public.  The whole room was filled with that unpleasant smell! I returned it obviously.
1.0,I was super excited about these bracelets. I bought them for my friends and I as friendship bracelets. Upon arrival they looked just like the pictures and I was satisfied with my purchase. Unfortunately after wearing it only 2 times the bracelet became tarnished and discolored. So disappointed.
1.0,"It stretches out very quickly and gives you no support to the stomach area, only to the rib area."
1.0,"Maybe I just got the one that slipped through quality control, but it was bad.  The tie shape wasn't symmetrical and the right side had a weird convex curve out that created a bell shape. Ultimately the very poor quality and craftsmanship of the tie is why it only earned one star (would give it 0 if I could). The whole thing was held together by ONE thread.  It was also loosely sewn on and you can see the photos to get a better understanding—the two parts of fabric are NOT held together at all! The strand was also undone at the bottom so there is essentially nothing holding it together and it is unwearable. The thread also does not match the yellow color and the olive thread can be seen in my photos poking out.<br /><br />Unwearble, horrible quality, was promptly returned."
1.0,"What attracted me to this skirt was its construction: very feminine with  flowing movement..,<br />It’s nothing like that!👎. Some people may like the fabric.  which is very wrinkled (I believe may always need ironing)👎<br />Its made 50% linen which I like,  but not for three layered pattern skirt like this.<br />  It’s not graceful👎. And he extra small layer of ruffles between me two layers,(only because of the fabric ) makes it look like, “ Little House on the Prairie skirt“<br />By the way I love Little House in the Prairie but that’s not the look I’m going for and NOT what the advertisement reflects.<br />  EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: I’m just INDER 4’11”<br />  Aprox 115 lbs.) almost all skirts are too long (which is not such a big deal because I’m ready for that I can shorten it if I like)<br />  This skirt does not touch the floor so for most people it might be too short?  Or maybe just right🤷🏻‍♀️👌just wanted to warn you🤗"
1.0,This hat looks nothing like it pictured!!!! Cap is completely soft and poorly made! It does not look anything like a baseball cap as pictured. Cap falls completely flat when not wearing it. False advertising.
1.0,"I'm disappointed in this item,  they rip in back after only wearing for three weeks."
1.0,Horrible. These leggings felt like paper and literally ripped when I put them on.  I will be returning these.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture..totally cheap quality
1.0,"These are made for tiny women. I am 5'8&#34;, 145 pounds, but these are for a much more petite woman, and are mis-labled as 1 size fits. I wear a size 6-8 dress and pants, just to give you an idea. These were not just a bit small, they were extremely small."
1.0,Too thin of a material and not fitting well
1.0,It broke right away /:
1.0,These shoes are a joke. They don't have rubber soles as it appears in the picture and they are CRAZY wide. It literally looks like it's a pair of shoes for a teddy bear. They are thin material and are cheaply made. My sons feet don't fit at all. Waste of my money! Stay away!
1.0,"I own many black long sleeve Nike shirts that I purchased at Nike.com. All of mine are black and medium. This is my 4th one. This one in a black medium did NOT fit like my other ones. The fit is different. It bunches. It's thin. I don't think is authentic Nike. I think it's fake. Why does this one fit different than all of my other nike's of the same size and color? I wanted to return it, but I didn't want to pay $7 to UPS to return it. I kept it, wore it once and that was a mistake."
1.0,Did not fully extend open on first use.
1.0,Arrived broken. Kinda makes it useless now
1.0,"I had purchased this years ago and it was awesome, this time the whole top unraveled on the second wear...."
1.0,JUST  Junk---came broken--emailed seller who was rude... I held on to it for some reason----but it has gone from a gold color to a rust  color---chain was never near water
1.0,"Poor quality control, or something. Collar was about 1.5 inches bigger than ordered, and the sleeves were about 2 inches longer. Used a body measurement tape and even compared with a Joseph Abboud. The shirt felt cheap too… felt more like cheap silk than cotton/cotton blend."
1.0,The material felt thin but i under estimated its warmth
1.0,It looks elegant however the clasp would not open.
1.0,Sent it back. Weird fit.
1.0,"Unfortunately these earrings Made my girlfriend break out. She has worn earrings from Claire's, hot topic, even holiday novelties from rite aid. These ones caused redness, irritation, and peeling."
1.0,"I tried on the right glove and the seam split! These were a gift from my wonderful husband and it is not easy to buy me presents. Me, I've read enough reviews of products shipped directly from China and I run away from purchasing said products. I just ckd- ya, I could mail these back, at the cost of over $20! Not many people will even look at buying these, so that means not many will read this review. My hope- the shipper/manufacture/all the people of China would grow a conscience. Not going to happen. OR Amazon could be more selective of the sellers they allow on their website-also not going to happen. I refuse to shop Walmart, not only for its tx of employees, but also after watching &#34;The High Cost of Low Prices&#34;. Is it possible Amazon starts to fall in to this category??? MINUS 5 stars for Amazon! This will fall on deaf ears, but I feel a tiny bit better."
1.0,When they arrived they were so cheap and gaudy looking that I just put them in a drawer. I will give them to a charity. A complete waste of money.
1.0,I wish I could give this a good review. Mine came without the sleeves. I look at all the pictures both from the product and other people's review as so the great little cap sleeves and then look at mine that has no sleeves it is missing those couple of inches of fabric that makes all the difference. The product title/ description says cap sleeve so where are my sleeves?
1.0,Way small  sizing terrible
1.0,Fits a toddler! If you have any curves at all don’t buy
1.0,"I dislike everything about this bra except the blue color. It has absolutely no support, is shapeless, a bit itchy and flattens out my beautiful breasts. I honestly hate it!"
1.0,Was not right size
1.0,Did not stay in your ears.. it is too long on one side and short term n the other
1.0,the insoles deteriorate and make them unwearable after just a few times of wearing them
1.0,This is NOT FUNNY!!!  This item needs to be removed. Nobody should be selling items with the word RETARDED any longer and no online business should be allowing it!
1.0,Never buy again
1.0,Forget Enimay.  They sent me the wrong size and then wanted me to pay to ship the stupid thing back.  Which costs more than the cheep belt in the first place.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,super cheaply made.  good reason the price is cheap.
1.0,Looks like a maturity dress on
1.0,"band is too short,"
1.0,It is made of some swimsuit like material and is hideous. Reminds me of a house dress but Asian style.
1.0,"I received the shirt that I ordered for my daughter very quickly and was super excited for her to open it. When she opened it she was absolutely stoked as Roman Reigns is her favorite wrestler!  When I looked at it the original tag for the shirt was cut out, this has me questioning the quality and the authenticity of the merchandise. I will be most likely sending it back."
1.0,The part of the key chain that says CRV won't fit on the key.  Either the key ring it too small or the key is too big.
1.0,It arrived broken...
1.0,"I received a shirt that states it is XXL. THERE IS NO WAY it is an XXL. If you need an XXL order a 4XL. Way too small. It is a good looking shirt, would be great for warm weather."
1.0,"Haven't had it six weeks and it has already broken.  Looks cute, poor quality material."
1.0,"These earrings are a transparent purple. They kind of disappear while wearing them. They don't stand out. Only the sticks stand out which means they don't look like lollipops, Just sticks in your ear."
1.0,"MUCH smaller than it appears on the listing.  If it wasn't so cheap, I would return it."
1.0,"When I ordered this wristband, I mistakenly took &#34;Authentic Tribal Leather...&#34; to mean that is was real leather, which it is not, it's alloy (fake) leather - looks & feels fake.  If I had paid closer attention to the details, I would have noticed where it actually says it's alloy leather.  Then, it's not even quite 8.5 inches long, it's just shy of that, and it's WAY too small to even close the clasp.  It's probably more suited for a child.  Unfortunately, it's not even worth the price of postage to return it for a refund, so it's straight to the trash - $9 bucks wasted, and a lesson learned."
1.0,"Was purchased for my twelve year old daughter. Received on December 8th but didn't wear until today, December 25th for approximately one hour. Developed four holes at the crotch almost instantly. It's not like it is too small for her either. There was plenty of room for her."
1.0,Absolutely worthless.
1.0,"This product is more than 4 inches smaller around the waist, than described and confirmed by measuring."
1.0,poor quality mechanism
1.0,"These earrings are absolutely beautiful, but they are very fragile. I had worn them only three times, and then the metal holding the crystal broke."
1.0,Much shorter than expected
1.0,Was not what I expected. Thick material and not made for a curvy body.
1.0,Every bracelet broke within 1 week.
1.0,Poorly made!  Cheapened by inferior materials.  Just doesn't look like I expected it to be.
1.0,The pants I received don’t have a bow on them. That’s literally why I ordered them. Will be returning.
1.0,Super bad quality. Looks extremely cheap.
1.0,Way too small. Returned it and bought something else
1.0,The fabric is ichy and not as soft as I expected. It fits like it’s supposed to on the picture but I was expecting a softer more cotton like fabric.
1.0,terrible quality so not what i was expecting
1.0,The sandals broke after 2 months use.. it was a really comfortable sandal but disappointed that it broke after 2 months use. I usually buy oofos and was happy that I found an alternative to oofos for a reasonable price. Looks like need to switch back to oofos..thoroughly disappointed
1.0,Do not order this! It is so cheap! It's so thin! It is very poor quality!
1.0,Way too big and nowhere near elastic-y enough to hold on to your face
1.0,"Purchased on different website.  Looks nice, but the 'manual' is worthless - doesn't even cover this watch - and it stopped working within a month.  The website on the back of the manual, www.monumentwatches.com, does not exist, so I'm trying to figure out how to send it in for repair, or replacement.  Buy beware"
1.0,Great material love the dress the only problem I had was it was very small on the top didn’t cover my big boobys  so had to return it
1.0,These pants are not the size listed.  They are suppose 8 and not 10/12.  If you order do yourself a favor abs size up 1 to 2 sizes!
1.0,Easily 3 inches shorter and 2 inches smaller in the waistline than another pair ordered from same seller/size and maker.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Super duper cheap.
1.0,"The fit is great, but the package looked like it had been returned and the costume came with a big hole in the crotch area, I tried to contact the seller 2 times and still no luck. Disappointed !"
1.0,i will be  returning  it. wast of my money..
1.0,"Plastic , very cheaply made, reminded me of a childs plastic birthday tiara I tried to return, Did not know you only had 2 weeks, or I would have made sure to do so. Very disappointed"
1.0,"Absolutely NOTHING like the picture. The front comes above the waist, the shoulder line is lower on one side than the other (poor sewing), and goes below the collar bone. The color is that of a more burnt orange and and teal, not bright colors at all. Returning for Refund."
1.0,The boots were not pleasing. The leather was flimsy
1.0,I ordered xl my usual size and couldn’t get it over my shoulders unless your a stick don’t waste your time!
1.0,Product arrived defective. Gremlin was blurry and looked like the byproduct of a picture made of a picture. There were dark spots on mine and writing was fuzzy.<br /><br />Seller said new necklace will be issued. I hope that I can alter my review at that time.
1.0,Way to small! Had to send back
1.0,"Cheap looking.  The “crystal” has no sparkle to it. It is cheap, glass. The dolphin does not really look much like the picture. I was quite disappointed."
1.0,It was prettier in picture than i  person. Bought thinking it would look more elegant with a prom dress. Got home to find I'd paid a lot more money for a child's dress up accessory than I should have.
1.0,"Bad quality, bad screenprinting. Just bad all around. Picture was off centered and looked horrible! Sent it back."
1.0,"Way too big, made for Shrek."
1.0,"Nice looking watch, bigger thicker than I had expected. I could have lived with that, what I could not live with is that it was not working when I got it. There was nothing in the packaging that could tell me how to make it start working. The manual was said to be on line but when I entered the model number for the watch it the web site identified that, yes this their watch, but no there was no manual."
1.0,"Much too large, but nothing offered smaller than a small. I'm 5'6'' and 120lbs."
1.0,"bad quality, zipper ripped when i tried to put it on. Measured to make sure i was ordering correct size and it was still too small. The material is thin and feels like it will easily tear."
1.0,Junk!!!!'nnn
1.0,Thin and small. Need to use better quality of shirt
1.0,It was so itchy it's not worth it.
1.0,Luz pobre
1.0,"Bought two sizes larger, yet I can barely fit my head through the neck area. When it's on it feels like the hoodie has me in a headlock. The inner material feels cheap."
1.0,"The dress is beautiful but it is small, I bought it in my size, I was very disappointed."
1.0,Not worth it. Size is way off and uncomfortable.
1.0,This 3x is more like for a medium man size. Not even close to a real 3x disappointing
1.0,"I purchased according to sizing chart and reviews. Not only is the product big on me, the material is also very flimsy. Feels as though it will rip easily. I am returning."
1.0,This bracelet is very cheap to the touch. Almost like plastic.
1.0,Disliked very much!!! Did not fit my head!......must be made for a baby😣
1.0,"The sizing is way off, they were like 2 sizes to small."
1.0,One pant leg was shorter than the other.
1.0,The masks are very small and do not have a metal bar in the upper seam.
1.0,6’4” 200lbs. Got a large. It is not an athletic fit at all. It is extremely boxy and short on the waist (will be unwearable after washing due to it being 100% cotton). There’s absolutely no taper. Good thing it was only $11. It will become my wife’s.
1.0,Lenses start disintegrating after 2 months. Just threw them away.
1.0,"These were terrible, they ran far too small and looked/felt like plastic!!"
1.0,The collar was off my shoulders.  Did not like it at all.  Material too thin.
1.0,Xl is actually a small in US sizes
1.0,I would give a zero star if I could! Out of the 24 I ordered 22 arrived broken.
1.0,It has an extremely unhealthy smell. Yuck.
1.0,This is S size.
1.0,Beautiful but made poorly. I opened the box and one was already broken. I ordered another pair and the same thing. I was desperate now because the wedding I was in was only a few days later and figured I could swap one if another was broken and that finally worked. So I returned 2 out of the 3 pairs and it was a pain.
1.0,Way shorter than I expected
1.0,These are not sunglasses. Received them as a gift and have to return. They are completely clear like reading glasses with only a slightly blue reflection. Pointless.
1.0,Its definitely not sized to the right proportions. The body fits a little lose but the bra part fits way too small. Not worth it.
1.0,"Wow can't believe this was $35, I've gotten better toys at the dollar general. Not is it just a piece of painted plastic, it broke within 5 min."
1.0,Too small! Not accurate sizing
1.0,Really bad quality after one use my ear turn green
1.0,very cheap looking the black is sorta of whitish like an imitation black once again NOT as black as the FALSE ADVERTISING picture
1.0,If I could give this konstarts I would. Very disappointed in this product. Disputed reading other reviews this product does not run true to size. It’s made small and the material is very thin and cheap looking.
1.0,"Seems like a decent shirt, looks nice, feels nice. Bought it for work but I never wear it because it's not really a slim fit unless you have a belly. Sadly I threw away the packaging and couldn't return it. Doesn't seem like it's tapered at the waist at all like a ""slim fit dress shirt"" should be. As a slim/athletically built person, hard to look professional/well dressed with a huge muffin top."
1.0,"I purchased this as a gift and the keychain looked used. It was tarnished and the elephants trunk appeared to be damaged. It was dull, dark grayish-black, and not at all what the picture depicted. I definitely wasn't able to give this as a gift and returned it."
1.0,Nice fabric and style but by no means is this a 6X for a man. They were incredibly small.
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter.  I knew it was cheap bc if the price, and man was it.  The Stone was chopped.  But I spent so little in it, I didn’t bother to return it or formally complain....  I guess what they’re banking on."
1.0,"Not true to size, I give it away"
1.0,color and pattern rubbed off completely within a week. looks like a plain silver band now.
1.0,I sent these back to the shipper.  They were too tight and uncomfortable to wear...even exercising on my Exercycle.  It just didn't fit right.
1.0,falls off easy
1.0,do not buy this dress.. very disappointed. Poor Stitching.. not what I expected to get .. fabric is hard and not appealing..bought this dress to wear for a wedding and now need to look for something else .
1.0,"HAT'S WERE THE WRONG SIZE. FOR LITTLE KIDS NOT GROWN MEN.LOGO WAS TOO SMALL, SHOULD HAVE BEEN TWICE THE SIZE.<br />SHIPPING BACK WAS A DISASTER. ALL THE WAY BACK TO CHINA. EVEN ON A SLOW BOAT,IT WAS EXPENSIVE.<br />AVOID THIS PRODUCT. IT'S NOT WORTH THE HASSLE."
1.0,Glasses that I received did not look like the one I purchased. And definitely not polarized.
1.0,Purchased the white and it is so thin and see thru! Not good quality.
1.0,"Ripped between the fingers the first time I put it on. Also it is extremely loose around the wrist, which I am not a fan of. Overall not what I expected, and I was really excited to get this glove.<br />Grip is nice, as advertised, but I chose to just throw it out after one use and go back to My old gloves. Disappointing."
1.0,not long as shown. poorly made
1.0,I could not open it once it was closed the product look beautiful but non functional for me. I had to use pliers to get my phone out of it money wasted
1.0,Not what was expected
1.0,"I bought these shorts for my 2 year old son. And when they arrived, they were huge. These are adult shorts.  Not even close to what I ordered. Just don't know what else to say. Something went completely wrong with their packaging system"
1.0,I’m never going to wear this color! I went away for the weekend opened the package and they are gray the texture is rough and the quality is cheap.
1.0,My son and husband said they were too short in the legs.
1.0,The color of these leggings is nothing like what the picture and description described them as. The color is 5 times lighter than what you get.
1.0,Material thin and not sized correct
1.0,These are unbelievably soft but I think I wore them 2-3x before the crotch blew out. Super bummed. They work great as a rag to dust furniture though.
1.0,I have not even had this for two weeks before the zippers broke and the fabric started to fall apart. It is made cheaply. Save your money.
1.0,Stem was broken when it arrived.
1.0,They broke after a week and half of wear. Useless.
1.0,Yes it’s big on the face which helps when you talk it’s doesn’t fall down.
1.0,Pretty much impossible to wear as a tragus earring. The ball screws in the back rather than the front so you can't screw it in.
1.0,Absolutely looks NOTHING like the picture! So disappointed and I only got 70% of my money back. Such a rip off! Don’t buy from this seller unless you want a terrible product and not all your money back for a false advertised item!!!!
1.0,I didn't care for the fabric and the picture is a bit deceiving as far as how it looks. It's rather frumpy and the pic looks NOTHING like the actual product. Very disappointed.
1.0,It looks really cheap and disproportionate. It rust within 2 weeks of having it and I didn't even wet it! I was so disappointed it looked nothing like it did in the picture.
1.0,"cheaply made. pretty, but lost two rhinestones within a few days."
1.0,"These say ""Teen jeans"" .... They are not. They might fit a 5 or 6 year old. Toddler Sized. Misadvertised."
1.0,Frame is cheaply made and breaks easy
1.0,"My son had trouble walking in these.  The bottom of the shoe is not a flat sole but pieces of it which only cover the middle of the shoe.  As such, the walk is very wobbly."
1.0,"This is no more linen, than my dog is made out of linen!"
1.0,I was disappointed in the material. It was a shapeless shirt. Certainly not worth the money. And I had to pay to ship it back and pay a processing fee! It was a costly mistake to have ordered from this vendor.
1.0,This item reeks if a really toxic fishy plastic smell.  Don’t even want it in my house or car it smells so bad.  Returning.
1.0,Bought XL and fits too tight. Other XL sizes are a little big on me. Will not purchase again.
1.0,The seams have strings hanging everyplace.
1.0,This dress is not true to size in plus size. The material is also thin and see thru.
1.0,"I want to return how do I return. This dress<br />Too big, too long,  do not like material"
1.0,This dress looks very nice but it is dirty and used there is also no head band or silver pin in front
1.0,"The garment itself doesn't do the picture justice. This is a thin, cheaply made sweater that looks like it would fall apart in a single washing. Pass."
1.0,"This art is stolen, not cool."
1.0,over 15 broke with in minnets of being worn. I can't use or sell them if they break so easly.I would like my money back.
1.0,IT HURTS!!!!!!. really ugly looking. I contacted the seller but no one reply me.
1.0,"See pattern of knot in neck rash? I am not allergic to silver. I am, however, allergic to nickel. Buyer beware!"
1.0,"I have too varying size measurements between bust, waist & hips. If u take those & try to decide what size against the size chart, I'm all over the place in sizes. Difficult to know what size to order. Even more difficult after u read reviews from people who say it ran big or small."
1.0,"Trying these leggings on was not a pleasant experience. I wear a size 2 petite so I am not a heavy set woman but I do have curves. All major brand capri leggings in a size small fit me fine (rebock, nike, under armour) but these were easily 2 inches longer than they should have been while on me. I took them off and measured the inseam at 23.5. That extra inch and a half in a streatch fabric equates to a lot of extra length on the body. I really dont even think these would be capri length unless you were 5'10"". The fabric doesnt breath either. Like. At. All. In my bedroom with the fan on in the dead of winter, I was already overheating and I typically run cold (I sleep with a heated blanket and wool socks, I mean come on!). It also came with either a stain or a mark in the fabric on the thigh already. This product was a joke."
1.0,It appears as they took a sample of of what the dress was supposed to be and made less appealing versions of it with a way to get it on. Could not get the dress pass my shoulders. Save your money
1.0,"Just cheap fabric and I usually wear medium. I am 5'6"" and this fits too large."
1.0,"Cheap looking, horrible fit. Cape so small and head piece folded up in packaging couldn't be smoothed out enough to wear."
1.0,"Very odd fit, looked like a swim cap on my head. Maybe it's supposed to look that way?  Anyway it was uncomfortably tight and looked weird. Also the stripes are white, not reflective. Only reflective patch is a very small logo on the bottom."
1.0,Fits small I gave mine to a very skinny teenager and they fit her perfectly.
1.0,The chain fell off so cheap
1.0,Not polarized as stated in ad
1.0,"Loved it. However, the wings kept snagging on my cloths until the loop let go and broke.  Sad my angel wing broke."
1.0,This was fake!!!
1.0,These are wristlets not lanyards & im pissed!
1.0,"Absolutely horrible when I opened my package, there was a bunch of black markings and looks like someone had previously owned this. This is absolutely horrible. I was so excited to get this and as soon as I opened the packaging this is what it looked like. I have to give a star but I wouldn’t if it was my choice."
1.0,"I was unable to wear this dress because it was too see through. very cheap material, it doesn't look as good as the photo. I definitely wouldn't buy it again."
1.0,All the attachments were not in my pkg so I was only able to use 1 mask
1.0,Socks were not 100% cotton as stated in product description.  Package indicates they are “performance blend.”
1.0,"I wore this to work, it was very comfortable.  The reason I have given it 2-only 1 star is because my id badge, which is on a lanyard, caused the material on the front of the dress to pill and wear down the fabric to the point wear I can't wear it again. So disappointed! It's a fun dress but the fabric is of poor quality. No way I can even fix it! One time wear is not for me!"
1.0,"A wrist pin falls out.  The first time it happened was still within the return period.  I ordered a second pair and the wrist pin fell out 3 weeks after the return period.  I was very gentle on the second one, pulling the jaw with my thumb before clamping down."
1.0,Not right product delivered.
1.0,There are four pictures  the first two are different than the last and I received the last. It’s a different print and color. Very disappointed.
1.0,I purchased this jacket for my grandson who is a teenager.  It did not last long.  Bad material for the price.
1.0,"I literally wore these shades 3 times and one of the arms just came off. I wouldn't waste my money purchasing these again. Very cheaply made. Plus, the lens distorts how things are seen."
1.0,Good idea but it fits my husbands neck my kids neck it was too big... the Velcro didn’t extend far around enough to make it tight enough to his neck. Unfortunately I bought it for my kid. I read it wasn’t big enough for adults on other reviews before purchasing but the opposite was true for me.
1.0,Didn’t receive my package and it was canceled so don’t know what happen.
1.0,Way too small.  Ordered a size up and it was still too small.
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap materials. The skirt is obnoxiously large. It looks like cheap Halloween costume material.
1.0,This product was way to small and the sizes are not as advertised.
1.0,"Totally see through when bent over, wouldnt recommend these at all."
1.0,Runs really small need to go up 0nebif not 2 sizes! Returned it!
1.0,Not at all what I expected. Made very cheap!<br />Would never have bought this if I saw it in person.
1.0,"Highly overrated. Ordered these socks for the cold blast we had last week here in the northeast as I work outdoors. They failed miserably, my feet were freezing."
1.0,"Total junk, doesn't go on ear and broke just trying."
1.0,"Picture shows Correa, but jersey has no name or number."
1.0,"You get what you pay for. It doesn't really glow in the dark as promised and when it arrives the flower was already falling apart inside the jar. It's pretty, but obviously cheaply made. However it did arrive promply and interactions with the seller were good."
1.0,these are very fragile and the rubberized grip comes off very easily when trying to attach the glasses.  I would not buy these again!
1.0,"Clamp has poor grip, too tight after screw tighten. Best use as a pusher."
1.0,Strap broke the second I tried it on.
1.0,The gems fell off. Cheap and bad quality!
1.0,Was the wrong color never got retuned one back!
1.0,"The watches are fine, but one was broken when it arrived"
1.0,I thought this was supposed to be a bracelet - wouldn't be big enough for an infant.
1.0,"These compression socks are just socks, very thin material, they didn’t seem like compressions socks to me. The reviews were incorrect."
1.0,Way too tight and uncomfortable material.
1.0,"False advertising—this is a 7.5 ft umbrella NOT 9ft.  Feel very misled. Umbrella edge at 46inches when closed. Maybe 8ft in diameter fully opened. But nowhere near 9ft.  So if truth in advertising and size matters to you, this is not the umbrella for you. Spend a bit more and get the actual diameter that you are paying for."
1.0,After a years worth of use...the mechanism to release the belt broke. I had to cut the belt with a knife to get it off. I've had belts that last several years....extremely disappointed that this one broke.
1.0,The jacket is made out of a very cheap material. The color is also not purple as described but a burgundy with more red/brown undertones. The jacket in the picture is of a higher quality than the one received. Only similarity is the jacket is the same style.
1.0,This was a christmad gift. It's only 2 months old and the numbers are falling off of it
1.0,Did not spin
1.0,"The white shirt showed up with a huge hole in the side and the button slot on the blue jumper is going to rip quickly. Not good quality at all, I'm pretty disappointed."
1.0,I don't like the plastic zipper
1.0,The lenses were WAY darker than they show in the picture. I returned them.
1.0,No give no stretch fabric is itchy and irritating not comfortable at all
1.0,"I don't often leave negative reviews, as I prefer to just reward the good vendors.  But, I was so surprised when I got these masks.  I know they are chinese, and have different regulations.  But i had no idea they had dozens of little holes all in rows on both sides of the masks, that you can actually look through!  I can't imagine how these would be useful for ANYTHING, Covid or not.  Dust?  Pollen?  Nothing.  Just threw them away."
1.0,Started to break when I first washed it. Wish it was a more quality piece because the fabrics are beautiful!
1.0,Who do you make these dresses for?? I got your smallest size which is supposed to fit a 2-4. This dress is for someone who would wear a large. I get that people think most Americans are overweight but some of ya are an actual size 2. You’re measurements are way off.
1.0,Love the look but I only wore them once and 2 large crystals fell out :( I couldn’t find a way to contact the seller to ask for a replacement or some replacement crystals
1.0,Neck is way too guppy and the zipper closure at the bottom does not allow for diaper changes.  Couldn't wear again.
1.0,The size was terribly wrong.  I can't even squeeze into it. I don't even know if my 11 year old could put it on.  Such a shame - wanted to try it out
1.0,I returned this as it was not what I wanted and I still do not have a credit to my account can someone check this out?
1.0,Very cheaply made. I purchased two and both began to unravel at the seams. Very disappointed.
1.0,I purchased this dress (same picture) from another vendor but in a size too big. That dress was incredible so I searched again and accidentally purchased the dress advertised as the same pic from this vendor. The dress looked nothing like the picture or the other dress (which was accurately shown). The material was cheap. The vendor was difficult with and wouldn't accept the return. Now I'm stuck with a dress I can't wear that I still had to pay for.
1.0,Very light weight not warm
1.0,"The washing instructions on this dress said to wash in cold water.  As soon as I put this dress in the water, the water turned pink.  That is when I began to panic.  Now the black has run all over the dress and the pink has bled.  Tried my best to save this dress but too much damage.  DO NOT SPEND YOUR $200 on this dress.  Total waste of money!!!!!  Now my window of return has passed.  What a rip off."
1.0,"Too small, fits very tight - no room."
1.0,This is like a ‘little girl’ top and not made well. Junk!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:588b89a8a9562c6b8ebcaf28f0172cbf]] This fits fine but this is not a high intensity sports bra. The material is thin and with no real support. Will return.
1.0,No water proof  water go ensite
1.0,Very low quality material. Returning.
1.0,They don't work. The person I bought them for has diabetes I don't know if that has something to do with it but they did not work at all for him
1.0,"Why do I have to give a star?  I would give these 0 stars.  I love mystic metals but every taper I've gotten from them has been too small.  I'm currently at 7/16"" (11mm) and wanted to stretch to 1/2"" (12mm).  On the package it says 12mm (1/2"") but they slid right thru.  I put it end to end with my 7/16 plug and it's the exact same size.  So frustrated.  Returned and refund thanks to Amazon."
1.0,Size description off. Cheap feeling material.
1.0,Came in damaged had to hot glue.
1.0,Bought small and its was like an  xl
1.0,Purchased an xl and I'm not big. it's like trying to get in a sasauge casing plus the zipper is trash. Waste of money complete trash.
1.0,Way too small! XL was more of a Small.
1.0,"I bought this dress because I liked the ""cut"" of the dress, I know that the particular shape would be a figure flattering style.  The shape IS figure flattering, but the material is so cheap you can see a red bra through a black dress.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,Do not buy this product poorly made and unacceptable in every way what company or person would send something like this to anybody.
1.0,Don't like the way the toes fit. They were too long (I'm 5'2&#34;) and dug into the back of my knees.
1.0,Cheaply made. I returned it.
1.0,Cheap! First time I wore these earrings 3 of the stones fell out!
1.0,Too small and super cheapy looking. I would have returned it if it wasn't such a pain to return. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I don’t even know what the hekk this is. Material is very cheap and thin, disappointing.<br />Don’t buy it!<br />Other people’s review on here are a lie, this is a waste of money, returned!"
1.0,"There should label on clothes from China!!!  These were “supposed” to be compression tights. There was little to no compression at all.<br /><br />Poor, poor quality!!!"
1.0,Broke into little pieces the second I tried it on for the first tine. GARBAGE
1.0,"I really wanted to like these, they're super cute without being over the top. But they irritated my piercing immediately, causing the top of the hole to become red and itchy. I should say I've had my piercing for almost 14 years and had never had a single issue with it before I put these in. Be careful if you have sensitive skin."
1.0,"Cheap material, seams were not linear or symmetrical.  Worst fitting pants I ever bought."
1.0,Runs small. Had to return it.
1.0,"These are so poorly made I can't stand to wear them. They're sewn crooked which makes every pair in the pack fit differently. One is so bad, it's a permanent wedgie on the left side. It's unacceptable.<br />And the crotch has a useless 2 inch piece of cotton HALF sewn in so it's constantly moving about.<br /><br />If I hadn't washed and worn these already, I'd have returned them immediately. Now I'm stuck with a waste of money and fabric."
1.0,"Don't waste your money!<br />It's very small on M size and the material it's ok but inside it's too hot material, not for me that lives in Florida! I give away,,,"
1.0,Don’t stretch and extremely disappointed
1.0,quality and color is not as pictured. Picture looks more filtered
1.0,"The color was not pinkish as it looks in the picture.  They are more of a flesh tone.  The posts were bent and sticking out of the package when received.  I tried bending them back to where they should be, but they are close to breaking off now.  The price wasn't worth returning."
1.0,"Wish I would have read all the reviews. These really do have what appears to be swastikas on every single pair of socks. This is repulsive, even if it wasn't intentional and accidental stitching to appear like that. I was going to do a return but considering just burning them so no one else has to receive these."
1.0,Was not at all what I thought... too small and very cheaply made.
1.0,I am 5’11” ... was not made for me. Like Sir Mix a-lot said ... only if she’s 5’ 3”.
1.0,I did not like them.
1.0,"I only got nine of what's shown, but paid for 10.  I was really looking forward to the really long one and didn't get it. Instead I got two of the same chokers. Very disappointed."
1.0,Very disappointed with the quality of the product
1.0,"It looks so cute in the pictures but it’s too small, sleeves too short. It looks ridiculous on and I followed the sizing correctly."
1.0,"Unfortunately, this didn't work for me at all.  I'm a 36/38 D and the white pads inserted in the cups don't come close to covering anything and instead make your chest look really strange.  I ended up removing them which is fine but I'm not sure who they would fit.  I then spent the rest of the day hiking the bra up every time I bent over or moved at all.  I would not recommend this and likely won't wear it much."
1.0,"I purchased 3 shirts for my grandson, reviews were good. A few said small, but purchasing by age (9-13) I should have known better. Two of the shirts arrived Medium toddler. No way a 10 year old could wear this shirt. I have 1 more coming next week will also have to send back. Too bad quality and print looked great. Raisevern will have to work on their sizing. Will not purchase again, too much trouble sending them back."
1.0,Fit was terrible. Might work better on someone with a bigger head.
1.0,Not worth the money....nothing else to way
1.0,"item looks diffrent than advertised, but its not worth the return postage. so its just a waste of time and money."
1.0,Looked used did not have tags.
1.0,"I am so disappointed. Cheap material. Thrown together, wrong size, not identical to photo, the belt is skinny. I'm upset. I ordered this fir family and friends day on sunday. It arrived on time just not satisfied. I'm sad it's still in the plastic. ..Returning immediately! I ordered 3x, look and fits like a large"
1.0,I won't it a size 11 in men
1.0,Its not as pictured. The color is darker and not as wide as the picture and very cheap material for 30$<br />It look awaful when i try it. Not as pictured at all .<br />See my pictures
1.0,Cheap dont waste your money!! Very flimsy not very well built at all.....
1.0,"I ordered this belly button ring specifically because it was a peacock. Unfortunately, the belly button ring I actually received was a flower, and not what was pictured. Additionally, the flower actually fell off this week after just a month of wearing. Extremely disappointed in both the quality and the misrepresentation of this product."
1.0,"The entire jumpsuit was sheer!!! I returned item!!!<br />However if you like sheer then it would be OK, The fit was perfect. It was true to size. I am very curvy on the bottom and small at the top, my only issue was you could see through it."
1.0,This is quite frustrating and not compatible with covers.
1.0,Not RFID blocking.
1.0,cheap one of them broke when i opened it up.
1.0,Very thin you can see right through them Was not made good horrible fabric Would not recommend these to  anyone I returned them Honestly there's nothing like the picture Don't waste your time If I could give this a 0 star I would
1.0,Belt was smaller than the shorts waist! Material was ehhh
1.0,"I normally do t respond to reviews because we each have our own opinions, however I am so disappointed. I bought these earring to wear with snaps I had purchased. Now that I read other reviews these should be checked before they are sent out. I am truly disappointed. Now the outfit I gave to wear to the annual outside barbecue doesn’t have a pair of earrings to match. Bummer"
1.0,Complete garbage. They fit okay at the waste but way longer than expected.<br /><br />They were not waterproof or resistant and not durable. They claim to be good snow pants but they weren't. Also RIPPED on the first run on the ski slopes. Right through the crotch. Had to suck it up and feel the breeze for a while.
1.0,too long o a fit and material is cheap. I would not purchase these again
1.0,"Nice material, but Dress does not look like photo and it was a hassle dealing with the seller trying to return the item. Would not buy from the seller again!"
1.0,"Much much smaller than what was seen in the photo on the website.  Had difficulty putting them on - they were thin and did not stay in place. Anyway, they  fell off a couple of hours later. But not a big loss. Would not recommend buying them. If I could give no stars, I would."
1.0,The strap on the shoe broke after only two days.
1.0,not the correct size the large it is like a extra small in united states
1.0,I not happy with this product it not good stuff disnt hold up
1.0,They arrived broken. They were poorly packaged and cheaply made. The white wasn’t as white as I expected it to be either. Over all pretty disappointed.
1.0,looks so cheap.
1.0,This dress was a horrible polyester. Felt bad on the skin and was too big. Returned.
1.0,Terribly quality.  Went black in a week.
1.0,The jacket I got in the mail was a knock off old navy jacket that was no Sherpa in any way. Just a grey jacket. You could also tell the old navy sticker was old and fake and sewn on because it was dirty and didn’t even have a size on it. DO BOT BUY!!!!
1.0,"Gloves clearly displayed and desired for their  pink color. However, what was received were a pair of gloves whose color is not on any color wheel in the world!! A single star rating is too generous for this purchase. How do you spell RETURN!"
1.0,I am 5'6 and this dress was extremely tight over my bust. I am a 36 D and the fabric does not stretch at all. It made my chest area look odd. I normally wear a small 2-4 in dress's but would probably recommed going up 2 sizes if you are larger chested.
1.0,Its too large. Don't buy as per size.
1.0,"It arrived with no instructions, so I sent it back."
1.0,"Pulled wrong size,RETURNED"
1.0,"The dress, in reality, is not what the picture shows. The skirt is not at all flowy, its rather straight. The cuffs on the sleeves are not as pictured either. Definitely returning."
1.0,Not one size fits all especially if you have hips.
1.0,Size runs small.. and material is too thin..
1.0,Only a month old and already peeling.
1.0,Returned it. Material just wasn't expected. Wish it worked out loved the pattern.
1.0,Xxl size may fit medium
1.0,"Unfortunately, this photo is very misleading. It is incredibly flimsy, not heavy with embroidery. The color is also a stark white, which makes it look even cheaper. May be great for someone else, but wanted to call attention to the discrepancy in the photo."
1.0,2 sizes too small.  ordered large 2x and got a small both times
1.0,Sides are not as thick and high waisted as photos shown. Not happy with this purchase
1.0,"These are not &#34;wide&#34; and are not &#34;loose&#34;.  They ship from England and take a long time to arrive.  If you want to return them, you pay the return postage to England."
1.0,Runs small but seems like good quality
1.0,This ring does not look like the picture. I bought 2 and I'm definitely disappointed. I will never buy anything from this company again.
1.0,Este próducto no lo e pedido
1.0,Fit is mid leading. My daughter is 3 years old and the 4-6x was far to small. She will only wear dresses and she refused to wear.
1.0,"Runs really small. I got the 4 T for my toddler and the shirt was a crop top on her. Tried to return it, but unfortunately I waited past my return window. So we’re stuck with a $25 swimsuit that we’ll never use."
1.0,I bought the XL and the sleeves were too tight.  I am not a large women and I like my coats over sized.  It was too thin.
1.0,poor quality and it is not at all as it is pictured. Maybe it was sent incorrectly!!!!
1.0,"It's definitely not stainless steel.  Really nice style, but whatever they plated it with plating quickly wore off to reveal a base metal.<br />It's also definitely not hypoallergenic. Both of my ears became infected.<br />It's a very cute style.  I just wished the description had been accurate.  It's fun, 'junk' jewelry."
1.0,Even a large was small
1.0,Nothing close to color. Can't distinguish it from black one.
1.0,"This is comfortable, stays in place."
1.0,"The fabric does not strike me as linen and I ordered a 4x hoping that they would have a baggy fit. (I am between a 2x - 3x) they were way too small, I couldn't even get them up. I was pretty disappointed."
1.0,Very bad cheap quality for the price and the brand
1.0,"Extremely poor quality and cheap. I've used a lot of key reels, and this i by far the worst. The product description is pretty fake. Its not heavy duty at all. The clip is not string and barely keeps it on your belt. The string is super thin and started to fray within days of using it only about 3 times a day. The triangle ring between the clip and the badge holder isn't strong enough to stay closed when pulling the reel.<br /><br />After using these terrible things. Ended up buying a Keybak instead."
1.0,Lol....there is no way this could be what they said it was. I bought this for my sister and it's just too funny to say what some of the reviews pointed out.
1.0,"I ordered two of these necklaces and the clasps broke on both of them the first time we tried to use them which, unfortunately, was my wedding day. Don't buy them, they are CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP."
1.0,Very very thin!!! Just not what I expected
1.0,I like it but way too small go up two sizes
1.0,There is NO way these are made for women. Even a child would have trouble getting them on. They are ridiculously small. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"This sports bra is not for high impact sports. I adjusted anything that can be adjusted and it is still bouncy. The two rows of hooks on the back are also not very easy to hook up. Do not recommend. The same brand but a different sports bra, La Isla Women's High Impact Full Coverage Wire Free Lightly Padded Sports Bra, is a much better choice."
1.0,"Took very long to arrive, and is broken way too quicky"
1.0,He put the watch on and the latch part broke. So this watch was defective.
1.0,Can’t get them on because of the hard plastic ring. Was going to use them for cycling.
1.0,Only thing my daughter shoes only worked for one day when we charged them they never came back on and she only wore them once
1.0,These look nothing like the picture the flared out at bottom so I feel like im wearing a parachute
1.0,This dress had a seam right down the FRONT of it where it should’ve been on the back of the dress. The fabric didn’t match up along the seam and looks awful. I definitely would not recommend it this dress to anyone until it’s made correctly.
1.0,"Bought for a teenage girl that helps me around my house. Myself being handicap I thought it would be a nice little thank you, but they just didn’t fit and kept falling off top of ear. So I tried them and of course they pulled my lower ear lobe up."
1.0,"OMG!  I usually wear a large, but got the XL since it was a tight fitting shirt, but I could not even get it over my head!<br />Picture is very deceiving!"
1.0,If you want to look like an Amish girl this is for you.
1.0,"Terrible product. Would not recommend to my worst enemy. Sylar would probably be afraid of the seller. It broke 30 seconds out of the poor quality package. It's not metal, it's like a carbon plastic BS POS GD MF POS GUUUUUUUUUUH"
1.0,Very thin bands. Looked more like costume jewelry.
1.0,The picture is not the same as the product. Cheap leather that smells like it is leftover car seat material.<br />Not impressed.
1.0,Not a quality product.  Reminded me of rayon.  Wrinkled something awful.  Put fabric softener when washed and it stained top.<br />Very disappointed.
1.0,Loose so it falls off
1.0,Material feels like cardboard
1.0,"Poor fit, returned and did not reorder, fit like maternity top"
1.0,"The material is great, the top is too small, gave it to my 21 year old daughter"
1.0,Not happy with this item way too big for my3 yr old grandson and very wide
1.0,"Very disappointed in this jacket.  It says it is flannel, cotton.  It is not!  It looks like polyester, sort of a foam look.  I doubt it is cotton.  The colors are printed on, it's sort of shiny, just looks bad. I know it came from China, and I doubt I will get my money back if I send it.  Don't buy from this company."
1.0,When I open the package and got my tie out I saw that it was cut. Other than that it was a really nice looking tie.
1.0,"Whoever decided that this was supposed to be sexy and or any sort of bra had to be out of their mind. It was a good concept maybe I just have way too much boob to make it work. However I know very well that a nylon string that you find in hoodies or cheap backpacks is not sexy and definitely should not be the string to string up your open front bra. It just ain’t it. I managed to get it on, however one wrong move or one cough or sneeze and the thing would’ve hit the floor. Save your money, find some thing else."
1.0,The screen print to light. Will not buy again
1.0,Not the right size and di not look like the picture. It was a hot mess.
1.0,The watch was beautiful but 1 day late the watch stop and nos it does hoy work.
1.0,Cute shoe. Too small....
1.0,Not at all what I expected. Cheap fabric. Very unhappy
1.0,my chest would have to have been left home if I wore this dress and one shoulder looked like it was used in star trek.
1.0,Avoid these and all others like them. Two pair got holes in toes on first wearing. You're better off with dollar store socks.
1.0,"I've owned many spyder brand shirts and I can immediately tell that these shirts are not genuine. Cloth is cheep, logo is not the same and I am very disappointed. Material is very thin and cheap material that is itchy when in fact spyder t-shirts are known for their soft well knit quality. DO NOT recommend!"
1.0,Too small and the bars are short
1.0,Garbage. The fabric is scratchy asnd then fell apart in the wash the first time. I washed and went to put in the dryer and it was a ball of underwear and string. Awful quality. Save your money!
1.0,I could wear these as a skirt the neck hole is far too large. I want my money back. Do not buy these.
1.0,"Horrible smell, I washed the jacket twice and it still smelled like raw eggs."
1.0,Returned. Not compression or dry for material. See through.
1.0,"Sweater finally arrived from China.  I was so looking forward to trying it on,  but I'm disappointed. I would not have purchased it if I tried it on in a store.  It's overpriced for the quality. I'm going to try to live with it because I'm afraid a refund would take twice as long as the shipping took."
1.0,"I received this watch as a gift and the band is tight.  I have small wrists... any other watch that I have received,  I usually have it sized smaller.  Its too bad because it is a pretty watch that I probbly won't wear because its uncomfortable."
1.0,This is ridiculous....I waited all this time to get this skirt and ordered it in an XXL (18-20) and the thing looks like it can fit a baby doll... will never purchase from them again.... I want my money back and fast....
1.0,Horrible product They rip extremely easily
1.0,"Stiff, itchy, starchy"
1.0,30&#34; long chain was only 27&#34;. Not a happy camper.
1.0,Pretty but broke after only wearing  it a few times.
1.0,Not even a week and it changed color. I don't recommend.
1.0,I’ve worn this band twice and band broke off from the part that attaches to the watch. Super cheap. I don’t recommend!
1.0,I bought 3 of them and each one has thicker or thinner material
1.0,"Bought 2X, too small; 3X too big. Material meant for 'slender-ize' ?"
1.0,Not quite what I want
1.0,The product is described as part of a set with a glove keeper and an American flag face gater. Imagine my complete disgust upon being shipping a blue line flag instead.
1.0,What I received was not what is pictured. I received a small brown watch cost most likely $5.00... with no writing on face.  Blank. They took 23.00 dollars and replaced it with a 5.00 value at most.  Very unhappy.
1.0,"Super thin materials, and fits about two sizes too small."
1.0,1 pack instead of 2?????
1.0,"The shirt looked nice and it fit like it should. I wear a medium and it's just right, not tight, not baggy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this shirt was never meant to be worn. The fabric is horrendous. I put the shirt on and it started falling apart. First one section of fabric started separating and then another. I held it up to the light and you can see the fabric falling apart (like gym shorts that have all the perforated holes in them). You can put the fabric between your thumb and finger, snap you finger, and it will tear.<br /><br />The manufacturer must have known this was cheap fabric because the neck and shoulders are reinforced with a different fabric.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY"
1.0,Stones were out of butterfly when item arrived!
1.0,"I purchased this to wear as a dress, it is a nightgown; not even a beach cover up!"
1.0,Received these lenses for my Square Wire 2.0's and I was really excited about them as the original lenses have been scratched for a couple years. These simply did not fit the frame. They were too small and left gaps between the frame and the lense. The lenses fall out with the slightest touch making cleaning them impossible. In the pictures below you can see the gaps and there is one picture with the original lens behind the new one showing how off these are in size. Left really disappointed by this and will be returning them promptly.
1.0,"It's cheap af looks like the rings from the gum ball machines for kids (heartbreaking) nothing like the picture where it shows a real smooth rounded, maybe titanium? Ring. This ring is made of cheap thin metal with rough cut, semi sharp edges. It was laser cut and not smoothed at all! I would say it's for kids but I'm afraid to give it to my daughter it's rough has potential to cut a finger. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1.0,They slip and the buckle digs into the top of my foot. Difficult to keep on.
1.0,Does fit or feel like a crew neck sweatshirt. Cheaply made and the color is way off
1.0,This product was horrible and I sent it back!
1.0,The golf plating came off.  I really loved this bracelet but the playing coming off on my trip in was a bit embarrassing.
1.0,Horribly baggy there’s nothing scary about these leather jeans they just look gaudy and shiny. Very fake
1.0,"It was too small from top to bottom, very warm and very very uncomfortable.  Didn't fit well.  I will use it only as an accommodation when interviewing people who lipread, not returning it as I don't need the hassle.  VERY slow shipping and disappointing when it came.  Didn't look at all like the photo."
1.0,Como va a ser que una chaqueta va a ser de tela de Licra?  Perdí mi dinero no la compren orrible 😡
1.0,I hated the material and sent it back
1.0,Ugly shirt. Very wide
1.0,I was thinking that the necklaces would be great but when my boyfriend got them this is what they look like. The &#34;His only&#34; heart doesn't line up with the other one and it looks like there is a scribbled on it too along with a chipped piece as well. The other heart looks like it's flat or has some dents in it. Honestly it's not the best quality of a necklace.
1.0,The pic gives the impression it's 2 bags one smaller very misleading
1.0,"These sunglasses were super heavy, I couldn't keep them on my face"
1.0,I don’t like this product at all it’s very cheep material and it’s very ugly looking .
1.0,Too small for Women with c cup or larger breast... you need to bee flat chested to buy this
1.0,Dress fit my size 7 granddaughter. Also it was ankle length not maxi.
1.0,"I got this product December 15, 2022 it is February 14, 2023 and it's already gone from gold to bronze and has horrible spotting on the metal AND the figure broke off. The quality is not what I expected, I expected it to last longer before the metal turned colors and the figure broke. BTW I work from home so it's not like my keys are taken off the hook by our door very often. Don't bother buying it because once it's past the return date Amazon doesn't care about the product or how it dissolves trust in the Amazon brand."
1.0,these sizes are not american sizes...i never know what to buy from amazon...it is very sad....
1.0,I tryed to have my kids zip it one day. My guy the next<br /> I thought I was a 16 but I ordered a 3x on the other reviews. The zipper would not move
1.0,Very poor quality. I will not buy these again. The findings break off way too easily.
1.0,The cross as other reviewers have stated comes in two peaces. the outer cross is flexible and came off and was lost the first day I wore it. Put in a little more money to get a quality product. Shipping was also very slow.
1.0,Really low quality. Better off cutting off an old pair of sweats than this.
1.0,Nothing like picture at all
1.0,Lights stopped working the second day. Black trim around the shoes started peeling today! A waste of $25 and one upset kid!
1.0,Defective stitching at front seam that connects neck collar. It causes an uneven bumpy seam. How could this get by quality control it stares right at you !?!?!<br /><br />Update: i bought two a black and a dark blue today i received the black and just like the dark blue the seams are messed up. So this confirms its not a defected shirt i had received. This is in fact the low quality craftsmanship they are accustomed too. Not worth the money. Terrible
1.0,"It was a terrible dress. The fabric was cheap and the skirt felt like a cheap throw away table cloth. I was very disappointed because the picture looks so cute, but the dress was like something off of wish."
1.0,Definitely not true to size an extra large should’ve been very roomy for me and believe me it was not
1.0,"You get what you pay for. $5 boots don't stay on baby feet, so I couldn't even use them for pictures. Don't waste the money."
1.0,"Pass on this one. Listing says it runs small...no kidding! An XXL is about the size of a medium!...if you need a 2X then order at least a 4X....but wait!...there is no 4X, so there's that. Graphics are poor compared to the photo, quality is sub par, cannot recommend!"
1.0,The lenses themselves are great so far.<br />The issue is that they stopped transitioning from clear to black after about 2 weeks. Since then they'll only get very very lightly shaded that its basically clear even while standing in the sun all day.
1.0,This pin arrived with the actual pin arm already broken off.  I returned it immediately.  I purchased this pin for my daughter's faux fur shawl.  I certainly would not trust this flimsy pin to do the job.  I did not ask for a replacement.<br />The pin does look just like the pictures.<br />The flower is a wine / burgundy color.<br />Pin looks cheap.  Definitely not durable.
1.0,Wasnt what i expected.
1.0,Turns green within a few weeks.
1.0,"Faded really quickly, only had for a few weeks. Quality isn’t great."
1.0,Bottom piece fell off after 2 days.
1.0,The bust line hits through the middle of my breast. It is too long. Beware i would have returned but had to pay shipping to China. More than i paid for the dress.
1.0,One earring was fine..the other one has a knot in it that I can't get out. Not very happy!
1.0,Didn't fit at all ! Says 2x it's more of a large
1.0,"I don't have that big of wrists,  and this did not fit. And it supposedly was large size. Also, it was a faded pink,  not very bright like I was hoping."
1.0,I wear  2X normally....this fits at about a large.....plus it has a nasty smell.....save your money
1.0,ordered two pairs a large and xl and they fit like a small and a medium
1.0,This is not built to be a workout waist trainer. There is no way possible to workout in this thing. Also the sizing is way off. I measured myself and used the chart as reference and it is still too small. This item is sold as a mini corset on the actually Shymay site so I do not understand why this is saying workout waist trainer. Complete waist of money.
1.0,"I don’t write reviews and I bout this item a couple months ago in May so it’s a late review. Anyways, these glasses broke not 2 months after I received them, not 2 weeks but 2 days after I got them. I was not harsh on them seeing as they were brand new and I had the same problem others have had with the ear pierce snapping. It snapped while I was wearing them just driving. If I could give 0 stars I would."
1.0,super cheap paint everywhere
1.0,"The beeper effect on the device doesn't work. Device doesn't want to pair with the app and the thing doesn't want to hard reset when I follow the instructions. At the end of the process the light flash red,green,and yellow. I would like to get a replacement to give it one more try."
1.0,I bought this dress and the others for running errands around town. I was going into a Store and an older gentleman that remarked that my dress was too short for my age.
1.0,The swim suit also is discolored with orange spots
1.0,"Not real leather, too hard to bend, just looks and feels like a $1 wallet"
1.0,It is a beautiful dress but the material was too thin.
1.0,The lenses were not in the frames when they arrived. They are way too small to fit tightly in the frame! The lenses fall out constantly on both pair! Junk! Don't order these.
1.0,No actual sparkles. Not as pictured.
1.0,"Fit is fine and I like these, but the 2nd time I wore them the stitching in the waistband came apart!?"
1.0,"I loved this wallet until I took it on a trip abroad and after less than a month of use, the zipper broke and it's impossible to zip all the way closed. I have been in South America where shipping was not an option so the return window has closed and I have not been able to get in contact with the seller. Total waste as of now and its really a shame because it's the perfect wallet despite this."
1.0,"Way, way too large. Not for a mature person at all! Save your money!"
1.0,"Seller doesn't know how to shape the hat, I like to shape my brim."
1.0,Such poor quality. It feels like it's made from recycled plastic bags. It was 3.99 when I bought it and it feels like 3.99.
1.0,"I tried sleeping in this and I found it to be very uncomfortable. So I put it away for a couple weeks before trying it again. No luck - it just doesn’t hang right, as if the fabric is twisted. Even worse, the sleeves are very narrow. They bind the upper arm, actually pinching around the armpit when you’re lying down - which makes sleeping uncomfortable.<br /><br />I have another one of these in the same size from the same vendor and it fits fine. The sleeves on the other one are noticeably wider and it is comfortable to sleep in. It’s really odd that one fits and the other doesn’t."
1.0,Did not support me the way I would have liked it to.
1.0,These are huge facemasks!
1.0,This top was very boxy on me and the fabric was stiff cotton. I’m not sure washing it would have softened it up either. Ended up returning.
1.0,The frame on the glasses broke on second day I wore them.  Very disappointed
1.0,"For starters, as soon as mine came in two of them were already broken. And the other ones that weren’t all broke once I put them into my crocs. Read the comments and do not buy this product!"
1.0,This looked like it came out of a gumball Machine
1.0,"JUST A PIECE OF MATERIAL ONLY. NO HEM, NOTHING."
1.0,"No support. Does not fit! If you have large breasts, or anything beyond a B cup ...Keep looking!"
1.0,tarnish after a few uses
1.0,This shirt is nothing like the picture at all. It is a thick fabric and the neck is way smaller than in the picture!
1.0,Very frustrated. The product description says that the necklace is gold but I received it in silver. Will be returning immediately.
1.0,"Listing was for two, only one came."
1.0,"Lo compre pensando q era hermoso y se quebró, no lo compré pésimo material"
1.0,They fall off ears easily.
1.0,The are very nice shoes. However they are advertised as slip-ons and they are not. They fit perfectly but had to use a shoe horn to get them on without breaking down the backs.
1.0,"This draft board is terrible. I've never purchased a draft board that was missing the labels for so many key players and had the labels for players no longer in the league. Ex: no Spencer Ware, but it had Ray Rice--smh. It was so bad at one point we had to check to see if there were sheets we never got out of the packaging. I find this unacceptable for an &#34;Officially Licenced&#34; NFL product that costs almost 2x the amount as the avg. draft board. Spend your money elsewhere."
1.0,The size was XL but it was more like medium did not fit at all
1.0,"Pants way too tight, blew out the crotch trying on. With those useless and in the garbage, tried the jacket on. Fat guy in a little coat. Ripped putting it on.<br /><br />The tie is not worth keeping, either.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board for my MIB costume, this one is going on the garbage."
1.0,"This coat would be great but it’s not sized right<br />Sent back, cannot use"
1.0,THEY DON'T FIT!
1.0,Sent it back. Awful quality for under armour. Very thin materiel and small.
1.0,Cheap material. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"I give up trying to buy tapers in 1/2"" (12mm).  This is getting ridiculous.  I wear 7/16 (11mm).<br />These are not 1/2"".  they are 11.25 mm.  Are you freaking kidding me? The tapers fit inside my 1/2"" tunnels.  The tunnels that came with this are 11mm.  The same size I'm already at."
1.0,Must have misunderstood the review for the socks. Was looking for work sock and these are very thin and not suitable for work.
1.0,"Beautiful but very cheaply made. Several Rhinestones had already come off before I even opened the package. I tried to super-glue them back on but while I was doing that, several others came off. These earrings are now in the garbage."
1.0,I’ve order these shirts twice and the white shirt on both orders had a large stain on the front.
1.0,These sunglasses are neat but the lenses are hyyyuge so they look quite redic
1.0,"When trying it on, it felt great. But while I had it on to try out, it become very stretched out. Not a fan. Returned it."
1.0,Worst purchase ever!!!
1.0,"Bought this so I could stop using trash bags. With the bags I usually come back dripping sweat and with this, I was basically dry when I took it off. Also hard and confusing to put on."
1.0,It says tight fit and it was approx 3 sizes too large . Pants are see through
1.0,It does not fit flush to my ears and looks plain stupid!  Waste of money
1.0,Hola me disen que mi paquete fue entregado ayer pero yo no he recibido este paquete
1.0,Very difficult to adjust through the loop. Returning immediately!
1.0,"Item defective, one sleeve smaller than the other, material is cheap quality, HOLE on one side NOT SEWN TOGETHER !! CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP quality !!! Strings hanging everywhere. VERY DISAPPOINTED"
1.0,Didn't work as described.
1.0,I hate this thing the black one broke when i tryed piting it on so i had to try my best to fix it with som supper glue.the brown one seems perf.!
1.0,I wish I could give these a 0 because my son never wore them. They look exactly like the picture but literally pop off of his feet which blows my mind because the actual bottom of the shoe is too big. Plus they aren’t even wide enough for a real foot.
1.0,The top overall is very fitted and not an oversized contemporary tank as pictured. The tops is also shorter than pictured and the fabric is poor quality. The tie dying is actually a poorly done print.
1.0,One earring broke the first time I tried to put it on. It just broke into two pieces. I will be sending it back to Amazon. I am disappointed because I did like the look of it. I don't think I want to try a replacement; I suspect the same breakage would happen again.
1.0,"Very strange fit.  I normally wear a medium top, occasionally a small depending upon the style.  Ordered a large and it fit like an American xsmall. The vendor sent another top in an extra large and it fit smaller than the first one!  I ended up donating them."
1.0,Our daughter bought this as a gift for me for Christmas with her allowance money. Because it has Pandora charms under it she believed it was a REAL pandora charm. DO NOT BE FOOLED!! It turned in less than a month! She was so upset. Save your money and when possible buy the real thing
1.0,Coating began peeling off at edges less than 1 month after purchase.  The lenses are now useless.  Do not buy.
1.0,"Terrible, I didn't even recieve the shirt it the picture. It was a long dress that looked more like a moo moo."
1.0,Poorly made. Weird fit. I would not recommend to anyone even those looking for a simple sweater. I wouldn’t wear or regift to anyone.
1.0,Gonna give it away..way too short..too wide.. straps don't adjust correctly
1.0,"Very thin material. I always wear XL, and that is what this is marked, however it is obviously too small for me, so the size is mismarked. Unfortunately I didn't try it on until several months after I purchased it, so I'm stuck with it."
1.0,"Terrible product. Material felt like wearing a legging on your arm. After one wash, the seam has already been tear. Do not buy. Worth 1 penny. Cheap product from China!"
1.0,Horrible horrible horrible ordered 2 pairs of sneakers and they were both the wrong size
1.0,So BIG!!!! 😐🤦🏽‍♀️ I bought size M and was like extra large
1.0,"The glasses as far as fashion is concerned are super cute totally unisex. There is a crazy strong plastic smell that still has yet to go away and they have been ""aired out"" for 3 weeks.<br />I specifically purchased these because I was looking for Polarized sunglasses so I could see better in the sun, these did not help with that, I'm still squinting as if I had my normal prescription glasses on with no UV protection.<br />Bummed because I love the style"
1.0,"So it is basically just a cheaper end tee shirt with cut sleeves. I wasn't at all impressed by the quality at all but what made me return it was the length.<br /><br />I am not into the short shirts showing off the ugly jeans look.<br />In one picture this shirt shows that is is fairly long and that the only reason it looks short in the 1st picture is because it is tucked in. Sadly is about 3-4 inches shorter and fits like the 1st picture without it being tucked in which was uncool.<br /><br />It is slightly see through and I really didn't want to layer.<br /><br />Go to walmart, find a $5 tee shirt, tie dye it and cut the sleeves and make your own. It will be cheaper, fun to make, and a lot better quality. Or better yet leave the tie dye in the 60s."
1.0,"All this is a hunk of nylon fabric that goes over your head. Do not buy this ,it is a total ripoff."
1.0,No es para nada seguro.
1.0,Did not fit the frames properly.
1.0,If I would have know this was going to make breathing even worse from being so tight i would not have spent my money on it. Yes I know to be effective it needs to be a little tight but it feels like someone is pushing there hand on my face and not in a gentle way.
1.0,It doesn't add any support and makes your boobs sweaty. I wore it for my wedding and was sadly let down.
1.0,Did not sit on the face correctly.  Sent it back.
1.0,Ordered a5x package said it was a 5x. The top was maybe a large and the skirt an xl.. Gave it to granddaughter.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheap metal.
1.0,I was so excited to get this shirt to wear to my class reunion as it looked so fun. When I got it it was missing part of the shoulder? Defective so I need to send back.... bummed.
1.0,Was like 10-15cent item from<br />China ....threw it in trash on spot to punish myself for being dumb enough to trust
1.0,Cup very small
1.0,"It says it fits a seven year old this jersey was a great fit for my one year definitely not for a 7 year old. Adjustments need to be made to the sizing choice, very disappointed"
1.0,"The picture and description clearly stated sparkly, which is WHY i got them. Very disappointed in this purchase as they just have plain white star design and no actual sparkle or glitter on them."
1.0,Everything you read about the shoes being hard and painful is all true! When I wear them for any period of time I feel the pain the most after I take them off and realize the sore spots on my feet. I would totally not recommend these to anyone!! I wish I had read the reviews first I would never have bought them in the first place!!! Totally waste of money!
1.0,The underwire cut into my breast and rib cage
1.0,Bought these in April.  Didn’t have the opportunity to wear them til Janine. After only a few wearings the sole cam apart from the insole almost causing a fall.  Comfort was great but not worth it.
1.0,Grommets came out of belt in a little over one month of use.  Only wore this about 4 times.
1.0,I ordered an extra large and it was more like an extra small. I have someone at work that weighs about 100 pounds and it was even a little tight on her but I went ahead and gave the skirt to her.
1.0,This mask was heavy and I kept needing to readjust the mask over my nose. But it looks great.
1.0,"Worn once. Tons of snags, a hole, no quality"
1.0,These shoes split on the sole after one month. Don't waste your money on them
1.0,I bought this and installed it on my watch and about 2 days into wearing it the glitter cloth came unglued from the actual band and fell off! Cheap and poor craftsmanship and for paying almost $20 I really would have expected better. I'm so DISAPPOINTED! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,Not impressed. Very cheaply made. This is what it looked like straight out of packaging. Kinda upset bc I bought 2 and I wish I would have waited to see what my first one looked like. Hopefully when it arrives it won't be as bad. Will not purchase again
1.0,"These are the worst shirts ever. I ordered large, the package says large, and the tag says large. However, each shirt is a different size. Also, they are sewn incorrectly. For a couple of the shirts, one sleeve is considerably longer than the other. Also, I washed them once as soon as I got them (which was a mistake, now I can't return) and the threads are already pulling out.<br />If you buy these, thoroughly inspect each shirt before you wash them."
1.0,The hardware is cheap and poorly designed. The metal clips can twist and the straps pop off which means disrobing to straighten the mess. The concept is sound but needs an improved hardware system.
1.0,This is horrible on so many levels
1.0,Came with glue all over the case.  There were only only lens and not four.  I'm sure these were a return and they never checked the contents before they came back.  I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,"The hat arrived in a damaged box; therefore, the hat was bent. The color of the hat is more of a white color rather than gray​. It was not what I expected!!"
1.0,The entire thing barely even reaches 19 in (47.5 cm) and the chain came knotted up from very poor packaging.
1.0,And very complicated. Not very comfortable.
1.0,Supposed to be xlarge
1.0,"I’m sending it back for multiple reason. I wanted it to be large to wear with leggings so I order a l/xl and received the medium. The sweater is not what is pictured, I’m 5’5” with short arms and the sleeves do not even hit my wrists. It’s about 6” shorter than what is shown. The neck is crew and not wide like pictured. The stitching is really odd and puckered. Lastly the material feels like a heavy tight material. Overall it looks like a weird little box with odd material and super cheaply made. I wouldn’t have taken this for free."
1.0,Es muy  corriente no tiene nada de calidad en el producto.
1.0,The lenses are totally cute but these sunglasses are so cheaply made. They feel like they could just snap in two with a gust of wind lol too bad I really love the colors in the lenses. I've bought sunglasses for less money that were way better and more durable
1.0,The color bled into the white. I recommend dry clean only
1.0,Did not like at all!!! I only had maybe a week before it started unraveling in the seems. I was very disappointed!!
1.0,Not what I expected and just didn't like the material.
1.0,I've ordered this twice after first watch Analog dials were not accurate very slow. Received replacement and the same defect.. Don't waste your time with this YFWOOD watch..
1.0,He hates them. They are .ot a boxer cut. Into the trash they went
1.0,Either return my money or send me a new one the package was way to big &amp; it was slit open on the side &amp; the nose stud wasn't in it
1.0,This wallet was advertized as blocking RFID--the very reason why I bought it. It does not work. I tested it and it failed. I put the card that I used in this wallet in a different RFID blocking wallet and that one worked. Highly disappointed.
1.0,After 1 week of regular wear it rusted to a nasty dark brown.
1.0,"took forever to get here and then it was 1"" short"
1.0,Horrible quality and cheap !
1.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap—it’s irresponsible to sell these masks as they in no way offer any sort of protection, coronavirus or otherwise."
1.0,i am not very happy with the product i receive and i not advice anybody to buy that terrible product
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it. CHEAP!!
1.0,It broke after one use.
1.0,Bought these for Christmas for my daughter. They are already brown or bronze.
1.0,This ring was totally misleading is supposed to be Sapphire and it is more like a blue amethyst type color nothing that says it's a sapphire Sapphire is a deep blue like in the picture and this is not
1.0,"I did get what I wanted and it was sealed perfectly but had a bit of melted blue gummy gunk on it. I will try for an exchange, I will update afterwards."
1.0,Very cheaply made. The desciption say they are metal but they are not. They're completly made of plastic and very flimsy. I returned mine fore refund.
1.0,Tarnished almost immediately
1.0,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this scarf. The colors are not nearly as vivid as they are in the picture, and the material is VERY thin to the point that it is seethrough."
1.0,"Went to put on for the first time and the zipper came off the ‘rails’. Since the zipper doesn’t work, it wont hold air."
1.0,No label nor description about UV protection.. looks non-standard
1.0,"I guess I should expect too much, but one of the masks was missing the cushion for your forehead and the other had messed up LEDs."
1.0,"I ordered this jacket in a 4xl for my husband.  It barel6 fits my size 4 daughter.  When I attempted to return it, I realized that I am responsible for all return costs.  Do NOT purchase this if you are unsure of size!"
1.0,Not a very good quality. The latch won't catch to go up all the way and doesn't easily fold back up. Pretty disappointed and definitely not kid friendly
1.0,bad fit not enough sizes
1.0,"I didn’t care for this set because the earrings and necklace were too small, as the picture was enhanced. I have returned these."
1.0,I had high hopes for this dress. The material was a soft linen and it was lined however the color is baby blue not denim looking. The buttons barely fit through the holes. There were strings hanging off of the arms and all in all it looked like a nurses uniform. Possibly much cuter in navy or black. I ordered the large because i have a big bust but the fit around the shoulders was odd. Had to return.
1.0,Cheap plastic earrings! Way to small do not buy!
1.0,Belt last only a month and a half before it broke!
1.0,It’s so bad- it went back. It looked like it came from the Dollar store on the children’s rack. Plastic looking- quite gaudy and cheap looking.
1.0,"Short in the torso, making it uncomfortable and revealing."
1.0,"The fabric is very soft, but if you have any curves these are difficult to wear."
1.0,There is a zipper in the back there should be no zipper based on customer review pictures it could have been cute as basic T-shirt pull over but it was not. I should have taken a picture the zipper was nice one but it was said to have one the description I first read
1.0,"The first day I wore it my wrist turned green immediately.  Before writing this review I checked the type of metal used in making the bracelet.  I had wrongly assumed it was sterling silver.  The bracelet is made from an 'alloy' metal.  My sensitive skin only turns green from cheap metal ie not silver or gold,  For the price sterling silver is not and unreasonable since the rest is just glass.  I should have read the metal before I bought but I let the 5 star reviews be my guide.  Reviews sway me more than any advertising or marketing ploy.  in closing , the glass is a beautiful green and it almost matches the color of my wrist  as I mentioned before,"
1.0,The pants didn’t look anything like the picture. They had a drawstring and the pockets were different and absolutely super see through
1.0,I nearly died when I seen the very small flimsy chain that should of been 20$ a put it around my baby’s wrist !!!!
1.0,"do not buy this I coulda gave a quarter and I gamble machine and got a better product it broke immediately after taking it out of the package,so I got a hold of the person who sent it they sent another one big deal was broke before I took it out of the package a big let down if you ask me don't waste your time or money"
1.0,Too large for an L-Size comparing other branded items.<br /><br />Waiting for a refund.
1.0,"Right out of box one rotor is constantly running even when unit is turned off.  Tossed the box so I'm out of luck, must be the Irish in me."
1.0,"Ordered the two tone blue, picture shows silver buckle but received one with a blue buckle. I might not care if the blue matched the band, but it was a completely different blue. Also, the watch face case was clear while picture shows blue."
1.0,Broke minutes after opening (Middle stone fell out).
1.0,It was enormous and looked like it was already used.
1.0,Way too small sent it back. I wear a medium bought an XL and it won't go past my lower thigh not sure who this is made for but definitely not women.
1.0,"Cheap material, cheaply made. Lately a lot of stuff I order is very poor quality. I'm returning it"
1.0,The item was very cheap looking and not made very well.  It doesn’t look like the same as in the picture.
1.0,"It was too small, could barely get it over my hand and I don’t have large hands. Also on the heavy side."
1.0,They do not look like that. Very poorly made!!!!!!
1.0,Bought this pajama set to wear during my stay in the hospital when having my daughter. I didn't get them out until at the hospital and there is a hole in the pants! It's now too late to return so I'm stuck with them.
1.0,The item photo has a more detailed band. The one that arrived was plain.
1.0,"I bought two. First one broke in less than a week. Second one had a blood stain? Some rusty stain I cannot get rid of after spot washing. Quality is extremely low. Like those cheap Chinese umbrellas you buy at dollar-store. The only difference is the price. At dollar-stores you pay couple of bucks for them. Here, they charge nearly 20. I would not buy them again. If I had time I would return these back. Just don't want to deal with the hassle returning them. I will use the second one, it more likely breaks fast and then I will bu something better."
1.0,I ordered a 4XL - it is more like a 3XL. The fabric is very thin and it looks more like a women's shirt than a men's. I returned them.
1.0,"I didn't even unwrap these as they were different from what appeared in the picture. I ordered the black pair and their have a thick, rope for the drawstring. The rope is the typical off-white rope color. I'd say about a centimeter in diameter. Definitely not something you'd want to walk around in public with."
1.0,I am normally a xl ordered a 2x it fits like a medium returning
1.0,"Very, very disappointed and upset! They are not as shown in the picture at all! Very deceitful! The ones that were sent to me are not even scalloped around the edge like it shows in the picture which is what drew me to buy them. They are very plain, ribbed and thin. I haven't even worn them and when I tried them on there is string coming out around the thumb hole already. Shame on Allegra K."
1.0,"This product is stretchy and looks like the photo BUT is so thin you can see everything through the material. Everything meaning EVERYTHING, wether you have on under garments or not. Skip this one. Not worth it. I gave it to my son for dress up."
1.0,One of the worst buys I’ve ever had. The skirt was sent to me with a broken zipper. I didn’t realize this till I tried it on. The zipper didn’t have the actual piece that holds the skirt together that you can pull up and down on. I took a closer inspection and there were white marks all over the skirt.
1.0,Did do what instuctions indicate....  just will not keep bubbles from forming?<br /><br />Going to stick to safety glassed that have bifocal already installed.
1.0,"I was not able to wear the earrings because the part that goes in the piercing was bent, loose and very cheap. Very disappointed."
1.0,Didn't fit anyone in my family but my 8yr old son and he could only get them to the elbow.
1.0,Broke and couldn’t get a refund due to COVID returns
1.0,Lose elasticity during the day.
1.0,Too small expected them to be small in little girls but they ended up fitting my 2 year old
1.0,"Broken item sent, not worth the hassle ..... No quality control"
1.0,"The seller Istasgy Never sent my products.. don’t order anything from Istasgy.. This mask never came!! For sure did not come for Halloween. It’s almost December and this still has not come, I ordered it in September.. man waste of time and money!!"
1.0,I use it for my phone and it broke after 2 months. I hope that they will change it for me
1.0,We were pleased with the purchase for the first week. The sun faded it so much they look like they are twenty years old. A huge disappointment not to mention the complaints at the pool by the residents.
1.0,Please beware. Made in China and polyester. Will not be good for the hair.
1.0,The second hand only moves back and forth unless I flick it then sometimes it will make it around.
1.0,"YUCK...I didnt even bother trying it on. The fabric was extremely cheap, might as well consider a poorly made halloween costume instead."
1.0,Waste of money :(<br />Stones fell out while wearing the first time.
1.0,This is considered a “ female dot”. Subjective to standard.
1.0,Ordered this for a costume and regret it. Its horrible and don't waste your money on it. The &#34;fur&#34; is so sparse and it didn't fit despite the description say its for an adult. Don't waste your money ordering this. Wish I could return it for a refund
1.0,"Small!!! Small!!!! Small!!! I wear a XL and this is certainly not a XL. Very disappointed. The fabric isn't great either, but you get what you pay for, right? Never again."
1.0,received one earring  broken / unable to use
1.0,they are very unconfortable
1.0,Not at all what is shown here. Color is plain and bland. Disappointed.
1.0,It broke a week after I got it. Waste of money. Cheap.
1.0,It is too big and it to much of a hassle to return I like talking to a live person not a computer
1.0,The stripes are pink can’t expect the best from China 🤮
1.0,I couldn't wear it for very long.  Could not breathe.
1.0,Way too small despite following all measurements and recommendations by other buyers. I guess I'm just too plump...
1.0,The decal on the mask melted in cold water when it was washed
1.0,Fake sunglasses do not buy
1.0,Got this as a gift for my friend and it turned her finger green. Pretty sure the description said “stainless steel” which should have not done that.
1.0,The coloring between the greens does not go together at all. The material of the floral portion is that clingy pajama material. Do not recommend.
1.0,"These pants fit well according to the size chart, which was a size smaller than I normally wear. I wore them one time, really liked them, cool enough but not see through. Then I washed them in COLD water, DID NOT DRY them and they shrunk about 4 inches. Now it’s too late to return them! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!"
1.0,Description stated 3 pairs (6 pieces) and I only 1 of each color (3 pieces).  I will not by again since it would might just prolong if I need to return again. Need them for work so it would have been nice to have them now.
1.0,"These were not the stated materials, these feel like nylon or plastic"
1.0,The quality of the leather is poor and the fit is horrible
1.0,"No es el tamaño adecuado, en la búsqueda dice que es un Jersey para hombre y la talla no corresponde, deben ESPECIFICAR que es ropa de niño"
1.0,"I had not worn it for more than five minutes and the clasp came undone, I was able to  put it back in, and a few minutes later it came undone again.  Cheap"
1.0,Dislike still very hard to get on for seniors would not buy again u make it sound as though ur product is easier then others they r not
1.0,I like it came on time and not too late n dislike my package was left by the stairs instead at my front door I gladly would appreciate for more customer  purchases have a blessed  n productive an peaceful  evening
1.0,nice image and colors but the image peels after each washing.
1.0,Not happy at all. Very cheaply made producct
1.0,It looked good out the packaging washed it one time in cold water gentle and now it looks ash black such a disappointment!!
1.0,I think I wrote one other 1 star review out of all my purchases with Amazon. Right out of the bag you can feel the paper thin “denim” of these shorts. The fastening button is going to fall off at any time - cheaply put together.
1.0,"Not what I expected at all.  Not well made, ugly fabric"
1.0,Melted in 30 seconds .. then tried less temp.. melted just the same .. I will however start reading reviews before purchasing.. DO NOT BUY IF YOUR USING FOR SUBLIMATION
1.0,Piece of junk. Threw away.Very much not as described.
1.0,Gave it to best friend who's several sizes smaller and even she couldn't fit into it.
1.0,Blurred my vision all but right in the middle.
1.0,Too cheap. Material is not what I expected. Returned.
1.0,Way to small.  Tiny tiny tiny..
1.0,10 red foam noses - I’m going to use them glued to a reindeer at Christmas.  They will look okay from a distance.  They cannot be used as clown noses because they do not expand/inflate.  They stay flat and misshapen.  JUNK!
1.0,"I wasn’t expecting a lot when I purchased this item, considering the price. But I was surprised at how cheap this jacket looked. I often wear sleeveless dresses in warm weather, and just wanted something to put on in my office when the A/C is too high. But this jacket reminds me of the cape I put on at the salon when I get my hair done, or something an employee of a big-box store might wear as a uniform. It’s that same shiny, plasticy material."
1.0,Not only to small but the material does not look as how you would think for this pattern. It was like a polyester tshirt matetial. Also was very short.
1.0,Was not becoming as it sat up on my head due to its fit and I have an average size head
1.0,It is clearly not the item in the picture.  It is way to small and wouldn't cover up anyone other than a very small child.
1.0,"Only got one headband, not for pet either which is what I wanted."
1.0,It was damaged and made my skin turn black when I wore it. Didn’t feel nice either.
1.0,I purchased these because for at least 6 years I've work Body Glove low-rise briefs which are no longer available. I found these because they looked exactly the same came in the same 6 pack in the exact same packaging (like exactly the same) so I figured they were likely the same underwear with a different label. Wrong! These are so terribly thin they are see through! I attached a picture of the darkest color green and you can still see my hand through them. Just terrible!!
1.0,The fabric is ridiculously terrible. Comes super wrinkled and would be difficult to iron due to the type of fabric. I’d ordered this thinking it was an actual wrap dress. It’s not. There’s a zipper in the back and the tie is just for the top and mainly just for looks - doesn’t allow for adjustment of fit. Sending this back for sure.
1.0,Read so many reviews prior to purchasing and still wanted to try. The fabric was a bad as others explained and it’s much shorter than I excepted. I am a size 6 and ordered a medium but it was too large on top but tight on the bottom. Just over all poorly made. I would skip on this one.
1.0,Stone fell out after one day of wearing it
1.0,When I received them they were broken
1.0,The hat doesn’t pair up with my phone I have IPhone11 so it will be returned
1.0,JUNK DO NOT BUY
1.0,Awful scratchy material. Looks nothing like the picture. I'll fitting. Terrible quality. Amazon shouldn't sell clothing of such poor quality
1.0,This don't even deserve a star the quality poor not satisfied at all this just is cheap looking not like the pic they are smart the only how you can see the slit you have to pull it apart very disappointed.....DONT BOTHER TO BUY
1.0,The size is good but a real cloth is so UGLY. The lace is looks lile my grandma tablecloth😂 Please change the picture.
1.0,"I normally wear a sixe large,  I ordered this in an xxl and still to small. Paper thin and see through.  I git the black and dark blue. Not recommended."
1.0,this thing is really cheap it broke after 2 weeks
1.0,"The style was reasonable, the fabric was thin and not durable"
1.0,"Poor quality, see through"
1.0,The magnet is strong enough for a less expensive hat. I have an expensive raffia hat that is too thick for the magnet. So far I’ve only found one hat that the magnet is strong enough to hold.
1.0,"Not at all what it shoes, the fabric and picture I have used it to sleep"
1.0,Loved it. Just a bit too long for the tragus.<br /><br />Update: stud turned black after 1 month.
1.0,No poor material
1.0,Too small. Not much direction on how to mold. The molding process did not work. Completely ruined the grills.
1.0,Took it out of the box and the hearts all came apart from that hole they all are supposed to stay out off. I was so excited because the look is nice.
1.0,"When I first received it, I thought they sent me the wring size. But I checked and it was indeed a XL. Someone wrote on one of the reviews &#34;don't waist your money&#34; I wish I would have listened. I'm a 34C and there was no way the tiny top was gonna fit my chest. I only give it one star, because it did arrive relatively early. If I could give it zero stars I would, but like I said it did arrive eat which is reserving of 1 star. I was very much looking forward to getting it in the mail, but was extremely disappointed once I did! Don't bother if u have a bigger chest, because the sizes just don't match!"
1.0,My 6 year old granddaughter can wear this and I ordered a 3x. There is no way it was going to fit me. Not happy with this purchase.
1.0,"Looks cheap, terrible  the way was shipped  in a bag all broken pieces don't waste your money looks like something  from the dollar  store."
1.0,Wrong length delivered! The shoe laces that came were like twice the size it said on the package which stated 36&#34;. It wasn't worth it to even bother returning them. Perhaps I will own some taller boots in the future that they would work with... But they will most likely just live forever in a drawer.
1.0,This necklace is very thin and fragile.
1.0,"I am so disappointed with this. It was supposed to be a gift for a friend, and because of the poor packaging I can’t even gift it. It was exposed through the package and ruined! So frustrated."
1.0,"Just received mine in the mail. I like the top it's a little small, but the bottoms are so awkward. Like sumo wrestler diaper style. Long and narrow, not good if you have a big butt. Wouldn't recommend."
1.0,it look nice on the computer but not in person
1.0,Not a good dress. I'm not impressed:(
1.0,"Smoothly nice fabric. Nevertheless straps too short and tight even fully extended. I am normally a 32B and might appreciate light padding, but this bra is much padded than I expected. I returned it and got the refund almost immediately, so as for customer service, it was excellent."
1.0,This is really weird. The fabric is ridiculously staticy and it hits at the weirdest length.
1.0,Not what I wanted. Silky polyester. YUCK! returned it. Zero stars.
1.0,"Today is New Year's Eve! These duck slippers lasted from Christmas day until today before they fell apart, so should one be grateful that they did not fall apart on the same day, or waited a week before falling apart?  However, the granddaughter that received them loves ducks and wants another pair...of course she will receive them since she loves ducks and I love my grandchildren!  Talk about &#34;planned obsolescence&#34;!"
1.0,These are uncorrectly marketed as kids size they are too big for kids.
1.0,To big for kids. Hard to breathe though.
1.0,What a burn. They took forever to arrive. I ordered 200 of the masks and received 34. Not individually wrapped as advertised. I'm furious. Not sure about sheerness or thickness but very certainly not a value for the money.
1.0,"Cute glasses, too large for my face."
1.0,"I purchased this based on the photo but the shade of green that arrived is a bright, gaudy green- garden hose shade. The plastic green strip has bare, exposed ends that stick out from under some green twine wrapped around it to hold it to the strap. I have ordered this in a different color before and that was much nicer and made with attention to detail.<br />My 3 year old granddaughter could do a better job of this!<br />It was very inexpensive to be sure, but not even worth a fraction of what I paid. Plus, it was shipped from China so good luck with getting a refund!"
1.0,There wasn't any packing slip. And the bras we're just weird. They felt like I was wearing a rug. Not comfortable at all.
1.0,"I ordered this necklace for my daughter expecting it to be small and what the photo shows on the ladys neck, but it was massive."
1.0,Shirt had no washing instructions. It shrunk and looks horrible!
1.0,"I'm very disappointed in this product, it is not at all like the description,  not sparkly or shimmering at its like a marbled pink color"
1.0,"Ordered this and I got sent a sisters bracelet, therefore I didn't have an appropriate birthday gift. Needless to say I'm returning it. Poor quality even though it was the wrong one."
1.0,Don't get deceived by the picture. I have ordered 3 sets but all came with defects - either not closing or not able to open. Unable to use all three sets. Sent a message to seller but awaiting their resposne.
1.0,My 9 year old has just begun to need something under her shirts. I wanted to find something similar to a tank top. I like the material of these. They're thick and not see through. However my daughter immediately hated these. They run small and the side seams are so thick that they poked her underarms and hurt. We had to return.
1.0,This runs extremely small. I would size up two sizes to be comfortable enough to sleep. I ordered a xxl and it fits more like a medium or large. The neck seems a little stiff but the rest of the fabric is soft.
1.0,The ring sat in the box since I bought it. I purchased it for my wife for Christmas. It was only a couple weeks old and it corroded so bad. They offered a full refund for the ring but very bad quality for the price. Bought cheaper rings for outings for my wife that we’re better quality that never corroded.
1.0,These suck the things don’t even unscrew to put in
1.0,"False item description! I went to the Pearl Source website to look these up and get additional pictures. The website says these are 14k gold PLATED, NOT 14k solid gold. False, deceiving, advertising!"
1.0,This bag is nice looking and spacious but poorly made. Zipper broke after 1 week and the lining inside the front pocket lost the stitches in a corner causing all content to spill between bag and lining. Not recommended if you need a bag you can actually use day to day.
1.0,If you have any curves it will cling to them. I ended up returning it.
1.0,When I received my necklace in the mail it was broken. the leave was not attached to the necklace and the chain was broken.
1.0,"It's really slippery like nylon or something.  It is so wrinkled when you take it out of the bag, it gives you an idea what it will be when you wear it.  Just awful!!!  I'm getting a refund."
1.0,"Did not get the product that was advertised originally. I had ordered the all red brooch and instead got a pink and red one. Not worth the trouble to return to China, from where it was shipped."
1.0,Very cheap material and look. I didn't dare wearing it in public
1.0,Did not fit true to size. And roe box is narrow
1.0,Mine broke after two days. It was a gift from my daughter for Christmas.
1.0,Horrible only wear 1x bought 5x still to small looks super cheaply made
1.0,First wash made material look extremely worn.
1.0,"The clasp was deformed, cannot be repaired.  So lovely, but it will not ever be worn.  No since returning, was wast of time, effort and small amount of money.  Could only have been worn a few times. So no more!"
1.0,I ordered two bow ties. Both came in different brands and different colors. Very unexpectable.
1.0,It is ugly?
1.0,"It was delivered balled up wasn't wearable, very disappointed"
1.0,Bought this a little bigger than what I wear n in long. I got the jeans and I could not fit the pants I was so upset. I just gave them away
1.0,"Well, I only wore this sweater for 2 hours one time. The 2nd time I put it on before I went downstairs to perform on stage with my band and 20 minutes after the set started, someone pointed out that the neck portion of the sweater look like it was detaching and my chest was exposed.  I was absolutely horrified as I had another 2 hours before it could be excused to go purchase another shirt at one of the gift shops.  So then I wanted to return it and it said that the return window closed.  When I wash my items I always have them on low spin and very small wash loads. I do not have a center agitator inside of the washing machine and when I washed this sweater I only had three other sweaters in the load. Don't like being humiliated in public especially in front of hundreds of people.  So I went to look at the green one which I have not worn yet and that one is also detached. Don't like throwing $45 in the trash."
1.0,Cheap quality. Ok for a themed party but not really worth much more than that.
1.0,"The dress is for my daughter.  It arrived with light stain spots in quite a few places.  We thought washing would remove them, but it did not.  One of the straps was not properly attached and pulled loose before she ever wore the dress."
1.0,I bought this belt 6/20/16. The belt already split apart. Very poorly made!!!
1.0,Take a pass.  Look faded and feel terrible.
1.0,"For 75 + tax, about 80 dollars, you can do so much better.  Keep in mind this thing has no lining to make it more comfortable.  Also it is breathable so it won't really keep you warm for better or for worse.  I'm not saying this is the worst jacket in the world, but I am saying it's nowhere near worth it for the price.  Also note, I went out and bought a couple jackets from Columbia, for 60 and 100 dollars (on sale, supposedly)...suffice it to say even the 60 dollar columbia jacket will almost surely be better than this for 80."
1.0,"If there was a rating for zero stars, I would rate these gloves ZERO. They are not Thinsulate, they are not wool. They look like something worth two dollars from a flea market.  they are going back. A definite rip off!  I hate when companies misrepresent their products in the hopes that a dissatisfied customer will not return their products. Shame on Amazon.  The picture will show you exactly what you get for 16 bucks."
1.0,This is what happened the first time I put them on. What a disappointment! Save your money!!!
1.0,"Poor product. You get XXL when you choose M. Not once, it happened twice. You ask them to replace and they will ask you to return. Is this a joke?"
1.0,"Items have been returned.<br />1). I ordered it for Christmas, but it arrived five days after Christmas;<br />2). the squared double sewn is very uncomfortable;<br />3). the material is too shining after it stretches."
1.0,Dress looks completely different than picture and did not come with the belt that clearly says “included” in the description! VERY DISAPPOINTED
1.0,"These shoes are super cute, the color is great and I couldn't wait to wear them. The issues I am experiencing are with the size and sole of the shoe. The size is ok, but these run wide and are just getting wider with each time I wear them. The other issue is the footbed sole, it's basically rubber, so if you perspire at all, and or have damp feet forget about it. These shoes will have your feet slipping and sliding in no time. The material is definitely synthetic."
1.0,Not what I expectect
1.0,"We may have just rec'd a defective shoe, but my 9-year-old son wore these for less than three months and the sole was coming off. The fabric connecting the sole wasn't sturdy enough to re-glue it, and he actually wound up with holes straight through to his feet. We're Nike fans, but this quality was a disappointment."
1.0,My baby’s head usually swims in hats but this one is teeny. Wasted purchase
1.0,I normally wear a xl but because the ad said it runs small to size I ordered a 2xl and couldnt even fit over my shoulders. It was a joke this wouldnt even fit medium size person.
1.0,This is a beautiful dress. Once you lace it up tighten up for your waist in the neck is way too big and no way to adjust it.
1.0,Pretty but the magnets aren’t strong enough. Move your hand too far and it flies off :-(
1.0,"I purchased this as a last minute gift for my friend. I know I should have read the reviews like I always do but didn't and now I'm stuck with a shirt that looks disgraceful and completely not what I was looking for.<br /><br />Honestly it belongs on one of those comparison websites that shows what you think you're getting to what you got.  My friend is tiny... This &#34;small&#34; shirt drapes on me like a trash bag (not that I'm huge,  but I don't where a ladies small).  It's also not as long as depicted and the color isn't the same purple either.<br /><br />Don't get this shirt. I repeat,  DON'T. SAVE YOUR MONEY.  I wish I had because now I have 9 days until Christmas and a swath of fabric no one wants to wear."
1.0,"The yoga waist though pretty is a thin polyester material that provides no support. I wore the yoga pants half a day, pulling them up every 15 minutes, until I finally gave up. Washed and sent them on to Goodwill to aggravate some other poor soul!  It's too bad, the rest of the pant material and fit was fine, but without a decent waist band they constantly slide down."
1.0,It broke the first day my daughter carried it..she was really excited to get it too
1.0,"It was comfortable to wear, but after a couple weeks it completely broke when the metal piece that goes through the holes ripped it open. I couldn't wear it after that"
1.0,I am returning it. The size is way too small. I ordered a large and received an extra small. The tag  says large.
1.0,"Very disappointed with the items I received.  Description says 100 percent silk and I received some kind of cotton panties. Not even close to what I expected judging by the picture and text.  Colors do not even match what was shown and the size I ordered, XXL was delivered as a L."
1.0,"See through , porous fabric. It is cute, but does not accomplish the purpose of a mask."
1.0,"This watch looks really nice and appears just as it does in the images. However, it’s seemingly impossible to remove links from the watch. Myself and others have attempted numerous times and haven’t been able to loosen the links to remove them. It’s disappointing because it looks very nice, but is so loose it’s not functional to wear. If a jeweler can’t remove the links I’ll be returning it."
1.0,Nice idea but the strap is way too long and it kept hitting on things.  Disappointed in it.
1.0,Very cute earrings.<br />Wore them almost everyday until the post came off the earring. I asked for a replacement and I received it quickly.<br />Same thing happened again- the post came off the earring.<br />Sending back & will order another brand.
1.0,"Seems nice quality,  but it's loose. Thought some big head tried it on. I have small asian face. But, will try other color and style hoping this time NO ONE tried it!!"
1.0,"Cheaply produced, tacky- not a high class product. Waste of money- wont be wearing them."
1.0,Cheap. Arrived with one broken leg and another leg shorter then the rest. This is the second one I've ordered both broken/defective.
1.0,el producto no es como lo esperaba... muy mala calidad
1.0,This is not what is advertised.  Took forever to receive. Cheaply made. Bought 2x and what came would not have fit a child.
1.0,"Seems a bit small so order up a size, but had to return because the clasp was so hard to open."
1.0,Looks and feels very cheap. Like quarter machine cheap.
1.0,"In no way should these be called seamless!! There is a seam on both sides, and another at a very unfortunate spot on the bottom. Definitely not working for me!!"
1.0,"After a month of use, the tint started peeling terribly. I don’t use these while around water, so they didn’t get wet. Completely useless and will never buy again."
1.0,"Cheep material. I'm a size 12 and I ordered a 1xl, I couldn't button the dang dress😣"
1.0,Even the Small is just way to big!<br />I'm a US dress size 12!
1.0,This is not made well. The band wasn’t even strait
1.0,Like I said in the title... Thin and cheap. Had to return
1.0,"Horrible quality. Looks cheap, feels cheap."
1.0,Will never wear these again! The hoops move around and hurt really bad and made my boobs sore. I'm a 34D and these feel very uncomfortable. I stick to straight barbells now. But it is exactly as described in picture.
1.0,This dress does not look like the picture. It has a zipper which I cannot have.
1.0,Does not stay put ... rolls down the ear and hangs down instead of how the picture shows .
1.0,I don't like it.  Very stiff and bulky and it looks cheap  Wish I could return it.
1.0,The actual image printed on the mask I received was huge. Even pretty lips and noses are very unattractive when they’re twice normal size and cover over half your lower face. Immediately returned this mask.
1.0,"Had the purse for a month and the strapped snapped from the fabric attached to the body so there’s no way to fix it. cheap, disappointed."
1.0,"Looks cheap, nothing like the picture. Returned."
1.0,"The measurements aren’t right, there are weird blue seams on the sides, and there is a half-shirt sheer panel so it looks strange. I had to return."
1.0,This costume was sold as new but had been worn and had a stain down the front of the cape.
1.0,More of an orange color instead of tan.
1.0,I wore these for about three months and love them however they now have bubbles in them all around the edges of the frames. It looks like window tint when it starts to bubble up. And now it’s too late for me to return them
1.0,All I received was the free gift which appeared to be a chain for a very tiny infant. I didn't receive the product paid for which was a Christmas gift. The chain that did come was extremely thin and fragile. I think it would probably have broken if it were attempted to be used. Quality seems poor for what did come. Also they sent silver extenders for a rose gold chain. Waste of time and money.
1.0,"I purchased this bag at a local retailer however I wanted to post a review for anyone who may be considering purchasing a Hobo bag in the Vinatge Collection. This is a very poor quality leather bag. On the first day of using it the interior slip pocket tore at the seam. On the 3rd day of using this bag I noticed that the glazed leather finish had began to rub off on all four corners along the bottom of the bag, I have owned several leather bags and NEVER had the finish rub off within 3 days. I returned the bag. I can only imaging how this bag would look after several months of use, I am sure there would be no finish left at all on it. Very thin cheap leather. Think twice if you are considering any of the bags from this collection."
1.0,"This mask is way over priced. It is very shallow and not much better then a regular mask. Look for a mask that is deeper and sticks out more then this one. those masks allow you to breath easier and you can hear your self sing. I was hoping this mask was the same, but it is not."
1.0,"If you are tall this might not be for you. It claims to be for men and women, my guess is women Cant see these being for males. when I pulled up on them after a couple of hours, they ripped. Waited too long for a refund, my bad. they don't compress as well as others I have purchased. Would not buy again or recommend to others."
1.0,"This ring isn't even plated with sterling silver.  My ring hasn't turned green since I was getting adjustable rings out of the bubblegum machine.  Also, it's rough and snags everything.  Pretty from a distance.  Pretty design.  But very very fake."
1.0,Cheap junk!!
1.0,"It's cute,however,a lower part came off before use. I attached it in superglue."
1.0,"The vest is too small - maybe a 38 at most.  I ordered a large (according to a sticky mailing label it was XL).  The picture of the vest showed two small pockets and a vest pocket.  They are not pockets.  They are scam pockets - they look like pockets, but there are no pockets.  Shabby advertisement!!"
1.0,When washed these crinkle to nothing and you have to iron them to straighten out.
1.0,Really disappointed in this. Usually I’m happy with this brand but this dress is so poorly made and the liner is basically sheer so it’s completely see through.
1.0,Way too tight and way too low. I have other jocks in the same size and they fit much better. Sizing was terrible.
1.0,"super cheap looking, not worth it. going to give them to a 5 year old."
1.0,Too small with no stretch  fits two sizes too small
1.0,"When I got this product I thought it was for a big kid. It turned out it was meant for a toddler, and a very small one.  The product is great, both color and fabric but the specs are misleading.  I gave it to a friend for her newborn."
1.0,This was a gift for our daughter but after seeing the quality we decided not to give it to her. It looks waaay to cheap. Disappointed!!!
1.0,Quality so great and so disappointed about size
1.0,False Advertising!! Not Polarized!
1.0,"It is such a pretty dress. I am soooooo sad that it does not fit me. I was so anxious and looking forward to receiving it, and now I cannot wear it."
1.0,"With all of the positive reviews, I expected better. The fabric is paper thin and cheaply sewed together. The bow came as just a long piece of fabric, not tied or anything! I ordered this as a gift for my friend and there's no way I'm giving this embarrassing piece of fabric to her. Shameful."
1.0,"1 star because I had to to write a review. Now I've bought 2.... Hoping one would pair with my phone, my other phone, or my bfs phone. NOPE!!!! Contacted the seller to talk about it and the said charge it... so I did. Nothing. It will zap ONLY when you force the non button push part down hard as heck. Gave it to someone else and it's now their trash to deal with since it WOULD NOT pair with ANY OF THEIR DEVICES EITHER!!!  It's trash! Save yourself the money and pay a human to do what this was supposed to do. Trash trash trash."
1.0,Wasn't lined like the picture shows.  Really light weight.
1.0,My mom loved it then idk read the tag first I guess may cause cancer🤔
1.0,"Cheap material!! The jacket is smaller than it should be, it looks nothing like the picture! Don't waste your money!!"
1.0,Buttons fell off within a couple weeks. Poor quality.
1.0,The picture of this shirt was nice. However when I received this product it was not at all what I expected.  It looked cheap and as results I will give it away or simply just never wear it.
1.0,I only bought it 3 months ago and the reflective part of the lense is peeling off!  It was good but I thought it would last more then 3 months.  I wouldn’t buy it again.
1.0,Very cheaply made.  The slips for the credit cards/ any card have just cardboard on the inside.  Spend a little more and get a better wallet.  The inside zipper is plastic and broke the first time I used it.
1.0,These pants feel great. But however first time I tried to go on a ride with these the ripped before I could even get out the door. Pretty disappointed cause I really need these at the time of my ride.
1.0,"This is completely useless.  The first time I used it to measure hand strength, it ratcheted up a bit and stuck there permanently.  Whatever I did, the needle stuck on the original number and never moved again. I also happen to know my grip strength is about average, and the needle barely moved before it stuck in place.  Wiggling, tapping, re-doing the grip - nada.  Ironically  I think the one &#34;measurement&#34; I got was inaccurate, and that's where it's stuck forever.  It went in the trash."
1.0,This was so tiny I don’t think it would fit a newborn’s septum (not that I’d try).
1.0,They do not last long before the print peels off.
1.0,Kind of a waste. After putting it on once it will never be worn.
1.0,Product is described as 4 M US Toddler. It's not it a 4 in Children's.
1.0,"Hello, Amazon, photos of a fishing pole don’t match the product."
1.0,Not cotton material or anything closed to an African print
1.0,It was perfect fit. I am 135 5’1 with post partum baby belly and these are so comfortable and amazing but didn’t even make it past 2 days of wearing with small holes and fuzzing appearing everywhere.
1.0,Multiple pairs broke before even wearing them. I shipped some in protective packaging and some of them broke too.
1.0,It looks so cheap!
1.0,I like the style but it runs at least like me size to small.
1.0,Ugly look like a moron bulky on face
1.0,Terrible quality very flimsy and cheap feeling
1.0,Style with 2 pockets is not nice
1.0,Did not like the  material
1.0,"Very ugly, sleeves are way too long and this is a poorly crafted ANYTHING because I am honestly not sure what the heck arrived in my mailbox"
1.0,"Not the colors pictured. Ordered white shirt with teal/purple shells, received white shirt with black/plum shells"
1.0,Can't really wear it if it stabs you in the neck whenever you look down.
1.0,Ordered a pair of pineapple earrings but was sent a black beaded bracelet instead.
1.0,They work however after I washed them the have shrunk and fit way to tight making the usless for adults.
1.0,"I wear a 7 1/2 hat size. This beanie is made for a young or small head, definitely not a one size fits all. I needed to stretch it out to be somewhat wearable. Buyers use caution. The material is not soft as well. The design and color options are very cool."
1.0,"Had high hopes for this backpack when ordered. The quality appeared to be better than expected but after less than a month the zipper on the main compartment broke making the bag useless. Missed returning the item for a refund by a few days. Before ordering this item I noted the bad reviews regarding the broken zippers but thought I'd take the chance for a winner. The item received was a loser. If I could do it again, I'd save my money and put it towards better quality confirmed by positive reviews."
1.0,"Absolute junk ! do not buy, it stopped ticking after couple of hours."
1.0,Very little too bad
1.0,The fabric is cheap and colors fade after first wash. The stitches show on the sides. Would not rebuy.
1.0,"Si los compras para disminuir el frío en tus manos está bien! Si es para hacer deportes y manipular tú celular NO LOS COMPRES! Realmente son BASURA como todo lo hecho en China! La verdad no me fijé que eran fabricados en China, sino no los compró"
1.0,"I liked it a lot for the 2 days I had it before the skull and crossbones fell off. I could put it back in, but it just fell out again a couple hours later. don't buy if you plan on using it"
1.0,"Very poor quality - cheaply made! Bottom line - you get what you pay for! Should have expected this, my fault for ordering in the first place."
1.0,This product is beyond subpar. Do Not buy!!!
1.0,"My headline pretty much says it all.  I ignored the negative reviews and to my chagrin, they were spot on.  This holder does not hold sunglasses.  It looks nice though."
1.0,Small. I have an average size head and they are too small. Quality wasn’t very good.
1.0,Horribly made. Would never wear
1.0,The material is horrible it was for a christmas party and I could not wear it. Had to get another dress.<br />Sizing is to small.
1.0,They made the print SO big that you can't read it at all. American idea made by an Anti American manufacturer? Maybe. But would never again buy this
1.0,The firefighter charm is very small..<br />Cant see the lettering or the symbol.
1.0,Oh man those other reviews weren’t lying about how small these are. I’m 5’0” and 115 lbs so I went with the small. I couldn’t even attempt to suck it in to make these fit. The size chart is fabulously inaccurate. My hips are 36” the size small pants I received were at best 32”. Damn. The fabric was nice but not stretchy. I might try a large.
1.0,Yes 2 dollars get what you pay for. broke 2 days after getting it. chains uneven. stones missing .bad bad
1.0,Don't bother! I bought these for a party and these started going out before we even got there. They were dead by the end of the night. What a waste of money.
1.0,I ordered 2 in different colors and both were way too tight. I ordered the same type of tunics from other companies in the same order and they fit perfectly. Sad because I like the colors and pattern. I returned them.
1.0,It’s a pale yellow kinda but the material is really nice. So they are just house cleaning shorts. Not to be worn out.
1.0,I bought the coat to take to Madrid on vacation. Before I got on the plane the coat started “shedding” onto my clothes and backpack. I regret this purchase.
1.0,Does not stick! Do not buy
1.0,"nothing like the photos, poor material. Dont waste your money, I couldnt even wear it once."
1.0,Too large for my wrist unable to wear
1.0,Washes terrible… ended up balling up by 3 wash!
1.0,Not a good product material snags on anything and the zipper is so flimsy it will break pronto. The lights and bright but can easily break. Not worth the price... way too expensive for what it is =( Return
1.0,"It looks navy in pictures but its barney purple. Pants 2 sizes to big, sweat shirt to small. The purples are not the same colors. Fabric is very stiff and cheap feeling. I sent it back !"
1.0,On the first wear these leggings got holes whilst putting on...the fabric was dry rotted..<br />Disappointed
1.0,I looked nicer  on the website...the cut is small
1.0,"They came broken, the nose piece was laying in the bag."
1.0,Hardly a ‘puffer’. Came vacuum sealed and super wrinkly.. gave it home to ‘fluff up’ but never did. Returned item
1.0,It came ripped in the front. I didn’t want to hassle so I just gave it away.
1.0,"This dress is not as pictured. It is a big, frumpy, shapeless dress! The sleeves are wide and floppy! The color is not navy as pictured but blue."
1.0,I bought this because everyone gave it great reviews. Just wanted something waterproof that will last me a while. I’ve only had this for three weeks now and it got a huge cut in it. First time I went to wash my hands it stopped working :( don’t think I’ll recommend it to anyone because it breaks very easily
1.0,Horrible washed it on delicate cycle and it came apart very poorly made
1.0,Buckel keeps falling off. Save your time and money.
1.0,Very cheap sending it back
1.0,This product is winter sleep ware not for ever day wear. Polyester is what I requested
1.0,This dress is of poor quality! Extremely thin & see through! I would not recommend anyone to purchase this item especially from the seller. I tried to return the item and was unable too. She did not want to refund my money. So I took it as a lost and would never ever order from this seller again.
1.0,Cloth covers entire face. It’s ridiculously large
1.0,Jacket was too small and is being returned
1.0,"I think I bought the watch that another reviewer returned, the one where the hands don't line up right. Is it 8:00? Is it 9:00? Who can say? I think it was low to sell this again even as a $2 Warehouse deal. Because I don't mind an occasional challenge I took it apart to see if I could fix it. Nah. I'm keeping it only for the band (which is cheap and already is peeling in a tiny spot) since I seem to have more watch faces than bands to go with them."
1.0,"The backing didn't lock properly within 24 hours 1 earring was missing, not good for a toddler"
1.0,"Poor design: The fit is fine when standing, but when sitting, crotch will goose you constantly, and anything in  your pocket will eventually dump out. Plus, there is no fly."
1.0,Already sent one back due to the zipper breaking after only wearing once. I recieved a replacement and the zipper on the right pocket is broken upon arrival. Frustrating!!!
1.0,I purchased this item because my dog loves chewing on water bottles and I've even had to take cans from her. My dog didn't like the chew toy; the rubber really smelled. It sat out about a month before my dog showed any interest. It didn't even last an hour! She's less than 50 pounds.
1.0,This dress fit ok but the fabric was horrible and cheap. It felt like tent material. Couldn’t return it fast enough
1.0,Ordered a size 7...received a 14/16. Guess it's a pajama shirt instead.
1.0,I was extremely disappointed with the size of this pendant. It should be advertised in Children's Jewelry - too small for a woman's neck.
1.0,"Size chart is not accurate for this top, it's not fitted right."
1.0,"Rips easily, not from wearing but just the zippers don't move well and the pant will tear."
1.0,I brought these to wear at the office with my key fob but they are so small they cut into my wrist . The ones I had previously I was able to push them up above my elbow a<br />So they and the fob were out of the way but not these.  A waste of money!<br />P
1.0,Sizing is completely off. The shirt does not look like the picture at all. The quality is cheap. It was cheaper for me to just throw it away than return it.
1.0,Arrived broken. One earring would not close. Very dissapointing. Returned.
1.0,This was bought in an xl but fits like a 5x. Also for some reason there was no elastic in the waist. As if they forgot to put it in.
1.0,Rusted quickly
1.0,"Ordered these a long time ago as single shirts, got XL and they were active basic.<br />Reordered next bigger size now, getting a 3 pack, and it was a completely different brand and WAY too big.<br />I believe the 3 pack and the single shirts are the difference in sizing and brand."
1.0,I hated this dress. Not at all what I expected from the picture above. The sleeves were a lot shorter came up to my elbows.  In photo they go pass the woman's elbows closer to her wrist. The lone sits right under my breast so it looks very taky. Again in the photo the line goes across the woman's waist line. I bought this dress as a part of a costume for the Virgin Mary for holy week but it's an embarrassment to wear this posing as her. Do not buy it a waste of money it's very thin can see everything right threw The dress. Horrible! !!! Very disappointed.
1.0,"It’s a really cheap heat print, not sewn or anything like that. It’s only redeeming quality is the cheap price."
1.0,Was not what was hyped to be.  Not very precise vision.
1.0,"This is just a piece of cloth, and I felt smothered when I put it on. It is unwearable."
1.0,Item has no stretch
1.0,I have a big booty an small waste a size small fits me like a M doesn't hug my tummy
1.0,Bathing suit is cute but they sent me a strap that was coming apart
1.0,[[VIDEOID:21a28b45d6c6903f0ba7c80ab07a482b]] It is supposed to be 100 random but it’s basically all doubles!!! Will not purchase again
1.0,"Hats were too small for my wife.  Tried to return the hats and was met with a request to send a picture of the hats first.  Their response was that ""it does not look like the hats are too small and it is a very stretchy material and they should be fine.  We can't take the hats back"".  Now stuck with two hats that will never get worn.  Not a very good return policy."
1.0,"Leg opening very tight. Not good for much of anything. Waist size is good. These were for my son and his leg size is not huge. Adidas shorts fit him perfectly  but he picked these for working out and for price. Go with another brand, these arrived months later than when expected as well."
1.0,"This dress is very short, can't bend in it.  The Olive colour is beautiful though"
1.0,"This didn’t lift at all. And the other reviewer was right, I have a 36 D and my boobs felt like they were split. And coming off was too painful. I’d recommend only for people with smaller breasts."
1.0,Total disappointment!..very POOR quality..ARRIVED BROKEN EVEN THOUGH HEAVILY WRAPPED IN BUBBLE PACKAGING. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!
1.0,"I bought two of these, the latches didn’t work on either, the finish rubbed off with my fingers just taking it out of the package. I wasn’t even able to try wearing either because of how badly they were made."
1.0,Right out of the box one shoe doesnt turn on at all..  Even after charging overnight nothing at all!!  Customer service!!!  Yea they dont exist at all they dont respond back to issues or complaints at all...  Complete waste of money
1.0,The picture looks way bigger on Amazon. You can barely tell what it is in person.
1.0,Very poor quality. Print does not look like picture. Runs small. Would not order again. Not worth the money. Thinking about returning but hate to do returns. Even color is poor. Looks faded. Very disappointed since pictures look so cute.
1.0,Thin material. Does not flow well on the body. Very shapeless.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6b24899e55f4198fcc472ba8c3e64847]] I wore this super cute dress 2xs. I give it a five for cuteness and how it fits me.  Zero stars for the way it washed and material held up. First wash in cold (did not dry) and it came out with all this material fluffs.  Why is the cotton doing this?  I’m am totally sad.  It is not wearable and I’m out of return date.
1.0,Loved the look and feel of these.  But I only got about 2 weeks wear out of these before they broke.  The band broke off at the hinge that attaches to the watch face.
1.0,No me agrado está muy tosco
1.0,"I had to pay for shipping, so I bought two shirts. I ordered a size up from usual (following Amazon recommendations). This was a mistake and I feel mislead. The shirts appear to be an athletic fit online… not so in real life. They are way too big. If you’re looking for a fitted shirt, this is not the one for you."
1.0,My son had a special event and he really wanted to be Deadpool. He wore this for maybe 3 hours and it began to rip at the seams where the zipper is. Very poorly made so disappointed.
1.0,Really nice looking but it stopped working after 2 months and it’s outside of the return window<br /><br />The manufacturer stated they don’t even sell this product on Amazon so they are also of no help
1.0,"ORDERED BLACK & GREY, WHEN IT ARRIVED IT LOOKED LIKE DARK BROWN, AS SOON AS YOU BEND IT (IE: TO MOUNT & WEAR IT) IT TURNED TO FUDGE BROWN IN COLOR. STITCHING IS MORE TAN THAN GREY.  OTHER FEEDBACKS STATE THE SAME. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
1.0,"I was looking forward to giving this to my daughter on her birthday but when we received it, the colors didn’t at all look like they did online. The top leotard does not match the skirt at all. They were totally different shades of pink. It did not look good so I am returning it."
1.0,Talla m pero se sube hasta los senos no se queda bajada la blusa se dobla al ser muy fina
1.0,"I didn't try this on so I actually can't say anything about the fit, it seems to be the right length for a size 38. These slippers are entirely made of plastic, there is no bamboo or straw component. This is plastic made to look like bamboo. I was very disappointed since I was looking for a bamboo summer slipper specifically because my feet don't tolerate plastic shoes (rash.)"
1.0,Purchased these bands for the color but quality is not the same as the original Ace 2 bands.  The bands quickly got dirty and washing it does not remove the stains.  If you buy go with the darker bands.
1.0,These are totally crappy and very poorly made. They're cheap because they're cheap. Simple as that. Total garbage.
1.0,They did not stay on. Within 1-2 steps they were already slipping off my foot. They’re unwearable.
1.0,Cheap material. It came in very short and mostly the whole dress was thin and very see through. I was disappointed as the picture of it looks beautiful
1.0,"Kevin McCallister would’ve passed out and been taken out by the Wet Bandits in the first 10 minutes of the movie if his hat was this tight. The quality is also not in line with the price point, which is saying something, as this is an inexpensive hat. Not even worth it for a one-time use costume."
1.0,the pins fell out within the first week.  I tried fixing it and then a few days later it broke apart again.  very dissapointed.
1.0,Wish I could leave this thing a zero star it is horrible and quality the coding doesn’t even go around each piece of titanium or supposed titanium and it looks like it comes in a chocolate candy box wouldn’t pay five dollars for this watchband sent back immediately
1.0,"Please don’t order this shirt! It’s very cute, but it’s gigantic on me. I even tried tucking it in, and I looked ridiculous. I’m 5’3 and weigh 125 got a size small."
1.0,"Ring came with deformed, unreadable lettering. Don't buy."
1.0,Not as pictured. It is a bit beat up. I cannot use it as a gift.
1.0,Not good.... two in a row now that looked like it needed a simple battery replacement... Not the issue very disappointed.  I own several and have never had issues like I had with the Ultaride...Back to The Supertide I go!!
1.0,"The pin broke on one of the bands after the first time I went to change it out.  I got it put on there just fine.  Kept it on about a week, went to change bands this morning and the pin popped off now I can't get the band off my fitbit. I'm prolly gonna have to break the band in order to get it off."
1.0,"I normally wear a sm/md. I bought a large and it got like a CD. The material is horrible and is super short. I'm 5 feet and this dress comes to my upper thighs. My husband asked ""what is that"""
1.0,"This shirt is like a thin, scratchy almost sweater material. It is see through and somewhat stiff. It does not lay nicely and just feels frumpy overall. I'd like to return it, but have to pay return shipping. Not sure it is worth the trouble."
1.0,"This mask sucks. It does not fit me at all, it looks bad on me, and it is not the right color."
1.0,The entire crotch section ripped in half within minutes of wearing
1.0,"What a joke, I got white cropped top with tinsel which looks nothing like a photo, tinsels are very short the top is barely covering my breasts and I'm a skinny person. It's very short, cheapest quality. Not worth $1"
1.0,Necesito devolverlo
1.0,The shorts material is very thin. Dislike it completely. Want to return. Very poor quality product!!
1.0,"Fit is fine but material is very thin, clingy, wrinkles easy, and unattractive."
1.0,The material is stiff and though it has stretch does not seem to look the same after it has been stretched. They run small. Have not washed yet but I don’t anticipate that going well.
1.0,I ordered white. The white has a purple tinge to it. Big disappointment. Returning.
1.0,"The worst, never stayed together"
1.0,Based on reviews I ordered a small. I’m 5’6” and 134lbs I usually wear a size 28 in jeans and the small was so small. It’s completely fitted on my legs/butt and I can’t evem sit in them. Had I ordered a medium maybe things would be different
1.0,TOO THIN. ITS NOT SUITABLE TO WEAR OUTSIDE AT ALL....
1.0,"Items returned after 5 minutes of use. We have the Healeys for my older daughter and they are great. These ones are hard to balance and super dangerous, my daughter was so excited to get them but was too afraid to stand on them. The fact that the wheels are so close to each other made her trip in the house several times that she refused to have them or try to use them. Returned - the wheels are so close to each and shoes are dangerous for a child."
1.0,"I want to start by saying this bracelet is beautiful. It is thin and dainty, unlike the chunky comparable one that Pandora offers. The snap looks like another charm that adds to the beauty of this bracelet. The charm stoppers Pandora offers slide around like another charm on this bracelet, but that doesn't bother me. My problem with this bracelet is the size inaccuracy. The perfect bracelet size for my wrist is 7.0 -7.25 inches. I ordered the 7 inch and could barely close the bracelet. I measured the bracelet and found that it was less than 6.75 inches! I figured they must run small and returned it and ordered the next size, which is 7.5 inches. However, I just received the 7.5 inch bracelet and it falls off my wrist. I measured it and it is over 7.75 inches! What on earth?! There was an entire inch difference between bracelets that are marked to only be half an inch different! I am saddened that I won't be able to wear either of these bracelets. I would suggest you only get this bracelet if you have either very small or very large wrists. I really hope Nina Queen starts to produce bracelets that are true to size."
1.0,"Shipping was ok, product was crap, pearls where and are very faded really crappy dye job that's for sure will not order from them again!"
1.0,"I bought this necklace and initially loved it, but it has, after about a month or two, started turning a brownish color that is ugly.  I'll never wear the necklace again.  I'm very sad.  What would make it change color like that??"
1.0,"These were extremely painful, so I sent them back!"
1.0,Got these and they did not fit my gf at all no stretch to short
1.0,"Wow, this sweater is so thin and short that I'm not sure how it can be called a cardigan.  It had different colored pieces of thread all over it and a big pull place in the front.  Do Not recommend!!!!!"
1.0,When this product arrived we removed it from its package only to find the zipper on the top part of the costume was broken.
1.0,"Ordered a M Adult in neon green….it’s maybe a M in kids sizing. Ridiculous. I’m a size 6-8 athletic woman and couldn’t even get one arm through the itty bitty tiny top, not to mention the scrap of fabric labeled bottoms. Seriously, Childrens sizing."
1.0,Do not hold up. Let the girls go and the bra just roll down.🙄
1.0,After only 2 weeks the gold finish started to fade. I will definetely return and request a refund
1.0,Looks Like its for your wrist but its a belt for your waist
1.0,The product arrive but did not come complet miss you 1 money packets .1 ID  Windows  i paid for
1.0,the pins keep coming out of the face holder. super cheap. total waste of money.
1.0,Purse looked nice but when i unboxed it one of the front zippers was damaged and had to return it. It had plenty of room in it. Good storage.
1.0,"I was so happy when it arrived, it is much prettier than in the pictures. Imagine my dismay when it fell off the second time I ever wore it. The metal bit that clamped onto the string bent loose and it isn't anything I can fix. So disappointed. Would not recommend."
1.0,Look pretty to bad the hooks were stuck together  didn't get  to wear them
1.0,I was lead to believe I ordered all 4 of the year for the price but we only received the dino version one. My daughter is happy with anything so it wasn't a biggie. The material is elastic it's pretty tight on my 9 y.o. head to put thru so she barely wears it
1.0,These are as difficult to open as the key rings.
1.0,Horrible. XL maybe for a child.
1.0,Zipper broke ( tore out ) just after about two weeks
1.0,I was looking forward to wearing the printed tights because I wasn’t able to find them anywhere close. I saw a reality TV star with them on and was even more excited to wear them. When they arrived and we’re too small I was highly disappointed.
1.0,THESE ARE NOT PRE SHRUNK.. DO NO BUY ALSO VERY THIN..
1.0,What I recieved does not look like this picture<br />I ordered a large. This does not lay properly not a flow on the body it's a more clinging type of material. Does not have care instruction label attached to item. Material is more of a ribbed streache type of material instead of a nice flowing. Would not recommend very disappointed
1.0,"Not true to size at all, very small, belie this is chinese sizing (maybe even smaller) chinese sizing is 2 sizes smaller then US sizing for example a large in china is a small in the US"
1.0,This dress is cut very small. I ordered a medium but it’s more like an extra small. I will have to return it. It’s really cute but way too small.
1.0,"Buy this if you want a dress. It might possible be cute with leggings, but NOT cute on a Plus Sized person."
1.0,The fabric is so thin and doesn’t support the feet.
1.0,The band attachment has the Garmin quick attachment with a regular pin attachment. The pin has come lose or out twice in 2 days almost causing me to lose my $700 Fenix 5x. DO NOT BUT IT!
1.0,Shorter in the front then I expected. Runs really small
1.0,"I wore these sandals to a wedding and barely lasted an hour.  While they fit well and looked nice, they felt like they had absolutely no padding at the ball of the foot and were very uncomfortable. Have not worn since."
1.0,"The necklace came and it was already broken, the sphere not attached to the outer circle. I managed to get the pegs in but it came apart again so I have returned it. Also, it was very hard to read the time under the bubble face."
1.0,Don't ever buy these shorts they're more like scrubs so unflattering I'm returning them I actually hate them
1.0,"I didn't like it, those beads is too big. I can't returned, cost me more then what I pay for this bracelet."
1.0,Only received 1 of the pajamas. I ordered a 2 pack. The pack was opened and one of the pajamas was missing. Returning it now.
1.0,TOTAL CRAP PRODUCT
1.0,I GAVE IT TO MY SISTER WAS SOO JEALOUS. THE TOP IS SMALLER THAN THE REST OF THE SHIRT. AROUND THE ARMS SO IT DOESN'T HANG RIGHT AT THE TOP AS SHOWN ON MODEL
1.0,Only 1 boot lights up. Very disappointed and returning.
1.0,description instructs to order 2 sizes larger. It was huge. Should have ordered normal size
1.0,It didn't look like it should when I tried it on. You can see the padding & the wire.
1.0,Dont buy this im begging you it looks nothing like the picture
1.0,"can not use, doesn t fit"
1.0,Latch broke within a week
1.0,"So I bought two of these, and while I think it is beautiful and so cute... the chain turned colors after a few times wearing it. I will be getting a real silver chain for the paper airplane and I hope it doesnt turn. So far the plane has not."
1.0,"I ordered these for my daughter for Christmas and she loved them. Unfortunately, one of them already broke."
1.0,"Not all of the colors are ""convertible long sleeve."" If you check the photos, there are two different shirts.  The Army Green color shirt has short sleeves and different pockets from the long sleeve shirts shown in the photos.  If you want a long sleeve shirt don't order Army Green. Also, the extra small is quite baggy, the size runs pretty large."
1.0,"Purchased 4 months in advance for a wedding, thinking I'd have plenty of time to get it in.. no. Came 2 weeks before the wedding. Fabric is horrible! Production was absolute crap! Hema didn't line up, uneven seams, zipper not functional. Definitely would not recommend.  Requested a refund and sent dress back same week it was delivered... That was in October...still no refund..."
1.0,"Instead of being muted colors, they're very bright and corny looking. Not even worth returning. Just went right into the trash."
1.0,I am 5'5 and weigh 149. bust 36DD. I purchased a 38 and returned because it was way too long.  I got the 36 an still way too long. I cant go any smaller as it wont fit the bust.  Quality is good but again item is way way to long
1.0,"These were advertised as new, with leather uppers. They are obviously well worn as seen with the plush lining being matted and worn. The outsides were muddy and dirty. The soles were imbedded with sand. The uppers are synthetic. I don't know what kind of quality control they have, but it's obviously lacking."
1.0,Fit terribly like 2 sizes too small! Very disappointing
1.0,"I bought the necklace without reading the reviews,  my mistake.  The necklace is cheap & lightweight. I will be returning this item. I fell that the seller should be a little pacific about the quality of this item. This Is A waist of people's time."
1.0,These ARE so cheap!  The post that comes up the ear is scratchy and the crystals are blue not a clear or white like advertised.  Definitely returning them.
1.0,Did great for about 1 month then I didn't wear it for a long time and I put it on just the other day and it fell apart on my wrist
1.0,No where near the size that it states.  Cannot give zero stars.
1.0,It is nothing like it looks in the picture
1.0,"So disappointed with this outfit. So cheap, feels like a piece of paper. Saw good reviews so i thought i'd give it a try.<br />Bought the green but it looks yellow."
1.0,"I didn't even get the right dress.. It's not a maxi dress. It barely reaches my knees. I ordered a small, the tag says XL. I'm so confused.."
1.0,"These masks looked cute but they were way too big for my 5 year old. They fit me though, so definitely not a child's size. And the reindeer mask was sewn together wrong with the nose piece on the chin! I had to cut and sew it so my son could wear."
1.0,This is one of the cheapest shirts I’ve seen. It’s horrible! Definitely returning it. Of course it’s made and shipped from China. I wish they would bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S.
1.0,Quality was not there. Plastic clasp on back did not stay closed. Cute but not worth the money. I returned.
1.0,Running  very big
1.0,The left hand glove sticking was very poor & was missing.
1.0,"Looks very nice and appears to be well made, no machining burs or unfinished surfaces. Feels nice and smooth and looks great on the watch and wrist. The finish matches the matte sides of the watch case perfectly, even the polished surfaces of the watch case looks good with the bracelet. Once I figured how to attach bracelet, it literally took less than 1 minute to fully attach to my 45mm Galaxy Watch 3.<br /><br />The only issue I have is the fit of the links against the watch case. One side fits great and is symmetrical against the watch case. The other side of the bracelet attaches lower on one end which creates a slope. When you look down at the watch, that slope creates a noticeable gap between the case and the bracelet. I look to see if there was some sort of adjustment I could make, I did not see any.<br /><br />This is a nice band, a little heavier than the VMORO brand but I don't mind the extra weight. Unfortunately It does not fit on the 45mm Galaxy Watch 3 case as advertised. There is a noticeable an uneven gap between the watch case and the metal band. Therefore I will be returning this item and rating it low because it does not fit as advertised."
1.0,Looked nothing like the photo really. Very rough and large. Not very colorful. Bummer.
1.0,Just received today. It has a paper label on it. Will peel off in no time. I could have done this myself and saved my Money! This company is a joke!
1.0,Very bad and I returned
1.0,They’re cheap and the ears aren’t centered.
1.0,Ordered these once and was really happy with the nice narrow triglides as pictured. I reordered thinking I had found a good source of perfect tidglides only to receive a different design that is bulkier...
1.0,I got a medium and they were so small I couldn’t even get them up over my knees.
1.0,The sizes are deceiving. What I received was not a plus size womens dress. I received a child dress. Totally not satiafied. Will never order from this company again.
1.0,"This watch looks nice, exactly as I expected based on the picture. However, I've had it for a couple weeks, I've already noticed a couple aspects where the quality is subpar. The latch sometimes comes undone. In addition, some moisture has gotten trapped under the glass of the watchface. It fogs up the glass, which looks annoying and makes it harder to read the time. I haven't tried burying it in rice yet, but I'm hoping that will remove the moisture from under the glass. UPDATE: It stopped working a couple weeks after I got it. I returned it and they sent me a new one. The new one worked and then 11 days later stopped. I am very disappointed! This watch looks nice but is clearly not functional."
1.0,The 2xl fits like a medium. Very thin material
1.0,I didn't received like in the picture
1.0,"The material of these leggings are dense, scuba suit like but with a rough texture. You can hear the fibers rub shiner each other similar to a wind breaker suit material. They are absolutely suffocating to wear. I am returning them. I would never give them as a gift. I do not recommend."
1.0,"The quality of the material is not good,"
1.0,Es muy mal material
1.0,"This is an awful purchase. Seriously, click away. I've bought a million things here. I have no idea how I got fooled. shame on me."
1.0,"Everyone is right... this runs way too small. I typically wear a medium, sometimes large, and the XL didn't even fit over my hips. Good thing it is cheap."
1.0,I ordered the red top in a small and it is nothing like the picture its way cheaper and worse looking plus it was too small to even be a small.
1.0,"Broke, notified seller and got no response."
1.0,"I purchased and as soon as I opened it, pulled it out and just put it back in the bag it came in. I was so disappointed! It took 2 almost 3 months to come. It was poor quality of material and see through. In the photo it looks like a thick cotton popcorn like sweater. In real it’s just a terrible digital pixelated print. Not to mention when I returned it I didn’t get a full refund. It’s not worth your time or money!"
1.0,This product is cheap. The clasp broke taking it out of the paper holder. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"I was mistaken, it is for a human..."
1.0,Did not fit well. Returned.
1.0,Did not like ..
1.0,"One size definitely does not fit all! I'm a size 34A and this bra was a poor poor fit. #1. Cup inserts are gigantic and bunched...ok, no big deal, I just took them out since I don't have a problem with the occasional nippage. Welllll....#2. The bra sat even lower on my chest, and there's no way to fix this, since none of the straps are adjustable, of course, due to the design. Also...#3 Just too loose of a fit in general. The straps did not lay flat on my chest, in that flattering way you see on the model. All in all, disappointment."
1.0,Bought because i thought was cute and sporty and liked the military time and seconds on it because i am a nurse but the watch will not set to the correct date or time. I followed directions step by step and will not work and am not able to use.
1.0,"Yeah no. They're not clipons, they're for pierced ears. It sucked to find that out after waiting so long for them to come in."
1.0,"This is a item my daughter had gotten and was really excited for. When she got it, as soon as she went to put it on it broke."
1.0,"This shirt is made out of that gross printable fabric, very poor quality. Save yourself the hassle, its really poor quality."
1.0,Attractive but runs small - - t-shirt weight material
1.0,Fabric is too thin and see through. The straps were stretched out. Too many loose threads.Terrible fit.
1.0,Returned to wide
1.0,Nothing... I'm waiting on a refund... please and thanks.. I'm really disappointed because North Face are really good boots...
1.0,"The pattern and cut was horrible. The bottom provides no coverage, it might as well be a thing, and the length was for someone with a long torso, I think, but even then it was too narrow at the top that it is either made for someone with no breasts or meant to just provide coverage for the cleavage! I honestly can't tell. The material was ok for comfort. The item was both too large and too small at the same time for my body type, 5'5"", large bust, and post partum.  I'm returning it."
1.0,Sooo Small and was broken
1.0,The paws were not included
1.0,"Garbage, false advertising. Couldn't even give them away. Tossed in trash. Looks nothing like the panties in photo, what a rip off. How do these companies get away with this. It must be a trend almost everything I order now is Asian size. Not only were they too small but they are ugly and cheap. I would give no stars but its not a option"
1.0,"These are the most badly made pants I've ever seen. Threads hang off the unfinished seams. The pockets bunch up and look terrible when you put the pants on. The price on these seemed really good, but they turn out to be not worth even that low price! Do not waste your time and money!"
1.0,Way to small. I always wear a large and I couldn't even get the product past my hips.
1.0,"These are the worst things I have ever purchased off of Amazon. They look like someone got cheap fabric,cut square holes in it, sewed it together and called them pants. I bought a size up and couldn’t get them up my thighs. Felt very cheap and plastic"
1.0,This hat has a giant front panel that will make anyone look ridiculous.
1.0,These qlasses were junk. I through them away. They didn’t deserve even one star.
1.0,"The steel looks too old and not shiney, and for sure there's no way to make it more shiny, looks like rusted."
1.0,Not compression tank
1.0,"Half of the flag came off in the way, you just wave the hat and the stars go flying … very cheap quality…"
1.0,Post bent immediately when I removed the back of the earring to put it on. Super soft metal. Bunny. Got a refund.
1.0,This came in a beat up box with none of the stakes or wires to help it stand which were to be included. Very disappointing.
1.0,They will not fit Maui Jim sunglasses.
1.0,I ordered a large but it looked like a 5 year old could fit in it.
1.0,The picture has been updated since I bought them. Originally did not appear as the photo so I was disappointed
1.0,This product is not fur women that wear a 20 with a little stomach it's too small it's for slim people it doesn't even look like in the picture it's why didn't the picture what is playing when you get it maybe somebody that wear 18 it has a little stomach and wear it
1.0,I ordered a 3x and it is nowhere near that. Its more like a large. I'm not sure who decides the sizes but they need to go back to the drawing board. This is not a plus size item at all. More like a size 9/10 seriously....
1.0,"The jacket is very cute, but the first time I wore it a button fell off.  There isn't a way to fix it since they are metal.  Also, when I wear the jacket all of the buttons make a jingle sound because they are so loose. Only a matter of time before the other buttons fall off."
1.0,Wow. Such a cheap set.. not worth any of what I paid for it
1.0,"I normally wear a medium (5'04, 165) and these were like an XXS"
1.0,Looked cheap and dull
1.0,"Cheap material, didn't fit good"
1.0,Not really like it. and it’s made from china not good
1.0,THESE ARE NOT THE GLOVES ADVERTISED IN THEIR PICTURES
1.0,It came broke.
1.0,"Fit great , comfortable to wear but  ..smell like chemical dye badly even after I washed them 2x and the dye color faded to a blackish gray color after two washes in cold water"
1.0,Too big for my dress shirt if they make it smaller that's be more elegant and fancier
1.0,So I am really not sure if this dress just really really runs small or if I received the wrong size dress.  There is no label on the dress no tag or anything.  When I took it out of the bag I was shocked.  I thought I would just give it to my daughter as it was cheap enough.  My daughter is very tall and skinny she wears a 3-4 and was to little for her.  So disappointed as it was really a cute dress.  I usually wear a large but ordered up to an extra large and sill was about 3 sizes to small
1.0,Too torn to actually wear anywhere. Material is way too thin.
1.0,Don’t waste your money on this.
1.0,I did not like the material of this dress. I thought this was a nice linen or maybe cotton dress. It look more like a shower curtain. I was not happy at all.
1.0,This thing already stopped working. Took it to a watch shop and the gears are faulty. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"the metal is so soft, that I have to readjust the ring and at times it catches on things and bends out far enough to lose it"
1.0,Band didn't fit on my Gear S2 watch. Had to replace the locks with the original ones because it doesn't lock at all. Once i replaced them it worked
1.0,TOO RUFF! I threw them away.
1.0,Took over a month to get here and fits HORRIBLY!!!!
1.0,"Worst water shoes ever! My son wore it literally 4 times until the completely tore, ripped and were unwearable during our trip. Skip!!!"
1.0,"It's a bad product, not the correct zise. Do not buy it. Also the construction material is bad. The sewing thread is a poor quality. When wearing the sewing thread is separated."
1.0,"Waste of money, doesnt fit. Pointless to return, gotta find a drop off location for ups, wasting gas."
1.0,Came in a 4x bag that was opened even though I ordered a 2x. The treading was coming out of as well
1.0,"My first impression upon opening the package was that this shirt felt exactly like my children's polyester pajamas, which are prone to pilling and static. I would not at all describe it as soft or flowy. As I unfolded the shirt, I realized it looked like it had been worn! It had hair stuck to it, in addition to pilling. Absolutely disgusting. Returned immediately, along with another pattern I purchased that, while it actually looked new, was the same clingy fabric. I would not recommend!"
1.0,they are not good for night driving
1.0,"Very disapointed!!!! The oyster was already open and the was &#34;pearl&#34; rolling around in the can. I could tell this was not a real pearl, as it has a seam line all the way around. I would suggest every one go to pearl-factory.com. I have done business with them and their pearls are beautiful!!"
1.0,Plastic piece on strap was broken when I received product. Plus pink in pattern on bottoms was a different shade of pink than top. Otherwise very cute suit. Sad and disappointed…
1.0,"I wish I could get my money back. This thing is so tiny you can barely make out what it is. Very, very disappointed. Shame on you for your false advertising, I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money."
1.0,Cross keeps turning the opposite direction
1.0,This shoe was extremely uncomfortable for me. The straps were cutting into my feet with 20 mins of having them on
1.0,Returning<br />Too small no tags on it either!
1.0,Tela de muy mala calidad da picazón
1.0,"First it didn’t fit at all the bottoms were too big and looked like a diaper and the top was more like an x-large than a small. It felt cheaply made and the back wouldn’t even clasp. I had to return it, wouldn’t recommend wasting your money."
1.0,do not buy if your are riding in rain this is not Waterproof water goes right through it not sure how it got all the good reviews as a waterproof jacket.
1.0,Size chart is inaccurate. Much smaller than shown
1.0,Was super small didn't fit as a 3x
1.0,It’s super little 🙁
1.0,BABY HAND BAG..<br /> SENT BACK.
1.0,Ordered two of the pictured product and two different bags came.
1.0,Don’t waste your money looks nothing like the picture very cheap and not at all what is described
1.0,Only good thing I can say about this dress was it is comfortable. But it was nothing like the picture as advertised. I bought this dress (the tye dye one) because I love bright colors. I opened my dress and immediately was sad seeing these dull boring colors. Not to mention it was just not very flattering at all. I was so excited to get this dress heck I even had to make a thirty minute trip to pick it up because ups screwed up I was all excited to open the package just to get a marjor let down.
1.0,I would NOT recommend this shirt.
1.0,"Ordered this because the picture showed the item was all purple, but it’s not the trim is white mislead"
1.0,"Way bigger than I thought, but pretty"
1.0,Quality is poor~
1.0,"Ordered a medium but it was too big, ordered a small compared it to the medium IT WAS THE EXACT SAME. I will be contacting the maker for sure. I'm 5'2 125lbs. I feel like a real small should fit me perfectly, the medium was just too long for my body type, the hem hit me mid thigh. The picture that is shown makes the sweater look the perfect length but it is much longer. Such a cute designs but it goes well past my booty."
1.0,I wanted so badly for this to fit! It looked so cute in the picture. Unfortunately I have a rather large chest and it just wasn’t happening. I needed to return it.
1.0,I bought an xl but the size of the outfit will fit a person that wears medium.
1.0,Material was cheap and I sent it back.
1.0,"I liked the aesthetics of the ring, how unusual it was, and I was needing some blue jewelry. Unfortunately the minute I took the ring out of the package, the ball fell off. I tried to put it back in but was unsuccessful. Even if I had been successful, I would constantly be worried about losing it. Unfortunate because it’s a pretty piece"
1.0,"Absolutely horrible. Wrong color, size, shape, material, everything is false about this sweater. Don’t buy it! I only put one star because I had to."
1.0,Waist measured at 30” and the armpit / above the breast area is only at 32”....  maybe best for a smaller chested person.
1.0,TOTALLY SEE TROUGH!!!
1.0,Broke after first use. Looks cute but not durable by any means.
1.0,"Instead of the cute brown boots above, I received a pair of black mens Dr. Scholls shoes instead.  And I can't find a way to contact seller regarding this.  I'm super disappointed because I was looking forward to receiving these boots."
1.0,Get your own zip ties these will make you lose your luggage.
1.0,The color of shirt pictured is not accurate it’s more of a baby blue color
1.0,Color and design was spot on
1.0,"I loved the fit, feel and the fabric. I came back from my 2 business trip, to which I wore the skirt a total of 14-15 hours. All the seems strayed omitted this “hair” looking particles that feel rubbery to the touch(This is how I wore my during most of my business event) I looked at them and said when I get home I’ll try to shave them off with a sewing kit tool, a blade or scissors type. When I tried to pull these particles off they were attached and rubbery and wouldn’t come off. Whatever was used to sew the skirt together is a terrible fail. Back it went. No matter how much you want to spend, on amazon or higher end stores, quality is becoming more difficult to find."
1.0,"This is a pretty purse, but the quality is poor.  The zipper has never worked properly.  Even when it is completely empty, the zipper bursts open.  It took less than 1 month for the outside decorations to fall off.  Also, I have had it under 5 months, and the lining is shredding."
1.0,"Foxes have figured greatly in my family's life and so when I saw these I just had to have them. They are adorable! And so they immediately became My Favorite Socks. Unfortunately, they just as quickly fell apart. I have barely had them two weeks. I've worn them three, at most four times, and I think they've been washed twice at most--both times according to directions--yet they are coming apart. The fox face is separating from the rest of the sock on both feet. The &#34;seam&#34; has come loose for a distance of about one inch on the right sock, closer to three on the left."
1.0,this looked NOTHING like the pictures taken by other reviewers. not sure if those are fake ads from people working for the company or if I was just that unlucky to have gotten the ugliest fur vest in history.
1.0,"First of all, the picture in the description is photo shopped. But, for some odd reason, I still bought it. The provided size chart on the product page was off, and it ended up being about two sizes too large. I'm definitely returning this, but I can't help but blame myself for buying a photoshopped product."
1.0,They are not even close to the color advertised.
1.0,"Them didn't last one month. It began to appear stains on the lenses. Terrible quality, don't buy."
1.0,Would not fit or stay on anyone. Thin as ever. Shaped wrong. Very bad product. Can’t use at all
1.0,Very cheaply made.It was supposed to be a gift but no way!!
1.0,Not remotely waterproof and absolutely no indication that they were ever waxed. They're just regular shoelaces.
1.0,"I washed both pair when I got them. On one pair the rivet fell off and the tie went inside! The other pair only had the right-hand pocket. The left side was sewn shut! The quality just isn't like it used to be. Will not be recommending them to anyone, and not wearing them! VERY disappointed"
1.0,Waited almost 2 months to receive the shirt. Print quality is awful!!! Very dull and blurry. Now I'm stuck with the damn shirt because it was for a bday gift along with a ticket to the concert A MONTH AGO. Do not recommend purchasing from this seller. You would be better off with a sharpie and making one yourself.
1.0,The rose on the back is coming off already and it's been only 3 days!! The glue that holds it on is not very strong and it's awful that now I have to go back and fix something that should not be having an issue!!
1.0,It said plus size AND PLUS SIZE WHERE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT
1.0,I received 2sets of 2golf balls and pins instead the tank tops.... can’t wear at my gym.....😓
1.0,Returned not for me
1.0,"Poor quality.  And the shape/ fit was strange as the ruffles at the bottom fell in an awkward place ( I’m 5’6) , so it wasn’t very flattering.<br />Also, the material was like nylon/rayon and very stiff/not soft. Like a windbreaker material. Not great. :("
1.0,Looks frumpy. Definitely not my style
1.0,Not as tight as the compression socks I'm used to.
1.0,"Not recommended...<br /><br />The sizing length of the shirt I received is way off. I am 5'10&#34; tall and the shirt hangs way down past my belt-line and is much longer than my other shirts of the same size. It is for a tall person. There is no doubt my shirt is MISLABELED. The label shows the correct size, but the shirt is much longer. The seller disagreed. Now I have to pay extra to get it shortened so I can wear it. Spend a few extra dollars and avoid this potential problem with overseas sizing differences."
1.0,The pants were not true to size. Would not recommend.
1.0,"I did not realize when I ordered it that if returned it would go to CHINA and cost $23,00 to return"
1.0,Dress is super short and runs small. Not meant for chesty women either.
1.0,First and foremost this hat looks nice and fits nicely. But I think this was like a factory reject and someone bought it dirt cheap and resold it. This was made wrong the lid is misaligned looks crooked. No shaping makes this hat look any better. I attached some pictures and see for yourself.
1.0,I’m missing a pair of the three heart dangle earrings- I can’t figure out how to ask for the missing pair to be sent without having to send back the other pairs. I love the earrings and will change to 5 stars if I can figure out how to get the missing pair. I only got the pink and red 3 heart dangle earrings- the third pair is missing
1.0,It's so very small..
1.0,"With every open mouth deep inhale, I'm sucking in this fabric. It's disgusting. I can't breath properly even though it's thin. Plus it rides up my nose too easily & goes into my eyes. Yes, it's super thin, but it's just too tight. I suppose it is considered acceptable for the facial covering rules, but if you are someone who is worried about getting sick or getting someone else sick, don't wear this. For some wind/sun protection it's fine & that's what it's advertised for, not Covid. Personally, I need a looser face mask to be comfortable. I really hate this."
1.0,"The pants are super cute but the material is horrible.  So cheap . The one that sticks to your legs ,very staticky.<br />It fits perfectly on my waist but they are just way too long. Even the highest heels didn't help at all. The picture shows them as capry so I figured they will fit me as regular length pants but waaayy too long . Alteration is not worth it"
1.0,Extremely visible and obnoxious product info printed on back of right leg. Not mentioned in product description. I chose these for their simplicity and lack of large logo.  I would never have purchased them if I had known. I will return. Be advised!
1.0,Tight interior pockets (not even a phone will fit) made it unsuitable for me BUT leather is nice and construction good.
1.0,I received the watch but i worn it for some hours then noticed that the face had moisture in side the watch this is not good don’t trust that it will be water proof not very happy with this item
1.0,Cute but buckle broke after 1 day of wearing them!
1.0,"Not a typical UA hat. Built awkwardly, does not fit appropriately at all. Resembles an 80's trucker hat. Definitely not worth 35 bucks."
1.0,"These are NOT are not big enough for an adult’s face.  These are best for a toddler.  I returned my order and was charged $12 in shipping.  I feel totally taken.  Bad marketing, product is poorly made, and not worth my time or money spent.  Such a waste."
1.0,Very disappointed. The color is nothing like the picture. The purple wire piece doesn't even match the pendant. It says burgundy pendant. In the picture it looks young and colorful. My pendant looks looks like an old lady pale and drab. I really feel let down and ripped off.
1.0,This item is not as described the material is not stretch material... return label printed
1.0,AS ALWAYS CHINA SENDS WHAT THEY WANT TO SEND... NOT WHAT YOU ASK... BEWARE OF THEM!!!.. THESE PHOTOS ARE DULL... WITH LITTLE COLOR... NOT CLEAR... HORRIBLES!!!...
1.0,The toe box from the outside is ugly. They look much cooler in the photos unfortunately.
1.0,"The motor failed after only one year. Products that last one year should not be sold. Looks great, sat on a shelf and failed. I would have given it 5 stars if it held up."
1.0,Don’t leave in water
1.0,Not red line picture was more orange and had a hole in it. Order up a size I know body suit are suppose to be tight but hard to button because of length
1.0,"Dress runs big, buy a size smaller. Also hangs and looks like a nightgown. I am buying a belt to see if that will help."
1.0,Cheap cheap<br />Not gold is real cheap material.
1.0,Extremely disappointed 😞 in the dress.<br />It looks nothing like the photo.<br />Too short.<br />Material and design not what I expected.<br />Would like a refund.
1.0,I ask for an 3x size and got 2x small. I could hardly get them past my rear end.
1.0,I wore these leggings one time and they ripped in the butt. The rip is like a run in panty hose.  I ordered another pair in a different size thinking it was me but it they ripped as well.
1.0,It’s turning color I’m now happy about it :(<br />Please refund my money !!!<br />Thank you !!!
1.0,"These are so small, only a five year old could fit their hand through it. My skinny daughter could not get it past the first knuckles on her fingers.I suppose they would work if hung from a necklace."
1.0,I’m a size 18-20 so I purchased the plus sized version. They went on fine but they are very see through! Already started the return process..
1.0,"I am used to athletic socks from Costco, so was disappointed when these turned out thinner and smaller than I expected."
1.0,"The material is very cheap and stiff. Not what I was hoping for. Also, they are way too tight. Order a size or two larger than you normally would."
1.0,Tops very thin and toe chopped straight across with seam that is bothersome. Whore one pair and threw all in the trash..
1.0,This causes irritation to my skin
1.0,It was too small but when I tried contacting the company to return I did not hear back from them.
1.0,"Terribly thin, not sized correctly at all. Just all around a bad product"
1.0,The LED strip isn’t perfectly centered and the mask rips easily. The material used isn’t that great. I do not recommend and will be returning this item.
1.0,Loved the skirts but their sizing is too small. I ordered s medium and the one they sent even tho it said medium it was more like add extra small.
1.0,Has a super weird fit
1.0,"1. item came a day late<br />2. the picture is not reflecting the item; you are getting an impression which is overstating the feel of the item<br />3. the color of the bracelet is not as dark blue as the picture suggests<br />4, the plastic of the bracelet feels raw, and unpleasant on the skin<br />4a. the ergonomic Perlon bracelet feels real cheap<br />5. the pin for the pin buckle closure is too short, so you will have a hard time to close<br />6. The clock stopped on the second day I am wearing it."
1.0,Zero support. Not for my 34i bust
1.0,wth Merrell? all your new shoes are way too small.
1.0,I didn't realize it was just one earring
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8419ccf1b703cc0c4fb02aec36f250ce]] It didn't even last 2 weeks before peeling happened.
1.0,This product is a cheap replica of something I bought from a national superstore. Also ended up paying 4 times the price just because I was in love with these shoes and was not able to find my size and the color in the superstores website. My previous one lasted for 2 years and this one has started showing signs of damage within 6 months.
1.0,My hat arrived with a big tear on the front rim. The material looks fragile. I'm sending it back.
1.0,This shirt doesn't fit at all. It's way way too short to ever look good on anybody. I threw away $2 buying this shirt.
1.0,Fit as expected. Sweater matched the picture.<br />Cheaply made. Fabric is cheap and sweater easily got pulls and snags. Ended up having to throw out the sweater due to the amount of pulls from the cheap fabric.
1.0,Ordered 2 pair previously and loved them.<br />Ordered this pair and they are not made the same. Seem to stretch out easy and don’t stay up. Also seem to be made smaller than the previous order. Not consistent in production I guess.
1.0,Too big for a kid!
1.0,Sleeves were way too small.  The rest of the dress fit great but the sleeves were cutting off my circulation.
1.0,"I just got it and yet, I haven’t wear it is already fell apart. I don’t want to return it because is not worth my time."
1.0,These broke half way through my first day wearing them to work. Very sad because they are cute and comfy. But the strap just snapped.
1.0,"Good grief,  too long cheap filled with water certainly k no it like the old ones from years ago"
1.0,The earrings were way to heavy for your ears. They were pulling the holes down.  If you keep wearing them eventually you will never get to wear studs in those holes.  The studs will just go through the hole.  I wish they were lighter in weight.
1.0,Would of been a nice watch of it didn't turn color in a week
1.0,Way too baggy in arms..to return it would cost $15+ it's now a xmas gift
1.0,The material is of a poor quality and the sizes are inaccurate.  The more it stretches the more the purple changes to a white color and distorts the design patterns. Keep your money in your pocket.
1.0,Do not like the fit
1.0,"The watch was cute at first. It is for small wrists, not for big-wristed people like me- it was too tight but cute. It's very hard to adjust the time- I had to use my tweezers. I opened the battery compartment to see what kind of battery it uses, and it was impossible to re-close it. Had to return the same day."
1.0,Terrible product. No point to add the texting material because it is soo small you can barely press a button. Need to now purchase another pair because these are incompetent and ugly in person.
1.0,"The dress arrived a day before we left for our cruise. It was supposed to be red, arrived coral!!! Was supposed to be silk, arrived chiffon!!! Was so big in the chest area, there was making it work. It was a waste of money!!!"
1.0,It's a uniform not a casual shirt
1.0,"After reading the reviews I expected this dress to fit or run large. I ordered up a size and needless to say it was so small I could barely get it over my shoulders. No wonder it is so cheap, more than likely a return. Cute dress if you can get it on."
1.0,"Disappointed in the color, it's a much darker color. But the belt is nicely made I have many colors but if you're looking for a bright green belt this is not it, it's more of a very dark tree leaf green. Hope this helps"
1.0,"Do not waste your money. Product arrived extremely late, and was not as advertised! Ordered XL, but appears to be a Small"
1.0,Sent back we must of gotten a kids size because there is no way that was going to fit any adult
1.0,This dress feels like styrofoam and is very long.
1.0,"I purchased these in 6gs and am disappointed in the long post. The pics on the thread show a shorter back in a larger size but the post is so long they fall forward.. I like the larger size, but the 6g was disapointing."
1.0,Did not even get in the concert door before strap broke.
1.0,Tacky looking
1.0,"Color and fit are way off. It looks really cute in the pictures but nothing like that in person. This felt like a pillowcase, maybe a satin pillowcase."
1.0,This product is poorly made and very cheap quality. Doesn’t do much either.
1.0,Started peeling away within the first few minutes. Not worth it...
1.0,Only came with one. I didn't pay 6 dollars for one ear cuff. I want a refund or another shipped to me. Picture shows 2 ear cuffs as well as other customer review photos.
1.0,dont really work
1.0,Terrible fit. Maybe I got them too big? Ride up constantly. I may be at fault for not realizing they are French cut and not bikini.
1.0,Quite flimsy made. But I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,The size is ridiculous
1.0,"Well, they are official Nintendo products.  Seems I'm not the only one based on reviews to receive one or more broken clasps on these joycon attachments.  Maybe those terrible envelopes they get mailed in?"
1.0,"used as a prop for dance, all broke the first time through the routine. Cheaply made, looks cheap. We made it work, but I DO NOT recommend them"
1.0,"the first thing I noticed, was the cuff on left arm, the button was half gone.  The dress is not true to size.  I returned it."
1.0,I like the color....but the fabric and fit was not for me. It was too tight.
1.0,Material looked different and the length was way too long.  Had to return it.
1.0,"The picture shows a rather thick bushy scarf, where as the one that I received in the mail is very thin, more so than an average scarf. As well as the fact as it is extremely short and barely fit around my neck once, it did not look right, almost as if it had been shrunken and thinned from the original scarf."
1.0,What I ordered vs what I got :(<br />It fits much larger than I expected. Plus the material isn’t thermal like I expected…it’s more of a knitted material. There’s also an awkward flab on the back that reminds me of a penguin suit.
1.0,Sizing is ridiculous
1.0,I bought the largest size they had. Still way too small. I'm 6' and 220 pounds. Doesn't even have loops for the tiny little belt that's also 5 sizes too small. If you going to sale to America you gotta make them fit Americans. I got screwed on this but it's too much time and hassle to send back.
1.0,Was too small not true to size.. poor quality
1.0,not comfortable at all and constantly falls off
1.0,Hole in sleeve:(
1.0,"looks like all white, but are mixed colors"
1.0,THEY DON'T FIT MY ENTIRE CALF!
1.0,The lens fit well but the don't hold up. After about a month they started peeling and cracking. Would not recommend
1.0,Purchased in December for working out. Seams blew out in mid April.
1.0,"Poor quality.  The material is very cheap and has no body to it.  Thus, it hangs like a rag.  I would keep it for a nightshirt; but I think it would fall apart after a few washings."
1.0,Poor quality. Writing  unreadable.
1.0,"If you are using these for a kindergarten class, then they will fit fine; otherwise they are too small for any other size head.  The picture shows them on adult heads-thats not accurate.  Had to return as they were not usable for older children."
1.0,Disappointing ! Dial was too big. The strap won't go into the loops. The green light inside the dial was not that bright. I had to return this watch. Nice design though ☹️
1.0,"I love the look of this shirt, but whatever material it is looks cheap and thin."
1.0,The design on the front was too plasticy and it wouldn’t soften to relax the shirt
1.0,I like Invicta a lot however this particular watch was very flimsy and cheap it looked better online
1.0,The actual item was much lighter on color than it appears on screen.
1.0,Not for me. I don't like the fabric is too hot
1.0,The ring came scratched
1.0,The first order I returned to Amazon due to a 1.5 inch hole in the seam. The replacement order has a cut in the handle. I will either need to return or repair by sewing multiple zig-zag stitch in order to make the cut area stronger.
1.0,"This dress looks so beautiful, it came in and it looked like a Halloween costume. It is thick, hard material. The return was annoying as well. They try to provide you with a percentage back or to mail it, which costs a 1/4 of the price of the dress. Then it takes forever to be reimbursed. I would not order from this company ever again."
1.0,"This is for the black with white flower, ruffle wrap around dress! Really cute fabric and very lightweight for summer. I am usually a medium, but ordered a large so the wrap would have enough fabric to not show too much cleavage, but no such luck. The wrap came nowhere close to closing and the wrap opening went way down past the bottom of my bra in front. There is no way to even wear a normal bra with this, let alone wear it to church/work/family gathering. I wear a c cup, so shouldn’t be unreasonable for coverage. I don’t like to wear a shirt underneath, so I am returning. The waist and sleeves fit fine and the length was perfect. Way too bad!!"
1.0,Tiny and arrived very late
1.0,Strong broke immediately
1.0,In the description it was cufflinks and tie pins and I only received the cufflinks for both sets ordered. Gold and silver.
1.0,After a while of wearing these the ball breaks and eventually you won’t having any pieces left.
1.0,"The pants are quite comfortable and considering the tightness, that is a positive. However, the stitching is terrible. I didn't realize there would be this hideous detail that would be stitched in a cheap white thread emblazoned w/ THE embroidered 'GINGTTO'. EVEN WORSE, it goes all the way down the left front pocket, ' THE GINGTTO JEAN.' A potentially comfortable jean turned tacky. otherwise, I would presume if you decide to go with the purchase that you go one size larger just to accommodate the shrinkage that will result per washing."
1.0,"Nothing like the picture. The actual dress is something you would get straight from China on a site like Wish.<br />It's see through and needs a slip. It's very thin material, with no liner. There is no cinching around the top, it's more like a potato sack. And the small is about 2 sizes larger than it should be.<br />I don't recommend for anyone with a small frame.<br />I'm a size small, 0-2, 5'3, 112lbs."
1.0,They were broken before I could wear them
1.0,Terrible material and no support
1.0,if u want crappy shorts you will regret buying. look no futher..
1.0,This fits a 10 year old child.
1.0,BROKE IN 2 DAY!!! DO NOT BUY!! Believe the reviews!!! I didn't now i am going to get my money back because they are very aware of this problem!!
1.0,They’re not as thick as I was expecting...they’re only slightly thicker than regular socks and they’re not very warm either. The biggest con is that they’re so small!! They run so small that my kid who is a Little kid’s size 3 can wear these and they fit just right (see picture). Unless you’re a woman with tiny childlike feet then these are a hard pass.
1.0,"Cool graphic obviously,  but unfortunately on a low quality shirt that is itchy and has floppy sleeves. Also the graphic is just a stiff iron on. I had to turn mine into a cutoff for working out just to make it even remotely wearable."
1.0,"It says they are resin, but they are plastic and break very easy."
1.0,"No durable, not any of the things it claimed to be."
1.0,"Look nice, not great quality.<br />Took 2 months to arrive"
1.0,This was horrible. First off it didn't even come in the mail and I was giving it to a friend as a present.
1.0,"My item arrived broken and also looked dirty/old, not in a good way. Will likely throw it away also, waste of money."
1.0,it runs so small like this looks like a new born clothes smh
1.0,Halloween costume material.  There is no way this dress could pass for anything other than a costume. Poor Quality.
1.0,Just won't stick no matter what I tried. Very thick. If the curve doesn't match your glasses they won't work. Somewhat deceptive advertising. They are certainly not invisible. Just a large chunk of plastic stuck to your glasses. Sadly a waste of money.
1.0,Chain broke day one
1.0,I am very disappointed with this product not only it doesn't show the same as the picture but I found a maxi pad inside one of the zippered compartment of the handbag switch it tell me that this handbag is used..
1.0,"Runs extremely small, material a little uncomfortable."
1.0,Broke in less than 24 hours of me wearing it.
1.0,Looks like knock off printing not the same as in the pic looks very neat and not so bright orange
1.0,This product came with flower sitting in the package and one of the other flowers hanging by a thread on the sides of the headband. The leaves are also bent and raggedy looking.I am so disappointed because I really wanted for my 5yr old to wear this for her party.
1.0,The shirt is trash. Very thin material. Shirt printing was off and on another layer. Oops! Lol! Pants were play pants. Wouldn’t order or recommend.
1.0,I’m a reliable size 2 and the smalls were STILL a little snug. ZERO stretch. Started falling apart at the seams after sitting in a chair for 10 minutes.
1.0,My wife really liked this at first but within a couple of days the bracelet unraveled and She had to throw it away! Was very disappointed in the product!
1.0,"Um too tight, I gave them all away. They are tight in the waist but have a low crouch area so my inner thighs rubbed. So annoying"
1.0,Horrible bars didnt mold way to big cosplay only if u dont wanna talk
1.0,"I have the white, photocromic polarized version. I'm careful with this pair of sunglesses and have never dropped them or used any solution to clean them. I've used them probably 2-3 times a week at the most in a span of 1.5 years. I've owned rayban, bole, serengeti (glass lens), and other cheap 15-dollar glasses but I've never had lens peel like these corianos. The bottom edge of the lens each have about a 30mm long and 2mm high strip that's peeling. What appears to be peeling is some sort of darker-colored film. I don't know how much longer this will last but right now, I do NOT recommendd this model of glasses due to the poor quality of the lens. I still have my Serengeti Velocity gradient glasses since 2001 and the lenses, after having been dropped a few times, are still perfect except for a 4mm hairline scratch that you really can't notice. Thus, I expected the same quality on these Coriano's. Unfortunately, this expectation was not met. So, Serengeti Coriano or any other serengeti non-glass polarized lenses -NOT RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />Update May 28, 2013-Please take note of the lens &#34;technology&#34; used on this pair--the &#34;Polar PHD&#34; photochromic lens so I'd be very cautious about any of their products with this &#34;technology&#34;. May I also add that the photocrhomic lens are quite imperceptible because the &#34;light&#34; (vs. dark) setting doesn't get light enough to make it practical to use it in dark cloudy conditions so I end up just taking them off just as I would a non-photochromic lens."
1.0,La tela agarra mucha electricidad
1.0,Don't fit it's to big
1.0,Band very complicated to use. Watch stopped working about a week after i started using it.
1.0,"The band was too tight. Overall I'm a 12 and it was too snug, size large"
1.0,"It's a nice looking wallet and it holds a lot of stuff, but it doesn't work. I put my work badge in it and the sensor was able to read it easily and open the door. Back it goes."
1.0,"This runs SO small. I even ordered up. It is super short, and just terrible. Returning."
1.0,There is no way in hell that this was a XL . I couldn't even get it up one leg. And the color is off white or egg shell not the bright white i was expecting
1.0,I was not pleased with the quality.
1.0,The dsl is about the size of a small/medium.
1.0,Far too difficult to get on. Off to the second hand store with them. Waste of money.
1.0,The bottom is not easy to pull down as they make it seem. Not recommended.
1.0,"I bought two of these for my husband and I. They were very pretty, but the metal around them is sharp. That wouldn’t be too big a deal but my husbands fell completely apart in 2 weeks and mine in about 2 months.<br />Save your money!"
1.0,Sized much smaller than the standard sizing.. I gave it to my young daughter. Disappointed.
1.0,Not what i was expecting. Didnt fit right and would like refund
1.0,Just not enough card slots for me
1.0,Total crap. Seriously.  They don't work at all.  They don't even warm up.  The light doesn't turn on.  Literally nothing works. Complete garbage and waste  of money.  I was really hoping for some non chemical way to deal ice my locks as they always freeze over on my old subaru  but these are a joke.  Don't waste your time or money.
1.0,"wouldn't even give a one star!!! very, very disappointed!!! It is sooooo small !!! who its made for?!!! for a doll?!! its ONLY!! 13 inches around (neck)!! - THIS NECKLACE IS FOR A CHILD?  OR FOR  ANORECTIC (anorexia)  girls who's neck is 10 to 12 inches around. So shameful of them to sell it as for normal sized ladies  - I am size  M and couldn't even get it around....... five dollars to the drain ........ DEAR LADIES! DON'T BE FOOLED, DO NOT BUY IT (no matter how pretty it looks on picture)!  Sincerely and - it is the truth!"
1.0,Poor quality .. you have to tie nots to make a fit ok
1.0,It was extremely small. You can tell it was cheaply made. Would not recommend this to anyone. Not worth the money
1.0,This shirts buttons are made to cheap and fell off after wearing it a few times. Don't get me wrong the shirt looked nice. Its just made way to cheap for my taste
1.0,"I can't use the product because it won't spray, it just squirts a skinny stream. Thanks, Steve. (add on) I tried to use the product by squirting a skinny stream inside the crown by taking out the liner Because it was a stream and not a spray it soaked threw the felt and basically took the grey color out like it was bleached. I did in a sense follow the directions by using it in a inconspicuous place, inside the crown that would be covered up by the liner but it soaked threw and ruined the hat and it didn't even stiffen it much at all. I just bought a new one from Amazon. Thanks, Steve."
1.0,These flip flops leave your foot off to the side of the base making it uncomfortable to walk in. They look fantastic and have a super soft base but the placement of the thong is too off for me to wear. These are going in the donation pile.
1.0,"They broke, The hinges just pulled right out of the plastic"
1.0,No for this item ... Yes the seller sent me the second piece of it  after I contacted them after the first one got ripped off from back..  even the second one got ripped from back too while used 1-2 times ...the material & stitching is of poor quality ... think before you buy as this cannot be used for workout ... if it’s got ripped off while doing squat you might have to come home with underwear ..
1.0,"Tried many times to contact customer support to determine if these are polarized or not.  It says they are here on Amazon, but does not say on their site.  Customer service either didn't answer, or connected and then immediately disconnected.  Beware."
1.0,"material is very thin, seems are not sewn correctly pattern does not line up"
1.0,it looks like they do not have very good quality
1.0,"First they were late to get here, andthe material is so thin."
1.0,Poor quality fabric; tag had been removed! Sleeves seemed smaller than the rest of the top. Returned it.
1.0,These glove liners are SUPER CHEAP and see thru and lastest only one day with normal use. Way over priced for such a cheap and poorly made product.
1.0,Very bad I had to return it. Don't waste you're money.
1.0,These earrings are so cheap. You're better off going to Claire's. One was broken. On was bent. All of them are flimsy and the clasps hardly shut. Don't waste your money.
1.0,I ordered this and was very disappointed. It literally looks like a lab coat. I only gave it one star because I had to in order to post this review.
1.0,The suit measured with the measurements for a womens size 12!
1.0,The product is made of thin material that can tear very easily.  These pants were supposed to be used for work pants I didn’t even know when I saw the package that this is why it was in it because it was so thin. I’m very disappointed because it does not look like the picture on Amazon. If I wanted pants like what I order just now on Amazon I would’ve just wrap trash bags around my legs and my hips and it would have been just as good as the pants I ordered on Amazon. Very disappointed.
1.0,Garbage. Looks cheap and broke within a couple days.
1.0,"Aloha, no instructions came in the packaging with this, and I wanted to iron out packaging creases on low; must be 100% polyester and at lowest setting burned a hole right thru while barely touching the fabric. I am sooooooooooo disappointed. Didn't even get to wear it and now going in the trash can as the tip of my iron made a giant hole that will be totally noticeable if I wear it sewn up.  If you order this, make sure you have a thin towel between your iron and this blouse. It is extremely delicate to heat."
1.0,The stap was too big for the shoe size.
1.0,"This sweater had no labels, for washing instructions, no fabric content, and no manufacture label. Don’t know if it was new or used. Will not buy from this seller again."
1.0,If they we're the color I ordered would be much better there brown I hate brown but to much trouble to send back...oh well..TRAVIS
1.0,"Cheap and flimsy. Uncomfortable because the claps is cheap and presses against your ear lobe. Pearls are wiggly. One earring had 9 pearls, the other 8 so they weren’t even the same shape. One was more round, the other off round. Not worth bothering to return, so basically threw $10 in the trash. I have gotten my daughter kids jewelry from one of those gumball type machines for 25cents that was better quality than these."
1.0,"The product was poorly made and nothing like the picture in the listing. The dress color is a reddish orange at best and the seams were coming apart or loose. Large long stitches were hanging from the bust and under arm seams of the dress. Lastly, the material was very thin. Holding it up to the light I could see straight through. Very cheaply made."
1.0,"I loved these shades, great for the price. Until they snapped in the middle. They fell off the end table in my living room and snap. So bummed. Not very well made I’m afraid."
1.0,"The cable arrived on time, but it did not fit my Nintendo  DS lite as is stated."
1.0,There is no blue color at the bottom of the shirt at all.  It looks very plain compared to the picture.
1.0,"Material felt really cheap. I didn’t love the fit and decided not to keep it. When I took dress off, the strap broke. I haven’t heard from the seller and haven’t been able to return."
1.0,Don’t waste ur time or ur money!!!!!<br />  Bought a 14<br />Wouldn’t even zip<br /><br />Typically I wear a 12
1.0,"I would like to consider myself a pro at waist trainers and cinchers… so when I was given a discount in exchange for my review on this, I took the opportunity. FULLY REGRET THAT DECISION. This is probably the WORSE made faja/waist trainer I have EVER SEEN! First, the strap broke and the reason it broke was because the straps is an elastic band. The band is supposed to be of nylon tricot fabric which MOST BRA straps are made of. Nylon tricot does not stretch which holds the clips in place… but because these straps stretch… they stretched right out of those clips! They tried sewing the clips to the bands too (this is to deceive everyone) but like I said, the thread of the sewing SNAPPED because the bands are elastic! SO CHEAPLY MADE AND OBVIOUS!<br />Another issue – steel bone? What an insult! PLEASE READ THE DESCRIPTION.. It says steel bone, but then it says flexi-boning!! IT IS FLEXI-BONING EVERYONE!! FLEXI-BONING is COMPLETELY different than steel bone. FLEXI-BONING is more like a plastic flexible piece that keep the garment in place so it will not roll down. THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS! PLASTIC, NOT STEEL! AND A CHEAP FLEXI-BONE at that! It bends SO EASY!! IT NEVER stays in place. NEVER!<br /><br />I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN! This is such deception! I am SO HAPPY I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I would have been so MAD I paid $50 as advertised for this! SUCH A SCAM!"
1.0,Broke after 1st time I wore it.
1.0,"Do Not Buy, Its Ugly And Cheap. Pants to Big for A Medium and It's Not Worth Wasting Your Time."
1.0,This cover up was so long I need to return it. I’m not short 5’8” and it dragged the ground. So very disappointed.
1.0,"After following the directions to clean my Uggs, I was not happy with the results.  It did not clean the spots, and left the suede harder than before.  So now my boots are no longer soft, and they still have spots."
1.0,Does not say Atlanta Braves.
1.0,"Look cool, but bottom sole ripped open the first day my son wore them"
1.0,The material feels like rubber.
1.0,"The strap on one side would never ""click"" into place, so the fitbit was constantly falling off. Item was defective from beginning, but I didn't use it and realize it in enough time to get a replacement."
1.0,3 have already broke. I have not had them even a week. Bad quality
1.0,Sharp edges around ears
1.0,I bought this when doing Christmas shopping early thinking it was a sweatsuit for winter. It is not. The pants are thinner than a t shirt and the top is just a long sleeve shirt. So sad because I really needed this for cold weather and it’s too late to return
1.0,Pretty color (Wine) good fabric. Did not fit me properly (medium) just hung on me not flattering.
1.0,I noticed they don't come in wide I need a size 9 and i need wide.
1.0,Sweater was extremely to small
1.0,"I bought these in March and tried them on.  The fit seemed good but they smelled very strong of some kind of chemical.  I always wash new clothing prior to wearing so threw in washer.  They still smelled.  I washed them 4 times and hung to dry.  They still smelled.  I put them out on the clothes line for over a month now.  Rain, sun and wind has helped slightly.  I just took them down and washed 2 more times.  The smell is still there but will try them later this week and hopefully no problem.  I have compression socks that are very similar I purchased from another manufacturer on amazon.  They even have same patterns and colors as 2 pairs of these calf sleeves.  They never had any odor what so ever.  I should have returned them immediately.  Won't purchase again and highly recommend buying a different brand to others."
1.0,This product wouldn't fit  SIZE 4 I am  SIZE 8 always order a large in this style but this is ridiculously small
1.0,Tarnishes very  quickly and I don’t wear it in the water
1.0,Wasn't of money came with no diamonds just holes where they where supposed to go
1.0,Way too small and not flattering
1.0,"Terrible quality, the picture looks fuller than actual jacket. The jacket poor quality. Return it!"
1.0,Waste of money as soon as I washed it shrunk and I couldn't shape it to the original shape.
1.0,"This is not for a woman but a child, at least my granddaughter can have it"
1.0,Disappointed. Its way too big on my son and the tag was sewn on the outside of the shorts!!
1.0,Don't buy .To small and it's not loose
1.0,Very cheap(as expected) the necklace broke off after wearing 3 times. Don't waste your money
1.0,Top is not anything in picture. It is short and boxey
1.0,Terrible quality material. Fought me for a return label.
1.0,"dangerus, it presents many ripples. don't buy."
1.0,Not for kids. The strap is way to big
1.0,Quality of hat is OK but thought it was embroidered only to find out its an iron on patch...
1.0,Pretty top but it ran small so I gave it my neice
1.0,"Cute shoes, but they arrived damaged. Only one shoe lit up"
1.0,I ordered an Xl and it wouldn’t even go over my shoulders
1.0,The sizing is way off.  I ordered a medium.  The waist band is tiny like it's a small but the thighs are huge as in XL!  Sending back.
1.0,Ring broke before I left the house with it on.
1.0,If there was zero stars I would give it to zero read reviews so ordered an extra large I wear a size 6 dress this thing doesn't even close frustrated and disappointed nice fabric not made a horribly but the sizing is a joke obviously made overseas for little people
1.0,"Not as pictured, don’t be fooled"
1.0,Runs very small. Doesn’t fit or look like the photo. I returned the one I ordered
1.0,Too small for my cartridge so I won't be wearing them the pictures made them look bigger
1.0,"Came with no pins or tool to open the clasp, which makes it useless. How are you supposed to use a watch band with no pins? Moto 360 bands do not have removable pins. The idea is to be able to switch out bands easily, so bands always have the pins in them. In fact it's just common sense. Shame on the seller for not making this clear in the product listing! Definitely NOT happy."
1.0,"If I could rate it zero stars I would. The absolute biggest waste of $20. If you wear the small size Fitbit band, do not bother. Only clusters of links are removable, making it extremely difficult to size to smaller wrists. Would be better if each individual link were removable like a NORMAL watch band. Again, would not purchase again. Complete waste of money."
1.0,These came folded over in a shoe box and was made of the cheapest (not leather) material known to man… there is absolutely no way these could ever be for practical everyday wear… I returned them immediately…
1.0,"Unfortunately, this was an epic fail. Out of the packaging, this item had a horrible plastic smell. You could see immediately that the glue holding the rubber mask portion to the foam was coming apart and dark brown in many areas. The antenna is too big to fit into its slot on the side of the head, making it unusable. When the helmet is put on the head, it doesn't even cover the chin -- you would have to have a really small head to make this work. Also, it is very tight. I'm a fairly small woman, and this was way too tight for me. This would probably work for a child, but wouldn't recommend whatsoever as the smell is so chemical-like, there is no way it could be healthy to wear this for too long. After removing the helmet, my lip and face started to itch, and I developed red bumps all over. I'm assuming it's an allergic reaction to the materials, which has never happened to me before when purchasing masks. Overall, this item is not only poor quality, but seems to be unsafe as well. Cannot recommend and will be returning."
1.0,"I had such high hopes for this dress, but it was a big fail. When I pulled it down around my torso, I thought, Okay it's a little loose but not bad. Then I got it all the way on and realized that I could make two skirts out of all the material on the bottom. It's sooooo huge.  Not only that, but the waist sits high (I'm only 5'4&#34;) and then balloons out making me look 5 months pregnant. I honestly don't understand all the glowing reviews."
1.0,Nothing like expected...cheaply made.
1.0,Dress is not lined<br />Seam is not straight<br />Tried to return but they would not take it back
1.0,[[VIDEOID:384ce5e9cf68ae9fce29d5a6a221a4d2]] This item arrived damaged
1.0,"Do not buy. Horrible quality. The sticking was a different color, crooked, and the thread was way too thick. I returned mine the second I opened it."
1.0,the purchase was safe and very fast shipping. Product horrible! not recommend
1.0,The ring is shiny and the band is THIN. It's not ugly but it is nothing like the pictures.
1.0,"The rain has finally come in seattle. This was my first opportunity to test this suit out. And unfortunately I'm sorry to say that even with a slight drizzle you cannot stay outside for more than 10 minutes before the water soaks through drenching my clothes underneath. Not to mention this fabric is not breathable at all, so it cannot be used in spring either otherwise you get wet from the inside out. I made a mistake keeping this suit and returning the other I bought. Don't make the same mistake."
1.0,This was a Christmas gift disappointment. I ordered it and it became unavailable. Had to do alternate gift shopping for the little girl.
1.0,Such crap. Very thin cheesy fabric you can’t put this on and wear it. I bought it for my daughters birthday party. It’s garbage don’t waste your money
1.0,"Maybe it's cause of the color, but I could see my skin thru the fabric. I do not recommend this leggings (at least not this color)."
1.0,"This item shrunk after first wash.  So even though it was exactly what I needed, it wasn't worth the purchase because it is now unwearable for me."
1.0,Cheep and tarnishes
1.0,Returned!  These run very small.
1.0,Some of the posts are leaning instead of being straight. They are glued on crooked and some of the posts have sharp burrs on the ends. The glue blobs on the back are not uniform in size or shape.<br /><br />They were cheap so I will chunk them into my craft box and use them for something else.
1.0,Shirt is cheap quality. Sizes are way small  and short. The image is low quality as well.
1.0,Bought for my husband.  Less than impressed
1.0,As soon as I opened the package the seahorse was detached from the rest of the anklet.<br />BUMMER!
1.0,Got these to wear to my sisters wedding as MOH. They were as big as my hand. When wearing they touched my shoulder lol
1.0,You only receive two out of three leggings pictured. Misleading picture and it wasn’t evident that you would only receive two out of the three colors that are given.
1.0,"This is glitter, not sewn in sequined. It's cute, but the glitter falls off and is everywhere."
1.0,"This product was perfect at first. It looked professional, was comfortable, didn't accidentally disconnect, and was easy to install and adjust. After wearing it for a few weeks a few links broke. This wouldn't be a big deal except there is sharp metal poking everything now. I didn't realize what was going on until I snagged my work dress, sweater, and bed sheets."
1.0,Item fits like a medium. It does not stretch like spandex as stated in description. Need plus size options.
1.0,The fit is very loose... and doesn't maintain the shape...
1.0,This product is poor quality and designed to tear easily. The material is not what you would expect. I purchased multiple colors and all have been returned.
1.0,"Too small, NOT true to size."
1.0,the fabric is cheap.. returned it.
1.0,"These pins are awful, if you’re looking for enamel pins these are NOT it! The quality is that of a 6 year old with a hot glue gun. Even in the padded box they fell apart from the pin. Just a small dab of cheap glue holding them together.<br /><br />Not to mention some of the images in the reviews are COMPLETELY different from the actual product, this is most definitely a scam!"
1.0,Horrible fit and quality
1.0,I don't think the the bracelet is worth the money!
1.0,Defect and does not work. Hope i can contact the seller.
1.0,Wayy to small for Hoops.<br />I can barely put these in my ear
1.0,Not form fitting
1.0,The material are very poor.
1.0,"Doesn't fit right, NO response from company and it does NOT have the same metal latch that the watch originally had, but a tacky belt buckle-like thing.<br />Very disappointed that it doesnt work, doesnt have a proper fastener and more disappointed that the company apparently doesn't care one way or the other, they obviously just want our money because they have not responded to me."
1.0,So I got those watchband because I thought let’s try this nylon one since my garmin one broke. It was ok for about a week and then one side starts popping off.<br /><br />Just spend the $48-50 on the garmin replacement band. This thing is horrible.
1.0,It’s really thin! I’m short and the sleeve still don’t come all the way down!
1.0,Way too tiny!!! waste of money. Will not fit most men!!!!
1.0,I would not purchase this brand again.  The ink was blotched in several areas. You get what you pay for.
1.0,Cheap. Never again.
1.0,This necklace turned my granddaughters neck green and she broke out in a rash so I would advise you not to purchase this.
1.0,"Pattern didn't match, cheaply made."
1.0,The battery was already halfway dead upon arrival
1.0,Fit too tight to my head (my head is an average size... most hats fit fine). But the worst part is that the dye stained my white linen pillow cases! I tried washing it (the cap) a few times but it continued to do so. Into the trash it went.
1.0,"Buyer BEWARE. The hoodie is super thick material, very bulky, not flattering at all. Think your high-School boyfriend’s hoodie. None of this would be a problem if you could actually return the item. However the seller requests that you return it to a Canada address on your own dime. It will cost you more to send it then the actual item costs. Complete scam."
1.0,I am pretty disappointed in these clip-ons.  The cheap plastic lens fell out the first week while cleaning them.  Donm't waste your money.
1.0,Returned these due to the fit. I ordered a small and it was like an extra large. Very very puffy fit. Unfortunate the color was nice but style was not at all what I was looking for.
1.0,This is my second time purchasing these as my first set was stolen when I left it in the shopping cart at the supermarket.  I was shocked when I first used this set because the straps just ripped right off the bag.  I ordered 4 bags in total two sets of two.  Out of the four 3 broke with my first couple of uses.  The first set I bought a few years ago were indestructible.  I am not sure if it’s a different manufacturer or handle material but it did not hold up.  I never overload these bags and never put heavy items in them.  I could’ve gotten a defective batch but decided to just get a refund instead of a replacement.
1.0,It works good but it smelled horrible when i opened it
1.0,Bracelet is nice however it keeps falling off.<br />Latch is not secure.
1.0,"So the dress itself fit fine. I just read another review that said they thought the dress might be backwards. Based on all the reviews I went with a XL, I could not even get my top half in. It did fit better worn backwards but, come on."
1.0,"So bad I will give it zero stars, won't stay in place, can't pin it in place very low quality."
1.0,They do not secure to foot.
1.0,"No support in the top, and bottoms fit weird."
1.0,Too thin and big on foot
1.0,I wear so and ordered this 2x to wear loosely and it's tight!
1.0,"Poor quality,  I'm keeping it because it was cheap."
1.0,This was a hot mess… doesn’t look like the shirt dress at all… be aware of overseas items. The material was cheap and thin. Never will I buy from them again.
1.0,Not same color as shown. Not worth 10$.
1.0,"My negative review is not for the Magic Rack itself. These racks work great and do exactly as advertised. I used them all the time at my friend's house and that's what caused me to want to buy them. But they tried to sell me a repackaged, USED set of racks.<br />I opened the plastic bag and right away, the first thing I notice is a huge crease on the 8-ball rack. Like it was folded over or something. This caused me to inspect them further and sure enough, with the right light, you can see tons of abrasions all over BOTH racks and even a few other nicks and bends. Clearly these things were used/abused and returned then just thrown loosely into a zipper bag and restocked.<br />I wouldn't even mind if they were used (and not bent) if they were advertised as such and a little cheaper. Throw a couple of bucks off and tell me they're ""refurbished"" and I would be happy. But I bought brand new racks. That's what I paid for and these clearly are not. I sent them back for an exchange and we'll see how that goes. If I get another set of used racks, I will be done and try ordering them straight from the manufacturer or going to my local billiard supply because again, they are good racks."
1.0,The sleeves and pants legs were impossibly long
1.0,"This item appeared to be a decent size but when I got it, item was extremely small. I was very disappointed. I’ll never buy from this vendor again."
1.0,This dress was beyond bad.Poorly made.The cut was terrible.It looked nothing like the ad to buy.
1.0,I hate it poorly made they should be a-shame of themselves selling something like that. I really didn’t want to give a star but I had to so that I could write this review.
1.0,So terrible. Bad quality cheap terrible.
1.0,"THIS DVD WILL PROBABLY NOT PLAY ON YOUR MACHINE.  It is in PAL format, not in NTSC.  The Amazon listing is in error."
1.0,"I work for Budweiser and thought these gloves would be great for rolling beer , they didn’t even last a week. The rubber is already worn out in the palms and the fingertips have worn down to the material."
1.0,If you want something tiny TINY TINY then these are for you
1.0,Please they don’t work
1.0,"Not sure what to say, but a horrible experience.  I also didn't know that I have to pay ~$5 to ship item back for return.  60 days worry free is something that future buyers need to worry about.  I bought this for my Canaveral sunglasses.  Left side fit perfectly, while the right side is not. The photochromic is not dark enough for a bright Cali sun, so I had to re-install 580G lens back.  This lens apparently has no AR coating, and this is causing headache while driving as the back lens reflects crazily due to Aviator stlye.  The positive thing about this lens is that it isn't polarized, and somehow make an object bigger/closer.  I don't think it's an RX, but feels that way. $50 though... might be an incentive for other lens companies to charge far more due to comparative competition.  That is my biggest worry."
1.0,"I am 6'3"" 220lbs and purchased a XL.<br />This jacket seemed more like a medium,  sleeves were 6"" to short and jacket was tight.<br />Return policy is definitely a hassle and they will not refund you for the jacket. They said keep it and will refund $40 or send it back for another jacket, at your own shipping cost. Guess I'll be ordering a xxxl if a xl was like a meduim.<br />I'd look elsewhere for a similar jacket with a better fit definition and return policy."
1.0,The shoes didn’t last long. Started shedding string around the edges right away and that made them look old and used but they where only a few weeks old
1.0,Was falling apart when I got it.
1.0,I know my shoe size. And so I got the size I wear. And they gave me a shoe size that is wayy too small. Like a complete size smaller.
1.0,Does not fit to size.  Zipper broke first wear.  Only allowed 30 return window. Not impressed.
1.0,Bigger than they look online I even measure them and they are a little bit bigger then they say
1.0,Horrible. Didn’t fit right at all and very see through. Returned right away.
1.0,These look like adult diapers on real people. I followed the size guide and was pretty disappointed in them. I honestly don’t know how the model in the picture looks so good.
1.0,"dont buy these. they’re cheap plastic and literally look so ugly. as soon as we pulled them out of the bag, we knew immediately these would be sent back."
1.0,First of all the dress fits all kinds if wonky the size is definitely off. it is made for short torsos. so if you have a longer torso this dress is not for you. the material is a little cheap but would have worked fine hadn't fit. I went through amazon to process the return. I requested the return and was told I needed to wait for up to 5 days to receive the shipping label. Today I receive the refund of $5.35 for something I paid over $86 for and was never worn. I tried it on once. I think it's not very fair for Amazon to allow the return to be processed but then the seller to refund on pennies on the dollar. Watch out would not buy from them again.
1.0,It's a little too big for what I wanted and it definitely feels like PU leather rather than real genuine leather. It's going back...
1.0,Horrible. I bought these not even a month ago and wore them 3x and they are already falling apart. I never write reviews but these are a rip off!
1.0,Made my daughter ear swollen after first wear
1.0,"I received this top today.  I was very excited.  BUT....  The back of the dress really sucks.  The pattern is not matched on one side.  I will be returning it and reordering today.  Hopefully it was just a bad batch.  $26.00 is way to much for a top put together like this.  I have bought better quality at a certain store, starting with a W, for half that amount.  Not happy but willing to try again."
1.0,This coat lasted about 2-3 days before it completely fell apart. I returned it immediately. The Zipper splits and all of the zippers and buttons are EXTREMELY Low Quality. Don't Buy this jacket. I promise you will thank me later.
1.0,"Just don’t, no appropriate fit poorly made"
1.0,Not the same product. Fell apart after 2 wash.
1.0,Clip broke right off had to reglue it  made cheap
1.0,"I specifically purchased from Burton because they are (or used to be) known for quality.<br />I received my zip up hoodie on time and nicely packaged, but WITHOUT THE HOODIE DRAW STRING.<br />I called Burton about this and they told me that I had to return the item and order a new hoodie.<br />The only other option was to leave a review, so I did that.<br /><br />A very disappointing experience. Maybe Burton is no longer a top tier company.<br />There are other companies that would have handled this better, like putting a drawstring in an envelope and sending it out.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd shop elsewhere. If your next Burton hoodie shows up sans drawstring, remember I told you so.<br /><br />Respectfully,<br />Rick Schultz<br />Lakemoor, Illinois"
1.0,"Not what I expected. Did not match up with photo. I received solid wine shirt. Photo shows grey/wine, which is what I wanted"
1.0,The description say this is longer than regular gloves but I measured them and they are exactly the same.
1.0,the fabric tore the first day I wore it !<br />now i have a shoe with a rip and they do not even have a new one to replace it with
1.0,I had ordered a Youth Medium.  When it arrived it looked like a 4T.
1.0,After 2-3 uses
1.0,"Description says Cotton but it is NOT soft. Sizing chart is not correct. This company needs to visit the Hanes facility, see what they are doing right. Nice colors."
1.0,"Hard to put together, as I never was able to secure beck on hat, and most of sticks did not light up."
1.0,The pink shirt is a horrible orange color!
1.0,"While the gloves are soft, they are also flimsy.  I purchased 2 pairs and after the second use of one pair, one of the flaps had come off and the botton as well.  After the 4th use of the other pair, the flap is coming off and both buttons are gone."
1.0,Why are people shocked that this doesn’t come with the clothing? It literally says it’s not included in the product line. Try reading.
1.0,"This crop top has less coverage than my sports bra. Great material and beautiful color, but doesn't have the length to come close to high waisted leggings."
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Fits small.
1.0,Run so small. So disappointed. It is such a cute skirt.
1.0,If you have a large face these might work on you but I do not and they looked absolutely ridiculous. Way too big for me!
1.0,They all came apart ..I would like a refund !!!!
1.0,Waste of money.....didn't fit...bought 2.
1.0,Very cheap looking and the lace doesn't match.  I returned it.
1.0,They are nice gloves but I had to send them back because they were defective.  I could not get my small finger in the slot made in the left glove.
1.0,I ordered a size up from what I would have gotten which was a XL sit me like a Small . Not flowy. Very short in the front and back
1.0,It came broken so I couldn't use them
1.0,Broke after trying them on once! Don’t buy! Made very cheaply!!!
1.0,It broke the second time I wore it!  Beautiful watch band but one elastic band broke and the beads flew everywhere 😞 so disappointing
1.0,If I could give these a negative review I would. I ordered 2 masks and they are horrible quality and two completely different sizes. One is to small and one falls off my face because its so small.
1.0,fits like a kids (toddler) necklace
1.0,The chain broke the first week. I had one very dissapointed 13 year old. This is not a good choice for a gift.
1.0,Waist of money. Felt ruff and didnt fit
1.0,Not what I thought it would be.  It came all tangled and knotted up.  I returned it.  Thanks but no thanks.
1.0,I was expecting these earrings to look cute ... waste of money
1.0,I thought the quality of the product was over rated.  They barely lasted three months.  I am requesting a refund on this item
1.0,I am returning this dress... the material is 100% see through all over. Itchy/cheap fabric and the front does not look like that.
1.0,"runs way too small, XX large is okay for a 5 year old child."
1.0,Very cheap quality and the color is off.
1.0,Fit of the dress was as expected. Washed in cold water as per washing instructions but the white because tainted from the red . Not cool at all . One wear was not what I expected
1.0,Watch does not work. Don't want the hassle of returning it. I'll eventually check the battery.
1.0,It looks nothing like the pictures when you put it on. Think of a satine sheet with three holes sewed in it. The arm holes are the same size as the head hole. I'm 5'1 180lbs and no matter what I do I can't make this shirt look good it just hangs. I look like a beige ghost. Nothing sexy about this shirt. If I hold my arms out you can boob not side boob full boob shot.
1.0,Idk if there was a size option that I missed but the glasses I was sent could possibly fit a toddler.
1.0,Very small.  I gave them to my son's GF as a gift.  She is very tiny and the fit was perfect.  I think the small size is for dolls.
1.0,Nice bras love the design but runs small the 3x didn't seem to be a 3x very Tight!
1.0,The zipper broke on the first packing cube I tried to use.  Returned and decided not to get a replacement.  I was using this for a trip and the replacement would have been delivered while I was on vacation.
1.0,I used their sizing chart and what we got still didn't fit. But I did manage to get it to fit one of my nieces tho.
1.0,These pants are cheaply made and are way too baggy for tights
1.0,This shirt is made of thin material and cheaply made. It has stitching at the hemline to simulate a hem that does not truly exist. For $21 you should receive at least a package of 3.<br />I do not recommend.
1.0,COMPLETE HORSE $H¡T ! ! ! !<br />My man got me this for valentine's day & is NOTHING like it is advertised ! ! ! !<br />Cheap rubber with foam on the inside to make it smell so bad & not AT ALL the material that is described.<br />IF YOUR GONNA RIPE OFF STAR WARS AT LEAST GET THE COLORS RIGHT ! ! ! !
1.0,"I REALLY wanted to like these, and I rarely leave truly negative feedback.  I live on the beach and wear flip-flops 95% of the time.  Out of the package, they look fine.  But once I put them on, they were just odd.  I always wear a men's size 10 in flip-flops... I never even have to try them on while buying anymore, they just always fit.  These seem to have the toe-strap placed too far back.  This means that my foot hangs over the back edge, while I have an extra 1-1/2"" of ""shoe"" sticking out front.  I can force my foot in forward a little more.  This makes the top strap too tight, and after a few minutes, the shoe still slides forward again on its own.  Yes, there are nice features as described, such as an inset heel and raised arch, but this does little good if you can't keep your foot in the right position.  They are neither soft nor comfortable.  They are just extra thick rubber flip-flops... hardly worth the price.  If they were more comfortable, I might have considered ordering a larger size, but then they would look like thick skis because I'd probably have even more ""shoe"" sticking out in front.  I was so excited to get them that I threw the packaging away in the mail room.  Dumb on my part.  If I kept the packaging, I'd undoubtably return them."
1.0,"I ordered a toddler size 12. The shoes came as a ""14"" with a size 12 sticker on them. The shoes are way too small and really tight on her feet; she is still in a 12 shoe...."
1.0,"Bought these for pulling thorn vines,  took me two months to finally get around to using them and found they are useless against thorns."
1.0,Came with a stain.
1.0,junk the ripe as soon as you put on
1.0,"It was certainly well made, as I would expect from the name, but otherwise it was useless. Three tight card slots and enough room to hold a couple of bills. Took one look and returned it."
1.0,Received item in the mail to find out it was only one necklace in the box when it’s supposed to be two….very misleading
1.0,Disappointed in these. I got them to fasten my cardigan sweater with but they didn't hold. I would only recommend these for a thin neck scarf....
1.0,I feel in love with them until I put one together wore it for a day and the latch fell off. I thought it was just that one defect until I purchased three bundles and made bracelets to purchase. My customers bracelets fell off because the latch.
1.0,"I put this on and felt like I was in a oneself, the proportions were not there. The torso was way to small and the arms were too long. The fabric also looked like a cheap wetsuit. It's not for me."
1.0,"Ordered XL bexause of reviews, wrong it was to big. The material is thin would return it due to size and buttons."
1.0,"Maybe when she wears a size 8'thesenwl got her. But at as size 5, no way!"
1.0,I have a real stainless steel chain and this one is not even close it's a weak imitation I don't even want my money back it's a waste of time
1.0,Not well made. The front cut is not in line and just poorly made. No packing slip included so I did not realized I had brought it from Amazon. I cannot wear it but unfortunately I had thrown out the package. Waste of money.
1.0,ery thin material
1.0,They are beautiful earrings but the backings were too large and the earrings would just fall out of ear. I had Have a replacement order too because it didn’t deliver the first time. The second time it was sent I got a pair that just were not up to the standards of an earring. At that point I wasn’t waiting another three days for another pair to be replaced. Don’t order not worth it.
1.0,"very cheap feeling, not soft"
1.0,Fell apart in less then a week...
1.0,"Very disappointing, the material was thin and flimsey and did not fit right.  I ordered a size large thinking the larger size would fit but I was wrong.  The large fit like a small, and I usualy take a medium in dresses.  Poor quality."
1.0,"It’s HUGE! I usually wear a large but after reading reviews, went with a medium. I still can’t wear it because the arm holes are MASSIVE!! Just wanted to warn others… it’s an adorable dress but way longer than expected and even after sewing the sides a little smaller… I just can’t find any confidence in this dress. Save your money and find something else :("
1.0,"comes way too small. looks better in the picture. gave it away as sending it back would cost more. hard to iron as well, very wrinkled after the first wash. forget it"
1.0,"Beautiful design and colors.<br /><br />We needed slippers for the summer and water.  When my daughter wore them to the beach and pier, the extended walking caused rubbing and welts between her toes and along the “arm.”  Rubber is like the classic slippers, the kind I used to wear  as a kid and get chafing.  I know some people have no issues wearing a variety of footwear, but it didn’t work for us.<br /><br />We will use them for around the house slippers."
1.0,They look super cute but are cheaply made.  One of the earrings broke the first time wearing them.
1.0,"This is not as the picture shows. This is not flowy chiffon, but some cheap polyester. It looks like I'm wearing the top of a set of scrubs. Boxy. Awful."
1.0,Wore it for a couple weeks then the material separated from itself.  Def disappointed in the durability.
1.0,"Pockets on a shirt might be cute but, to me just look awkward and bulky at the bottom. I’m already a little fluffy lol and it makes my stomach look larger than it is. The fit was great, material super soft. (145 ordered MD and it was loose). Would have loved it if it didn’t look so awkward at the bottom."
1.0,"Very Bulky and really big, the tag says XXL. Wish I could return it"
1.0,"Was very small chain, seemed cheap!"
1.0,This necklace was way bigger than it looked in the picture. The picture makes it look dainty but that’s not the case at all!
1.0,"Very weak material, they bend every single time I put them on.  No matter how gently I put the backs on.  They turn while being worn."
1.0,Tela muy fina transparente
1.0,Kappa Alpha Psi is not a sorority. It is a fraternity.
1.0,received my regular size but to my surprise this is more for child sizes.  Please be advised.  Thanks
1.0,These pants arrived to me dirty and stained.  Disappointing.
1.0,Actual bracelet looks NOTHING like the bracelet I received :(
1.0,I received a dress that wasn't even the same one in the picture. It was a off the shoulder ruffle dress. And it's made from a cheap fabric. It looks like a pillow case. I don't suggest buying this.
1.0,"I put these on for the first time today and within two hours of doing the ever strenuous task of sitting at my kitchen table and teaching my kids, I found these two lovely holes. I didn’t snag them on anything or sit on anything rough but lo, holes.<br />Two other things to note: these leggings require hand washing and are a dark print over a white fabric so anytime the fabric is stretched (over a bent knee for example) the pattern lightens."
1.0,Horrible material too big ordered large and extra large as that’s what the sixties says both too big not happy
1.0,Felt loose when I first took them out of the box. They did not last long at all.
1.0,Horrible quality. Many stones off when receivedcsnd several fell off while being tried on indoors. If thus was a $5 product I would expect but not almost $20. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Waste of money. Material tore
1.0,Hideous! Cheap looking plastic of the worst quality! And I am not sure what all the &#34;runs small&#34; is about. I followed the recommendations to order it bigger and it is HUGE!! Don't waste even as little as it costs - it is going straight in the donation bag!!
1.0,Looks alright not very comfortable. Wanted the blue denim ones but they didnt have my size..... anyway they'll have to do.
1.0,"Unfortunately I had to return because the fit was so strange. It fit well on the waist and hips but then flared out on the thighs and were too loose. I don't have skinny legs and can even be considered thick legged, so for the shorts to fit so loose on the thighs made the fit look weird."
1.0,"Compre este brasier en 34c y me quedo grande, el brasier no tiene esponja pero si barilla"
1.0,Did not like it was too big tried to return
1.0,No va con la talla que pedí y el material da picazón
1.0,Very cheap quality!  Will turn green in a few days
1.0,"These pants are absolutely terrible. I wore them twice and the gold came off!! All over everything; my hands, where I sat, whoever touched them. And the smell when I took them off was horrible. I smelled it the first time I wore them, had them cleaned and thought I'd give it another shot... WRONG. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1.0,Would not recommend. Poor quality.
1.0,They are so thin you can see everything! I’m most upset that the patern doesn’t even line up. It’s like having mismatched leggs.
1.0,Very low quality product. Would not recommend to anyone
1.0,Dress came with a missing strap
1.0,The tshirt was very short and the sizing runs very small
1.0,"Worst buy ever, they came all twisted, unassembly and when I tried to assemble them they broke 😑😡😠.<br />I don't recommend this product never  ever!!!"
1.0,Only good if you are thin
1.0,Not attractive. Leaves lint everywhere.  Not worth the price.  Skip it. Look for something better.
1.0,"Not what I expected, the sliver wore off of them after 5 days unsure as to why. Very cheap and difficult to put on, can't get the shape back to a circle.. nothing like the other ones I've bought from other places!"
1.0,Fits VERY SMALL
1.0,"I always wear large hoodies with never any issues when washing them I got a bunch for Christmas washed them all with no shrinkage, This hoodie was the most expensive one and it shrunk to to a medium borderline small I couldn't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer looked like a damn fabric softener compared to the other hoodies, If you're going to get it get a size bigger or just don't get it, I was going to order one again but I can find alot better hoodies for cheaper than this,Where's the quality at??"
1.0,This dress was returned the moment I looked at it.
1.0,It fits like a moo moo...it’s nothing like the picture
1.0,"These pants are not typical Gramicci pants.  I ordered them for my husband who has owned Gramicci pants for about 15 years - he's worn at least 5-7 pairs of these pants.  The belt is very cheap and not the same material that they usually use - broke upon the first wearing!  Luckily, Amazon made a return very easy, but we were very disappointed with Gramicci for the first time.  Kind of sad."
1.0,"All over the last few months I have had 3 of these, the 8928OB stopped working and amazon replace it. The second after out return window started losing time. It's now garbage because I broke it trying to adjust the time. The 8929OB gained time from the get go. Now it's gaining about 18 minutes per night. Yep opened er up got it slowed down but still gains. Ive had it.  I believe these were both Japanese made. They look great but don't run accurately enough for me."
1.0,Everyone of them turned brown after two weeks
1.0,Bought this for the wife. She wore is less than a week and the stitching is coming apart on the sleeve.<br /><br />Spent a little more and get something better.
1.0,"The doctor was convincing that this flip flop would take the pain away, it didn’t. In fact it added to the pain. I don’t recommend these if you have plantar fasciitis. I do recommend Strutz, found at Walmart. I spent months in pain wearing these flip flops and only two days to become pain free with Strutz, only $10.00."
1.0,I normally order a size 9 in this style. Decided to order a 9.5. When the shoes arrived ~ the inside was stamped with 9.5 but they were smaller than my size 9 shoes.
1.0,Way too small and too childish looking.
1.0,"Cheaply made, and exactly what everyone else said about the lace on the back. It doesn't lay flat, it sticks straight out which makes it impossible to wear unless you don't mind looking crazy. Im 5'2, 120 lbs with a normal back"
1.0,Ordered a small and still way too big! It fits like an oversized trash bag.
1.0,The necklace came jammed in a small ziploc bag. The clasp was on the wrong side so it is totally impossible to wear. I made an attempt to move the clasp to the correct side to I could wear it. The chain links were really flimsy and easy to pry open. Once I tried it on it was so tight I couldn’t clasp it closed without it choking me. I don’t remember to picture portraying it being a choker because I wouldn’t have ordered it. It is impossible to wear and because it’s so cheap I won’t return it. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"These weren't actually made to fit real people. I would have to be missing most of my pelvic bone to fit into these. There is just no room in them. Also, they are paper thin, no room in the thighs either, and even if you do get them on they ride up as you walk."
1.0,Can’t even wear these. Feels like a canvas tarp.
1.0,"In person, this show is much more cheap looking than I expected."
1.0,"junk, it broke after 2 months of siting on the deck.<br />The seller will not answer any question.<br />Don't buy from this seller or buy this product."
1.0,It's kind of cute but it looks like a toy...
1.0,Disappointed in color the make.
1.0,For a small head.
1.0,"It’s already coming apart. Just opened my package and the stitches are coming apart. Cheap fabric, it looks different than in the picture."
1.0,"I hated this shirt it was see threw, to small and cheaply made. i requested a refund and got no response"
1.0,So uncomfortable and the material is unflattering
1.0,"The item arrived and was already broken when it came. One buckle was barely hanging on, so needless to say, it fell off right away.<br />The quality and quality control should be better.<br />The product came damaged, appears to be of low quality, and is obviously lacking any type of qc."
1.0,this size is way too small and way too short looks she seems to have on an XL for it to fit like that.
1.0,"Very poor quality, just returned. Waste of your money, do not try"
1.0,Nice but at least two sizes to small. Can’t wear
1.0,"Bought two colors, the seam ripped on both the first try. Cheap. Size large."
1.0,"The color was a very dark and dull gray-green and not like the one pictured.They were crystals but they did not look to be the same caliber of other Swarovski 'Elements' stones I own. The production quality was also poor; the crystals were not in a true bezel setting, they were glued in and they were not centered (so the silver ring was not even all the way around). I'd received a different pair in a similar style (leverback bezel set cushion Swarovskis) from seller Xuping and was really surprised by the quality of the bezel and brilliance of the stone, so I took a leap on this pair and the quality between the two was drastic."
1.0,"This item said teenagers. It does not fit a teenager . Not wide enough , barely can get it  on my 11 year old granddaughter , she said it’s too tight. Very disappointed"
1.0,Too large for a medium. I ordered the green with stripes. It does not look like the picture. Very disappointed.
1.0,Product did not have LED lights as advertised.
1.0,I ordered 4 pairs of leggings from them and three of them ripped at the inner crotch area within one day of using and a couple had the seams at the bottom of the leg completely messed up. I reached out to them but haven’t heard back.
1.0,Too short too tight not at all what was expected
1.0,"This depress was anything but what it was described as. It looked like awful, did not fit and was cheaply made. It was skin tight and had no flow to it at all."
1.0,We went through THREE of these (yellow/blue) and every single one had such bad adhesive on the right side that lense pops off after brief use. 3 different pairs - right lense on each.
1.0,Was very cheap and didn’t fit. Not even close to sizing posted and tore when I put it on. I also sent it back and never received a refund. They “never” got it. I sent it back immediately.
1.0,Returned this Item they were cute but not what I  expected.
1.0,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS AND IT BROKE!!! It is sooooo delicate, not worth the 5 dollars!! Im returning. I didnt even get to wear them to my event. I should of listen to the reviews and saved myself money, time. Highly dissatisfied. HOW DO I RETURN??!?!?!"
1.0,"How can you sell a watch that fails to keep time?  In 42 years wearing a Casio watch,  this the only model to fail not once but twice !  Can you sell me a model that keeps accurate time ?"
1.0,"I can't wear them. They pinch my toes, rub on the back of the ankle have no support and leave black marks on the skin."
1.0,Awful. Leaks horribly all over. I have water dripping all over me and I can no longer use it.
1.0,This item took about a month to arrive & when it finally did I was quick to return it. Too much material & poor fit. Was not flattering at all. Loose & gapping in the front. Purchased in black. Came as a true black but material was different from photos (silky material). This is NOT an easy Amazon return. You will have to pay for return shipping which was $14 with USPS for me. Definitely not worth the hassle.
1.0,"Cheap, low quality, thumb holes way off"
1.0,Broke the first day. Very cheap
1.0,"I brought for my grand daughters. The first night one broke. Literally separated from sole. Then by week's end, the second pair broke; samething. I wrote their named so couldn't return. Never again"
1.0,Save your money. Super thin and small. Not worth it
1.0,"very small, more for a childs hands than a woman"
1.0,"Great concept, but poor quality.  Water seeps into your field of vision despite adjusting for fit or using a different nose bridge size attachment.  Since when did quality control or testing become optional.  Stick with a name brand at a local store.  I had to return these and I hate returning items as amazon can hold returns against you and close your account.  However, I cannot allow my money to go to waste due to poor workmanship.  I work hard for my money.  Please avoid this brand."
1.0,They are made for babies
1.0,HUGE and I got a small
1.0,too thick for me. Also size a bit off. its doesnt look exactly like the pics when u put it on
1.0,Too tight to get cards in and out of. I can't use it.
1.0,Plastic feeling not comfortable
1.0,"I got the white dress, and it's so thin, it's like having soft tissue paper over your body. I couldn't make it work even with a slip underneath. Maybe a different color would work better, but it was such cheap material that I'm just returning it."
1.0,"It is a midi length, definitely not short. Sleeves are HUGE. way too big in all the wrong places. Cheap. Would not recommend"
1.0,"I was very disapoitnbed with these so called night vision, did not do well at all for me."
1.0,"The XL was to tight/small, This brand iLove SIA did not fit me. It fit like a MED.<br />I ordered an XL to be safe just in case the pants would not fit properly.  I was wrong."
1.0,When by the chart they gave and still to small. When i trying to return it they said no that the chart was right and i was wrong
1.0,"Cheap, thin and not well made."
1.0,This product was suppose to come with a screen protector and it did NOT!
1.0,Weird fit....maybe for plus size women. I didn't like this product at all. Waisted 30 bucks
1.0,"The zipper was broken. It wouldn't unzip. The lace was tattered. I wouldn't recommend this item at all. In fact, the picture is so not like the dress."
1.0,Dislike it broke ripped just undoing the velcro so we couldn't give it as a gift and had to throw it away bad quality
1.0,"Very poor quality, leather &#34;coating&#34; began to peal off on fingers after first day,and will NOT stop  thorn from puncturing ...A very sore thumbs DOWN!!"
1.0,"I ordered a large... I'm 5'8"" and 137 lbs.  I followed the sizing guide.  When it arrived I felt like I was doing a remake of ""fat guy in a little coat"" from Tommy Boy.  These foreign manufacturers need to understand American sizing better."
1.0,Cute but broke in less then 2 days
1.0,Runs very small I ordered two sizes up . The length of it is so long you can cut it to make a shawl out of it. The cost to return it back it way too expensive I guess I lost my money.I will never order from this company again
1.0,This is probably second time i have receive either wrong size or the size mentioned on the label is wrong. It doesn't fit
1.0,What a horrible product. It costs almost as much as a shoe and broke in less than one week. Such a waste of money.
1.0,Did not keep its shape
1.0,Broken immediately upon placing earrings on.
1.0,Cheap feel. (It IS cheap) :) tangles EASILY
1.0,"didn't work, could never clip it on my watch. sitting in a drawer and never heard back from the company I bought it from."
1.0,"Dress is really cute but after wearing one time, the dress looks old, looks worn out. Wished i didn't bought this. Waste of money"
1.0,"I had no complaint with the value or quality just too big.  I don't like earrings that ""bang"" against the side of my face."
1.0,"Very pretty, but the chain and clasp broke the first day"
1.0,"Not genuine leather, cheap synthetic materials"
1.0,The fabric is cheap. It’s goofy looking. It’s a mess.
1.0,"Sorry folks, it’s a no for me.<br />Now, granted, the price makes these shirts inexpensive so I was taking a chance with it. Also, the sizing warns that they run small and to size up…but the size and fit was just weird. The stated size for XXL shows tit to be a size 12 in US sizes…I normally wear an 18 but I also normally wear an XL in shirts and they fit well. These shirts (I bought 3) were tight at the top, neck area (and I’m not busty) and tight at the bottom so it tugs around the waist/hip area. I couldn’t decide to say that the top fit big or small because it was different…weird. The sleeves were way too long, not even rolling them up a turn helps.<br />It took forever to arrive. I’m sure it shipped from China, which is ok, if you’re not in a hurry, I wasn’t.<br />Now, about the main reason I didn’t like it…the material was thick and silky. I expected a tee-shirt material, with a little stretch to it. But this was not stretchy enough to give at the top so putting it on was uncomfortable.<br />Basically, the workmanship quality was good and it will probably wash well. I just couldn’t find a reason to keep them, not even to just wear around the house."
1.0,"I wear large size gym shorts and ordered large. I made the mistake of reading the reviews after I purchased them so I ordered an XL just in case. Well, the larges won’t even go past my knees and the XL shorts fit like smalls. Not kidding my junk was so tight I couldn’t even post a picture. I made sure they didn’t send me the wrong sizes, but even the tags on the shorts were what I ordered."
1.0,"Guess it's not finding it's way to my house this year.  I hope someone got to wear and it looked good on you bc I never saw it.  Once upon a time, I thought it would be great for a Christmas Party ... typical ending for 2020."
1.0,Waited weeks for this to arrive and it doesn’t Even remotely resemble the picture.
1.0,"I bought these for running and they constantly ride up. I must tuck it in for it to stay in place and that’s pretty uncomfortable while running.  They are itchy and I wouldn’t recommend them,"
1.0,JUNK. I WAS TOTALLY EMBARRASSED BY THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT. The clasps fall off. I had to replace 7 customers necklaces.
1.0,Material and style..disappointed
1.0,"I ordered one and when it arrived I was very excited. I went to put it on and the strap was broken. I ordered a replacement and as I was wearing the replacement, the strap broke. Two times with the same style dress. I Do NOT recommend buying this dress unless you know how to sew."
1.0,"These are sticky to anything that isn’t skin. The moment I tried to stick the top part to my clean/dry skin, it immediately started peeling off."
1.0,This product violates the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. “Cotton Blend” is not a legal way to describe the fabric content of a garment sold in the US. Specific fabric names and percentages are required.
1.0,Not true to size material thin and not comfortable.
1.0,These are of very poor quality. I would never use these for my business.
1.0,Falls off easily. Is not securely in place
1.0,"These glasses look great, but they are too narrow for even a small adult female face. They will break at the joints. Each pair I ordered lasted exactly the same amount of time before breaking. Don't buy them unless you want to replace them every few months."
1.0,"I absolutely fell in love with this, but when I tried it on it was SUPER SMALL!! I wear an XL and the shirt fit like a SM or MD. Really disappointing."
1.0,Love the colors. But extremely uncomfortable. Toe style is long and points up to the sky... not bendy/flexible so uncomfortable to walk in.
1.0,Didnt like this it wasnt fitting. Looked more like a big shirt.
1.0,does not work its a scam
1.0,"Would give Zero stars if I could.  So incredibly disappointed.  Size is so small it’s a joke, absolutely no lift whatsoever, adhesive stuck for maybe a couple minutes. So disappointed 😔"
1.0,After several uses the catch does not hold
1.0,Great for bondage gear.
1.0,I only recieved the black one..I thought it came with 2
1.0,I should've known -- you get what you pay for.  This thing came apart when I tried to put it on.  It is now in the trash.
1.0,Not worth the money this is a toy watch.. kids don't play with this at all
1.0,"I liked that it was leopard, what I didn’t like is that I never got to wear it because the bracelet broke soon as I put it on and the necklace broke as well."
1.0,The drawstring I’m the hat was broken upon delivery. Really disappointed. Amazon was good about taking the item bacj
1.0,Good material.<br />Only one jersey comes in this order.
1.0,Very fragile and the lens fog up easily.
1.0,The strap never stayed fastened
1.0,Opened the package and noticed it broken:(
1.0,"I ordered the robes for the Spa guests and was greatly disappointed in its quality! Size ""onesize/large"" robes are huge and I didn't even need to order XXL robes in addition to these ones. After only one wash the material has become paper-thin and see-through.  I am glad I had only opened two of them and now I can return the rest. Honestly, I don;t know how many uses I can get out of this robe..."
1.0,Material is very thin and they are sized small.
1.0,"It's a giant bag. Very heavy material, very long, horrible lines, not flattering."
1.0,"The edge of the brush is the only part that is flexible, therefore, provides limited moblity. I thought the whole brush was soft rubber, the rest is hard plastic. I didn't like that!"
1.0,Terrible color that does not represent the thin gold line. This is more fluorescent yellow line.
1.0,Don’t like how it fits
1.0,"Way too big , disappointed"
1.0,These gloves absolutely reek of dead fish. Wash your hands with soap and it doesnt go away. Not the least bit warm either.
1.0,"Totally bizarre fit...I could not for the life of me figure out the top, & if you have a D chest forget it, there is absolutely no support.<br />Everything about this suit is wrong.<br />Looked nothing like the photos as I could not get it figured out."
1.0,Gave me an itchy feeling all over
1.0,"WOW! Poor quality! The button was sewn through the lapel & the threads were all pulled!  Unfortunately, I waited to long to have it tailored ( never opened it) and now can't return it ...even for credit. If I could get credit I'd own my mistake, but this is truly junk. Sad, because I've bought other suits and found them acceptable, but this was just such low quality."
1.0,I didn’t even take it out of the bag bc it came from China. Threw it away
1.0,Fits oddly in the crotch. Frumpy not sporty.
1.0,Didn't fit as expected.  Would't fit both fingers.  Very cute though.
1.0,Itchy and poor quality
1.0,There are some kind of corduroy styled pants that have the smallest imitation ridges to make them look like corduroy. They are some kind of synthetic material too. A cigarette ash landed on my pants and burned a hole in it revealing the lining material underneath. These pants should not be allowed to be sold as corduroy.
1.0,"This is only 21 pieces… title says 200, so very disappointed with this purchase. I assumed since it was a shipped from China item that’s getting 200 was a very reasonable expectation… sad to say there were only 21."
1.0,The clasp on this item broke before my son even wore it.
1.0,"Did'nt work for my husband! Fit very oddly....he didn't like it, so we returned it!"
1.0,XL was WAYYYY too small.
1.0,This necklace is junk.  The chain was too think and kinked up.
1.0,Could not get this jacket on.  Waited over a month to get it and it did not fit.
1.0,These earrings are so flimsy and are literally a piece of wire you can bend very easily. The “closure” is just a half circle that the earring end is supposed to go into but that obviously doesn’t hold it in place. It looks very odd in the ear as well it doesn’t stay right. Such a disappointment!!! But then again shouldn’t have expected much for the price...Going in the trash.
1.0,"The earrings are Nothing like the picture,  or description.  Dissatisfied."
1.0,these were a waste of money...i have no idea what glasses they would ever fit...i just went to my optometrist and he replaced them for free....
1.0,"It's looks cheap, not what I thought I was buying!!!"
1.0,These arrived with one of the stones loose in the package.
1.0,This dress was at least 2 sizes too small
1.0,"I order a man's large, it was way to small."
1.0,I bought these shorts and they were delivered yesterday. They were soaking wet and smelled like urine inside a bag. I’m not sure what happened and frankly don’t care but I’m not wearing them.
1.0,Came with clasp broken and when I had to return it I had to pay for it. $13.00 to go back to CHINA... ugh!  So not worth it!!!
1.0,This product is clearly inferior.  Not a relaxed fit at all.  Color is much darker than depicted in the photo and material is much heavier than what I was expecting.  Not the quality that I would expect from an Amazon order.
1.0,Glasses fell apart after wearing two times. Save your money.
1.0,very ugly fabric
1.0,"The item itself is fine, worthy of four stars. But the price is a serious ripoff! You can buy a set of 50 cards directly from the United States Chess Federation online store for about a quarter of this price."
1.0,"gave it to my son, not even close to fitting my wrist"
1.0,Shirt looks nothing like the picture. Runs really small in the arms. I do not recommend.
1.0,"Listen all my curvy women.  By curvy I mean size 16 or 18 hips.  This dress is not your friend.  We broke up immediately and the fabric is incredibly cheap and heavy.  If you are considering the pink color, do not unless you want to look like a pepto bismal bottle. This dress could work if you have a 16/18 booty and slim thighs and even then, go with an XL.  The material is so cheap.  It is like a costume.  It doesn't look anything like what you see on this picture.  Thick women, I am trying to help us out because a lot of the reviews don't tell us the truth.  This dress is no friend of ours."
1.0,"I ordered these as compression pants, as the description says they are.  I ordered the size from the size chart, and the pants were too large. When pulling on the pants, I could see the fabric stretch, and let the white fabric stretch show underneath the black fabric.  The pants were in fact too large, so there should have been no ""see through"".  I have had other name brand compression pants where the fabric is thick, stretchy yet stiff, hence the compression aspect of it.  These were just some other workout pants trying to be sold as compression.  Had I bought them with the mindset of cheap yoga pants, then they would have been ok."
1.0,This necklace is way to small. It is not way they say this neckclace is.
1.0,The bottom part was broke.<br />Can’t wear it
1.0,See title. Returned immediately.
1.0,"These shirts are not true to size. Go up two sizes. Also the fabric is that shiny fabric, not comfortable. Would not buy again."
1.0,Material was soft and they were broken immediately
1.0,This ring was so misshapen it was not round at all and looked ridiculous on. Don't buy this
1.0,Took out the package and was so cheap the color of the heal came off by touching it! They make it really hard to return! Buyer beware! These are cheap crap! Go to Walmart instead!
1.0,Too large by far! Cannot be adjusted.
1.0,"The arm keeps falling off. But, it’s easily snaps back on. It’s annoying to keep Putting it back on."
1.0,I love wall flowers but I have noticed the ones with the double buttons at the waist are cut just a little small at the waist and the remaining of the jean fit perfect.
1.0,Fit is fine but can barely see the ffdp logo.SERIOUSLY FAINT AND TINEY. Wouldn't buy again. And wouldn't recommend anyone waste their money
1.0,It is very soft but not white like said in the description. Kind of a let down.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ae21a6fe0d273060dbb11c845a7b235f]] Came with deodorant marks
1.0,These pantyhose have no elastic. They don’t stay up.
1.0,Metal paint chips. Yum..
1.0,A large is like a 29 waist! This is ridiculous! Way too small i needed them by 4th of july damn!
1.0,Couldn’t get it to work
1.0,Dislike! I have a very upset 8yr old CHIEFs fan on his birthday. We ordered a $50 Patrick Mahomes jersey size medium & got a crappy bears jersey size large. Jerks!
1.0,First time I went to put it on it broke. Very disappointed
1.0,Too long in the body to short in leg have to pull them almost to chest to fit. Overall feel of material doesn't feel good.
1.0,"The earrings are very pretty- BUT the title is misleading. These are not gold-plated and they are definitely not sterling silver. I'm allergic to some metals, but I am able to wear both sterling silver and gold comfortably. The moment I put these earrings on, my ears immediately start to itch, rendering them unwearable."
1.0,I have gotten a lot of this same brand and always have been impressed this was thin and flimsy made poorly
1.0,Hurt my nose and the Jeweled ones didn’t even fit. the backing that went inside of your nose was bent at a weird angle making it impossible to wear for more than 30 minute without causing pain.
1.0,Your  astrology chart is incorrect.
1.0,Why didn’t I see Austen was misspelled before I bought this as a gift???
1.0,No me agrado porque nunca llego a mi casa las 2 chaquetas
1.0,"Would not recommend this to anyone. Me and my buddy both ordered this. Both got damaged jacket mine had both pocket zipper damaged, his was missing zipper. We ordered for a hiking trails trip and had to go to the store to get one at the last minute."
1.0,This is the worst quality item I have ever received from Amazon. Too small. A wrinkled mess. Don't waste your money
1.0,"way too small!  there is no way a 5'6"" 195 pound woman can fit into these!!!!couldn't even put my leg in it. i gave them away!"
1.0,Case is ver loose. Does not fit Note 8 tightly.
1.0,Fits as expected when you first get the romper.  Shrinks after one wash.
1.0,"Bought this for my daughter and she loved it, however it has left a green ring around her finger. This is supposed to be sterling so I am not sure why it has but we are disappointed. I would not recommend it."
1.0,typically wear a 10/12 large - this shirt is super small across back and chest- sleeves are only part true to size- also very short does not even come to my hips - only 5'5&#34; tall
1.0,I loved the fit and style but unfortunately one of the side seams burst open on my way to work to attend a corporate meeting!!  The material is sooo frayed that it is beyond repair.  About 6 inches!!  Extremely disappointed.
1.0,This shirt is cheap and the white is see-through. I returned it.
1.0,I got a cheap and horrible knitted sweater instead what I ordered. I have no way of returning it.
1.0,I got it in a 36 but the band is exactly 30 inches long so it fits more like a 32. It isn't even remotely close to being big enough!
1.0,"wanted low profile, some how I got high. not happy! maybe my fault I don't know? bought three and two were high profile wanted all low profile!"
1.0,"no tiene nada que ver con la fotografía en la que se muestra, muy mala calidad sin forma una túnica  que no corresponde al precio que pague quiero devolver"
1.0,"I was initially impressed with the look of these as I pulled them out of the box. But to my dismay the first one I tried to put on ripped, not at a seam or a zipper, but in the fabric itself. I didn't even try to put on the left one.<br />For a simple rain cover, the design is good. They are designed to slip over the cycle shoe then close at the heel end via a zipper offering coverage over the entire shoe and up the ankle for a ways. The bottom has sufficient opening to keep any style clips free to engage pedals.  But the fabric, in my case the silver fabric in the rear by the zipper, is either too thin OR my sample had a defect. I ordered size XXL, and wear a size 10.5 shoe. The cover's fit was admitedly quite tight."
1.0,It was pretty cute on the first day I received it but on the second day it fell apart.
1.0,I could never get them undone. Waste of money
1.0,"Lenses are huge, i look like an insect."
1.0,I dislike it ..<br />It’s quality was awful
1.0,"Super cheap, junk plastic.  Plastic doesn't fit my frames, and even if it did, it wouldn't protect anything."
1.0,Not sewn on well. Broke after one day wear.
1.0,Earrings are cute but do not stay on. Magnets are not strong enough. Appear to be too small to connect through the thickness of an earlobe.
1.0,Can't get wrinkles out. Flimsy fabric.  Returned.
1.0,Ripped right when I took it apart from itself the strap came off in my hand before I even put it on was super excited for it to arrive very big disappointment
1.0,not very flattering at all. the fit is tight and super low cut. not the most comfortable.
1.0,Very cheaply made not worth of money it is a complete rip off.....
1.0,If I could give 0 stars I would. Cheap and NOT what is pictured. Spend a little bit more money and get a better piece of clothing than this. Don't buy this for your own good. I was very disappointed.
1.0,It ripped after 5 days of use.
1.0,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!! STAND CLEAR AND DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT ORDERING THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!
1.0,Product arrived broken and does not work.
1.0,Update:  I ordered this item TWICE and both times the top and bottom were sewed incorrectly.  The top was seen facing sideways.<br /><br />Beware they don’t perform quality checks. I received mine with top sewn facing sideways from bottom.
1.0,The chair was tangled and broken on the necklace.
1.0,Bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter.  So small barely shows up.
1.0,Top has padding on the inside making it fit and look awkward. Poorly made for high price. Even though I pay for prime I still got charged for shipping and then again to return.
1.0,The Medium fits like an extra large.  Wasted my money. Could not wear it.
1.0,"I do not understand all the good reviews of these pants.  They have a weird fit and feel like sandpaper.  I would return them, but you must pay international shipping to return them.  It is not worth it.  Save your money and steer clear of this seller and these horrible pants."
1.0,I purchased a 2t qnd what arrived would fit q 5 year old easily. Returned
1.0,"Talk about getting what you paid for.  It took only second to place them onto the Watch.  And equally the same amount of time to fall off of the Watch.  Although, if you were dressing a mannequin, that promised not to move, they may work fine.  But, have duct tape handy, just in case."
1.0,So cute but runs small and sheds like crazy
1.0,Disappointed. Discovered a this.
1.0,"Doesn't look like the picture at all. Far too small. Order 2 sizes too big. Completely sheer. Fabric is cheap, thin, rough. Should have expected quality for the price. Don't bother."
1.0,Very poor quality very thin cheap material wish i could leave 0 stars 👎
1.0,Did not fit.  Go get OEM parts.
1.0,Ordered for a friend who said that they turned color and feel cheap.
1.0,Very disappointed! The Roman numerals on the watch are incorrect. There's a 4 where a 6 should be. Buyer beware!
1.0,"Cheap, turn my ears black."
1.0,Wrong
1.0,I purchased two different sizes and they run small and hurt me not comfortable and I want buy this again
1.0,This dress is a joke. You get what you pay for on this one. HUGE and so unflattering. I almost didn't even try it on because it looked ridiculous right out of the bag. Don't waste your time.
1.0,Pretty earrings but trying to close them is extremely hard and not made very well almost on unwearable and  Design on only one side of earrings
1.0,[[VIDEOID:b164da627ed74c480ca0a8879a3e47f2]] Came I a plastic envelope and arrived all busted up
1.0,Too small and I ordered big.
1.0,"It's big.  The stitching is crap.  More importantly, it doesn't look like the picture.  No Bucky on the back, its &#34;WISCONSIN&#34; text.  I think this Prime free returns policy also saves these vendors from false advertising, which is illegal."
1.0,"Is this product a joke?  The plastic ""shield"" is soft and looks like it was repurposed from bags used to sleeve blankets, has a nasty chemical smell, is hard to see through and is a bit short, barely touches my chin.  You have to tie it around the floppy hat brim.  Do not waste your money."
1.0,Awful quality doesn’t look like picture at all
1.0,This scarf is disappointingly short and looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,I’m 5’3 120lbs I got an xs and these things are huge!! Three sizes bigger you mean.. it’s more like a large. No thank you.
1.0,Terrible they all broke the day I got them don’t recommend!
1.0,Good price. But oh my god. They put the handles inside the bag. 🤦🏼‍♂️  That was a little stupid.  But anyway works good for the price 4 bucks
1.0,"These socks aren't what I expected to be ""cotton"" socks. They're more of a ""polyester"" type feel rather than a ""cotton"" feel. Not for me, not what I wanted..."
1.0,Looks nothing like pictured. The size was so small it seems like it would be meant for a toddler.
1.0,"I went up a size as suggested, which fit me perfectly. The shorts were so comfortable, and the length was perfect. I returned it because you can see right thru the fabric. I ordered this in green, you can see everything."
1.0,"feels like a cheap watch you can grab from walmart... mostly a plastic feel about it, smaller then it looks and I have no clue how this can be a ""military grade"" watch... waste of money and returned promptly"
1.0,This bag did not hold up to a little bit of rain. The finish became blemished. I have contacted the manufacturer but they have not responded.
1.0,"The ring is nice, but stretched out significantly in just two weeks time. Now it just slides off with little effort. I can’t figure out how to message the seller for a replacement without doing a whole return process."
1.0,My daughter was so excited! She loved her new onsie. I washed it and the ears both fell off. She hasn’t even worn it. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,It was way too big the pants are extra long
1.0,Not happy with this at all. Looks cheap and the zipper broke in the first month. The only good thing I can say is it was very roomy.
1.0,It came with a hole in the pocket! So disappointed
1.0,"After washing multiple times, these still leave a black on my toilet seat while wearing.  Honestly you should have to refund me."
1.0,The color was not correct and did not look like the picture
1.0,To dam small...
1.0,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.  This is my second of these bracelets. First, let me say they look great. Also, I usually love Novica stuff, and have found the quality of their artisans to be very good. Alas, this isn't the case here. My first bracelet broke where the ball enters the loop to hold it together.  The second one has lasted less then 6 months. The string wrap holding it all together just came apart (pic included). I was not hard on it, and I even took it off before showers. I will not be spending over $35 again for a bracelet that can't stay together."
1.0,I don’t like it because the sleeve it’s not sopported good in your arm
1.0,Doesn't look nothing like the picture the material is totally different and very cheap... Has not form is horrible!!!
1.0,Cheap and not big enough for an adult. Arrived creased. Returned.
1.0,The arms are too big too short just an odd fit all around
1.0,Bad quality. Starting falling apart in two weeks of normal use. I would not recommend this product.
1.0,"I was expecting a hoodie, this is more of a long sleeve shirt.<br />I was sorta of disappointed and probably won’t wear it much at all"
1.0,Cheap build did not use
1.0,"Really cheaply made.  Not sturdy, they bend as you handle them.  Clasp broke on one after one wearing."
1.0,Extremely thin. Does not look like the picture
1.0,"Super thin, almost see through. Runs 3 to 4 sizes to small. I would not purchase again"
1.0,disarm
1.0,I ordered a 3x too small
1.0,Bifocals were in the way of viewing
1.0,Came broken very disapointed
1.0,"So the idea of this is great, however it fails on multiple levels. It is at least a size to large in that the underlying layer is loose so it doesn't fit like yoga shorts with a float overlayer, you can see undies in certain poses. The pocket in the underlayer is too loose to securely hold anything (useless). The outer layer slit is large so it reveals the entire underlying layer like a skirt would. The waist band is tight so you can't size down to make the fit better, and from the back it isn't flattering even on a great figure! Would be better to purchase a tennis skort or yoga shorts if you need a useful pocket."
1.0,"The backs don’t hook/latch. Almost lost one. No, not happy with cheep products"
1.0,So misleading! Not even close to the picture! I sent it back right away!
1.0,This product band broke within the first week of having it. I received a replacement and the replacement band broke within to week. Very unhappy with the quality.
1.0,The flimsy frames broke within 30 seconds of arriving.
1.0,HORRIBLE FIT - SIDE OF BOOB SHOWS - DEFECTIVE
1.0,Beautiful color.  Wish it fit better
1.0,"Blue paisley. It’s hysterical, but the pockets on the shorts were both sewn in upside down! 😂 Can’t really move comfortably with your phone and keys falling out! 😆 Such a cute skort though!"
1.0,This earring is advertised as an ear cuff but does not have a single clasp to hold onto the ear.  When I put it on it just toppled over as though it was a chandelier earring.  I then tried to wrap the tail around the top curvature of my ear and the tail broke off.  I was not handling it roughly (because I would or could hurt my ear) but somehow the metal managed to break.
1.0,The red bleeds!
1.0,Color is dark it’s like a wine color so if you’re looking for a red shirt don’t buy this one.. definitely not recommend it
1.0,Product is not as described and is very cheaply made.  I got the 3xl so I could wear it to work.  What I received had no size on the tag and fit as if it was a medium.  Requested a refund but I would have to pay to send back to the company which would cost almost as much as I paid.  The company has a note when you go to get the label that say they will refund 20 percent which truly is an insult when the sizing a description of the product is way off.  Just want the Buyer to Beware as I was not please with this experience.
1.0,Love the price for the brand.
1.0,Fabric not as pictured. Cheap looking. Returned it.
1.0,Poor quality looks nothing like the picture
1.0,This us not a Van Halen logo I received the same kind of mask as the previous review. The logo is a W. A.
1.0,Not real Stirling silver er already tarnished after One month exactly can not.retum so unhappy
1.0,"These are so ugly! I'm a huge sunglass fan, I have many. These hurt to wear, and I couldn't see anyone who would wear them, except for a joke"
1.0,My issue was that this dress is super thin and I like floor length dresses which are hard to find for me and it stopped at my ankles. I bought the off white/beige one and ended up returning it
1.0,I am not sure what they dye these with but they had a horrendous odor - I had to return them because my hands smelled for the entire day after wearing them in the morning.
1.0,It lasted me about 4 uses and it started to break at the stitches.
1.0,"Even with ordering the smallest size it was biiiiig! The length was good, as it was short and fell about mid thigh. Unfortunately it looked like a potato sack on my body and I was hoping it'd be form fitting like it's shown to be in the picture<br /> I'm 5'2 and wear xs/0 if this helps anyone considering buying it."
1.0,The sleeves are not as pictured. They are very short. I will be returning it.
1.0,The color is much darker and the material just looks cheap.
1.0,"Beautiful color but too loose on the top, no support so any movement causes the girls to slip out"
1.0,Cheap junk.  Far too thin
1.0,"They do not spray well at all! I am very disappointed! I bought them for vinegar sprays, homemade air freshener, etc."
1.0,Cheaply made. You get what ypu pay for!
1.0,The boxes where full of mold . It was terrible. They smelled so bad. I had to throw away the boxes . And the writing is so light  you can hardly read what it says .  Very disappointed.
1.0,These pj's were Huge!  I ordered the small & they were more like a large.  I'm 5'3 & weigh 117.  The feet were so long it's  foolish.  They're going back.
1.0,"This outfit is more of a halloween costume due to the combination of excessive tulle and incredibly cheap material.  Upon receiving my order it was coming apart in the seams and when i requested a refund the company emails me asking for proof! My proof is my dissatifaction and their unwillingness to accept a return withoutout me completing steps to make their job easier.  Overall this product is useless, ugly and a waste of money. Customer service also sucks."
1.0,It was a dress on my kiddo. I even ordered what was said to be the proper size. It I'd also very loose.
1.0,"Gave it to my medium sized daughter and it was too little for her, too. Not worth it."
1.0,Hated it ordered x-large and it looked and fitted like a small never wore it do not order
1.0,Runs big. I usually take sm to med. Says runs 2x smaller so got a large. To big for me..
1.0,The diaper bag strap has already broke on it and I just purchased it February 11<br />I didn’t get to start using it until Valentine’s Day after I had my son
1.0,Too bulky and cant screw back on because it's too short for tragus.
1.0,Very disappointed. I was so excited to see my baby in this but when it came it looked so discoloured and old. It looks like something she has owned for years. We have a pool party to go to and I won't be letting her wear it.
1.0,"This jacket looks incredible cheap. It runs small. So if you do purchase make sure to order up a size. FYI, the trim of the jacket is navy blue and the buttons are black. Why? It's also very shiny. Definitely sending back. Total bust."
1.0,"I am 5'-7"" and weigh about 200lbs.  Based on the chart in the advertisement I purchased the large (L).  The fit is in no way able to be ""untucked"".  It fits very snug around the chest, neck, and arms, maybe a little too tight at the neck for me.  The material is good quality out of the box but it just does not fit.  I wouldn't complain if the add did not state ""fits for every shape and size"".  Cleary it does not.  Looking at the sizing guide there is only 1-1/2"" variance in length between S and L so there is just no way I could fit in a small to get the length I need to wear it untucked.  This product may work for someone tall and thin but if you have a thick build I'd go elsewhere.  Think wide receivers not running backs :(  I guess I will just continue to pay for the actual ""Untuckit"" brand.  They do have shirts for thicker builds that can be worn untucked."
1.0,Missing backs & ear rings
1.0,Don't waste your money<br />This is not all leather and shortly after I got it the outside started flaking off<br />My wife said it looks worse than the belt I was replacing that I had worn over 5 years and told me to switch back.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE
1.0,"Photo is completely deceitful. It's a scraggly little thing that smells strange. It looks like the mannequin in the photo has 2 or 3 of these on, not one. And I waited over a month to get it."
1.0,It looked nothing like the pic. The black is not there and the tank top is not the same as shown.
1.0,Not very great material ..cute belt but I won’t perchase again.
1.0,"Made very cheap. Both bridge nose pads fell off and lost one, Making the sun glasses useless."
1.0,not nearly a good as advertisd
1.0,"The top was okay , but seriously just ok ,still loose for a medium and not flattering on your curves ...but the bottom part of this set is awwwful I ordered a medium which is what I wear and it fits awful ! The material is like my grandma's dress pants !!  Its got an elastic waist band..weirdest fit ! What a disappointment, so mad. I hate bothering with returns !"
1.0,The ink in this bled all over my pillow cases and stained them.
1.0,"The fit was not as I expected, super short but good on my waist.<br />The pink one is completely see through, I can't wear it!! Will return them for sure."
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL and also way to long.
1.0,Bought for my fiance and as she put it on it was tight till it reached her chest. It was far too tight. Wouldn't recommend for larger chested women
1.0,quality is bad. applying for return goods didn‘t feedback. Very disappointed for this.
1.0,"Don’t like anything about it, from fabric to fit.  Is square, not long as shown."
1.0,The material is horrible.  Feels very cheap and uncomfortable.  It is true to size.
1.0,"Not at all what I expected, looking for a summery cotton blouse but instead got a polyester blouse more suited to the workplace. Also smaller than expected."
1.0,Nonfue como esperabani me gusto
1.0,I purchased these for my husband as a nice pair of flip flops.  He only wore them a few times and they broke.  Don't waste your money!
1.0,Product breaks to easy
1.0,Not what I expected.  I returned them the same day I received them.
1.0,Spend the extra money for a better one. Wasn't worth buying.
1.0,I didn't get them I got a dietary supplement for migraine headaches instead<br /> And now I won't get them in time for Christmas but instead 3 days after that how awesome is that.
1.0,"I'm wondering if I got the right bras. As soon as I opened the package I was skeptical that the fabric would stand up to high impact. The fit was weird. It barely covered my chest (36D/DD) but was loose. I didn't even try to run, just jostled a bit, and there was soooo much bouncing happening. I'm sending them back."
1.0,"Terrible! Plastic straps broke just like everyone elses, extremely hard to adjust also. Mask is too heavy to be supported by the straps. My 6 year old was very disappointed.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"This dress was like wearing a cloud,a fluffy cloud.It was too puffy for me the color was soft and pretty but it wasn't for me."
1.0,One cuff link works perfectly and one does not work at all. I was successful in getting the broken link to hold some motion after violently shaking and spinning it.<br /><br />There is no option to speak to a Custer service rep to replace the one broken cuff link but will update to five stars if I can replace
1.0,This ring is incredibly heavy. I bought it for me (a woman - size 6) and it weighs more than my husband's 8mm size 13.5 ring.<br />So bummed. Returning.
1.0,Did not like the way it fit. Does not have any support in the upper body.
1.0,No good. Size is way off.
1.0,"This dress fit odd, it seemed backwards. I wore it for about 2 hours for family pictures, and it shred green pills/balls all over. Not pleased and would not purchase again."
1.0,It was so small wouldnt have fit my 5 year old niece.<br />Returned it!
1.0,I had a pair of Wamsutta slippers like these for 2 years.  Loved them and they wore very well.  I purchased these in December and already have lost the elastic (ankle area) and now they won't stay on my feet.  Also the dots on bottom are all falling off.  Not sure what happened to these slippers to make them so cheap now.  So disappointed!!
1.0,Boots came apart after second wear.
1.0,Did not look like the pictures. Much bigger in person. Not dainty at all.
1.0,The shoulder straps ripped in the middle of trick or treating and exposed my daughter
1.0,"Not happy with this shirt at all.  It's for my son and the material is a weird shiny material.  It's also very long for a small.  He said he will wear it around the house because of the material and length, but not out in public.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Cute but runs incredibly small.
1.0,Had on my car for less than 20 minutes. Got on the highway and one antler broke off .. gone forever. What a waste of money.
1.0,Will tarnish and turn green
1.0,This slip has 0 padding. There isn't even a pocket inside so you can put some bra padding in! It's just totally useless. DON'T BUY.
1.0,"Short and tiny. Not mean for an adult. Didn't even cover my calf,  let alone go foot tho thigh"
1.0,Super cheap tarnished after 3 days but it was $7🤷🏽‍♀️
1.0,"Owned and loved the 3's for YEARS. Reviews said this model was closest iteration to the classic 3's so I tried 'em out.<br /><br />AWFUL. I am a standard 13 across the board in just about everything. They changed this drastically. I had to open the laces so wide they couldn't be tied. My toes hit the end. FITS LIKE A 12 and is NARROW.<br /><br />They also changed the footbed cushioning. It's garbage and digs into your arch--like they made this for people with extremely high arches. I am a normal arch. These ARE NOT HIGH HEELS Brooks.<br /><br />Seriously Brooks, what gives? Just re-release your model 3 and. Call it the &#34;3s SPECIAL edition&#34; or something and stop ruining what was once a great product!"
1.0,"I paid. $100.00 more for these shoes, because thought they were all  leather. Footlocker shoes were identical... I learned the hard way.. I'm 75 ..shame on me for not making my grandchild give me back his gift after I found they were missed advertising."
1.0,"God knows I much excited I was when it arrived ,but too bad did not fit me at all hope they will be true to size I wear XL normally and it fit me like a small.too bad I loved the color and way it was"
1.0,Es un robo pedí uno a mi gusto y me mandaron uno q no era no lo recomiendo
1.0,These shoes have fallen apart with normal indoor use and I’ve only had them a month and a half. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone.
1.0,Shoe ties broke immediately.  Very cheaply made.  Shoe itself is...ok but you can't screw up a plastic mass production mold.
1.0,Literally looks & feels NOTHING like the photos on this item. Super thick material & definitely fire engine red & NOT a wine red!
1.0,Looks are really deceiving. Uncomfortable feels like you're walking on the floor. One slipper broke in approximately 5 days of wear. So disappointed. I would've been better off with a $3 slipper from a 99cent store.
1.0,"I ordered an xl because I wanted it big. When I got it, it appeared to be a kids dress. I literally gave it to my niece who wears a 14/16."
1.0,"They look lovely, and are just the right length, but very poorly made. One broke just as I was putting it in my ear for the first time. Very disappointing."
1.0,"The stone was not the size described. The &#34;gold&#34; on the sides looked very cheap and appeared to be wearing off in spots already. The piece overall looked fake, cheap and poorly made. I was extremely disappointed with the quality."
1.0,"I'm a 2x, order a 2x, and couldn't get it kat my shoulders."
1.0,So comfortable and breathable. The only thing i didnt like is after wearing one time the seam by the should came undone.
1.0,Material is see through. I ordered and XL and it was basically a small
1.0,The decal on the hat was a flat grayish white that looked like it bled into the eagle. The customer service was good and they offered a refund but I wanted the hat as pictured.
1.0,When I ordered this item it said it was a 3-pack and I only received 1 mask. I didn't have the time to ship it back because we got covid so I missed my ship back deadline. :(
1.0,These are extremely stiff plastic. The toe stem is thick and very painful. Too painful to wear. Had to return
1.0,"Bought a small size, but it was way too loose. Did not like the material either."
1.0,"I first purchased these is an xl in the green. They were a little bit low but I want them for home. There is a crazy trying to make everything extra extra high waisted. And just because you are an XL doesn’t mean you need all that extra space. This causes me to have to fold down more than half of my lounge wear and pjs. I’m super sick of it. These Ralph Lauren polo without pockets are the only ones that it properly. But who wouldn’t love some pockets so I tried the junior sizing and to my surprise the green with pockets is super soft, comfy and washed as well. I ordered a second pair, and aqua. This one fits completely differently it comes up a little bit higher and is perfect. However, the material is not a soft and it is pilling on the seams. But the fit is perfect so they will do for at hardware anyway. They do not carry XL in many colors. One I was going to get sold out and has not come back. Black popped up as being available. I ordered it. They are The right fit at the waist line however the material is stiff and scratchy and wearing them one day ripped completely through the crotch. Thankfully I was at home sitting on the couch. You go to move your leg and you hear a rip WTH! I certainly don’t need every single pair of joggers I have to say polo on them. These were simply for the right waist height and comfort but some consistency would be nice. I wish They weren’t made in China but I was getting desperate. So just now if you try them they might be perfect. Every color is different material and fit. And Best of all you can send them back!"
1.0,"This mask has a giant size, it can fit two heads, very bad material and totally different from what they offer in a nutshell this is rubbish.  I do not recommend it to the garbage can."
1.0,Not true plus size.
1.0,Material too cheap. And also I am desagree with the way to return the product because I lost my shipping and also I have to pay for returned it.
1.0,"The chain was far too short and felt like plastic. The lettering was burnt in spots and some letters were not even painted black. The inner most spinner kept falling off when spun and the hourglass was just hot glued in place. Overall this was not what I was expecting or hoping for. I would not recommend buying this product, find a better reviewed product."
1.0,"I bought this dress in lavender/white for my daughter and myself. My daughter’s is okay and somewhat close to the picture. My adult small, however, looks NOTHING like the picture and the floral on it is terribly ugly. Like another review stated, the top of the dress is see-through. Sending back— totally bummed I won’t have a mother-daughter matching outfit for Easter."
1.0,"It looked like it had been worn, leather rope was peeling and it broke within the first hour of wearing"
1.0,"The design was cute,  but the fabric was cheap."
1.0,"The stone not only was incredibly difficult to get on, but then it fell off after 1 day, no where to be seen."
1.0,"Product works great, 1 star because half it leaked out of the bottle during shipping."
1.0,Dysfunctional watch winder. Broke soon after the 30-day return window so I was only able to get a half-refund. I'd highly recommend not buying any products from this brand. Go with a more reputable brand.
1.0,Wrong product arrived.. laced dress
1.0,Drawstring came to the middle of my chest.  Barely covered my butt.  Looked cheap.
1.0,It fits well but it looks fake the stitching is messed up you can see the glue under the rubber.. My boyfriend loved them and didn't notice them but if they were for me I would have returned them
1.0,Dont buy..Couldn't even wear no hook or latch
1.0,"The female end of magnetic snap that holds the flap closed, pulled out 0f the material with the male part of the snap. this happened on the first attempt to get into the bag. It is only secured by two tabs similar to a mailing envelop. The bag also makes your back sweet. The canvas stains easily which cannot be removed."
1.0,The chain broke as I was putting it on for the first time. Wouldn’t recommend. Very cheap material ☹️
1.0,Bigger than I wanted and looks cheap.
1.0,"Doesn't look like the picture at all,  shiny material and cheap looking. It's ugly"
1.0,Not a great product. The first one I put in broke in my sleep after only two days.
1.0,Not great! Not as warm as described.
1.0,"The material is too thick and wrinkled, and it is not flowy at all. It would be too warm in the summer and is not a flattering fit."
1.0,Cheap quality and to big would not let the joycon stick move all the way to either side very disappointed
1.0,I got this for my niece for Christmas.  She had I for a few hours and the jewel fell out already.  Kinda crazy for as much as was spend on this necklace.  I’d love to be able to get a new one.
1.0,I ordered a 7 typically I can wear a 6 1/2 to a 7 but the 7 was way to small
1.0,"I should have believed the reviews on this red pair of tarten plaid pants. They're very much like pajamas and are tight on my thighs. They also don't taper at the end of the leg like it shows. If you want to look like the girl in the photo, find a better high quality brand of pants."
1.0,Not at all what I expected.  Not at all comfortable.
1.0,The clasp on this doesn’t hold and just flips open all the time. Returning it for a refund. You get what you pay for I suppose.
1.0,"This was straight up crap,  They lied about the length.  I want my money back."
1.0,All of these I ever owned eventually in a few months go dead .. then if you leave em in the sun they come back on again but never really work right again..They keep going dead. It's like the battery stops being able to charge I guess
1.0,Doesn't look like the picture! Cheap this material!!!!
1.0,No stretch in socks at all. Run small. Not comfortable at all.
1.0,Stetsons isn't the quality it used to be. Every Stetson I bought had to change the cheap hat band. I don't know why Stetson uses glue to secure the band. It almost ruened my Charley Horse 1 made by Stetson which was not surpose to be a cheap hat. The stitching also came undone on the hat and I had to bring it to a leather shop to get restiched. I also had to repair the hat around where the hat band was because of the glue the factory used. All and all I wouldn't of had to do all the repairs if the hat band didn't come off the hat. I just wore the hat once and the band shouldn't have unglued from the hat.
1.0,I LOVED THE BRACELET.  IT BROKE WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF RECEIVING IT. NYLON THREAD TOO WEAK AND FLIMSY
1.0,Unbleable that a 4X was too small. Normal size is L to XL
1.0,2 different color materials
1.0,"I purchased these bras on size XXL. They run very small. They fit ok, however the straps do not stay on. They keep falling off, which is a pain. The material is nice."
1.0,item had to be miss marked for size jacket was very under sized.
1.0,WARNING THEY ARE NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE! They look like Kiss boots or something
1.0,Was sent pale pink. Not close to color as depicted.
1.0,"First, the product took over 3 months to arrive. Second, I ordered a medium following the size chart, but the item I received fit like an XXS (see picture comparing a regular Medium to these leggings). Additionally, all the tags had clearly been cut off the item (see pic). I don't know if that means someone else used them and returned them after wearing it (gross!) or the seller cut the tags off so I couldn't see the real size. The leggings are also uneven, you can tell from the pic that they won't lay flat or line up."
1.0,Not original
1.0,"If you want it for the airplanes- forget it- you cannot even distinguish the pattern, too dark"
1.0,"These don’t slip, but the elastic is exposed and so tight that I’m ready to cut my toes off with a dull knife by the end of the day!"
1.0,"If you're plus size, PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON PRODUCT. Don't believe other reviews that it's pretty. It's not all true. It's a very cheaply made product whose sizes are not just a ""little"" off. Its WAY OFF. ALMOST 5 SIZES SMALLER."
1.0,Sent it back.  Really really ugly and huge.
1.0,So so cheap
1.0,"It was okay, but all the flowers fell off and I had to get a hot glue gun to repair it."
1.0,Very cheap looking.  It would be more appropriate for a child maybe.
1.0,"The product photo is a shiny silver but what I received was dull metal that had already turned. I reported the issue and got a replacement. The replacement wasn’t any better and the replacement was not shiny either. Also, after wearing the necklace spacer one time, one of the clasps broke off of the clasp. Not a surprise because the quality does not seem good. Not worth the price in my mind. Very disappointed. Item received is not as pictured"
1.0,"I wore this beautiful dress for my husband's birthday yesterday April 10, 2021. It fit perfect and very comfortable(stretchy). It was fine during the lunch, but when I got up to get a drink, the zipper broke. Very embarrassing moment. I wonder if it can be returned."
1.0,"Screw loose on hinges, poor quality. I returned them."
1.0,My belt has a tear on it
1.0,"The Chain will fit a Child,<br />The football is the same size as my husband's thumb"
1.0,I recently bought this bracelet as a mother daughter gift and the first one i  got  the magnets would not come apart it looked like it was not cut then gat it replaced and the magnet came off of the new one... no reorder for me.
1.0,Beautiful watch. Worked great at first. My husband stated it is not holding time like it was in the beginning.
1.0,"I love the cut of these pants and bought the black and olive colors. After washing them once, inside out and on delicate, both pairs ripped at the pocket seams. I literally wore them once. Save your money."
1.0,When you ordered this product to make sure that you order exercise because it’s not the size that they sent you I ordered an extra large and it’s too small
1.0,The bottom fits perfect but the top fits small.
1.0,"The handles are too short.<br />While wearing optical glasses underneath protective glasses, the protective glasses may become loose and move away from the face, potentially allowing harmful light to enter the eye."
1.0,"I ordered a Large and it fit like a xsmall. I really like the material but it only goes a little past my elbows, I can hardly get my head through the head hole and the length of it stops at my bellybutton. There is no size tag or recommendation on how to wash."
1.0,I ordered up and they were way too small.
1.0,The material is coarse and uncomfortable.
1.0,color was more pink returned
1.0,Cheaply made and come apart. I've only wore these about 3 times.
1.0,Product received is not as shown in the picture. The necklace has a cheesy little red plastic stone instead of the cameo as shown.
1.0,Not what i expected. Fit price i guess.
1.0,Garbage. Looks nothing like the picture. Color and fabric is horrible.
1.0,Marcaron que dejaron mi pedido en la puerta y no encontre mi paquete ?  Lo dejaron en algun lugar equibocado
1.0,"The capris that I received were not actually a light pink color, as they appear in the photo.  They are more of a corral peach color (which I already have two pairs of in my wardrobe).  Was wanting something in actual 'pink'."
1.0,Sizing is ridiculous! WAYYYYY to small for what I ordered and feels like a nightgown. Not at all what was expected.
1.0,"Ordered a set of bows from this company, and two days later the picture changed, priced dropped and I ended up with a completely different set of votes then what I originally ordered. Shipping took almost a month and the product it self is very cheaply made. You can see hot glue on most of the bows where it did be hidden and the jewels keep falling off. I would not waste your time."
1.0,"Terrible. Edges are not finished and are crooked and dirty. I know it was inexpensive,  but it's not wearable."
1.0,"Bought this for my son. Metal around the face came off (??!) but there's nobody to call, no website, no contact info to get the watch fixed."
1.0,"The gloves always pretty my hands get wet. Also they are coming apart at the seams already, very poor quality."
1.0,"Cheap, wasn't worth it to me."
1.0,Sizes are completely misleading. You have to buy a size up. Will definitely be returning.
1.0,Not the correct size.
1.0,"Ha Ha Ha Ha !!!!!! This has to be a joke. But there is a sucker born every minute,"
1.0,This looks nothing like the photo with the model wearing it and it took 2 months to come
1.0,Pretty but very poorly/cheaply made
1.0,Fabric quality is not what I expected. It’s a slippery semi shiny fabric. Not what I expected. When you stretch it the pattern kind of disappears because it’s not screened well. Runs very small. Not a keeper.  Going back for sure.
1.0,Do not buy this dress. It was made a cheaply as possible. The material quality is poor. The designs are all cheap plasticy iron on appliques. Not worth the money at all.
1.0,"I'm so disappointed! I ordered two of these and they looked awful! The seam in the middle hits under my bust, not at the waist so the rest of the dress just looked lumpy and awful. I returned immediately. It does not look at all like the picture."
1.0,Is a beautiful piece but the quality is horrible half the chain is black.  Very disappointed
1.0,"It was so not squishy! non were squishy all dense, the only good one was the panda bun. but its not slow rising anyway. the paint starting peeling i can't believe i wasted money on this"
1.0,These are not genuine leather like it states.
1.0,Bought for my wedding reception. I read the size description and ordered the correct size and it fit BUT it is completely see through and the materials reminded me of my 4 year olds dress up dresses. Sending it back immediately
1.0,Not for the busty
1.0,The color was not expected
1.0,Product looks NOTHING LIKE PIX<br />& RUNS SMALL
1.0,Wayyyyyyyy too small. Cheap feeling.
1.0,"I never recommend because on display it shows embroidery but when I got it ,its just printed,very cheap stuff"
1.0,"Was not a slouchy beanie at all, was to short, like a regular skull cap. Very disappointed."
1.0,"order a 6-12m, it fit like a 3-6. i could barely get it snapped on my 6 month old."
1.0,"This dress makes you feel glamorous and beautiful.  I like the feel of the material and the flare it adds to your look.  This is my second one and each time I wear either of them, I get so many compliments."
1.0,The shirt is definitely not a women’s 2XL. It fits more like a small medium.
1.0,Wrong color shrunk 2 times to small out of dryer no fly strings hanging out of tops and bottoms. VERY bad pajamas. No short sleeve top as described. Sent long sleeves instead. Do not buy.
1.0,"The sandals I received were NOT the same color as in the picture.  The sandals I received were tan not brown.  Now they don’t have my size listed as an option.....  very disappointing!  Otherwise, the old pair I am replacing are awesome!"
1.0,Color off size too small
1.0,I bought many of the same dresses in different colors beCuse they fit very well..but his time this dress was sent to me with a stain! I did not unpack it right away because I knew the fit. Bit this time it came used!!!!! I disappointed! Can't return it one. Is too late.
1.0,I bought these gloves about 2 and 1/2 months ago for a job. Within the first month the rubber started the separate from the fabric on the fingers and rip off. If you do a lot of work all day long and these are not good gloves for you.
1.0,Elastic in the skirt and top was flimsy and the material was coming apart. Cheaply made
1.0,I’m 5’5 & wear a S normally & this dress is not wearable.  I ordered a M.  You can see my booty crack.
1.0,Completely wrong item!
1.0,I expected larger hoops. I didn't really read the description but they are SOOO small.
1.0,This ring is too large and chunky for size 8.  Uncomfortable
1.0,"The material is cheap, and rough what not what I was expecting."
1.0,One of the tank tops came with a small hole when I received them. They seem to be good quality other than that...I still will be returning because of the poor condition.
1.0,The style & fit were good but the fabric was too heavy & just strange feeling!
1.0,"Color was different than pictured, more like a diarrhea green, and decal was so thick it kinda raised off the shirt. Wasn't what I was looking for.  Retured it"
1.0,Did not fit my Gear S3
1.0,My foot kept sliding off to the side.
1.0,"Loved the color. Did not fit, different brand..don't like"
1.0,"This product just arrived today and I found that the rubber ends were much too narrow to fit over the ends of the frames of my sunglasses. In the past I bought a different brand and the ends fit perfectly. I don't know how this can be advertised as working with sunglasses as I think the frames of most sunglasses today are wide, not thin and narrow. Unfortunately it is too late for me to exchange them as I am leaving on a cruise this weekend."
1.0,"The tank top itself fit fine, it's the placement of the shamrocks that's problematic. I'm 5'1 and a size 34 D. The shamrocks were basically located on my stomach. I was able to pull the back of the tank top down to get them in the right spot, but it kept slipping after some time. Not worth it, I'm returning it."
1.0,It’s to small it’s uncomfortable as well
1.0,"BOTH PAIRS of earrings arrived broken, and when I took them out of the package to see if I could possibly fix them, pieces of wood from the earring just kept snapping off."
1.0,"The poorest quality, its been a week and are completely damaged"
1.0,Bad finishing
1.0,"I ordered this for a halloween costume and couldn’t wait to get it. Came in the mail early but was super disappointed to find it was wayyyyyyy too small. I’m usually and XL when it comes to amazon orders (5’4, 170 pounds) but when I pulled it out of the package I couldn’t even begin to get it to fit around me. Really disheartened and I’m going to try sending it back. Not sure if I’ll be buying another size or not, but if I do I will end up trying a 4X bcuz I cannot stress how small this thing was."
1.0,You get what you pay for. These lens were  cheap and easily scratched.
1.0,Don't buy this. It's made very cheaply and the material is so thin.
1.0,"I don't who these masks are sized for with their ""various sizes"", but none of them fit an adult."
1.0,These are not true to size. I am a size 8. I ordered a size 8 and my feet could not fit into them without pain
1.0,They don’t fit
1.0,"Did not resemble fabric or print in photo, quite small, poor quality item."
1.0,"A search on Amazon revealed no such equivalent message for girls. I've not seen such misandry since the t-shirt which read ""Boys are stupid. Throw rocks at them."" Listen up, folks. Boys ARE already good humans. Boys are fantastic. Boys are to be celebrated. They are not to be forced to apologize for their existence. This product sends the wrong message and should not be worn by any boy. It is sexist, and goes entirely against the concept of gender equality. Or, was that a lie all along?"
1.0,"I just received this item, but they are not made by MagiCare. Disappointed."
1.0,"I ordered 3 pair of shorts for my husband all size 32 waist. When items arrived all three had different size waist although<br />labels were marked 32. Material is very cheap and and full of wrinkles, huge disappointment  and waste of money.<br />Don't buy these!!!"
1.0,I was able to put the item on fine. It is soft and comfortable but doesn’t give me and snug or firmness in the tummy area. It feels like I have a tank top. I was expecting it to fit snug and really have a trimming effect. I’m not sure about this...gonna wear it all day to see what it’s about😩
1.0,Was super excited about getting this dress. Was super disappointed when I put the dress on and the bottom was sewn on backwards. Getting a refund and will try again...I really want this dress in red for Christmas...bought the green one last year and I love it...it is super comfy.
1.0,Very thin material. More like gauze. Poorly made
1.0,Cheap looking and will wrinkle easily
1.0,I haven’t used it much nor have I overstuffed it and it broke. Kind of a waste of money. Didn’t last a year with little use.<br />No way to fix and no way to return.
1.0,"It looks much cuter in the pics. Once I received them, too big and heavy for my ear. I returned them."
1.0,I purchased this as a Christmas present. It didn't make it to February before I had to repair several seams. The more I repair the more rip open. The craftsmanship on this garment is terrible. It's too late to return it for a refund or I would do exactly that.
1.0,Compared my other XL shirts this one does not compare. I bought a size up (XXL) and it was still too tight. Luckily my boyfriend is way smaller and this swims on petite body.
1.0,"I thought this was so cute and so warm when it arrive, however the sleeves shredded about 10 minutes into wear.. Don't waste your money"
1.0,crazy how hard the glasses are. we aint robots
1.0,"Too tite,  its  all spandex."
1.0,The one that was sent to me looks like they just folded the fabric over and cut a hole for the neck and arms. It’s very square
1.0,Sizes are not U.S. sizes.  Very small.
1.0,I never got a chance to use them one was broke upon arrival.
1.0,This is women only beg! Its make up bag for women! Stop putting that this is men and women!
1.0,Very hard hurts your feet.
1.0,Felt to cheap
1.0,"This shoes are very uncomfortable. I don't know what happend to Adidas whit this model, I'm a user of this brand and this never happened.<br /><br />I do not recommend you to buy this model."
1.0,I ask for a label to return this and never get anything .. a long  gonna take ?<br />I just want my money back<br />The material of this feels like sand paper and is small too
1.0,"I usually love lilly, especially the rompers, but this does not look good on a curvy body. I wound up returning it."
1.0,Cute but came dirty. So disappointed.
1.0,"Wish it sat flush with my nose, but it sticks up, also don’t believe it’s true titanium. I have 2mm &3mm other nose studs and they are much smaller and dainty these are bulky. Had to use pliers to adjust it tighter so it stayed down and didn’t put up and get caught on clothing and things. Wouldn’t waist my money"
1.0,Not great. They have a weird thick seam in the crotch area where pressure builds from being in the saddle. Would probably work better for mtb and not long gravel rides.
1.0,Will not fit a 10 ft 8 rib umbrella.  Maybe they are using the metric system.  set back.
1.0,"Pretty rings, but much too small. Gave them to my four year old daughter"
1.0,It stinks and you can't get rid of the smell
1.0,"Didn't seem to realize theese are made of cardboard! There a little to big, and the teardrop shape, just doesn't really do it for Valentines! I bought theese for my girls at work, but there just a little to big, they don't really want to wear them."
1.0,Look great but when got on the highway sucks. lot of wind chimes in through the side vent. Had my eyes watering. Don't recommend.
1.0,Each earring has very obvious and different size and color rocks
1.0,"While unboxing I noticed small scratches on the gold part of two tone bracelet next to the watch case. Watch wasn’t running, but I didn’t bother installing provided battery. I just returned watch at UPS Store which charged me $3.50 because of the open end box the watch came in- So much for free returns."
1.0,This thing arrived strangely rigid and fragile. It broke in half as I was taking it out of the package. There is something very wrong with this product.
1.0,"quality it horrible.  Don't expect it to hold up for than a few wearings.  Too bad, by daughter loved the bling."
1.0,Fits very short and the fabric is itchy as hell. Wouldn’t buy
1.0,Very tight fit.  My daughter wears 10/12 and I ordered 14/16 mainly for length but the shirts are skin tight.  Do not recommend at all.
1.0,"Once I opened the package and placed the headphone on my 5yr olds head he cried in pain. Each side has a metal piece that attach the ear muffs to the headband and there is a pointy end on each side. When you place it on the head the pointy ends poke the head. Also, while removing headphone from my child's head they came undone from the metal thing. They are somehow supposed to snap back to it but I couldn't get it to and it appears it will keep coming off if it is able to be put back together. This seems to be a known issue per the other reviews. I do not recommend this item and am sending it back."
1.0,"Too short, material cheap and does not look like the picture."
1.0,doesn’t lift what so ever. Product may work for those with smaller chests.
1.0,The bands are pretty but the springs are too easy. They snap into place but the simplest thing makes them come off the watch. Wore the bands for only 1 day and dropped my watch more times than I can count because they spring didnt fit.
1.0,Weird fit. Short and wide. We are going to find another dress for my daughter to wear in a wedding.
1.0,This cardigan after 3 washes is so rough and not AT ALL soft. I have a rash on my arm from it being irritated from how rough the material is.
1.0,"Compass accuracy is affected when bracelet is closed because the metal, fire starter is magnetized.  The fire starter produces a very weak spark and I doubt would be of any use in starting a fire. Other than the whistle, it’s just a piece of rope."
1.0,"bad quality of masks. Straps are too short, therefore, break easily all the time. Money wasted."
1.0,I ordered a size 44 and received a belt much closer to a size 36.
1.0,It gave me a tickling sensation of the skin causing a desire to scratch
1.0,Crap watch. Date doesnt work. China movement
1.0,Extremely hard to get onto my feet.  I have an extremely wide foot (EEEE).  Very uncomfortable once on my feet.
1.0,"Neat idea, but cheap and cheesy looking. I assumed it was a real coin, but instead, just stamped."
1.0,Changed color after 2 wears
1.0,Fabric and cut are trash
1.0,Too small very chip
1.0,Guys - they're super cute.  The style of them is so flattering.  BUT THEY FALL APART WITH ONE WASH.  I purchased two pairs and BOTH fell apart in the first wash.  The mesh detail just - disintegrates.  And these cost way too much to just eat the cost on one wear.  I'm super upset I can no longer return them.
1.0,"This dress was adorable but even after washing before wearing, the dress stained my daughter and all of the clothes washed with it. Despite several washes by hand, with vinegar and in the machine, the dye will not stop bleeding from this dress. Complete waste of money."
1.0,"Cute as can be, but had to throw them all away, as I could not lock or unlock the door once the cap was on the key - a complete waste of money"
1.0,They run very small and material is very thin u can see through them.
1.0,Would not recommend.  Fabric is dense and it does not fit well.
1.0,Not a good quality shoe
1.0,Shoes looked and smelled fake - returned immediately
1.0,This was very thin
1.0,"These shorts fit well, I liked the length... But after 4 rides with them the zipper quit on me."
1.0,"The picture on Amazon Women's clothing is NOT at all like the pants sent.  The picture shows an ""Aladdin-type"" pant and the pants sent were far from that.  The pants were sent from China, and this was not published when I ordered.  The pants are of cheap material, and the pant leg design is not what is pictures.  When asked for a return, I learned that the seller sent this directly from China..had I known this, I never would have ordered it because it took almost a month to arrive.  The seller offered 1/3 of the price as a refund, but I could keep the pants that I will never wear and were sent as a substitute for what I ordered.  Amazon--please check your Quality Control.  Horrible pants!"
1.0,Product was super comfortable but not with anything. The beanie will not charge making the Bluetooth speaker worthless. Not worth the hassle to return. Do not recommend. Look elsewhere.
1.0,Ugliest cheapest looking dress ever!  Picture is misleading. Friend teased me that dress looked like it came from a flea market in Mexico.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. The bust area isn’t made right. It has a stiff cup that sits way too high up and the cup is massive. Looks awful and isn’t flattering.
1.0,This is not blue at all. Further it is dull and has no sheen at all.  Don't get it
1.0,"not true to size  , had to return"
1.0,"Don’t waste your money, it broke on the second day of wearing it!"
1.0,"I had ordered for 100% cotton material, but what i received was polyester blend. The polyester blend is less expensive (although I paid for 100% cotton). Returning the product."
1.0,"I read the sizing carefully, but the material is awful and see through. I tried to return but seller made it difficult and asked too many questions."
1.0,cheap products
1.0,The lenses look awkward and gave headaches to myself and anyone else that tried them.
1.0,"The lenses scratch really easily, and the polarization isn't up to par at all. We've always loved Spy sunglasses. This is the only option we found for replacement lenses, and they just aren't up to snuff compared to the original lenses."
1.0,"It does not look like the picture, the edges are really sharp and my hair gets caught in it along with other stuff that I touch"
1.0,Broke in half after just a couple of weeks.
1.0,"Loved it when I put it on.  15mins later, one of the straps broke off."
1.0,"Very disappointed....<br />The Ombre top was grey in color. I wore & washed one time on gentle cycle, hung to dry. The pocket, sides & bottom completely piled with material.<br />It arrived with a hole in the pocket!<br />Very cute but horrible quality."
1.0,"Very poor quality, & received it with a unstiched small hole around where the waist connects to top. Disappointed. Especially when looks so cute in picture & waited long time for it. Guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Very disappointed...the 3D effect in the picture is why we purchased this. When we received it, it is nothing more then grey, white circles. Not 3D at all. Nothing like the picture what so ever!! Dont waste you money!! Would give it 0 stars if it were an option!!"
1.0,"The sweater looks quite cute & warm, however upon closer inspection, there were four different areas where it was starting to totally unravel. It had only been taken out of its packaging & not even washed or worn. Poor quality."
1.0,The glasses arrived with dents and scuff marks all over. They are cheap and unable to be worn.
1.0,"I have very few item in it,  it will not close when I put my phone in it.  The reason I bought it was to be able to put my phone inside. I do not have a cover on my phone, very disappointed in this product."
1.0,The material is wayy tooopo cheap!
1.0,They lie irs not re chargeable and does not have a charger even.
1.0,this cross is awesume everyone who sees it asks where i got it i have given so many away even to strangers when they tell me of there hardships i definatley need to order more
1.0,"Material was much cheaper than what’s shown in the image, but that’s to be expected for the price. Mostly upset that it’s not the proper length for a choker; it hung all the way down to my collar bone when I put it on, and I wasn’t looking to have even more necklaces like that."
1.0,"Horrible , cheap and looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,The hinges on the back do not stay closed and comes with regular backs on the posts which tells me they knew the earrings do not work as pictured.
1.0,The pearls were already falling apart and missing pearls from necklace..
1.0,"Terrible. Ordered a size up just to be safe; product was 3 sizes too small, despite the tags. Judging from other reviews, this seems to be a common occurrence with this vendor. Don’t buy."
1.0,"You know the oldest t-shirt in your dresser?  It's got holes in the seams on the shoulders, but you keep it because you got it at some concert/in college/on a fun trip/whatever.  You wear it to paint in now, or something like that.  It's worn extremely thin, and you could easily tear it to shreds.  There are little holes in it everywhere.  You can see right through it.<br /><br />That's the material these things are made of.  They are so thin that they had holes in them very first day my son wore them (UNDER other clothes).  The snaps are so tight that I couldn't open them without ripping even bigger holes.  These things are useless, and I'm sorry I wasted my money.<br /><br />Seriously.  Lots of holes.  The VERY FIRST TIME he wore them.  Unbelievable.  Junk."
1.0,DO NOT BUY!  These bracelets are misspelled and the grammar is off.  Sending back after getting them 10 minutes ago.
1.0,These are way to small for a small.  It a childs size.
1.0,Hated it... cheaply made... warped instantly
1.0,"It's not a sterling silver ring, cheap material that you can break it so easily and  arrived tarnished."
1.0,Does not work.
1.0,I ordered a small but its too big and also cheaply made.
1.0,"The original description of this scarf was quite deceptive. It was described as including a battery pack and heating elements inside the hand pockets, but neither was true. It is a fuzzy scarf with a small area of heating coils in the neck area and a USB plug sticking out one end. The scarf does not heat unless you are plugged into a power source, and there is no heating element in either hand pocket. After I complained and asked for a refund, the vendor refused and the description was updated to indicate that no heater (battery) was included because of shipping regulations. This was a wasted purchase."
1.0,Cheap material not worth half of the money I'm returning cheap cheap material
1.0,Both chain burst and came apart before I left my home.. I had to wear another dress. I was so disappointed with my purchase
1.0,Very hard to work with for seniors with arthritis.
1.0,"It was wadded up, unfolded and stuffed in a bag."
1.0,"Cheap material, bust area too small, received all wrinkled.  Going to return"
1.0,Really small and cheap
1.0,This dress is super short! Nothing like pictured. I am 5’1 and it hit at my shins. Returned.
1.0,I got this for my girlfriend and upon opening the package it was in she found that it was damaged/torn where two seams come together so I returned it. On the option page that comes up when you initiate a return it asks if you want a replacement and I chose yes. Upon receiving the second item we opened the package and saw that it was ALSO damaged/torn in the exact same place as the first one. As a matter of fact we would have assumed that this was the same exact dress if we still didn't have the original one because we hadn't returned it yet. Both dresses have been returned and we won't be ordering the same one again. Obviously there quality control is not good at all.
1.0,They sell these as long pants- unfortunately they are not! Seeing as they came from overseas it’s not worth the cost of shipping to return them.
1.0,Long cut so you can’t wear it unticked
1.0,Not true to size especially if you are top heavy.
1.0,"“Oversized”, it just looked frumpy. Not flattering at all"
1.0,Super cheap fabric and sewn all messed up. Don't buy it.
1.0,Put these in and 2 days later my ears were infected.  Ended up having to go back down to a 2 bc I couldnt wear anything in them for 2 weeks.
1.0,Unfortunately the mask arrives completely damaged
1.0,I wanted to love it but didn't happen. First of all it doesn't really fit for a wrist of 5.5 inches. It is loose.  My wrist is 5.65 inches and it is still loose. So I twisted it like some other buyers did. After less than a month of using it today it broke.
1.0,Didnt realize it was see through
1.0,These will fit an 8-9 yr old. Don't expect them to fit a teenager.
1.0,"You really do get what you pay for....Okay, out of the reviews I've done (like 7) this is the first review Ive done that is less than 3 stars. These rings are really crappy! First of all they run small--the heart and the feather rings--the other two are okay. Second of all, they start turning pink the next day and green by the first week. They are just a waste of money, I threw mine out by the first week."
1.0,The sash was exactly what we needed......until the pin fell off the bow as the flower girl walked down the aisle.  I am not happy and do not recommend purchasing a bow and sash from this seller.
1.0,Not what I expected- the color is more like peachy gold but fits well
1.0,"This blouse is too short and the sleeve openings too sMall to wear in oversized comfort. One needs to have a slim, short frame"
1.0,Returned. A bit flimsy for the potential abuse by air travel. Would not trust my belongings to arrive in one piece. Other ebag products fantastic. You get what you pay for and if you travel a lot like me you need good quality bags to check and/or carry.
1.0,This 3xl shirt is a full size smaller than my other cutter and buck 3xl polo shirts
1.0,"Somewhat small, but very gross fabric almost a tablecloth feeling. See through and uncomfortable."
1.0,P.O.S.
1.0,"Wanted to love this. Cute idea with versatile sizes, BUT the SMELL was so awful I had to get it out of the house and give it Goodwill. Plastic? Chemicals? Not sure, but it gave me a headache. Tried to air it out for three weeks, but still strong and intolerable. Don’t recommend."
1.0,"This shirt runs small,,"
1.0,I ordered 1 size too big. I'm an XL and ordered 2XL. The labels say 3XL but are Mediums. One pair has no hole for the button. Severely disappointed.
1.0,I didn't receive the correct product!
1.0,I am a 38C and got a 40c and it was too small
1.0,Very tiny earrings but they do match the picture.
1.0,This jumpsuit was not as expected. Looked cheap and material was see through didn't even waste time to try it on before returning it
1.0,All I can say is to small . didn't even get to ware them.
1.0,So see through!! Horrible.
1.0,not even close to fitting me/would have to go up 2 sizes
1.0,cheap material. the metal-looking piece is simply made out of plastic it can break anytime.
1.0,Pants shrink after one wash and after a few uses the seams started to pull and holes appeared at seams - avoid!
1.0,2x fit like a medium. Arms where short. Not a good buy. I even gave to my kid who is a medium and she couldnt fit it.
1.0,Didn’t like this mask at all!
1.0,"Dress didnt look anything like the picture, we ended up returning"
1.0,Not matching lining and facings.  bottom of zipper doesn't zip up so no sitting in this coat..  Only 3 snap on front if you want to skip the zipper and sit. Hood is over sized and not removable.
1.0,Cheap quality. Ugly shape of dress. Do not buy it. also seller don't want to accept Free return. lie !!!!
1.0,Product is not as it appears. The sizing is completely wrong!  Ordered a size 14 and it fits like a size 6. Very small in size and material is sub standard. Never had a chance to wear it and just threw it away. Was so disgusted with this.
1.0,"Screen print was messed up, large gap in flower print from the shirt being folded while the print was applied. Disappointed in quality."
1.0,This isn't really what I had expected. WAY too small 😑
1.0,"Bought in a small and medium.. both had broken zippers that kept getting stuck. One was completely ripped. I own other GK dresses, and the medium fit best.  Didn't take any pictures on, because both dresses looked awkward and cut uneven."
1.0,"Incredibly tight. I was intending to return it, but there was a problem with the return label so Amazon refunded me and told me to keep the product. I donated it because I had no use for this dress. Somewhat shiny, feels like a swim suit."
1.0,They were tarnished. So only the tunnels are stainless steel. Not very happy!
1.0,Broke a little over a month after receiving. Not sure what I was expecting though.. wouldn't recommend
1.0,The model in this picture must be 6 foot tall because I am a little more than 5’7” and it came to my knees. I ordered a medium. I wear a 36B and it was very tight in my chest area. Sadly had to a send it back!
1.0,The glasses come bent seemed way to big for the average person. Terrible would not recommend even at the low price.
1.0,"Color said dark blue, but was more of s light wash. It said Capri length (and I’m very tall) and was like a long pant. Very tight in thighs and lose in waist and lower leg (and I’m not thick thighed). Weird fit. I returned mine."
1.0,"Nice material but much too big!  Very baggy in thigh and rear areas.  Not true to size., And no pockets as advertised.  Made for a size 22 or 24."
1.0,Glad I hadn't left the house yet or would have resulted in a very embarrassing moment.  Do not recommend.
1.0,You get what you pay for. These are poor quality and appear as though you are wearing a garbage bag.
1.0,I don't like anything about this dress cheap material. I will be returning this ugly dress!!.
1.0,"This is a nice evening dress. However it is small for its size. I would have thought the way it is it would have some give but it does not. It has a zipper on the side and no give whatsoever. It is a very cute design. I am 5'7"" and about 200lbs and usually wear a L to XL. An L in this does not fit and I don't think a XL would fit either.<br /><br />I really like the color and the design but the sizing is definitely not right unfortunately. It is also not as it is shown in the picture, not nearly as off shoulder and the neck line is different too. The material is also rather super thin. Paying almost $40 seems a bit expensive in my eyes. Based on sizing issues and material for the price this is sadly a fail for me."
1.0,"You dont get what you pay for... Very cheap quality, it might break in your hands."
1.0,Cheap material broke easily
1.0,"Defective product. I returned it and ordered again but not even second order was good.<br />Bands does not fit, they are defective. Waste of money!!!"
1.0,"Even after replacing batteries, this ghost trap won’t open. The lights are turning on but the mechanism that opens the doors on top of the ghost trap won’t work to open it up. So sad because it was a gift for our little one who is such a fan of ghostbusters. I hope we can get a refund or new working ghost trap."
1.0,"Recieved in the mail in a padded envelope.  Wrong watch, plastic wrist band not clean steel as noted in the product description, rectangular face not round.  Not as seen the picture."
1.0,"The quality is actually quite good for the price. However, the faux wrap front is just a mess. The front is so ill fitting it can't even be properly pinned. The waist of the dress is also defective. It is unaturally high in the front."
1.0,They were too bulky.😕
1.0,"Looks different from the picture, not as well “put together”, wish it was better.  Also, the case it came in isn’t snug on the ring, it noticeably moves around while in the box.  Sadly I can’t display it like I do my others but because it doesn’t fit snug it doesn’t stay in when the box is set a specific way."
1.0,I didn’t like the fabric on this dress. It felt kind of like a Halloween costume. It would get super cold feeling in cold weather. It’s not a cotton type material like I had thought.
1.0,Seems really long even with it being a maternity ring.
1.0,breaks very easy
1.0,Sloppy embroidery I wanted all black and there was green under the front of it not satisfied at all for all the money I paid
1.0,Way to small looked more like pajamas
1.0,"Muy mala compra, yo que compro bastante. No me gusto para nada, totalmente diferente a como se ve"
1.0,this dress is super low low quality. More like a holloween costume. It doesn't look as classy as the picture! I returned the very same day!
1.0,"The product is supposed to have ten 3-pocket pages (30 total). What I received had only 8 pages and 6 of them were installed upside down (the pocket opening was on the bottom). No response from Seller Feedback.  Too bad, the product would have been great otherwise.  I just can't use it as is.  Will be returning it."
1.0,Maybe it's European size based because it was no where fitting like a 2x plus size. I have a pear shape and this jumpsuit just wasn't flattering
1.0,Much larger than expected and not the best quality
1.0,"undocumented Asian Sizes. For people who purchase according to bra cup size, order 4 sizes larger than normal."
1.0,If i could give 0 stars i would the item came malfunction the charm was turned inside out tried turning it around and all the things i could but it was placed incorrectly if i were to place it the right way stichiching and everything would be wrong DO NOT BUY!
1.0,These appeared to be very nice slippers. But my husband wore them once and on the first time the sole ripped in the middle on the outside. Just completely ripped off. So I would definitely not buy these again or recommend them. Very cheaply made
1.0,not as advertised/came with no logo on the side of glasses /false advertising
1.0,Cute and all until you wash them 😫
1.0,"Was not like the photo where there is no silver showing in front. Looks like someone just put a sticker earring on the post and it’s not even on right, it’s not centered correctly. Looks like a 5 year old did it. I was really looking forward to giving these to my daughter, I have no idea what I’m going to do with them now, they are not worth giving as a gift, I’d be totally embarrassed."
1.0,Too confusing to program.  Had to get someone else to do it.
1.0,When I received this I loved it but it is very flimsy and broke within a week. Since it wasn't that expensive I decided to order another one instead of returning it. Got the second one and again within a week it broke. I tried to return and it says I can't. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Fingers are too short, glove is too fat and loose."
1.0,My ears have have had 4 holes in each over 30 years. These are so small they worked down into the holes and cut them to shreds in less than 24 hours.
1.0,ROSE FELL OFF IN MY CAR... WASTE OF MONEY.
1.0,Earrings both curve in the same direction instead of opposite direction.
1.0,i liked the shirt very much but it is marked 3Xxx and it is very small  not good  i wonder that it is because it is made in china  everything else i buy from you fits  it will have to give it away  you are not representing the companies well  thanks eddie solar
1.0,You will need to walk around the umbrella every time you open it to make sure the cloth is attached to the hooks.
1.0,loved the joggers but when i woke up this morning it stained my bed sheets!
1.0,"The feel of these leggings are super soft, but after less than a half dozen wears, the butt/seat of the leggings ran (the way pantyhose do) and caused a couple holes. A teacher at my daughter's school pointed it out...uh EMBARRASSING!!"
1.0,I was disappointed that the rose gold band didn't match the rose gold Apple iWatch. I personally didn't like the color difference. It was also rather large in size.
1.0,"Pants are capri length, not full length"
1.0,"Worst quality ever. Looks nothing like the photo, came wrapped up in a ball with plastic wrapping under it. Doesn’t have any wire in the bra and it just awful material that you can tell is cheap. Do not buy at all."
1.0,"Nowhere in the description does it say this is a model kit with tons of pieces that you have to put together.  Very light plastic and even if I were in the mood to glue a car kit together, it still isn’t worth the money."
1.0,Iam not very happy with the belt the latch doesn't hold very well
1.0,"So disappointed. Same size, different fit. I bought a pair at Walmart that are better than these. Nothing special for the outrageous price"
1.0,Not winter boots. Very thin and flimsy material.
1.0,"I was excited to receive my new hat, but when I opened the package - the top of the crown (smooth surface) had a manufacturing defect.  The hat has a layer of material that causes the hat to float if in the water, and this layer had this PERMANENT CREASE where two pieces were sewed together during it's assembly.  This crease shows when wearing this hat and since it's permanent, it won't go away after it's washed.<br /><br />I got a full refund from Amazon (Thank You) immediately, and ordered a slightly different model which is arriving in two days just in time for my trip to Alaska.<br /><br />This must be a popular style because I checked and no other websites had them in stock, and this one must have been the last one that they had.  Where was Tilley's quality assurance/control on inspecting their hats BEFORE they leave their factory?  Probably asleep.....  It never should have made it out of their factory.  Shame on you Tilley....<br /><br />If I'm paying $120.00 for a hat, I damn well want one that doesn't have a permanent defect!"
1.0,Quality looks like I bought it from the flea market. So tacky.
1.0,I normally wear Alfani size 16 but the size 16 was too small from amazon.
1.0,"You get what you pay for, this item was definitely too good of a price to be true. If i could give 0 stars, I would.. Came in a giant Amazon envelope. When I opened it the actual ring was all crooked and warped and the flower was not even attached.  The actual nose ring is so flimsy and both the flower and nose ring look super cheap. In order to get my money back now I have to go find a place to print the label ans drop it off. Such a pain in the a$$ for $8 ."
1.0,"Color was really drab, not a pretty light pink rose gold. I sent it back."
1.0,The worst purchase I have made!!! So very disappointed...the material looks and feels like super cheap looking sleep wear
1.0,These fits so bizarrely I can’t imagine them looking good on anyone’s body. There’s something weird going on with the front and I don’t know why. I am mediately sent them back. They are just terrible. The color is good I suppose but they are laughably weird looking.
1.0,It's is not pretty just brassy and ugly
1.0,The quality of the fabric wasn’t as expected.  Could see thru the material.  Returned the dress.
1.0,This dress could never be worn in public. It’s very see through. I’d definitely wear it to a pool party though!
1.0,I ha e to send them back they are way too small.
1.0,"The quality it is too bad, i do not recomend buy this product, the guide not good do not explain nothing...i hate it"
1.0,The best way to describe this dress is ridiculous! About what you’d expect from a $20 dress. I bought 2 and both of them are a disappointment.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed in the watch. My daughter got it for Christmas. She is obsessed with anything L.O.L. Wore it on her wrist for less than 2 hours. Started giving off high pitched, continuous beep. Scared her! I took it off and could not get it to stop. The watch became hot to the touch. I am not happy about this particular product."
1.0,I need to return it.  It is HUGE.
1.0,Seam on the back is already coming undone after wearing four times
1.0,"Dress is super cute, and it also fits well, im 5'7 130 pounds got size small, but the material is cheap as soonest I tryed on the dress ripped, never got to wear it."
1.0,"Cheap material and super thin, the white ones are completely see through. Tiny pockets and the sizes run small."
1.0,Xxl is xxs this would not fit past my thighs
1.0,I think I would love them if I could keep them on.  The heels keep slipping off.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Wish I could give 0 stars. Not comfortable fabric at all. Almost scratchy. Didnt even cover my nipples and I am not big chested. Also thong is too wide so very uncomfortable.
1.0,I ordered this item and the item clasp broke in less then
1.0,Was so excited to get it and not be cold working in the weather this winter. Finally got it and on high gave off almost no heat. Definitely not worth it
1.0,"Seriously weird fit. As nearly as I can tell, they inadvertently sewed to call backs“ together instead of a back and a front. So you have a nice wide pooch in the front if you have a beer belly somehow? Does not work even remotely. More quality control issues."
1.0,Don't like them
1.0,"I have a 34"" inch waist. I ordered the large to allow for under layers. My under layer was just Adidas joggers, very thin. I could not button the pants at all."
1.0,It's too big.
1.0,Sweatshirt had missed stitching along the bottom. The hood drawstring was too short so there was a piece tied on.
1.0,Off white color. Panties are huge. Just not what I expected. Not happy with product.
1.0,Very cheap. I'm disappointed. I wish I never purchased 2 of these.
1.0,"I loved it at first. The watch is really cute,  but does not keep time well. Now l use it for a keychain."
1.0,I loved it when I first put it in...but within the first month all the stones fell out.  Very unhappy. Hopefully the 2nd one doesnt do the same
1.0,It has a bad smell of mental. I’m worried who ever wears this that the mental may have some type effect on the skin.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY ITS THE WORST $13.00 IVE EVER SPENT , THE SPEAKER IS CRAP THE VOLUME WHST VOLUME YIU CAN BARELY HEAR IT"
1.0,Couldn't pick a size when ordering so figured it would be big enough to fit most medium and large sizes.  I am a medium. Even small for a small size.
1.0,Thumbs Down.  Will only work for very tiny faces. Looks cheap.
1.0,These are terrible. They don’t stay up or look nice. One hand wash and they completely fell apart. I threw them all away.
1.0,These are very poor quality stones. They look beautiful in the picture but they are cloudy and and 2 of the 4 I received are very small
1.0,"Dress looked very cheap, the chiffon wrinkled very easily so the thought of bridesmaids wearing them all day and trying to sit down just wouldn’t work. The cut at the hips wasn’t flattering, makes you look bigger than you are. Customer service was a nightmare trying to return. I wouldn’t buy unless it is Prime."
1.0,"These began coming apart at the seams after a single wash. And the holes aren’t repairable, as it’s a matter of the crappy cloth tearing, not the actual seam. Huge waste of money."
1.0,"Not as pictured. The lining is white, so when the cuffs are rolled they are not black as pictured. Very thin and flimsy. Seller made returning difficult and after multiple requests for a return label they kept offering a 20% discount and did not acknowledge my desire to return it for full refund. Do not buy, not worth it."
1.0,Product very cheap. The anklet broke the same day I got it.
1.0,They stretch out fast and I didn’t care for them.didnt do it for me.
1.0,Very large cheap looking.
1.0,"These came obviously used, covered in some kind of animal hair. I returned."
1.0,Its a shirt on me not a dress.  Its to short and I was so excited to get it. Not happy
1.0,"These are a good deal for long pants which can be difficult to find however the seams are not strong. One outside seam split on the first use. I mended it; however, after going through the wash the other side split."
1.0,"Was very excited when I put the first earring in but got two of the same, so sad :("
1.0,"Unfortunately the glue needs to be stronger or these cannot be used for crocs. Every one I tried to use fell apart. The charm and the back came lose while I was walking, just walking from the car to a restaurant. I was left with the back in my crocs and some glue. I caught a couple charms rolling down the driveway"
1.0,"I am 5""2 hourglass figure, measurements are as followed 38, 22, 42. This dress made me look like a beach whale 🤣"
1.0,Way too small. Should of sized up. My son is 8 months old and this did not fit him
1.0,I lost one the first hour I wore the earrings...hook no long enough & very light in weight
1.0,I have not even used it for a month and the black finish is coming off........I cannot believe that an $80 watch band could be so cheap......do not buy this
1.0,Cheap quality. Straps were very long for the shirt.
1.0,Cheap poor quality the picture is deceiving
1.0,We received tot size gloves.
1.0,Poor quality. Not worth the money.  My 2 year old wore this to dance class once and it’s ruined.
1.0,Very expensive for the quality
1.0,Hoping to send it back..eyes were all sideways and poorly made and size is way off
1.0,Zipper was broken when I received product. Cool hat but not great quality.
1.0,Very difficult to put on. Compass didn't even work. The treads for the rod to twist shut is completely worn off from the moment I first finally was able to get it to lock which didn't stay locked
1.0,Black rose was smashed and disfigured.  Bummer
1.0,Fitting on the body was great but the sleeves were EXTRA LONG. Almost 6 inches longer than normal L shirt sleeves. Looked like a scare crow! Returned it back.
1.0,First off let me just say I ordered this back in October of 2020- it’s February now and I just recently got the ring. It’s not adjustable and the gold is rubbing off when I took it off my finger realizing it didn’t fit I found that it left a terrible stench on my hand. I had to use dish soap and tooth paste to get it off
1.0,"I ordered the 1-3 Years size and they are way to big for my 20 Month old. These socks fit my 4 year old niece, who is in the 90% for height and weight."
1.0,Did not fit and I ordered a size up. Waste of money. Donated it to charity.
1.0,They were way to small. I order the same size in other products and didn’t have this problem. I’m sending them back. Disappointed
1.0,The item I received was not slim fit! The width of the design is somewhat large and the length is too short.
1.0,"I bought these because I teach remotely this year and thought it would be fun to wear cute holiday earrings for the kids since they only see me from the shoulders up.  This was just what I needed, or so I thought!  The design is terrible, instead of dangling down like you would expect, they stuck straight out from the side of your head.  I tried to adjust the hook, but it only made it worse.<br />I will say, however, that the  customer service was great.  I initiated a refund and they responded immediatly, no questions asked.  So, that part was great, but it's probably better to save yourself the trouble."
1.0,It fades away the blue
1.0,Bent easy
1.0,"For $50 I’d expect them to last longer than three uses, but here we are. The right overshoe is coming apart and losing studs."
1.0,"Listing very clearly says 30 pieces. Box says 20 pieces, and there are only 20 pieces inside. Don’t order if you want the right number of pieces!"
1.0,I absolutely loved this sweater when I took it out of the packaging. Looked just like the picture and had a great style.<br /><br />When I took it out to wear it it was coming completely undone at one of the seams! So bummed! I’ve messaged the seller and I am hoping they can fix/replace it as I would easily buy them in every color!
1.0,It was cute while it lasted. The band cracked within the first month and due to that the holes that hold are used to put it on ripped.
1.0,"While these fit fine, the seams split on two pairs after one washing. They are poor quality."
1.0,"Earrings were not what I expected, way too small"
1.0,"Showed up late.<br />Cheap, Most don't work. Waste of time and money."
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter as a warm winter sweatshirt. It's very light. She doesn't care for it because it's so see through, you can see what she is wearing underneath. It also took several weeks to get here."
1.0,"Stretched out after use, not adjustable"
1.0,"These gloves were generous-sized but the seams came undone, exposing my hand in several areas, almost to the point of falling off my hand. I'll ask for a replacement pair. Photo to follow soon..."
1.0,"If you want a weightless mask that does nothing to protect you, then get this one. So thin that I can't believe they actually sell them."
1.0,Look nothing like it does in the photo they are not fitted sweats even though they make them appear to be
1.0,too thin and small. i ordered a large and it looks lije a small
1.0,"Not what I expected for the prize i paid for my nephews birthday present.  One shoe is in perfect condition just there was some defective issues on one of them, a part of the cushion is not properly sown on and is uncomfortable to even have my nephew wear them for his soccer game. I have attached picture of both shoes and you can seen the difference"
1.0,Not well made and is very uncomfortable!
1.0,"Metal looks silver but you can tell it is only a cast metal. The opal is plastic, and that is very evident because the opal coloring only goes down so far on the plastic stone.... very disappointing."
1.0,This is a horrible quality. The 1st one I received had a hole in it and a stain. I received the replacement 10 days ago. I only wear this at work and not even every day. There is a hole in the pocket and another one in the sleeve which is what the last one had.
1.0,The zipper was broken and can’t even try it on<br />Need to have a replacement sent
1.0,"As you can see, just no Grinch visible when the watch is on, so…"
1.0,"I loved it but the second time I wore it I was just walking in the grocery store and it broke. Didn't really get to enjoy it at all, kind of a disappointment."
1.0,"What?????<br />Very disappointed with this Set, purchased as a Graduation Gift.<br />The Black  &#34;Class of 2016&#34; is a sticker covered by a cheap piece of plastic.<br />Looks like some cheap childrens jewelry, very disappointed.<br />The Bracelet Chain is a little better than the Necklace Chain, but still cheap looking.<br />To make it even worse, not an automatic return like other Amazon Purchases."
1.0,Not even the product I ordered!  Some other style of short peacoat with belt....
1.0,Ring material too soft..bends up easily.
1.0,It’s really big I like the material it’s just huge
1.0,Not true to size. Way too small. Very thin.. Returned.
1.0,I was disappointed in the size of these charms
1.0,You can barely even see what’s on the patch. Extremely disappointed and bummed out.
1.0,I place an order for a small and they send me a large not once but twice<br />I returned it for good not worth the money.
1.0,"Bright orange, I was expecting closer to the picture."
1.0,Melted within one week
1.0,I love these earrings but after wearing them only a couple times they pealed apart.
1.0,Poor quality. Laces was not sew in properly and came un done. It fits me well I'm 5'2 and size 1
1.0,"Love this band!  However it arrived defective.  One band too large never latched.  Contacted company with all info they requested, said they would replace.  Unable to wear.  Still waiting for replacement."
1.0,They are not like the regular silicon bands. They do not have the loops to hold the band in place. Instead they have a round ball that goes into the hole to keep the watch on. It kept coming loose and would not keep the watch on your wrist.
1.0,"Is not slim fitting. The fit is long but it is also awkwardly shaped and not slim. More normal sized than slim. And worst part was the material, not high quality and does not look good. Really bummed on this purchase, thought it was going to be a lot better. Good for normal guys, not good for skinny or slim guys like myself"
1.0,Very poor quality did not have very long and all three clips are broke
1.0,Received this shirt looking like this. So dissatisfied!!!
1.0,I liked this bag but after having it for only 4 months it started falling apart and there is no way to contact the manufacturer and Amazon will not do anything.
1.0,I ordered an xxl the pants too big and shirt too small
1.0,first: The Saturn doesn't have his name<br />socond: an extra star came  instead of the other one that should have his name on as well.
1.0,Pretty but broken up arrival.
1.0,Cleats fell out first time we used them.
1.0,I paid for the product but never saw the product.  I should have just burned the money instead.
1.0,Dislike them!! They bother the top of my mouth
1.0,"ordered the pink, received the black instead. very dissapointed"
1.0,THEY ARE THE CHEAPEST MADE CHARMS I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE LETTER BENT WITHIN 1 DAY OF WEARING. I WOULD RETURN BUT IT WOULD COST MORE THAN IT IS WORTH. BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT ORDER THESE
1.0,Started to fall apart and unravel within the first week of use.
1.0,"2 of the 3 came with LARGE scratches on the lenses, and they are much darker than I thought they would be. the image makes them seem mostly transparent, but they are much more opaque. So frustrated about that, but the real kicker was that they arrived scratched. once my sunglasses become scratched they are unwearable for me. too distracting to look through."
1.0,I bought this for my son in December and it no longer works!! Very disappointed didn’t even last 4 months!! 150.00 down the drain!!
1.0,It isn’t even close to as full as the pictures make it out to be! Waste of money!
1.0,Wore these socks 1 time and already have a hole in them
1.0,"Cheap material, order a 2X and couldn't even pull them on, would fit a child for sure"
1.0,"I really liked it when it arrived. When I washed and dried it and only put it in the dryer until it was half dry, 10-15 min it shrank to a child's size."
1.0,Weird foam like material.
1.0,"The item sent was already been washed and has pills all over, it smelled like detergent, and even had stand on the front line near the panel of the leggings. Very disappointed. The fit is nice but color is totally off , not like in picture. Also material is see through, cannot do a squat in this"
1.0,The button came off within the first three hours of wear. After the first wash the material felt almost rubbery (I hung dry to avoid shrinkage).
1.0,Very thin materia. Ripped when I tried it on
1.0,So small that it wouldn't fit on my thigh. I bought a 3x and it was a medium.
1.0,No way these are 5xl maybe 3xl at best
1.0,The plastic keeps falling down which is really annoying 😩!!
1.0,"I ordered this item for an addition to a Halloween costume.  My costume ended up being too large.  I returned that one without any hassels to another company.  When I went to return this item, after waiting 55 minutes on the phone, the company said they would not return it even if it wasn't worn.  Needless to say I was not happy with the purchase and the quality was overall not good. Buy from another company!"
1.0,"Not what I expected; I wanted satin & this is plastic, dull and wrinkly"
1.0,Had to give 1 star because no other choice but I would not recommend. Glasses are too small and frames were too tight.
1.0,"i don't consider my head to be big, but normal size.  the ear covers do not cover both ears...fall short behind the ears, and easily slip off the ears and head.  i will probably be requesting a refund.  the fleece is of poor quality also."
1.0,It was to small and it was a size xxl sold it to my friend who is a size small she's a<br />size 7 and 8
1.0,"These are awful.<br />They are hard and I imagine uncomfortable to wear.<br />It is impossible to get the back on, you can barely remove a back in the first place. One of them the back won’t stay on.<br />Any reasonable pressure applied to push earring stud into the backing will result in earring breaking.<br />One is just misshapen and I am not bothering moving it straight because it’s so cheap it’ll just break sooner than later.<br />Buyer beware. Spend $100 on a similar pair OR $15 on a cheaper pair with better quality.<br />We have a sad birthday girl now. Sending them back."
1.0,Looks great feels great........but the pin broke after installed and now I can never take it off.
1.0,"I ordered the wrist band because I like this feature.  However, when I got it, it is not the same as the picture on advertising.  The seller is not honest, the advertised something and send you something else.  Please careful to buy this seller."
1.0,"what shown on the pic is not what i got different visor, intead of dark i got clear, inter of quick release chin strap i git the manual strap, please add more detailed picture"
1.0,"This garment smelled of a musty dirty odor.  NASTY!  Also, this garment had a 1-1/2 inch hole in it.  Completely unacceptable.  New garment, no way.  Very disappointed.  My daughter Intended this  for Easter.  We,ll as you could imagine, she was very sad to see that she could not."
1.0,Waist off center for more bustuous women.
1.0,It was the wrong color. The hat was not the blue color on the scarf but instead grey.<br /><br />The other one scarf was purple instead of pink.
1.0,I have a bigger butt to waist ratio I got these thinking they would help the issue of my butt showing through when I do squats in the gym as advertised.  I got an XL as size chart suggested for a 34 in waist. HA they were see through on my butt just standing there much less squated uggg.
1.0,Does not look like the picture at all. The material is quite thick. Something you would wear to workout. Not impressed.
1.0,Two different ones
1.0,The hat started unraveling at the top before I could get a chance to wear it!
1.0,Very disappointed in this shirt. The material was very clingy and was to small for a 5&#34;7 frame without your belly button showing.
1.0,Did not say godmother on the inside
1.0,Unbelievable!  Used for the first time. Side bracket broke off and cut up my husbands leg with a screw that was left. Next one of the wheels fell off. Worst luggage we’ve ever used. We are still on vacation and now need to look into buying a suitcase to make it home. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,Not happy with this ring.  I've had it less than a month and it's already turning.  It was shiny and silver the first week and now it's starting to look like copper! I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,I don't like anything about it and would like to send it back.  How do I go about doing that?
1.0,Looks cheap even for the price.
1.0,nope the wuslity of msterial is not as promised ! i expected more .
1.0,"these are bright green, not shown as in photo"
1.0,"I am returning this dress as I don’t like the material nor the fit. I am a size xl, large breasts and butt. The back ruffle hit me right on the buttocks where it isn’t flattering. The material is not soft and noisy. It’s almost the sound of tissue paper. I don’t want to be heard by the sound of my clothes. It just did nothing for me."
1.0,"I hate this bra. It's huge for the size, and the wire is sooooo uncomfortable. I want to return it so bad but I've already washed it to see if that would help. I'm almost at the point where I might rip out the wire and see if I can sew it so that it's not completely ruined."
1.0,Way too tight and small. And I'm small. Almost need a large just to fit!
1.0,OMG I should have figured this would have been crappy for its price point. I will be returning. They are soooo cheaply made and small BTW. Don’t purchase! It’s not worth it
1.0,it broke 5 seconds out of the box
1.0,Piece of junk. Cheap plastic. Broke the first time I took it out of package. Didn't even put it on.
1.0,"Never received the ring. Couldn't tell you what it looks like, or how it fits. I needed it for a cosplay event that has now past."
1.0,"The lenses fell right out of these as I got them out of the box,  the glasses are huge.  I will glue them together some day and rate again."
1.0,Way too small so I will return after vacation
1.0,I'm a size 44. I purchased the XL as it said it was good for up to 45. There is soo much stretch in this belt I have10 inches of excess after it stretches tight enough to hold my pants on. Feels like wearing jogging pants... not secure. If you're up to size 45.. get the large as it stretches a BUNCH! I wouldn't recommend this belt tho.
1.0,"Arrived late even though I paid for expedited shipping.  Came in a bag, not a box that would protect.  Like others said: smells of chemicals.  Cheaply made.  Zipper zips all the way up but buckles arent long enough to buckle.  Shipped with CNE which said it was handed directly to a receptionist or someone at a front desk.  Which is a lie.  It was on my home front porch.  Just a mess all around.  Really disappointed."
1.0,Sewn unevenly. It didn’t  really look like the picture. The fringe is HUGE
1.0,"IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE, however the seller sent me the wrong shipment. Ordered BLACK IT IS DARK NAVY, BEWARE . GOT A MEDIUM FOR COMFORT AT WORK! IT HAS SOFT, FLEXIBLE FABRIC. I AM ABLE TO WEAR A SWEATSHIRT COMFORTABLLY UNDERNEATH. AND THE SLEEVES ARE LONG. try it just BEWARE it's not true black like it says in my order, the seller may send you the wrong item"
1.0,Doesn't fit like the photo. The material feels very scratchy and cheap. Not very happy at all.
1.0,Poor wuality
1.0,The MRS on this bag was printed upside down. This was a bridal gift and I was so disappointed when it was received. Will be returning ASAP.
1.0,"It is very cute, but the top part that clips to the FitBit does not securely clip in, thus releases with just a light touch.  So, this is completely unusable sadly."
1.0,"No compression and poor quality the socks stretched out after 1 wash, and the fabric is not moisture-wicking, after running 10 mins your feet will feel wet, it's very uncomfortable, the socks are a bit thin, can't last a long-running at all, of course, can't help you to avoid blisters too, not recommend it."
1.0,Don't buy this belt. The ratchet is too weak and the belt slips with very minor pressure.
1.0,Horrible material ... it’s thin and poorly stitched. The arm tore when I put it on. Unfortunately I couldn’t ship it back because I’m in the Caribbean and it will cost more than what I purchase it for.
1.0,"The material was a little shinier than I expected, almost like a gym leotard. It's not a pleasant texture. Based on the dimensions and measurements, this skirt should have fit me, however it is so large that it slides down my hips. Unwearable, unable to return, $9.99 down the drain."
1.0,"came in broken and had a cheap look and feel to it, returned the next day."
1.0,"The loops were separated and broken. I did not have high, high hopes for the price...but still disappointed in the quality."
1.0,Upon opening the package I immediately found the seams separating in the v-neck area.  Material is also very thin.
1.0,"This lanyard sucks it is a cheap fake and it is impossible to wear because it's extremely uncomfortable, it itches your neck and it's so uncomfortable it is useless."
1.0,Sent the wrong color. The picture and item description do not match. I went with what the words said. Also arrived later than expected.
1.0,Horrible couldn’t tell what was on mask
1.0,Not as thick as genuine Oakley. Does not fit the frame well and rattles around inside the frame. Easily falls out while cycling.  No Thank you.
1.0,Arrived with huge stain on it.  Never tried it on
1.0,Cheaply made and doesn’t fit well at all.
1.0,"It breaks so easy, i order 2, i put them on and the 1st one lasted 1 day, the second one did make it for more than 1 minute..."
1.0,"Item is way too short; doesn't cover half of my torso. Measured prior to order and it just didn't fit! As far as quality, it is definitely not good. You get what you pay for."
1.0,Cheap cheap material...see through and small fit. Its aweful
1.0,"I didnt even end up wearing this mask. It's been sitting in my car and now its halfway through november so I doubt I will be wearing it at all. Reasons for not wearing it during october:<br />1. It's pretty restricting and hard to breath.<br />2. The image on the mask I was sent is blurry and it's not even clear what it says or who the images are portraying to be.<br />3. There is no glitter or rhinestones on it like the images suggest. It's a very flat, blurry image with even more blurry text."
1.0,I saw this exact hat at the dollar store! Why pay $10!?
1.0,Short in length and rusty orange not red in color.  Returned.
1.0,"The boobs are extremely padded and huge, for D cups for sure. Will not be buying cheap things from China again, you get what you pay for. And then the cost to ship it back is ridiculous, so its a loss."
1.0,Gets loose very fast....not good for everyday use.
1.0,It broke after one wear. I’ll never buy from this seller again.
1.0,Bought this mask for our haunted trail at camp for Son to scare the little ones.  The mask didn't even last an entire day.  The wire came right out of the control.  Would not recommend this item.
1.0,Fabric is sheer even the black ones and they are about a size and a half too small they don't really stretch. Keep ya money and go to Walmart or a hair store
1.0,Dress had a rip and n side of it.
1.0,It’s horrible feels amd looks like a black plastic bag
1.0,Realmente no es como la descripción no cumple con lo dicho es cualquier lentes lo ciento
1.0,"not true to size, ordered other shirts at the same time, same size, all fit fine.  this one I could not even get over my chest! very disappointed, size is way, way, way, way off."
1.0,"This wasn't a good quality shirt. The arm openings were ridiculous tight. I'm a 105 woman and still it was too tight. There were strings attached hanging, making it even poorer quality."
1.0,I normally wear a 2x in men’s T-shirt’s so I ordered a 2x. It was way too small. It didn’t stretch at all and didn’t even begin to cover my chest area. I ended up having to return it.
1.0,"Sent them back,  zipper broke when I tried them on, so disappointed."
1.0,"This is useless, unless you just want a cute hat. The shield is a separate piece from the hat, and is constructed in a way that you have to tie it around your baby's head. Have you met babies? I don't know a single one that would sit still long enough to try to get this to fit on them. If you do, MAYBE this would be a good purchase for them, but I'm skeptical it would stay on very long given the construction of the overall visor piece."
1.0,Not nice looking has 1 thing inside big disappointment
1.0,Has a small tear in side and if ur a large busted woman it fits really strange.
1.0,"These fit and feel so good and I wanted to love them SO bad, but unfortunately they DO NOT pass the squat test.  You can see right through them when you squat.  The color that I tried was the dark green."
1.0,"Very thin material, they have very little support"
1.0,HORRIBLE!!!!!
1.0,It’s pink FYI. I returned mine
1.0,"Great looking shirt, but it runs about two sizes smaller than what you normally wear."
1.0,"Nicely made, feels nice on, and made for a great layer for cold weather bike riding.  I loved it....all two times I got to wear it before the zipper fell off."
1.0,The area around the arms is way too large. I will never get this type of dress again
1.0,"Longer wait to receive it. Bulky, the silver part keeps coming off.Wasted my money won’t order again!"
1.0,This coat's size HAD TO BE mislabeled.  I purchased it for someone almost adult size and I was sent a toddler sized coat.  I have never known a toddler to be ab16/18.
1.0,"Not all the lights work, my 4 year old loves it but it’s frustrating I spent my money on something that doesn’t work the way it should"
1.0,This is not a toddler size at all. I ordered the 3 to 4T. It is way too big on my son I don't understand why they would list this as a site as a sizing for toddlers
1.0,I disliked the product overall. The product isn't intended for use. Before buying ask the seller plenty of questions about it. Overall item was not great for use. The materials that the item is made of isn't good and will not last for a month.
1.0,Poor quality didn't even last the night. if i knew it was made out of two headbands stapled to card board and half a package of feathers  glued on I would have made it myself.
1.0,I received this dress today and it was worn. It also had makeup stains on it. Sad.
1.0,"Not worth it,  fits uncomfortable"
1.0,"These socks are awful, the heel comes halfway up my leg and falls down throughout the day. I have washed several times in hot water trying to shrink them to fit my normal size 7.5 feet. Not worth the buy!"
1.0,Clasp doesn't work
1.0,Cheap and very sporty. Not casual at all.
1.0,I bought these glasses for my son. They did not work for his color blindness. I returned them today.
1.0,"The colors are fantastic- very packable yes, but it is super uncomfortable to put anything but beach towels or blankets inside..."
1.0,"doesn't fit, has no elasticity, and the straps in the back are a complete mess. they do not sit anything like in the photo. Don't waste your time"
1.0,"Not durable, NOT skid proof, the only Support is around the ankles. I think this shoe might of lasted a week."
1.0,Most bracelets are too big for me because I have small wrists.  This one fit except for the bar.  It was curved so much that it stood up off of my wrist.  Returning.
1.0,The clothes came Stained
1.0,"Me decepciono! Ya había comprado un extensible de la misma marca (diferente modelo) y muy bien pero este, resultó horrible<br />Muy duro, de mala calidad, se rompió una correa y no es posible cambiar el broche dorado del reloj original al para que combine. El que trae es plateado y de mala calidad<br /><br />No me gusto para absolutamente nada. No gastes tu dinero con este producto"
1.0,Look at all the pictures.  They lead you to believe it’s a realistic quality mask but really cheap junk.
1.0,"While these were true to size, the straps broke on one of them after wearing them around the house for less than 2 days. There was no circumstance that happened in which this would've occurred. I've bought cheaper thong slippers that have lasted much longer. I also didn't like the hard sole bottom - made these not as squishy and comfy as they looked/I had hoped. Will not buy again."
1.0,Is to large I require large for teenager no for adult.
1.0,I had high hopes for these sandals. The straps are strange and pulled my feet forward and the back of my foot was pulled to the side and kept slipping off the foot bed. I returned them.
1.0,"Poor quality, form of hat is not set; actually arrived as flat hat, seems used poor, cheap or wrong material; sawing not well  - noticed a whole 3cm... I am not sure if i can alternate it and keep it?!🤔 I'll try stop by to hobby-lobby and think how to fix the form/shape."
1.0,This is plated and not sterling silver....very disappointed.
1.0,"I got the white. It is very white. A true white. It fit beautifully, but was see through. Also the slit goes all the way up. My 4 year old ruffled it and my whole bum was out there to see.<br /><br />Not a mom friendly dress.<br /><br />But would be totally cute for a bride to be or for a honeymoon."
1.0,thinking about returning it .....Too small it is like a ladies watch.  I like a larger one.  how do I return them?<br /><br />Ed
1.0,This come broke 😩😩😩😩😩😩
1.0,If I could give this no stars I would. It’s thin and the material is cheap.  It looks cheap.  Just horrible :(
1.0,This is a waste of money. They do not glow as written in the description. I am highly disappointed with these charms and an A was missing. 46 pieces. Not worth it
1.0,Way too long! Unwearable!
1.0,I don't like to buy it again
1.0,Product stated Size XXX but fit like a XL
1.0,I wore it for a week and it broke and i almost lost my watch
1.0,Very cheaply made. Shrank after first wash
1.0,"Weird fit, very large on the chest area but the armholes were too small"
1.0,Makes you look pregnant and it’s really short
1.0,Did not like the material with a sparkle mixed in the cloth
1.0,It runs small on the shoulder
1.0,The compass points to the opposite way of the correct direction. I didn't notice this problem until I compared it with my iPhone compass.
1.0,Right strap is longer then the left so the white lining shows and it sags. Very disappointed.
1.0,Came in broken. Not happy at all
1.0,The shirt appeared to be great until I realized there were misspellings in the names in the back of the shirt. I was embarrassed to realize it after a handful of times my children worn them. Other than that they would of been perfect. What a bummer!!
1.0,Color went clear and doesn't look anything like pictures. Fiancee is very upset
1.0,"In accurate web description, package was damaged and the nose rings are so small they can be used for a barbie doll earrings. Every last one was of a dull silver color."
1.0,"I loved the color, it was just what my husband wanted. We where happy with the purchase, he had to wear it right away. Two hours into the night the glass face plate fell off and broke :(. Would have been a 5 star rating otherwise."
1.0,Worn once and an hour into wearing this shirt the neckline came apart almost to the point of showing my goods the waiter gave me a pin to pin my top back together
1.0,"So far very frustrated, I ordered 2 small black skirts, got 1 XL black and 1 XL pink.  So I reordered 2 small black and got 2 large.  If you don't have the product, please just let me know, you're wasting my time and it's very irritating...<br /><br />As far as the skirts go they seem to fit if you look at the size chart"
1.0,Snaps on pockets kept breaking now the fly snap broke. Poor quality product.
1.0,THIS IS A AWESOME DEAL I JUST GOT A BRACE LET THAT WAS ON CORD AND IT WAS $12 AND THIS ONE IS LEATHER AND MADE A LOT BETTER
1.0,What I liked the most is the shape I was disappointed because for the price I expected better workmanship and better quality leather. So I was unhappy with the bag.
1.0,Do not buy these. So poorly made the posts get smashed and bent during shipping. Save your money for a better pair.
1.0,Only able to use them once.  I tried to reuse and it would not stick properly and would fall off😔
1.0,"Way, way too small to do anything with! I was going to put on my grandmothers birthstone necklace due to the picture. Don't even have a clue what I could use these for because of being extremely small."
1.0,"Poorly made, cheap material.  Didn't last 6 months!"
1.0,"Did not like the fit or fabric, won’t recommend"
1.0,Flimsy and thin. It doesn't fit well at all on my face. Not worthy of the price.
1.0,Not really sized for a little kid. I'm an adult woman - admittedly with small wrists - but it was too big even on me so definitely didn't fit my 5yo.
1.0,"I wear a XL, so I ordered an XL. The package said XL, but I didnt see the size on the dress.  I hoping them made a mistake and placed a small in the package instead of an XL. I was barely able to put the dress over my breast."
1.0,It was huge and Gotti and I would never wear it in public
1.0,I bought the silver and gold and the stones fell out within less than a month.  I contacted the seller and they wanted me to send them back so they can receive a refund.  I stated that I did not want to have to go to the post office or the UPS store to return the 2 toe rings and they did not reply back.  Do not buy these items.  They are pretty but the stones are not set in right where they cannot fall out.  I know they are inexpensive and I guess you get what you pay for.  This is the third toe ring I have bought where the stone has fallen out.  The other dealer was nice enough to send me a new one without me having to send the broken one back.  It not like I wear sneakers all the time.  I am usually barefoot at home or I wear flip flops.  I'm in Florida.  I would of been nice for this dealer to offer a UPS call tag or replacements.  I don't think I would of taken the replacements because of the quality of the way the stones are set.  Just remember you get what you pay for.
1.0,Did not like it and my friends think that it's a nursery scrub
1.0,It's cheap and arrived broken. The smaller necklace fits more like a choker than a necklace.
1.0,This may be one of the itchiest dresses I have ever tried on. Definitely wouldn’t be able to last more than a couple minutes in it as my arms kept feeling scratchy. It’s more snug than in the photo but it wasn’t too small. I would suggest looking at other options.
1.0,Broke same day(wow)
1.0,"For what I paid-this costume is crap. A lot of money for poor quality, no give in the shirt, I had to cut the neck to get it to go over my child’s head! Save your money! Don’t buy!"
1.0,"I bought these as a gift for a child in need for a ""Giving Tree"" at work.  These came in a plastic bag with no tags or anything on them.  They looked so cheap, I'd have been embarrassed to give them to the child.  I ended up going to Target to get a nicer Dearfoam brand.  I will donate these to Goodwill and perhaps someone else can benefit from them."
1.0,The collar is awkward...cheap.
1.0,Read the reviews I ordered an xs because I am normally a small and this fits like a potato sack.
1.0,Wore for less than an hour and the red and blue lights stopped working.
1.0,"My kid liked the design and it was priced cheap, but of course it’s as cheap and flimsy as it is priced."
1.0,would not recommend<br />Poor Product<br />Great Presentation
1.0,Bad instructions
1.0,It's very small and the color is very light.  I'm not sure if it's a really gold. I'm disappointed.
1.0,Broken zipper. Seriously will not budge even hanging on the hanger.
1.0,It doesn't look exactly as advertised and it is super small. It's more like a charm than it is a pendant.
1.0,"This item was made for a very small child, not a woman"
1.0,"I can already feel a rash erupting from the cheap (probably toxic) plastic. This piece is overpriced. The color of the necklace is actually darker than the photo entails. I feel ripped off although it is a cute necklace. But I cannot recommend this product. Nope, not today."
1.0,"Not what I expected. Fits very tight on the ears, nose metal not confortable"
1.0,This Chinese bad quality dress is worth 99 cents! It is ridiculous and want my money back!
1.0,Sub par on every level .<br />Over priced junk. ....
1.0,This product was much smaller than expected although I requested the size I normally wear.
1.0,The underwire was extremely uncomfortable; wasn’t able to wear it the entire day.
1.0,Material faded
1.0,"Ordered XL, it more along the lines of a medium.  Pictures imply a longer length (over the butt) but it is barely waist length."
1.0,"Ordered correct strap for my 433LSLC, according to the website. This is a listing error in size. My 433LSLC needed a sprig rod attachment, NOT SCREWS. Item returned. Very frustrating."
1.0,Useless. The shield was bent and flabby.
1.0,Material is shear and not soft as expected
1.0,the item that arrived looks nothing like the cute army green picture.  The tunic that arrived is seriously celery green and made of a stretchy material.  It costs 1/2 the price to return.  I guess I can give it to Good Will unless a friend​ likes celery green in stretch material.
1.0,"Extremely thin, fragile, lightweight.  Will snap in a heartbeat in thick coarse hair.  I will just decorate a gift box with it"
1.0,"Horrible, I give 0 stars. The fabric is hard, it doesn’t look at all as advertised."
1.0,Dislike the print job. It looks bad up close. Far away and online looks better. Expected vinyl or better quality. Screen printed and blotchy print .<br />Still rock my Arsenal pride but disappointed in quality
1.0,"Sooooo cheaply made, broke in five minuets, save your pennies."
1.0,Completely fell apart. Don’t buy
1.0,Fabric is very thin and dress is way too short. I was however able to wear it as a top.
1.0,The dress was poor material and wasn’t the actual size it didn’t fit me
1.0,Smaller than what I expected and one of them was bent
1.0,"Do not buy this product it does not correspond to what is indicated on this site, the quality is so bad!!!!!"
1.0,"This watch is total garbage, its a waste of money not only did it come broken the buttons are very hard to push! DO NOT BUY STAY AWAY"
1.0,The material is cheap. Would not purchase again.
1.0,Only because I have to give a star. Missing half of the centerpiece when it arrived.
1.0,"It fits loose in weird places. I’m usually not picky, and bathing suits generally fit me ok. This one fits loose in the front and it’s bigger than usually on the top. Just weird."
1.0,NO GOOD MDSE.
1.0,Pretty but stabbed and pinched skin.
1.0,"These straps are not usable and I had to throw them away.  They could be be good and I liked the way they worked though I would have like them to be a couple of inches longer.  The problem is that the rubber like length cinch part smells very strongly of gasoline.  It is so strong I could not leave them in the house.  I cut this part off of one of the straps to see if that was really the problem.  This reduced the smell significantly but the smell was is still apparent and I don't want something that clearly contains a nasty solvent on my skin.  Too bad, I liked them otherwise."
1.0,"Awful fabric, mostly see-through. Not at all a swimsuit, it looks more like a body suit but even then the fabric still is way too thin.<br />Wouldn't recommend at all.<br />Not returning since is not worth the hassle, but would very much like a refund."
1.0,Bull crap!! Only came with the kimono! The button down shirt that is “pictured” is NOT included!! Terrible! It should state that
1.0,"this isn't what i ordered, i got red and silver earrings instead of black and i don't like them at all"
1.0,"Broke on first day that I wore it.<br /><br />Revised review: Yes this band broke the first day I wore it, however the company reached out to me for a replacement and refund.  Because I actually did like the band I just accepted a new band with no refund needed.<br />Double revised review:  So I received the second band on Friday I wore it to work on Saturday, got home and boom it broke into pieces... ONCE AGAIN!!!<br />So at this point I can just get a refund!!!"
1.0,"As I've said before, spend the $ for the real deal. DY products last a lifetime & can be sold for Orig. price or a profit!"
1.0,I now see it says one piece. It shouldn't show a pair-VERY MISLEADING! Who wants one?
1.0,Tried to set the time and date and the stupid crown stem came out!! Totally fragile. I returned it to a drop off point and got a refund. AVOID
1.0,"pin broke off immediately as I removed it from the package, very upsetting."
1.0,I question whether these are sterling. They look & feel like a flimsy wire bent into a shape.
1.0,Barely have worn it and the gold is rubbing off
1.0,I have size 14 pants that fit perfect but this item does not. I cannot get them on.
1.0,"Loved the colors, but had to return as it was easily 2 sizes larger than other clothes the same size.  The fabric is also fairly heavy and I was looking for a nice summertime lounging outift."
1.0,"Horribly small.  The width is huge but the length is way too small.  The smell of them when I got them was outrageous, I understand new shoes have a smell but these smelled like they had been soaking in gasoline for days.  Even followed the reviews and ordered a larger size and still way too small.  Seller of this item never answers."
1.0,I really wanted to give it a 5stars. But it broke the very first tire I put them on which was quite disappointing. They are cute though.
1.0,"These are way too small. Like two sizes. And whatever you do, don't dry them. Look great in picture tho. I fell for it! Took forever to get here even though I have prime"
1.0,Device will not charge. DOA<br /><br />I took the dead bluetooth parts out and gave the beanie to my girlfriend. She likes it.
1.0,No stretch whatsoever<br />Pure cotton
1.0,"They seem to be well made but they are much too short and don't fit my ears. The hook up top that is supposed to make it stay put is so short, it won't grasp my ear at all. And I don't have weird ears or anything so I don't get it. So sad :("
1.0,"The cardigan looks nothing like the picture, the material is itchy and  it is so thin it's almost see through.  Also the sleeves are quarter length, not long. There are better cardigans at Walmart."
1.0,The clasp doesn't hold. I lost this bracelet because of it. I wore it the night it was received and it seemed OK. The next day within 1/2 hour of placing it on my wrist it fell off and I'm not sure where it fell off. I was not doing any strenuous activity. The band is nice but the clasp will cause you to lose the thing.
1.0,These are literally the worst work pants I’ve ever purchased. I ordered a size bigger than usual after some people saying they run small. They came and they fit but they were pretty snug. I wore them for literally 4 hours and the whole band where the belt goes was starting to already separate from the pants. They’re made terribly and the sizing sucks. So I returned them and got one more size bigger before I give up. They’re still snug but we will see how they hold up today. Pants are kinda short too
1.0,Product has a white chalky substance on mask.  I requested a refund.  This company would not grant a refund.
1.0,"I bought these goggles, because they came as a two pack, at least according to the description, which says ""Aegend 2 Pack Kids Swim Goggles..."". However, I only received one pack. I contacted the seller, but didn't receive a response. My son likes the goggles. I am fairly disappointed."
1.0,"The mask was supposed to be used as protection against the covid 19 virus, but it is way too small to be of any possible use. If it fitted over the tip of my nose the bottom came just below my mouth and with the slightest  movement it would slide into my mouth. If it fitted below my chin it wouldn't fit over my nose.<br />I have to add that my head and face do not belong to somebody who is disproportionate.<br />I am awaiting a reply from the company about returning the masks for a refund as promised."
1.0,The dress was falling apart upon arrival.  Not sure that it was actually sewn in some places.
1.0,"It looks nothing like the picture, the color is more of a  cream yellow, the material is very thin and cheap looking, it is wayyy to big so it has no shape to it."
1.0,Junk Fell apart - you get what you pay for
1.0,The dress is not sweater material it is cotton t shirt material and the length is so short. Not even dress length more like a tunic top
1.0,"We expected it to be big, but it’s WAY to big. That’s not even the issue, all over the dress has this excess material that very clearly should not be there. Will be returning"
1.0,Broke before I could even wear it
1.0,Doesn’t look like the picture very heavy and bulky
1.0,"This is barely better than costume jewelry. I do not believe that the metal is steel, because it does not stick to a magnet. The circle surrounding the star is also not completely closed. I was hoping for a sturdy piece of jewelry and I was very disappointed."
1.0,"Says that it's leather. If you count waxy string as leather, I guess. States that it's adjustable. This thing could wrap around my wrist twice.  It's the size of a necklace. I'd give it negative stars, if I could."
1.0,"I like that they wrap around and are dark, however, the lens pop out, even tho you can put them back in they won't stay."
1.0,"Long time ago, but it wasn’t the quality I thought it would be."
1.0,"Yes, the pattern looks like a table cloth, but the material feels like one! It is rough and doesn't flatter my body at all. For reference: 5'6, 140 lbs, 36 C"
1.0,The top has absolutely not support. It’s a joke.
1.0,"The first thing I noticed about this watch, is how easy water gets in it. I just washed my hands with it on. A week later, it completely fell apart."
1.0,I just got my necklace..Looks nothing like the picture. It look like it was turning black and the silver is fading...
1.0,"This shirt arrived today in time for a Father's Day gift. Unfortunately, the printing is way off center (at least 2 inches) and I will return."
1.0,I used these to change a light bulb and the “ruggedized leather” melted all over the bulb.
1.0,"Unfortunately, this one is “bait and switch” dress that is not what you see in the pictures.  The seller used the stock photos of the dress with the same print but different design.  The actual dress has about half of the fabric of the original dress.  The skirt is not full and flowy but very narrow, and the back does not have yoke and lower ruched part but just one piece with no shaping.  It is inferior design intended to save the fabric.  On top of that it is ridiculously small.  I am a fan of these rayon dresses and own many, however, I ordered the same size, received this one unbuttoned and could not even approximate left and right sides to button it.  I wonder what the seller was thinking, that we will not notice the difference?  Back it goes."
1.0,Was sent back
1.0,Adorable dresses and after two washes they fit an American Girl doll - total scam!
1.0,Worst purchase ever! Put it on over black top and leggings and I’m covered in grey fuzz. In public. On a Friday night. Not happy. See pic!
1.0,No where near the right size.  Tag says 3XL and it's a medium at best
1.0,Absurdly small. Very wrinkle prone.
1.0,"Didn't fit which is a shame for how cute it is. I mean, it could have just been my head size but either way I'm disappointed."
1.0,Not enough info on product
1.0,"The medium  was way too large and the small too tight in the shoulders.  I love the style, but they need a size 8, not 10."
1.0,This was supposed to be a youth  (kids) small but it is the size of an adult small. Very disappointed my son needed this for Thursday.
1.0,It too short and the waist rolls up
1.0,They are difficult to apply and do not lay smoothly on the nail.
1.0,Very thin canvas(see through) and the flowers are not white. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Unless you have the hands of an 10 year old these won’t work out for you.
1.0,"Ordered bronze, got silver, did not receive any item that is pictured, very small, none of these are useful for what I wanted."
1.0,I ordered a size xxl and fits like a medium. The material can stretch. But it’s still not going to fit. I was hoping it would fit like at least a large. The material is really cheap. This is not worth the money. It looks nothing like the picture. And it’s not as long as it looks in the picture. A little bit more above the knee. About two inches above what the picture of the model shows. I like my dresses right at the knee.
1.0,Necklace came out of the box with a pearl already missing and a link was broken.
1.0,Didn't look anything like the picture.
1.0,It broke within 1 minute
1.0,I am extremely disappointed!  Twelve (12) of the forty finger lights do not work.  The lights were tossed loosely into a vinyl bag rather than in the box pictured on site.  I had hoped to distribute these as part of gift bags at a children's party.  Now I don't even have enough to get the job done. Worthless!  The price was right.  Too bad the product was so very wrong!
1.0,If this item had not arrived damaged it would have probably been very nice.  The details and coloring were on point. The handle was sturdy.
1.0,Way too small. Would fit a child but not really.  It literally has a string to tie. No elastic or better way to tie. Not able to wear it easily. Difficult to put it on and even more difficult to keep it on. I simply could not wear it.
1.0,They were too small she needs a bigger size. I'm sending them back. Nice looking shoes the wings perfectly. They are the best looking wings.
1.0,Going to return thought were ski gloves.
1.0,I ordered a 2x and got xs. Had to return. Ordered again 2x and it was too small and had to return it.
1.0,Insanely wide tie
1.0,"They broke within one day of ordering them, very flimsy. Went to SAMs Club and bought a pair with a warranty.."
1.0,this is nothing like the photo! I want to return it but the seller didn't get back to me and its been a month since. It was too big and not pretty like the photo! DON'T BUY
1.0,"The material was cheap, threads were sticking out from all angles. The black stitching was so uneven. Was going to gift or keep. I’m thinking I might just throw them away."
1.0,Garbage. Didn't fit my son's head. He's 12. Fit my head. For 5 minutes then rolled off. Junk. Can't even return apparently.
1.0,It gold washed off. Ghetto
1.0,"I will no longer wear these.  After replacing the insoles and washing the shoes 4 times, they still smell of a chemical factory.  I would worry about even having this remotely close to my skin, even with socks.  I was excited about them and they are comfortable, but the smell permeates the room.  Even my wife dropped the ""smelly feet"" jokes."
1.0,Broke same day we received them.
1.0,Both items were damaged. The package was ripped and the necklace came in three pieces. So cheap! Not worth purchasing.
1.0,"Most of low rating due to item suggested as often bought together with the behind the neck soundtrap s6.  Shown with the soundtrap s6 (behind the neck type) on the page same page as often bought together.  They are not compatible!!<br /> You can twist the soundtrap and squeeze in, but it will mess up the ear muffs. I also had another brand that fit over the head the the case worked fine on."
1.0,"I am wholly unimpressed with this item. The material itself - though leather-like - is quite flimsy. There were long strings hanging out and clogging up the zipper. The item touts that it has built in eyeglass cleaners but in reality this &#34;extra&#34; material just hangs out all over the place getting stuck in the zipper and cluttering up the inside area. (I cut it out of there, folded it and put it in the bottom of the case - it's still not a great fit, but did allow the zipper to work better and the glasses to fit better.) The zippers (both of them) are incredibly cheap and the teeth continually fall of the track - almost daily I had to work these zippers back into place in order to zip this case shut. The item is designed to attach to my belt - and within 2 months, the loops where it attaches have frayed and one has broken rendering this item useless. Bottom line is: this is a $40 item - it should be marked at $5 and even at that price, I still wouldn't buy it again."
1.0,This was a real disappointment. The dress in the picture is not the dress I got. The fabric is thin and drapes poorly but it is a beautiful print. The dress is made with as little fabric as they could get away with so the skirt is not full as pictured. Unless you are pencil thin and want a dress that will likely rip easily skip this dress
1.0,I bought a size larger for my aunt and mom and neither fit they were way to fit. No give or stretch to them. We bought for plus size women so not sure why they would not have any give or stretch to them...
1.0,.Listed and labeled as XXL but I couldn't even get my arms into it. Was maybe a large at best
1.0,"The product had a bad smell, bad fit. Cheaply made and just hung on me. The inside lining was too short for the dress. Not happy at all with the quality."
1.0,Really bad quality. Very thin and not very flattering when worn.
1.0,Terrible detail!
1.0,Man im so pissed
1.0,Received and was extremely upset. I ordered the largest size avaliable and when I opened it and went to try it on and it fit like a small. Not impressed
1.0,"The socks are amazing in terms of how they fit and they eliminated my ankles swelling in the morning after wearing them to bed! But the all-too familiar smell (kerosene or some chemical) of products from China was so strong even after two washings, I decided to throw them out. I didn't want to expose my body to whatever chemicals  they used to manufacture them! I shopped for compression socks made in America and ordered those."
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture. I'm 5'7, weight 112. Ordered a size small after reading reviews thinking that my normal size would fit me. My butt cheeks hung out BEFORE I tried to bend over."
1.0,The right shoe zipper broke the first day I wore them out. Other than that the shoes were cute up until then. Buy these if you don’t plan on walking in them. Cheap is cheap for a reason sometimes.
1.0,Super cute design but started to smell and turned my finer green.
1.0,I have a pretty average size head but this hat is really big and awkward looking .
1.0,"I use the mission gaitor for work but at $20 a piece for the tan color, Wanted to try a lower cost option! Material is comfortable but the ends are just cut and not finished! No stiching! A waste of $, I dont evan plan on wearing it."
1.0,"As soon as I opened the hook part of earring the red stone fell out . Tried to glue, did not hold. Through in garbage."
1.0,Loved the watch until the second day when the second hand started flopping around with any wrist movement. Would buy again if I had confidence would not happen again. Great looking watch.
1.0,"This top was poorly made, ill-fitting and made of cheap material......"
1.0,"The item arrived, it was broken in 5 different sections of the headband and the material is the worst! Super thin, had a small hole in it looked like it was used, just terrible! Not even worth the effort to return it!"
1.0,Junk<br />Something we buy at 99cents stores
1.0,The cover did not fit my Apple Watch 6. The buttons on the side would not work at all.
1.0,"The edges are tan-ish instead of white...the red isn't brilliant like the amazon post picture. I didn't pay much, I shouldn't have expected much, but I was disappointed. I bought it to add to a birthday gift for my niece who is creative.  I won't be giving it to her.  It's very dull and uninspiring.  I don't like writing negative reviews, but it is what it is."
1.0,"Empty box, no product in it."
1.0,I read the reviews before I purchased. But I figured  that if I order a size 3 times my normal SURELY it should at least fit; WRONG. Even that size fit like an petite junior. Come on ! How about a little quality control here. I know everything's made in China but we're not made in China.  I returned it IMMEDIATELY.
1.0,I’d give it a no stars. Size medium and it’s more like a petite extra small. The arms especially are so narrow it wouldn’t fit a seven-year-old.
1.0,5 charms came broken and my daughter was going to salvage but as soon as she put one charm in her croc it broke right off. So disappointed because the designs are really cute ☹️
1.0,"I have to have clear retainers for work, these were some of the ones I tried. The end caps don't show up-- great job there-- but the stud portion is next to impossible to get in and it's even more impossible to get the end piece in. Overall it took me an hour and a pair of tweezers and a pair of jewelry pliers to get these in and decent. And the end pieces get lost/misplaced quite frequently.<br />Major thumbs down, overall."
1.0,"The earrings were thin, brittle and arrived broken. They were inexpensive and not worth my time to return ."
1.0,"I am not a thin woman, but these pants seem built for someone with huge legs and calves. Not true to size at all. I ordered L and should have ordered S."
1.0,Broke after first tug. Needs a different clasp
1.0,"Bought the bag one week, took it to Cancun the next week and the stitching at the top tore apart.  Pretty bag, but not a good buy."
1.0,This wouldn’t fit around my neck which is a normal size. Too sad and returned.
1.0,strap broke 2nd time wearing it and adjuster fell off.
1.0,Bad quality the material is not good
1.0,The velcro to secure the wrap was very long and got in the way attaching to everything and the wrap itself was not luxurious in any way.  I returned it.
1.0,Don’t bother. So cheap that the ear wire broke first time trying to insert.
1.0,It worked for two uses! It's really thin so not much keeping you warm and the music did play really really low.
1.0,"Only had the skirt a little over a month and the elastic in the waistband has gone bad.  The waist fit a little big and I wanted it that way, but I hardly got to wear it.  It didn't last as I was hoping a garment from this company would.  I have purchased many items from this company because they are 100% organic cotton and comfortable. A return or exchange would be greatly appreciated!"
1.0,Colors less bright than what is shown her . Very cheap quality. Waste of money
1.0,Cheaply made and out of a thin shiny itchy material.
1.0,Was really upset to receive this product and the bracelet was broken and the clasp did not work.
1.0,Seriously had random words printed on it and was atleast two sizes too small. 🤦🏽‍♀️
1.0,this dress smells of perfume as if it had been worn and it is torn on one sleeve in the front.
1.0,Not great quality but they weren't expensive so I should have known.
1.0,"Don't buy! Comes from China and is poor quality. I'm 5'8&#34; and I knew that it would be shorter on me so I got the large and at best it's a long shirt, but very tight in the bust. If you are tall and have any size cup I suggest not getting it"

1.0,Nice looking watch for the money.  Problem is it did not work.  Dead battery.  Seller replaced the watch in two days.  Problem is IT did not work.  Dead battery.  Replaced the battery.  Watch is working.<br />I'll let it run for a few days before I make the keep/return decision.<br />The overall quality of the watch looks good.  Would not hesitate buying this brand.
1.0,"This shirt dress was not a good buy. The material is thin and scratchy and not flexible. It has awkward length between a dress and a shirt and will need to be worn with leggings or shorts regardless of season. It had many frayed threads and I didn't think it would survive one wash, nonetheless multiple washes. I returned it and I don't recommend it."
1.0,"I’ve bought several over the past couple of years the last two I purchased they have changed the material making the skirt slide up, constantly pulling it down is annoying and embarrassing. The reason for purchase is for modesty, that’s gone!"
1.0,A really pretty shoe BUT the leather is so hard. It hurts your feet when I play squash in them. I use mine for walking now.
1.0,I got this for my husband for fathers day and he loves it...except it came off the keychain as he was trying to put it on his keys.
1.0,These do not stay in place.
1.0,"Wired fit , way to small,  not even close to pictures"
1.0,"Within two -three months of purchase, the entire left side of the right shoe came apart from the sole, leaving the shoe useless.  Very disappointing."
1.0,"I got these so I could stretch to 0g. I waited around 2 months before stretching from 2g to 0g. I cleaned everything and made sure it was good for use. Less than a week later my ear was infected and I had to take them out. I've used stainless steel before and have never had any issues. After closer inspection, the gauges were all scratched and ruined when I got them. Do not buy these."
1.0,"Very poor quality material. Design is flimsy. Took too long to get in, and then had to return it. Don't order"
1.0,Not happy with  The product I wore it twice and it broke.
1.0,"i guess you need long or very big boobs for this. got a XL, i am a medium in US sizes. but china sizes are mad off. any who, the XL bottom portion fit like a glove the top however was soooooooooooo baggy. imma have to martha stewart it if i want to even wear it a mess."
1.0,The cord snapped in a 20mph wind after one week. The bracket held up just fine. Very easy to install but not very sturdy.
1.0,"I either don’t understand how to use these, or they are too small. So right now they are not in use and we’re a waste of money."
1.0,Not to happy nose ring was to big and uncomfortable hopefully seller fix issues I didn’t get the right amount either
1.0,"The first time it was tried on, a seam opened. The fabric is too cheap to repair properly."
1.0,"I use this type of glove when I ride my bike.  I only ride 20 miles, but after 10 miles the cushions on your palm side got totally flat and it felt like I wasn't wearing any gloves at all (which is a bad thing).  I'm glass that I didn't spend much money on them"

1.0,The wrong university hat was delivered same as mentioned by other review.
1.0,Very small in size. Washed exactly as directed. Even small after that. Wasted money! And I bought 2 of them!!!
1.0,Goodr’s lens scratch way too easily. I would not recommend spending the $25-$35 on this brand. There’s better ones out there for around the same price point. The colors are fun and the sunglasses look cool. They just have to fix the scratching issues
1.0,Absolutely horrible. Much smaller than I thought.  The worst thing however was that the bag absolutely stings of smoke!!!! Can't use this bag!
1.0,To big and to rigid
1.0,My grand daughters most wanted gift and a butterfly falls off as she is placing it it on her ear.  We won’t receive the replacement until FEBRUARY
1.0,"Beautiful work, THE ONLY DOWN SIDE YELLOW TURNS WHITE DOESNT LAST TURNS YOUR HAND BLACK"
1.0,Cheap and not great quality.  Don't bother.
1.0,The item arrived damaged-the dish on the bottom was heavily scratched. And one of the branches was broken.  Wondering if I just returned something that had been returned before?
1.0,I will be giving this away or sending back.  Very cheap thin fabric.  WalMart and Big Lots wouldn't even sell this.

1.0,Junk skip this - nice looking but poor build
1.0,Bracelets are so thin they bend with the slightest pressure. Not a practical piece of jewelry
1.0,These did nothing more than make everything turn yellow. Glare was still the same. Going back.
1.0,Way too small for normal male face. Very tight and stiff. Extremely uncomfortable and stuffy. Hard to breath through it. Did not live up to the other higher rated reviews that leaned me towards buying it.
1.0,Cute book bag daughter picked it out for herself but she’s only been in school a week and the strap is coming apart. Poorly made.
1.0,It creeps up toward your waist  as you wear it.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1.0,I totally thought these were PUMA and they said POMA...I was highly disappointed
1.0,Hate it not cute when you buy it.
1.0,Garbage! This ring started turning  a Cooper color after 1 week.
1.0,"Does not stay tight, eventually will loose. Up around your wrist"
1.0,A only gave it a 1 because it cleaned my lenses so I could see what I was missing before the FOG took away my vision.
1.0,"This dress was a total fail! Based on the size chart a 4X should have been the right size however it was NOT EVEN CLOSE, VERY SMALL!<br />First I had received this dress in a 1x by mistake, when I received the dress in a 4x I compared it to to the other dress and I was so angry to see that it was almost exactly the same size as the 1x. I have waisted my time and money having nothing to show for my efforts. It's apparent that you can't trust the size chart and or they are improperly labeling the clothes they ship out. So very angry and disappointed!"
1.0,Too thin to do its job
1.0,Also they stink!
1.0,Will be sending back. Cute top but way too small! Not American sized.
1.0,Much smaller than picture depicts. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Wouldn’t buy it again.
1.0,It was WAY too short.
1.0,"It arrived with a hole the size on a dime in the back! As if termites ate thru it. And I cannot return it because I used a discount code and what im going to get refunded will not cover a new one, so, I'm stuck with a broken dress!"
1.0,Never could used them followed direction and they faded
1.0,Very cheaply made. Very disappointed!
1.0,"I bought this set of suitcases less than 2 months ago and used the mid-sized one for the first time this weekend.<br />When I arrived at my destination, the suitcase is coming apart at the seams - literally<br />Do not buy this product"
1.0,"Crease folds cannot get out, small, dollar store comparison. Also the gold plate with the name brand is upside down. Trash, dont buy it."
1.0,Very thin n cheaply made for the price. Fabric is coming off on inside. Not sure it's a real NF.
1.0,Not flattering. Looks child like. don't waste your money unless you are tall and skinny.
1.0,This broke before I even got to wear it!
1.0,Bought a bunch of inexpensive belly rings for my wife so she could swap them out with different outfits.  Big mistake!  You get what you pay for.  This dangle broke within hours.  Disappointing!
1.0,No instructions on how to install filter. Pictures on Amazon look like 2 piece filter locks together. This is a 1 pice gilter and it will not snap shut with fabric sandwiched.
1.0,"The website description said this would fit up to 19 inches. That is absolutely not accurate. I specifically bought this style for this reason and it did not live up to expectations. Obviously I can't return it, so I basically just threw away money."
1.0,"not the material I thought It was, DONT WEAR UNDERWEAR with these, unless its a thong. Every line shows."
1.0,"For 39.00 you would think the entire costume would be included,but instead only a jacket and glove was included"
1.0,I was very excited to get this shirt. The fit was great. I was very disappointed to find a very large while near the crease of the left arm when I put it on. It was as if the arm portion and torso portion that were supposed to be sowed together were forgotten. I wanted to buy more but worried I would get the same problem. Quality doesn't seem to be a priority.
1.0,"I'm 4'11 high ,weight 144lbs.,36D bust, I like the dress very much, I need someone can help me,do you thhing that the size Large we fit me okay. Thank,  Lydia"
1.0,Not the same dress as shown. Totally different design!
1.0,Did not like product. It came to me already tarnished in a couple different spots.
1.0,"I bought 40 denier pantyhose before and those look like 15 denier. There is nowhere on the package saying it’s 40 denier pantyhose, except the sticker on the right corner. I specifically got 40 danier because they supposed to be thicker and more durable. I also didn’t like the quality, it’s only for one wear. It looks like a gentle touch will leave marks (which might lead to leading later). Would not recommend!"
1.0,Didn't like that the material showed wear right away .
1.0,"Wouldn't recommend. Cheap material, not a good quality item... the size adjustment in the back is elastic and slips back no matter how many times you fit it to your head, the shape of the actual hat I received is also kind of odd, not really suited for use in a human head, tbh. I purchased it last minute for an amusement park trip, and I ended up not even using it because it was too annoying/ill-fitting"
1.0,Pendant  is quite beautiful however chain was broken when I received it so I’ve never actually gotten to wear it. Would barely give a half star due to quality of the chain and lack of helpfulness from the company
1.0,"This hat is made of thin, flimsy material. Honestly don't think it will last 2 months. Paid less for much superior hats."
1.0,"This shirt is really thin and stretchy and shows every flaw you're trying to hide. The rainbow is pixelated and solid orange with a random blue stripe, it is not a rainbow. What brothered me the most is it came in a clear ziplock bag with nothing sealing it. It had no tags or anything. I tried the shirt on and put it back in the packaging as if I never opened it. Anyone could have tried it on and put back in and I would be none the wiser. Amazon apparently is shirking on their packaging now.<br />I ordered a 2x and it fit exactly the way I wanted, big flowy and long enough to wear leggings with. But for $22 it's a cheap shirt and I'm returning it."
1.0,The bar is too short and I would have loved to just switch out the bar BUT the manufacturer crazy glues the bar and one of the gems so there's no way btw I use a 5/8 bar
1.0,"I usually wear a size 6-8.  Because athletic wear sometimes runs small, I ordered a large.  It was VERY tight/small on me.  Unfortunately, because I was out of town during the ""return window"",  I missed the return date.  The seller has been unresponsive to my returning it even a couple days after that date.  Too bad for me..."
1.0,The jacket is super form fitting and the bottom of the jacket was not long enough for my comfort. It is almost considered crop. It hits slightly below the bellybutton about at the hip bone level. I was disappointed.  Considering most shirts now days come much longer than that. So it would look funny unless you wear a skin tight tank top underneath it.
1.0,"I read lots of reviews on this and was so excited when I received it I hadn't even worn it 12 hours and the charm has fallen off. Yes, I know it's not going to be the nicest piece of jewelry but I'm highly disappointed."
1.0,size of a teenager order a large women and it fits my 80lbs 13year old daughter size are bad. nice suite but size extremely off
1.0,I usually wear a medium. I thought this would be roomy but it was too small to wear with leggings.
1.0,tarnished and broke won't very disappointed
1.0,Total misrepresentation of product. This is NOT a sweatshirt. It’s very thin waffle T-shirt material. Very thin and even seethru. Don’t buy it.
1.0,70s appearance. Not much shape to the blouse. Did not accommodate “FREE return”
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1a53af85d5a800eeb61994804a27eff7]]
1.0,Ordered size xl.  Fit wife.
1.0,"Beware, these lenses are bigger than the stock lenses and I had to go to an eyeglass store and pay to have them put in."
1.0,"Sizes do not match US Sizes, I wear XL comfortable however this one fit like it was made for a child and considering how long it took to arrive, I did not opt to send back for a replacement, therefore I have another shirt I really liked that was a dud"
1.0,"When I received the ear rings  a  one ear ring was longer than the other, it looks like somebody did not take time to  do it . I had to return it"
1.0,In person this looks like one of those shirts my grandmother made for my mom in the 60s. It's really bad.

1.0,It was not true to size at all.
1.0,It came with the top band unraveled and half off  the brim 😞
1.0,This Dress is horrible.  The ears left black lint stuck to the whit dots that does not come off.  The dress is so cheap.  I wish I could return it but my daughter has to wear it to a party tomorrow.  DON'T GET THIS DRESS.
1.0,"So disappointed with this purchase. The photo makes it look like it’s good quality, but what arrived was very thin and still, months later has a terrible chemical odor, even after washing! I though I’d hang it and wait it out, but it cannot be hung near anything else, and has not improved."
1.0,It's not anywhere near ad<br />Size a joke. Made  a<br /> 32 A ad says it's 44.
1.0,These are average quality Chinese made polyester and nylon shorts.  Not great for running as they are heavy.  Loose fit so not great for gym. No particular style.  Nothing special for the price charged.  Look elsewhere.
1.0,The worse!!!! A dollar toy is way better than this trash . DO NOT BUY
1.0,"These are not Maxx brand.  My dad has quite a few pairs and loves them. My boyfriend tried them and wanted some, ordered and they came late, unbranded and felt really cheap."
1.0,Pongan las medidas correctas hacen tallas muy pequeñas no toda la gente es delgada yo uso talla L y pedí una talla más y ni así me quedo
1.0,The fabric seems very cheap I brought it to wear to a wedding and it just didn’t seem wedding quality
1.0,Fake Fake Fake
1.0,the print for the flowers is only half there.  The rest is just an outline where they should have been printed but weren’t. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,It was not what we were hoping for.  Looked too bulky.
1.0,Hated it does not like the pictures
1.0,Broke the first time I wore them . Very disappointed!
1.0,"I bought a similar olev automatic watch and it constantly stops.<br />I sent 10+ emails to the company for replacement with no results.<br />No response from customer service, TERRIBLE! BEWARE"
1.0,This didn't actually come.
1.0,Not at all as it appears in the picture. I wouldn't wear this out - it looks way too much like a nightgown.
1.0,"The first time I wore this, I was having a conversation and felt it just fall right off. The chain had detached from the triangle charm and I hadn’t even touched it."
1.0,Zipper broke in less than 3 months.
1.0,Why two? No engraving. Now I have to find someone who can do that! I'm glad I didn't buy the other four!
1.0,The patches on the sleeves looked cheap and sewing was coming out. The material was very different than expected and not very soft. The pockets awkwardly bulged out which you can't tell in the picture but once on it's noticeable.
1.0,cheap stuff.
1.0,"Ordered according to size, medium, dress is HUGE! Very cheap looking dress. Quality is almost feels like a reusable bag. Save yourself from having to pay for the shipping back!"
1.0,"Cheap.. missing multiple gems and runs extremely small, and this is coming from a person who has a very small writs. It fit my 7 year old the way I was expecting it to fit me. I was just very disappointed in the product and the fact that I bought them as gifts for my sisters... would not buy again."
1.0,I thought they were men/women socks. The package says women only. Not cool since they were ordered for a teenage boy for Christmas. Probably the wrong size for him too. Not impressed.
1.0,Very poorly sewed. And the size chart is wrong
1.0,They were too big for what description I put on the search engine and they make my ear very sore if I wear them there.
1.0,Not true to size. Material seems like to have a nylon feeling. Not good quality.<br />Waited too long for delivery to be be disappointed
1.0,Cheap feeling and broke the first night I wore them.
1.0,Top covered nothing if you're B cup or more! Bottoms were super cute
1.0,"Much much too small.  I am guessing this is Asian size. I do not recall seeing that this was Asian sizing when reading the description. I hae purchased items that are described as Asian Sizing, but I accommodate for the difference in sizing. Very disappointing"
1.0,"My wife said the dress was short waisted, there were no labels describing fabric, and no washing instructions.  She pointed out one quality problem with stitching. That's too many complaints."
1.0,The fabric is cheap and the size is way too small.
1.0,My wrist magically hits the lever and unlocks this band and it falls off. Happened probably once a day. Two weeks later the lever falls off of the rubber band. Not the best $7 I ever spent.

1.0,"[[ASIN:B00XUYP72E 60th Birthday Gifts For All 60 Cooking Still Good Looking Funny Apron for Kitchen BBQ Barbecue Cooking Baking Crafting Gardening Two Pocket Apron for Women and Men Heliconia]]<br />The one star is for this item arriving in time to give someone for a 60th birthday gift. However, I was disappointed in the quality for the price. The apron seemed small compared to similar aprons. The fabric was thin and the stitching puckered. The lettering was not only off-center, but not level! Seems like it would be easy to find the middle and make sure one side wasn't lower than other -- very sloppy. If I hadn't needed a gift right away, I would have returned this immediately."
1.0,I would give it 0 stars if I could. Looks much prettier online. My daughter wore this necklace for about an hour before it broke. Very disappointed as she was very happy to receive it as a birthday gift. Very poorly made.

1.0,way too big of a gauge and made my nose piercing really sore

1.0,"It broke way to easy, super cheap."

1.0,Not at all the quality I expected.  Looked very cheap and didn’t look like sweater that was pictured.
1.0,"Received this hat for my birthday, and although it looks cute, I can’t wear it due to the noxious smell.  I have washed it twice, and hung it outside for 48 hours and there is no appreciable reduction to the smell - a combination of chemicals and mildew.  So inexpensive it’s not worth paying postage to return, I’ll just have to write this one off."
1.0,"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED, THIS PRODUCT ARE NOT THE HIGH SOCKS AT ALL, THEY ARE SHORT ONES. :("
1.0,Sleeves are big issue and it’s not matching the pictures and be aware I ordered February 6th and just received it and the company has very poor customer service
1.0,"You can loosen it up but it hurts because it is wrapped around you. The rubber is uncomfortable and plus it wasn't that low, about an inch or two below my normal bra strap area. I would not suggest this product to anyone. I ended up getting the silicon stick on boob cups and I LOVED them They were amazing. you can buy them at Walmart, Victoria Secret or Kohl's."
1.0,Zipper broke after about 1 week.  Product is quite fragile.
1.0,"Very thin, nothing like a n95 or kn95.  Not much better than accordion surgical masks."

1.0,Expensive and the quality is not good
1.0,"After about a month or so of light use, I noticed the interior has broken and now I have a large hole in my purse and everything falls underneath where it can’t be found. This means the interior was POORLY SEWN!"
1.0,Nice pair of gloves for a lady but Amazon has them listed as men’s gloves . I needed men’s gloves

1.0,A little difficult to lock back
1.0,I only wear my gloves for a  few hours and they started coming apart at the seams...

1.0,I liked the style and print.

1.0,Mal diseñadas
1.0,"Very disappointed in this robe, I bought the correct size according to the size chart and it fit way to small, the item is poorly made and was not worth the price I paid for it."
1.0,"First time I ordered it in gray I sent it back because I thought they sent their purple bag on accident, then the replacement arrived and it’s the same color. The picture is clearly a gray bag, wish I read the reviews in detail first because it is ugly. Now I’m having to return two bags. I like the size, maybe I should get the black one?"
1.0,The connecting straps that go around your ears just do not hold up
1.0,These were supposed to be clip-ons and they were pierced studs. I will be returning them. Two of the pair's that I ordered we're like this.
1.0,For some reason I thought the little peas/peanuts were going to be squishy... They are an annoyingly hard plastic in actuality that was disappointing enough. They also break pretty easy and I think one of my pea pods actually came broken.<br /><br />Overall not a very satisfying fidget toy. Would be a thousand percent better if the peas were squishy and not hard plastic

1.0,"One earring was unable to get unlatched- so it was unwearable. The other earring in the pair was able to get unlatched, but was defective because it wasn’t able to close once I got it in my ear. The post size hurt my ear too. I’ll be returning these. I’m very disappointed"
1.0,Doesn’t look like T. It stays flipped over
1.0,"This anklet it cute, but it is low quality. The first day I wore it the chain portion broke off. I am very disappointed with this product. I love wearing anklets and was excited when my order came in, but was not impressed. I have many anklets and have never had one that broke within  the first day of wearing it. I do not recommend purchasing this."
1.0,"Cheap, cheap cheap"
1.0,Love the earrings for beauty but the chain is too thick to push through earlobes if you don’t have bigger holes they do not work I wish they
1.0,"The top hardly has any elastic on the bottom so it seems as though if you raised your arms, you would pop out of it. The bottoms were too small."
1.0,"They were the same as pictured, but look WAY worse in person! The bottom Frey’s is only a cut with scissors! A few washes and they look even worse then the start! Save your money! It’s not worth it!"
1.0,"While this is a beautiful necklace, it is complete junk. We ordered one for our daughter and it was so pretty that we ordered another one for me. It's gorgeous! However, both of the chains broke almost immediately. We thought we would be able to just put the amethyst pendant on another chain, but it is impossible since the opening at the top of the pendant is very tiny. BUYER BEWARE!"
1.0,If you order this you will need to size UP. I ordered true to size (XL) and I could barely fit my breast into one bra part. Everything hangs out unpleasantly which sucks because it’s such a cute styled swim suit.
1.0,"Bought a size little bigger , got dress in put on dress goes above mid thigh ,does not lay right around bottom dress hem , seems to ride up in back higher than front by 2 inches. My checks almost exposed , thought it was me had a friend try dress on same exact thing on her ."
1.0,"These were such a disappointment. I'm a 22/24 and after reading the other reviews, I decided to order the 5XL (I'm normally a 3XL). They were so extremely unflattering. The back pockets sat on the back of my thighs instead of my rear. They were made VERY VERY small....I ordered 2 sizes bigger than usual and they were still a tight fit. Zipper was super cheap as was the button. The entire pair of jeans was made incredibly cheaply. I had such high hopes for these and they were a total let down."
1.0,Too small. Made for toddlers. Idk I just wasn't impressed. Waste of time and money.
1.0,The clasp was poorly made and it wouldn’t open after we closed it. We had to cut it off of the baby. He also had a rash around his neck from it. Make sure to wash before use!
1.0,The material was bad. It was the right size but it just doesn’t look as good as did in the picture.
1.0,el estilo de la  playera no fue lo que esperaba el material es muy diferente a como se ve aqui!
1.0,Wear sparingly!
1.0,This leotard was too thin for use. We were very disappointed.
1.0,The worst material I have ever felt. So itchy. Also was sent with out the belt to tie the dress.
1.0,I used this product about 5 times and the piece where the cord connects in the vest started shorting out and would not turn on . I bought 2 of these vests at the same time and neither are currently working .
1.0,Sent a totally different item than what is pictured. Completely misleading and now the burden to return it is on me.
1.0,Very awkward looking..
1.0,Dislike<br />Disappointed
1.0,It was extremely disappointing to receive this item and find that it is nothing like the picture of what I ordered. The picture clearly shows black writing that only says “pink ladies” on the front and instead this jacket says “the pink satin ladies” on the front and the back of the jacket which also includes pink rhinestones. It is a clear misrepresentation of what I thought I was buying and obviously cannot be worn as a Grease costume as it looks like a cheap knockoff
1.0,I bought the package recevied a Starbucks plastic cup!
1.0,Total piece of crap. The cover for the charging port won't close once opened and has perforated holes for the speaker. That means any moisture goes into the case. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY
1.0,It is labeled 100% cotton. It is not. I tested a small piece of extra material and it is not cotton. 100% plastic. I was going to return it but it is not worth my time.
1.0,Poor quality. I returned
1.0,I ordered this in black and got navy blue.  I ordered 3xl and got something too tight.
1.0,Looked like a parachute. Not like the pic at all.
1.0,It borked twice<br />I gave it to mother in law it broked twice<br />My advice not to but<br />Looks cheap
1.0,These thong sandals are way to wide for my feet and offer no side support!  I bought them because they were suppose to be good for back and leg pain.  Wrong!!! After wearing them to the grocery store I could hardly walk.  Made my back pain worse. Definitely not worth the money!!
1.0,Not an off the shoulder shirt at all. Its terrible and I woud not recomend.
1.0,"The one band that was sent in the correct size worked fine. I like the simplicity of being able to slide the bands off and on. However, I workout and sweat a lot, so the bands don't last long... They stretch out too much and the watch no longer stays in place, causing it to pause workouts. If you just want a cute band, its fine, but its not great for functionality. AND I had to give the wrong sized band away to a friend with a bigger wrist."
1.0,If you like Shine clothes then you may like this. If you don't like Shine clothes then you will not like this dress. I returned all their clothes. I didn't like the material quality.
1.0,These did not fit anyone in my family and really needed them for a 9 year old beginner skateboarder. These didn't even fit me (the small-framed mother). They are cheaply made as well.
1.0,The size ran very very small.<br />I can't wear.
1.0,Broke the same day. Cheap.
1.0,This is a miniature letter made of cheap costume jewelry suited for a toddler. Maybe.
1.0,"cheap fabric, tight, way too short. I ordered a L and weigh 125."
1.0,"The sizing is way off. I ordered a large thinking it would fit loosely, but ended up fitting like a small-medium."
1.0,This necklace kinda sucked. It looks much better online than in person. It continuously kinked. Item turned.
1.0,I was excited about this outfit but the ruffle in the front is oddly bunched and looks a bit odd. She loved it though but tore it within the first half an hour of wearing it. The seams are not well sewn. So disappointed.
1.0,Broke as soon as I put it on so cheap but I gave it one star because they r pretty just very very bad quality will never buy from this company again
1.0,I thought the jacket was thin and it had no weight to it. I know that it was a raincoat but to me it just looked and felt cheap.
1.0,Not true to size. Order 1 size up.
1.0,Wrong shirt was delivered
1.0,"I'm never sure which is the front or the back being that it's a weird cut and there's no tag.  The material is very breathable, but not what I expected."
1.0,Terrible!! Had a snag all the way across! Company response was terrible and would never buy again from them
1.0,"I bought this identical looking bra in a different brand and loved it so much, I bought all the colors from that brand.  I thought this had to be the same but was very disappointed it definitely is not and this brand fits way to small."
1.0,It is made form wood yes but it’s not solid it’s VERY light like I worried I might break it light which was kind of disappointing because I got it for my kids hogwarts birthday it’s got lovely carvings on it and the color is nice it’s just very light and feels fragile made it hard for me her to run around and have fun with it because she didn’t wanna hurt it
1.0,I'm 5'2 181lbs I ordered a XL & fits like a L/M & it came damaged 😔 Could be a really cute shirt if it was true to size & not damaged..
1.0,Very poor quality had to return and PAY to ship it back<br />I would not recommend to anyone
1.0,I think it is a cute necklace for a lower elementary school teacher.  Kids love it. I think it would be cuter if it was longer.
1.0,This was really a disappointment.  I have purchased this before about two years ago and it was great.  This one<br />was made very poorly and came with thread and strings attached on the top of the hat.  They were black and I could<br />not cut all of them off without cutting the hat.  The band around the hat looked terrible.  It was sewn on wrong.  I will purchase again and hope the next one is a good one.
1.0,Pour quality and it smelled like plastic and itchy material.  I will never buy it again.
1.0,U get what u pay for. I should have known better.
1.0,Incredibly thin. Completely see through.
1.0,Weird material and very small to size.
1.0,What I disliked about the item was the length of the bracelet. It could barely fit my wrist amd I have small wrist it seems as if it for children. That is all.
1.0,Waiting still.....
1.0,"I am returning this ring!  I could not believe my eyes when I opened the package and this dinky little ring was revealed.  I read the description carefully and it clearly says there is a minimum of 10 carats of stones in this ring.  No way, now how, and I am extremely disappointed.  Misrepresentation is the worse thing you can do on Amazon."
1.0,I had ordered this items before and it was fine.  On a reorder the slippers were too small.
1.0,This shirt was a huge disappointment.  It is very cheap looking.  Looks nothing like the picture.  Will be returning
1.0,To small....can't even get them in my ears. Would not buy them if I was you.
1.0,"In my search for a face mask that I can wear without fogging up my glasses, I found these that were specifically designed for people who wear glasses.  Apparently the added flap feature prevents the glasses from fogging.  However, when I received the package, it contained just ordinary face masks.  No added flap or special design.<br />Not worth returning."
1.0,Do NOT buy! Seriously undersized. Had difficulty getting refund from asian manufacturer; they offered to refund 80% of purchase price and I could keep the product. They suggested I was not used to asian sizing! Contacted Amazon; they were wonderful and obtained a 100% refund weithin 48 hours.
1.0,"I bought this purse a few months ago and was initially very satisfied with it, but the straps on it have just now broke and the pleather outer material is degrading in a disgusting way."
1.0,"Not quite as pictured, the design looks very cheap in person and the suit fits small."
1.0,Arrived broken. Boo. I had high hopes for my $2 necklace
1.0,Didn't receive correct product. Instead of choker I received some cheap water proof phone case bag.
1.0,Either model has the head size of a 6 year old... or the hat sent is smaller than what pictured in ad. Not sure how it was done. Photoshop maybe?<br /><br />Simply know what you will get will be smaller than what is pictured and not worth half of what they are selling it for.
1.0,"Not flattering at all, very thing material."
1.0,Quality was not as expected. Returned it
1.0,It's cheaply made for the price.
1.0,Cheap cotton gloves- don’t work for anything
1.0,If you don’t mind a thick watch
1.0,Very hard to adjust wrist band; so hard in fact I simply put watch in drawer.  Not worth the price sad to say.
1.0,"I bought this swimsuit in a L and an XL. The large fit ok, except it fit as if I have a long torso, which I don’t. It felt like it was pulling down on my shoulders. Otherwise fit true to size in the bottom. I was hoping that if I sized up it might be a little longer, but it fit the exact same as the smaller size in every aspect. I debated still keeping it, but I realized that the fabric was see through. If I had known that, I would have never ordered the different size. Disappointed because the cap sleeve style and open back were cute!"
1.0,"I ordered a small, it’s more like a large!"
1.0,"It's made / shipped from china.  Oh, the irony of buying something from the same place that caused us to need it in the first place."
1.0,very cute but all mine broke in less than week. very cheaply made and change color very fast. wish i can return. WASTE OF MONEY
1.0,Material on the backside is totally see through. It's like walking around in pantyhose material
1.0,"Same as the rest of the reviews - cheap quality, didn’t get what I ordered, prints are similar to pictures but also pretty far off and took forever bc they are made in China so take that as you will. If I had known this is what I’d be getting after all this time then I never would have ordered it in the first place...might be good to start a fire in the backyard though! Maybe try sending people what they ordered, doesn’t seem like a earth shattering concept."
1.0,Received these sunglasses quickly. I did not like them at all. Bought matte black like one of the reviewers suggested so it wouldn't look cheap. I showed my daughter with them on said it looked like the 3D glasses from the movie. Will be returning.
1.0,"The Skulls are hot glued to the posts.  Meaning the posts are too high, causing the lower portion of the link (the cross bones) to catch on things.  The second day I wore them one of the skulls popped off the post to reveal they are hot glued together.  In an attempt to reattached the skull to the post the same frustrating process continued. The one link would remain in tack for a day and ultimately when putting my suit jacket on the post and skull would separate.  Spend a bit more money and get a solid metal quality product!!!"
1.0,"My daughter ordered a 2X thinking it would be a little big. It was too small!! Not true to size at all! Possibly we were the only ones to have this happen, however, I highly doubt it. Very very disappointed as this was a gift and she was waiting for it."
1.0,Prior to ordering I read all the reviews and I thought I can deal with the problem listed - seemed that everyone is concerned how breakable the earrings are.. Well... I had different problem. The item came on time - looks good.. It will be better if it is useful. I received 2 right earrings... Too bad I cannot use them. Or if someone has 2 left ones we can pair up. :/
1.0,"Wasn't what I expected, poor quality."
1.0,"No, I didn’t like the product, was hard to Insert money into the open and damaged the bills"
1.0,Looks like ladies t-shirt. Very disappointed
1.0,Was too big and not quiet as pictured. Not flattering at all. Ordered xs and it got like a medium. Returned as I would never wear it.
1.0,they are HUGE.  the shorts themselves are good - just huge
1.0,"The measurements were not accurate on their sizing chart. It's smaller. I ordered an XL and I can't button it at my waist and I usually wear a L/XL. I also received the incorrect color. I ordered the sapphire blue and received the lighter color. I even compared the item number on the tag and it's clearly lighter. Also, the button (snap) below the breast is spaced way farther apart than the other buttons which is extremely noticable. (See picture)"
1.0,This looks good on picture. You ll look like you re look like you re going to a funeral in this shirt. Too complicated to put together and bad cut
1.0,It’s just a headband
1.0,Cut my finger taking the ring out of the package. Poorly made.
1.0,SO BAD FOR ME
1.0,Sending back. Not great for big boobs.
1.0,It was suppose to be size Large fitted. This was a XL.
1.0,Terrible quality over all.
1.0,"Okay, so these do hold your shoes and your foot.  That's it.  This is where I gave 1 star.<br />Ladies, trust me - they look ridiculous.  Those straps are too shiny and catch peoples eyes.  And they are very tight and uncomfortable.  There are 3 pairs but now they have become the fancy rubber band."
1.0,There’s a wrinkle on both sides again.
1.0,Horrible item!!! Do not buy!!! It took hours to remove and damaged my watch to get it off!!! My husband finally got it off!!! Some scratches to the back of my watch though!!!
1.0,"does not fit on my toes which i wanted, using them as rings instead."
1.0,I’m not shaped like a refrigerator. Went into the trash
1.0,"very very bad material quality, wastage of time n money,"
1.0,"I don't know what the people in the other reviews got that I saw, but what I received would better suit as a slip if anything. Completely see-through and extremely thin. Poor fabric and quality all around!<br />Would not recommend"
1.0,lovely fabric and color but size of skirt does not appear to be size ordered.
1.0,"I have a lot of hips and butt, and when I put these on, the back was down so low that I would moon people anytime I stand up. The material felt thin and sort of paper-like to me, so it’s not very comfortable. These shorts need to have more space in the hips and butt for the curvy women, especially since they have a curvy woman modeling the outfit. I was able to return it quickly for a full refund."
1.0,2 out of 5 have a big hole in them. Very disappointed
1.0,No hole for button
1.0,"I ordered size 1 and got 31, so obviously its too small. If they are using EU conversion then it should have been 32. Overall they are colorful, but cheaply made. Cannot comment if they are comfortable or not, because they are 1 size too small.  It also game from China, so took forever to reach us. I am disappointed."
1.0,NO POCKETS.  Pockets are important to most men.  If men's pants or shorts have NO POCKETS the product description should say NO POCKETS.  Men's pants and shorts NEED POCKETS like electronics need batteries - when the item does not have pockets it should say NO POCKETS.
1.0,Was pretty but had a pit on the surface and a small fracture
1.0,It’s a cool concept. It just wasn’t for me. The band was painful to wear and was always loose. It’s not great for sports or lifting. Just not good for the active individual.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:75622c8f15c3a1f2f85b1bb51ae1dbcf]] The shoes are smaller than expected with cuts in them.
1.0,This was a waste of money literally didn’t do anything different than just using regular soap😂
1.0,This keeps sliding and doesnt stay in place. Don’t even consider this as a substitute for mask. It started dethreading right after one machine wash.. It is made of cheap material.
1.0,"These are shiny BUT it doesn’t matter if u can’t use them! Wanted to put them on my Nike high tops and they wouldn’t even lace all the way up to the top, let alone be able to tie.🙄They are like 7 inches shorter than my Nike laces - waste of $"
1.0,"The dress was navy; however, after the first wash, the fibers have already faded drastically. The garment looks so aged after a single wash."
1.0,"The fabric on these resembles that of a cheaply made middle or highschool spandex dance team pant. Not business appropriate at all, they were immediately returned."
1.0,Not the best material bottom of the blouse ripped like it wasn’t sew well.
1.0,Ugly! Cheap!  Looks like a toy necklace. I thew it away.
1.0,Simple to install. Good value.
1.0,"Like someone else said, you get what you paid for!! It is not embroidered it is a printable vinyl. This one was a gift to my husband. Well the vinyl isnt even centered! I guess my husband just got a trash hat."
1.0,"Really!?? How you sell a raining boots with the smallest pad than the boots ? It came 1 inch smaller!<br />I got those boots like on 3 days and is a raining day, my daughter really needs them and they arrived with the pad cushion really small. She is gonna get blisters if she used it. I’m glad to check them before she even wear.<br />I’m gonna return right now. Very disappointed"
1.0,"too small , the picture makes them look bigger than they really are. sent them back."
1.0,Broke when placing on head. I'm not heavy handed.
1.0,"Broke after 1 month, too late to return. The handle just fell off"
1.0,The torso is too short. Sleeves are SUPER itchy and puffy.. the torso part is thin and cheap. Very see-threw.
1.0,Hat arrived completely bent to the point that it's unwearable. Don't waste your money.
1.0,These glasses are not nearly big enough to fit over prescription sunglasses.
1.0,"This piece would of been perfect for my jewelry display at craft fairs except the shorter pegs were different sizes. I couldn't believe it. The lowest tier had two different height poles, so when you screwed them in, it was lopsided. I tried to screw one in further than the other but there is just to much of a length difference. I took it to hardware store thinking they can just cut it down evenly for me, but the guy said he couldn't put the threading back in after its cut because it's a factory threading, and he doesn't have the machines. So dissapointed because I bought this months ago and just recently tried to use. So to late for me to send it back. What a waste, and what happened to quality control to make sure these things fit. I'm still going to contact them and see what they say. I'll repost if anything changes. Soo dissapointed!"
1.0,This item fits terrible I ordered a size up and it’s stil too small
1.0,"I bought the D CUP, was too small. Also, the scalloped edges didn’t stick.  Disappointing all around."
1.0,It was way too short
1.0,"Ordered 5x. Looks more like a medium.  Material is cheap, fuzzies flying everywhere. Return process is ridiculous. I didn't realize it wasn't a Prime order. Very disappointing. My niece picked it out for her Christmas present. We even ordered 3 sizes too big because of smaller cuts with Chinese manufacturers. Sucks big time."
1.0,I was excited to get this and really liked it but it broke in less than a week. Looks thick and sturdy but it is not and breaks very easily! Very disappointed
1.0,It does not work at all.  Keeps leaving your boobs out!
1.0,"Poor quality and was nowhere near as pretty as the picture shows. It was not flowy at all and the material was very thin. Even though I sized up one, it was still shorter than expected."
1.0,The product size on the listing is not the same as on the packaging. They are unwearable.
1.0,Not a huge fan. Hard to explain but I have a couple other cat eye frames that I love but the plastic on these frames look odd. It's almost like the plastic too thick or something...
1.0,I order that North Face hat shown above...but sadly I recieved something wayyyy different. Again a very dissatisfied customer!!!!
1.0,Low quality. Embarrassed to wear it. expected more from lucky brand.  shame on you. The picture looks like soft leather but it.s not.  Next time I.ll read reviews but I won.t buy Lucky Brand anymore.
1.0,"Straight back into the bag and back to the seller.  I am 5'7&#34; 180lbs (so curvy/chubby) and normally wear an XL at this weight....  even though i measured myself and used their item-specific sizing chart in the listing (not the amazon default one) to base my order off of, the XL was huge.<br /><br />The quality was poor and reminded me of a halloween costume.  The layer over the chest that looks super cute in the photo is weird foamy fabric.  Don't even want to try it in a smaller size.<br /><br />But God bless free returns."
1.0,"Very disappointed! Top looks like it is made with sequins - IT IS NOT! It is an iron on sticker type of design. Cheap, tacky."
1.0,"Cute print but, it's that polyester dance recital unbreathable costume type of fabric and feels like it won't hold up. Wore it a couple minutes for the full experience and my armpits felt like they couldn't breath. This would be good for a Halloween or themed party maybe festival but again, fabric isn't idea. Not worth it in my opinion. [orange red yellow yantra type tight dress]"
1.0,Could not get rid of the horrible odor coming from the material used. Eventually put in trash.
1.0,"This is not ideal for purses that are the high quality thick leather like coach, d&b or even Michael Kors. The buckles that are meant to hold the purse up are not made for thick straps. Mine broke within a week. I use the remaining buckles to hold up thin waist belts or other thin accessories. I am disappointed and still looking for a purse organizer."
1.0,bad quality resell it from china
1.0,Poor construction!
1.0,"The silver snaps to the watch pops off repeatedly, I have lost my watch on airfield at night, was not cool trying to find it. The NATO strap itself is great but those terrible silver snap ruins the overall function of the band which is to keep it on your wrist..."
1.0,"This was bought for a gift, and after using it twice it broke and didn't work.  The prong that goes into the belt loop became unattached from the buckle.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this for anyone."
1.0,This was very cheap material and looked terrible on. It puts 20 lbs on you. It's not a good fit. I'm tall and slim and this just looked like a giant balloon plus it was itchy. Returned immediately.
1.0,"I thought I was getting 10 pieces but only got 5. I tried it with my different cloth face masks, some made and some bought. It's a little sticky against my face where it rests, but it definitely helps keep the shape of the mask off my nose and mouth which is good when I'm exercising. I think it allows more air to escape around the sides of my face masks--my glasses fog up more. I have an Asian face so my nose isn't as high as the bridge on this mask. I think it just doesn't fit my face shape well, and I might need to add cloth around the parts that rest around my face to make it more comfortable or otherwise figure out how to incorporate it into the reusable face masks I have. It might work better with disposable surgical masks."
1.0,"the two prongs of the clip on are crocked, returned it. It's too bad because I really like the design."
1.0,"These slippers looked and felt so cheap, that I returned them.  I loved the color, but the padding was very thin, and I didn't think the shoe would endure even a summer season."
1.0,Sloppy made.
1.0,"The glasses may look nice but the quality is as bad as it only gets, after less then one year the polarized cover on lens started to go away."
1.0,I wear a 16 and ordered an XL. This shirt makes. Me look like a sausage. It is cut straight not on a-line. Not for maure bodies with curves
1.0,Not a fan of the material. Not true to size.
1.0,"Cheap material, was not a nice thickness/quality like the picture showed. The tassels looked really bad. The button was sewed almost on the back of the shoulder so you could not button the thing without it choking you. Overall a horrible buy.  Returned it right away. Don’t waste your time."
1.0,These did not work n I purchased them as gifts. Very disappointed
1.0,Wrong color! Now too late to get another to replace it :( I even paid extra so I could have the color of my choosing. Very disappointing
1.0,Very poor quality. Very large for a small. Doesn't look like the picture at all
1.0,I really wanted to love this but it broke immediately. The choker necklace broke before I could put it on and the heart necklace broke when I took it off. So disappointed but can't expect much from $6 jewelry I guess.
1.0,Seemed to me like these are plastic.
1.0,"It's literally 100% cotton, no stretch to it."
1.0,This was way too big I picked a 3x but that's more like a u.s. 3x but it said Asian it just doesn't fit right and looks really weird with the double pocket the material is great just the design of the shirt is not flattering
1.0,Looks fake!
1.0,Saludos.<br />Estoy muy disgustado con mi compra. Ya que pedí un reloj que dice que es automático y no lo es .perdí mi tiempo y dinero en un producto que no es lo que dicen .mala descripción.
1.0,Cute but very short and oddly shaped very disappointing.
1.0,"I need to return this items , it wasn't real coach my foot are painful"
1.0,the bodice is very bulky and you have to send it to the dry cleaner to press it into shape. I have one in another pattern and it came out nice. this black dress it was not made correctly on side was way bigger. sent it right back
1.0,He. Not impressed
1.0,"Really like this dress and will order another one. Comfortable and loose, but not too loose. Please make it in small pink and white print. Some of the choices are too busy and loud."
1.0,Really disappointed... I love the cut... but very poorly made. I wore it once and the seams on the lower panel separated... I had to leave my luncheon and go home and change. Very embarrassing since it was literally falling apart as I walked.
1.0,Awful! Don’t waste your money. They broke 2nd time using at a competition. Daughter had to swim w/o her goggles.
1.0,"It's cute, but I have problems with one of them, the stone fell. I use only one day. I don't recommend."
1.0,This comment is very deceptive it looks nothing like the picture it was too small spots where they tried to embrace the garment. I would suggest no one ever purchase this item. I got less than I paid for
1.0,cheap band is tearing already. Can't contact seller.
1.0,very poor quality. cheap plastic sunglasses.
1.0,"If there was a “negative” number of stars, that’s how I’d rate. It’s super comfy and cute; however, after ONE wash....looks awful. Fabric pills so bad. Returning!!"
1.0,This dress has a very awkward seam running down the back. The patterned fabric does not match up at the seam. The advertised picture does not show that a seam should even be there. It makes the dress appear to be very cheaply made.
1.0,UPDATE- After washing once and letting air dry the bottom elastic band folds over. I really can’t stand the bra now but I spent money on it and going to use it. Ugh.<br /><br />The cups are really larger than what I wanted- I’m not a full 34c. . The shoulder straps are really thick. It’s not as comfortable as my VS one I’m trying to duplicate. But it’s better than my cheap one that just pushed everything to the middle and made me flat.
1.0,"It was not as long as they state, it was maybe at the most a 34&#34; inseam not by any means a 36&#34; inseam"
1.0,Nightmare return! But if you're sure you will use the dress it is very pretty.
1.0,the material does not breathe so they are not as good for intense work outs.
1.0,I would def size up on this one.  Keep in mind that the skirt does come up right below or above the belly button.<br /><br />It is short too. So if you are not comfortable with a short skirt do not order.
1.0,"First, the Cowboys logo wore off the first week. Then the shoe broke apart. The toe tongue kept pulling off and forcing my son to stumble or fall. He cant wear it anymore. This is disappointing because he loved the Cowboys logo. The $1.00 flip flop at Dollar store was more durable."
1.0,Made in China.  Not recommended for Covid protection!
1.0,BAND WAS BROKEN UPON RECEIPT OF THE WATCH.
1.0,It was awful
1.0,"The color is nice. Other then that forget it. Fabric is terrible, don't even bother to iron, if you sit it wrinkles immediately! Honestly don't even bother to buy, all around poor quality, returning. And I can honestly say from all I but through Amazon this is my first return!"
1.0,If you want to wear this in the sunlight then they are useless. The sunlight reflects on your eyes from the inside as these glasses do not have an anti-reflective coating from the inside. Maybe you can wear them indoors.
1.0,It came with a broken strap & I returned for a refund
1.0,Fabric feels cheap and is uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,The chest part is super tiny and not for women with more than a b cup
1.0,Made my ear sore bad
1.0,This is not an adult skirt. I bought it for a tutu party and it was way to small seriously it didn't even fit my two year old cousin. It was mad for like a doll
1.0,"The lenses are a thin plastic polymer, not very scratch or impact resistant beyond what you might expect from one of those plastic eggs with the toy inside you get from the 25 cent vending machines.  The frames are not expected to survive long either...<br />Don't accept inferior products on Amazon!  This is $1 manufacturing at best."
1.0,Bought these last year. They were great. Purchased again & they are Absolutely Awful ! Fabric is rough & scratchy on my skin. No stretch. The fabric looks just as cheap as it feels.  They will be returned. Save your money !
1.0,It stinks! Washed it twice and it still has a terrible smell. Would return if I hadn’t washed it 😒 ... don’t waste your time!
1.0,One of the clips were broken and missing a piece when they were opened
1.0,"Cheap,crappy material. If this was a cotton blend it would be adorable. I wish they would stop using this shiny material in clothes,looks cheap."
1.0,Waayyyy too small
1.0,I thought that the coat would be thicker but it was very thin. It was not a true 5x fit. I would not buy again very disappointed I thought that the coat would be thicker but it was very thin. It was not a true 5x fit. I would not buy again very disappointed
1.0,Run very small I recommend ordering 2 sizes larger. But they are comfortable if they are the right size.
1.0,"Wish it were cotton, or a cotton blend. It is all polyester parachute like material. Blah!"
1.0,"The inscription is incorrectly spelled, making it senseless."
1.0,Cheap material. Metal clamps area is very very thin metal. Fit smaller than as size chart. I order up a size and still needed a bigger size. Wasn't happy with material or fit. I returned the corset product
1.0,Tiny!!!! Like for teddy bear :/
1.0,"As many others have indicated, the beige pads show through the top. They can't match the pad color to the color of the top because of poor manufacturing. I purchased a large because others said to size up. The beige pads showed through the top. I purchased a xxl because I thought the pads wouldn't show through if the top wasn't stretched tight. They still show through because of the type of fabric. The top will never be able to be worn alone as they advertise. You get what you pay for."
1.0,Sad. Do not buy. Their Small is actually a Girls 10.  Return window shorter than receiving window….
1.0,Price was too good to be true. Came w no authentic and were crooked.
1.0,Where's the negative connection doe??
1.0,"Aweful fit ! It's shaped weird with seams in front that look uneven ,very disappointed"
1.0,"The arms were too narrow and extremely long, well passed my fingertips!  It is for a skinny gorilla, I think?"
1.0,Order a size up. Was to small
1.0,This is a waste of money. It has last only 1 month. Nothing more to say.
1.0,Terrible neck line.  Would be impossible to wear without a cami underneath.  Not what I wanted nor what I expected.  Good thing it came with free returns!
1.0,not very soft for a baby
1.0,Too Big! Sizes are way off. I received an Entirely different dress. No shape to the dress but what else would you expect from the price.
1.0,Was falling apart right out of the packaging. Also it doesn’t fit right. Other reviews talked about sizing being off but while it was a bit big the bigger problem is that it was an awkward fit- wasn’t right. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,I like the rubber flip flops because they last longer with out your foot breaking them down like the foam these still ended up breaking down after almost a month. But the thing that I really hated about them is I bought the black colored flip flop and my foot was stained for a few days even after a shower. I do not recamend these flip flops at all
1.0,I wore this dress to a wedding and it literally fell apart at the seems within ours. Strings were hanging off the stitches and hole opened in the waist seam (even though the dress was slightly big on me). Anytime I moved I felt like something else was going to fall apart. Now I can’t return it because the wedding was after the return window - a complete waste of money.
1.0,Don’t waste your money. Super cheap material. Snagged so easily. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Gloves are kind of crunchy when the weather is really cold.
1.0,The calf is too tight
1.0,Well packaged and arrived on time. It looked beautiful and I was so excited to wear it. After one use I had to throw it away. The strands keep bursting. I tried repairing it myself but to no avail
1.0,False advertising!! I paid for Sterling Silver not this cheap custom jewelry. Absolutely horrible item....I bought my daughter beautiful silver necklace and I was going to use this heart for a charm.. Not happening its not real silver. Don't spend your money on this fake jewelry.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:3a5b53daca42cdaf405e9b7c55f80dba]] Spend a little more money and get a different material. Durable. U don't want this discolored insult on your neck.
1.0,"The quality of this skirt is poor. Right out of the package and already I see so much issues with it. Threading is coming undone. Right at the waist part of the skirt there's parts where they sewed over a section multiple times so the thread line is not just one clean line but multiple crooked lines. The bow is not like in the picture, perky and alive looking. It reminds me of a limped vegetable that's been neglected for some time. The pattern I selected is as shown, I just wished this was made with care. I guess you get what you paid for huh....."
1.0,"I received this item a few months ago.  When originally worn it worked fine, as a belt should, but yesterday the buckle near the leather part of the belt broke away.  I never knew that this could happen.  The buckle is made of metal and this should not break so easily.  Now, after paying $25.00 and shipping, its in the garbage.  A belt should last longer than 3 months.  A total waste of money.  I cannot return it since then window of return ended."
1.0,"There are not enough holes on the band, which does not allow for a secure and tight fit of the Apple Watch up the skin. This in turn compromises the use of the censor on the watch for tracking activity, calories burned, heart rate, etc. The fit of the band is very poor."
1.0,They dirty up easily and are already tearing apart after 2 months of using them.
1.0,Cheaply made. I didn't even get to wear it because it broke. The findings broke off.
1.0,This dress looked much better online. I didn't like it on me at all and am selling.
1.0,too thin and small
1.0,U can only use this abt 3 times. After this your neck will be green
1.0,description says true to size.  I wear a large so I ordered a large.  The sleeves have elastic so they can puff up but are way too big.  They just hang there. A bit too large at the neck but would be ok if the sleeves werent so big.The blouse hangs down for that reason but the  Material is lovely. I washed it to see if it would shrink and perhaps the sleeves would be smaller but not.  It doesnt shrink. Medium would have fit me but I cant return it because I have washed it.  Bummer.
1.0,"This is a piece of garbage. Do not buy it.  Had it for 2 weeks, it stoped working, and the band is not closing properly. In the package, thye include an email address to get in touch with them. They never responded to my 2 emails sent.<br /><br />Stay away from this cheap brand. Vigoroso brand is a cheap Chinese brand with non existent customer service."
1.0,"Very dark, almost black, no luster, lapis not cut in facets as shown in picture"
1.0,Screws have continously fallen out and I need replacement screws...Are replacement screws available?
1.0,I bought a few XL swimsuits including this one and they all fitted good but this one looked more like a medium. I had to return it :(
1.0,This product did not come with tags on it and is not as soft as the previous sweater I gifted to someone. It smells like perfume and it seems it’s been washed and worn already. Very disappointed in the quality of this product.
1.0,"I wore twice, washed them and the side was split when I removed from the machine.  Garbage got those😭"
1.0,This is just a bracelet nothing more
1.0,Was really excited. Waited forever and the outfit is a teen size!
1.0,material issue
1.0,If you have a DD chest these bras don't fit quite right.  But then it's hard to fit a bra online so I guess techncially I'm the idea who hoped they'd fit.
1.0,Looks like a kids dress.. I sent it back
1.0,Is Zero stars a possibility?! It came damaged and moldy! The whole outfit was waterlogged as well and the dress shirt was speckled with black mildew!  Ever have I been so disappointed
1.0,"It was pretty until the paint wore off.<br />I wear this daily, but never in the shower or during any rough activities. I loved this band for a few months then I started to break out in a rash (I'm allergic to nickel & always buy stainless or sterling silver.) As you can see, it's a coated metal and underneither is a copper colored metal.  Cheaply made, won't last, spend your money somewhere else."
1.0,"I liked the looks of the watch and the band unfortunately the watch was unreadable. Under normal lighting conditions the hands and dial were black, if you positioned the watch at a certain angle you could see it. I am buying a similar watch from a different manufacturer and hope it works out better."
1.0,buyer beware. poor quality. extremely dissatisfied with my purchase
1.0,THE SHIRT IN THE PICTURE IS NOTHING LIKE IT .
1.0,I ordered a Large but it turned out to be super small and won’t zip up.
1.0,"Not at all what I expected. Nothing at all like the picture. The gems are so tiny that it looks a spec of glitter. Very cheaply made. The gems were not straight, they were sideways and looks like they are going to pop out any second. The stick that actually goes through my ears were bent in an acute angle (both sets I ordered btw) and I had to use pliers to straighten them out  which is probably due to the poor packaging (arrived in an envelope). if the earrings were actually put inside of a box then maybe they would have been straight but i guess its a lesson learned not worth returning them so I guess my loss. would never buy from this seller again."
1.0,"I really wanted to love this product. Not only did it not hold a hair tie when I put it on, but I had to continually try to re-fasten the hair tie. The hair tie would not even stay on the bracelet when already on my wrist. This was a horrible investment of my money. So sad and so disappointed! :("
1.0,"One star because Amazon forces you to give one star and they do deserve that for the fun Halloween patterns; however, these are not cotton. If they do have any cotton cottent it is the bare minimum. They feel like a cheap polyester material; the sizing is not consistent; and they are sized for someone with a very large face/head (maybe the Wolfman? IDK). They do not stay up at all and the straps are too long. I cannot recommend these."
1.0,"I've been trying to find a plain black shirt with black buttons for my son.  I thought I finally found one with this brand.  However, when I received the shirt, I noticed the buttons were white (not black as advertised in the photo).  This is very disappointing."
1.0,The pants are too big but the top fits too tight.
1.0,Ordered a size up and it fit perfectly!
1.0,Got this as a gift for sisters to be for new baby and the little sister outfit is the same size as the Big sister even though I got 0-3 months and 5 year old... i decided to get it remade by local shop
1.0,It appears to be made for someone with a LOT of hair. You have to tuck and stuff excess material.
1.0,"Not at all what I anticipated. It is small and flimsy which causes it not to lay properly on the arm. If that wasn't enough it broke the first time I wore it,"
1.0,This belt is not as long as advertised. I was looking for belts for &#34;big men&#34; and this one and another one claimed to fit 48 inches but this belt did not.
1.0,beautiful necklace made of good material
1.0,I bought this just for a concert & received it a few hrs before leaving. Before concert ended the strap came unstitched.  I would not purchase again!!
1.0,Whoever made this product didnt even finish it. One of the worst items i have bought off of amazon...
1.0,"Terrible , looks nothing like the picture"
1.0,It fit fine except the arms were too tight for me.
1.0,"Very disappointed the extra large would not have fit an adult, maybe a young child."
1.0,Your private part is almost exposed . Constantly had to keep pulling it down…
1.0,They didn't work I want my money back!!!
1.0,Was way too small which then I had to return it. If it would've fit I would have kept it because it was absolutely cute.
1.0,Worst buy ever the shirt is large yet I can't fit my hands in the sleeves
1.0,"El artículo que acabo de recibir, me ha llegado con un defecto, le falta uno de los tiros que sirve como ara atarlo en la parte detrás, y sin esto el vestido no se puede usar"
1.0,Garbage.  Wore once and lost 4 stones.
1.0,Cute but hate the buckle probably returning them
1.0,The one I received is nothing like the pictures in the reviews.  It’s not even Honeycat brand.  Really disappointed I payed $18 for it.  It came smashed and it’s already changing colors. Ugh.
1.0,"Ouch ouch ouch. I ordered these in a size up, but they still pinch my heels. I could barely walk across my bedroom in them. They are very cute, but super uncomfortable. They will have to go back."
1.0,"Super thin material, and way too small."
1.0,Makes your face sweat to much
1.0,"Really like the design but the quality is bad! The material of the sweatshirt feels weird. It’s like a polyester and it pills a lot. The pilling is so bad after the first wear and even more after the first wash. The worst part is the design is peeling off everywhere..on the back, on the arms, etc. my daughter is so disappointed in this."
1.0,Cute but  already fading.
1.0,I have had to return this item. missing stones and just poorly made. so sad it was so pretty in the picture.
1.0,"This isn't &#34;too small&#34;.....its NOT EVEN HUMAN SIZE! I wear and 8.5, regular width......couldn't even get my whole foot in this &#34;contraption.<br /><br />The &#34;shoe&#34; looks good, but is it really a shoe if you can't actually fit your foot into it! Nice books ends!"
1.0,Buckle will not release. I am returning item. no replacement.
1.0,Was too small for an adult. Didn't fit me.
1.0,"Totally spelled wrong! It says If Dad can't FLX LT no one can,. It's supposed to say if Dad can't fix it no one can. There's Ls where the i should be and a comma after can not a period. So disappointing seeing it was a Christmas gift and it's 2 days before Christmas!"
1.0,"This dress was see-through and cheaply made. I could clearly see my hand through the fabric. The seams were scratchy and it was saggy around the bust. I've purchased another dress through this company and was so impressed by the quality, which is why I bought this one. This dress was not at all similar in cut or quality. It reminded me of dresses that are made in China and arrive at your house looking/feeling nothing like the picture on the website. Very disappointed!"
1.0,These toe covers are too short. They do not have enough length to stay in place. Within two minutes they were sliding around in my shoes. I returned them.
1.0,Absolute junk. Does not in any way function as a compass.
1.0,I dislike the description on Amazon cause it's not for a smart watch don't get me wrong now I love the look but it's not What I wanted I'm so disappointed waste if my hard working money
1.0,"Received the item in the mail, took it out, put it around my neck and the loop that holds the hook disintegrated and fell off of me!  Terrible, returning."
1.0,Damage  item  hard to get refund.
1.0,the size is off it was not the correct size at all
1.0,Poor quality. The material was not as soft as I thought!
1.0,Poor design.  The plastic flap that slides into the opposite side of the wallet in order to hold the plastic insert in place is too small and flimsy to keep the insert in my wallet.  Useless.  Now I will have to purchase another from someone else.  Crap.
1.0,"My daughter had this shirt on her wish list for Christmas  so I bought it, wrapped it and put it under the tree. To all of our surprise, she opened it and held it up for us to see &#34;CYEAP TRICK &#34; on the back! I made the mistake of not scrolling through the pictures and seeing that is what is on the back. I just don't understand why anyone would want to wear a shirt that says they are a cheap trick. Returning this asap"
1.0,"HORRIBLE QUALITY, EARINGS ARE TARNISHED AFTER FORGETTING TO TAKE THEM OFF IN THE SHOWER JUST 1 TIME. CHEAPLY MADE"
1.0,wore these once and eyes are now severely burned. vacation is now ruined!<br /><br />No UV protection whatever!  DO NOT BUY!!
1.0,I regret this purchase.
1.0,So I wear a size 10 in womens  so I ordered the biggest size 12-13. And they still don’t fit!
1.0,Broke instantly.
1.0,Poor I returned item and they charged me for it anyway
1.0,It's not nice at all
1.0,"UMMMM...besides having a big snag out of the box, it fits like a huge night shirt.  Nothing like the picture.  I ordered a size small and am 5'6&#34; and 115 and it goes to my knees.  I wouldn't buy this top if it was at the dollar store."
1.0,I should’ve ordered a size up because it’s too small. And some of the stitching is coming off the front already!
1.0,Was to big but I thought it mite be but the collar design was strange I couldn't notice the fabrics around the bust and it did not look good
1.0,"Absolutely USELESS.  Bought this watch to wear on my PFD on the river, Immediately after the second use, condensation on this inside of the glass caused the watch to be unable to read."
1.0,Wouldn't buy this dress again. Sending it back.
1.0,The darth vader charm has now fallen off twice and is lost forever. It feel off once and we secured it well and it still fell off again. My daughter was so upset. Not good quality.
1.0,Necklace broke within the first minute of putting it on.  The drop down part fell off.  The color is more rose gold than gold.  Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Paper thin and terrible quality. You get what you pay for!
1.0,Wore it swimming... not at all water resistant. The picture attatched shows the water on the INSIDE of the watch face
1.0,Did not fit well at all. Not as described in the photo.
1.0,Very disappointing!
1.0,I brought it for over six months already. The picture is the same as the actual bracelet that I have received. The butterfly crystals are very shiny and in sky blue color. Love it!
1.0,"Didn’t send correct item. My initial review was rejected, although I used no profanity or error in my description. I wish I could give negative stars now."
1.0,The blouse I recieved looked nothing like the photo.
1.0,Stone fell out on Day 3. Very disappointed
1.0,"Very unhappy with my purchase. I read the reviews and did not see that anyone else had the problem that I do. It took an exceptionally long time to receive my purchase, from purchase to door. I don't mind the wait for something that I purchased, however it is really disappointing to receive what I believe is either two different sleeves, or one new one with a used one. I ordered the solid black, and received one sleeve as such, the other sleeve is noticeably a different shade of black with either a pattern on it ... or what may be stretch marks from a previous wearer?? The latter turns my stomach and the thought of receiving a used arm sleeve disgusts me. Very disappointed and disgusted."
1.0,"Way too big and the soles are really thick, almost like shoes.  Not really socks."
1.0,A complete flush of money down the toilet. I can use these “belts” as shoelaces.
1.0,"a very attractive bracelet, but the clasp does not stay closed."
1.0,I would rate it 0 if possible!  This is awful!  Looks nothing like the listing photo and I bought 4 sizes bigger and still it is NOT a good fit.  Size is WAY small!  Inside is a mess with sewing leftovers and bad bad strings!
1.0,They don’t warn you that you will have to wrap yourself!! 🙄 Literally looking like mummy if you don’t wrap it right 😂🤣
1.0,I bought this for my niece to put her competition leos in and it is falling apart after just 2 weeks. Very disappointed
1.0,Dress was cut incorrectly.  Did not lay right
1.0,The stitching fell apart after the second wash. Super disappointing.
1.0,Ordered the size small but way to big for my ring. Wouldnt fit.
1.0,It's  nice but the color and length are way off.
1.0,Vary bad quality like a plastic bag
1.0,I was super excited when i received this dress and very disappointed when it fit too snug up on top!!! Sizes are way off... will return for a refund!!!
1.0,It looks really cheap quality
1.0,"Yuck!!!! The maroon color is ugly, the lace is ugly, the cut is ugly.  It is soft  I'll give it that- but looks like an old lady dress picked up from the thrift store. Also I wear medium in every dress I order from Amazon, ordered a Medium for this one and it fits like an extra large.  Going back as quick as it came in"
1.0,shrunk after wash and the pants tore.
1.0,The lights don’t work if they do one ear dies and the other won’t
1.0,"The first time I ordered it, shirt was dropped off at some random locker and so I never received it.. I ordered another shirt and ended up returning it item because it was way too big and not what I expected.  Definitely didn't look like picture. I ordered a different one and was happy with it."
1.0,Product is made very small
1.0,This item was mis-represented in the picture....it appeared to be 3 hearts hanging down with one being the urn locket that is what my daughter expected & anticipated we would receive. Instead we received 2 of the same product at 2 different prices.....Very disappointed & upsetting....It was hard enough for my daughter to lose her Dad.
1.0,Different than picture.
1.0,Demasiado pequeña y corta
1.0,RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX DAMAGE. BROUGHT TO WEAR OUT TONIGHT NOT GONNA HAPPEN AWFULLLLL
1.0,Really poor quality. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Had to return.  Arm was way too small.
1.0,Too cheap. I shouldn't have gotten them. Gave them as gifts. They kept falling apart.
1.0,I ordered a XXXL and I couldn't get my arm in this jacket. I am very disappointed.
1.0,Is too small for a high chair and my baby is tiny askinny still not confortable for him and it came damage
1.0,"Loved the earring it's cute sadly I put it on and bow fell of, there were no threads in that side. Returning as much as I liked it not ordering again"
1.0,the fabric is too thin so when you breathe in you basically inhale the mask and there is no place for a filter which would stop that from happening so i will have to modify it so it will work proper
1.0,Very thick material and the color is mustard not yellow
1.0,A lot of material. The dress wouldn’t fit around my waist
1.0,Unfortunately it came broken.
1.0,These are not actually 20 gauge my piercing is a 20 gauge and these did not fit.
1.0,Not happy with this jacket. That jacket i got didnt look like the picture. Washed it it shrunk another size. Hate it.do not order this. Its nit a good jacket
1.0,Don’t purchase them the size is not accurate. I returned it.
1.0,very cheap was a bday present and broke shortly after I bought it for her
1.0,Purchased this a while ago and decided to finally use it. As I started to take the wrapping on the handles I noticed it looks like it was cut. There's no way to get ahold of the seller to exchange it! Felling frustrated I've never had this happen to my other coach purses I've bought!!
1.0,I wish I could give durability less than one star! My daughter wore this for less than an hour before it ripped! I’m VERY disappointed with the lack of quality.
1.0,Size chart was wrong way to big. Arrived 2 weeks late would not refund my money
1.0,Do not buy these shoes they are extremely cheap looking and poorly made. There were actually missing patches where there was supposed to be fleece and you could see the styrofoam. I returned and I never return products.
1.0,"The color and the logo is what I wanted. However, the bill was too large and when my partner tried in on, it was too big for his head and it didn't sit on his head right either. I am disappointed with this hat. It is so hard for me to find a hat that is black with the Seahawk logo on it."
1.0,Definitely not as long as I thought and extremely tight fitting for a medium. Wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,Super thin. I had to order another one two sizes bigger. Super small. I gave the other as a gift.
1.0,"I ordered a small and this dress is more like an XL. It was WAY too big in the underarm area... looked like I was trying to fly away using side-boob flaps. And the hips/thigh areas were too big. The tie waist didn’t help to make it smaller, it just made it look more like a squished potato sack. It’s the opposite of hot girl summer."
1.0,Cheap!! Post snapped when trying to get the earring back off of  the post to put the earrings in the ear.
1.0,I dislike the  ring because I put it on my finger and it tarnished . It isn't 14k gold  .
1.0,The pins bend when you tighten the set screw
1.0,Post was not long enough and it was very loose felt like it was going to fall off.
1.0,TRY CARBON CALI GARMENT SHIELDS:<br /><br />[...]
1.0,I had to return this product because the material sucked (not protective at all) and the image isn’t scaled correctly to the apron.
1.0,Way too big wore it once never again. Shouldve gotten a small. Extra small even
1.0,Really cheap looking and fits awful. The small is massive on me so basically I can only use the jacket or return it. The colors are nice and the stitching seems ok but the fit is ugly.
1.0,"These are beautifully designed necklaces. But they're cheap. I wore the 1 ONE DAY& the gold instantly rubbed off. Look @ the pic for proof!<br />So now, I have to go buy gold spray paint to paint them over so I can wear them cuz I WILL NOT wear a copper necklace!"
1.0,"Looks horrible in person, material is poor."
1.0,"Me gusto mucho pero lamentablemente solo me duro un par de horas , nunca me había durado algo tan poco , ya mejor lo rompí y fue tan fácilmente creo q con un material mejor estuviera estupendo ."
1.0,Loved the look. But the strap connector broke during the 1st trip. Now it's just in the top of the closet.
1.0,Disliked. I wore it once only for the Rodeo.
1.0,Not at all what was described!
1.0,"Like the title says, I ordered the 3-pack of different diameters. I only received 1. And I have no idea what size the one I got is. I know it's too small for my nose though. Which is the exact reason I wanted a pack with multiple sizes. Don't buy from this company. Total ripoff. I'd give zero stars if I could. False advertising is so annoying."
1.0,CHANGED COLOR ONE WEEK AFTER i RECEIVED IT.
1.0,"I've worn my watch for less than 2 weeks and the outer wood band around the face has already cracked and the coating is peeling away in 2 spots. I haven't used or abused the watch in any way. I take it off when I'm at the gym, sleeping, and doing anything physical with my hands. Since I work in an office, there is little chance for it to get damaged through my normal day."
1.0,Its just longer than what I expected....I guess I should have had an idea of length in mind before I ordered it.
1.0,"very cheap material, dont buy it"
1.0,The shirt is very cute but very delicate<br />To be of racer they are not resistant they get threads easily with only touch them with the nails<br />The quality is not good
1.0,"If you mouth-breathe in a mask (which most of us do) you can't breathe in this product because the plastic, of course, has no air flow. And the plastic steams up. Just useless to me and I got claustrophobia quickly."
1.0,These Vista Bike Shorts wear thin in the rear in less than 10 wears.  The high pro cycling name does not match the quality. Believing in the name and that the first purchase problem was maybe a one time quality control issue I purchased a second pair.  The same thing happened in 5 wears.
1.0,my fiancea literaly almost lost a toe after one time use the shoe looks very nice and thier comfortable to walk in but they have a metal piece inside that crushes your pinky as you walk .he wore them to work and was in horrible pain when he took the shoe off his pinky was purple and thier was a line across his pinky so deep it cut his circulation .I tried wearing then to see if it was only his foot and same thing but luckily i was home and took it of quick.so in conclusion its no good and dangerous .
1.0,This is not velvet at all. It is wanna be Satin. Total misrepresented.
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS SHIRT...YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE IRON PRINT ON THE SHIRT...POORLY MADE N IM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
1.0,"Not worth ot at all, not even costume jewlery. Jems all miss glued, glue all over the place."
1.0,Not material of product in the picture
1.0,"Kinda a piece of crap, but you get what you pay for"
1.0,"These socks don't make my feet feel any warmer.  They make my feet feel &#34;crunchy,&#34; when wearing them.  I do not like them at all."
1.0,This hat is PURPLE and not as depicted. I bought it as a gift and it was a disappointment.
1.0,This dress runs very small. I wear a small and this was like an x small. Not what I was expecting.
1.0,Very very small. The largest size is a like a small.
1.0,Daughter wore one time before it snapped!
1.0,"I bought this watch,thinking it Will be something new and fun..i was wrong the only thing good was the watch metal strap..but the watch itself ugly,not colorful dial as shown,very hard to ser the time,very cheap the only ítem at Amazon i gave one star..by the way i got it for $6 dollars.keep away please and buy anything else"
1.0,"The belt was a little snug, when buckled it and wouldn't stay hidden the inside part. The color was way to orange/ pink, so didnt match watch i wanted it to."
1.0,"Very cheap feeling. Not sherpa-like at all! Very thin, cheap fake fur. Returned it."
1.0,"These scarves are pretty and vibrant, but they are not made to keep you warm.  The scarf looks like a t-shirt that was cut into wide strips.  The edges are just cut edges (unfinished) and will not hold up well in the washing machine.  If you are just looking for a bright decorative scarf, this will work, but if you want to be warm, I suggest that you keep searching."
1.0,"I received this product today and out of the 12 aprons, 5 of them were totally disintegrated and in pieces upon opening the package and a couple of others had holes in them.  I’m not sure what kind of material they are made of (I should have looked before buying) but they rip like paper.  Not worth the hassle to return.  Just beware! Only getting one star because you have to pick one otherwise I would give no stars"
1.0,They don't work. Very unhappy with them a real disappointment
1.0,This bracelet broke within a week.
1.0,"The outfit was nothing like the picture.  A little disappointed in the material.  Somewhat itchy. Wanted to send back, but i took off the tag"
1.0,"So this was closer to orange than Pink, my 13 year old loves it but just keep in mind it’s definitely orange."
1.0,Never received this item. I had to settle for a return. And it was a anniversary gift for my wife so needless to say she wasn't very happy and neither was I.
1.0,Was washed on perma-press cycle. Very wrinkled even when dried on delicate. Returning shipping not covered so will keep this shirt since it is not worth paying the shipping cost to return. Very disappointed!
1.0,"I purchased this bracelet for my daughter's birthday, but upon receipt, there's one of the gemstones has already fallen out of the bracelet, which presented a such poor workmanship, and still passed the final inspection from the manufacturer. Although it looks pretty in design, but the quality and durability are in question."
1.0,Material is very thin and not complimenting in nature.<br />Not sure how this can be worn in a work setting - even for casual wear it was too flimsy.<br />Would not recommend this item for purchase.<br />What made it even worse was during return - without even actually wearing this item - it still has it's tags and everything..the price I paid was not the return pricing and that is very very discouraging. Amazon needs to pick better vendors - this is ridiculous.
1.0,Only received bottoms. No top
1.0,Does not wear well.  Only lasted 1 day and then started to peel.  0 stars!
1.0,"I wear these for work in surgery.  These were cheap, thin material, and poorly made."
1.0,long and narrow lens/frame. Not round . meh.
1.0,Poor quality<br />Tore at the back pocket after being worn twice
1.0,"I am a petite 8-10 size normally but when it comes to swimsuits, I normally wind up ordering a 10-12.  I went with the XL which says it is for a 8-10.  Unfortunately this swimsuit does not fit well.  There are gaps at the leg openings.  There are gaps at the arm openings (in front).  Looking at the picture from the rear, it would appear that the leg openings have a very high rise but they don't - they match the rise of the picture of the swimsuit from the front view where the model is kneeling.  The bottom, rear of the swimsuit gaps at the leg openings.  Also, the colors of the suit are nowhere near as vibrant or pretty as they are as pictured.  The colors on the actual suit look faded and there is more white space than shown in the picture.  I received this product at a discount for my honest review."
1.0,"I ordered up two sizes because I wanted an oversize fit and it fit a little baggy in the body but small on the arms. Also, I ordered the green color and it was closer to a teal."
1.0,I just received the product in the mail. I put it on and its a good fit. a little loose but I have smaller hands. It is breathable and comfortable but the smell is horrible. It smells of pickles and urine. I hope that goes away soon. its really bad. But can I wash this item? I am serious the smell is bad.<br /><br />UPDATE:: they melted together.. Thats not normal. I had them together on my table for maybe 30 minutes and they melted to the table and each other. Save your money people...
1.0,"This sweater does not come in at all as pictured. It was nearly a crop top on me, and I’m only 5’8. It is cut VERY short, not long and loose like the photo makes it appear. Tight and small instead. I got a large when I usually fit in a medium or a large. Felt like I was putting on childrens clothing. Very disappointed."
1.0,Too big never wore it. No support.
1.0,Terrible<br />It arrived with the soles open<br />Terrible qualitu
1.0,WARNING NEVER BUY 0 STARS
1.0,"When the watch band was adjusted to fit the arm, the adjustable snap would not lock into place.  Therefore, the watchband was worthless."
1.0,I disliked this product because it does not fit true to size. I can't even get it up my back. It is also completely see through which is a disappointment because it has the potential to be a very sophisticated yet sexy outfit.
1.0,I really liked these hats. They are soft and kept my kids warm when we went to the snow. But after one use and with out washing they started unraveling around the face. Disappointed that the quality is so poor
1.0,i bought them 2 times  same thing you dont get your money back. they hide the reveiws same fake boots
1.0,"Apart from that the footwear came small, in one of the points is badly stuck, wine defective"
1.0,They broke while sitting in the glove compartment. Didn't even get to wear them. Wouldn't order again.
1.0,Es corriente de muy mala calidad
1.0,Literally didn’t look like the picture at all. Mine was a different color. Different style. Doesn’t even look like the same material. I kept the jacket. But the marketing/advertisements were SO off. Don’t expect this to be a FP dupe. It’s literally not.
1.0,I received two pant suits instead of a romper
1.0,"It was defective .  The minute hand was loose and flopped around, and the talking part wouldn't work.  Returned for refund."
1.0,Took out of the bag but did not even try it on honestly. Material was so thin and cheap. Necklace was not as shown and you had to put it together yourself. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Refunds are also VERY difficult and they charge a restocking fee! Smh
1.0,Did not fit as expected. Too big.
1.0,"Other then small, after you wash them they will look ashy. So the money you pay is for a 1 time use. I made sure they didn't get dried, due to the clothes from some area always have this issue it didn't help."
1.0,XL is more like a L or larger M.
1.0,Made my jewelry look worse. I was going to throw out the few items I tried this cleaner on then on a whim tried cleaning it with charcoal toothpaste. It worked. My silver jewelry was saved by the toothpaste.
1.0,"Do not order! It is not a bathing suit. It is not a two piece! It is basically a cover up if we even want to call it that. I ordered a bigger size Luke the reviews said, and it was way to big.<br />Don't think it is an item to take a chance on. You will be disappointed #"
1.0,Unfortunate. No half sizes so I tried the 8 and it fit like a 9. Had to pay for shipping to send back and try the 7 which fit like a 6. Super disappointed. Didn't want to pay again to return so took the partial refund and will try to find someone that can use them. Bummer
1.0,Has a hole.
1.0,"Didn’t like fabric, style or fit."
1.0,This is supposed to be a sweatshirt dress but it's an A-line mess there is no hood at all.
1.0,tooo expensive
1.0,I ordered a large which is the size I wear. The shirt was may be a large child's shirt. very small and cheaply made shirt. I realize i paid $11 for it but it is something i would never wear i passed it to my son who weighs about 130 lbs. hopefully he will wear it.
1.0,"The seam is over the mouth of the grumpy cat. I waited a long time for this product and it looks bad. I can get a mask anywhere, but I chose to get one from here for my mother. Bummer..."
1.0,"Doesn’t even deserve single star....<br /><br />I just took it out of the package,<br />& the first thing that came off is the Snap back.<br />Just check out the photos. Very disappointing."
1.0,"It says 3XL but its more like a regular large, im disappointed."
1.0,It was a disaster
1.0,and the opening for the button was sewed shut. Had to go a cleaners to have the opening fixed so I could fix them.  Tried to return them but did not receive the label. Received the runaround but credited me my money back so I would not continue to bother them. They were asking me to send pictures but kept saying they were not receiving them or couldn't open them.  Very disappointed.  They are just sitting in my closet because I can't fit them
1.0,"If you have metal sensitivity these will irritate your allergy. I love the size, color and design of these earrings. I just wish they were, as stated in description, hypoallergenic.😢😢😢 I'm adding a photo of my swollen, irritated ear. It even bled!"
1.0,Fits like a shirt!
1.0,I owned the product for one month. We had a shower in the middle of the night. The entire frame collapsed. It was held together by an aluminum wire which broke apart and could not be repaired.
1.0,"The image is a iron on and was all stuck together, like it was folded when still hot and melted together. Colors are muted and off color."
1.0,definitely does not look like the picture.  The buttons are so different too.
1.0,"obvious knock off ,"
1.0,It is not a a very good purchase it is cheaply made. Even for the bargain price.
1.0,"I would have gave it no stars if i could this material is awful, nothing like the image, I wouldn't wear this to bed, I asked for the refund on this it was so bad. DO NOT ORDER, its from china and terrible quality."
1.0,These pants are made well and run big I've tried ordering these 3 times and they keep sending the wrong size so I'm just going to get a refund.
1.0,"This tank top snags so easily! I wore it once and the front is completely destroyed. If you wear it, don’t lean on anything."
1.0,Beautiful but broke day one! I wanted to love this but BOTH claps broke off.
1.0,"I thought I hit a bargain with the price for 5 masks. You get what you pay for. These masks are very flimsy. The plastic is not strong and it collapses. It doesn't close well around the face, chin and nose. I would not recommend these masks."
1.0,Necklace broke second time I wore it. Leather chain broke.
1.0,They were not petite
1.0,"Gave to hubby for Christmas, but they broke in his hand while he was trying them on.  I had told him they were inexpensive, after the break i told him they were inexpensive and cheap - at least we got a laugh."
1.0,Clasp Broke First day.
1.0,Cut too small. I got this size because I wanted it to be oversized. But it actually fit. I normally wear an XL. I gave this raglan to my daughter who wears a small. It is big on her but not so much that she would not wear it.
1.0,The watch looked good but broke with the first wear.
1.0,A hat with a paper decal
1.0,"This is deff not real jade, it's also very dirty made. Mine had black particles that were evidently caught inside in the making. Since I first got it the bracelet has turned to a white-ish color and looks like it has cracks in it."
1.0,"So disappointed, bought for my grandaughter, fit perfect until her mom washed them.  Shrunk so much, they look like capris."
1.0,I was really disappointed with these. They are really cheap looking and uncomfortable.
1.0,Far from the description written by the seller. I throw it in the garbege. It does not worth a penny.
1.0,Comes with a stupid belt... the sizing is horrible. The pants are to baggy and not true size. Only good if your a fat guy.
1.0,"My son wore these to school only for about 2weeks, and they are falling apart. The sole is coming apart from the canvas, and on the inside, there's a piece of the fabric that is catching his toes from the top where the shoelace area is reinforced."
1.0,Everything was beautiful but the teeth didn't stick in any form.
1.0,"Product was not sized appropriately, it was really more like a size 40-42 waist when I ordered a size 36.  It was given as a gift so by the time i was told it was too large, it was past the product return time."
1.0,"Way Too big, otherwise looked as expected"
1.0,Cheap fabric. I will never wear this
1.0,Runs smaller not comfortable
1.0,"I was expecting this to be a little loose or even a little snug, but the 3xl fits like an xs. Now I’m stuck with something I cannot wear."
1.0,I had such high hopes for these.. they are extremely itchy around the band where the elastic is. The cotton is super soft though.
1.0,"Third bike-ride in and it ripped like made out of paper.  Actual stitching did not rip, the material did. This is in the spot where it’s intended to be pulled down over your hips to protect from cold."
1.0,"Way TOO SMALL-,AND BEWARE●THIS IS A 3RD PARTY SELLER IN CHINA<br />....IT WOULD COST ME $300 FOR POSTAGE TO SEND IT BACK"
1.0,Awful quality and extremely small. Stay away
1.0,All they do is color everything yellow.  It does not take the glare away.  Not impressed.
1.0,"This broke within 30 seconds of me trying to attach it to my fit bit. GARBAGE, i will be getting my money back !!!!!"
1.0,"I wanted to love this skirt. The skirt itself is so cute and stylish. However, mine came with visible stains/marks from the black part of the skirt  scuffing onto the white while it was folded up and packaged. Perhaps the seller should have put layers of tissue paper to prevent this issue in the future. The zipper was also slightly stuck and hard to open. I noticed a reviewer below me identifying as Noel had the same issue.  Sadly I will be returning this skirt, despite how cute it is I am not okay with walking around appearing to be wearing something dirty. Sighs. Such a shame."
1.0,"Cheesy, horrible bag. Not at all what I expected which was a simple, good-looking tote. It's going back.<br /><br />I need a return sticker."
1.0,Very disappointed with them. Material is very cheap and it looks cheap.
1.0,Very cheap yet way too expensive
1.0,Received this item and the angels skirt was melted and disformed
1.0,"The dress looks nice the style and everything, I just didn't like the fabric.<br />It just didn't look good on me that's all.<br />I  gave the  dress away."
1.0,"The material is very cheep, Because I don't have a printer it would cost me to return it. I will not be but I buying from same seller again."

1.0,Zipper is very cheap and will not work! I will be returning.
1.0,Arrived broken.  Inserted the batteries and it never worked.  Not even for a little bit.  Very disappointed.  Returned for a refund.
1.0,"The color, size, and look was off! Did not look like display picture. The rings are hard to adjust for various sizes. Horrible"
1.0,It’s more like a dress sock material. It’s a very odd shape and pretty junky. I’d say go to Etsy and get a better made one
1.0,Turning colors
1.0,Turned brown after just 2 hours.
1.0,This mask is made for a large man I would say. When I tried it on it was sliding off my face. Can't adjust the straps.... material is also very itchy and uncomfortable.... Will try to return it.
1.0,Super long bought for my almost 6 yr old she is kinda big for age and its to her knees
1.0,I hope I stop someone from buying this. Thought it was the same brand I bought a few year ms ago for a costume. It’s not and it sucks. No coverage at all and goes in clumpy. Running out to Walgreens to see if I can find blank and white makeup to salvage my costume for party tonight.
1.0,Does not drap down lower in the front. Material is very cheap as well.
1.0,Awful fit didn't look good on me at all.
1.0,La pantalla no funsiono mas despues de la segunda semana
1.0,"This product is, suppose to be for an adult. I will never order any clothes item<br />Again it's so deceiving  so bye<br />So kissed will be returning the item<br />ASAP FOR A FULL REFUND<br />The product clearly say women<br />IT'S so dann small a kid about 12 or younger probably can fit"
1.0,"Small, doesn't cover reasonable sized glasses.  Very dark grey.  Only acceptable in dazzling direct sunlight - partial shade is a no-go."
1.0,Ordered a 3xl and it fits more like a large.  I cannot wear this.
1.0,Bought because reviews said they weren't see through.. some of the MOST see through leggings I have EVER seen.
1.0,Arrived in a box that was literally falling apart and the holster broke while unpacking it. My son never even got to play with them.
1.0,Not at all like the photo. Barely hits below the hips
1.0,The size small
1.0,"My daughter is 5 foot 4, and if she raised her arms a little bit, you would see waaayyy too much. If she were to add the belt on, it would take up the length that much more. Not sure how tall the model in the picture is, but that is not close to how it look on. Unfortunate."
1.0,"I seriously had to put on reading glasses to even begin to see the shape of the stones.  One thing that is apparent, is that these hoops are not round.  They have a weird flat round on the bottom and towards the back.  So it's not a sphere, but rather an attempt at a sphere.  Sending back.  It's only $10, but I'm not getting taken advantage of here."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture more like pajamas. I ordered a size medium & it fit like an xl
1.0,"No viene El Material Que Seve en la foto, pero están bonitas😔🤭"
1.0,The black studs fall out when I try to put them on my crocs it seems to be they use cheap glue.
1.0,"Looks good on, runs big and if you get the wrong size you have to pay to send it back."
1.0,Since u wont leave me alone about writing a review. For the money i think the workmanship  of this product is poor.The quality of these gloves is below average.  Im sure they made in china somewhere and u buy them for 1.00<br /> Would not purchase a vetelli product again!!!!!
1.0,Received with couple pairs broken :( too cheap to return
1.0,Horrendous cut. Did awful things to my body. Shortened my torso and made my round booty look flat and unflattering. If it wasn’t the brides choice for all her bridesmaids it would have been sent back that day! Awful
1.0,not a very good quality broke while wearing the item
1.0,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SLIMMER BELT EVER MADE!!!..... ME AND MY BEST FRIEND BOUGHT ONE ON THE SAME DAY AND BOTH ZIPPERS POP RIGHT OFF.... WHAT A JUNK...PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1.0,"do not be fooled like I was, This is not a sky coat, Its more of a spring rain jacket DO NOT BUY THIS"
1.0,"Very poor quality fabric, AND it came with a big slice out of it.  Even with out the damage though, I would have returned it."
1.0,After a few months of use every single shirt is falling apart.  Reflective stripe is extremely restricting and impedes mobility. Thus causes the shirts to tear.  These shirts are horrible. I remember why I only use Carhartt.  This was a waste of money.  Would never recommend or buy again.
1.0,The collar that showed up was a pointed collar NOT a rounded peter pan type collar. Sending back. Need a rounded one.
1.0,The rubber tube that attaches the cord to the glasses split.  This was in the trash in two weeks.
1.0,"I love Naot shoes/sandals and own many pair (they are pretty much the only brand I wear), and I had high hopes for this style, but found them surprisingly uncomfortable. I ordered my usual Naot size, and they seemed to fit initially, but then I noticed that they were shorter than I usually wear, there was no arch support (a mainstay in Naot shoes/sandals), and my knees started to hurt after wearing them around the house for about 15 minutes. These are going back. The style is cute and the workmanship is up to par, but they are not comfortable at all."
1.0,Awful material...cut weird and not flattering at all!
1.0,Of no use.  Makes me dizzy.
1.0,"This dress looks really pretty on the girl modeling it in the picture, however It didn’t look as great on me. The material is vey thin so it doesn’t do well on hiding the size handles or extra curves per say;) The style is pretty, but the thin material just didn’t make me look flattering."
1.0,The charm is much smaller than it appears and the writing is very difficult to read. Disappointed.
1.0,"This pendant does not much with the prescription!!it is smaller and way too light,definitely not 19 g as stated!!very disappointed,I had to return it"
1.0,Smaller then what my daughter wears by larger
1.0,It fell apart within a week
1.0,El mono era demasiado pequeño para mí talla M.  La tela pésima. Se rasgó por la espalda. Estaba con cortes .como que se deshace . Pésima compra. Nunca me había pasado esto. Lástima q no puedo devolver porque estoy en otro país.
1.0,"After wearing this band for exactly two days, the coloring is already beginning to wear off.  Totally awful, unacceptable quality."
1.0,"Poorly made , quality is horrible , threads are loosely unraveling and coming off ... I fear to even wash this now . Do not waste your money . It’s not stitched well . Doesn’t fit anywhere and anyhow and I did get the appropriate size"
1.0,"I'm 5'3"" and weigh 108. I wear a small in everything, but in sweatshirts I often get a medium so it's roomy. I bought this in a medium and its way too small. I cannot get it on."
1.0,"Didn't even last 6 months, wrist strap broke and the lining tore"
1.0,Bought these for my kids and they run VERY small.  They couldn't use them in our few days of winter weather here in Southern Texas.
1.0,"Hi the dress looks great in the picture here, but when I received, first of all the fabric is really clingy and thin, secondly the style fits looks totally different from what’s show in picture!"
1.0,ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!!!  DO NOT BUY...colors nothing close to picture!!
1.0,Disappointed; product received was not as viewed with no instructions on how to put together. Material was a rose gold with the gold chains.
1.0,"Worked once, but never seen anything last as long as I do in bed... 5 seconds and it was done... All she wrote... Now I’m getting a divorce... Not really on the divorce, but the wife an I where pretty disappointed..."
1.0,"I had to return this, when it arrived it didn't work."
1.0,doesnt look like the picture
1.0,These are really small! When you put them on the print is on the surface and the design has a lot of white space.
1.0,NO instructiona placed in plastic bag they came in. Cant figure out how to connect them to each other.
1.0,Poor quality I return the item.
1.0,I hate the material and do not plan to ever wear it.
1.0,I wear a 2xl  I ordered a 3xl  This is so undersized it probably would fit XL. Buyer beware
1.0,Received the item with stone already loose in the packaging.  Returning and will purchase a set at a local dept store
1.0,If you have a big toe that wants to be part of what's in the sock you won't want these. 1/2 a day and they're done!<br />Stay away!
1.0,Runs small. Fabric cheap.
1.0,"Not only were the boots 2 or 3 sizes smaller than marked, Shoe Mall has been deceitful and uncooperative about refunding my money. The matter is under investigation by Amazon Customer Service."
1.0,Looks really cute online. Looks a hot mess in person!
1.0,Not very good.
1.0,"I really really dislike this product I bought for my son for his prom.. If I had the time I would have sent back for a refund. The material is so cheaply made, especially the pants! Smh do not buy.. most definitely not worth it.. Unless you mind getting cheaply made clothes."
1.0,Advertised as 4 pair....I only received 1 pait.
1.0,Came broken in half
1.0,"Seriously sized for little kids. I usually wear a small or medium. Ordered a medium and does not fit also cheap fabric, so thin. Not a flannel at all. It's garbage don't buy."
1.0,The pocket was sewn on wrong and misshapen! It’s not even wearable!
1.0,too small for a 3 year old.
1.0,"I did not read carefully before buying, but it is a wrap dress with a rope. I bought the small one but it ends up too big on me, and especially the part around the chest area it is super big. It does not have any buttons, so it is very easy to let everybody see what inside you. If you have a small chest, I do truly not recommend this dress. I decide to return even though I bought it for a cheap price."
1.0,"I have tried on many swimsuits this summer looking for one with a high neckline. This is overwhelmingly the worst I have tried on this summer and maybe ever in my life. The fit is off by a lot from what the size chart states and there is no bust support of any kind. The bust area has removable pads, which are shaped in a cartoonishly round way, but if you remove them the material is so thin you might as well be topless. The white stripes on the bottom are completely see thru."
1.0,Me and my friend both wore these in our daith. After a few weeks they made our ears really itchy. When I took it out it was green. And my friends ear became really sore and swollen. Wouldn’t recommend for prolonged wear.
1.0,"VERY cheap, not even worth the small amount paid for it. Will be returning it.<br /> The “B” is HUGE, and super flimsy gold plastic, scratchy cheap “pearls”.... just bad. Especially if you have a very nice Courtiers gown- this won’t work."
1.0,This stone is too small even for that amount of money
1.0,Cheap material and WAY too big
1.0,my daughter bought this as a prom dress hoping for the best. she was so excited when we got it in the mail only to find out the crease was almost to her stomach and was right in the middle! DO NOT BUY
1.0,Item clasp tarnished after 1 month
1.0,Very disappointed because the paint rubs off under the straps and the soles of my feet.  I can't return them cause I wore them but I will throw them out -
1.0,Terrible. Clasp broke in two seconds.
1.0,"Esta muy grande, la talla que viene corresponde mínimo a 3 tallas mas grandes"
1.0,Very wrinkled even after washing and drying as directed. It has to be ironed to be worn. Who has time for that?<br />Thought since it was cotton and poly it would not wrinkle.<br />Material is stiff also.<br />Dont have time to replace this so it will have to be worn.<br />Says designed in Italy but also says made in China!
1.0,"Pants are a weird feel, cheap fiber.  Creaks.  Definitely not cotton.  Do not buy!"
1.0,"The first time it was used, it wouldnt open, then wouldn't close, then stuck open then fell apart! I hate to leave a bad report but hopefully the manufacturer can re-invent a working version of this nice looking umbrella."
1.0,"Weird fit that can’t be fixed, cheap material, cheap version of hot miami styles dress"
1.0,It’s to tight to move around.  The material looks like it can easily be torn. Lastly the zipper on leg scratches the knee
1.0,"I am sick and tired of shoes being too narrow to fit my foot. I dont even wear ""W"" wide shoes! I wear normal sizes. why make shoes that are this narrow??? who does it help? make them a normal size and people with narrow feet can wear thicker socks. people with typical and wide sized feet cant peel away skin and bone to make things fit. please stop the madness."
1.0,"For the price, product is of low quality.  Design is not as crisp as shown online.  Color comes across with a purple tint."
1.0,Not true fit very small I have order a xxxl and it for a small person my daughter is small and still like that didn’t close on her
1.0,I sent this top back Way too large
1.0,Cheap nylon fabric. Much smaller than expected. Did not fit as an adult headband. Very disappointed.
1.0,Very cheaply made an awful shoe
1.0,Lovely piece but spring in clasp broke within a few weeks. Cheap fix but when will I find the time... hmmmm
1.0,Way too big for my daughter
1.0,"This is a post earring without a functional wrap.  The dragon's wing is fused to the wrap, leaving less than 1"" space to wrap over the top of your ear.  I can't even wear it as an earring."
1.0,bad quality... one year less already broke
1.0,These are horrible. I was so excited to get them in the mail. They look like costume glasses you’d get at the $1 store
1.0,"These are much too tight. Bought for my brother, he couldn’t stand to wear them."
1.0,Arrived quick but not color qas supposed to be. Ordered orange plaid- shirt arrived red and runs small. Was supposed to be for a wedding😔
1.0,"I bought this one to my son asa Xmas gift who is a lax player and loves wearing bracelets.<br />He could not wear it more than couple of minutes. It said it is so uncomfortable and bulky. It did not look nice as well. Looked kind of cheap, like what you get from an arcade with your tickets. So.. not recommend 😕"
1.0,It broke after 3 wearings.
1.0,Order was cancelled
1.0,China sizes
1.0,The fabric was cheap and not soft like other sweaters like I have bought before this year. I bought similar one at Walmart for $14.00 that far exceed this sweater.
1.0,My main concern was that the stitching was poorly done.  Some of the threads were caught up in a zipper and some stitches were coming apart upon first inspection.  It was also confusing as to how to fold up the backpack into a small pouch for travel.  Won't be keeping this backpack.
1.0,"They are cool looking but super cheap. They broke within a week. These are more like costume quality sunglasses, not for everyday wear."
1.0,I tried this on several times for several different events and cannot bring myself to wear it.  It just looks cheap all around and weird.  The liner only goes about to mid thigh on me and works its way up as I walk and the outer material is sheer.  The edges are sewn weirdly there’s no real hem.
1.0,This dress was very pretty. That's it I got it two size bigger then my normal size and it was too small. I would not buy anything else from this designer
1.0,Too small!  I wear a small and it seems to be for a child.
1.0,These were the skinniest of skinny jeans I have ever seen. I couldn’t even put my legs in them. If you are scrawny these may fit you.
1.0,"In the picture, It looks like the skirt portion of the dress would come down to mid to lower thigh. In reality, it's SHORT really really SHORT. I'm not very tall - I'm just 5'4&#34; and it's so short it's unwearable. I bought tights to go with it, but it would need pants instead - it's more like a long blouse. It does kind of make you look pregnant...which isn't really a desirable fashion choice."
1.0,The sole of the slipper started breaking down at the seam...all around base of shoe. I wouldn’t recommend. Bought a size 5 for 7yr old. I’ll get her slippers from Khols or Walmart next time.
1.0,Looks more like a shirt then a dress.
1.0,"I've had to return this dress 3 times! The first time the dress was very small, I ordered a medium. I'm 5'3, 145lbs and I wear a size 8.<br />I redoreder the large and it fit great, but the patten was upside down. So, I sent it back, ordered a 3rd dress, and the pattern is upside down again.<br />The parttern was right side up on the medium.<br />I guess I will keep trying until I get a large dress with the pattern right side up, and I will update this review when I get a good dress.<br /><br />Update: I received my 4th dress today, and the patters are upside down again. I will try again.<br /><br />Update#2: I now believe this dress does not come in a large with the patter right side up.<br />I did however find a dress with the same pattern<br />From the company LaceLady. That dress was also on Amazon prime, it was cheaper, and the cut was a lot cuter. So, my advice to any one who loves this print, search Amazon for  LaceLady skull dress, and buy from them!"
1.0,"I bought this item today from my local Walgreens for $19.99.  You would think an item meant to &#34;hide your extra weight and bumps and bulges&#34; would be designed for a larger body.  Why on earth would they sew the arms so small?  I'm not a large gal, I weigh 130 pounds and stand 5' 5, and I don't have particularly large arms.  I'm not toothpick lady but my arms are not beefy.  I was surprised when I put it on and found the arms way too snug for comfort.  You cannot pull them up; I'm wondering how Suzanne was able to do it in the photo.  There are other issues with this garment . . . the body of the top is very tent like and hangs in an unflattering way.  The fabric is also very thin, which can be a plus if you get hot flashes but the problem is it has no weight to it so it wrinkles something awful. The length covered my butt so you can wear it with leggings, however if you have a long torso this may not be the case for you.  I have a short waist so things will hang differently on me.  The overall look of this top is cheap.  I really wanted to like this because it seemed so attractive in the ad.  I'm glad I kept my receipt."
1.0,The size does not match the written.
1.0,I purchased these for myself thinking they would fit well... i was wrong...they wont go past my finger nail....I normally wear a size 6 ring these are definitely made for children. .. to my 3 year daughter they go!
1.0,"Very small, child size. Poor / minimal color variations of pearls."
1.0,the ring guard was to small it didn't say that it was for small rings only didn't use it<br /><br />  roger h Alix
1.0,"Good quality pants, good quality denim fabric, good stitching and extra wide elastic waste band, all around good/great quality pants. I will return this pair and keep guessing as to the correct size for me, as sizes not given correctly in inches. I imagine after 4 or 5 trys I'll find a pair that fits and revise this review.  1 Star  CDW"
1.0,"This hat is cute, except for the cheesy plastic snap-thingy on back..."
1.0,Not for anyone larger than a small B cup
1.0,"Didn't work at all, if anything it made the mess on my boots even worse. I don't suggest this product."
1.0,I was charged for two when I only ordered one and I get both sets well there's five that does not unscrew  top or bottom and one came out into pieces
1.0,You get what you pay for. It looks terrible and cheap. Returned.
1.0,"I bought this exact set of briefs at Costo in a Medium size and they were the perfect fit. Bought the exact set in Medium size from this source on Amazon and they ain't gonna fit. Toooooo small. I laid a pair from both sets side by side and the difference in size is very apparent. I was naive in my assumption that the sets would be exact, so I  tossed the packaging and now I am unable to return them for replacement. Drat. My advice is to &#34;go bigger&#34;."
1.0,"Cheap, smells weird, uncomfortable crossbody strap length."
1.0,Shirt was too small. Bought a 2T for my 2 year old. It fit like a 12 month shirt. You would have to buy 2 sizes up but why risk it not fitting ?
1.0,My picture says it all<br />I was really excited about my purchase only to find out that the chain is fragile and that little loop there is very weak like costume jewelry ...this one Stone does not look like whats advertised also
1.0,This footies are terrible.  I bought 2 different brands.  The 1st set reviews were spot on- great fit stayed in place.  These did not make it 1 step before rolling under the foot. Trash
1.0,handle broke off in the first 15 minutes of play
1.0,"Product runs small. Color shades lighter than in picture. Material ok, made well enough."
1.0,They look nice but I can't open them! I will be returning them.
1.0,"To thin, see through"
1.0,one of the shoe stopped charging the second day.
1.0,To Small do not waste your money.  My hat size is 7 3/8.
1.0,"not only does it take over a MONTH to arrive, the fit is super crazy"
1.0,"Very thin, see-through fabric. Tight fit on my husband, even though these are listed as a man’s product."
1.0,Doesn't look as pictured
1.0,"The pink does not look as shown. Its alot more...vibrant? To me the pic looks like a greyed or dusty pink. Also, the fit?.. Let's just say its super cute on the model. It does look like the pic, as far as style. I ordered my usual size and I'd say it was a bit snug around the chest. I don't think it was a ""order up a size"" issue though. It just wasn't flattering."
1.0,"Please do not waste your money on these molds. They don't ever harden up like you need them to, to cast a true mold. Everytime I put my grill on, the mold is soft. After 2 or 3 times, the grill just falls out, because the mold is pretty much ""stripped"", like a screw. My original mold lasted 2 years. I have went through all of these in less than 6 months. And I wore my grill way more when I got it. Don't buy these. I just order 2 sets from the people I got my grill from. It is solid 18 CT white gold with diamond flakes. It wasn't cheap."
1.0,I sent it back..... the advertisement promoted it better than it was....
1.0,DONT BUY THIS!!!!!  The mask is WAY too small for even a small child... Also the words as well as Chucky's feet are cut off where they carelessly sewed it together... Extremely cheap feeling cloth also.. just 100% a waste of time and money.
1.0,"Very cheap material, fits extremely small.  Also, it's a crop top so don't expect it to be like a normal sweatshirt.  J would not recommend this product."
1.0,Turnaround time and shipping too long. Return and refund took almost a month.  Pants too large  ordered a small fit like a large.  I'm a sz 4 125lbs 5ft 4&#34;..liked the fabric and style but looked a little cheesy.
1.0,It broke. This style always does. Terrible design. Third one already
1.0,so sheer/see thru
1.0,The quality right leg was higher than the left leg of the pants.
1.0,Didn’t fit a normal glass design
1.0,Day 5 of having it in my pocket already dropping color dye.
1.0,Waaaay too small and I only received 6 all different colors not the 8
1.0,"Not like picture shows. Very baggy and tons of material. Very thin, and if I wasn’t returning then I would definitely need to buy a slip so it’s not see through."
1.0,This product fit is irregular.. The shirt was a size small which the body hits great but the arms reached just below  my sons elbows not satisfied at all..he is a tiny boy but the sleeves r way to short
1.0,I thought blouse was pretty and nice quality but arm hole was so small...this item is for a very slim person or a child.
1.0,"Unfortunately, I had to return the shirt due to it being way too large.  It was boxy, larger than expected, and just not a good fit."
1.0,Sizes run small. Really tight on breasts
1.0,This dress is so huge ! The quality is not even nice ! The color is beautiful but this dress is not what it shows in the picture
1.0,Just wore them for the first time today and the nose piece falls out every time I take them off... even into my plate of food while we were out eating... Junk!
1.0,I ordered several of these in a variety of colors in a size large since I read that they run small.  This too fit horribly. Sleeves were too long and it was extrembly short in the torso.  Not well proportioned. Returned them all.
1.0,Very Poor quality fabric.<br />Material ripps easly every time mask is put on.
1.0,Dollar store is better
1.0,"This Watch came quickly and I loved the face of the watch. I love the color of the watch and the size of the numbers. The band ran a little small. I am big boned. Yes big boned, not fat and it fit but I would have liked the band larger. What I mostly did not like about the watch is that it is already broken and I can no longer wear it. the buckle broke off. Waste of money... very disappointed. Cathy L"
1.0,Cheap imitation of the dress pictured.
1.0,"Very cheaply made and tinted glass was need in gold frame, it was out of frame on both rims. I return them. If course returns and refunds always are good with Amazon."
1.0,On the picture it doesn't show that it has wings on side to side it only shows half of the picture so I was not what I expected
1.0,Love the deep pockets going buy another color. Very comfortable.
1.0,70 % of the Lettering has faded off already
1.0,"The seams ripped on the first day of wear, near the crotch, and the back of the underwear tends to slide down your backside all day long. I will not be purchasing these again. So disappointed."
1.0,Waistband is not true to size. Order 1 size up.
1.0,"Trash. Went to put the lei over my head and it broke. All of the flowers went all over my floor. So much for that, guess I won’t have a lei with my Halloween costume."
1.0,The watches does not work.
1.0,Cheap....not impressed
1.0,"Pretty in the pictures, but looked kind of cheap in person. I returned it."
1.0,"Don't waste your money.  It is WAY smaller than you would expect.....I wear a large t-shirt size, so I ordered 4x in this shirt after reading the reviews, hoping for a loose fit. No way. It's STILL too small. It looks nothing like the picture. The quality, it's like someone took a really low quality pillow case and added sleeves to it.(And there's elastic all around the waste band .....I swear it looks like a really cheap altered bed sheet) You would get better quality from a Walmart t-shirt. Even if this thing did fit, it's still ugly....horrible tailoring, horrible material."
1.0,No support in the top
1.0,The quality of this dress was awful. The sash was uneven and the pleats at the halter were off. I was so completely disappointed with this dress. It is absolutely being returned!.
1.0,Bag was so small! could barely fit a towel. I returned it.
1.0,"flimsy and poorly designed; the wing and head broke off within one week of attempting to wear this thing, and I think it was assembled backwards. ordered two thinking I'd lose one - neither was worth the expense. just get real silver for a few more bucks instead."
1.0,"Sizing wasn’t that great. I bought a medium. The bottoms were big in the waist but the top was a little tight. Ultimately, I returned it because they felt like stretchy plastic. If you don’t mind that weird feel, they’re fine pajamas. Just not for me."
1.0,Never could get them to work. They always fell off. Maybe meant for woman under size D boobs
1.0,I got the necklace for my daughter's friend because I thought it was cute but most of all I got it for the saying that was behind it that saying does not come with the necklace
1.0,Def not impressed ! They said order bigger I’m a large and i ordered an xl and it hangs off me fits like an xxxl I’d like to send back for my money back but leaving on vacation
1.0,Ordered a med and they fit my 10 year old
1.0,"Well, I should have been more careful. The shape looks nice, but it is really tooooo small. I wouldn't recommend getting it to anybody... if you want something cheap, get earings just with a simple round shape. the delivery was very quick though and i am keeping the earings - it still can make a nice gift to a teenager."
1.0,"This dress is nothing like the picture, the color of the lace is nothing to match the bottom of the dress,"
1.0,I did not ask to deliver my order to some locker at a 7-11 I have no idea where it is . Why would I want to get in my car and go pick up a pair of sunglasses? I would buy a pair at 7-11 if I wanted to drive to god knows where and pick up this package. Not good. Not acceptable. And if it happens again you’ve lost a customer.
1.0,"This material is terrible.  The straps go way down so your bra shows.  There is nothing redeeming about this tank top, whatsoever.  If I could give zero stars, I would."
1.0,This thing is worthless. Just a clip put onto a piece of plastic. You could make this for $1!
1.0,"I was able to try them on so I know they fit.  However, there was a very sharp thing at the end of a zipper on the right shoe that scratched my foot"
1.0,way to heavy. I tried to return it but had issues with the return label since i have a PO box...
1.0,Hi i love it but it doesn't fit my wrist
1.0,"Per the sizing chart measurements, I ordered a large (am 5’9 and +/- 130 lbs) which was entirely too large. Out of the “box” the vibrant red pictured looked rather faded, and I could not adjust the straps to be short  enough to fit my neckline. This might have all been forgivable if the dress didn’t rip in the middle of the butt after being washed BY HAND and dried on a line."
1.0,"Cheap material, too thin and see through. Would need to wear a slip. Material is stretchy and I am sure this dress will get stretched out. Fit is weird and not flattering. Looks like a tent on me. Will wear as a nightgown. Wouldn’t wear this outside the house."
1.0,Disappointed that I didn’t receive at least a pair of every color pictured! Will still work for my project but won’t buy from this company again! Got a lot of repetitive colors and not such a great price for so many of the same colors!
1.0,"It's super flimsy. The way it was sent, the brim got smooshed on half, and now it has a permanent wrinkle. It's a bummer, because it's really cute."
1.0,I expected more quality … quality is horrible and takes forever to get on my mail .. almost a month from China …
1.0,It didn't fit. The
1.0,Feels cheap. Looks cheap. Buttons 2 different colors. NOT a bright blue as shown at all. DONT BOTHER BUYING
1.0,These sunglasses should be advertised as baby sunglasses not ' kid '. They do not even fit my 3 year old and were bought for a 5 year old !
1.0,The product color was nothing like the add.
1.0,"Narrow, plastic feel. Made in China garbage. Worth $15 at best."
1.0,"So very disappointed, the blue must be invisible! put it in the sun and you barely see a hint of sky blue... what the hell!"
1.0,Received the white one with stains and very thin material
1.0,I wear a ladies 10/12 and this was way too tight. Also a lot shorter in length than i was expecting. I wasn’t able to use this at all
1.0,"When I first got the dress, I absolutely loved it. I went with other reviewer's feedback to buy a size slightly up - which I normally do anyway, as I sit between a M/L - and it fit perfectly. I am 5'9, 175lb, and went with a size large. I wore the dress to work and got a ton of compliments! It is super comfy; the material is light and a bit stretchy. There is no built-in slip, so you will need to either wear light/flesh colored undies (as I did) or wear a slip underneath. I felt adorable and comfortable all day. However, as much as I love the dress, I have to give it less than 5 stars. When I washed this dress (in a bag, cold water, delicate cycle as I do with all my dresses), the colors faded from the skirt. Because the skirt is red and the stripes are white/black, the red color washing out made some of my stripes a light pinkish color. Thankfully, Amazon refunded the item for me. Since I loved the feel and fit so much, I went ahead and ordered the dress again and will just be hand-washing it to avoid the same issue... a bit of a pain, but worth it, I think, for the price and adorable dress. Bear in mind if you want this same dress, you will likely need to do the same.<br /><br />UPDATE: Unfortunately, I feel the need to update my review. After my initial purchase and return, I ordered a replacement of this exact design along with another style of the same dress. The other style (green bottom, blue/white/green flower print top) arrived first, and I noticed stitching flaws along the waistband, where the waistband had been stitched OVER extra fabric, leaving a hanging tag of extra fabric that was visible. The top of the other dress was also not the same type of fabric as this dress; it is thin when worn, and the design washes out when stretched. So far not so good, but I anticipated receiving another great version of this dress, so I thought it would be okay. Wrong. The replacement version of this dress also had stitching issues along the waistband, where stitching was clearly visible. In addition, the pattern on the sleeves was stitched in such a way that the pattern noticeably didn't match. Unfortunately, I am now returning both versions of the dress, and will not be purchasing another."
1.0,Bottom Broke down after three days of wear
1.0,It is so pretty but the clasp won't stay shut and I almost lost my watch several times. I don't have any issues with any other watch bands.
1.0,I bought a pair washed them and the shredded after that one wash.
1.0,watch stem wouldn't move demetrius
1.0,"this is not cotton , looks very CHEAP"
1.0,Material is very cheap . Stitches under breast area already coming loose .
1.0,Horrible took my money and I never saw the item
1.0,Do not fit at all
1.0,"I am 5.1', 110lbs, and a medium doesn't fit!!😡😡"
1.0,Order off of measurements but fit too small. Gave to my daughter rather than deal with the hassell of returning.
1.0,"This is the cheapest material i have ever seen in my life. Go to Walmart and get a jacket, it will be far superior to this piece of crap."
1.0,Too small. Had to return
1.0,Material is ok but not for women who are heavy in the chest area.
1.0,Shower. I wanted to Fillmore study in the shower the top strap is not very giving at all it’s rather hard so pinches your foot a little
1.0,"Size was way off, much too large and too long.  Punishment for that is me paying $6.18 to ship back.  I won't buy from this company again."
1.0,"The standard clip that has been used for decades have been changed on this new models, therefore we need to take off the prescription glasses and use both hands to put it on . Guess how you can do it if you are driving and need to use the clip on."
1.0,"I pulled these straight from the package this morning and wore them for maybe 3 hours on a padded chair watching my daughter cheer. As I was leaving a friend embarrassingly pointed out that I had holes all in the back of my leggings. I realize they are cheap, but it would have been nice to wear them a full day at least or even better, more than once!"
1.0,my review is that why can they have decent looking ladies. Does women look grotesk.
1.0,This dress would of been great if I had gotten the string for the back to close the dress. What a disaster I need it for this week thanks a lot. Only<br />Got one star because that’s the lowest I could of gotten
1.0,Came very bent and had to do work to fix them and they just continued to warp back.
1.0,Ridiculously small.  Joke
1.0,No laces make it impossible for the shoe to stay on.
1.0,"I was really excited to receive these earrings, they are the exact size I've been looking for forever. They're very pretty.<br /><br />However, two of the three pairs are completely unusable. I cannot get them open no matter how hard I try. One of the larger pair is actually a little warped now from trying so hard to lift the lever.<br /><br />Total bummer."
1.0,I finally opened the package and there was only 2 skirts! No black one at all
1.0,Nope.  Just nope.  Don’t waste your time or money.  MUCH smaller than the photo would have you believe
1.0,"Very tiny, was small enough just to be a necktie. Useless."
1.0,"I bought this I think 2 months back and one day it just broke out of nowhere, probably because it's not good quality."
1.0,"the idea is great, however it is not functional. I bought this for my 5 year old daughter whose glasses keep sliding down her nose. I was so excited I found something that would work and couldn't wait to get it. However, in order for her glasses not to fall, the band needs to be really tight and it's nearly impossible for her to take it off herself. She would most likely break her glasses. Secondly, the band that fits into the frame is so thick that it makes her ears stick out. I was really hoping this would work, it's unfortunate"
1.0,Damaged upon arrival.
1.0,The pins that secure the band to the fitbit are too short. Doesn't attach to the body.
1.0,My piece is tarnishing
1.0,"It's a nice looking bag but the clasps are cheap and the first time I used it they both broke, snapped, and I don't carry anything heavy in my purse so now I cannot use the longer shoulder strap."
1.0,"when i opened the package, i tried it on and realized there was a button missing from the top of the overalls. sizes run small"
1.0,Very disappointed in the quality of this purse. My main issue is that it stinks and not like new material or anything I have ever bought before. I opened it and noticed it immediately so I laid it out to try to help the smell and even spritzed some perfume on the insid but it still to this day smells horrible so I can't even use it. Very disappointed.
1.0,These were delivered June 7th and on June 25th they started falling apart. What else needs to be said?
1.0,"Not what I was expecting. They are heavy, not lightweight as advertised. They are so heavy they don't ""cool"". I will not wear them summers. In colder weather I wear regular socks so I'm not sure when, if ever, I will wear these."
1.0,The mask was upside down. I bought this for my son’s birthday and he can’t wear it. Soooo disappointed.
1.0,Poor fit and poor materials. Threw away after one day
1.0,It came quickly and was packaged well but the material is awful. Very scratchy against my skin. I returned the blouse with no problems.
1.0,It doesn’t help at all
1.0,El producto es de muy mala calidad la tela. Parece tela impermeable. No lo recomiendo.
1.0,This necklace is a joke it's for a small child  ....
1.0,I ordered a boys medium and received a shirt an adult could fit into. I do not like this shirt material. Do not purchase.
1.0,Cheap thin material. Super short arms and snug.
1.0,"Bought several pairs of these expecting to love them, but each pair has one leg longer than the other!  I mean one leg is about 2-3” shorter than the other leg.  Ridiculous!  Ordered 5 pairs.  Returning 5 pairs."
1.0,Never received. They ignore my requests for a refund over and over.
1.0,"Not what I expected, not of high quality"
1.0,Was not as pictured at all. The shape was completely off.  Did not like at all. Returned.
1.0,Disliked everything about it. False advertising
1.0,"Wow, where do I even begin??!! The material was extremely flimsy. The text was a cheap print; it looked like a child painted it on. There was no hemming, and it looked as though the neckline and bottom of the shirt were cut with scissors. The neckline was jagged, uneven, and far too wide. Even though I ordered a size small, the top could fit loosely over me WHILE I WAS WEARING A SWEATSHIRT! Way too big. Do not waste your money; I knew when I opened it, I had to return it. One of the worst products ever received. ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS!!!"
1.0,"Will not fit a normal sized adult, size 6 women's."
1.0,The thing that arrived looked nothing like the picture. It's hideous. The fabric is an awful poly weave material with a sweater-like trim. The trim is just a thin strip of material. This isn't a sweater/cardigan but a long sleeve shirt with sweater trim. The bulk material is a weird poly fabric that reminds me of what uniforms are made from.
1.0,Bought this for my 2 yr old who is obsessed with pandas but it’s enormous! Fits me better than her. So sad. Material also isn’t breathable.
1.0,The material of this skirt is EXTREMELY THIN...jist like a tshirt. Skirt keeps getting  between my legs. Returned.
1.0,"See through material, can’t see that in pic, can see all the seams when you put it on, looks horrible! Do not buy this POS."
1.0,"Wish I could give it zero stars. The fabric is like a Halloween costume. I did NOT receive the shirt in the photo. I received a cheap, tacky version. Was so dissapointed."
1.0,I ordered plus size as I wear 14 and they did not fit at all. Going back. Too small.  :(
1.0,wore it every day since March and it broke not for every day wear
1.0,"This product is very misleading by the pictures and the description.  I mowed the lawn with one on and had to take it off as all it did is make me sweat more.  Got sweat in my eyes and these just do not work.  Buy terry cloth type.<br />Don' waist your time, $$ or anything on these.<br />I should get a refund."
1.0,"This fit my daughter awkwardly.  She has long legs, but according to the measurements, this should have fit.  One of the pockets was sewn mostly shut as well.  Not a good product."
1.0,These gloves are hideous.
1.0,"I wish I had looked at the reviews before I bought this. I ordered this in a Medium, and it is the size of a Small leaning towards an Extra Small. It is very thin and see through. It was a struggle getting it over my boobs and hips, and was VERY unflattering when I did.  It is not baggy like the picture shows, and the belt on it is detached. If I wanted it to fit like the picture I should have ordered a XXL."
1.0,Material is REALLY cheap and poor quality
1.0,Super small! I'm 5 foot 2 and 110 couldn't wear it ever
1.0,You get what you pay for with this dress. It was very stretchy. I bought a small and it was still too large on me. There are adjustable straps unlike what is stated in the product description. The material was not quality. It resembled the material of a Halloween costume. Additionally on the back by the zipper was a brown stain. Don't waste your money.
1.0,See through material. Very cheap looking.
1.0,"I put them in the laundry, just the bandanas and a pair of socks. I knew the socks would absorb colour, but wasn't expecting odd stains.  However, that isn't why they get one star.  They all shrunk in the wash, but not evenly, so most of them can't be folded neatly.  They were washed in cold water, with a medium dryer setting.  Over half of them came out of the dryer frayed, some have even started to unravel.  I had fairly moderate expectations for these, but I did expect them to survive one wash intact. If you just want a dozen bandanas that are bright, pretty colours (except for the brown one) and don't care if they're sturdy, get these. But if you want something reliable, look elsewhere."
1.0,"So terribley awful! Maybe I bought a size too big.. but regardless, after you wash them they look like crap! They are nothing like the picture. Don’t waste your money!!"
1.0,Had to return.  Too small for Note 3.
1.0,"Terrible product.<br />I don't know how there is positive reviews. I clean my glasses, i spray my glasses, i gently wipe away the spray, let dry,  and they still fog just as easy.<br />This is a glasses cleaner at best.<br />Do not waste your money."
1.0,Product ran small to size and was very stiff and uncomfortable.  Sole of boot was very stiff and was not cushioned as I remember moon boots to be.. Will be returning product.
1.0,"The gold color earrings turn an ugly brass color. It started turning the first time I worn them! They said I could shipped them back for a refund as the first time I brought them in original condition, so I had to be stuck with brass color earrings!"
1.0,Great material but entirely too small. Off by at least two sizes.
1.0,Scarf had a hole in it
1.0,I had to return this because it would fit a C cup maybe and I ordered an DDD. I also ordered 44 and it was like a 36.  Mislabled?  Who knows but even my roomate was too big for it so I had to just return it.
1.0,I bought plenty of pairs of these.The last 2 pair i bought for my sister and niece when they rec them they were  both scratched all up. Havent tlk to my sister in a couple of werks niece was hurt.
1.0,Piece of junk. I did like the fact you could adjust the ear loops. There was NO metal on the nose bridge to adjust on nose for tighter fit. It’s one FLIMSY layer. Don’t waste your money on this JUNK.
1.0,"Wasn’t sure about getting my normal size or if to size up like some people had suggested. Decided to size up since I have a sizable bottom. So.. I was able to get them on BUT the areas where they stretched out a bit more turned white. The print was a different faded looking color on those areas which was extremely unflattering. Would not even wear them at home. Also, the package I received seemed to have been from a return. It didn’t look like new packaging."
1.0,demasiado largo la tela que tiene por dentro demasiado corto
1.0,"I should  return  it ,but don't  feel like the hassle!"
1.0,The ear rings are to thick where it goes into the ear. It’s painful to put in. Don’t buy this product especially if you have small ear holes.
1.0,False advertising.  Price was enough to tell this was a scam but I gave it the benefit of doubt.  Earrings can not be used the picture advertised isn’t close to what I received total JUNK!  Buy a small cup of coffee instead & don’t be FOOLED!!!!! Shame on Amazon for posting this worthless product…
1.0,Broke withing an hour of wearing... Would show all chains broken but was walking to the park and didn't realize the chain holding all three together broke. Waste!!!
1.0,Too stretchy. I would have to be a couple of sizes smaller to work properly.
1.0,"I got an 8 and I was so excited to get them, for them to finally come and they are so tight that they cut up the back of my ankles :("
1.0,These were SO tight. I couldn't believe it. Sizing completely off. I wound up returning.
1.0,"The bracelet is so cute, so I'm disappointed that after one day of wear the gold coating on the chain faded and turned an unattractive brown. The gems are still in place and shiny as ever, but now it's a brown rust like coating instead of gold. Not great quality for it to fade so fast.<br />UPDATE: broke after one week. The chain snapped in half, and I wasn't even tugging on it. Very disappointed."
1.0,Seemed like a decent belt... then i removed it and it left stains where it came into contact with the clothing. The stains do not come out... China
1.0,The material was really thin it looked like a cheaply made oversized T-shirt.
1.0,Few hours in the pool and they started coming apart.
1.0,The dress looks nothing like the picture. They need to remove this item material is cheap dress doesn’t hang on the floor . Very disappointed will not purchase again . We’ll be returning for a refund
1.0,This shirt runs way way small!  It looks pretty cheaply made and am dsending it back for sure!
1.0,Dont do it!
1.0,The product is soft and stretchy just not made well. I ordered two pairs. One in Blue and one in olive. The blue arrived with a hole in it and loose thread
1.0,I ordered a Blue A6 Jiu Jitsu Gi and all I got were 2 solid black large t-shirts
1.0,"Came with crystal missing. Liked the earrings, but you get what you pay for, is true with this purchase. Needless to say, I returned them."
1.0,Way bigger than ear and didnt fit comfortably and looked terriable. Do not waste your money
1.0,"Again, I am very disappointed in this handbag purchase. This is the third handbag I have bought from Amazon and I will not order one again. The description is misleading. This was way too small. Definitely not adult sized. I should have learned my lesson the first two times. Plus it would cost more to ship back than what I have already spent."
1.0,El material de muy malísima  calidad benia descocido de cuello nada que ver con el de la foto
1.0,It’s a peach color - it will not go with any of my clothing . Does not match the description .
1.0,"The product has a very strong, distinctive, noxious odor. Also, the print looks cheap and like it would scratch off easily"
1.0,"I thought shirt would be mor fitted, it’s loose and doesn’t fit as expected"
1.0,Tremenda porquería. Dice q es oro blanco  de 18 kil y hasta las orejas se me pusieron color verdes. Las compre en Abril 2021 no llevan 6 meses y están horibles. Es una falta de respeto q  traten de cojer a uno de bobo.
1.0,Cheaply made - I broke after just sliding in and out of the watch a couple times. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"Cup size D and up, do not get. Had to take it off at a party because it kept unsticking. It does not lift the girls. I am very skinny too so size doesn't matter. 5'8 123lbs."
1.0,"Poor quality, very thin, looks like cardboard, different than picture"
1.0,"zipper broke within a week, nice design poor function--returned it"
1.0,"Got a t-shirt not a tank top. Totally disappointed, needed a tank top for this weekend"
1.0,Didn't want them
1.0,Hated them gave them away
1.0,"Very frail wire. Beautiful,  but cheap"
1.0,Did not fit my girlfriend it say that it can fit all them different size but it don't. Trash 🗑
1.0,This isn't cotton. It's a crappy material that's almost see through. I could've made the same one out of wrapping paper. 😂 It's a JOKE!
1.0,The glasses are very small in all dimensions even for my small face
1.0,The outfit falls apart fast. No instructions.
1.0,"I have 2 other tops exactly like this in other colors.  I normally would not do this, but I was so disappointed!  The top had obviously been worn and then returned.  There were no tags it, the brand tag had been cut out and it spelled funny.  I finally decided it had been washed and it was some kind of detergent I was smelling.  All 3 tops I have ordered in XL.  The first 2 fit great!  This one was a little snug, maybe they shrunk it.  I needed this for an event within 2 days so I didn't return, but I am extremely upset that this couldn't have been checked out when it was returned.  Otherwise a very nice top."
1.0,I did not receive what is pictured.  I received a lace one with bell sleeves.
1.0,the glasses showed up but 2 of them have missing screws.
1.0,Reindeer are WAY too small.
1.0,returned.  Was so so big!
1.0,"These are so cute, but I have 2 major issues<br />1) They are impossible to put on<br />2) Once they are on, they don’t stay on properly, and it’s hard for my toddler to walk in them"
1.0,"The masks I received in the mail are not the ones shown in the listing. They don't have the design that allows it to rest on the nose, so they'll constantly be slipping off, and they're not large enough to wrap under the chin to provide any meaningful protection. This is straight up deceit and I'm kinda surprised that Amazon is allowing this item to be sold since I'm not the first review to say this."
1.0,Way too large to be a lapel pin.  Basically it's useless and unusable.  It was misrepresented not sure what to do with it now.
1.0,Ok so buyers beware it’s supposed to be 110 pieces ummm no it was 65 pieces no backs on at least 24 and definitely for aftercare what pieces I did receive! I wouldn’t recommend it to an enemy
1.0,characters were repeated not much of a variety
1.0,OK if you don't need a real hood on your hoodie!
1.0,Very small but pretty.
1.0,"Dress is good material and fits well. However, it smells terrible and am not sure I will be able to wear it as it smell like cat food/fish. I hung it in my laundry room and smelled up the whole room. I am afraid to spray anything like fabric spray on it but at this point it can’t get any worse. If the wedding I am in wasn’t so soon I would return."
1.0,I know it is cheap costume jewelery but it is more copper colored than gold.
1.0,the gold plating rubbed off within a couple days and the clasps are super cheap and don’t work that well
1.0,Not a good fit and fabric is too stiff
1.0,They broke after a couple wears. And they are super huge..too big for the average human face I feel... wish I would’ve saved my money
1.0,"The color is a light blue/grey depending the light, not the pretty navy blue pictured. I ordered a 3x like the fitting chart stated, it's too tight and does not fit in the breast area. The material feels cheap and itchy. The elastic in the outfit is very uncomfortable and you can feel it immediately upon putting it on."
1.0,Worse quality I’ve ever seen-could have bought these at Dollar General
1.0,Feels cheap zipper broke after a few weeks.<br />Stay away from this back pack
1.0,See what I ordered vs what I got.<br /><br />Total false advertising. Will be making a complaint.
1.0,"This also didn't look as new as I wanted it too & I kept another navy handbag with the features of outside zip pocket, top zip pocket AND an outside open pocket."
1.0,"It's not well made; not sweatshirt material. I was very disappointed. I returned it. Also, the color was off."
1.0,The product was faulty and came damaged. Communications were ignored. Something for the kids to play with them throw away
1.0,You get what you pay for....disappointing
1.0,"These for around the waist but are way too short.<br />So they’re high waters, may go better with tall boots to cover the child’s ankles."
1.0,Very disappointed in dress.  It was not called a t-shirt when I bought it.  Was a gift and can't give this inferior dress to her
1.0,Super blurry image on front
1.0,"Not normal ""sweat"" pants. Its a silky polyester material. The print does not line up. Poorly made!  Would not recommend."
1.0,"Very pretty and I went down a size like some people recomended so it fit well.  The first time I put it on my husband noticed a small hole.  It took it off and unzipped it to sew it.  When I went zip it up ( mind you im not wearing it at this point)  the zipper bused.  So, i removed the zipper and sewed the sides together.  Luckly i can get it on and off without the zipper!"
1.0,This belt does not fit a 34in waist as it says it will. It will only close so far. Description is wrong. Returning
1.0,"I like the style for work, but one broke off after one day of wearing."
1.0,This items does not work at all. The magnet does not connect.
1.0,"Did not like the fit. Am a size 10 and ordered XL in boyfriend style for comfort and looseness as one would want in pajamas. The waist comes around my hips below my belly button and the crotch area is very tight. For the price, I was very disappointed. Not sure why a pajama Jean would not have a high rise fit. Plus they are too short."
1.0,"Very cheaply made, flimsy and took a long time to arrive. Save your money"
1.0,"It doesn't stick, I got this case all excited and I stick it to the mirror and my phone dropped and shattered. Not that I'm really surprised haven't had much luck with amazon. Don't buy this case cuz they don't work."
1.0,"Look cheap,,"
1.0,It broke within a week. Cheap
1.0,Did not work..... after many coats. I returned this one and  I bought a cheaper product on amazon with better luck
1.0,"BAD ZIPPER - I bought this for my husband for Christmas, first one fit to small (I ordered his normal size), sent it back and ordered a size larger than he normally is - fits fine.  He has had this coat for one month  and the zipper has failed already.  There are not a lot of options for longer coats for men - so I took a chance on this one.  He wore  this 3-4 times a week for one month and it's broken.  If I could send it back I would - one month and $50 was not well spent."
1.0,These run very small and they’re also quite thin. I really wanted to like these but my two complaints make that impossible.
1.0,"Purchased for my mother. Product is made of cheap material, nothing like photo. Followed sizing and was still way too big in the arm holes. Shipping was very fast though.<br />Would have been fine to not leave a negative review but upon checking my email found a message from the store essentially asking me leave a positive review as they have too much inventory and cannot be stuck with it in exchange for something free."
1.0,"Key chain arrived with pieces falling out.  Large stone was at bottom of the bag along with one of the tiny stones missing.  Metal and design was nice.  Such a disappointment.  I would have glued the large stone back myself but when I saw smaller stone missing, I was not having it.  Back it goes."
1.0,Cheap looking. The ropes are not seperated and you can see the metal underneath. Cheap looking.
1.0,Kaki color is not light kaki like picture.  It's a mustard tan color.  Had to return.  Fits was good though. And comfortable.
1.0,These are beyond poorly made! I didn’t even get to take one step!! I literally put them on they looked nice but then I put my foot on the floor and this happened!!! Heel broke completely!!! Thankful that I didn’t take a step!!! Totally disappointed ☹️
1.0,They did not fit! I usually wear a small and ordered a medium and it is still too small.
1.0,"Este producto no me llegó, y en la página dice que ha sido entregado, porfavor comunicarse con migo.<br />(321)9487766 Miguel Guevara"
1.0,I got bought the mediums and received larges. They don’t stay on my nose or fit my face.
1.0,"Received early, item looks like pictures,  haven't worn yet, I'll have to untangle before I can wear them.<br /><br />I've untangled them.....and guess what?  They don't fit!  I'll probably give them to my daughter. ....not worth the effort sending back"
1.0,Way too small for my liking!
1.0,I was very disappointed in this outfit. It was way too small. I ordered an extra large it was the size of an extra small. I should have her read the reviews first
1.0,Incredibly short. My breast were not held up or inside ...kept falling out the bottom. Cheap material
1.0,"The coat delivered isn't even close to the sizes represented in sizing charts, and the pictures show the hem being several inches lower than the sleeve length.  In reality the sleeve is even with the hem. This is hardly a parka, but a hooded jacket at a high cost, with the smell of bait & switch."
1.0,Very cheaply made.. nothing like the picture.. disappointed
1.0,Tiny!!!!  Small by at least 3 sizes. I usually wear a size medium or woman size 6/8. I ordered a large and it fits my daughter who wears a girls size 10/12.
1.0,"I hated this item! Very thin, and didn't look like the picture"
1.0,Very thin material and not very long as expected
1.0,"I bough a large in green and it seems like a 4XL its tight on the bottom. but huge on the waist and crotch it is just wrong. There is no stretch, no compression at all, not tummy control as it say it does. You do not see any tags inside of the legging, does not know the materials. The stitches are loose in some parts, horrible. My worst purchase ever. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,Reused shipping package and product arrived 1/4 used. See photos.
1.0,Super disappointed with this bag. I hadnt carried it even a month and the stitching on the zipper started coming undone. Then it started becoming unattached from the bag itself. Was very upset because I loved the looks of this bag. Id love for them to send me a different one and Id send this one back.
1.0,"These were way to small, had to get rid of them."
1.0,This thing is tiny. It would work fine for a small child.
1.0,"If you are concerned about rejection and/or infection, then do not buy this or any jewelry that is not 316L steel or titanium. Also, if you do not know what gauges go in what piercing, then consult a professional piercer."
1.0,I just received my order and it's a 5 pack???! This is false advertising.
1.0,Thin cheap material you can see through the dress. It's a cute style I had high hopes.
1.0,"I purchase this product last year, but star using it just last month and is already tearing a part, poor quality, is losing the rubber that should seal the air to get into your ices"
1.0,Very cheaply made. Looks cheap. Not worth the price despite its affordability.
1.0,This product was so small. It is not at all as it was described. Do not waste your time or money.
1.0,Yes. This dress is as bad as all the other reviews. The little plastic loop on holding one side broke when I went to adjust the strap.
1.0,Inconsistent sizes. One looks like it would fit a doll.
1.0,"After a few months the ""metal"" clasp dissolved and created a green/brown spot on my wrist. Spend the money and get a real one made from higher quality metal."
1.0,"One of them didn’t work, so I had to return them.  On top of that, one of them had a big scratch on it.  I was really bummed because I was looking forward to getting them."
1.0,"Soft and comfortable, shame on me for not looking at the material"
1.0,"When I got these one of the ends were chipped and the other crystal fell off before I could wear them. I tried gluing the pieces together and they ended up looking crooked. I was super excited to get these as they were half the price from another retailer, unfortunately I feel like I got about half the quality too."
1.0,TERRIBLE FIT & quality.
1.0,it broke first time she wore it!
1.0,The dress just didn't sit right no matter how many ways were tried
1.0,"These expensive underwear are of poor quality. I've worn them once and the elastic waist band is already fraying. Stay away, use your money of cheaper, higher quality underwear!"
1.0,Not at all like the photo. Very thick and not attractive on.
1.0,This was not good my nose is currently having a burning feeling ive washed my nose. I wont be wearing this anymore. Which sucks because of the price so now im not getting my money worth
1.0,Look and fit nothing like the picture
1.0,These arrived with 2 out of 4 pairs of earrings broken and unrepairable. Very unhappy.
1.0,"After one day of wear, the material pilled and wore off.<br />Had to be thrown away."
1.0,Really big for a small.
1.0,"Runs small, colors not as nice as pictured, material has a shine to it. Returned"
1.0,"Cute, but the post came out of the earring after a week and I had to super glue it back together"
1.0,The material wasnt very good and it came already snagged. I am sending it back to order something different. The picture did look accurate though
1.0,"I wear an 11.  So since house shoes ordered these larger, a 12.  Too small still.  Nice shoes, just not true to size, dont fit at all, waste of time and money."
1.0,"I ordered 2-3 sizes larger than my usual size. The shirt almost fit, but the sleeves are way long, and the shirt is too short."
1.0,"Zippers on first pair I received didn’t work so had to return the item. The second pair had functioning but poor quality zippers, which catch and seemed ready to fail before even wearing. I’d recommend not buying this item."
1.0,This braclet is poorly made. Junk!
1.0,"Worn it once while hiking on a marked and groomed trail. It kept me dry for the hike, but the seams ripped out badly during light useage. Unable to wear a second time."
1.0,"Llegó muy bien embalado para decir que se partió en el trayecto. La mica demasiado partida y la correa en la foto se veía marrón y es negra. Terrible!!! Como estoy en Venezuela el reloj llegó tiempo después de poder hacer un reclamo, lo cual no es justo. Agregue una foto para que aprecien mejor las condiciones en las que llegó el reloj! Lo quería dar como regalo especial en diciembre y estoy muy decepcionada."
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this purchase, the picture is very deceiving, the color is off, it reminds me of a cheaply made curtain... Was very disappointed in this purchase and when I tried to return it they offered me 40% of my purchase price."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Sandal was ripped straight out of the box. Normally love Bebe but this one is a total miss<br />.Keep shopping
1.0,Not as pictured.  Very cheap looking. Returned it prior to June 1. Still waiting for refund!!!
1.0,"Very thin, would be better used as tights and not work out gear.  Also, these make me very itchy. Since I've worn them and washed them, I don't think I can return. Therefore, I'm giving them to Goodwill."
1.0,"This was so disappointing. It was sewn completely crooked and could not be worn and was not a good fit anyways... when I first opened it I was excited be because it looked cute and I bought this to wear to a wedding last second. It gapped at The chest which is odd because I am a 34D...then I turned around and the back of the dress looked ridiculous. The lining is sewn crooked and bunched up in the back. The overlay lace was literally cut uneven on one side, as you can see in the picture. It was extremely noticeable and overall a terrible purchase... returning :("
1.0,"Fell apart first day I tried to wear it, fixed it but then it turned my ankle green. I needed it for a beach wedding I was in. I will be returning it."
1.0,not a 4x
1.0,After just a could of washings the stitching all over the sweatshirt is falling apart.  Would not buy again.
1.0,Item comes with no instructions in English (that would have been helpful to know before ordering it) It was placed in the freezer.  It froze solid.  It did not ever cease being solid and does not cool.  BUYER BEWARE.  I am completely displeased with this product in every way.
1.0,Fabric looks washed out and it's wat to small!  I'm from the USA 🇺🇸 and I think the Chinese may size around their smaller people. Very disappointing!!
1.0,The pin is broken ! No sharp tip to pin through clothing !!!
1.0,"Was happy when I received it but not more than 15 minutes after I put it on, there was small snag from a piece of paper.  A PIECE OF COPY PAPER?!  When I tried to straighten it out, the fabric is so thin, that just gently pulling on the fabric made holes under my fingers.  I've never seen such a thing,  Beware of this shirt or wear it in a bubble."
1.0,"Not good, you will realise once receive the product"
1.0,"Bad quality, the color changed.. My daughter can't wear it anymore,, it caused infection to her ear"

1.0,Do not bother wasting your time or money on these el cheapo glasses. You cannot see a thing wearing these. The lenses are a super cheap plastic. You are better off walking around with your eyes closed. You have been warned!
1.0,The material was awful!
1.0,"Don’t wash this shirt in a home washing machine. Even on cold temp and delicate cycle, the shirt shrank to the point where it’s now far too small. Really poor quality for any shirt brand, but especially a RL polo. Not the quality I’m used to that’s for certain."
1.0,Broke after half hour
1.0,not happy with them at all.........they tarnish immediately & seem very poorly made!  CHEAP!!!

1.0,"Ordered my regular size for boots , 9, and these are way too narrow and small in length , my toes crammed in."

1.0,They were comfy and looked great but my daughter was crying because the shoes split open at the bottom and started talking and she was embarrassed
1.0,These socks are so tight they left indignation’s on my leg ankle and foot. The colors are great but so disappointed. I can not wear them
1.0,These are really cool! I love the design.  Unfortunately they provide absolutely no protection from covid as you can easily blow a lighter out. They are too thin.<br />I guess I can wear them in the summer to protect me from the sun. Otherwise as cool as they are they are worthless.
1.0,"So disappointed in this product, was expected much better quality, ...more like thin cheese cloth...runs extremely small.<br />It was so pretty in the photo.<br />Total waste of money... (minus ☆☆☆☆☆)"
1.0,"Super cheap plastic,  it was even glued in crooked."
1.0,The ones I got weren’t even curved. They were just straight and yeah they’re pretty big. Returning.
1.0,It didn't fit.  I ordered a 42 waist and was too small.  All my current pants size are 42 regular and has been that for years.  Please don't tell me that I have put on extra weight.  I can still wear my current pants which are all 42 regular.
1.0,This product has loose parts instead of glued on. It is not what I ordered and I can’t wear it. I need to get a refund.
1.0,Hilos jalados y ojal de cinta arrancado.
1.0,Not a good fit. Bad proportions around the neck & shoulders. I’m a typical size medium and couldn’t salvage the purchase.
1.0,"did not match description, the picture on the t shirt is not a picture of neptune"
1.0,The straps don’t come attached nor able to clip on must be knotted but this shortens the length of the straps which defeats the purpose of the crossbody style
1.0,Did not have the Akery label. No label at all. Fits very small not pleased at all. Product discription stated to let them know if there was no label.
1.0,Way too small. Cheap material.  Took about 2 months to arrive.  I gave it away instead trying to mail it back to China.
1.0,It fit but looked weird...not as nice as I was expecting....returning for a refund
1.0,"Ring was not attachef when we received it,she chose to wear the bracelet anyway it came apart five minutes after she put it on."
1.0,2-3 sizes too small
1.0,"This product was not at all worth the money.  The seller refused to pay for shipping to return the item and to return this cheaply made watch is more than the watch itself.  I am going to find a child to give this ""TOY"" to for Christmas."
1.0,Says laser engraved... After the first day in my pocket more than half of the bear has rubbed away. Seems more like printed on with cheap black ink. Really disappointed. Will be returning ASAP.
1.0,"Pretty, runs slightly small in my opinion, but wasn't able to keep it because of how wrinkly the material was. All it takes is sitting down once for it to crease and stay that way in a million places, looks cheap and messy. Dress was also too big everywhere on me except the shoulders, which were still trying to ride up, if I had gotten a size smaller the shoulders wouldn't have stayed down at all."
1.0,"item was packaged so tightly that once i removed it from the packaging, I could not get the wrinkles out of the outfit, so I had to return and how it was made you could see directly through the lower part of the dress and I didn;t know until now that it supposed to have had a headband and bracelet which was not in my package."
1.0,There are two sizes of adult goggles and these were for small faces; nothing in the description mentions that.
1.0,Pink overlay fabric isn’t sewn at all on the sides so the shorts don’t lay nicely or wear nicely at all when walking or moving. Not impressed and would not recommend these.
1.0,"I ordered these because I'm going on a 3 month long trip and wanted my sunglasses easily accessible. The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the smell. They smelled so terrible, worse than just a factory/freshly finished product smell. So I soaked them in laundry detergent and water overnight hoping that would work. It made absolutely no difference. Secondly, they are too short. If worn, my sunglasses would be right below my neck, making them difficult to even pull up to my face. So I decided to return them and ended up buying the kind I wanted from Wal-Mart. Despite the fact that it cost less to ship them here, I would actually have to pay $1 more then the ENTIRE AMOUNT of what initially I paid to return them. What a ripoff. But what do you expect when you buy junk that is shipped from China? These will be going in the garbage, along with the money I wasted on them."
1.0,"If you know what Shell Pearls look like, do not buy these.  If you like hematite, this is a beautiful necklace."
1.0,"The zipper broke, very unhappy. I thought it was good but it broke yesterday,  didn't even have it week."
1.0,Cheap! Don't waste your money
1.0,"This was supposed to have bling/rhinestones.  Nothing!  Very disappointing, I didn't even try it on and it is going back."
1.0,What arrived was not what I ordered. Skirt was pretty but print was not what was featured.<br />Not sure what occurred.<br />I gave the skirt away.
1.0,I'm an avid beer drinker but I didn't recognize any of the bottle caps. Needed this for my bottle cap collection to hang in my beer themed home. This didn't work.  Do yourself a favor and head on down to the local bar and ask the bar tender for bottle caps instead.
1.0,These shoes broke the second time I wore them.
1.0,"Are these even real wax jeans? I’ve purchased 2 other wax pants in size 5 that fit perfectly (I’m 5’7, 123lbs) and these are way too short, super tight in the lower legs (I have skinny legs) and way baggy in the crotch/waist area. Complete garbage pants"
1.0,Came in with the feathers on plume broke! VERY DISAPPOINTING
1.0,Just wear the boots...dont worth ..dont buy it.
1.0,Material seemed cheap. Not worth the price
1.0,"The stitching is poor, the material is cheap, and the neck was actually sown twisted."
1.0,avoid
1.0,"Fabric was kinda cheap,  but i expected it. I didn't expecr for the fabric to have absolutely no stretch or room for anyone with boobs over size c cup. Gotta return this dress but if u have a smaller chest and understand the dress may not recover from a go in the wash machine, order away."
1.0,These are terrible. flimsy. I never got to try them as they broke already.  I never see something made so weak and flimsy. I don't have much to say bout other them cavet emptor.  buyer beware.
1.0,Dress is poorly designed and made. Dress arrived with not one but two holes in it - and a snag. The seams underneath were very ragged. Garbage. Extremely static material. Returning it.
1.0,Looks exactly like the picture but the sizing is way off!! An XL was tiny!
1.0,Cheaply made. Item returned
1.0,The fit horribly too small
1.0,This was completely see through very disappointed
1.0,Wore them once and put them in the box when going to wear them again they turned color waisted money
1.0,"I would like to share my fair opinion about this product.<br />It is not so expensive which is good but it has some disadvantages:<br />1. It has bad smell. You cannot wear it initially after unpacking because it has some plastic smell. I had to wash it. Therefore I think quality of fiber is not good. Maybe it is also dangerous for your skin. Be careful!!!<br />2. Size is not fit for me. I ordered L size but it was too small.<br />In this review I tried explained my opinion about this product which I think can be helpful for you, guys. My final result is not recommended. I hope Amazon will not delete my review because they sometimes are biased to some sellers."
1.0,Not what I expected.  Material to heavy for the VI.
1.0,"Ray-Bans have glass lenses and these are plastic so, not a good replacement. They fit alright but, not perfect. Sometimes they pull an eyebrow hair because of the gap between the lens and frame. For the money, I was expecting glass lenses and better quality."
1.0,The product broke very fast. The product did not stick to the shoe for long. They don’t work on high tops.
1.0,"Toe area to narrow, arch little high, Loved my Hoka One shoes, so comfortable, Gravity defyer hurts to put back on the next day. Dont mind the price, but not if they are to uncomfortable to wear. Taking them to the shoe cobbler to see if they can help me. Accidentally throughout the box, so didn't return. Definitely wouldn't buy again. I have regular to narrow feet, so was super Suprising they hurt my toes by squeezing them together, arch was not soft."
1.0,Did not look like picture at all
1.0,Cheap material and way too small for being unisex.
1.0,Beautiful but even so I up 2 size it still small
1.0,This isn’t described nor pictured a fluorescent pink with some blue and a bit of purple. This is almost entirely fluorescent and I’m not sure why the seller doesn’t describe it as such in photo with proper lighting and editing nor in words. “184-td pink” is fluorescent pink and not cutle like the one in the photo. It also has no royal blue as the photo shows.
1.0,"Low quality thin materials, you can see right through the pants.  Also, there is strange stitching across both knees.  Hoped to wear them while golfing and on casual days at the office.  I would never wear these anywere.  I have bought 2 pairs of Nylon & Spandex hiking pants and love both of them, hoped for the same quality with these but no way.  Will return them ASAP."
1.0,Small!!
1.0,Not what was pictured AT ALL😤😤😤
1.0,"Here's why I'm returning this dress:<br />1.  Fit is awful.  It just hangs like a sack.  I know it's supposed to be loose, but good grief!  It has no shape at all.<br />2.  I bought the ""tie-dyed"" color.  No, that's not tie-dyed.  It's color printed on at random intervals.<br />3.  The color:  The pastels are nice.  However, there are dark reddish-brown splotches of color all over that look like dried blood.  It looks like I was either in a terrible accident or just recently visited a crime scene.<br />Nope, this thing is going back."
1.0,Looks like something from wish! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,I returned the watch as it looked totally different from the picture in the website..  The  watch was cheap looking and looked like it came out of a gum ball machine.. A 1 star was too good for this product..I sent it back and will go elsewhere to purchase a watch..
1.0,Brim is not stiff at all and will not stay in place.  The other style I bought is terrific.
1.0,"I have loved it, if it was more large on the top"
1.0,"Parts of the fur are cut. It came with a safety pin holding the bottom together. The fur flops around,  im definately gonna have to use my gluegun to keep the fur in place. Wouldnt recommend them at all!"
1.0,"The title says it all. The links on the watch band come apart very easily. I've taken it to a professional jeweler twice and they can't get it to work either, so it's not just me. Since the watch falls off your arm when then links come apart, I wouldn't trust anything worth more than $50 to this band because it's going to hit the ground."
1.0,Extremely cheap- much worse quality than I was expecting
1.0,I would give this product a zero if I could. The necklace was broken and only part of it was even in the cellophane wrap. The part of the necklace that WAS in there was cheap looking. Item sent back immediately. Don't waste your time.
1.0,I thought this was a joke when I received it. It fot more like a T-shirt than a dress and was made out of very thin costume-like material.
1.0,"It's really cheap, dosnt compress anything, rolls up all the time and are alot shorter then they look"
1.0,The dress fit my granddaughter perfect and was beautiful for her “Father Daughter Dance” but the zipper came unsewn from the dress. We didn’t have time to order a new dress or to exchange it so we had to repair ourselves. Hopefully this was just a streak of bad luck on our part and the other dresses are better assembled.
1.0,Sadly the post broke first time I wore them. So now they are useless.
1.0,Looks nothing like picture. Not made with same material or design as shown. Poorly made for cost.
1.0,It arrived quickly. Unfortunately it has a horrible chemical smell. I can't wear it. The smell has made me physically ill.
1.0,Broke after a month. Thought silicone would be more durable.
1.0,"i buy gloves like these often. i do not like these particular ones. they are super thin and often break. even just putting them on is enough to cause them to break. also, the gloves run a bit shorter than the picture. the ones i got run only up to the wrist"
1.0,"I bought this for a Christmas present back in May, tested it and put it away until gift time. Checked it today (November) and it stopped working. Too late to get a refund......"
1.0,"The idea and pattern of this shirt is really cute, but the lace v-neck ordeal is just not there. It dips down way too low and looks weird with a tank top underneath. Unless you are wanting to show a whole bras worth of cleavage, I wouldn’t recommend this product. Just the way this shirt is designed isn’t practical. Not to mention, the material of the shirt is super scratchy, and just doesn’t feel good."
1.0,I didnt like it it was broken when i got it!! i do not say anyon should or shouldnt but it but i dont like it and the seller isnt friendly and asks for proof when you send a claim about it
1.0,"These are weirdly polyester and the strangest, cheapest material ever. Very uncomfortable."
1.0,"I was so excited about this product. I researched the outfit, I read the reviews, I even looked at the measurements. I was so geeked up for the Florida Classic weekend and no. Hunti, if you're even remotely fluffy in the center, hang it up. I was prepared to suck and tuck, but even spanx and a waist cincher weren't going to help. That zipper was faulty out of the package and this jumper has 0 stretch. Let me say it once more, 0 stretch. No give."
1.0,"the balls are fine. the posts get scratched up very easily, i'm talking my toothbrush messed them up and i use a soft one. (those scratches make them very hard to clean and they will gather dead skin and stuff which starts to smell. i cleaned them twice a day and they still got weird)"
1.0,Iy was unable didn't come with the pins returned
1.0,"I dont' know what is going on but I keep getting the wrong item. The case isn't shaped like a car and they have swim caps inside them and the googles are adult sized and just black. My son keeps asking for his and I can't understand why they have the wrong items labeled as kids swim goggles. Just look - it isn't a car shaped case, why is it so hard."
1.0,Demasiado pequeña la talla no concuerda gracias
1.0,It is not want it say it is like water proof not an they feel like your walking barefooted no comfort at all if I could seen them back I would
1.0,This product is NOT as pictured!  It is very cheap and flimsy.  It looks like something sold at the dollar store as a child’s toy! DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,"Plum color was true to size and cow neck seam was inward as it suppose to be.  This red one, on the other hand was smaller and cow neck seam was sewn inside out. Returning this one but keeping the plum colored one, because I loved it:)"
1.0,the size is not right
1.0,"Size too small, dissapointed. Don't look at all like the picture, was really looking forward to wearing these, but they are a definite no go...."
1.0,Junk!! Cheap Chinese crap!!<br />Don't do it.<br />I work on a paving crew.<br />The zipper broke in a week.<br /><br />Seriously it's crap!!<br />Bill
1.0,Most of the lights did not work.
1.0,This bonnet bleeds! My white pillow cases are stained
1.0,"One earring is broken, the pearl is missing and it isn’t in the packsge so the earring was already broken. The set is very beautiful if it weren’t for this detail."
1.0,The necklace chain was broken and the black bead was crushed when it arrived
1.0,Very poor sizing get 2 sizes bigger
1.0,Way too loose. Now I already have prescription lenses and am stuck with them.
1.0,Material was too stiff and small of opening with sandals unzipped at back of sandal to get her foot into shoe. Was disappointed because she really love them
1.0,"Una gran desepcion<br />Muy muy pequeño<br />No es ropa de mujer delgada , es para niñas que todavía no han desarrollado, ya no compraré productos si no son de Amazon<br />No deberían dejar que esta gente venda aca"
1.0,"All I've got left after one use is a scratchy hat with some nonfunctional electronics inside. During my one use I found that the bluetooth connectivity was fine if you've got your phone on your body, but if you walk a room away, it cuts out entirely."
1.0,"This dress is so big on me that i could gain 150 lbs. & it  would still be big. AMAZON, this is a small?????"
1.0,These did absolutely NOTHING towards their stated purpose.  Completely useless.  Returned immediately.  In all my use of Amazon only twice have I returned anything for this reason.  Don’t waste your time.
1.0,"This dress is very stretchy, however it looks cheap and it is made cheap. When the wrap is inserted you can see the hole if you lift your arms. A spank is needed or you will be loose underneath. The color is like the picture but it is not as sparkly as pictured. Overall I do not recommend this dress."
1.0,This jacket is horrible too thin not what I thought I was paying for and is not figure flattering. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There is nothing really to keep warm a sweater is warmer than this. Please do not buy it. A waste of time and money
1.0,This material is as thin as a tshirt.
1.0,Not durable. I bought this as a  birthday gift to my boyfriend. After 2 months the inside and rubber sole started peeling off. It reminded me of wet cardboard. Will not buy again.
1.0,does not stick to the screen of phone and comes off.not a good choice to buy again .
1.0,We bought these shoes for my 6 year old son.  This is the photo after 16 days of wear.  Nice looking shoes but they do not hold up to an active little boy.
1.0,Do not feel like bamboo socks! They feel like cheap polyester imposters. If you are a bamboo sock owner and lover these are NOT the size CJ's for you!! Do Not Buy!
1.0,So cheaply made that the seam on one of the shoes tore after only 3 wearings. Soles are hard and slippery. Very poor quality. I wouldn't even donate them to charity - but maybe as a dog chew toy!
1.0,"MADE MY EARS BREAKOUT, HAD TO RETURN"
1.0,The sizes is soooo baad I get 3T but it's seems like 6-12 month max
1.0,If you only carry 2-3 cards this is ok I guess. My son carries 4 plus DL.  His wife took it to use when she doesn't want to carry a purse. A lot of money WASTED!!!!!
1.0,We were excited to use these for a Pennies for Patients fundraiser at our school. When the bracelets arrived there were too many that were mishapen and not in a circle that fit comfortably over the wrist. Once on the wrist there were bulges. Kids were asking for a refund of their money or to exchange for a different bracelet.
1.0,It was to wide but too short. Sad
1.0,The graphic is blurry.
1.0,"I thought these were going to be great and a cute earring back, but after using them for a time, I find they are a waste of money.  The first few I tried were way too loose for my earring post.  I kept trying to find two that were tight.  I finally did, but I nearly lost an earring this morning :-(  It seems that they don't hold their shape at all.  I will chalk this up as a lesson learned and will buy another product instead (like the ones I had before that were tight and held their shape)."
1.0,"THe snap that links the band broke and fell off after less than 90 days in service (purchased July 1, 2021 and the snap broke on Sept 18, 2021----trying to get a replacement or credit"
1.0,The shoes are not true to size.
1.0,They fit loose on the back of my feet and the left pedal has a pop at 6 o’clock. It’s driving me nuts. We’ve tried adjusting them and the bike shop said they were junk..
1.0,The ring was gorgeous but within the first day the gem in the center fell out. I can’t believe it broke so quickly. I’m super disappointed and honestly quite pissed. Seems stupid to spend money on something that won’t even last five minutes. Would NEVER recommend!!!!!
1.0,"After two washes, a huge hole developed in the crotch of these pants. Don't waste your time or money."
1.0,I bought and they run extremely small.
1.0,Doesn't stay latched onto the watch. Fell off within 10 minutes of wearing it every time. Don't purchase.
1.0,"After reading the reviews, they were all positive for the most part, only one had a minor issue with the size. I usually wear 18/20 so I decided to size up to a 3X- it fit my SMedium size daughter perfectly and she doesn’t even need shape wear. So I don’t know where mine went wrong in size. All other posts purchased the nude, I decided to go with the black. So maybe it was the color as to why my size was completely off (yes I’m being sarcastic)"
1.0,Cute but very poor fabric (not absorbent) for an apron
1.0,"Pretty abalone, but the chain broke within 3 hours of putting it on."
1.0,I disliked the fact that they are not the jeans pictured!!
1.0,"BAD FIT, CHEAPLY MADE. GET WHAT CHA PAY FOR, WAS A HORRIBLE PURCHASE"
1.0,"Misleading size. Gave this short, little poncho to my 11 year old daughter. This poncho does not fit ladies only girls."
1.0,"With all the restrictions this item is NO RETURN. The dress has a lot of wrinkles and i would like to wash and see how it washes and if the wrinkles will wash out and dry ok. But with so many restrictions, this item allow returning. I like what i see but cant try it on nor wash it."
1.0,"Both posts were bent, & the earrings look like they have tarnish spots on them."
1.0,Not stealing silver
1.0,Size down your order.  The pattern was too busy for the cut of the dress.  I returned it
1.0,"This has to be the most frustrating purchase I've made in years. Set on it's tightest configuration, it is still too big for my wrist and slides a good two inches up/down every time I move my arm. Not a good enough fit to reliably use the heart rate sensor on the watch.<br /><br />But you don't actually discover this until you've spent the better part of an hour figuring out how to adjust the band to begin with. There are three different clamps you have to open and move, and it isn't intuitive how to do at least one of them.  An instruction sheet would be helpful, but apparently the profit margins on this product are so small that the company can't afford to spring for a photocopied half sheet of paper with instructions.<br /><br />I have another band on order. When it comes tomorrow, this one goes back where it came from."
1.0,"Not pre-shrunk. The first time I washed and dried, they ended up shrinking from a large to a very tight medium. Also, the quality was horrible. Strings randomly hanging from production, small holes in the seams and the seams weren't straight at all. VERY, very unsatisfied."
1.0,Unfortunately this specific pattern is completely see through. I returned it because I was so disappointed at the lack of quality material.
1.0,"Fits as expected, if you order L you will receive US L.<br /><br />The good: The pattern is really nice.<br />The bad: Because of the thin stretchy material, even if the item is big enough, it looks too small and there are huge gaps between the buttons.<br /><br />I am 100% sure that the picture has been tampered with or they stitched it together before they took it. Or it's a different item altogether, the one I received does not have the pocket you see on the picture.<br /><br />I'll keep this and either cut off the top or stitch the lower part together and remove the top button."
1.0,Literally took it out of box and a jewel popped off. Very cheap!
1.0,The latch broke off within 5 minutes of wearing it the first time. Remember $1 means its probably as cheap made as it costs! Lesson learned
1.0,It was smaller than expected and the metal was flimsy and cheap. Not even remotely worth the money.
1.0,"I’m almost certain these are a kids large, nice and soft but not to true to size"
1.0,Good Grief!  The mask is so tight that it's about ready to pull my ears off!  The beard is staight across below the nose. not curved like the picture.
1.0,Lost about 2mins per day.
1.0,Thought this was an actual dogearred necklace (should have known by the price) you get what u pay for. Cheap / knock off - very disappointing
1.0,"This was a complete waste of money.  It is definitely made for a child, not a woman."
1.0,"The pattern was spot on to the picture. When it arrived it is super thin material. I could see through the whole dress, top to bottom, especially once I was outside on a sunny day. This would either need to be a swim cover up or you would need a slip.<br /><br />I wear a size 10 and 38D, the medium was a great fit."
1.0,the bracelets shows red on the pictures and is described as red but is actually pink. I didn't place the order incorrect because there isn't an option for pink. If you want red bracelets don't buy them from here. Besides that the bracelets are beautiful but not the color I want or expected. If you want pink then get them. They are beautiful.
1.0,Pretty color but way too small
1.0,I have written to the email provided on the card and today is day 3 no response. Earrings arrived missing a stone and one has a substance on the hoop part. Sending back.
1.0,No one would buy this off the rack if they saw it.  Big mistake.  Disproportionate and terrible fabric.  Do not waste your money.  Sending mine back just for principle.
1.0,I returned. I wear a 36 D and this bra was way too small!
1.0,I tried to use it multiple times in different situations yet none of them worked I ended up pulling my shoes out just as they were to begin with but just wet
1.0,"The boots we received were not orange , more of pink tone. Secondly we also got a used pair! Not new has requested, so we returned them."
1.0,the fabric is awful
1.0,"Hoop earings were not what I was expecting.  Bought them for my wife and they were way too heavy.  They are not silver and if they are, they do not say it anywhere on the earings themselves or in the ad or website."
1.0,Magnet didn’t work on my uniform
1.0,These are extremely lightweight and rather useless.
1.0,The description says oversized xl aviators. They are kids size the ears pieces don't even reach behind my ears they are literally youth or child glasses.
1.0,Product looked completely different than advertised.
1.0,Faded and cracked  after 1st wear.  Horrible shoe!!!
1.0,"So cheap material, not sit on your face very good."
1.0,"My 8 year old is having a school dance so I let her pick out shoes and a dress and she picked these shoes. From a distance they look stunning with lots of sparkles. However, if you look close you'll notice alot of imperfections and it appears as if the shoes are held together with super glue. And Cheap super glue, at that. Also, it runs a size small so order up, if you MUST buy.  I hope she gets one dance out of this shoe before it comes unglued  If her heart wasn't set on this particular shoe I'd return it."
1.0,"I have never, ever felt compelled to write a review. These are not waterproof gloves no matter what you have read."
1.0,Too small no good
1.0,"Poor quality material , had to throw the shirt away"
1.0,"Good Morning, I rarely leave reviews, but thought I would share this one.  My son and I each purchased one of these bands. They looked great, but they snap off your watch face with the slightest pressure.  My son sails and his 15$ band and $600 atch is at the bottom of the lake.  I laughed it off, but felt bad for him. 2 days later while working in my garage my band snaps off.  I'm ordering a new band this am.. this one is going in the garbage. DO NOT LOSE your $600 watch because of these cheap, faulty bands."
1.0,I sent it back. Poor zipper and straps falling off
1.0,"Considering the price tag on this necklace, I would have expected a nicer piece of jewelry.  Some of the silver beads were tarnished.  There was so much space on the chain it looked like beads were missing. The clasp was cheap.  Only the lobster claw on one end and a tiny little loop on the other, not the kind of closure you would expect.  I will definitely be sending this necklace back. I could have purchased this at Walmart or Target all day long in the costume jewelry section for $20."
1.0,I have Ordered Numbers Before And They Came With Pens ! ! !
1.0,Was way to small. Fits more like a crop top vs the slouchy sweater pictured.
1.0,"Like a bad Aprils Fools Joke, never happen!"
1.0,One of the cufflinks fell apart the first time I put them on.  The black insert fell out.  Very poor quality.  Be warned.
1.0,"The sweatshirt was advertised as Liquid Blue, which tends to make high quality, durable shirts. The sweatshirt I received, however, was not Liquid Blue but rather a cheap generic brand. I'm not a ""name brand only"" person by any means, but I just really enjoy Liquid Blue's materials, quality, durability, etc. Wound up sending it back."
1.0,"poorly made, and way too large for a small"
1.0,worth the entire 99 cents
1.0,"Finish edge on handles peeled off....was so ready for this bag as I have always wanted a Michael Kors, but disappointed with that piece of it....I will say the seller handled my return professionally and it was hassle free."
1.0,Glasses scratched first time I cleaned them with tissue
1.0,Very small!!! A 2xl is like a medium... but if it did fit it would be cute
1.0,it broke within a week not pleased at all
1.0,The photo is very deceiving as to the size. It is minuscule.
1.0,Too big for my daughter and material is very thin.
1.0,"I will give this product one star, only because it fit, but the color of the item I received,  was no where like that seen in the picture. Color looked washed out and faded. I should have returned it, but procrastinated, and am therefore stuck with it. Feel badly about giving it to any of my friends, as this is something I would not wear myself."
1.0,This item was mildewed. It stunk so bad I had to put it outside. It only cost $3 so I didn't send it back. I eventually threw it away - it was that bad.
1.0,"Be aware that only ONE comes in the package - what a scam. Last time I looked, I have two feet.  Can't imagine buying shoes, and the store hands you only ONE!  Really? Some other barefoot sandal sellers on Amazon DO give you a PAIR - a set for both feet.  Plus, I tried it on and walked a few steps, then the string broke. Beads were sprinkling all over. Of course, some fell below the deck boards!  Not impressed.<br />Finally, be aware of this also.  I was going to be return it, but since I am required to pay the shipping back it is not feasible. The cost to return it, is about the cost of the item. What a joke."
1.0,"The picture makes this look like it's high quality, but it's so note. It's very cheap looking. I was embarrassed to give it as  a gift to my Harry Potter friend."
1.0,"Terribly misleading photo; great earrings for a ten year old girl, but not for my wife."
1.0,"I ordered this cute little set for my niece, because this is THE ONLY THING she asked for for Christmas. And then I get a message saying the order has been cancelled on the day it was supposed to arrive…SIX DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS!  If they’d listed low or out of stock, I would have ordered from somewhere else, but now I’m going to be scrambling to fulfill a three year old’s heartfelt desire for a rainbow bracelet that she’s certain Santa is bringing her."
1.0,Very cheap looking. Does not look like picture. I returned it.
1.0,This night gown is so rough and scratchy. I washed numerous times with fabric softener but it didn’t help. I threw it out.

1.0,Was too big and no way to make it smaller
1.0,This item broke after two days. I do not recommend purchasing it.

1.0,Terrible choice...period!
1.0,I take a solid size 12 and ordered a large. It was about 10 inches from closing. Runs EXTREMELY small. A large is equal to a size 2 beware!
1.0,"Beware if you have wide feet these shoes will not fit! I was very disappointed that I couldn't even put my foot in the shoe. Ive ordered other shoes from this line and they fit as expected, but not this shoe!"

1.0,One of them was broke
1.0,I’m 5’10 and it ran a little too short for me.
1.0,I like them on line and so does my grandson. But they are two weeks late. He didn't get to start in his tennis he wanted. Had to spend extra money and buy a pair white from Zulliy.

1.0,Cheesy. Cheap
1.0,I ordered a 14-16. They literally looked like a 6x. I haven't even washed them yet. They'll probably fit a toddler. I'll be returning them.
1.0,"I am 5'7"" and a 160 pounds  And this barely fits me! I have to use it on the biggest Notch But it looks kind of silly. Just be aware it is very small!"
1.0,"Only I star because you have to leave something (0 if I could have) but I recieved this necklace....the gold colored leaf pendant is absolutely gorgeous but the chain it came with was broken, cheap, short and SILVER, WHAT THE HECK!!!!! I was so looking forward to wearing it but now have to spend time finding a chain to put it on. NOT HAPPY AT ALL!"

1.0,Fits oddly
1.0,I bought this dress and bought one size bigger and still didn't fit.
1.0,"Caused my son to break out, had no issues with Pull Ups brand. He did LOVE the Paw Patrol theme though and was excited to wear them for that."
1.0,"I purchased these earrings and was OK with them for several months. I found my ears sensitive a couple nights ago and took out these earrings in order to sleep more comfortable.  Note: I take my earrings out every week to clean them.<br />I have discovered that my ears are now feeding out black metal flake. I wish I could post pocs so people could see how bad this is. The holes in my ears keep feeding out metal. Not puss, no ooze, just metal flakes. This is in no way decent gold. If you are sensitive in any manner do not buy these."
1.0,Badly tarnished when it arrived on both sides and the entire ring that holds it to the chain.  Returned it immediately.  Bad deal.
1.0,I purchase this item and usually wear a large but this item is extremely big.......more like a plus size.. its design is not great at all.. flare  on bottom of pants have threads coming apart .. ...plain hideous ..... I tried to return the product but the seller will not return the emails to provide a return address..<br />Guess I am stuck with this poorly designed product ...... what a waste of money.<br />..  bad communication and product is poor.<br /><br />Donating this item to goodwill ..<br /><br />I will never order from this company again
1.0,The stones fell out of the setting I will not be buying from this company again thank you
1.0,My daughter is thin and this shirt way too tight in body and sleeves. Probably manufactured in China.
1.0,Delivered with a hole!
1.0,"Cute top in the photo but I couldn't even try it on because it smells SO TERRIBLE! It comes in a zipper pouch from China and I couldn't open it without gagging. It would cost me a 1/3 of what I paid for it to return it so it went into the garbage.<br /><br />Beware the oil slick stink on this one!  Amazon,  you shouldn't allow this item to be on your site!"
1.0,"Loved the ring but it broke in half in less than a week, very disappointed."
1.0,Picture looks better than the product it's cheap material

1.0,This wallets clasp broke almost immediately. Not a fan.
1.0,"way, way, way too small.  I wear an XL and these were about a medium."
1.0,Received a wrong design but the quality looks good
1.0,"Fabric feels like it’s a thin and rough nylon material. Not see through, but cheap material and uncomfortable to wear. It constantly rubs against my legs as I walk, and the material isn’t very stretchy. Feels rough almost like sandpaper. It was made to fit thin people, and it doesn’t conform to your figure. If your figure isn’t the same shape as the leggings it won’t fit. Will be returning."
1.0,Very cheap. Battery did not work when I received it.
1.0,Look very cheap. Color is not good.
1.0,A different model has come to me from the image. Misleading advertising.
1.0,The earring was cute when I received it but a few weeks later it started turning green already I was not happy
1.0,"I'd really love to give this product 5 stars, but just can't.  The capris themselves are gorgeous, the fabric is soft and light and I think these would be the best capris I've ever owned IF...THEY WOULD SEND ME THE RIGHT SIZE!!!  I've ordered these pants 3 times now in medium and have recieved the wrong size EVERY TIME!!!  So I honestly have no way of knowing if they are true to size or if the material holds up, because I haven't actually been able to wear a pair longer than to just try them on the first time."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:665b868cbe64f5bfc757f7866d1d7ace]] Cheap feeling too light makes clicking noise in motion even after you close the clasp wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy it not even my enemy!
1.0,Extremely small. Will be returning
1.0,"The skirt was too tight, and not able to zip the skirt up. I didn't have time to buy a different skirt so I had to deal with this one and use the tie to mask the fact it didn't fit."
1.0,My daughter lives it and immediately out it in but was so sad when the flower feel if I after wearing it for an hour. I'm going to try to sew it back on for her...
1.0,The shape of the socks looked nothing like the picture in the item listing. It looked more like a sock for a cabbage patch doll.
1.0,"I love the verse and it looks so pretty, but it is no flexible enough.  I wore it one day and it just wasn't comfy.  It just didn't seem to shape to my wrist like a normal bracelet...."
1.0,My son just turned 2 years old this week  and he wears a size 7 in toddler size these sock shoes where way too small for him I’m bumped out that he can’t wear them
1.0,Silver isn't in that game!
1.0,Same as with the B I ordered.  Opening too small to fit on my bracelet
1.0,Definitely not as expected and it was not returnable. The gold tie actually looks tan against the gold lace part.
1.0,"The product had been sitting up and had gotten weathered. Once on my glasses, they cracked and crumbled after a week of usage. Very poor shelf life."
1.0,Little metal tabs are on the inside of the shoe and are very painful.

1.0,"Kept breaking, tried to salvage it to no avail."
1.0,"I bought these to wear as daith earrings for my ears, and the red balls just came to pieces in my ears as I wore them!  I have no idea I any of the red pieces are down inside my ear or nor, but that is what happened.  They just came apart in pieces in my ears. No more red balls!!  Very cheap!!!"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:c4d0b2bd0126d66a2bdcf651217a114a]] was WAY different than what I thought I would get, they aren’t half as cute as the picture. Talk about CATFISH! To top it they were slightly different sizes. Labeled as a zero but there was nothing to stop the plug from falling out and they were slightly smaller than a zero. They just slipped right out of my ears."
1.0,wayyyyy too large
1.0,I thought this looked super cool- but it had a missing snap to actually wear it! Major defect.  Too cheap to even send back
1.0,"Shirts are too small for me, I’m 6”4 220 and got an XL. They fit like a wife beater with poor dry fit material. I would not recommend."

1.0,The material was nice but the dress has a very short piece of material over the breasts and does not cover like it shows in the pictures.

1.0,"Love the look, but it ripped the first time it was used. Save your money"
1.0,Not correct item for description.
1.0,Returned. Had no pink paint. Didn't really look like anything.

1.0,No Me Agrado No es Como Aparece En La Foto y Tela de Mala Calidad
1.0,Cute earrings but I am giving them one star because they came broken. The back piece on both of the earrings aren’t attached. I bought them as a gift so I’m going to try and glue them back on.
1.0,Ridiculously too small
1.0,No noise piece
1.0,The straps broke really quickly. The mask is too long or wide or something... hard to explain!
1.0,the tools sent with the item do not fit the part. it only come with three pins not four.
1.0,Huge. Too heavy to actually stay in the ear. More obviously cheap than I would have liked.
1.0,They are way too big and the cut of the stone looks cheap and ugly..not happy with this purchase
1.0,"The shirt is super soft, beautiful color.<br />When I opened the package part of the shirt was torn."
1.0,"Too big, not as expected decided to keep anyway - washed it and it shrunk to easily."
1.0,Just received today with a dot of the reflective covering missing and looks like its going to peel. Would like to replace but went and tried and said it doesn't allow returns:(
1.0,"This dress was awful.  Bought this for my teen daughter to wear to a Breast Cancer Awareness event the front is completely sewn on a noticeable slant the dress is so thin you can easily read a newspaper through it, for the cost this was not a good purchase!!  Buyer beware!"
1.0,Way to small feels like it's sucking the life out of me can't wear but it's cute
1.0,"Nope don’t do it, made of paper or something, wore it once and it started to rip and crack, design is printed on and looks so cheesy"
1.0,Impossible to close
1.0,Look so ordinary
1.0,"It is not mint green. It’s a weird green color, don’t know what I would call it.  It is cut weirdly & looks horrible on.  It was cheap so not worth the time and effort to return it, but if I could give it zero stars I would"
1.0,So cheap... definitely get what you pay for. Was completely bent just from shipping. Tried to straighten it out and it snapped the metal right in half. Just threw it away.
1.0,"Total garbage. Felt like they were going to fall apart just putting them on. Very cheap construction. Also where the tongue of the shoe connects has a very abrasive area that will rub the top of your foot raw. The way the Velcro straps are made, with no loop for leverage dose not allow you to adjust the tightness of the fit.... I was so disgusted with this product I literally sent it back within an hour of receiving it and I typically never return items."
1.0,I take a 2x and this is a 3X and wayyyy too small
1.0,Very cheap material and didn't even arrive on time
1.0,This would fit a two year old
1.0,Lavender color not light pink
1.0,This is cheaply made and not for daily use.
1.0,Bags too small and had offensive odor. Returning.
1.0,I have a tour of these but I didn’t bother to open them until it was too late to return. The quality of the workmanship is the worst I’ve ever seen. Please don’t make mistake of purchasing even one of them
1.0,"I don't like to write bad reviews but I ordered this clip around September 3rd and now it's October 3rd and I still don't have it. I figured It wasn't worth the $2 I spent to call and sit on hold to figure out where it is . In addition to that, the event I wanted to wear it to was last weekend. I'm just writing it off as a charitable donation and I think I'll avoid order from them again."
1.0,"I purchased this jacket as a wardrobe item, not for any special occasion, it was in my cart for a while and when I finally decided to purchase it I was sorely disappointed.  Polyester has come a long way in the last 30-40 years, BUT NOT THIS GARMENT!  This jacket was stuck in the double knit polyester of the 70s, what a shock that garments like this still existed.  This is for rental to junior high school kids going on their first prom, or an actor doing a 'PERIOD&#34; piece."
1.0,Comes really short and the material was cheap.
1.0,As usual since manufacturers are making sizes bigger. I am a true xs but lately xs have been too big. These were baggy in the waist and legs. I did find another company that makes a xxs. These are terrible
1.0,Charms fell off after only a day of wearing
1.0,"Taking this to Ireland with me so I don't have to carry a big purse with me for my camera, wallet, etc. Quality material. I can carry a small umbrella inside as well.- UPDATED REVIEW- After three days of use two zippers broke. Will not recommend to buy."
1.0,I received a broken pr.
1.0,"I wasn't looking for the best pair of sunglasses, hence me ordering a pair less than $10. But the quality is absolutely horrible. You have to fight to even just to open the sunglasses until it feels like its about to break. I went to return the product, as it turns out you can't even return the product."
1.0,Need to return product so need address to send it to. I have original packing but no information for return. I should like larger size.
1.0,"I read a note from the seller saying not to buy this product if one had a large head.  Well, I know I have a very small head (I usually wear baseball caps in their tightest setting).  I also have very short hair.  Well, these caps did not fit my very small head AT ALL! The description for these should make it clear that they are intended for very young girls."
1.0,"the listing and the scan tag on the item state that it is 20g. HOWEVER the item itself is actually 16g, as stated on the front of the package i received."
1.0,The green is a great colour but you see everything brown when looking through them
1.0,They came crooked
1.0,Sizing is way off!!! I ordered an XL because I wanted it to be loose and it fit more like a medium.
1.0,"Not worth your money! It’s cheap looking, will not stay on, and face did not match the band."
1.0,Received metal bars not bioflex.
1.0,"I bought these as a gift and am returning them. I gave a 1 star review for two reasons. The stone on one earring arrived chipped. Secondly, the back of each stone is coated so you cannot see through it. That may be fine for someone else but it's just not appealing to me. I don't know the reason for this but ultimately, I wasn't happy with this."
1.0,Seam of dress is down the middle. No seam in the back so the skirt was put on incorrect.
1.0,Broke within 5 min of opening the package don’t waste your money
1.0,"My measurements are:  43.5 (44 a couple of days a month--PMS) bust, 36 waist, 41.5 hips.  Also, I have a 38"" upper bust (directly under my arms around my chest, but above my boobs).  The measurement from the center of my shoulder, measuring down my body, and over my chest, ending directly under my breast and touching my rib cage is 16""  I am a  solid 38""DD.  I am 51 y.o.<br /><br />I originally ordered the Dark Yellow in a 3XL, based on the size chart, and everything about it was way too tight and THERE IS NO STRETCH AND THE DESCRIPTION IS WRONG IN DARK YELLOW.  it could be such a great dress if they used a heavy cotton knit with these prints so it had stretch and breathability on hot days.  So I returned (They won't let  you do exchanges for this, so if you don't get it with the ""free shipping,"" you will be paying for shipping....).  I then ordered the 4XL, thinking I would just have to take it in.  I sew so no worries.  HOWEVER....<br /><br />The manufacturer, may increase the circumference of the chest area, but this not enough to allow women with larger breasts to wear the upper sizes.  They do not increase the length of the bodice on this dress as the circumference goes up.  The distance from the shoulder seam to the upper seam of the wide waist band is only 13"" long on the 3XL.  So, that means my measurement, of 16"" from the center of my shoulder, straight down my chest and over my breast is 3"" longer than the material on the dress, therefore, the waist band sits on my boob, and it makes the entire waist band look wider because it's hanging higher up.  It's one problem with all these China designed dresses---either they have no large chested models when designing in China, or they don't increase the bodice length as sizes go up, to save money.  Either way, more than 50% of the time, the waist band sits on my boobs, even when the circumference of the top fits.  Additionally, the armhole (armscye) was way too small, also, it cut into my shoulder joint in a weird way----like it was uncomfortable just standing, not moving my arms.  This would have been an easy fix since it's sleeveless, but in totality, this is the one of the most ill-fitting dresses I have ever purchased on Amazon.  Here are the sizes I can wear in the US:  15 in juniors, 12-14 women's, 16 in petites--Walmart women's clothes: M to 10/12.  There is no way in this in entire world I am a 5XL, and even if they offered it, it would be an intermediate sewing project to make it fit.  If you are flat chested, I suspect it will fit you, so long as you do not carry a lot of fat around your upper chest, because the armscye (armhole) will not fit.  Another thing that was off was the shoulder width.  I have broad shoulders as a woman, and I would have had to take the shoulders in if I was keeping the dress, which would would have meant the armscye was WAYYY too small.<br /><br />I wanted to buy several more colors because I love the prints, but it's a no go. This dress was the yellowish-tan floral color, and it will be see-through on a sunny day, so you will need to wear a slip. Fit is everything, and one reason I am leaning more towards making my own clothes...I am so sick of ill-fitting garments.  This could be a very cute and flattering dress, but............total disappointment.<br /><br />I may try to reconstruct this dress by replacing the waist band with another fabric, and adding the existing waistband material to the bodies at the shoulder to drop the bodice length and add a button or two.  But it's a lot of work for a $20 dress.  I hate all the stretch fabric out today, but if they are going to have sizes this wonky, a stretch fabric could have solved some of the problems (armscye).  I may also just use this dress to make a pattern, and make other dresses to fit.  Again, if you take your measurements, go by the chart, err to sizing up, and if you have a flatter chest, it may fit well.<br /><br />05-2022 Update: I just checked back on this dress when Amazon brought it up on a search.  I was hoping the manufacturer read all the reviews complaining about the fabric and fit issues and maybe adjusted their design (shirring with elastic in the back of the waistband might help), sizing and fabric choice (again, and thin cotton jersey with double fabric in the waistband would be a dream) but no.....too bad, because I do love the prints so much."
1.0,"I ordered XXL and the shirt label said XXL, but the actual shirt size is closer to MEDIUM. The fabric is extremely thin. If the shirt was white, you'd be able to see through it. I was excited about giving my husband this shirt for Christmas. After it arrived, I didn't give it to him. Bah Humbug"
1.0,It was not as tapered as the picture. It is more like a straight.
1.0,You get what you pay for this ring turned my finger green after sweating
1.0,"So i bought two of these tops for me and my niece. i read the reviews that advised to buy a size up...and i did. I usually wear 1X and I bought 2X...it was still TOO SMALL! I wore it and it felt like i was wearing a tight garbage bag. Not only because it was SMALL, but the material was really bad and scratchy. That was really unfortunate because the design was really nice."
1.0,Band detaches from watch with the slightest touch
1.0,The top fit great & I really wish I could keep just the top. The bottoms however are like 4 sizes too small.
1.0,Extremely hard to fasten and won't stay fastened.  Also heavy in weight.
1.0,Looks like thermal underwear.  It’s not nice and flowy like other waffle knit shirt. It’s also very short. There are other shirts on here much nicer.
1.0,This was supposed to come with a cleaning cloth-IT DID NOT. Stain inside case like it’s been used.
1.0,Watch band is ok. Free tool broke without being able to remove the links. Now need to see a jeweler😢
1.0,La talla es para una niña como de diez años pero delgada (no me deja enviar el comentario sin dar una estrella)
1.0,"Like another reviewer, I had the purse only 5 months when the connector for the strap broke. I expect better for the price. Very disappointed since the bag met my needs nicely before it broke."
1.0,Really wanted to like these but the arm broke off in less than of a week of light wear
1.0,Fabric quality is upsetting right away...then you wash it n gets worse. How’s this possible!? Ugh.
1.0,Can't use it.It is broken.Very poor quality. I notice it is made in China.I am not impressed with products made in China.<br />Can I ship this back?
1.0,"Poor quality, hassle on returning"
1.0,"After worn 1 time it started to fall apart. I stitched it up some, but it only last two more wears. I don't think that 1.5 hours of use is enough to call this quality."
1.0,I wanted to love this dress so bad that I ordered it twice. I normally wear an X-Large. I ordered an XL and an Large and it was still too big.
1.0,Extremely small. One long piece of fabric with no guidance or coverage/ support.
1.0,The quality wasn’t great. Fit was okay but I didn’t receive the shorts that were supposed to come in it. Not a great experience overall.
1.0,"Very cheap quality!  Looks, feels and fit like a costume.  I would never buy from you again.  Photo very deceiving! Material is trash!!!!"
1.0,"this broke the same day i got it, it didnt fit, its shaped very awkwardly. just no."
1.0,"This is cut very high on the leg so if you’re curvy, it cuts in the hips and looks awkward. Not flattering. Very cheeky, too. I tried to show that without being vulgar. Trying to keep DD breasts contained in this thing is a joke. Not for long torsos. Returning ASAP!"
1.0,OMG  the black dye on these pants rubbed off on everything!!!!!!!  Very dissatisfied!!!!!!!😟
1.0,I'd like to give this a -5 🌟 review. It doesn't look like the picture. Seriously thought it was gold plastic at first. It was broken when I pulled it out of the package. One of the chains was snapped. It broke the rest of the way while trying to put it on my ankle. Don't buy this. Waste of money.
1.0,"So I ordered two pairs of this brand for my birthday . One pair developed a huge hole in near the rear within an hour . The second pair were either not plus size or capris . Since the product had so many good reviews , I decided to send back and give a second chance . Well that was a mistake . This pair looks like someone wore and put a hole in them sent back and the stiched up . I wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't for the awkward crooked double crotch seams and one is obviously hand sewn ."
1.0,These socks are labeled XXL. They do not fit well and should have been labeled Small.
1.0,Frumpy af<br />Dusty rose not red at all<br />Returned
1.0,The seams in the bust were all wrong unless you grow your boobs out of your neck
1.0,I recived this watch with glass broken
1.0,I had to return it because it was unwearable. The sizing ran extremely small. Material was crepe-like and papery.
1.0,Very disappointed. I ordered the size 1-2 for my 17 month old who is small for her age and the pants are capris on her! Jacket fits fine.  Super cute outfit but sizing needs to be adjusted! Shipping was timely at least.
1.0,The magnet is good the necklace is terrible broke before I could use it
1.0,Very scratchy. The leg decal is almost completely washed off. Not comfortable.
1.0,This brand of leggings is so cheaply made. The lack of quality of fabric ruins the fun of the print.
1.0,I ordered 3T and it was too short. 3T probably fits 18 months. Very thin material.
1.0,Not very good quality.  Average for he price
1.0,This was supposed to be engraved. I didn't order a blank bracelet. Don't advertise engraving if you're not going to fall thru with it.
1.0,"The shirt itself is nice material and soft. Its a bit smaller than i expected. However, the material used for the design is not good quality. Its already peeling and crimping and has only been worn and washed once. Will not buy from this seller again."
1.0,"Doesn't fit anything like the photos - uneven cut, fabric curls up in numerous spots. Just not worth it."
1.0,Doesn’t come with power pack to heat it. Thus it’s not a “heated vest”!
1.0,"The only reason I'm giving this one star is because I love Lapis. The shipping took forever, and only 2 days after I got it, my finger turned green! I tried coating the inside of the ring with clear nail topcoat so I could wear it, but after only a few days, nope! Back to green!  I can't wear it and now after a month  of trying to figure out a way to fix it, I had to give up and not wear it at all. What a stunning waste. I am very rarely disappointed when I shop on Amazon, I read reviews and try to make informed decisions, but this. I will never buy from Yaziland again and I will make sure to tell my friends the same. Otherwise Amazon has always gone above my expectations for a great shopping experience"
1.0,"Not worth it, weird fit, looks fine in the picture but not in real life"
1.0,Purchased to see how big a 100% silk scarf for this price would be. I expected a Barbie Doll sized scarf. This is a pretty scarf. It has a tag that reads 100% silk feeling polyester scarf. It is silky feeling and I gifted it as intended.
1.0,"I really wanted to love these pants. The fabric is beautiful with very soft cotton.  But the bear design is simply a piece of fabric that has not been seamed simply stitched on the rear of the pants.  When I opened package, the edges of the bear design were not only fraying and rolled over but the seam edge was completely uneven all the way around....like someone just took a pair of scissors and cut them freehand.  Without these edges being hemmed, this will fray all the way down to the stitching after each wash (I was a professional seamstress).  This was suppose to be a baby gift but I cannot give this to anyone with such a tacky seam job like this.  Who makes anything without hemming the material???  It will immediately fray and fall apart.  Otherwise, very cute but a poor sewing decision by this manufacturer."
1.0,very cheep. it was broke when I received it.
1.0,Shorter than appeared and color is off. Looks to be maroon but came in more pink
1.0,I could see this working well for someone with a shorter stature.
1.0,Glasses — had several laloops befor<br />This on was too short and cheap looking !<br />Very disappointed<br /><br />I have one I’m very fond of and wanted to replace as it broke
1.0,"Very disappointed. I am rather large, usually wear XL. To be safe I ordered XXL and then worried it would be way to big. Was I ever wrong, it was much too small across the chest and didn't look as good as photo."
1.0,what i have i love but it looks nothing like this photo.. This is completely different from what I ordered.
1.0,"the watch never worked since i got it, i contacted the seller and i didnt like their response so i threw it in the garbage had i had read the previous reviews i would not have purchased it since other buyers had had this problem."
1.0,"It was more like a shirt, not a dress."
1.0,Loved it for 2 weeks until the case cracked.
1.0,I’ve ordered 3 times.. these same pants. First time I ordered a medium(my normal size for leggings) were too small.. second time I ordered a large and there was a run in the crotch area.. I reached out to seller for replacement but instead I had to return and reorder. Third time I ordered I accidentally ordered XL.. I excepted to be a little big but instead were smaller than the mediums...<br /><br />I’m really bummed out because I really really loved the color of green and the style of these leggings. Too much of a hassle to try and order a 4th pair.
1.0,"I was so hopeful for this dress that I bought twi in different colors. But when they arrived, the material was thin and cheap. They were poorly made and ran a bit small. Disappointed and sending both back."
1.0,Too tight. Really hard to get long locs into the cap.
1.0,do not buy this necklace it comes looking nothing like the picture it looks dull and it looks like a completely different pineapple. the leaves on mine are bigger than the pineapple itself and in the picture it looks like the leaves are facing down well they face up. and it doesnt have little studds just lines.
1.0,"The Skull netting in the back, is upside down!! Not worth the money to send it back!!"
1.0,"Terrible quality, no candy on it which was the point of the order. Very Dissappointed!"
1.0,Item arrived snapped in 2!!!! Will not be replacing from this brand.  So disappointing. Can’t believe these sunglasses have so many good reviews.
1.0,Received a children's sweater
1.0,They were so small my 12 year grandson couldnt even fit and i bought them for my husband they run really small
1.0,Really really disappointed all pockets have ripped threw has really thin pocket liner
1.0,My son wore these for just 3 games and the lace hole at the top ripped as he tied his shoe tonight. He is only 9 and shouldn’t be strong enough to rip a shoe.
1.0,"I’m not sure what to say, but there isn’t much I like about these shirts and I would not purchase again or recommend them. You can’t tell from the pictures that are posted, but they are made of extremely thin, shiny material. Also, one of the 3 shirts has ruching along the front side seams, giving it a very feminine appearance. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but a) I don’t believe it was intentional by the manufacturers and b) it is not shown that way in any of the pictures. Overall very disappointed and will most likely be donating/discarding these."
1.0,"Not what I was expecting. This apron is so cheaply made. I purchased this as a gift for a friend, but when it arrived I decided I would be to embarrassed to give it to her. A refund was issued per my request without any issues."
1.0,I cannot size it.  Band is extremely cheap.
1.0,More like little kids jeans.
1.0,Turned ( gold faded) in just a few hours of wear .... Only could fit about 2 the rest was extremely too big had to wear sum on my thumbs yes they r cheap but they look cheap in quality dnt buy
1.0,"This is not the pic of the ring I ordered.... Also disappointed, wrong color stone.. Its Not clear its a black stone..."
1.0,Not that great.. Cheaply made. Not worth what I paid.
1.0,Size was not at all correct!  This would fit a small child!
1.0,"the dye was uneven, had dark and light patches, as well as lots of glossy patches that looked like when you iron over it the wrong way.  Returned."
1.0,I bought this pair for my daughter and a pair for my son hoping they would last at least two months for them to get over the idea of owning this kind of shoes. Hers only lit up until the second time she wore them his only lit up the first 5 times he wore them. terrible product.  I was hopping they would work at least 2 months for the price.
1.0,Don’t buy it garbage
1.0,"The size is deceiving . I thought it would be bigger than what it looks, and the person I bought it for did not like it. For the money, the price needs to fit the size."
1.0,No way this can go on your ear like this! Deceptive photo.
1.0,The backs were totally bent due to poor packing....they tossed them in bubble envelope without protecting them first...<br />There were four items packed together....two were damaged...two were not.
1.0,We placed and air tag In this item for my son and lost it the same day kept falling out.
1.0,Does not look as good with flats or high heels as I would have expected. Also they are uncomfortable.
1.0,Cheap. Took forever to come.
1.0,"Strange fit, not made well. Had to send it back"
1.0,Does not look like image.  Socks are gray and faded looking.
1.0,It is rather blah on your wrist.  Manly looking.
1.0,Not very supportive or cushioned and they fell apart after only one week. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"This was supposed to be an adults item, it was sized for a child."
1.0,"This problem is absolutely HORRIBLE. For starters, Velcro patches are on the wrong sides. Second, the material is itchy. There’s more but you get my point. Look elsewhere!!!!"
1.0,This product sucks I will never use it. Waste of money..
1.0,It was wayyyy too big and didn’t really fit my watch
1.0,"I’m not very pleased with this purchase. They bent while I was trying to put the backing on. Although the cost is low, it’s definitely not worth it"
1.0,"Very disappointed. These are neither bone nor coconut wood. The edges are ridiculously sharp, had to file them down and the two are not the same size.  I cannot believe I paid this much money for such cheap crap. I’m saddened.<br />I DO NOT recommend"
1.0,Broke when I tried to put it on.
1.0,"These boots came out of the bag with a terrible, strong odor that did not go away after days in the garage.  And one of the zippers came off in my hand the first time I tried them on.  Returned them.  No one should have to smell these shoes--worker or purchaser."
1.0,Only made for anorexic chicks
1.0,Loved the shirt till the white faith logo had yellow spots appear. No wonder it's no longer available.
1.0,Sizes are not accurate!
1.0,Was really excited about this dress but received it and the strap wasn’t e em sewn on the dress. At first I thought it was tangled together and then realized it was “broken.” Very disappointed.
1.0,"The fit was fine. Online the color appeared fine but, it was not what I expected when it arrived; it’s an odd color however I was okay with it. The material was also very different; something I wouldn’t buy if I saw it in person. However, I liked the style so I kept it. I wore it one time with a pair of jeans. By the end of the day, I noticed discoloration on the shirt. I treated the stain, washed it & the stain is still there. Trash!!!<br />Just blow money into the wind!!!"
1.0,"These are not like regular Buttery Soft Comfy Stretchy leggings at all!!! And they are way to long! They are so thick and not stretchy at all but yet, they look like you can see your skin through them! Definitely not a Plus size neither! I'm used to the soft, Stretchy jus perfect length and all around leggings that u can stretch on over your legs and stomach easily and they stay put all day long! Not these kind! You have to keep pulling them up and they are so long, it's ridiculous! Shorter, plus size women, beware!"
1.0,I love the look of Opal septum rings. I literally wore this once and a couple of the gems had already fallen out. Do not recommend at all!
1.0,"Nice fabric, runs toooooooo small"
1.0,Not a fan. I don't think this is a unisex belt because it is so stretchy it won't hold up you pants. It is for looks only. My wife is the fashionable one in my house and likes it but it is not a belt for funksonallty.  By the way I would give it a 5 for fashion but that is not why I buy a belt.
1.0,It ruined the screen on my fit bit when I was taking the old one off and the new one on.
1.0,Bells fell off wrist after hours of wearing them
1.0,"This is only a 3 month wear, cute but ridiculously cheaply made. We bought different boots from Walmart and they barley have a scratch on them."
1.0,Profile of the wallet is nice.  Incredibly difficult to get cards out of the wallet.  Money clip edges are uncomfortable unless facing out.  Would definitely not want this in the same pocket as a phone.
1.0,It was supposed to come with a buckle.
1.0,Just didn’t fit right.
1.0,"Apparently they do not ship to my area - very disappointed, as I like the style and the colour as well."
1.0,"Very pretty design but arms are really small and even though dress is large it doesn’t fit my arms ( I never have this problem).  Another issue is I can’t figure out how to use both straps to actually wrap the dress, bc if you wrap it makes one strap go on the inside of the dress and then can’t be used to wrap it."
1.0,"I bought two pair of these for driving in the rain, and they were excellent except the fact that the lenses were scratched!! sent back"
1.0,"Doesn't fit fossil smart watch. Seller is in China, it cost more to return it than its worth"
1.0,Shoes are worn and one of the led lights doesn’t work and they were guaranteed by Wednesday and I didn’t get till Thursday... I need a replacement by tomorrow because these are my sons shoes for my wedding on Sunday...
1.0,They did not have any non skid dots on them and they tore almost immediately. Not worth the money spent on them.
1.0,Terrible fabric and lose strings everywhere. People are friendly though.
1.0,Only 4 out of the 12 strands would actually light up. Huge waste of money! Left the pull tabs in until I was ready to wear them and everything. A few of them broke within the first hour of putting them on as well.
1.0,Very bad quality cloth and design and colors are not matching as shown in picture. I Returned the item immediately after I opened the package.
1.0,it is a piece of junk for that price<br />mine came damage loose apart from main body
1.0,Es demasiado cortos y en la foto se ve largo
1.0,"I was exited about my new belt, but after wearing it first time, i simply couldn't unbuckle it !!!  Was fighting with it for a while and ended up cutting it off. I don't recommend it"
1.0,Honestly the picture is disceptive. The item is cheap and does not have the same look.
1.0,Total junk. Most of these were broke. Not high quality at all. The toe rings were tarnished.  Not as advertised at all.  I will say they did refund our money immediately.
1.0,its thin cotton and its logos r heat pressed.
1.0,"Did not like it.... it melts, do not fix on the skin. I will try something else next time."
1.0,"The crotch-to-waste was too large and it was many inches too long. I had to pay for the return. The automated instructions just said to send it, but the seller later asked for a tracking number after I sent it.  Too late for that, and of course weeks later, no refund!  Do not recommend."
1.0,Not a good quality.  Mine arrived with poor stitching and a button missing.
1.0,Very heavy metal pieces
1.0,Very stiff and and uncomfortable but very pretty. Had to go back.
1.0,Received a used item with tags in a zip lock bag  Sending back
1.0,I could NOT breathe in this mask at all!!! Im in the south and this had me sweating so bad!!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:dcdf018eee410de820ea0882ceac23d8]] The watch feels good and looks good but did not work upon arrival
1.0,Don't waist your money.  Terribly sewed falls apart after first wear
1.0,"What I received was not what was pictured. Ear loops were supposed to be sewed onto the mask, but what I received was a gaiter with hole in the sides for the ears which doesn't line up at all... material was flimsy and cheaply made. I only gave it a one because I couldn't go lower..."
1.0,"Absolutely horrible!!!!! These are not safe!!!! I bought these because I needed them for work. Not even in a whole hour when the plastic/rubber O ring that secures it came off, landing me in the bathroom puking because the thing is stuck in my throat and if it doesn’t come out I’ll be in the ER. DO NOT BUY!!!!! Only giving it a 1star because I can’t leave a review without some sort of star"
1.0,Fell apart the second one I put it on.
1.0,I returned it. Bad quality.
1.0,They where too small
1.0,Hat is like super crooked. Need it for a bachelorette party this weekend or I’d return it. Do not buy.
1.0,The dress was cut uneven and was much longer (2+ inches) on the left side than the right. Cheaply made.
1.0,did not fit well at any adjustment
1.0,i’m confused this is literally the smashing pumpkins band logo how is this for cosplay
1.0,"Looked nothing like the photo. The fabric was made to have a gathered, textured look- not ironed/pressed so it clung. Cut too low on chest and cut too high. Buttons stopped 6 inches above the knee. For such a long hem it didn’t work. More important it didn’t follow the pattern of the one shown. Hem dragged even with heels. Total disaster."
1.0,"I don't get this product. it takes to people to put it on, because of the lace in the back and it runs very very very small. I bought this for my back, because I had a different corset and it really helped my back pain, unlike those medical back support products you get in a medical supply place. But I would not recommend this product. Especially for size, run's super small."
1.0,This was only my second time wearing these shoes and the buckle fell off!<br />I’m pretty bummed because the shoes are cute and comfy but seriously useless without the buckle.
1.0,Reading the size chart it says for a 32 waist order the xl....the xl is more for a 38 in waist. Super bummed as I ordered these too late to return and get smaller size.
1.0,This item is not what I expected
1.0,"While the earrings are beautiful, they're electroplated. I've worn nothing but sterling for over 40 years. These aren't sterling.  There is no stamp on either earring, and there are 2 obvious areas where the silver plating did not take. It's black, but it's not tarnish. The hooks may be silver because there's a tiny stamp, but it's so small I can't tell. Even so, I paid for sterling silver earrings,  not hooks. Returning immediately."
1.0,Broke when I got it
1.0,Precio alto<br />Baja calidad<br />Materiales baratos
1.0,"The sizing of these ""5-9"" womens socks is a joke.  They are literally HALF the length of my older Hanes socks in the foot area!  Of course, I washed them before wearing them, so now I don't have the option of returning them.  THESE SOCKS ARE CHILD-SIZE!!!"
1.0,"WASTE OF MONEY I WISH IT CAME WITH INSTRUCTIONS I BROKE THE CHAIN, AND ITS TOO BIG I HAVE A COKE COLA SHAPE !"
1.0,"I ordered blue dress that is around knee length, but I received the long dress that is below the ankle. I would have kept it but it is a really weird fit. The slit on the hip is so loose, its almost as if it would fit someone better with super huge hips for it to look nice."
1.0,Cheap material land totally see through
1.0,Very stiff material it was big on body length but too small on front leg area wouldn't recommend
1.0,Poor craftsmanship.had hole  chest area runs in material. Would not buy again.
1.0,Button fell off after 2 washes. Buttons are in general sewn on very poorly.
1.0,"I bought several of these in different colors.  It loses its grip/bite after a few months.  I don't drop my weights and I don't abuse these collars.  If the creator of these is reading this review, please contact me.  I want to find a way to resolve this issue and I will modify my review if we can find a resolution.  Thank you."
1.0,Definitely not worth the price. Followed the sizing chart but the jeans were too small; still waiting on a refund after mailing back the jeans a month ago. Will not use this seller again
1.0,"It broke, right when I go it! Not too happy about it"
1.0,It barely fit my phone . the buttons were almost impossible to push to activate.
1.0,"Bright colored socks, thin material, slippery when walking on wooden floors.  Moreover, not all socks fit the same.  One sock fits and the other one is too small from the same pair.  I wouldn't purchase this product again."
1.0,Very poor fabric material! You CAN'T even iron it smooth bec of the fabric is poorly made. It is very uncomfortable to wear it feels like plastic. When you sweat it's feels like you are wearing a waterproof material! Waste of money!!
1.0,"These are tiny - gift to my wife so awkward to return - she literally had to ask if they were a shape or not? (neither of us could say they had a ""heart shape""....). The stones on these are honestly about 1 millimeter - very disappointed!"
1.0,Picture looked promising but material of the dress is see through. So unfortunately I have to return it
1.0,It fit awkward on top it was just badly put together
1.0,"Not the material I expected, fits like a sack. Gave it to Goodwill"
1.0,I have several of those and they snag so easily. I have a newborn ( those litte nails grow very quickly and aRe sharp) and I wear a lot of jewelry which gets caught all the time  due to the thin waffle Fabric. I don’t recommend this .Similar shirts from target are much better quality and aren’t as see through even with a nude bra
1.0,I am a size 12 and ordered the XL. This would fit a doll. It is the tiniest dress I've ever ordered. I gave it to my friends 10 year old daughter for dress up.
1.0,"Not only does this band leave you with a skin rash no matter how loose you wear it, but it is pure junk. It doesn’t latch properly. I have had my watch for 2 years and never had a problem with any other band, but I was wearing this band on Friday night and it became unattached and slipped off my wrist. My watch shattered thanks to this piece of junk. Save yourself a broken watch and pass right on by this nonsense!"
1.0,I ordered based on the measurements the company provided and it was too small. Cheap fabrics were used. Would have been great if fabrics were better quality and if size chart was correct.
1.0,"I washed this on cold, hand-wash cycle with Woolite and it shrunk in length at least 5 inches !!!! It is useless now..."
1.0,Watch face completely fell off after 2 weeks. Returning.
1.0,Turned green after wearing one time.
1.0,"too long, 10 in inseam"
1.0,UGLY NOTHING LIKE PIC
1.0,Very hard sole.  Too big.  Seller said free returns and then charges for the return.
1.0,My glasses always fog up with my face mask on. Thought I’d give this a try. Did not work.
1.0,"Cheap material, then again thats what you get with a low price like that. It looks like a medium sized duffle, but it's actually a large duffle. That may or may not be good depending on the size you want, but don't expect it to last long."
1.0,The slit in the front opens widely and you can see the cheap slip underneath. Overall looks really cheap (obviously since it is lol)
1.0,Not cotton. Not breathable. Ugh.
1.0,arrived broken- replaced and broke. Flimsy and cheap in quality.
1.0,"Cheap material , falls off your ads too easy"
1.0,El vestido no es como el de la foto la tela es de muy mala calidad el precio es demaciado alto para la calidad de la tela es muy desepcionante. No recomiendo su pagina
1.0,Broke within minutes of putting on. The watch adapter broke not where it slides into the Apple Watch. The pin came undone as if it’s too short for the adapter that fits the Apple Watch. Fail.
1.0,Terrible earrings. The cuff hurts way too much and pinched my ear lobe like crazy. I could barely wear them because the pain is too much and when I took them off my ears were super red.
1.0,Really thin cotton material. Don’t buy if you want it for the warmth!
1.0,Its not the same in the picture. Frustrated.
1.0,"Adorable jewelry, but it's been less than a day that I've had it and the sunflower on the ring has already broken off. The rest of the jewelry is fine, but the quality of the ring is like one of those cheap play rings that you'd find in a cupcake. Probably not a good sign for how the rest of the jewelry will hold up. In the process of super gluing the ring, now. You get for what you pay for."
1.0,Product is a 5 Star but company that sells should be a zero.
1.0,They initially indicated set of three. Only one arrived. The earring is incredibly small (the picture they posted makes it look decievingly larger). Complete ripoff. Would never buy from them again.
1.0,The product just did not fit properly.  The shirt would hang and it was the correct size.
1.0,Cute dress but was too small.  I tried to return it.  The return required a response from the seller which was a label for a shipping box and and bar code to include in the package.  I went to the post office to mail it and the postage was more than the dress itself!!  Also I was charged 5.99 for shipping on my original order and this was not refunded to me in the Amazon credit.  DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS.
1.0,"Far too large and looked so cheap, and the fringe at the bottom was very misshapen. No amount of ""fluffing"" could fix it to look normal and hang nicely. Sent back right away."
1.0,Had less than 2 weeks and done came apart ..
1.0,The ring is adjustable and is very cheap in the regard.  Always have to adjust the size and now it feels like it is going to break.  Only wore it 2x.
1.0,Way to big for the face.  Looks like a knock off that failed miserably.
1.0,Bought for son who wears an adult mask size but fabric was terribly inco.fortable. return ed same day it arrived.
1.0,Extremely small sizing on this item.
1.0,These sandals should fit the same as the other three pairs of madden girl that I own. I have a black pair same style and these run at least a size smaller then those. I was so bummed when I received them. They also are not as soft as my others. I ended up returning them..
1.0,"Bought these because of the interchangeability of the lenses. After about 2 weeks the rainbow lens cracked for no reason and now the nose close won't lock so none of the lenses stay in. Nice look, cheap make."
1.0,How are sneakers sent in a clear ziplock bag? There is no way I can give these as a gift.
1.0,Ripped from front
1.0,Didn’t like the quality every cheap made
1.0,Love the way it looks. But necklace has an odor and unable to wear it.
1.0,Unwearable. Gate was pinched shut on one of the earrings.
1.0,Low quality. Fun for family photos- already showing wear after two washes.
1.0,"The slit is not on the side, it is split right in the front, and it goes ALL the way up. Like it opens up straight to my belly button. This may work for others, but unless I want to walk around flashing my hoo ha to everyone this will not work for me. Returned quickly."
1.0,Dress looks homemade.  Not happy but will keep to wear at home.  Definately doesn't look like picture.  Very disappointed 😞
1.0,Shirt did not fit like it was supposed to. Had tacky white clasps for black buttons. Very dissaponted
1.0,Awful not true size at all.
1.0,The material was very weird! Had to return...
1.0,These appear to be best used as an accessory not as a functionally working product to hold up your pants. They are nice looking so they're great as part of a costume but not as actual suspenders.
1.0,"The item looks nothing like the picture, I over paid for a item that am not happy with. The iron on looks bad on the t shirt"
1.0,"Poor quality, oversized.<br />Amazon will not allow additional comments"
1.0,"Waste of money.  I can barely get the 2xl size on, yet my other jacket and my shirts are all 2xl and they are loose on me.  This sweatshirt is so tight i have to keep pulling it down.  There is no tag on the sweatshirt, so i dont really know if it IS 2xl.  Also the stitching on the sleaves is bizarre and makes my arms itchy.  Didnt think when people said they are sized small, they meant the completley wrong size.  Also the pouch is partly torn, but is still able to be used as a pouch.  Bad overall product."
1.0,Had to return. Ordered size it said I should for myy 8yo and they came in sized for I assume toddler. Got girl ones same size and fit my daughter just fine
1.0,broke when tying the shoe for the first time so i never wore them and donated them
1.0,It won’t fasten around my wrist. It doesn’t close. I wanted to wear it last night for New Year’s Eve and had to leave it behind
1.0,"DO NOT order from this company. I bought a shirt for XXL and it doesn’t fit at all. It says XXL, though it would fit someone that is a size small or medium. I really want my money back. To think this had to happen to a supernatural shirt. 😡."
1.0,Not real silver tuned on my wrist refund please I bought 2 Sets so embarrassing 1 was for my sister
1.0,My product was worn twice and the wires popped through the middle the third time. Don’t buy this!
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture and it's super thin
1.0,It would be alright if you only had one key or an ID card.  Will not buy this item again
1.0,Do not buy. It is very stiff.
1.0,These came with the seam ripped but my daughter loved them so much she asked me if I could just sew it.  I'm sure the rest will fall apart but they do look cute on her.
1.0,"Honestly hilarious. I’m 5’2” and the sleeves were easily 6 inches too long. My girlfriend who is 5’5” even tried this on and the arms were long on her. Not much to work with since the end of the sleeves don’t have a closure to them. The fit of the other part of this cardigan also ran small. Overall, odd fit."
1.0,"When I opened the item I got a bad surprise. Part of the fabric of the tie was frayed. However, due to the low price of the item I did not put any effort on returning it. But not happy with this delivery"
1.0,"Its not useful at all hairs will fall to ground and umbrella will not keep borders up to stop hairs from falling, wld not recommend to buy,"
1.0,They broke after 2 wearing a
1.0,This bra is very uncomfortable. It pokes into my skin where the underwire is. Not soft either. Did not push up like expected either.
1.0,Zipper continues to open while zipped.
1.0,Leg material stretched out and stayed stretched.one tore between the seam for the rear and crotch. Will not buy ever.
1.0,They provide no compression whatsoever. They're just leg warmers to be at this point. I'm a nurse and definitely do not recommend these
1.0,The quality is very cheap and it wrinkles even after you iron it ...
1.0,Sewn funny runs small made of felt. Only good for cheap Halloween costume
1.0,The product was quite small too be a 2x.
1.0,I thought it would be larger it looks cheap9
1.0,not a real whistle! doesnt whistle!
1.0,"If you are bustier, this suit is not flattering."
1.0,"These are supposed to be leggings but they are huge.  They look very weird on.  Maybe I'm just not thick enough for these and I wish I'd gone with the small.  That being said, the medium is baggy and probably would still look goofy in a size small. I'm 5'10&#34; size 4, 135-140 lbs."
1.0,"this came broken on the top and had orange paint ALL OVER IT!!! My sons party is in 3 days so i cant return it and wait on another one, after reading the reviews i see it wouldnt do any good anyway considering most of the reviews state theirs came in the same terrible shape as mine did!!!!!! WTF amazon? this thing is super overpriced and is complete junk, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!! This thing at most is worth a grand total of $5 max!!!!! so disappointed and i just hope the glue i had to use to get the top to stay together holds long enough to get his party over!!!"
1.0,"Too shear , uoi can see right through it"
1.0,Cheap looking and very poor quality
1.0,I ordered a small and still there wasn't any compression. I would have returned them but I must have thrown them out with the trash.
1.0,"Dress was pretty, however, way to small. I ordered a medium which is what all other dresses are but this one was tight and short. I am retuning it."
1.0,Ordered an xxl and was a medium size. Isn't even designed like in the picture as neck is higher. Couldn't even alter it to make it fit. Will be returned
1.0,An everyday watch.
1.0,Awful. Don’t buy. They’re so ugly on and are huge on the butt area and they flare out .
1.0,"Neither one of these worked. Was going to return, but misplaced them. 🤣. Bottom line. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,Absolutely terrible draw string on the outside one pant leg shorter than the other
1.0,"cheap product! i ordered this and received it without the screws and pieces to assemble.. i got another one and assembled it pretty easily, but was disappointed with the quality...it keeps on coming apart and it's not sturdy at all, the kids were toppling and hurting themselves!... i would not recommend this item!"
1.0,Ordered this product and it took me a while to open it<br /> It never occurred to me that I should have checked the quality as soon as it arrived. One of them has a hole in it! I wish I could return it but too late now. Rest of them were fine.
1.0,"could see right through the shorts, super poor quality, plus it took FOREVER to get"
1.0,"I hadn't even had an opportunity to wear it yet, I washed it once, per the instructions.  I pulled it out of the dryer and about 1/4 of the letters had completely come off and the rest were in the process of coming off"
1.0,These don’t fit closely around eyes causing sand and dust to enter. Even with the padding that is attached to them they do not sit against skin thus allowing debris into eyes.
1.0,Huge. It cotton very thick fabric
1.0,No tiene tan buena calidas en las monturas
1.0,DO NOT BUY! WORST PURCHASE EVER
1.0,The socks go way higher up than shown in the picture. I’m a women’s 8.5 - this is ridiculous.
1.0,The earing cane broken
1.0,Is in the garbage the first day I saw it.
1.0,This would have been nice if it was as described. I received two of the same key chain. Which defeated the whole purpose of this purchase. Not worth the hassle to send it back since it was meant as a Father’s Day gift. Disappointed ☹️
1.0,"These are junk! So not worth the price. The clasps on some open and others do not. Very hard to put in since they are not perfectly aligned. I had 1 break already and lost a couple because they come undone. For the price of these I expected them to be made better. Would have love to have been able to return but since i lost some that is out of the question. I do not  anticipate these lasting long. The smallest one is the hardest to put in, you almost have to have someone help you otherwise it could take up to 30 minutes trying. Some were bent and I had to try to straighten them out. No one of the hoops was not flawed.  Keep looking for another set other than this one."
1.0,"the material itself was great, I did not get a chance to try on this item sadly. The stitching at coming off and it had a hole on the side of the dress. I was pretty sad."
1.0,Already falling apart when I got it. It went right in the trash! Plus it looked cheap. Nothing like the picture.
1.0,I was so excited about this shirt but unfortunately it just arrived and has a stain on the front. Definitely does run small fyi
1.0,Sizing is completely off.  I typically wear a medium and this fit my 8 year old.  Not nearly as long as the photo either.
1.0,"Wish I wouldn't have wasted money on this dress.  The buttons on the bottom 2-3 constantly unbutton so I can't wear it.  It shrunk in the wash, so size up one size if my review hasn't deterred you.  I put my hand in the pocket (yay pockets!), and it tore slightly at the seam.  Cheaply made.  I have learned my lesson.  No clothing shopping on Amazon."
1.0,"These are so very small, not the 2mm they state. In fact I am afraid to wear them as I think they will slip through the hole in my nose. I have 3mm ones and these are 4x smaller than those. No way they are 2mm."
1.0,I keep buying these for my husband but they are not much good.  The metal clip in the front is cheap trash and he can only wear them once or twice before they pop off.  If I could find these anywhere else I would buy them there.
1.0,Size incorrect
1.0,I have bought sunglasses at the dollar store that were better than these.  I don't recommend them at all.
1.0,"Fine dress, fit just right. The material is CHEAP!! If you want to dress properly for a business-professional setting do not get this dress. If is all polyester and spandex, and looks as so. The belt is plastic & wrinkles. Target is a better investment."
1.0,Not a real stone. Please dont buy unless your looking for costume jewelry.
1.0,Returned one right away because it broke got a replacement and 40 days later the replacement broke. Then a few days later the other one broke. They are garbage.
1.0,"Zaful needs to get with the program. Large is HUGE and the medium gas bottoms that fit but a top that is tiny. You can’t order separate sizing. Stupid, sending this suit back and keeping one only for the bottoms, basically throwing the top away. The material seems ok for the price."
1.0,"The fur sheds constantly with these slippers. Wore them once, then put them in the giveaway bag."
1.0,"As soon as I received these, the blue pair broke. The &#34;bling bling rhinestone&#34; is held on by cheap glue. I then put on the black pair and wore them all day. When I took them off at night, that one broke too. Garbage!"
1.0,Did not last a full year.  Fell apart yesterday.
1.0,Do not buy!  Product is very small and not able to be returned.
1.0,This is so small i am so disappointed in product i just called it a wash i bought a medium that could not fit none at all sizes is a big problem with this
1.0,Chain broke within 8 hours of use. Otherwise it was lovely.
1.0,"I bought two pairs, one black and the other gray. Wore the gray first. They fit fine. Only wore them for 4 hours and when I took them off the seams in the thighs had come apart. I had the black ones on for an hour or so when I looked at my leg and there was a hole in the legging. Not on the seam. I am average size and weight. Holes had nothing to do with fit, but with quality. They are in the trash."
1.0,Runs about two sizes too small. My daughter also said it was &#34;itchy&#34; and didn't like the feel of it. Returning.
1.0,"Horrible cheap product, broke before I could even try on :( get what you pay for I guess gave 1 star for shipping was quick"
1.0,"Poor quality, cheap!"
1.0,It turned my whole figure green
1.0,"I liked the jewelry. I didn’t like the fact that some of the duplicates were missing, and some of the pieces you can’t get the pieces off, they’re too tight or stripped from being fastened wrong. Very disappointed in this purchase, because I really like the pieces that I did get, just wish I was able to use them. I wouldn’t purchase if they can’t get it right."
1.0,"Very disappointing, wanted to love this. Nice Yarn, Extremely Poor Workmanship !!!! Seams looked like a blind person sewed them, not straight, not matching, On the inside material was cut thicker on one side than the other,and even a dirty spot."
1.0,"I was very excited to receive this product but I was very disappointed to find that they fit extremely small. I understand they are compression pants and are supposed to fit snug. I followed the size chart provided by amazon and even ordered a size larger than recommended to make sure they would fit comfortably. I am a size 32&#34; waist and I ordered a large. The size chart recommended a medium for a size 33&#34; so I thought I would be safe going bigger. I struggled to get them over my waist. The legs were also very short. I am 6' and the pants only went down to my calf. I double checked the tag and they are marked a large, but there is no way a 37&#34; waist would fit in them. Overall the quality does seem to be be very good, I am just disappointed that I will not be able to wear them.  Disclosure: I have received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The product was received for inspection and evaluation purposes. After careful testing and thorough examination of this product, I am providing this review. No monitory compensation was received and I was not required to write a positive/negative review."
1.0,"As far as answering the question “how does it fit” I’m going with large… Although it’s so poorly made it’s almost impossible to tell. The seams are crooked. It sits funny based on this. The length  there’s nowhere near what its supposed to be.<br />Considering that it took nearly a month to arrive, is nowhere near worth the time or the money invested. I will be returning this garment."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!!!  This is not what is pictured. Waste of money. The only I’m happy about, is that I only spent $6.00 on it. But do not buy it! This is why I can’t busy clothes or shoes from amazon!"
1.0,I expected much more from the product. The packaging made it seem like it was going to be this immaculate soft leather and upon opening the band it proved to be very cheap looking and it would at best fit a child’s wrist. If you have even a mid sized wrist the band will not fit. I couldn’t even get it on my wrist at the very last hole. Absolutely returning this. Not at all worth the money.
1.0,The sweatshirt is more of a light pink and not that color in the picture
1.0,Band is too big; there appears to be glue splotches on outside and what one attaches to watch face are too big. Would like refund.
1.0,"Too small, it is not for an adult to wear."
1.0,"Way too small. Was supposed to fit an adult, but it was too small…the size of a child."
1.0,"The fit of the jacket was as expected. Ours however did not work as described.  The indicator light did not power on at all. It did heat up a little bit, but mot what I would call a heated vest. Returned with no issue."
1.0,BROKE AFTER THE 1ST DAY OF WEARING THEM. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS BUYER AGAIN. CHEAP STUFF
1.0,The worst deceiving photo ever!!  If there are negative stars I would rate it that!  The color is a disgusting bright purple not the dark eggplant purple as pictured. I would be a laughing stock wearing that!!!  Very very very disappointed!!!! I want my money back!
1.0,I returned them because they were mismatched. One was bigger than the other; the name brand on the covers were also different. I can't share a picture because they have already been returned.
1.0,Broke within a day...
1.0,They were coming apart when I received them. The ones that didn't came apart shortly after wearing them.
1.0,Ball doesn't tighten down
1.0,This would be okay...for a Halloween costume. The shorts look like something you would find in a cheap superhero costume. Same thin material. Returning for a refund.
1.0,"These tights said that they are one size fits all.  It was too small or should I say too short as I am 5'6&#34; tall and it only came up to just above my knees!  My daughter is 4'10&#34; and they only came up to just above her knees too.  I think they sent me the child tights and not the adult tights. This was supposed to be part of my costume.  I had to take a pair of scissors, cut them in half, and then I had to wear yoga shorts to hold the two halves up. All day,  I was afraid that they would roll down.  I gave one star because the red and white striped colors were exactly what I wanted. Besides the color, I was not happy with these tights."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Color not at all as pictured.
1.0,Too small...material feels cheap
1.0,Not a cotton blend as stated in the details strange cheap shiny fabric that doesn't drape properly and the ties somehow make it look even cheaper this is a cancer causer for sure cute idea but poor execution
1.0,Zero stars if I could. Ugliest dress. Nothing like the model. I missed the cut off for returning by 1 day so I’m stuck with it! I don’t even recommend this company!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. A. Potato sack would look better!!!!
1.0,Did not come with clips or headband. Going to have to go to hobby lobby and buy glue gun and buy clips
1.0,This shirt looks loose fitting relax cotton shirt. It came and it's tight spandex nothing like the picture. HORRIBLE!!
1.0,"Not happy with product, never recommend anyone"
1.0,Worst bathing suit I've ever ordered... I got a large and the back didn't even cover my butt crack. Would not recommend.
1.0,Not real septum jewelry for cnn prop use
1.0,Doesnt fit well and the feathers were so tiny. Nots attractive
1.0,I had to return this coat!  The quality was poor.  The size was not at all true to size.  I was very dissatisfied and disappointed.
1.0,Horrible the rips are so little...Horrible
1.0,"These shoes looked thinner than what they were when I receive them. The top part was very wide and not elegant. Looking at all. I would think it would be OK for a casual look, but not for any dresses."
1.0,"Way too big in the waist for what is considered a small, not the same quality at all as other capri pants they sell for less."
1.0,These are one of the worst pairs of leggings I’ve ever worn. They are super long which is nice but they are NOT flattering nor do they do anything for your tummy.
1.0,The slit goes all the way up to your crack. The slip underneath only goes slightly past your waist. So cheap and poorly made.
1.0,Size 32 waist and the pocket seem already ripped. 1 week old. Thin and cheap lining.
1.0,Began pilling within the first 30 mins of wearing.
1.0,This toe ring is very flimsy and it will not stay on my toe.  Definitely wasn't worth what I paid for it.<br />Also had pieces of metal sticking out of the design on the ring.
1.0,Quality is HORRIBLE!
1.0,Returned item...arrived damaged and the material felt and looked cheap
1.0,"Just like the other reviewer, I also did not get all of the items pictured. I got the sticks and the normal connectors. None of the special connectors. Disappointed kid, here I come!  :("
1.0,Broken after trying it on glasses for first time😒
1.0,This belts buckles are too fat for average belt loops.  Nothing on this belt stretches except for one hold down loop that is actually elastic.
1.0,The bracelets fell APART in the 1st week i had them. I Had to throw them out. It was acTotal waste of money.
1.0,I order this for my wife as a new year gift but when I receive and open the packet it's look very cheap 10$. In this they have different Jewelery and which I receive it's totally different. please don't waste your money for this sh....t
1.0,Some of them are deformed. You can't stamp on these. Theyre too small.  Zero stars.
1.0,I could not fasten it to save my life.  Returning it today.
1.0,I do not recommend this if you want a shoes to wear more than one time.
1.0,"Cheap quality! Its see thur, that's how cheap it is. It's too big in the bust for my lil b cups. I'd like to return it. But Corona hit and couldn't."
1.0,Absolutely no support what so ever. It also has a small round padding for each breast that appears strange looking. Definiitly I do not recommend for any type of sports activity.
1.0,"I loved this cute little bee pin, but the back was always coming loose and I eventually lost it due to that. :("
1.0,Horrible fit and feel. What else can I say. Lousy cheap materials. Most of my feet felt like that they were walking on the side bindings
1.0,"Got these shoes 2 days ago.  Very cute, but the right shoe lights already ran out.  I don't see, nor were there directions, on any way to recharge or change the batteries.  Also the right shoes bow has completely come unravelled, causing me to have to remove them.  I would not purchase these again."
1.0,"Bought Plus Size as I'm a 14. Supposed to fit up to 24. That's not going to happen. It doesn't even fit 14. It might fit a 10 ok. If you own Plus Size in this brand in their leggings those are great and fit. These are a joke. The waist band is so small it hurts it just digs and digs. Sending the two pair I got and expected to fit in the waist like their leggings back, and going on the hunt for ones that fit...again."
1.0,I hope you like ironing! These are made of some strange iron resistant material. I highly doubt they are actual cotton. I have to spend AT LEAST 20 minutes ironing one shirt. The colors are nice and they fit well but ironing for that long isn't worth it. My other shirts take maybe 5 minutes if they are very wrinkled.<br /><br />Keep shopping. Pay a few more bucks for a higher quality shirt.
1.0,On a picture looks better. It doesn't looks like leather at all.
1.0,"it's cute but kind of expensive for what's in there. It's already broken, it fell about two feet and the glass shattered sending the tiny pieces inside everywhere.  Junk for what I paid for this"
1.0,Quiero saber si pueden hacerme la devolución del dinero ya que no es un zapato de buena calidad como decía en la reseñas gracias anticipadas
1.0,Was too narrow
1.0,They are cheaply made.  Disappointed!  Sent back.
1.0,NOT tall girl approved!  I'm 5'11 and this was way too short.  The strap broke the 1st time I put it on.  Returned immediately.
1.0,"I'm sorry but my wife said to me about the dress is ugly dress, is not what she expect,<br />Looks more cheaper what was.<br />Note: my wife is regular size.<br />Also the dress looks more dark ."
1.0,Got my package today but without no glasses. I wish I had them to comment about the quality but unfortunately I don't. Until I dont get them I have to recommend that you don't buy them.
1.0,"Poor quality yarn, bad seams, bad fit. Very thin quality in yarn. Looking for warmth and got air conditioning instead"
1.0,"This item came in the mail today, when I opened it it looked like a puzzle,  all the pieces where in the bag and not actually in the necklace how it's suppose to. Color was nice, packaging was just horrible. ..<br />I bought the yellow one.. shame it wasn't well put together,  save your money for something nicer.<br />Just my opinion."
1.0,"I don't believe these are real stones/ crystals. Every bead is the exact size, . It's a cute necklace but I feel that it is totally man made materials.  Would not buy again, I was looking for the real black turmaline and this is not it. I would return it but I gave it as a gift and they like it."
1.0,Not happy with the length. Will be returning
1.0,Poor quality broke the second week
1.0,"The wig looks nothing like the picture. I purchased this wig, tried it on, and there were bald spots in it. It was the worst product I've ever ordered from Amazon."
1.0,"Less reliable than a $20 Timex. After 3 months it does not hold charge.  Cannot get warranty service because I did not mail in my give-us-your-personal-data warranty postcard.<br /><br />Paid a local watch repair guy to replace the capacitor.  Worked for an afternoon, then quit again. Local repair guy said I might as well throw it out. I did."
1.0,Received 2 days late with an entire broken lens. Return and replacement would have been more work than what it’s worth.
1.0,The slippers came in two different sizes. Would not recommend.
1.0,"Item arrived with missing snap, extremely disappointing."
1.0,It’s looks cheap
1.0,Dye leaked and stained my other clothes and skin
1.0,Pants are huge and shirt is way to small
1.0,Pockets should not have been put into this garment; they look horrible.
1.0,"Se sale , no que ajustado. No sirve"
1.0,Very bad material .Fluff appears after third usage which make it extremely un wearable
1.0,"The shoe is missing the inside lining, shoe looks unfinished. Not sure if it's just my pair or if others have received them like this."
1.0,DONT BUY! Absolutely impossible to get the ball back on after you take it apart. Couldn't send back in time so wasted money on this!
1.0,"It's pretty and all, but after about 2 weeks, both necklaces had broken beyond repair 😤"
1.0,Unless you're a child they're barely going to fit your fingers. They're incredibly cheap and not worth the price.
1.0,I liked nothing about this product.  They don't work.  They are not conducting electricity or negative ions.  Grounding does work and I have experienced the benefits first hand.  This product however does not work.  Simple test with a multimeter will show it.  Shame on this company because I don't believe they are ignorant.  Hopefully I can get my money  back.  Don't buy this product.
1.0,Terrible equality. The surface will be destroyed if you wash it.
1.0,Horribly made. You can see the material between the faux fur. The size runs small as well.
1.0,Came with a rip in the front!
1.0,These gloves are so thin and cheaply made. They tear easily. About 1 out of 3 would tear when putting them on. They were all crammed in the box and stuck together. It was a chore trying to separate them.
1.0,Not like it's shown. Stones fell
1.0,Was too big for my 7 y.o. I made the sash work even though it was too big; but the tiara way too big couldn’t wear so I retuned it.
1.0,"Size not correct., made for a petite woman."
1.0,Very poor super thin quality. Don’t even order this.
1.0,Way too small. Even after adjusting to the widest link
1.0,It was way too big and the magnets hurt
1.0,I received a 2 oz. bottle and not a 4 oz. bottle of after care lotion as advertised in the name and photo of this product listing however I just noticed the description says 2 oz. bottle. VERY DECEPTIVE and misleading so buyer beware.
1.0,Package came unsealed and completely empty!  Need this for a costume in 4 days!
1.0,"This product was horrible. Do not waste your money buying this bra. I wore it once and the adhesive was already peeling off my skin. I made sure that my skin was dry so that it would not slip off. I am very displeased by the quality of the product as well as the look of it. This is not my first time buying an adhesive bra but this one is by far the worst. And I normal do not give feedback but I am very upset that after one use, the item did not last the whole day. I will have to throw the bra in the trash.<br /><br />The image is of just one time use"
1.0,Too large for my wrist
1.0,It's pretty but it's too little and tight on my wrist... Made for someone with little wrist.
1.0,"Only size available, but reviews said it ran small.  Now it's too late to return."
1.0,the product is for light i thought they were for heavy duty
1.0,dont even waste your time. these are a joke. not like the picture and looked like a 8xl pair of sweat pants
1.0,So disappointed to small
1.0,"The back of this shirt is horrible, it has a large white lace patch going down the middle of it, yuck"
1.0,"I don like it, because POLAROID is clear, and it cannot be used on all ocasions and if you have eyes problems and every one can see ."
1.0,"I was surprised at how poorly made this hat is.  The stitching is good, the pattern/cut however is not.  The brim is not loose enough to sit level, bends down in the front, but not in a flattering way.  The hat is a little bit larger fit than expected as well.  I'm surprised that this happened with a Pistil product.  Glad the return is easy."
1.0,Design not centered. Not quality I expected.
1.0,Ordered a size 10 and what came is labeled as a 2XL! It’s too short and super boxy.
1.0,"It isn't fully stainless steel. After several weeks, the silver coating on the clasp wore off and it looked like copper. Then half of the chain lost its silver color and looked like a combination of copper and stainless steel. It was not advertised that way. It isn't worth having unless you want a copper-stainless combo chain."
1.0,"This was sent to me used, with someones hair on it. I washed it, disinfected it of course it didn't work. I received a 5$ credit, and the item went into the trash."
1.0,It the same color as pictured
1.0,Que da perfecto
1.0,"Very disappointing experience, the thickness of ring does not tally with the image being shown. Ie comes like a roll of rose gold metal."
1.0,I should have known the sizes on these imported products are dramatically different than USA sizes!  I ordered an XL and it is much too small -- and I am not that big.  Off to the consignment shop it goes.
1.0,This is for my gdaughter's wedding that is soon. I was so very disappointed when I received a royal blue instead of navy. Returned the first one reordered same week and received another royal blue. Someone needs to explain that there is a huge difference in royal and navy blue.
1.0,Too tight....cut off blood circulation
1.0,Dead on arrival
1.0,Falling apart after one washing.
1.0,Very disappointed. I wore this twice and it ripped down the front middle seam.
1.0,Couldn’t be a worse experience.
1.0,"I was so disappointed, I couldn’t wait to get these then they broke while I was installing on my watch. Returned sadly"
1.0,Returning it back
1.0,"This &#34;dress&#34; /tent is terrible. It's so big and has no shape to it. It has really large points on the side and makes you look really big. I tried to return it -- no deal. It became an ordeal. Bottom line, they kept offering to only refund me a small percentage and finally had to file a claim with Amazon to get my money back in amazon credit."
1.0,"I was so looking forward to getting these boots. However, when I opened the box, I was totally disappointed. The straps were black patent instead of leather as they appear in the picture. It threw the look of the boot off, was not what I was expecting. I immediately sent them back. If you don't mind that look, they are very true to size. I wear a size 6 and they were tight. I'd consider going a half size bigger.<br /><br />****update: A.N. pointed out that I received the ""Funtasma by Pleaser Women's Halloween Plunder-130X Boot"" instead of what I ordered. Make sure you order/receive the correct boot!"
1.0,"This hat is not the picture.  It is screened on very poorly and not sewn, on to a very cheap navy blue hat."
1.0,"These are not rubber, probably PVC or something awful that will melt into your skin if you wear it. They have the feel and smell of something purchased at Dollar Tree. (Cheap and lousy with dioxins)."
1.0,the material is horrible here
1.0,"Don't Waste Your Money. I gave this pair of shoes to my kid on christmas. One week later, the left lights are not working. I'm very disappointed, that was the only gift that he wants, and we have to wait so long to have them cuz we live in South America."
1.0,Broke right away. Cheaply made.
1.0,I did not get these exact glasses.  What I received was a very light shaded pair a greyish color of lense.  What I ordered was the yellow lense for night driving.  Very upset!
1.0,Way too small and didn't look anything like the picture!
1.0,I've decided to keep the  velerose cutting off boot shoes
1.0,"I followed the measurement charts &amp; reviews &amp; item is still a bit large, which is fine because at least I can still wear it as a comfy shirt. Material for shirt is soft &amp; comfortable. I was expecting angled sleeves as in the picture but they are more shaped like a men's t shirt. So very square &amp; unflattering. The &quot;shirring&quot; does not exist - though the shirt does v down in size at bottom so it's a little more fitted at waist so if you bunch it you might be able to get the illusion of shirring. Shirt collar, shoulders &amp; sleeves are slightly unevenly sewn together."
1.0,"The dress is a total mess, I put my dress in the washer and following all directions but by the time I took out if the washer  elastic pieces were coming out of the seams"
1.0,"This sweater looks nothing at all like the picture.  In fact, when I first got it, my first thought was I didn't order this -- I couldn't tell if it was a men's sweater or women's.  The fabric was completely different, so the large size of it didn't fit like a slouchy sweater and the body was much shorter than what is pictured.  The sweater I received is unrecognizable as the sweater pictured and described."
1.0,They are beautiful but I have long hair and they rip the hair out at the base of my neck very painfull
1.0,Too flimsy/ the adjustable band is really weak.
1.0,"I normally wear a 2x and based on the reviews saying they run small I ordered a 4x.  I received them today and we’ll be lucky if they fit my mom who wears a size medium!!!!<br />They run very, very, very small!!!!"
1.0,This was very cute but I only had it about a week before it broke sadly.
1.0,"After my daughter tried it on, she had rashes and it was itchy. Returning it"
1.0,Too expensive at any price.  These really are thin with little ability to absorb.  At least in south Florida in the summer they last 5 - 10 minutes.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I finally got my shirt a month after I ordered it. Tried it on. I'm size 12, ordered XL fit slightly large until I washed and dried it. Needless to say it is now worthless!  I can barely get it on! My fault for not reading the tag. But it didn't appear or feel like something that would have done that so bad. So Beware!"
1.0,Fell right off every time I tried to wear it to bed
1.0,It says to order a size bigger don't do it!
1.0,"Not the same shape, no the same lace/quality in the photo - Poor quality"
1.0,"So, the large mentions a sleeve size of 62 cm however my large size coat that arrived yesterday is almost 71cms. Sleeves are hanging out. So obviously I am returning this"
1.0,I was super bummed.
1.0,This was way too small for use by an adult unless you wanted  mask hanging against your chin! I thought it was going  to choke me
1.0,I ordered the yellow and it would be a cute and well-fitting bathing suit if it did not have completely visible black padding in the top. Not sure why they would make it like this but it looked ridiculous and had to return.
1.0,I wish I can return this product due to material quality. It feels like a plastic shopping bag.
1.0,Its not red like in description.  Its burgundy
1.0,So sheer and cheaply made
1.0,No flag
1.0,"This is beautiful as shown, HOWEVER the skimpy thin screw back works barely on one earring and not the other.<br /><br />What a crazy useless offering!  Bleck!  USELESS JUNK"
1.0,The illustration on the hat is great but very disappointed with the material it states a winter hat and it is far from that
1.0,The seams tear easily.
1.0,It did not fit and it cut my tongue!
1.0,Disliked thickness and the way the toe is finished . Instead of decreasing the number of  stitches to create a toe the manufacturer has pulled up a section of the bottom and created a seam across the top of the toe. No way you could wear these socks with shoes. Maybe with boots but they bunch up.
1.0,They keep slipping down when I wear them.  Makes then unusable
1.0,"The first time that I wore them , they fell apart.  Very poorly made"
1.0,"Horrible!  Absolutely nothing like the photo.  Cheap polyester, bright orange."
1.0,"If I could give this a zero i would! I ordered a large and it came so tiny only a baby could fit into it! The top is not sewn either, very poor item 😢  don't waste your time and money"
1.0,"I bought these as a gift, but they were so cheap and cheesy looking.  I decided to just keep and toss them.  Certainly not what I expected."
1.0,Cheap. The prongs were bent and the stone looks like plastic
1.0,"* Not as expected. Hat was received totally crushed ad wrinkled with no paper work included to return.  Will try to correct condition, not worth it to try to return."
1.0,The size from the company is not for American men measured and it was still to small will not purchase here again
1.0,This is nothing but a slip
1.0,Really disappointed. It's cheaply made and the lettering isn't even straight and is partly cut off at the top of the charm. Won't recommend this seller. I feel very ripped off.
1.0,Wasn't the dress I ordered. Completely different style and color and it wouldn't even go over my head. It's sized like a child's dress.
1.0,Don't like it.  You can tell its a pill maker too
1.0,"My daughter wears size large , bought xxl , way to small, fabric and overall quality terrible!!! Should be mentioned its kids size!!!! False advertisement!!!"
1.0,One of the sleeves is significantly shorter than the other. Otherwise I like the dress and the color and it fits well. But I probably won’t be able to wear it because the one sleeve is a couple inches too short on one side.
1.0,Def cheap material. Was not worth the $27 I paid for it. It should have been $10 or less. Not happy
1.0,I ordered the 5x thinking about the size difference and the jacket was still too small. Very upset about the size problem.
1.0,"I love the goggles but the nose plug they threw in doesn't match the goggles. :( Sorry, but I'm a chicky who likes to coordinate and get what she's shown in the picture she made her decision to order from.<br /><br />Send the matching nose plug (black) for my silver googles instead of the one I received (blue) and your rating will be 5 stars. Thank you. :)"
1.0,Material is thin. Rips easily. Not a good material for winter. Pockets are hard to get into. Bought these for my husband and we are not happy with them. We do NOT recommend. Will not buy again.
1.0,Terrible costume. I am usually a size small but this bodysuit didnt fit in a small at all. If you have long torso the bodysuit will will be all up on your crotch and there is no snap at the crotch so you have to take the whole thing off to go to the bathroom. The mask looks silly and was just terrible quality. I still went as cat women but just painted the mask to my face and used random black stuff that I already had in my closet and made it work. DONT BUY THIS IS CHEAP AND TERRIBLE.
1.0,These are very short. They apear longer in the picture.
1.0,this cam and it is all mixed up and unable to be worn or at least stay on
1.0,Too small and bad material
1.0,"Great idea, but the plastic latch breaks after a couple of months. I wouldn't buy again."
1.0,"While this necklace has nice colors and design, the quality is very very poor. For starters, the item came to me ALREADY BROKEN. I attached some images that shows the necklace as I took it out of the wrapping. I could tell this was not damage caused by shipping because the item was very properly wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a thick box. On the other hand as I picked it up I could feel it was very light and flimsy, something that would definitely break on the first wear. The pearls were poorly glued because the pearl didn't break it just got loose and fell off. The bib parts on the other hands, made from Acrylic I believe, were broken in half, and one of them also fell off because I'm guessing it was also poorly glued. Conclusion: Don't buy this product!"
1.0,"Pretty, but wore it one day and the fastener broke."
1.0,You know how we're supposed to start being better at buying quality clothing and not purchasing throw away garments that will just end up in the trash or thrift store?  This garment is crap.  It is serged together with a big stitch and feels like crud.  It is not soft (but is stretchy like the product's description).  This is my final purchase of any garment without trying it on first with Prime Try Before You Buy.
1.0,The bow tie and suspenders were different shades of red. I had to go to store and find a bow tie that better matched the suspenders.
1.0,It came in broken . It won’t lock and it’s very very small .. I just didn’t had time to return it .
1.0,Ordered adult large and got a youth medium
1.0,They showed up defective and I didn't notice them until I wore them for the first time and accidentally sliced my ear open. I'm pretty upset that I paid for something that didn't show up as expected and it hurt the customer (me) in the process. Not okay.
1.0,"although pretty this product was very cheaply made, once opened it couldn't not be closed without a lot of trouble and then once closed any slightest bump would pop it back open again..... honestly I would never buy this product again and if I hadn't thrown the packaging away I would have returned them."
1.0,Just don't flattering on me. It was cheap material.
1.0,This shirt does not scoop like the one pictured...
1.0,Too complicated to use. Didn't like the quality and the silver part that holds the belt broke.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:33417a8544345b37526f75c871c428af]] Tiny-est pair of man shorts I've ever seen. Ordered a 2XL; the waist it a little wider than my Mac keyboard. Knee-length?? Not even close. I'm not even going to try to wear these! I may give them to my 12 year old daughter.
1.0,I purchased two of these rain suits for my husband and the first one ripped so we purchased another and the same thing happen again. Will not purchase another one.  Very disappointed
1.0,These are not child size. They are large on an adult. If your buying for a child you are wasting your money here. Now I get the hassle of doing doing return.
1.0,"It was beautiful on screen, but seem to be cheaply made . Sometimes you get what you pay for ."
1.0,They bent and the sharp part of the deers tail dug into and created a hole in my daughters ear. Then the earring back dug another hole.
1.0,Product (white color) delivered with black marks and several yellow stains like they were used. Returned.
1.0,"This suit is... interesting. The seems are too thick, the waist area to short, the chest too large with cups too small... I feel like the dimensions are all off"
1.0,"I was so exited to order this outfit for a causal fall outing but when it came, the colors were so off! The blue hem didn’t match the blue in the shirt. The blue in the shirt didn’t match the blue in the bottoms! Horrible and not worth it."
1.0,Wore them for a day. Out Of no where the blue of the lenses started<br />Yo fade to the point I can’t even see out of them. There are no scratches just the polarization is wearing off within a day of me wearing them such a let down
1.0,Cheap and came with the frame significantly scratched
1.0,The frame broke easily after a few days.
1.0,"Cheaply made. I can find something better at a thrift store. The wire that sort of gives structure to the deep v neck, feels like it's going to go through the fabric and stab my ta-tas!!<br />It was like wearing an old underwire bra that has the wire poking through and could cut the goods at any time. Hard no from me!"
1.0,the hat looks very nice but I wear a 7 3/8 hat and it will not fit on my head unless i wear it completly open which makes it look very tacky from the back ... if you have a big head this will not work for you
1.0,This necklace broke after one wear.
1.0,"Wanted to love these socks unfortunately more than 6 have holes in them, and I didn’t realize until too late to return them. Bummer for me."
1.0,Plz Plz don't buy this s*** !! I ur spending ur money on a watch that looks and feels like u got it at a quarter machine. Can barely even fit in my hand it's made for five-year-olds. Plz don't buy this crap !
1.0,way too small and shrinks when you wash it
1.0,The ring was very small. Looks like a child's ring which I was not expecting.
1.0,"This product ruined my fine jewelry. I tried to clean a pair of Tiffany earrings, a silver ring that I purchased in Italy and several other pieces. This cleaner turned them all completely black. Don't waste your money or ruin your items."
1.0,"These broke within a day of purchase, with the wire becoming exposed, and eventually pulling out of the ear muff. Complete waste of time, and more importantly incredibly disappointing to my daughter, for whom they were a gift. The last thing you want to hear over Christmas break is &#34;why did they break daddy?&#34;"
1.0,"Nice Looking Very Poor Quality Control.  I have many watches including automatics like this one.  I also have another same brand K&S watch that looks well and also works well for a inexpensive all Chinese watch. .  This one however is just terrible.  For starters it didn't work out of the box.  After winding it as instructed, then moving it around to get the rotor moving, and pulling the crown in and out, the second hand would not move.  Before I gave up, I rapped it a couple of times into the palm of my hand. Meaning I hit my hand not an object.  On the third rap, it started to work.<br /><br />After taking a closer look I found serval major condition issues and have outlined them in the attached images.  First the lume dots on the hour markers all off center.  Some are on one side while others are on the other side of the center.  It is very obvious even at arms length.  The case had two deep scores or scratches on the back.  Finally the gold plating job is just terrible.  You can see either the plating bubbling or the case was poorly cast.  I may have been able to live with one of these issues, but not all four.  Because it was stuck when new, I felt it would fail prematurely.<br /><br />That said, I liked the look enough to send this back and order a replacement. I believe every product can come defective and I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  So I will update this review when I get it. But if it comes the same way, this review will stay the same.<br /><br />Images are included for your review.  Please look inside the red highlights for the described defects mentioned.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please indicate that by checking the appropriate box below."
1.0,"They fit on my face perfect but they are terrible for keeping the wind out of your eyes.... terrible...... at 40 mph.  My girlfriend was wearing a pair of my safety glasses, which I tried, and they did a much better job keeping the wind out. These are my new safety glasses and my safety glasses are my riding glasses until I can find a place that will let me take the glasses for a test run."
1.0,They do not fit properly and the no slip heel is not effective
1.0,"Bad materials, poor fit, strings sticking out"
1.0,"The dress is cute, but it came out of the package dirty. It also smelled like sweat. There were visible dirt marks on the dress. I washed it, it still has a lingering chemical smell. Its also much too small for the size i ordered."
1.0,Two of the bracelets broke after just 10mins or so wearing them. Two beads in the opal bracelet were clear and not opal. Very low quality and cheap.
1.0,Do not buy not even close to the picture
1.0,Complete and utter garbage. You get what you pay for. Doesn’t stay in mouth.
1.0,"Wife returned them, they were not as described, they were very big and heavy."
1.0,Too small in person .
1.0,It said that the product runs small but that wasn't the case it was too big for my daughter
1.0,"Cheap, never again ."
1.0,"im a small 120 pounds and 5'1. I am super small but this runs really small, so go up likw 2 sizes"
1.0,So cute and so disappointing they didn't fit. I had to return them (which was no hassle at all) even though I bought them TWO sizes bigger than my feet. I bought the largest ones they had and it didn't work out.
1.0,I bought this for a gift for my husband for Christmas. I broke the first time using. I would not recommend this product. I did return it right away.
1.0,Arrived not working. Hands Bent. New battery didnt help.
1.0,The shoes that arrived were two different sizes.
1.0,Far the most disappointing quality ever. They don’t even take returns!! Do not purchase!
1.0,"Too  big  and  long and  looks  nothing like the picture , material is  heavy and  large  armpit  holes are  looks  ridiculous"
1.0,I thought the shoes would be good but they don't have much support
1.0,Returned item too small even though they said it was large
1.0,"Pack arrived with pull tabs for the zippers missing which makes it impossible to open the compartment.  Pack does not seem to be a true 30L pack as it was very small.  Stitching was frayed and raveled in several places, especially around zippers.  Overall disappointed in this as I was wanting to use on a outing and now will not be able to.  Amazon should screen these claims of 3 day pack and quality, etc. before they allow sale."
1.0,me quedo pequeño y el color no era el que esperaba
1.0,Sadly I couldn’t get it to heat!
1.0,No llegó nunca
1.0,Very poorly made. Not worth the price I paid.
1.0,I wish I could give it zero star. Don’t buy it!
1.0,"My dress was not cotton at all, more polyester and came all snagged. This definitely should have made the damaged pile. I did try it on and it was snug in the bust. I ordered a medium and wear a 6/8 34C chest. Cute concept but poorly executed."
1.0,This took almost a month to receive.  The shorts did not fit.  When I looked at the tag to see what the size was it was cut out. Would not order from this company again!
1.0,"The spikes are dangerous. Family member accidentally stepped on the mask after it fell off the table ,the spikes which are metal when into his foot! It was bloody.dangerous!"
1.0,They stretched out by the third use.
1.0,At this price I assumed it'd be 2 pieces<br />It looks like others have had the same assumption.<br />It looks good but I need a set and for the price I can get different sets.
1.0,"Crap design, crap chain very chinsy, tiny pendant, poor design. Will never order from this vendor again"
1.0,"It certainly looks off with the plaid showing at waist down to where it ends. It should be “peaking” out the bottom not half of the shirt. It looks weird and I can’t seem to wear it without feeling self conscious. It isn’t flattering this way. It may look cute on the model, but on my body in reality world it looks a bit odd! Maybe some of you could pull it off with a shorter torso, I am long torsoed and couldn’t do it.<br /> The quality isn’t bad, it’s a modest shirt, which is why I ordered it. I’m sad I can’t wear it.<br />I am 5’4 1/2”, 150 lbs."
1.0,Zipper and surrounding material seemed to be melted
1.0,"The lenses were fuzzy, they were flimsy and not the same quality as 2 years ago's order."
1.0,The quality of construction on these is questionable.  I found the to be really flimsy.  Don't foresee them lasting too long.
1.0,"The seam in the crotch unraveled the first time my daughter wore them and the back zipper separated with the first washing so I just had to sew it shut permanently. My daughter loves them, but she’s six and doesn’t have very high expectations.<br />Disappointed because they weren’t exactly cheap."
1.0,"Well... It broke when I first put it on. I DO NOT recommend this for long time use. If you want to only where it once then... Get it. I think it is a waste of money, personally"
1.0,Was nothing like described. It was like a slip and way too short and small
1.0,Nice sweat shirt but ordered a medium and got a XL.....
1.0,Jaw part<br />Broke within a day. Returned it.
1.0,Broke after wearing for two months
1.0,Poorly sewn.
1.0,I show a picture but they’re already in the box for return they were supposed to come yesterday which was the next business day after I requested a return for free pick up they said if you’re not home they’ll leave labels I was home all day no one ever knocked on my door I live on the third floor right clearly stated and they left the labels three of them on the floor downstairs
1.0,"I liked the overall design of the product. It looked especially great online. However, when I received the sunglasses in the mail and opened the box, the ear piece was broke. The box it came in seemed perfectly fine, so it leads me to believe the ear piece was broke before it was put in for shipping. Also, the eye glass protection seemed a little cheaper than I would prefer. I am currently returning. (Usually not a negative person but I have to say it how it is.)"
1.0,Not recommended. As soon as I put the leg warmers on one of the pair came loosen and treat came off. I had to return it and paid $6 for return. So i’ve Paid almost double for it and couldn’t use it at all. It looks really nice when u look on picture but it turned out not on my end.
1.0,This was just not a very good dress even for a costume the quality was low I bought it for my 16 year old daughter and you could literally see through the dress so I returned it.
1.0,"Picture makes them looks details and pretty. They are the cheapest, crappiest looking things I’ve seen. Looks like a black plug with a sticker on it."
1.0,Worked great for a month until the zippers broke :(
1.0,"My daughter was so excited to wear this, and then the strap broke off the dress the same day."
1.0,Did not fit and had been rusty upon arrival
1.0,If I were a size two these might work for me but I'm a size 6/8 with hips and all.  I looked like a sausage stuffed in a casing and the inseam was super short.
1.0,The dress only can fit six years old I will size small I guess I just give it to somebody else !<br /> Fits little girl maybe 13 years old but she still need to wear T-shirt underneath it does not look like the picture !
1.0,Not worth the money! I wore it for less than a week & it fell apart. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Supposed to be yellow with orange details, clearly a terra cotta orange all over. Only printed on one side, so the white unprinted side shows when you wear it. Looks and feels cheap. I guess the world needs cheap kimonos, but just don’t misrepresent your product and charge $22 for it."
1.0,"I ordered the medium for my husband and small for me. There is a huuuuuge gap between the two sizes. I was swimming in the medium and I could barley get the small over my thighs (there is no way i can sit down in this costume). The top half is overly large too (pic doesn’t do justice). I just want to know who has skinny short legs and a long fat torso to fill this costume out properly!? Don’t even get me started on the itch level. The mask is trash, but we knew that from other reviews & plan to wear the mask on our arms anyways.<br /><br />I wish I could return.<br /><br />I’m normally size 0-1, xs, b boobs, 5’3, 115 lbs, athletic build.<br /><br />This costume was not made with any thought."
1.0,VERY CHEAP LOOKING
1.0,"Cheap material, extremely small for a &#34;large&#34;. It can fit my 6 year old son. Definitely does not have the boho look."
1.0,Defect noticed hours after putting the gold pair on; small hole in the mesh close to a seam.<br />Poor QC at this sweat-shop mfr!
1.0,I bought this in XL.  The actual size was more like a medium than like an XL.  Cheaply made and sshrank a lot when I washed it.
1.0,Super cheaply made and easily loses its shape
1.0,"Didn’t even get to wear it one week before the chain broke when being adjusted. It was very difficult to adjust when I was able to wear it for a few days, so it was frustrating from the start. Do not recommend."
1.0,El pantalón me llegó dañado tuve q regresarlo
1.0,Had this luggage for just over 2 years bought it 7-19-17. Have taken it on about 5 trips. 1st trip one of them got a dent and crease in it but just figured no big deal it all still works well on this last trip I took on 6-30-19 the wheel ripped right out of the luggage. Not just a broken wheel but the case broke off with the wheel. I can't believe it lasted such a short time.
1.0,Suck product
1.0,Normally I wear 6 jeans and medium tops. I ordered XLR based on the posting. The top seemed like a true XLR but the bottoms were a Brazilian style cut ( almost thong) and more like a small. I returned item.
1.0,Do not purchase this top unless you have huge arms! I ordered a small and the sleeves look ridiculous! Arms are not shaped properly and each band sticks out about 2 inches looking ridiculous.
1.0,I returned these. The material was more appropriate for Fall. These fit small. The material is heavy and bulky.
1.0,Why do they have to make a child'd costume with fabric that is so uncomfortable?  This didn't make it to Halloween!
1.0,It really is a piece of junk.
1.0,Worst shoe ever
1.0,It either works or it doesn’t. They either love it or they hate it. That is the case with most sensory products unfortunately. It’s just trial and error. I resisted trying these things until just recently for my 8 yo. He did not like the feeling at all. He kept it on for 2-3 hours but could not wait to get it off. Onto another idea I guess.
1.0,This item is nothing like the picture of the hoodie!!! It’s thin as paper...highly upset because this was a gift to my daughter!!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e20db27c4af117eab484feee4c7b35fa]] Garbage
1.0,"Products came scratched, holes are drilled off center so they cannot attach to each other, and are insufficient weight to properly hold down curtains.  I wanted these for outdoors, and the poor coating will be problematic and result in corrosion.  Furthermore, I had problems with the Sellers -- please see me separate review of the seller.  In all, I would avoid the product and the seller."
1.0,I bought 2 pair of capris ( same seize )  at the same time. They both arrived at my house on the same day. One pair was perfect. The other pair (suppose to be the same size ) was extremely size. They look like they would fit a child. Very disappointed in the huge difference in sizes of my purchase.
1.0,This band is cheaply made.  The material was not soft at all.  And the stem that is used to adjust the length of the band was so short it didn’t stay in.  Very dissatisfied..... returned for a refund.
1.0,Not true to size at all I ordered toddler size for my son and they're HUGE!!!
1.0,This outfit comes small so you need to go up 2 sizes
1.0,Too small. Cut funny
1.0,I went with this $20 mask over a $6 mask at party city thinking the quality was much better. But after receiving it it is one of the worst quality masks made I’ve ever seen.
1.0,"I read reviews and realized i needed to buy one size up, So normally a large or and XL I bought the XXL. I think the top portion of this is a very nice, it fit well and looked good. However, the cut of the dress and the fabric of the skirt is really bizarre, like so many other reviews said the skirt is massive and way too full. Firstly the waist was really high (almost like empire waist) which might have worked but for the very stiff, starchy hard fabric that the skirt part is made of which created a very wide almost puff ball illusion all the pleats in this skirt (not flattering) didn't help either would have been alright if the fabric was light and flowing but hard and starchy meant i am already curvy so this shaped made me look like Humpty Dumpty! Returning it since Humpty is not my style."
1.0,Looks nothing like the pictures on Amazon.
1.0,Absolutely loved that it is a little more feminine than other options but not full on flowers. No complaints until... I wore this band for over 1 month before I started noticing a little red spot on my wrist. It didn't bother me so I didn't think much of it but each day it got more red and bumpy. It is from the the metal on the back closure post.
1.0,They look cool on.  I can’t wear them for more than two minutes without getting a headache.
1.0,"The bust is far too small for anyone over a C cup. Don't waste your money because apparently, they don't give you a full refund on a return."
1.0,It took less than 3 weeks to wear a hole in the top. They look nice but I'm not even doing the
1.0,"Received purse yesterday. Went to use this the first day and the zipper on the front disintegrated! I mean, completely fell apart. Don't order such a POS! I would stay away from other items of theirs if it is this shotty."
1.0,Ordered a size too big for me and they were still way too small.
1.0,I’d give a zero if I could ... garbage... do not buy!!!
1.0,"My wife got this for me.. Wore out of the box new and within 4 hours fabric had tore and now big hole in toe, plus did the bigger of the 2 sizes and they are TINY! I am only a size 10 and these are feel like a small woman's size. NO WAY if you are a guy with a size 9 or larger are these going to fit without tearing!"
1.0,Small for a child not adult
1.0,"First pair I received back in July was okay, a tad small. Just received several new pairs direct from CC and they are all way to small. Significantly smaller than my original pair. I have to send them back and pay for shipping too to get any refund. The picture on the package is very deceptive."
1.0,"Gorgeous dress, fell apart at every seam the first time I wore it-Not just some seams...every single seam"
1.0,Flip floor are very stiff no flexibility at all
1.0,Maybe I have a small head.  This hat is too big.
1.0,"The fit was awkward. Too short but then too wide with material that was like pajamas, which may be comfortable but does not look professional as I had hope to wear this to work."
1.0,More studs on picture than actual item. Sleeves are short and not best quality
1.0,Received these as a gift and they broke within an hour of wearing them. I was trying to delicately readjust them on my ear and it broke from the post.
1.0,Very poorly made. I would be embarrassed to wear this hat in public. Refunds on merchandise like this are impossible to obtain from the Asian supplier. Never again!!
1.0,It fit very strange almost like it was one of those items that was defective. Was tight across the chest loose everywhere else I don’t know it just fit very weird and I’ll probably never wear it but too much of a hassle sending stuff back so I’ll just hang it in my closet ....
1.0,I thought i was getting 3 barbells and it was only one. There should be a picture of just one. Overpriced for the one Quite disappointed.
1.0,"Well it's pretty easy to sum this one up. I order these white gloves, they take two days longer to get here then I was told, and when they do arrive both gloves are lefthanded. What am i supposed to do with that, wear one backwards? These people are incompetent, don't waste your money."
1.0,"I bought this replacement band for my 67-year-old mother whose original watch band had finally snapped. Even though this replacement band was not the exact color she was looking for, she was happy to have a band at all. Two days later, the replacement band came off the watch unit. My mom really wants to wear her watch, so she's been taping the band to the watch unit on a daily basis in order to keep it secure. This band does not securely fit the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro, therefore rendering it useless--unless you have tape! I'm shopping for a new one."
1.0,this is completely horrible! i am 5'2&#34; and the tights could not even reach up to my waist! they were so small on me! never purchasing from here again! uhughhhhh
1.0,It came broke and its very small
1.0,The dress was exactly what I wanted but was falling apart the moment I opened it. :(
1.0,Got the biggest size and was still too small
1.0,Cheap cheap material. I would not want these for free. Fit was good so it was a bummer.
1.0,When it was delivered it was crushed and the clip was broken and it was so mangled there was no way to fix it. The material almost feels like burlap and wasn't very nice. So I made my own and it was a million times nicer than this one.
1.0,They fit well to a point but would constantly have to be adjusted and eventually snapped at the left ear piece.
1.0,Started to dissolve in about 2 weeks of use. I'm not only dissapointed I'm impressed. I have never seen a product this bad. Breaking into tinny pieces after almost no use...
1.0,no la volveria a comprar
1.0,"Bad quality , waste of money"
1.0,Purchased it ahead of time in May for international travel. Wasn't used until July 14th to hold my passport. Despite the claims of durability the zipper broke on the second day of travel on July 16th which was beyond the return period. It's a shame because I had much more travel planned.<br /><br />Followup: Vendor reached out to me after this review and offered refund or replacement. I believe this will be a quality product and the first go round was not typical. They quickly replaced the item and have been very attentive in follow-up. Seem like a class vendor. I will not get to test out the product until we go out of the country again. That may be a few months off. But i will look forward to seeing how the newer version works and more importantly lasts.
1.0,Smells awful.<br />Pattern is NOT as the photo pictured.<br />Length was what I prefer. Only reason for the one star.
1.0,"The sizing not even close,"
1.0,The ring arrived today and has been boxed for return tomorrow.  The stone is green.  Roughly 1/4 of the stone is a brownish tan color.  It looks as if a chemical was spilled on it.  The stone looks nothing like the photograph.  I would have considered keeping the ring (despite it not being blue) if the defect in the stone hadn't made it unwearable. I've purchased other Chuvora items and been very pleased.  This product was very disappointing.
1.0,Too small for peoples with big hands can’t remember
1.0,"Thin material, that is see through.  Do NOT buy.  Awful placement of seams. Not sure if it’s a one eyed frog with a cheek nose or a one eared, one eyed frog.  One sleeve was extra long. Received after the last date i could return.  Was thrown away.  Sad that people will sell these kind of items."
1.0,Used it for 10 minutes in the office and afterwards the black color came right off. Quality isn't as expected or advertised.
1.0,"Extremely upset!!!!  Even though the package came early, which was great, however, the white writing is PINK!!!  My man is not going to wear it...Christmas gift RUINED!!!"
1.0,Cheap and not at all what the blogger presented in her story
1.0,not well made it is a flop
1.0,"Ai dise que esperan mi devolucion y me mandan etiqueta ,cuando nunca me llego que les boy adevolver si pedi mi reembolso porque dise que el paquete se perdio."
1.0,"There are different sellers listing this item, so your experience may be different, but I was very disappointed. The loupes I received were not SE brand as advertised, but a generic Chinese knock-off. If I want no-name, I'll buy no-name. This was fraudulent misrepresentation. The only good part of the purchase was that the return was easy. It is sad that one cannot trust that one will receive what is advertised, even if you choose a seller with excellent feedback."
1.0,Cute dress but looks and feels cheap. It's like a costume fabric.
1.0,Messy!  Disappointed.
1.0,Cute belt but hard to zip up! Its almost impossible!
1.0,Ugly cheap trashy... Wasn't worth paying the shipping to send back threw in donation box
1.0,Received a completely different item with the same material and color. I did not like the fabric. I returned it
1.0,The stone is larger than advertised it breaks real easy it's corners it's uncomfortable and pinches your finger
1.0,Runs extremely small and costs too much to return so I'm stuck with a dress I can't fit.
1.0,"Yeah It was a weird kinda cut, sent it back"
1.0,Small glasses<br />like big glasses
1.0,They look ugly and cheap won't even wear them they looked ok in pictures
1.0,Nose pad screw loosened & stripped within 3 weeks and rendered glasses useless. Bad design!
1.0,Not even  similar to the picture. .
1.0,"Very disappointed with these sunglasses. There is a huge glare, which makes it really heard to see.  Not a fan!"
1.0,"Beautiful garments, But too small for the average American women."
1.0,"The cuff of my earring was really flimsy and broke easily. This piece looked gigantic against my ear, and yet, it was too small to reach the top and bottom of my ear. I bought the golden dragon ear piece."
1.0,"Poor quality, I purchase 2 one for myself and for a gift. The have both come apart inside and the straps have come apart. I really love the look of this bag, and it was so embarrassing after giving this as a gift."
1.0,I really wanted to like this dress it was a good length and color and fit. But the material is too thin and see-through so it shows every thing. I am returning it.
1.0,"Fit way to small, no give"
1.0,Packaging was good but it didn’t fit.
1.0,"Looks like a mans flannel, short and wide. Does not look like picture at all. Could of got this at Walmart or my dads closest."
1.0,ORDERED AN XXL  FIT LIKE A MED  BUYER BEWARE
1.0,I keep sliding in them and not good material cheap
1.0,Not like pictures at all garbage
1.0,"This was not the luggage for me. I used it once and the IT label came apart. Not only that, but it had black marks all over it so it appeared extremely old and used even though it was new. Top handle started to tear off after the first use as well. II will not buy this color/product ever again."
1.0,"Runs very large and poor material.  You do get what you pay for , but expected the size to better. I ordered a 3t and was much larger."
1.0,Doesn’t fit well to large doesn’t match with the breast ending
1.0,I know it was inexpensive but I thought it should have been better made. Has plastic for the glass/lense
1.0,Chane broke after a week
1.0,This product was not delivered as described and was of such poor quality that all but 2 of the masks are unusable.
1.0,"The print on this shirt is like wearing a smooth sheet of plastic or paper that holds it's square shape and makes a loud paper shuffling sound every time you move. Looks great if you don't move. I really wanted to like it, the shirt is fine and the print is at least crisp and as is presented in the listing pics. But I'm very disappointed in the quality of the print enough to return it."
1.0,The lenses in these frames are mottled or blurry or something
1.0,Came later than expected. They barely fit my daughters 6 year old foot. Too small IMO. But the dealbreaker was that she put her foot in the shoe and immediately complained that she could feel them and that they were hurting. The ends of the laces are metal and aren’t the most conspicuous. So we tooo them out and out in her regular laces again. Ended up purchasing a different brand of no tie laces which actually work well and can’t feel them.  Buyer beware.
1.0,"These shirts are made very small, I went a size up and got a Large and they were made for a child."
1.0,I could not get it to fit my very small wrist.  The security bands were in the way.  I was unable to close the band without using a pair of tweezers to pull the security bands over the end of the strap.
1.0,It broke and I am sending back for refund
1.0,"I really wanted to like these. I don’t know if I got a defected one because one of them seemed fine, however the other just wouldn’t stay clasped down and would just come off."
1.0,String on the side broke off the first time worn. Garbage. Should have asked for a refund but daughter needed to wear fir a skit like the others and we had to use a safety pin.
1.0,"Shirt was nice but the sizing was way off, I take a XX size shirt, ordered a XXX because I wanted it to be loose but it fit me tighter than a XX."
1.0,These are very cheap looking
1.0,"I bought this shirt in black and it fits great, but I washed it and this weird yellow dye is in it. It ruined the white lettering. I bought the same shirt in white and it fits a little on the snug side. I bought the same size for both. Not happy with either."
1.0,Way to small even a 3xl
1.0,Broke within the first week. Very cheaply made. Dont last.
1.0,Too small for size ordered
1.0,I bought these for my husband. He has been wearing 36 shorts in every brand but he’s lost weight so they have been hanging off. I was looking for a size 34 or 35 and found these. The cut on these shorts were off.  They appear too run small.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:b5b8062f1930fcbab94eabe4f8bef2ca]] Absolute waste of money💔. 1st problem was the bra said ""Delivered May 26"". It didn't arrive until today, June 9th. (2weeks after it said delivered- so a total of 3weeks bc I had to wait a week from when I bought it til when it said it'd be here). Then I get it, I'm like ooh finally it's here!! ....the bra is TINY. I ordered a 34C which is what I typically wear. The bra barely has a cup. I put it on anyway just to see if maybe it fit.. no, it doesn't. It looks like I took a training bra & put it on. The straps in the front do absolutely nothing but hook in the front for looks, which was the whole reason I thought it would be better than other strapless bras... I hope y'all do some improvements on the product and shipping."
1.0,Broke within the first week of wearing. The lenses keep popping out! Terrible quality
1.0,They were cute at first but they started falling apart the very first day. By day 2 they were completely torn apart and I only wore them around the house
1.0,"This hate is REALLY REALLY small.  I have an average sized head, too.  Not happy.  Returned."
1.0,It ripped on the first wash!
1.0,Durability is terrible on this lanyard.  The safety breakaway broke on it within 6 months. The clip adjustable length broke next .  Finally unusable after trying to fix it myself.
1.0,"Very large. It came a week late, it missed the reason I bought it for a Christmas party. Disappointed."
1.0,"Nothing like picture, can’t even wear it. Waste of money"
1.0,It would be nice if it worked
1.0,It’s not comfortable where the device sits on your head in this hat. And you can see the lump. Wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,These do not stay in place. They slip toward the watch face and eventually off the band during activity. I will not purchase again.
1.0,It looks like mine has a dirty finger print is on it.  The color does not match the picture. I'm not to happy with it.
1.0,I thought this would be cute with leggings thru the holidays.  It is terrible.  I am an average size...usually around 12.  I ordered the x large.  It is a tight tshirt.  Not long...not all drapey like the photos.  I am assuming to get the look they have an average woman would need a 5X.  I wont risk it to find out.  I am going to donate it to goodwill and maybe some small short person can use it.  I am also contacting Amazon thay they need to stop dealing with this seller.
1.0,Doesn't seem very warm. Was very hard to zip up or down. Not flattering at all...
1.0,Charger on shoe fell off second time my daughter wore them. Now useless.
1.0,"poor quality fabric, color is the same as on  picture, but quality of fabric makes it look soo cheap.  the dress is not long  as shown , its  much shorter with makes it look"" funny""  I think amazon should  take it seriously, when third party sellers sell  things  totally different from advertising .  i wasted my time and money  on this purchase.  now have to drive to ups  to return it. not happy at all"
1.0,These don’t fit like women’s pants. They fit my husband better than they fit me. The sizes they offer are strange - 33 x 31 for example - which is how menswear is sized.
1.0,Doesn’t stick well and doesn’t lift hardly at all
1.0,Cheap material don't waste you money for the price it's not bad but not sturdy enough for everyday carrying things
1.0,"This is not the same as the Hontao version. It’s a poorly made copy, I have both side by side. Very disappointed with the quality of this Ritche model. The material I wanted was out of stock with the Hontao brand, so I thought I’d just get one of these assuming it was just a different name. Totally different."
1.0,"Dress fit great (not tight at all), looked great, comfy & easy...  the seam ran up the back center, first wear the dress ripped about a foot at the seam (in public) when I sat down-  I had to have someone stand behind me and escort me out.  Note to self, if a deal looks too good to be true, it is."
1.0,looks nothing like the picture. Short sleeved and awfully thin material.
1.0,Extremely disappointed in the product I received. It appears that this sweatshirt is embellished with sequins but don’t let the photo fool you. Everything you see is screen printed. I will be returned.
1.0,Super itchy fabric. And it’s the type of fabric that attracts every piece of hair and lint around. Horrible quality.
1.0,"Very cute but the boots run very large, even with returning and ordering a smaller size.  The foot of the boot has a lot of excess material."
1.0,The top is ok but the bottoms are small
1.0,The style of the dress was very nice. The measurements for the shoulders and breast were too small.
1.0,I got them home and tried them one and the cup size was extremely small. It was a bit sad.
1.0,Purchased to wear to work on Halloween since we make and sell anchors. It was so cheap and all folded up into a tiny little package. Had to return. Might work for someone else though.
1.0,I wear a size E andbthats what u ordered but it's way to samll.  This product would be great for small chest
1.0,"The stone was lose, and the ring was very flimsy. There were no stamp of sterling silver authenticity. I was very disappointed."
1.0,"Really large, tacky, & cheap looking. I would have returned them but my little one picked them as a gift for her aunt (which her aunt very graciously accepted)."
1.0,Gets easily scuffed but you get what you pay for. Didn't want an expensive one as I change the shoe every 6 months for size 🙂
1.0,Terrible quality. Its made out of cheap acrylic. It has the appearance of a Brillo pad. I Will be sending it back and not buying from this seller
1.0,This ring tarnished in the box before it came out of the box at Christmas. I would NEVER buy this again!!!
1.0,"The image is completely off center on the shirt, the “sh” in cash are the center, stinks I just put it on since I placed the order just over a month ago and can’t return it. I’d be happy to alter my review if the company will make it right"
1.0,Sizing is WAY off and dress is a shirt size. I am beyond sad.
1.0,Parts that hold the band on my Fitbit broke off. Mold grew in the grooves.
1.0,Very poorly made. Grommets fell off with 1 washing. I also ordered another style of these pants and they arrived with a huge hole in the inseam.
1.0,2 year old Grandson could not use them because they would not stay on his feed while walking
1.0,It does not come with the bow or a belt to make one. My sister had ordered the same dress from a different company and it came with a belt but it was cut Little disappointing
1.0,They fit like girls underwear. I thought I had gotten bikini ones. It's only one quarter of an inch wide top band. Complete and utter disappointment
1.0,Completely wrong dress and horrible smell. I took this out of a ripped cheap bag all balled up and wrinkled. There is a terrible smell I would put somewhere between rubber and plastic and chemicals. The dress is a wrap around loose v neck open back dress that is what appears to be flowy not even close to the image shown or the description. The material is like what id equate to a costumey attempt of satin .. I honestly didn’t even try it on because of the smell and the condition. I don’t even want to put it on my body it doesn’t seem sanitary. This was by far the worst amazon item I’ve received. Not just because the item was completely wrong but because it’s actually something I wouldn’t even try on for the reasons mentioned.
1.0,"This is not 3/8&#34; as advertised, it is at least 1/2&#34; which is too large for me to wear. Also the color of the stones is nearly black, not the pretty purple color in the picture. Waste of money."
1.0,"It even says it on the tag. The little metal ring in the top center, and the metal loop in the back are clearly cheap, old, and make this top look like it's been sitting in a warehouse for years. Construction is poor; if you could see this item in person and a foggy photograph wasn't hiding the poor stitching jobs wherever straps intersect, you wouldn't pay more than $3 for it."
1.0,Good concept but there is not enough extra fabric at the top to keep my bra from not showing. Also you have to thread the belt through a hole they make in the side but it still shows your skin through the hole. It looks like the dress is riped even though it's not. It looks pretty but just not well designed.
1.0,I was very disappointed with these leg warmers. They were extremely small and I ended up giving them to my young granddaughter.
1.0,"These were listed to be a certain size. Unfortunately, that size includes the hook! Its tiny. Do not have time to send back and get something else due to need to wear this to a ceremony."
1.0,Go to good will and find better at the 99 cent isle.
1.0,"I wanted to like this dress, but the material felt too stiff and fitted too long on my 5' 2&#34;, 145-pound frame."
1.0,I like the item but it is not even close to the color shown so now i have to find one the right color
1.0,It plainly says in the ad “one package of three shirts”<br />I received one shirt not three that is why I am writing this one star and will probably send it back or return
1.0,Returned product since I ordered wrong color. Style was perfect.
1.0,I liked it but didn't hold up it felled all apart two days later the diamond felled out
1.0,Return period is a concern if you are ordering in advance of any event
1.0,The dress was nothing like the picture
1.0,These are cute but basically disposable. I wore them 3-4 times and the golden plating was already almost gone! yes they were cheap but I thought they’d last at least a few months!
1.0,Wasn't a real crystal!
1.0,"Put it on for the first time this AM.  My wife noticed right away that it had something white on the back of it.  It had white spots on the back of it...  see photo.  Its coming back.<br /><br />Second thing... if you have a size 18 neck like I do, the neck is way too tight.  This is the first T-shirt I've ever had that was this tight.  Just measure a name brand shirt and copy their dimensions.  They must use the same neck size for all sizes.  (mine is an XL)  For pencil necks only...<br /><br />I bought two of these.. one Med and one XL.  The Med fit my son just fine.  Much skinnier neck."
1.0,"They should have listed the size/dimensions in the description (unless I missed it).  This thing is about a foot long and cheap looking.  I expected something looking &#34;Realistic&#34;, as the name suggested, but it's just a big plastic silly prop.  Hopefully I can return it."
1.0,Wasn't what I thought it was
1.0,Read carefully! You one get one earring! Very cheaply made. Don't waste your money!
1.0,"I think this is a cut off leg from some yoga pants. The material is not right at all and doesn't stay put when used as a mask. It's not easily stretched.<br /><br />This mask is NOT seamless as advertised. The pattern looks cool, I just wish it worked as described."
1.0,A very poor quality of fabric! Very much disappointed !!!!
1.0,Not organic. Cheap Chinese product. False advertising.
1.0,Beads seemed to be balsa wood covered in polyurethene. And the size delivered was incorrect. Beads were much smaller than described. Seemed to be 8mm.
1.0,What the??? It look like cheap doll clothes.
1.0,"Cute earrings, but....NONE of the backings fit onto ANY of the 3 pairs of earrings in this set. Disappointing. The backings are WAY TOO SMALL."
1.0,Horrible! period
1.0,"Unstained, line dissipated on both ends, line unparallel. Will be returning. Either other reviews were placed by seller or I received a defective unit. I would imagine the later is more common and most would be very disappointed."
1.0,"I should have read the reviews before buying...<br />1) the colors are done with two or more colors of yarn... unfortunately, the manufacturing process left long runs of threads on the insides to catch on your toenails as you put them on<br />2) my feet measures to 6 1/2 with and these are very very tight.  From reading the reviews (now) it sounds like the quality assurance for sizing is not there.<br /><br />Disappointed"
1.0,Broken after a week using it!
1.0,"Dropped once and the bottom hinge is now broken. Great concept, needs higher quality materials."
1.0,"This is a hard 1* review to write because the cosplay itself was beautiful. I have to return this though because when I received the product and tried it on, I found out the hard way there’s a pin SEWN INTO THE LINING OF THE COAT. I feel lucky this didn’t catch my eye and just got my forehead.<br /><br />Not thrilled about my Hu Tao cosplay trying to make me into one of her customers, as fitting to her character as that might be. I wish I could contact the seller to get a replacement coat. But, oh well. Let’s hope my next order goes more smoothly"
1.0,"The material was awful, it was poorly made and did not fit. I paid a fortune to return it after I was approved for a refund and eight months later, they shipped it back to me.<br /><br />These are CROOKS!"
1.0,My tween daughter used Christmas money to buy these.  Her finger turned black within 20 minutes of wearing the ring.  She is bummed and so am I.  We plan to apply clear nail polish in hopes that she will still be able to wear these rings for a while.
1.0,"Purchased this cropped athletic top thinking this would be great for workouts, but instead received this super weird, thin, see-through, and not the same item at all. Extremely disappointed in this item and the smiley face on the zipper is not what I was going for. Don’t buy this"
1.0,Has hole in it. Stitches are misaligned. Sleeves bunched up at wrist. Single stitch in most places. Sleeves are pulling apart. Camo pattern misaligned. Lines running across pattern with no dye. Elastic is stretched and missing die. Neck is way too tight. TOTAL GARBAGE. $10 Walmart hoodies are far better quality. DO NOT BUY waste of time and money.
1.0,The decal was bleed on the shirt.
1.0,I thought I was buying a winter coat. I was wrong. It's not warm at all. It would be excellent as a rain coat. But that's it. So if you want a cute raincoat this is the jacket for you. I got mine when I was 35$. And it wasn't worth the money. Very dissapointed.
1.0,This didn’t even make it out of the house before it broke.  Links are very cheap
1.0,not as picture.
1.0,Very cheap and poorly made product. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase.
1.0,Title summarized it
1.0,"This shirt is made out of a weird fabric that doesn't stretch that well. Its also shaped quite boxy rather than curvy. My shirt only had 1 button hole, which was for the second to last button. The way that the neckline is shaped makes it look like it needs the last two button to be closed which would be fine if they both had holes. But as I said there's no hole for that last button. My shirt is shorter than the picture shows. Its basically a different shirt than pictured.as you can see the color is also a lighter grey which I still like but its different than pictured."
1.0,Arrived a bit earlier than expected but unfortunately is already on its way out. My &#34;gray&#34; sweater came in a deep blue color and absolutely  reeks. Has little to no stretch in the body.
1.0,only had to get it wet one time and it turned black.
1.0,"Butt ugly and cheap looking. Just cheesy, if you like that look"
1.0,Could not even get this over my shoulders or hips. No stretch
1.0,Fabric is awful...  The fit was much more baggy then looks on the model.
1.0,Neck side it has deep open. Not fitted properly
1.0,This mask “not a helmet” is floppy and big.  It’s so big the mouth doesn’t even move.  Save your money.
1.0,Very poor quality. I regret purchasing..
1.0,Doesn't work well as a ring awfully thick seems cuter than it actually is
1.0,"this dress has a large exposed metal zipper on the back which looks and feels terrible.  also, be aware that this is shipped from china and now i will have to wait a long time for a refund."
1.0,It ran very small and the fabric was very see through. I returned it
1.0,Did not last. Not well made.
1.0,This literally snapped in half under the simplest amount of pressure as I was trying to make it fit snug to my face.
1.0,"It looks like jewelry from out of a bubble gum machine,very lightweight and cheap,don’t waste your money like I did."
1.0,Broke within a few days!
1.0,Literally the worst fitting swim suit I’ve ever tried on LOL it was quite comical it was so bad! Would give it a negative star rating if possible. Couldn’t send it back fast enough
1.0,The post is very long so that the ball on top sticks out too far.
1.0,Crappy material. Doesn’t fit well. Feels cheap
1.0,The stitching came undone after a few wears.
1.0,The pockets on the side were sewn in incorrectly.  Bad workmanship.
1.0,"I normally wear an extra small in joie , but even the extra extra small  in these was way too big, oversized and looked like a shapeless burlap sack. Not flattering at all."
1.0,I can wear both the small and large sizes of bands but this is smaller then a small size i wish I ordered the large.
1.0,Sizing chart said to order size S for a us 4 size. I am about a 2/4 in most clothes and these fit completely fine except the waist! I feel like I need to size up to a M or L. Super sad because they fit perfect everywhere else
1.0,"First of all, the flannel is not like the one pictures at all…the flannel pictured is actually sold in online boutiques so I am assuming they stole this picture from online. The flannel I received is a different color scheme and is super uncomfortable and itchy. It is more bulky and wide than what is pictured…not flattering at all and I am 5’3, 118 lbs just to give as a reference point. Returning."
1.0,Can’t get it over my head.
1.0,"The only reason I got these is so if my glasses fell off at the lake they wouldn’t sink.  Well, they sunk in my test in the pool.  Won’t be taking them to the lake for sure.  Tested with Maui Jim Stingrays.  Just basic mens sunglasses.  Waste of money."
1.0,Too small need chart of size to be sure
1.0,I never ordered this item!!! Was i charged!
1.0,Cheap material and very small for the size couldn't wear
1.0,"This bag looks nice, but the strap and buckles totally fell off after about 5 weeks. Very poor construction."
1.0,Horrible quality I bought these for my daughter as soon as she put them on it broke.
1.0,I don't know any newborn that this diaper would fit on nevermind 0 to 6 months! This could work for a preemie or maybe as a doll accessory. It is absolutely tiny!
1.0,Too thick and ver hot material
1.0,Very poor  quality don't buy it
1.0,Highly would not recommend.  Torn after one week.
1.0,"I purchased this dress for my bachelorette party, hoping the reviews were wrong and it would fit properly. It fit terribly and I wasn’t interested in adding alterations to a $20 skirt that was cheaply made to begin with. When I went to return the dress I was messaged an address (looked like a home address) by the seller, and I returned it. Almost month later with no return issued I contact the seller and they explained that they have satellite workers that help with returns but they can’t say if they have the returned dresses or not.<br />Just save yourself the headache. The dress is cheap and will not fit. You either can’t return it or will have to jump through hoops to try to."
1.0,"What exactly is this garbage? It looks NOTHING like the ad! It's thin, cheap material. Not even the same color! Wow, man! These aren't inexpensive,  they're cheap."
1.0,Size 14 fits like a size 6.
1.0,"You get what you pay for.  The only things good I can say about these bandanas are that I like the colors, and they did not bleed when I washed them.  However, 8 out of nine of them are now rags, because of the frayed edges.  The fabric is very thin, and stiff.  They need to be washed many times to get them soft, but they simply cannot stand up to repeated washing.  The cost of bandanas has skyrocketed, but I will keep looking."
1.0,Arrived broken. The buttons that cinch the straps came already broken.
1.0,Arrived broken. Returned item.
1.0,Very small! More for a toddler or very young child!
1.0,The scarf looks nice and I was excited to wear it after opening the package.  Then I spent the rest of the day picking lint of my shirt and beard.  I don't know how this thing produces such a mess. I beat the heck out of it and went over it with a lint brush but the thing still covers me in balls of lint.
1.0,"Simply placing back onto earring (which doesn't fit) bent the post & snapped off when I straightened it to get it out of my ear. Poorly made, or mine were made on a Friday afternoon. I tried putting the rubber backing on the other earring while in my hand & that's how I figured out it won't go on at all. I soldered the post back on the other earring & bent both posts down to wear without backing. At the end of the day, one earring was gone so I couldn't return them if I wanted... which is what I should've done when the post bent."
1.0,I needed a 2XL for my husband to wear in time for my kids party. The wrong size came in.
1.0,not as represented
1.0,Nice quality material .. just needed to size down
1.0,I got a dress that was clearly worn already. Deodorant stains on the armpit area and smells like  nasty sweat. 🤢 Dirty stains on it. Horrible.
1.0,Won’t strip like it should
1.0,i bought two for gifts both broke
1.0,Missing one of the turquoise stones upon arrival.
1.0,This description says it for 3-5 year old. I bought these for my 4 year old and they literally would be better fitting a baby than anyone over the age of 2. Beware.
1.0,BRACELET IS CUTE AN ALL BUT THE HEART CAME OFF AN I DONT KNOW WHEN I JUST NOTICED IT SMH GOT PUT THINGS A LITTLE TIGHTER
1.0,"This was actually great when it arrived, but after one wash, shrunk considerably. It is definitely NOT pre-shrunk cotton. Plan on buying at least 3 sizes larger than you want if you actually want this."
1.0,"The bracelet fell off my wrist due to the fact that it was too large and not bendable. When trying to bend, it started to crack. Cute look but cheaply made."
1.0,Too much spandex in the material. And fits weird in the seat area.
1.0,"Sizing is off couldn't wear them, my little one only wear a size 4 shoe, so it should've fit with no problem"
1.0,"Bought these socks because they claim to be sturdy. Hole in big toe on first walk. I have toenails, but they’re not talons. Way too expensive for such crappy quality. Can’t return. Will never buy again."
1.0,Nyah!
1.0,"The blouse arrived a wrinkled mess.  The quality of silk wasn't bad,  however it came shoved into a small package."
1.0,I cant figure out how to set the time or date. The instructions do not apply or help. I am sending this one back.
1.0,"This is horrible. I bought this for my school musical and it's falling apart, I've been brushing and and rebrainding and this thing sucks"
1.0,"The pockets sit pretty far back and low. It's like you have to push your arms down just to be able to reach it. I'm 5'7' and have never had this issue with any jacket except for this one. Definitely size up at least one, maybe two sizes."
1.0,"The bandanas are wonderfully large as advertised.  However, all of the patterns are printed on with what I will refer to as &#34;fabric paint&#34;.  I don't know what the proper term is; but the pattern is essentially a layer of plastic printed onto the bandana.  I wear bandanas all the time at the gym and when I got home the patterns on these bandanas were already disintegrating and flaking after the first time.  My hair was essentially filled with tiny white flakes like bad dandruff.  Even worse, I wear bandanas at the gym to absorb sweat.  Although these are supposedly made of 100% cotton, it hardly absorbed any of the sweat from my workout and was actually repelling water when I tried to wash these afterwards.  Sorry, but all of them are now in the trash.  Would've sent it back for a refund but i was already outside the return window."
1.0,I don't have a large head or a lot of hair but these were very narrow and actually cracked along bottom of both sides of lenses from wearing on my face. Lenses good. Fit narrow.
1.0,"I bought what looked like a beautiful, soft pink sweater for my daughter.<br />It’s a god-awful bright pink. No way will she wear this."
1.0,"i rated it poorly because it is falsly advertized. it refuses to sit on my ear correctly and its supposed to look like a snake curving around your ear but instead it looks like a deformed arrow. to me it looks nothing like a snake, if i hadnt already known what it was supposed to be i would have never guessed. i strongly recomend that no one buys this product."
1.0,Many of the rings just have weird blobs on them instead of a shape like they're supposed to. Save your money for something cuter.
1.0,"Wish  handle was longer, once you open it’s hard to wrap up again.<br />Not happy with this purchase. But will not return.update: this is junk doesn’t work money thrown away<br />Very disappointed:(update 10-2019<br />It’s already broken what a piece of junk;("
1.0,"I have a an extremely large head and normally have a hard time finding comfortable hats. This hat hung on my head and touched the top of my cheek bones! Honestly the hat could hold a basketball, no joke..."
1.0,"Crap. Broke first day. Pkg of 3, nine retract  properly."
1.0,"I was disappointed in this purchase, it stated that it was 925 sterling silver.it is clearly not sterling, the little chain that is the extension is the only part of it that is stamped sterling. the design is nice but the materials is cheap."
1.0,"These shoes are adorable and fit my almost 4 year old very well.  The problem is that after very little wear the cute bows fall off, leaving me with a crying girl who wants her favorite pair back.  I have hot-glued them back on more times than I can count.  Buy something more durable if your girl wants to wear these often."
1.0,"Was expecting it to be Hard PVC plastic…was actually a rubber.. smelly, mask.  I’m trying to get in contact with them to return it and get my money back…. But am having a hard time doing it.."
1.0,Sent these back because they were a little too big and the design wasn’t as cute as in person.
1.0,Big hole at the top. It is unraveling after one wear
1.0,I am a big fan of Walker & Williams and have several. But this is not one to buy. I'm going to complain to the company and try to get a replacement. The brown leather is fine but the black material is terrible quality and very quickly began to shred and fall apart. I end up with black flakes all over my shoulder after playing and the seams are coming apart.<br /><br />Skip this one It's really bad. The company should pull it.
1.0,"Very poor quality. My boys have been wearing these for less than two months, and the seams are coming apart. There are little strings coming undone everywhere."
1.0,The product was looking good but was broken when received
1.0,"This was sooooo long, but the waist was about as big as my wrist. Hated it. Sent it back."
1.0,It hurts my ear
1.0,Buy a better pair of shorts. I road in and washed these 6 times and they felt alright. But at this point the padding is next to nothing.
1.0,"Terrible fit, dull sequins, who wants that!!! Returned"
1.0,"Item exactly what wife needed... However, the zipper broke after only two uses.  Item is NOT recommended unless you don't care about bag left open."
1.0,"My foot twisted in these slippers when I stepped halfway on a curb, and I broke my metatarsal. Since my foot has healed, when I've tried wearing these slippers, I notice they do have the tendency to twist around the foot if you take a wrong step in them. I wish I'd purchased heeled slippers."
1.0,"This piece of SH#T band continued to come loose because of a crappy single button-type clasp until it finally came loose on me at a trade show conference and I lost my brand new Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro--out $150!  DO NOT BUY THIS or you will suffer the same consequence as I and lose your Samsung Gear Fit2 or Gear Fit2 Pro.  If I could force Pinhen to reimburse me for my Gear Fit2 Pro I would, but that isn't going to happen.  So, stick either with the original band or some other design that is much more secure than this."
1.0,This dress is terrible and cheap.
1.0,"Loved these when I bought these, but after a short period of time the pockets untraveled both the leg and the back pockets!"
1.0,I didn’t like this item because even though I bought it a large and in a medium bb it for too small
1.0,"Once received, looks cheap, too big."
1.0,I purposefully sized up on this product expecting it to run small. It was very short and very tight. Returned it.
1.0,"Screw came out of side of glasses, poor quality"
1.0,It did not fit<br />The worse thing for me is that I believed in their product and ordered over 10 of them
1.0,This watch is a piece of junk!!!!
1.0,The earrings themselves are super cute unfortunately I received mine with the jewel missing on one of the earrings.
1.0,too small wrong size fabrication
1.0,It's crap. Might as well make your own case with newspaper and duct tape
1.0,very cheaply made and do not retain shape - do not recommend
1.0,"Not only was this gigantic but all they did was cut out the material and sew up the seams. No finishing at all, not even at the neck! I have seen tents that were better made! Really a waste of money. Very disappointed!!!!!"
1.0,"I  was  really  looking forward to  wearing  this  dress,  I  wear  a  12/14  us,  I  ordered the  XL  and  it was  super  skin  tight,  but I  gave  it to  my  girlfriend  who  wears a  size  2  and  it  looked  great  on  her"
1.0,"watch was WAY TOO BIG for a ladiy.  It didn't state that it would be this big.  I also got the black on and it was the large style for not too big for a women -- the grey one is pretty but HUGH.  I'll keep it because for the price, it's not worth sending back but I will give it to a male to wear instead."
1.0,I only received 1 band. I returned the item for a refund.
1.0,Way to small.  I gave it to a friend.
1.0,Just ribbon attached to a metal clip. Not sturdy and even sewed to where the pattern is opposite when using it.
1.0,Quality of material is horrible. You pay for what you get.
1.0,One side of the cross is not painted. Otherwise it's a nice piece.
1.0,Very cute kimono however cut very narrow.  It wouldn't even go up over the sides of my breasts.  This is definitely for the slimmer and flatter women
1.0,"Bonitas pero, Súper incomodas para trabajar, lastima mucho Arriba del tobillo, están muy duras para agacharte, malas para trabajar , no las recomiendo"
1.0,"I have actually sent my bra back and didn’t order a new one, but I wanted to write and give others a heads up about the fit of these bras. I am usually a 38G, so I ordered a 38G. It fit horribly. Fit more like a 36D/36DD. So if you’re thinking of purchasing, size way up."
1.0,Sizing doesn’t match product measurements. It is XL was a medium
1.0,"What I like:  The pattern, the material, the lightness<br />What I dislike: Everything.  The packet where you place the filter is too big...so the filter slides all over, folds, slowly sliding out of the pocket.  When using the earhooks, and place the mask over your nose, the mask pretty much pokes you in the eyes...because the mask was cut STRAIGHT, not at an angle so it would avoid eye contact...or if you pull it down so it doesn't poke you in the eyes, your nose is no longer covered/OR the filter does not cover your nose...in other words, useless.<br /><br />Overall I had high hopes for this item, and pretty much tossed it in the garbage after trying to wear it for 3 hours at work.  I was constantly trying to cover my nose while not poking my eyes out...or fixing the filter pouch so the filter wasn't falling out...or re-hooking the ear-loops around my eyes."
1.0,This is made for a child not an adult size is very small
1.0,Tore after 2 times wearing. Returning
1.0,way too small.  said 3X  was a woman medium
1.0,Don’t bother. It doesn’t fit snuggly around your face. Waste of hard earned money.
1.0,Material is multi layered. The stitching is so wide and sticks out. Material is also shiny and not soft.
1.0,"Extremely tight and i got a size bigger I’m a small, I can shop in the kids section. But they were easy to work with as far as returns."
1.0,Very sad that these were not good lens. After 2 days of wear they began to flake off parts of coating or color on both lens.<br />Would not recommend even at this inexpensive price.
1.0,These are not exactly as described. They resemble the glasses from the movie but not very well.  I regret my purchase
1.0,"Terrible quality! The shirt was faded and stained, like someone had worn it and washed it in bleach. It was NOT a new item. Gross!"
1.0,The band is very pretty but turns your wrist green
1.0,Turned black and infected my ear after a couple weeks of wearing
1.0,I liked the look of this bracelet from its pics - the actual product was poorly made - the holes in some of the chips weren't placed properly so some of the chips were sticking out and in less than a week the bracelet burst - it was a very disappointing purchase from this seller - I always purchase stuff from this seller and have never encountered any problems before.
1.0,"Unacceptable quality. They were literally delivered on Saturday, today is Friday and they look like that. My daughter wore them twice, she is very careful with her clothes/shoes. These didn’t last a week!!!! I feel like I just dumped my hard earned money in the trash, she can’t wear them to school like that."
1.0,The material is not at all what I expected and I honestly just hated the fit and everything about it. I read how people loved it but it was a no for me.
1.0,"I bought this dress for my 22nd Birthday. When it arrived, it was absolutely beautiful. While attempting to zip the zipper it INSTANTLY BROKE! The zipper is extremely FRAGILE. How upsetting.... I will be returning this dress."
1.0,Loved the style.  It fell apart when I put it on my wrist
1.0,"This hat was way too small and it was made of poor materials. Also it was packaged poorly, it was stuffed into a box that was smaller than the actual hat.  To add insult to injury I returned the item no only to be charge the amount I paid for the hat. If I would have known that I would have just tried to gift to someone who would have appreciated the gesture."
1.0,I was super sad because I have a dollar left on my gift card and all this stuff says one cent but when you get to the checkout it's like 5 bucks so I couldn't get it😒
1.0,Did not meet expectations the item does not look like item in picture and the key pendant was missing the stone😡
1.0,"Horrible material, too small, too costly to return. I doubt if a child could fit the medium. Never purchase coats from unknown brand."
1.0,I had to give this away I would've loved for this dress to fit but I gave to my daughter when I hadn't returned it in time for credit.
1.0,Very poorly made. Ordered 2. One instantly broke out of the package and the other was not properly put together so it stayed tangled and didn't sit right. Sending back immediately.
1.0,The set looks very cheap.  When arrived the stone was loose and then fell out.  Tried contacting the seller with no luck.  Don’t waste your money
1.0,"It doesn’t look like the picture at all and it’s way to small , size doesn’t match up don’t buy this product!"
1.0,HORRIBLE Quality. Absolutely horrible. They completely fell apart within 3 days. The lens won't stay in. The gram is flexiable but won't retain its correct shape therefore not holding in the lens. Cheap junk. Buyer beware.
1.0,Disgusting and unsanitary. The item arrived with mold on it. I’m incredibly dissatisfied and disappointed. Please be careful if ordering from them. Items should not arrive in such conditions.
1.0,I chose one star because you have to put something to add a review. Highly unsatisfied! I did not receive what is in the picture. I waited almost a month and got poor quality mask. The hoop part that goes in the ear is nothing like in pictures it’s just a hoop that rips easily. Highly upset!!
1.0,Arrived too late for event.  Arrived with a large snag in the sleeve.  Attempted return but product ships to Great Britain and the cost of shipping to return it was 7 x the cost of the sweater.  So now I have a snagged sweater.  Waste of money.
1.0,These leave a mark on your nose and have absolutely no padding-- rough plastic and left a mark that lasted for hours!
1.0,"These are SO THIN that they bend in ways they shouldn't and won't stay on, even with the endless loop hooking system. One knock with the collar of my coat and I was picking one of them up out of the middle of the street I was walking across. Too much money for such a flimsy product. Good on the seller though that they refunded me my money without question."
1.0,"This case was great until it wasn't. After 3 months of careful use, it will no longer close and is useless."
1.0,"I wear a 44C and that's what I ordered.  What I got said 44C.  I couldn't get it over my head.  They charge 5.65 to return items, so make sure it is what you want.  I suppose they are good if they come anywhere near fitting.  Won't know about that because I will never buy them again. Think twice."
1.0,It runs very small.<br />The elbow patches were placed incorrectly on the inside of the sleeves.
1.0,This jacket was purchased as a gift. It was a gift in the end of January and now can not be returned. I’m highly disappointed with this jacket because the battery was charged and the jacket will not turn on. We tired to charge the battery two times and still nothing. I’m hoping there is something the company can do for me as I spent over $100 on something that doesn’t even work. I’m one pissed off customer about this.
1.0,"Ordered 2 pair, one leopard and one a neutral color. Was sent 2 neutrals. One fit too short,  one for too wide. Sent one back for a refund and the other for an exchange.  STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE EXCHANGE!! 3 MONTHS AGO"
1.0,"Great quality but size was not Large as ordered, more like medium."
1.0,"It looks like a potato sack on me! I’m 5’5 & 140lbs and ordered medium; as I mentioned it looked like it could fit two of me in it. Ordered another one - small size and it was still big; it was smaller on the top so now my boobs were a bit smushed, but still looked like a potato sack.<br />Edit: whatever the dress is laced with, it gave me some allergic skin reaction. Stay away from this."
1.0,They do not fit right. It’s like the nose is to big. And they are just not right.
1.0,Tent of a dress
1.0,"After one days wear to work, the earrings started to turn a redish-brown color and tarnish. Better off buying a pair from local beauty supply."
1.0,Material is very cheap. Fit as expected.
1.0,Reaks of chemicals. Not wearing this filthy thing.
1.0,Love the style. Battery lasted less than 2 months.
1.0,"This is an extremely poorly made product and fits nothing like the photo. I shouldn't have expected much for the price, but I will definitely never purchase anything from this vendor again. I imagine most of their products end up in a landfill after one use."
1.0,I thought these shoes were unisex as it said girls/boys shoes. I ordered the red ones for my son but returned them because they were red with gold glitter all over. The description did not say that it had glitter on them.
1.0,I bought it for my daughters birthday open the package very cheaply made material is very cheap I wouldn’t even wear it not happy
1.0,The arms aren’t long enough and it fit me kinda of boxy.
1.0,Returned ordered by mistake
1.0,These bracelets fell apart I sent them back
1.0,"I have to return. Definitly not a maternity shirt and looks nothing like the picture. Like the color and material, but like I said, not what I ordered."
1.0,The fabric is awful. Not something a person wants next to their skin. It would cost more to send it back than what I paid so it goes to good will.
1.0,I bought these as a gift. The sole had come loose from bottom of shoe. Had to return. Poor workmanship.
1.0,I was disappointed as the size didn't fit
1.0,Cheap and tarnished. The finish on these earrings wore off in three months by only wearing part time.
1.0,"I've had this watch for 4 months and love the look of it. Great size, very comfortable. However, the edge of the strap that connects to the watch-face is splitting. And the synthetic fibers underneath reveal that the mint-colored part is NOT genuine leather! I'm disappointed in the misleading information of the description. :("
1.0,"The white part fits fine, but the black part is huge in comparison so it’s loose and looks weird."
1.0,I ordered this belly button ring and wore it for a about one month before it broke.
1.0,"this was overall kinda of a loose fit. it’s super cute and loved the design. however, the material of the dress is well thin and see through!"
1.0,Its more like a toy.
1.0,No dura nada pierde el color
1.0,"I loved the color and the scallop design on the side of the bathing and the back, but other then that I didn’t really care for it. It bothered my neck, the cups were too low and made me looked completely flat chested!"
1.0,"'0'  STARS<br />IT'S NOT WORTH A DIME<br />The clasp, although a bit difficult to maneuver DOES NOT stay closed.<br />Heading to the return column"
1.0,Did not like the fabric at all. Couldn’t get the wrinkles out of I’d.
1.0,"Flimsy, this didn't last 6 months, a little tear turned into completely useless piece of once nice pajama bottoms"
1.0,Too large to get through my ears. I've never seen anything like it!
1.0,The orange color is different than on the picture
1.0,My daughter saved her money to buy this watch.  She researched and chose this one based on the fact it stated it was waterproof.  She went swimming with it and now it does not work.  The bottom of the watch says Water resistant.  This was very disappointing for her.  How do I get a replacement.  Please fix the description to reflect the product!
1.0,Cheap and the style isn’t what I thought I was getting….
1.0,Disliked. And by the time I gave it as a gift refund time expired. It slipped of child’s head due to hair. Not a good purchase
1.0,Very cheaply made plastic necklace. Stone fell out after only used once.
1.0,Super small don’t buy it
1.0,The quality is no where close to in the picture
1.0,Broken zipper. Fit was way off.
1.0,"Says one size but doesn't come close.  Some might say Full Size,<br />but in this pair of pants it really does feel like a pair, like the material<br />for two made up this one. Check the Size carefully before ordering,<br />and don't leave town before checking them once they arrive, like I<br />did.  Only gave them one star as the material is fairly light, thin<br />yet decent...just way too much of it., I am thinking goodwill."
1.0,"If your product is intended to do a specific task and fails that task, then 1 star is the only way to go. I've played around with the settings, tried all different movements. None of them work to wind my watch. I thought my watch was messed up so I paid to have the movement in the winder replaced. And that turned out not to be the issue. This product doesnt hold the watches at enough of an angle for movements to use gravity to displace. Really bummed. The mechanics behind it all and the product itself is good quality. Just the design and physics that were overlooked during testing. Now I'm out money for the winder, and movement replacement on my watch."
1.0,"Colour is grey and definitely not sky blue. I was unable to load my photo, unfortunately.  Something is wrong with the link."
1.0,Arrived very wrinkly and is see through so if you have a slip you wanted to wear under that might be fine. Very thin fabric.
1.0,Very poor quality. It looks really cheap in real. Had to return.
1.0,Wasn’t grey… actually a light purple
1.0,Very thin material. Not comfortable at all to wear. If your shoe size is a 12 socks fit like a 10. Runs small. Returning the order
1.0,"I wear a size 14 and this belt was wayyy too small.  I could not get the sides to meet.  It was about 6 inches too short.  The belt was BEAUTIFUL.  I loved it, but it was just too small."
1.0,"I ordered this luggage a few weeks ago to take on a trip.  I was happy with the look, size, and setup of it when I received it.  I packed it up and off I went.  When I arrived at my destination (straight shot flight) one of the wheels had broken off, and one of the top corners had been bashed in.  It was an absolute pain to trudge through the airport with the luggage with a broken wheel. We were doing a little traveling around while in the city I was in, and I had to either carry my luggage through the city because it was broken (and looked absolutely terrible).  WHAT A PAIN!  On my trip home another one of the wheels broke off and a third one cracked.  I had to carry my luggage through the airport once again while it was all bashed in and missing wheels.  SO EMBARRASSING!  I DO NOT recommend this luggage to anyone.  DON'T WASTE THE MONEY!  I would like a full refund for the luggage so I can buy something that is not going to come home from it's FIRST TRIP in PIECES!"
1.0,Minutes after I pulled this dress from the packaging the little golden stars started just flaking off..  after I tried to out this dress on my floor was literally littered with them. Not to mention the dress didn’t even look like the picture. I returned this. Very disappointed
1.0,"We ordered a Large and compared it to about 20 other large sized sweaters in my husbands closet and it was more like a small-extra small, beware!"
1.0,This was huge mistake. The engraving is unreadable. Very disappointed. Ha to order this bracelet as one I ordered from another company became unreadable after a few months wear.  First responders must be able to read the info on this bracelet. My life depends on that.  I'll try a third company and see if I have better luck.
1.0,Retuned is too small for me
1.0,Jeans arrived but do not look the same as advertised also they run really small I am 5’6 190 pounds and ordered a 2XL And they were super snug so I will be returning these
1.0,Bag broke after one week of use on vacation. I am waiting for the seller to refund me or send a replacement.
1.0,Don't stay clasped
1.0,Looks like a dress from “The handmaid’s tale” but in purple. Not cute.
1.0,They are garbage. The 5 masks together will not offer any safety. I wish I can send them back without having to go to the post office or the UPS. Do not whatsoever by this garbage.
1.0,This robe runs very small. I was unable to return or exchange because I waited 1 day too long and window was closed. I star is too generous.
1.0,These where supposed to be a size 3 and my daughter who is typically a size 0 couldn't even button these however my six year old who is a 6/6x in KIDS fit her perfect.
1.0,Waist band is thick and hard. Size is all wrong. Ordered a medium and it's more like a xx-small or kids size. Very disappointed
1.0,Too small for my 10 month old grandaughter and the fabric does not strecht
1.0,Had to be reordered twice and still came in broke in half and missing pieces.
1.0,This didn’t look anything like the product photo. The material is like polyester and heavy and gross. It is incredibly small. Ordered a 2x and it’s more like a size small.
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE!!<br />I should have known that for $1.80 that this would have not been worth it! The picture of the setting is completely wrong, the band is very cloudy and feels like it has patina already, and nowhere on here does it tell you the grade of metal! This ring is absolutely not worth the $2, trust me!"
1.0,Arrived tarnished and had to return.
1.0,Purchased these for my 13 year old they were too big for his ear. Size was huge nice earrings but size too large.
1.0,Does not look like the pic. The patch sits funny on the lid. Looks cheap and not designed to be on a hat.<br />Patch is kinda cool for a bag not a hat.<br />Pain in the butt to return.
1.0,What a disappointment!  I believe I have worn this belt a maximum of 4 times.  It just completely split.
1.0,Looks beautiful but runs extremely small I wear a large they sent me 2X and I still couldn’t button these shorts up. Waste of my money
1.0,Very poor quality. Sewing all came undone; loose strings everywhere; hem fell out upon first wearing
1.0,Not all that.....the material felt very cheap an the pants are see through in the sun light. This outfit is not for women with thick curves
1.0,"Ordered this coat and a gift. It is super cute and looks just like the picture, but it is extremely too big. I ordered a 2T and we received an XL. My seven year old sister could fit the jacket. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,"If you have a long torso, it won’t look right - at least not for me. It’s a beautiful dress though. Very tight in chest area for larger women."
1.0,"Save your time and money. Quality is very poor, it's thin no warmth to it, I bought a xll and it fit like a medium, this is not sold by amazon so you have to wait forever for a refund from the seller. I'm tired of amazon selling cheap china goods at a high price, time to go back to store shopping."
1.0,Balls not threaded correctly long one within 24 hours put it back on and lost it again
1.0,Last time I order same product it's great and that time they send me on  box but this time they send me with out box raping with plastic so 3 bangle broke
1.0,BELIEVE what is written: Sizing too small.  XL = Medium or skinny Lg.  Returning.  Quality of construction is so so.  Did not wash so can't speak to the issue of longevity.  This review would be for the brand besides the items I bought.
1.0,Runs very small. I wear a 12 and the XXL didn't fit.
1.0,Done but This. Brim is crooked.  Stitching quality is very bad.  Overall major disappointment
1.0,"Got the item days in advance, all six colors but none of them are glowing. 😔"
1.0,The white shirt came with black sleeve stains on it. Looked as if some one had folded the sleeves on the white shirt and the color bleed on to the white.  There was a stain on the front and one on the back.  With the shirt being white it was very visible
1.0,Cute but not functional. The earrings don’t hang well and face towards the back of your head showing the wrong side.
1.0,Product arrived with a damaged button
1.0,It was advertised as being 100% cotton and it’s not...a total mystery fabric blend gave it to Goodwill
1.0,"I bought these in white and while they were very comfortable, the material is so thin the pants were completely see through."
1.0,"Was so disappointed in these jeans , the yellowish stitching made them look real cheap , the ones I got in sams club was so much better and the material was better then these . Won’t buy these on line anymore. RETURNING  and NOW THEY TELL ME I HAVE TO PAY A RETURN FEE NEVER WILL BY FROM THEM AGAIN  ."
1.0,"Smelled of perfume, like they had already been worn.  Nasty.  Size looked extremely small vs. the true size.  Seller agreed to accept return, which makes it easy to work with them."
1.0,This didn’t look great in person - very prominent silver metal chains holding the spoils together and the spools were unspooling thread. Not worth it at all.
1.0,Ruined my gshock trying to install these. Trying to wiggle the pin in and out of the hole in order to get a fit bored the whole out. Have a jeweler install them.
1.0,I had to return this item . Cheap material and runs little small
1.0,"Ordered the lot of 4, thinking they would be 35mm in length. Arrived today, the same length (38mm) as the last one I ordered. Not too happy about this. A couple more wasted industrial barbells! The price would be great if you were getting what you needed!"
1.0,"Too big. And they way they fit, they look like grandma pants."
1.0,"these leggings ripped within hours of wearing them.  Right at the crotch too...not something I would order again.  On the positive side, they are super soft, but that does me no good if they rip..."
1.0,There is no way this is a x-large
1.0,"I received it very wrinkled, very poor quality, nothing to do with the photo."
1.0,I dislike that it was marked as an XL but looked like a kids shirt when I got it
1.0,Even with those little ear Stoppers these will slide -fall out ans so light you may not even notice.  The next time I think I'll buy the ones that are bent metal that go through the ear lobe
1.0,"When this arrived, I genuinely thought I’d been sent the wrong item, but the item numbers matched. On my color corrected monitor, the tunic appears to be in lovely muted shades of teal and rust. What arrived was a garish bright turquoise, with equally bright coral and pink. The fabric isn’t soft at all, and in fact was itchy even just trying it on. Though the fit was correct and had plenty of room, the buttons gapped no matter how I shifted it. The large medallion on the front was dead center and in those bright colors looked like a bullseye.  It’s rare I have to send clothes back to Amazon, but this one got it wrong all the way around."
1.0,I expected theseHuggie Earrings to be much smaller in size ......The earring itself is quite pretty but much to big for me ........Definitely not what I expected after viewing picture ...
1.0,These fell apart after my first wear and wash. Total waste of money!
1.0,"Poor materials,  and does not give the oomph it says."
1.0,According to the Amazon site sizing guide I bought a size larger than I should have. In order for me to wear a hoodie under the jacket.  I could not even come close to zipping it up. The 2XL is close to probably a size 12 if you do not have a chest. I think that this is more youth size than women size.
1.0,The sizing is not even remotely accurate. Couldn’t even get over my thighs. Disappointed
1.0,Very very low quality and disappointing
1.0,Cheap looking!! The thread coming out the seams. It’s not sewn properly!!! Horribly made!!
1.0,"These gloves do not keep your hands warm, waste of money do not buyThese are the worst pairs of gloves I ever had."
1.0,quality of material was very poor and scratchy.  i'm pretty sure it's not the same dress as the one in the picture.  this one has no structure through the bodice.
1.0,La costura de la camisa viene algo suelta
1.0,The sizing is off on these. I'm 5'2 and they were rather short. I finally cut them down to shorts.
1.0,Nice but really cheap
1.0,Cute boho beach bag we went on 2 beach trips in April by the 2nd trip the bag ripped where the strap meets the bag not worth your $$$
1.0,"Trash, it worked for about four times, then it split open at the bottom, rain got in and wet my sneakers, had to work all day with wet feet."
1.0,"Junk, looks nothing like picture. Item was received after window for return eligibility. Don’t not purchase."
1.0,Strap broke on plane
1.0,will try to get tailored to fit well.
1.0,I bought this for my 6-yr-old and picked the “appropriate” size for her based on the sizing chart. The dress I received was so small it wouldn’t even fit a toddler.
1.0,Why would y’all have a white woman modeling to sale a shirt with black woman as face🙄 y’all stay doing to much.
1.0,It’s awkward it’s definitely awkward it fits like pajamas like it’s see through alittle light weight but tight in the waist band yet baggy I don’t like it but I kept the set to look cute for bed time I suppose lolol I got the white n grey set I kinda wish I would have sent it back but whatever I would highly recommend sizing up if u have a mommy tummy or are like bigger in the tummy or arms I’m normally a size M but this was xL and was small on me
1.0,The bottoms don’t have functional holes. Way over sized. Smells like moth balls
1.0,Not what I expected. No refund policy. Terrible experience. Don’t get taken in by picture and description.
1.0,"Too expensive for the type of material, had a strange odor, washed them a few times to get rid of and ripped off on neck area the next day I wore it."
1.0,The product must run larger than normal.
1.0,"This product that was delivered to me twice was not a boys 10/12 but rather a Women's 10/12. It has small stitching, small, short sleeves, and has slits on the side with a tailored cut to the body of the shirt. Definitely not a boys shirt."
1.0,"Fit small, need larger sizes."
1.0,Ordered a size up and still very tight!
1.0,"pretty, but fell off three times!  returning the necklace before i lose it or a stone comes out after hitting the floor"
1.0,This was poorly made and the fabric once washed is shredding on the inside.  refund would be nice.....tossing them out
1.0,I purchased the other color forest and out fit great.  This one is very short yup front.  Then I realized that out was a different manufacturer.  They just look the same but they really sees not.
1.0,The tail wasn’t included.
1.0,They were the wrong size.
1.0,"I'm relatively  a small person, 5 foot 137 lb I like my clothes big... so I ordered an extra large and the SOB fit like a tight medium... super disappointed material is nice the color is nice I just don't feel the sizing is accurate."
1.0,"these are ridiculous...the hoop is so small, it's impossible to even get it through your ear and clasp it-they must be made for babies! And the measurement they provide is in metric; who can calculate that just off the top of their head? Not me! I'm sending them back, and I'm VERY disappointed. Don't buy these unless they're for an infant. Total waste of effort and money!"
1.0,It looks cheap because it’s printed on the fake leather it’s not stitched on it. The print quality on it to looks bad as well. It’s really hard to so when you go to put it on it looks like it’s cracking when you wrap it around your wrist.
1.0,"These pants looks nothing like the picture advertised. I am unsure as to the other reviews that I see, however it is nothing like the picture advertised. I would not buy again."
1.0,"Unhappy with quality.  Looks very cheap on.  Strung on very inflexible wire, so it does not hang loose.  Be sure you really want this item as the seller will NOT accept returns."
1.0,"Yes, I have a big foot...  I wear an 11...  My daughter who wears an 8 can wear these...  Sizing is WAY off...  very disappointed."
1.0,The image is highly misleading.  The bottom of the shirt is straight cut and for people with extremely short torsos.  I ordered the same size as all my dress shirts and it barely covered my belt buckle.
1.0,Broken arrived in pieces very flimsy necklace and it was sooo short even a doll couldn’t wear this!
1.0,Mint green not lime green
1.0,Llego muy tarde. Pero a mi hijo le gusto
1.0,"Way too big, but nice heavy material for fall/winter dress,"
1.0,Bought these for 12 year old nephew. They don’t seem to go above the ankle. Advertising makes it look like they go up the calf.
1.0,"I really loved the look of this watch band. Clean and classy. I received an updated Apple Watch for Christmas and installed this band around New Year’s. With two weeks of wear, the white links are quite discolored. I only wear the watch to work and have it off once I return home. I don’t use makeup or sprays for it to discolor this way. I’m really unhappy with this one. I had a wearlizer band for my series 2, and was totally happy with it. I probably had the band for close to 2 years with the other one. This one, two weeks?! Epic fail. Maybe choosing another color/finish might work, but now I’m weary of this product altogether."
1.0,"I could use it only once. I tried to sew it, but the dress broke again."
1.0,"I received this item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest review. I received these leggings with a big hole in the leg. I contacted the seller and received a refund. Besides the hole, I tried them on and they we a little too small. They are also VERY see-through. Leggings should never be worn as pants, but even with a long tunic, I still wouldn't be comfortable wearing something so see-through. I was highly disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,Seriously...there is no motor in the watch and the knife is full.
1.0,"This is a very thin, lightweight item.  It is also not true to size.  I would return it but I donated it already.  Poor quality."
1.0,What was provided was not same as pictured
1.0,My baby is 6 months and they are still way to big
1.0,They don't stay in. They fall out all the time. Super annoying.
1.0,Hot glued together. Pieces fell off when I got them.
1.0,"Meh. Very very thin and kind of short.<br />UPDATE: Washed it and brought it on my trip to Las Vegas. First time to wear it and it tore in two places at the seams. When I pulled down on the sides to adjust it. So, never got to wear it.  (not counting when I briefly tried it on when it arrived)  So very annoyed."
1.0,Very cute but it ripped as soon as my daughter put it in and it's not right. Won't ever but again!!! Very disappointed and aggravated.
1.0,Fit is waaaayyy small - I gave it to my 10 yr old
1.0,The picture made it look like it was longer; at least to my hips.  This shirt barely came to my waist.  VERY disappointed.
1.0,Arrived bent to the point you could not wear them. Returned.
1.0,They are way to big for a woman
1.0,"These earrings are TINY. When I opened up the box I had to laugh, I ended up giving them to my 7 year old niece because there was no way they were going to fit my ears. Perhaps it was my error in not noticing the size description (if there was one), in addition to the laughable size, the clasps are nearly impossible to open/close"
1.0,These earrings are not the size of a quarter. yet smaller than a dime. They bend easily and do not stay closed. They are small enough for toddlers not adults.<br />I just threw this crap away
1.0,Material thin and cheap
1.0,"It was frumpy and looked like a lab coat. Even had I got a smaller size.. it would make a good mad scientist Halloween costume but as for something to wear all the time, not a chance."
1.0,These are so adorable & my daughter loved them but then only a few weeks later they looked like they were unraveling everywhere. The insides of the show have completely broken down. It's aweful.
1.0,Strong mildew/mold odor.  Could not even handle it without sneezing and allergies going haywire.  Exchanged it for a new one with the same exact results.
1.0,Not worth it<br /> Never worked
1.0,"The fit was bad, and the zipper was sown incorrectly so that it stabbed you every time you moved your arm."
1.0,I can't. even wear this dress.right side have a hitch there.lts factory fault<br />I want my money back
1.0,"All 10 noses came squished into a box that was maybe 1” x 2” x 3” if that. When I took them out of the box, they were all squished together and flattened out. I thought if they were unpacked a few days that they would re-expand and take their original shape, but they have not. They have expanded a little, but they’re still completely misshapen."
1.0,I ordered a xl and received a small.
1.0,The top is like a crop top; runs very small and shorts are short short.
1.0,Does NOT keep accurate time !😧😬😪
1.0,"Delivery was super fast, that's a plus, however, the dress is very cheaply made.  The material is far too light weight.  I would not recommend purchasing this particular dress.  That being said, last year I did purchase another dress from this company and was very pleased with it.  I hope this review helps."
1.0,Doesn't look like this and cheap!
1.0,I have purchased a lot from Amazon but this product was worst and i can't even wear this earring.
1.0,"I ordered khaki, their version of khaki looked light rosey pink. Cheap material. Order at least 2 sizes larger. Just awful!"
1.0,"I did give this bag 4 stars initially but I have revised that to just 1 star. Initially I said &#34;Love this bag, I would give it a 5 but the zipper on the inside pocket  keeps coming apart.&#34;  Now I all four handles have broken and the decorative pieces have fallen off.  This is not the only handbag that I use and I do not overfill it or abuse it.  There is no reason that it should be in this shape at this point.  I have many handbags, some are up to 5 years old and they are not falling apart.  I would not recommend this bag to anyone."
1.0,It fell apart and literally got tied in my hair
1.0,I just got ripped off. I ordered size Medium and they extremely small. I think a 4 year old would fit them. I am only 5feet and normally wear small or medium. I understand they are compression shorts but there is no way an adult can fit this. Wish I can return it. Ughh! So mad. What am I supposed to do with them.
1.0,Very thin and doesn’t stay up
1.0,Ridiculously oversized!!! HUGE earrings. I mean- they go past your shoulder. Not at all what I expected. Tried to return.
1.0,My daughter was given a headband for her birthday. She wore it once (very cute) and it immediately started falling apart.
1.0,Way better on the model and it didn't me that's for sure
1.0,These are very cheap looking and super thin<br /> They look like something I would get at dollar store.
1.0,"This product states they fit women with a C cup. Although they did cover my nipples, they did not provide the lift. When I did position them to create lift, the adhesive was not strong enough and kept falling off."
1.0,Kept falling or of my nose! Hate it
1.0,Hated the dress.  The color on the top of the dress was nothing like the bottom.  One was more purple while the bottom was more royal blue.
1.0,I wear a large in all shirts but they are a little large on me. This shirt I looked forward to wearing during the holidays was so disappointingly small. Returned.
1.0,"Terrible material, super small. It needed up being a bathing suit cover up. Don’t waste your money"
1.0,The ring looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Super poor quality  horrible do not waste your money on this .
1.0,The stones fell out the 1st time I wore it! Waste of money
1.0,"Well, in my opinion, this was falsely advertised.<br />If you read the description above it clearly states the following:<br />""Adjustable drawstring, built in bra, solid color and many pattern, camisole tank top"".<br />It is none of those things except a solid color.  These were to wear around the house, alone, without a bra.  I didn't need a built in bra just a tank that gave little support.  If this were tight, no problem.  These are not see through so it would be perfect.  But I'm saying no support whatsoever.  If the descriprion is for another item, why is it listed under these? I can wear them to bed but that's not why I ordered these.  I'm debating sending them back only because it's a hassle for returns where I live.  But wanted to be clear of what  they are not.  I do not recommend  for anyone who wants a tank similar to my needs."
1.0,After 3 weeks turn my neck soooooo green
1.0,Very uncomfortable v horrible fit
1.0,Very thin gauze like material.
1.0,"Very didsapointed! First time I wore it, three of the stones fell out."
1.0,The no bs warranty isn’t bad but the 5 dollar charge for another poor quality watch band starts to get annoying. It feels sturdy and like a good band but it lacks durability. This is my 4th band that cracks like this they said they changed the material but it didn’t fix anything. The bands don’t last a year sometimes only 6 months try and buy something else made to a better standard.
1.0,just opened it and it came missing a spike- had to return immediately
1.0,The sleeves were not the same length and it was overall too short. This company did give me a refund tho.
1.0,Bought 0-3 months.. but compares to a size 18m
1.0,"It’s a bad quality fabric and it has a stitch, I’m very disappointed. I recommend you look for another brand."
1.0,I gave this gift to my sister-in-law and she just came to ask me what she can do because the ring turned completely black.
1.0,"Quality is horrible , it’s a scam ! Do not buy it"
1.0,I just received my order in the color black & I HATED IT....it looked nothing like the picture.
1.0,"I bought my bag on January 24 and it has now ripped at the seam, Im so disappointed because I was looking for something with military strength!!! Will not order futon here again"
1.0,received​ item all tangled up ;/
1.0,The ball at the end of the plastic hook was too big and so couldn’t work with the glasses.
1.0,broke after two days
1.0,THIS product does not protect against dust much less against a virus of any type. DO NOT USE FOR PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19 and do not trust a company that would allow reviews saying it can be used for this purpose. It is light and air because the knit is so big that small bugs can get through. This product is cheaply made and should only be used for fashion if even that since it in no way is made well and the extra finishing is not even trimmed.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough that this should NOT be used for protection against COVID19.. and this listing should not be allowed by Amazon.
1.0,Just purchased to wear inside as pajamas take the dog to potty and all the stitching has kind of tore or came out throughout the body fabric doesn't hold up well other than that it would have been nice
1.0,Just junk
1.0,I could see the piece that slips over you glasses when wearing and it was really bothersome.  They are really a VERY pretty color.  Returned to seller for a no hassle return.
1.0,The worse costume ever!!  They need to have zero stars ! I would not recommend
1.0,Fabric not nice
1.0,My 4 yr old son put these on and walked around for maybe 2 minutes. Literally both shoes ripped!  So cheaply made.
1.0,"So tired of liars.<br />Leopard print dress although is cute its polyester!!! Only confirmed my suspicion after getting it wet  while washing it.<br />This is not a viscose dress, it says it is 95% viscose but it is polyester!!!!<br /><br />Also purchased red polka dot dress- it is viscose. These dresses are made by different manufacturers as tags vary."
1.0,I bought this item in gray from the store and wanted the same but in white with black letters so I ordered it from Amazon. After washing once the letters lost the shiny topcoat and are patchy. Not the quality I would expect for a sports bra from a name brand at this price.
1.0,I can only wear these around the house. They fall down when I run and are see through when I squat.
1.0,"There are only six pairs, not eight. Not worth the struggle of returning, but buyer beware."
1.0,Couldn’t get passed my ankles. Definitely not great sizing guide...
1.0,Cheap looking wood grain and color is way off. Should have realizes the price and what do I expect. Would not buy again
1.0,Item arrived with the side of the jewelry bag wide open. It’s missing an earring and the necklace has a loose stone.
1.0,"Just as the previous reviewer, I also only received one sword instead of the six mentioned in the detailed description. I feel jiped, robbed, misleaded. Too expensive to not receive all the items and incomplete goodie bags I had planned out."
1.0,also the debit card i used to purchase this item was a prepaid debit card which i canot reload it so i trashed it after there was no funds on the card.
1.0,"Wore these pants for a special night out planned for months and they came apart at the seams both between the legs in the thigh area and the backside!! I had to leave and rush home to change! Talk about ANGRY!  And mind you, I am only a size 4 and had ordered the medium."
1.0,I can go to Rainbow and get it for $5. Definitely not worth $17!
1.0,Nothing like in the image.
1.0,You get what you pay for but I wasn’t expecting these to be way below sub standard quality
1.0,Cute skirt but it was a size 7 juniors. Was NOT what I ordered.
1.0,"Sorry, but I was not very impressed, very inexpensive look and feel."
1.0,Belt will last less than 6 months before it starts to fall apart. The belt looks good and has a good weight but it will not last. See the photos. This is not real leather.
1.0,Idea is cute. VERY rough material and runs about 2-3 sizes too SMALL! Will be returning.
1.0,"do NOT buy this<br />I loved the idea, but the medical alert symbols  fell off about the time the return period closed. I emailed the seller, but hear nothing back from them; probably because they knew I couldn't do anything about it."
1.0,This materiel was quite shear.  The Black also attracts anything and everything. Hard to clean.  Wrinkles easily.  Fit is good but it is too shear for me.  I thought they were overalls
1.0,wrong size - had to give it away
1.0,"These leggings are so small that they don't even go 1/3 the way up my thighs. I'm not a big person, either. I'm entirely convinced that this seller is a scam artist, who sends you tiny leggings, hoping that you'll say &#34;Oh well, maybe my eight-year-old niece can have them.&#34;<br />I contacted this seller, hoping they would let me know if this was a mistake or not. They refuse to say.<br />The seller just said &#34;If you keep them we'll give you three bucks. If not, return them. They won't tell me if my pair are a mistake or not.<br />Companies know that no one wants to go through the hassle of returning stuff. I'm convinced that this company is using that to their advantage. Taking three dollars off of the cost of these leggings is laughable, since they don't even fit my 13 year old little sister. Who is going to wear these, and why would it make me happy that I got three dollars off of them, when I can't even find someone to wear them? My other option is to take time out of my life (I use Amazon to save time...) to return these.<br /><br />Anyhow, they /are/ very soft and cute. I really wish they were as advertised. If you, or someone you know has tiny, skinny thighs, these are super soft, beautiful, and really nice-looking. If you are in any way, shape, or form, not an extremely small person, do not purchase."
1.0,nunca llego nada....pesimooo
1.0,Its not thick and kind of see through..sizes run very small
1.0,"I saw this and fell in love with the style/colors (and the price of course!!). I am a 38D, size 9 pant. I bought a large.<br /><br />The cup size was WAY too small (also too close together on the cups) and the waist was too big."
1.0,"Returning this tank. It’s a scratchy, uncomfortable material and very unflattering. Disappointed for I was very excited to receive it."
1.0,These pants were poorly made and are more flare than shown in the picture
1.0,It is not made for women who have curves at all. Very disappointed and I can't return it. It does look as shown in the pictures.
1.0,This dress is ugly. It has bizarre little triangle pieces of fabric coming down from the bodice. It’s too wide and it’s too short. I have no idea what kid this would fit or flatter.
1.0,Very light weight. Feels cheap like it will turn your neck green
1.0,Sizes run way too small
1.0,El pedido o sea el reloj no ha sido recibido. Deseo un reembolso
1.0,The joey was not included in the shipment.  The ad does not say not included.  I needed it last minute for a party so I am now with half a costume.  It had an awful urine like smell out of the package too.
1.0,"Do NOT but this! They say it is sterling silver, but it is definitely not! I tried to clean it with sterling jewelry cleaner and it turned orange! Terrible!"
1.0,Don't buy these.  Just go grab some little hoopy things from your dad/boyfriend/husband's toolbox.
1.0,I only received one of the butt pads
1.0,"Too thin. I did the candle test, my child could blow out a candle. It also, took too long to receive this item."
1.0,Fit funny on me. Shoulders were too puffy.
1.0,I ordered 2 sets only received 1
1.0,Size is way too big
1.0,World not turn on retired after calling customer service.
1.0,"I brought one to make sure it was what I needed, and it's great. Then 5 more as presents, and they come with cheap Plastic bands, Nothing like the first. Why does it say Stainless steel?"
1.0,"Product was very flimsy for price and only received top and whistle, no shorts, so now I only have half a costume for my own birthday party."
1.0,"These are terrible.  They break while trying to put them on!  If you do decide to order them,  I would get one or two sizes larger to lower the chances of breaking.  They do rip very easily too so I wouldn't bother.  I was too cheap and ignored the other reviews...my bad."
1.0,It is a very pretty ring but it is not real silver. Turned my finger green and the bottom of it is not silver any more
1.0,The print was subpar and the sizing is wrong. I purchased a 2xl and it fit like a medium.
1.0,"Worst belt I’ve ever seen or heard of. The ratchet did not work and I had to cut it off my favorite jeans. I thought it was worth a shot on a thirteen bucks flash sale.Wrong. The buckle is way heavy, and I say again, did not work. Shame on Amazon!"
1.0,The dress is not what I was expecting!! It is not ugly but the picture and the size is not accurate!! The tone of the yellow was too strong.. I used the chart side and purchased  the dress accordingly!! I also send the seller the actual sizes and hight.. The dress was too short  at front to use the underskirt and to big on the waist.. I paid extra for shipping to get it fast.. and I also have to pay to return it because it was not included. Not happy… I was left with - $50 (shipping cost) on my pocket and no dress.
1.0,Don’t waste your money! This is a belly shirt. It stopped just below my boobs. Not at all as described!
1.0,2 of the 3 ripped within 1 week of receiving them. Poorly made
1.0,"I got the dusty pink one, but it definitely came a bright coral pink. Really sad about it."
1.0,I was excited to order these but they are not as pictured and they were damaged upon arrival.
1.0,"This item is terrible quality - fabric, construction, workmanship, design/cut.  It is  NOT at all what is depicted on Amazon in the photograph or description.  Do not buy."
1.0,Don’t waste your money! This is just more poor quality Chinese junk! The lens fell out as soon as I put them on and the individual I focus adjusters were sticking so bad that one of them broke as soon as I tried to adjust it. Pure low-quality junk. 100% dissatisfied!
1.0,"I had to return the shoes. They malfunctioned almost from day one. By day five they just lit up whatever color they wanted, and stopped flashing. The tongue of one shoe kept sliding, with no way to secure it with the lace. Also, the on and off button is in an odd location. It is at the side of the joint area (lower ankle).  The button also slid into the fabric hole and had to be wiggled out."
1.0,Neck is tooooooo small... I don't have a melon head an I couldn't pull it over !!!!!
1.0,I wear a 3x in everything I have. These wouldn’t even go passed my knees. Returned.
1.0,Disappointed. Extremely cheap and flimsy product. It arrived with pieces broken off and lines tangled up. Definitely not worth buying. Returned it immediately.
1.0,"I wore them for the first time to the airport. Granted, I walked a lot. And yes, maybe my thunder thighs rub, but by the time I got to my destination, I had huge holes in the pants where my thighs must rub. Never seen anything like it."
1.0,It did not fit at all. It was too small! I'm a size small....I should have gotten an extra large....so imagine!
1.0,"I thought this item was a knit, but it turns out that it was material, so I was disappointed.  And it took forever to receive!"
1.0,This did not hold up my boobs. It was sticky as many have said but it did not lift or push them up as claimed; yes i read the directions. Oh well.
1.0,"They had a hole within two days of wearing them, not impressed...."
1.0,Do not fit well
1.0,"I received these the beginning of March and yesterday, May1, the second one broke. The first one I thought it was my fault, but when the second one broke with just normal motion. I did not wear them every day."
1.0,They do not look good on a man
1.0,"Horrible Material! It feels like a cheap lab coat that was transformed into a suit. Actually, my labcoat from my chemistry class had a better material. And let's not talk about the fit and construction."
1.0,"I bought up a size and it was still way too small and not stretchy at all!  I would not recommend, but if you buy, go up at least 2 sizes!"
1.0,This dress was nothing like it is pictured. It fit semi loose and it's just not what I expected.
1.0,"This is item was terrible.  The quality was cheaply made, the seams were coming out of it.  The size was also too small from the normal size."
1.0,"Beautiful top and made well.  BUT runs very, very small."
1.0,Fabric is so cheap..you can see through it all..i put my hand under the top and I literally can tell fabric is so thin!! I didn’t even bother to open rest of it at all as I can tell from weight of the packet it’s cheap and one time use only.  I’m not paying $40 for this fabric if I can get same for half of the price.
1.0,Save yourself the trouble and pass by this.  The fabric was cheap with little to no stretch.  Pretty sure this is knock off.
1.0,"I wanted to like these but I really, really don't.  Poor quality, too small.  Skip 'em."
1.0,"Too small, very thin fabric, disappointing at best."
1.0,Awful!!! Too big. No directions on how to size it and it’s not rose gold. Just hold.
1.0,"Wife: Product came looking fine, I was excited to try them. Then I looked at everything and saw that I had mostly matching pieces from the 2,3, and 4 hook colors. Only a few didn't have a full set of the same color. I thought, oh well, as long as they work and are close. Then I wore them for 1 day and found that they scratched me up because the fabric is so sharp on all of the edges. I don't know who could wear these..."
1.0,poorly made and not a good fit
1.0,"I ordered these for my sister and she was pleased with the fit, appearance and feel of these PJ's. She wanted a loose fit and was pleased that these pajamas ran big. This is what I based my first review upon. But after wearing them and washing them a couple of times the material started ripping. The material is poor quality and they are cheaply made. I would not waste my money on this product."
1.0,"Poorly made, very undersized. Will never wear it."
1.0,"Loved the ring at first, but the black rubbed off very quickly. Bought in January and did not wear until July. After wearing it for less then six months the black is noticeably faded and blotchy with no way to fix it. Would not recommend."
1.0,I liked the design and product but I got it on Halloween night and it didn’t come with a thing the blows the air into it and we had to buy another flamingo one witch was way worse
1.0,To long to get split down the side of the bottom hat holder
1.0,it does not fit any adult
1.0,"I ordered this dress as a fun -to the beach, to happy hour dress.<br />Sadly, the material is nothing like the picture.. Think a heavy shower curtain.<br />The sizing seems to be OK.  I am 5'8 1/2"" 155, and ordered a large but it did not hang nice.  It looked more like a circus tent.  VERY wide.  Could have used the medium. (if I liked it at all).<br /><br />The print is adorable.  Would love if they tried again with a rayon/cotton blend that lied flat and flowed.<br />Don't waste your money.  Oh and the shipping took forever."
1.0,Waited weeks to get this and what a let down! Material was cheap looking
1.0,"I should have known better than to order something with very few reviews, but these shorts appeared to be what I was looking for so I took a chance. I ordered size 20-22 and I am usually a size 18W or a 20. These were way too small. Couldn't get them all the way up over my hips.  Returning."
1.0,"VERY very thin. More like a handkerchief, not a bandana."
1.0,"I needed these glasses to put my makeup on  and they were the perfect solution for me! I loved them them for 2 weeks. THEN, the right lens did not stay up.  Both len's are down at the same time and I cannot see a thing. I wasted my money. The vendor wanted a picture of problem? What do I send, anyone can send 2 len's down. I would not recommend."
1.0,I think one of them are just a paper clip!
1.0,These things run like 4 sizes too big.
1.0,color charges from  silver to red
1.0,not Disney originals
1.0,Love the orange but they split after a couple times worn
1.0,"This dress is put together all wrong.  I think a grade school home economics student could put together a better dress. I see the reviews that say it didn't fit, but frankly even if it fit (as mine does), it would be strange, awkward and unflattering."
1.0,The colors are more faded than in the pictures.
1.0,Pearl clasp broke off after only a few days of wearing.
1.0,With in seconds of putting on knew right away that they were going to cause blisters between the toes.  The hard plastic was very uncomfortable and are in no way a good product.
1.0,"I sort of knew this was going to be a bit of a joke when I bought them. No illusions. I wanted to wear them with the stupid one piece blanket i had bought before. Worth  a pic on facebook. But these are SOOOOOO bad, I couldn't even justify the few dollars. Should be sold through TOYSRUS as a toy for tots. If you live in a highrise, open your balcony door, take the money out of your wallet and let the wind carry it away. Way more fun and value than zoomies."
1.0,I opened the package to find a large hole in the netting.
1.0,"I ordered this 1 size up for a baggy fall fit, and it was unbelievably form fitting."
1.0,I don't understand the good reviews. I got the black Capri leggings. The material is cheap and they are COMPLETELY see through! Don't waste your time.
1.0,My son wore these once and they have not lighted up since !!!!Also contacted the company and they just told me to charge them again after i said i already had ...Would not recommend anyone buying these for their children as they are disappointed after they wear them and than dont light up again!!!
1.0,Quality was not there for me. And the hook doesn’t work properly
1.0,These did not stick and they were dragging my breasts down instead up.  I didn't even wear them for 30 minutes and they were already sliding off.  I had to return them.
1.0,like a toy..
1.0,Very hot and run small. Shrink significantly when washed and dried
1.0,I think these were the ones that i could not open at all.  I even tried needle nose pliers.  But - it could have been a bad batch and i ordered two other sizes as well from the same company - this may not be the size that did not work.
1.0,Doesn't quite wear the way the it's shown in the picture.
1.0,They looked nice online but very cheap in person. I was excited when I ordered them and couldn't wait to get them because I have been looking at them for a long time. They certainly are not worth $190 bucks. They resemble something that one would purchase at a &#34;Payless&#34; shoe discount shop. Very poor and cheap craftsmanship. It looks like I'm back to the drawing board surfing the magnificent Amazon.
1.0,"Feel apart after 3 months. Barely worn, like new"
1.0,looks very strange somehow on the wrist.
1.0,It didn’t come with any tag. It’s solid pink. No greenish gray.
1.0,This is made of cheap material. It clings everywhere. It came down to my knees and the batwing sleeves were just awkward. Not at all what I was expecting. 0/10 would not recommend.
1.0,Not worth the money at all!! It states in the info section that it is fade resistant. After 6 months it looks horrible!! I contacted the company LeeMas and they will not replace or refund. DO NOT waste your money on this product.
1.0,Did not fit well ☹️
1.0,"Bogus!  Turned out to be made of plastic, and the weakest &#34;magnets&#34; ever seen"
1.0,Absolutely did not like these at all half of them didn't even fit
1.0,The suit is not double lined. The bust is very awkward. No matter how tight I tied both straps I could not get it fit the right way. It did have good booty coverage though!
1.0,"This shirt looks cool in the photo, but it looks and feels terrible in person. Fabric is very rough. It fits too short."
1.0,Not as advertised when coming to the size and length of these pants. You have to be a size 1- 3 and super short for this to fit you baggy or ankle length as seen in the picture. I am so disappointed.......talk about false advertising!!!!!!
1.0,The measurement chart is not ok
1.0,"Ordered on May 19, 2018. It's broken!! Exact experience as the other reviews.  We found the white ring at the bottom of the pool and the vacuum stuck in one spot. Should've listened to previous reviews.  It worked great while it was working.  We glued it but it didn't hold long. A couple months just isn't even justifiable with we got our monies worth.  The plastic connection looks like it was glued together in the first place.<br />Not worth the money folks."
1.0,Bought this a year ago I only wore once and it has a hole in sleeve. Can’t return. So now in 2020 I bought the same sweater just clicked reorder and a completely different sweater came!! From China so no returns!! So pist!! Amazing should stop getting crap from China if it not correct! Faults advertising and selling is illegal!! Walmart 2 day is looking better and better!!!!
1.0,"I had this same bracelet which “lasted from about s full year but I’ll it started to lose its luster and sheen. This current bracelet appeared more cheaply made with an overly pink color and “plastic feel, much lighter in weight, etc. It began to tarnish within 2 weeks of wear leaving a nice green ring around my wrist. The bracelet had not been exposed to soap, H2O, or chemical of any kind. I finally had to pitch it. Not again..."
1.0,Changer color
1.0,"Close to Junk Status.  Within the first two days of use, they were scratched...and not from being dropped or abuses, just from being placed on the dash of the car.  The frame broke within a week."
1.0,"Unfortunately it doesn’t work at all, doesn’t stay in place."
1.0,"These sunglasses were junk...due to a design flaw.  Right about where your eyebrows would be there is a joint, right at the end of the silver piece that would be inbetween your eyebrows.  That joint gives way from time to time and eventually will break...which mine did after only 4 days of use.  But what do you expect...they were 8 bucks!  No harm no foul."
1.0,The picture is fuzzy. You can completely tell up against the crisp writing.
1.0,Awful. Cheaply made pajamas. So disappointed!  Bought for my niece. Accident my paid expedited shipping and I’m almost too embarrassed to give them as a gift. The fabric is so thin I can see right through it. I’m sure they will o my last maybe 1 wash and wear.
1.0,"I like that it’s thin material for a “sweatshirt” however it’s way too small. My friend said it ran small so I ordered an XL because I wanted it to be oversized like a sweatshirt is suppose to be. It’s very tight. Made for a small child in my opinion. I’m a 30 yr old women size 8 usually, so in reality an xl should be oversized on me! Normally I would order a medium to large if I wanted it fitted. I think the sizing is the biggest problem. I probably won’t wear it and will possibly be returning it."
1.0,hated it
1.0,Color was off and didn’t fit right
1.0,Cheap and shapeless. Not attractive at all. Wish I had returned in time.
1.0,"I was so hoping this watch would work for me. However, like every other watch I've had, it stopped. Just stopped after about 3 days."
1.0,Shorts too small size 44 and feel like I’m in a size 38
1.0,"I returned this, to small & you have to have the perfect body shape"
1.0,Productos de tan mala calidad no deben venderse lo ponen en la tarea de tener q devolverlos malo y quebrados
1.0,wore it once and it completely disintegrated. Everything broke apart and there were pieces every were.
1.0,"I get so tired of items saying ""simple instructions,"" ""easy to use."" I struggle with figuring things out, daily/nightly,<br />hours on end, and I cannot set this watch! A waste of time, effort and money."
1.0,Ugly and very thin
1.0,I can't imagine where all he positive reviews came from.  These things didn't make my vision any clearer at all.  I was really disappointed.  Wish I had returned them.
1.0,"Horrible ,"
1.0,No pockets inside was kindof disappointed
1.0,Quit working the second day after we got it. But it was a birthday gift for my 4 year old so I didn't want to take it away from her to return. So I'd say only buy this watch if your child can still enjoy a non-working watch.
1.0,"Wrong pattern wrong color was sent to me, but mostly misleading it has a high waist which if you like a dress that the waist hangs from your boobs then you’ll love it, cheap material cheap! but if you love polyester you’ll love it. I ordered a large, I’m 5’5 135lb 36 bust, I looked a sad version of my grandma."
1.0,"Just like the other tree library earrings, these are cardboard and a bad picture.  Will not buy from this vendor again."
1.0,I was super excited to try on this dress but the size chart didn't help much. I got a bigger size up but that didn't work. So if you are a 2xl with a DDD40 you might need a 3xl. Also I am not a fan of the zipper as it's super thin and tends to never close.
1.0,One of my earrings discolored and lost its gold tone. The company would not replace because the order was over 90 days. They offered to sale me a second pair with a 25% off discount  after purchase is made. I will not purchase again due to the fact the defective item wasn’t replaced.
1.0,Very pretty. But defective. Strap loops weren't sewn properly. Requested refund & they wanted me to pay half & keep it because return shipping was too costly. I said NO WAY. And Had to mention Amazon A-Z guarantee. Only then did I receive a full refund.
1.0,Bad quality.  Broke before first use.
1.0,Turned black jst after one day.
1.0,broke first time they were worn
1.0,Cheap dress! Didn’t care for it!!
1.0,Awful appearance for what was expected! Generic looking with no side slits!
1.0,"Terrible, my toddler was able to pop these off within one day of daycare. Ten dollars down the drain."
1.0,"Not happy I received my order and I received 4 different styles and 5 pair of each style , I was under the impression I would receive more of a variety not 5 pair of the same black earrings 5 pair of the same green earrings 5 pair of the same blue earrings and 5 pair of the same yellow earrings"
1.0,I don't like it but it was cute
1.0,"It was wrong size, too small for a five year old."
1.0,"Bought at Sams club, made me cough everytime I tried to use!!!"
1.0,Wayyyyy too small.
1.0,"No tail, very thin and cheap awful I don’t have anything omg Christmas party 🙁"
1.0,These sandals were too small and the toe strap has already broken and they’ve only been worn once for a wedding!
1.0,"Armholes were cut uneven, so the back was off centered and the front twisted to one side a little. I ordered a much larger size than I normally would, but it was still 1-2 sizes too small for me. Normally I would return and try the next size up, but since this one wasn’t cut correctly in the first place and the material felt like what you would use to make swimsuits except without any stretch, there’s nothing about this dress that I’d want to repeat. Calling it a total loss."
1.0,Product runs too small
1.0,"I ordered the set of 3 black leggings and they stained my laundry, my sheets, my phone case… basically anything they touched. I would give zero stars if I could, ended up costing me a lot of money."
1.0,They do not stick.
1.0,"I ordered 2 sets of sunglasses. Was very excited to use them in my trip to Cancun. Unfortunetly, the first 2 days of wearing them, i noticed the top of my nose being extremely itchy. 2 days later, i realized the sunglasses had BURN my nose bcus the middle part of the sunglasses THAT TOUCHES YOUR NOSE is metal NOT PLASTIC. I now have a little scar on bothe sides of my nose!"
1.0,As gifts
1.0,Just looks good from outside but not solid quality as torned the first time I hung something in it even without any travel.
1.0,Fit true to size but had holes and water soaked through after 2 weeks of wearing them to work.  Very disgusted!
1.0,Way toooooooo small.
1.0,I got this out of the box and it was broken. I am not going to bother with a replacement because I bought two of them and both were broken. They look cheaply made and obviously break easy. Save your money on this one.
1.0,The light on this watch was too bright to see the time in the dark.
1.0,"Ordered X large, package said X- large but label on bra said medium had to give away. Disappointed."
1.0,The hat is small
1.0,This hat was such a disappointment because the opening for the ponytail is about four times too large and looks like an entire bun would fit in there! I gave it away because it just looked silly!
1.0,Hideous material. Very thick black polyester. Looked and felt like I was ready for high school band concert.
1.0,"I got these glasses because of the pink look they had.  They arrived way earlier than expected, which was great, however, they were definitely lacking any pink.  They had no sign of a pink tint to them.  They were yellow and orange.  Regardless, I liked their shape.  I went to try them on, and as soon as I opened them, the arm broke off.  It just snapped, I never got to wear them or try them on.  I know they were inexpensive, but i have purchased $5 sunglasses many times before, and I was able to wear them all the time. I am very disappointed."
1.0,Sucks and don’t try to send it back coast a fortune
1.0,Why the call this Smart Watch ? .. if they want to impress me they did with false advertisement
1.0,They fit well but they are not well made . Fell apart after one washing in delicate cycle and in mesh bag.
1.0,This doesn't glow in the dark as advertised. I have left it outside in the sun for days and no glow in the dark.
1.0,"Don’t bother buying this unless you’re 0% body fat or weigh more than 75 pounds. I bought the extra large, based on previous reviews, where I’m usually a medium. It was so tight I could barely even get it on.  So tight and uncomfortable, no stretch whatsoever.  10/10 would not recommend."
1.0,Hat was received in very poor condition.
1.0,Was not the band advertised
1.0,"Don't waste your money on these boots, they're garbage. I'very had these for about 3 weeks now and the soles are already coming off the boot and the material is coming off the boot. Very poor quality."
1.0,"Description says that material is glass and that the cap and ball can be separated. They are not accurate to the description. The material feels like plastic and they cannot open to put different things inside. Four of them had holes and glitter coming out. They are cute and most are usable, but they do not reflect the description well."
1.0,The quality is about a C.  I bought a “white” sweater but it is pastel yellow in color not a white or cream. Not happy. Item also says it’s a zip front under loop buttons but it is snaps closure. Would buy again in another color.
1.0,Horrible quality and a few of them missing. I can’t believe sellers would ship out less than promised that’s false advertising. They promised 24 pieces but I only got 22. Horrible waste of time and money. I’m so tired of getting ripped off on here.
1.0,Very pretty but it dangerous for my baby. Glitter falls everywhere even though I've washed them twice. My baby almost eat them. Luckily my husband saw it and stopped it. I was very angry when it puts my baby in such danger. That day was her first birthday.
1.0,"Both straps were longer than the original small strap I bought with my Garmin vivoactive 3. One was an inch longer and the other was 3/4 inch longer. Cannot go small enough to fit my wrist. And with the return fee, I'd get back $1. Whoop! Wasted money!"
1.0,I like it so well but I was gifted with same color so i had to return it
1.0,"Lasted for less than two weeks, when one of the band's link pins sheared. I almost dropped the Chronos! I would recommend against purchasing one of these. Looks good, but not worth risking damage to your fenix Chronos, or other expensive time piece."
1.0,Extremely small. Useless if I can't wear it
1.0,I was so disappointed to get these bracelets in the shape they were in. Every last one of them were bent and two as seen in photos had broken parts. They are very fragile and bends too easily. Cannot use them for gifts and definitely not to sell. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,My friend ordered this and it was so cute on her. The one I received was totally see through and not as good of quality as hers. It's the same size as hers however it fits smaller.
1.0,Never for it !!!
1.0,Not happy with fit. The shirt I received did not match the avatar fit it was very off in the sleeve size. Reached out to Amazon to replace it but They said no. They did offer a refund. Shirt was off and service was not adequate for this type of product. Will not purchase again.
1.0,Too wide and too big.
1.0,The white pants are so long they were just above my ankle and I am five 2 sending it backc
1.0,"Disappointed.  It looks cheap,  strings are hanging from the designs on the jeans. And it is handwash only! This is for a little boy! It will get dirty."
1.0,I bought a whole bunch of these for Christmas presents and three out of the bunch came with snags in them and one even had stains on it!  But the others were ok.  I do not recommend buying.
1.0,"Poor quality. Not as described. If you're looking for some skinny pants to lounge around the house, I guess these would work. I was looking for rash guard type pants for under my gi for jiu jitsu. Not what I got."
1.0,Chain broke far too easily. And would not recommend anyone buy this product.
1.0,Should’ve gave it a no star
1.0,Cheap t-shirt not a jersey
1.0,Very small glasses. Fit my 7 year better.
1.0,I bought these for my daughter and she only wore them 3 times before the leafs fell off both earrings.
1.0,bustle is very small. Made for a child
1.0,awful so tacky
1.0,"light comes on very left side of the display does not illuminate the numbers. I still can't read time in the dark.Too much trouble to send back, I'm sorry I bought it."
1.0,"The picture depicted a loose fitting, comfortable shirt. This short look like a children's shirt and was stretchy and tight. I could tell as soon as I took it out of the package that I would be returning it."
1.0,"Returned - The material was so thin, see through, but not breathable. It's that weird polyester material a lot of overseas manufacturers use - it's like waxy polyester.<br />It's super small.<br />I think this will be the last time I try to get a ""deal"" on a cute piece of clothing."
1.0,Ordered in September and initially loved them. A few weeks later one side of my my charger started melted leading me to stop using them for the Bluetooth function. After wearing them for just fashion purposes one of the legs began wobbling like it wants to fall off. Would not recommend if you want to have long term.
1.0,Son buenos porque son cómodos y no se cansa mucho el pie pero en menos de 1 mes ya se rompió la tela 😏
1.0,Neither mask lit up. Returned.
1.0,Sold as an XL hat doesn’t even come close to fitting my head. It’s just a normal sized hat.
1.0,Super cute sandals but the front strap is way too tight. You won’t be able to get any of your toes through. Plus they charge you to ship back and a restock fee when the issue is clearly with the manufacture. Wouldn’t recommend at all.
1.0,Little kid size?
1.0,"I found these to be ill fitting and in a non-flattering fabric.  For a pant with this type of waistband, the fit really needs to be perfect, and on my hour glass hips, the fabirc bunched at the hips and stretched at the crotch.  And the fabric itself doesn't really drape -- it's a pretty basic, not particularly expensive fabric type.  These pants went straight to good will."
1.0,"Really disappointed in the quality of the boots. After being worn 10-15x, the sole ripped out on the toe area of one boot and all the way down the side of the other. For the price paid, we expected much better life. Our return/exchange window closed after 6 weeks, and just 2 weeks before the boot failure."
1.0,Very upset that the box it came in was damaged and opened  it was supposed to be gifted unfortunately the box was defective and theres a unique smell on the shirts
1.0,Ridiculous. Washed once and shrunk to half the size! Not a bargain!
1.0,They need to go back to the manufacturing of this product... the product the bra does not stay up it flips it so does not fulfill its purpose
1.0,This is totally disgusting!  Remove it from your list!
1.0,Purchased my size but it is too tight. It seems I needed to go up 2 sizes in order for it to fit comfortably
1.0,Two out of three shredded the first time I washed them - never used them.  Scared to wash the third one…. Super cute - BUT Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"I have so many pairs of this brands leggings from over the years and I do not like the new fabric they are using. The stitching on the seams where the pockets are is sloppy and unflattering looking as well. I still like their tanks, but sadly the new leggings are a no for me."
1.0,"The Flip Flops were supposed to be for women and the size is too small, they looked like a small size for a  10 year old child.<br />I missed the return time window, know I'm stoked with them."
1.0,It broke right in half
1.0,SEE THRUUUUUU
1.0,It was delivered totally ripped apart like this.
1.0,Wrong bracelet received
1.0,Not true to size! Runs 2 plus sizes smaller!
1.0,"We've purchased a few of these shorts and every single time, the pockets completely ripped open within a month of use."
1.0,This item did not meet my expectation. Broke first night I wore it.
1.0,I checked to make sure I was picking US size and I ordered 2x and it was too small. 😞
1.0,"I clicked that the dress fit as expected, but I don't really know. It was so poorly made that when the zipper was sewn in, they had sewn over the zipper teeth and I couldn't even get it unzipped to try it on. The fabric also felt and looked much cheaper than it did in the photos."
1.0,"This is really ugly, the top looks nothing like the picture. The top is shaped like overalls. Just ugly"
1.0,The inseam is close to 30&#34;<br />The thigh area is to tight also.<br />very displease
1.0,Material is not comfortable. Dont like the fabric thats why returning it .
1.0,You must have a small neck to wear. There are curved metal bars connecting the necklace to the ends that connect. If your neck is too big the curves just hit the sides of your neck and the necklace will not lay flat.
1.0,They come unscrewed very easy.  I lost both in 3 months.
1.0,The stones fell out 2 wks after i received them
1.0,"Missing graphic, and too small. I do NOT recommend"
1.0,I try not to buy clothing items online due to not being able to touch the material or try it on. I thought they can’t be too many bad things on this one since it had a good description. Well I was wrong! At first it didn’t look too bad so I put it on and ran to the gym  The shirt does not stay on your shoulders it’s all over the place. The material is very flimsy and cheap.  I’m either giving it away or throwing it away. I can’t even wear it again.
1.0,"They are cute or whatever,but they made my skin turn green. Not satisfied at all. This is a 1 star for me."
1.0,No support would buy again haven't worn but once disappointed
1.0,It is really pretty but the paint chips off in about a week of wearing it.
1.0,Bought this diaper bag for my son and used it one week and the bag is coming apart at the seams. What a waste of money.
1.0,Size 10 is a little tight. Bad quality because the shoe started to open from sides.
1.0,it it very big and heavy as compared to what you see in pic on amazon. I would suggest a video will help customers better. i must say price was too good.
1.0,"They had a melted soot on the frame under one of the lenses. They look good on but, I was very disappointed that they had the deformity on the frame. I am in the process of returning them."

1.0,Never thought I’d give a product a one star but it came very broken :( I never intended to use this item as a fashion accessory but I’d still have liked it in tact.
1.0,"the description said rosegold/black but the actual color is not rosegold.  It is more like copper color paint on a piece of metal and the paint is not that good either.  Paint smeered on the black area very obvious.  Sorry, i really want to like this band but have to return."
1.0,Gloves stopped heating up after a few weeks of use.
1.0,All sides are just a silver sticker to look like aluminum.

1.0,Style and color I received was not like what was pictured on web at all.
1.0,"Not flattering, not cute and wish I had returned it ASAP."
1.0,"I've been happy with all my amazon purchases but this one sure wasn't one of them.  It looks nothing like the one pictured, looks very cheap.  Won't be wearing it."
1.0,Item came defective- looks like they were sewn
1.0,It was super cheap material. The fabric broke on the headband piece. You get what you pay for the price.
1.0,"I should know from the price. too light, too small and looking like child jewelry. Tried with a chain but too light to look nice on your neck."
1.0,"This crown is Beautiful!! However when we opened it up several jewels had fallen off and a small piece of jewel broke off... this is part of my daughter’s prom queen holloween outfit. She is dissapointed, but  I am getting out my glue gun!"
1.0,Waited a long time fir a very mediocre top.....
1.0,Very very disappointed I had to return it cause it was so so small.
1.0,"Nothing like the picture, very large"
1.0,"I agree with the reviewer that commented that these boxers do not wear well.  In fact, they start to disintegrate after only half a dozen washings.  I do not recommend purchasing this product."
1.0,The glasses are too big for women. The arm pieces are flimsy. The case was soiled. Would not recommend.
1.0,"This dress is the worst thing I’ve ever felt on my body!! I thought I was buying a soft fabric blush pink dress and this is a shimmery thin mess. The fit was great I liked how it looked, but I couldn't wear this dress for even a minute without itching all over. The pictures are so misleading!!"
1.0,Dress did not look sexy like it does in picture.
1.0,"Hard materials, hard soles. Not good enough to wear for playing badminton."
1.0,Horrible! I ordered the short green kaftan and got a long smelly purple one. Buyer beware! I wish I had read the reviews!
1.0,So small couldn't get over my hips. I'm not a large woman.
1.0,"This is an extremely small fit. I normally wear a medium, sometimes a large. I wanted it long, so I ordered an XL.  It’s very small."
1.0,"The scarf is not full like the picture. I found it to be rather skimpy and even when I tried fluffing it up, it looked really anemic. Returned and found something else. Gotta love the perks of Prime."
1.0,PRODUCT  WAS NOT EVEN  CLOSE TO  DESIRED SIZE
1.0,Very poorly cut and constructed.  Shoddy work.
1.0,"They looked loverly online, however, once they arrived the red looked pink."
1.0,Good quality however I ordered the larger size 13 to 1 for my son who wears a 13 and it was way too small
1.0,I wore these for 8 hours and when I took them off there was a green line on my nose. Do not buy if you plan on wearing them longer than an hour. :(
1.0,Fell apart after one use. She loved them but a broke. Don't waste your money
1.0,"The sizing of this set is horrible. I typically wear a size 14, so I ordered an XL (16/18) bc I wanted it to be loose rather than fitted. The shirt of the set is true to size, however the pants run WAY small. The XL (16/18) pants fit more like a 8/10. Since the shirt is true to size, ordering a larger size won't work. The top will either be way too big or the pants will be way too small. Also, I ordered the &#34;love your elf&#34; set which the pants look red with white dots in the picture, but the actual color is more of a pink. Overall very disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,Don’t bother to buy this.
1.0,Gray is To small it’s tight it’s more like an xs or s rather than a l the yellow and green fit perfectly but are sheer
1.0,"This is a warning to all potential buyers, this item is poorly designed, and the 8oz of steel shot sewn within the glove do not adequately protect the knuckles, or any part of the hand that makes surface contact when throwing a punch. You can see in the picture, the surface of the gloves knuckles have foam padding sewn in, and this is what &#34;protects&#34; your hand in regards to actually throwing a punch. You will most certainly hurt yourself relying on a design this inadequate, and even attempting a back-fist strike may result in a broken hand."
1.0,"I had not issue with adjusting the band for my grandfather for his apple watch. Lightweight and good finish.<br />Only major issue we have is that the magnet don't work, if any thing even bump into the watch the band would easily slip off, we almost lost the watch a few time when we would go on out to visit family or doctor visits."
1.0,Very cheap product.. I received broken..
1.0,Biggest piece of junk. Fuzz ball came broken and totally detached.
1.0,The mask was great for what I needed it for but the necklace and bracelet was broken when I received it.
1.0,"I wear a 36C and ordered a large, Way to small i had boob spilling out everywhere. It fit around but the actual boob area was like an eye patch"
1.0,"Es una copia muy regular del fossil, acabados muy malos. No lo recomiendo"
1.0,"The price on this product has increased 100% in 2 years.  It's a nice product, but this is kind of ridiculous."
1.0,"I measure myself before I order clothes and order accordingly. The measurements fit what they suggested, but it was incredibly small. I wish it fit because it’s hella cute, but it was so so small!"
1.0,Too cheap looking I haven't even put it on.... I wish I would make myself return it.......
1.0,"I should have read the dimensions more carefully. None of the pictures show a relative size around someone's neck. You almost need a magnifying glass to see the names. It comes with an equally tiny chain that looks quite fragile. The quality of the pendant seems ok, but just way too small"
1.0,"Necklace is pictured alot larger than it actually is. Very cheap material. And diamond pieces were missing . Not happy . Bought it for my daughters birthday ,she still loved it because it was her initial but im disappointed in the product"
1.0,"I ordered 4 for my 4 granddaughters, only got two of the pouches.  These are not very well made and look it.  Not worth what they cost."
1.0,Do not buy! Mine did not work. Brand new batteries I had just bought. Obviously made sure they were in correctly and...nothing. Did not turn on in any way.
1.0,These earrings look super cool but they don't stay on. There's no way to screw them together. They just slide together and then fall out as soon as you move your head.
1.0,the necklace didn't fit the charm
1.0,"These earrings are made for a baby!  Not a grown woman.  Also, the earrings I received are channel set which I don't care for and the picture does not look like channel set.  I don't think I could ever get these on my ears & I am a small woman."
1.0,"No funciono, nunca prendió tuve que regresarlo"
1.0,"Only one small line in stone, chip in stone, weird blue color, wider than the picture....."
1.0,"Bought it as a gift and the recipient says that it doesn't even latch onto the fitbit body, the latches are too small."
1.0,Hate it it's so small
1.0,Trash product.
1.0,"This is the second time I ordered these inserts. They broke within one week of use. they are terrible, most cards do not fit. Extremely disappointed with the product. Do not purchase this product."
1.0,Band doesn’t fit watch model that is repeatedly featured in post. Would not recommend this band or brand to anyone!!!
1.0,"Facing was damaged (top layer of leather stripped off, like it had been stuck to tape) and clips were not positioned straight/evenly, so it would not attach and hang straight. Waste of money, wouldn't recommend."
1.0,I have a whole bunch of these shirts I order and none of the ladies can use them because they are all too small even the small I order small to Xlarge and they were all the same size.
1.0,Cute BUT Awful material / tag says dry clean only. Who would take a toddler outfit to the cleaners?
1.0,This item arrived Broken..I HAVE never received any order that came in pieces..I won't be getting this again..I didn't like this item period..WOW! Horrible..
1.0,The product *fits* as expected but the material is very cheap looking and feeling. Looks like they sewed a boys cotton T-shirt to the bottom of the top. Not appealing.
1.0,Slides off head bc its polyester
1.0,"Beware!!!!!! my order came with a tear in one of the handle bars and one of the side black plastic covers of the spin wheel broken, I found this damaged once I had already opened the package/box and began building the bike.  The bike really isn't all that easy to assemble like other reviews state, it took about an hour for me to put together, the make-shift screwdrivers it comes with makes it really hard and almost impossible to assemble when using the tools to screw in the bolts.  The minor cosmetic damages didn't render the bike from operating so I saved myself the hassle of having to un-assemble the about 30% portion of the bike I had already built, so to not have to take everything apart again and pack into a fairly destroyed box I just went ahead and lived with the small damages, If I could go back I would've never bought this bike, something in my gut feeling told me it was to good to be true based on the previous reviews, follow your gut feeling and react on your instincts, I didn't and now I feel like I was robbed of $350.00, REMEMBER you get what you pay for.<br /><br />UPDATE APRIL 11, 2019<br />So after having this bike for about 2.5 months now I must say that I was so upset and disappointed that I actually forced myself into going through the hassle of returning it. The resistance knob that is used to turn for heavy resistance and lighter resistance broke. Deeming the bike unusable and non functional. This resistance knob is located right above the water bottle holder and is a red knob with symbol of + and - and the word stop. This knob is held together by some sort of springs inside of the metal tubing of the bikes center mass. Horrible design. Once this knob broke it renders the spin bike useless. I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE YOU WILL REGRET IT.<br /><br />Update 04-12-2019<br />Matters just got worse AMAZON will not be refunding me my full amount of 298.00<br />In addition they are charging me a restocking fee of $70 Even though I bought the insurance for the cycle. Horrible experience from both the seller and AMAZON NOT HOW I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO GET DONE"
1.0,I  didn’t  like  the  material and it was too small but I liked the dress❤️
1.0,No sirven alas 2 cemanas se rompieron ni lo page por ellos
1.0,I ordered an XL and the product is a MEDIUM at best....extremely disappointed. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.
1.0,The fabric is awful.  It is like a cheap nightgown from the dollar store. I will give it to my grandchildren for dress up.  Too icky to even sleep in.
1.0,Feel very cheap and are made of plastic. Would not recommend.
1.0,First of all I ordered these jeans and paid extra to get hem next day shipping.... That didn't happen. When I did get them they were not a crispy white but I could've worked with that had they got past my ankle. I'm usually a size 8 and after reading reviews I saw they ran small. I ordered an XL and I don't know who on this planet is wearing an XL this small. I now have to return them and I hate having to go through the hassle of returning items. I had to go out and buy a pair of jeans which was what I was trying to avoid.
1.0,We bought the correct size based on measurements taken the day before. It couldn't even be buttoned. Do not buy.
1.0,The item fits like a 1x and it's billed as a 4x. Had to sell them because they were too tight.
1.0,Strap broke after 3 weeks.
1.0,I got it an XL but I got it and saw it first it didn't fit just but simply looking at it and it fit my 10 year old sister
1.0,returned ---skinny girls only
1.0,If I could give zero stars I would.. Straps don’t lock into iPhone watch so it’s not secure at all.. and the flowers are printed on so as soon as you bend the strap the flowers crack.. even the replacement of the defective strap purchase was exactly the same! Don’t waste your $$
1.0,These glasses came with 2 different colored lenses. I have contacted zero uv and gotten no response.
1.0,Broke the first night I had it on
1.0,I do not recommend this mask.  The outer stitching is a visible white when black thread should have been used.  The mask is not like it appears in the advertisement.  It bunches up so the logos are distorted.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheap plastic. Broke in 2 days
1.0,"I bought a large, and usually a large is what I wear, if not a medium. It was a bit smaller than expected. Then I washed it. Now, I couldn’t even get it on. You can also tell it’s cheep fabric. Not worth the money"
1.0,It's crap.  I can't believe I spent that much . something that looks line or came from a gum ball machine
1.0,"I loved them, so much that after I recieved my 1st I ordered 2 more right away.. I should have done laudry 1st. Shrunk 2 inches & atlease  a full size. All 3:("
1.0,"It’s a really cute dress, but the pockets give a weird shape to the body. Shift dresses like this are usually awesome and slimming; taking focus away from the tummy and giving a straighter figure, but the pockets attract weird attention to the stomach and are very unflattering."
1.0,"Looks cheap, will never wear.."
1.0,I receive these glasses in the mail and the minute I put them on I realize that I had been taken. The lenses are distorted. Please do not invest in this company is eyewear.
1.0,i'm an american L- maybe XL and i bought this cheap product in an XXL and i can't get it over my head. should be in the children's section!
1.0,Neither XL or XXL fit well. Length was ok but tanks were too wide and bottom of cutout doesn’t fit tight around rib area.
1.0,"I am usually a Large, I ordered a XLarge based on the reviews, however, this top could fit a 5 year old!!"
1.0,Believe missing. Mickey ears missing. Only hearts
1.0,Fits to loose and fits to big not liking them bad choice of purchase
1.0,So cute!  But it hit the floor on my first day at work with it and the bezel chipped right away :(
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture.  Terrible quality, paper thin and cant be worn."
1.0,"Horrible. Womens pants do not open on the right side, these however do.<br />The fabric is flimsy, pulls apart at the seams.<br />To return would cost more as they charge a restock fee. I threw them in the junk pile!"
1.0,"I ordered an xl just in case i would normally wear a medium but most clothes on amazon run small . Well the sleeves are extra long but the shirt is not an extra large but i can get past the size as i can still wear it ,but it doesnt even remotely look like the pictures its clearky a different material its not faded or distressed the buttons are different and the bottom hem has a completely different shape. The picture show a baggy, straight hem this shirt has a tight curved hem like that of a dress shirt ..... im too lazy to return it ... but i will steer clear of this brand from now on .... dont waste your money"
1.0,It came with both buttons on the sleeves ripped off and the sleeves are for someone with 5ft long arms I didn't bother trying to return it because it is such a hassle.😄
1.0,Didn't like it.....looked cheaply made and came directly from China!!
1.0,"Just did not fit right for some reason.  I usually buy Fruit of the Loom.  They just seemed kind of ""baggy"" on me.  I'm 5-10 and weigh about 146 and the medium just didn't look good on me.  Give it shot if you want."
1.0,Awful quality gold rubs off terrible
1.0,Sweet dress but dozing is too small..
1.0,"One star for beauty.  No stars for non-functioning and packaging.<br />I bought two of these watches, one for each of my twin granddaughters, and neither one worked.  The were cute, but definitely not worth the price.  My biggest disappointment of the shopping experience at Amazon this year."
1.0,Low quality. Odd fit.
1.0,"Would have given it no stars if possible. Mine fell to the floor the first time I took it (attached to my key chain) out of my purse. It screeched' til I got the pin back in, but it wasn't very loud. I think it is a very bad design."
1.0,"No reviews but since they were affordable I decided to give these Feeson shorts (Light Blue 2 color) in size small a try.<br /><br />The fit, I'm 5'4"" and 129 lbs with my weight distributed fairly evenly and these fit around the my 28"" waist and 37"" hips fine.  There's also plenty of room in the bum area and the leg openings measured 12"" across so if you have a nice full rear and muscular thighs these may just fit you perfectly.<br /><br />Workmanship, please refer to the pictures, uneven lengths, buttons are not aligned, random circular imprints on the fabric, the cuffs are not straight nor done with any apparent care or pride in the work."
1.0,Its was more like a medium
1.0,It broke after one use. Very sad.
1.0,The description of these are not cotton.  They are like a plastic  table cloth. Very disappointed.
1.0,Hate it unwearable
1.0,"This looked like a dingy version of what they show in the picture. Even my grandma would not appreciate this color. Also, I'm a 30DD and ordered a 34 and it was loose in the band but tiny in the cups. Unfortunately you only get one cup choice per band. So the next size would have been a 36 something. Not a 34c. Thank god it was only $6. A lesson learned never to order from this company again. Also the quality was pretty tacky. I'll stick to American and UK brands."
1.0,Cheap Don't waste your money if you're expecting good quality... invest in a better garment
1.0,These earrings have given me scabs on both ears.  I am not sure what they are really made of but I have never had this issue with earrings before.  I have taken them out for a few days only to put them back in to get the same result.  Horrible.
1.0,I was very disappointed. The bow tie looked plastic and cheap so I returned it quickly.
1.0,"wanted for pjs, won’t touch it with a 10 foot pole now"
1.0,I returned this as soon as I opened the package. Cheaply made and downright ugly.
1.0,I had to return this because it was very small even in an XL
1.0,"Just received my package today, they are so then and made so poorly, 2 of them broke as I was removing from package...."
1.0,Gems fell of nearly all of the jewelry and shoes.  She really loved it if it hadn’t fell apart.
1.0,"These stoppers are the perfect size, but some were impossible to open while others wouldn't stay closed. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,It is a watch band and I use it to hold my watch on my wrist. I hate it because it is so stiff I can hardly get it to bend so I can buckle it. Supple would be the antinyom of this lether.
1.0,VERY POORLY MADE AND VERY CHEAP LOOKING.
1.0,Waaay too big. And then the seller expects you to pay the shipping (again) to send it back.
1.0,"I debated for awhile as to getting these but decided to go ahead and buy them.  When they arrived, I was disappointed because I have bought cheaper earrings that looked just as good and better.I tested the stones with a diamond teser and they didn’t  test as diamonds (thus moissanite)"
1.0,"I hate ordering things that are not easy to assemble or work with. I actually build things for a living, I'm a contractor. This is the strangest buckle and latch design I've encountered. I've never been challenged by a belt before. I have normal belts, flexible belts, tool belts, work aprons with adjustable latches and sliding assemblies.<br />This one is special. It came with two colors, good times.<br /> It came attached to the belt on one end, so I put it around my moderately in shape rotund self, and slid the rest of the belt into the latch. Cool, it fits. Happy = Me.<br />Undo latch. It sticks. I work it back out. Ok, I can deal with that.<br />First part of belt comes out of latch, the cheap plastic with sharp teeth that grab the belt. Now I can't get the first part back into the buckle without a small screwdriver to pry open the brittle plastic.<br />If I was the originator of this design, it would have been created as a gift for my ex wife."
1.0,Very thin material and cheaply made.
1.0,My nose-ring arrived with the white stone loose in the bag. Kind of disappointed i have not been able to wear it yet.
1.0,Materiel not as expected. Will be returning.
1.0,This looked like our beloved Smokey the Bear. Turned out to be political nonsense. Very disappointed. Amazon refunded money immediately. Don't buy this garbage!!!
1.0,Worthless. Don't buy. It is never not tangled up and tarnished after one use.
1.0,"hat looks ok buttttt it comes all bent the f up don't recommend it at all maybe. If they bent it where you can it would be ok,  surprised Amazon allows them to sell this item after all the bad reviews  wow that's  Amazon for you."
1.0,Way too small. The collar placement is on the wrong sid placing right over left instead of left over right in accordance to traditional Japanese clothing.
1.0,don't waste your time or money
1.0,"I wear a size 8 in pants, and the medium is about the size of a skirt for a 3 year old child. It’s so tight it doesn’t give you a layered look."
1.0,"La insignia solo por una cara, aparenta belleza, pero se hacen desechables muy rápido, recomiendo de la insignias solo la bandera norteamericana que aparece por las dos cara y conserva su color"
1.0,Had less than three weeks and the arm broke at the end of the red and stat of the black. Junk would not recommend.
1.0,The material was not like it should have been -was more like xlarge but the print was great
1.0,Cheap material.. balls up first time you wash it.. poor quality..
1.0,One word &#34;FLIMSY&#34;
1.0,Normally where a woman's size 14.
1.0,"The material was weird and although it was seamless it had ridges in it that really bothered our kiddo with sensory processing disorder. He wore it once and we could barely get him to keep it on. It was much tighter than other compression shirts, and he said it was hot and itchy due to the material."
1.0,"Very poor quality , was used for 2 days and already the outside netting has torn as well as small holes in the backpack"
1.0,Super tiny. Would not fit my 18 month. Looks more like a six month size.  Size inside says 90.
1.0,These masks are so big that no one could wear them.  I like the colors and fabric but don't waste your money.  They have no shape to them.  Basically like half a piece of paper shape with big ear straps.
1.0,"they fit well, just see through. 😭"
1.0,Damn..<br /> This thing came falling apart.string visibly hanging and unraveled before I even took it out.
1.0,I bought for my kids and myself and they ripped within 2 days.
1.0,"Baggy and long when I ordered a size larger, too small but still long when I went one size down. Bad bad bad. The distressed look made it look more like long tassels rather than small distressed look."
1.0,It didnt fit what so ever
1.0,Had for a total of 19 days and the frame of the sunglasses just randomly cracked while I was driving home from work.
1.0,The jacket looked exactly like the picture but was lighter feeling than a cheap brand sweatshirt. The only thing that was lined was the hood. It ran VERY small and I could not wear it. I wear an 18 US size and it fit as if it were a 12-14 US size. Cheap material and cheaply made.
1.0,This is a fake pandora.  it's not real silver.
1.0,Pin broke within 30 days.
1.0,Horrible quality. The tassels were falling out as I was taking it out the package. Guess you get what you pay for. Returned item.
1.0,I was very disappointed with the quality of this product; was looking for a nice matching set for photos. The return process has also been an absolute nightmare. Save yourself some time and headache and find you something else!
1.0,strap connector would bind about 1/3 into the slot. would not slide all the way in.
1.0,"the color on this product was a good color, same as on the imagine shown. however a medium fits like an XL. yes there is a tie for you to tie it within the inside, but it makes it looked scrunched and not look right. so when ordering, order a size… maybe 2 smaller for the right look."
1.0,It felt very cheap. The material felt like foam and maybe something more for a costume than for daily wear.
1.0,I purchased for one of my students and he broke them trying to put them on. He used them for about a month.
1.0,My daughter has had this watch for less than two months and the battery has already stopped working. Please keep in mind she didn’t wear this watch daily for a month because she was recovering from surgery.
1.0,"Dislike the return method, so I end up keeping this too small dress. I’m thin and this dress was way to small"
1.0,"It was a xmas gift, I threw away the return receipt. This sweatshirt was way too small  for my son  who I order an extra  large for. Wasn't  happy ."
1.0,"*update, upon further inspection, shirt has clearly been worn as there are pills under the armpits. Contacting for refund.<br /><br />Sadly the shirt reeked of cigarettes when I got it, I hope it washes out! Lovely top, I am 6' and 34DDD, the length is great and the shoulders are very flattering front and back. I am a size 8 and got a large, but I wish I'd gotten a medium."
1.0,"I loved this top when I got it.  I got a lot of compliments on it.  However, after wearing it only 1 time, it came apart at the seams.  I am 5'3"" and weight 130 and I ordered a M.  It fit well, I guess it just wasn't sewn well.  I am so disappointed."
1.0,"Leggings were a waste of money.  Wore them each once and they have piling on all of them on the back of my legs from where my legs touch my chair. Just aweful.  Wish I could return, but don't have any of the original packaging. They will be thrown away."
1.0,Dollar store junk jewelry...
1.0,Way to big for the average persons head
1.0,I ordered the wrong size. No hassle returns.
1.0,It broke after 2 or 3 times that I used umbrella. I bought two umbrellas last June 14 and I cannot return because of the 30-day policy.
1.0,"Cheap, easily damaged, buy something nicer"
1.0,Posts are too thick
1.0,Espantoso
1.0,"Not the actual dimensions as described. Sunglasses are meant for kids, teens but not adults.<br />it also mentioned free returns and when I tried to return the sunglasses it said I couldn't return it."
1.0,This top was nothing like the picture they show on Amazon. I normally wear a medium and it was so small. Not nearly as cute as the picture.
1.0,No support for bigger chested ladies. (44dd) bottoms are good
1.0,"Material is scratchy. Runs very small, xx large is like Small to Medium"
1.0,To tight on feet. I wear an 11 and these were very snug plus hard and uncomfortable.
1.0,WRONG  COLOR THIS LOOKS NOTHING LIKE DRESS I ORDERED!! The dress in photo looks pretty and nice this one is cheap T-shirt material! Wrong color and I’m LIVID as this was to be pretty sunny time  dress for my ANNIVERSARY PARTY!!! This is AWFUL and now NO TIME TO FIX AND GET ANOTHER BEFORE EVENT AS ITS THIS NEXT WEEK  27th!!! Soooo UPSET!!!
1.0,We had to return this as it was missing metal pieces for the hood
1.0,"First, I paid for two day shipping and did not receive the item in two days.  To make matters worse, I ordered the &#34;Daughter&#34; bracelet and they sent me the &#34;Sister&#34; bracelet.  The bracelet I received was just like the daughter but says sister instead.  It is cheap looking and of a poor quality.  Not something I would want to give to a loved one."
1.0,Size was waaaaay smaller than expected.  I bought a medium or large (can't remember for sure) and I normally where a 6-8 in women's.  Ended up fitting my 10 year old son perfectly so we didn't return it but I wouldn't buy another one.  Material was not loose and comfy feeling like it looks in the photo at all.
1.0,Don't bother stone isn't a stone! It's not pink its white see through plastic!!!!! Cheapest thing I've ever seen!
1.0,These rings were very pretty and I couldn't wait to put them on. I should have waited. I only had them on for a few hours before they turned my fingers green and the silver and pink color came of. Save your money.
1.0,"I was excited to get these tie dye pajamas because at home, I'm all about comfort.<br /><br />I couldn't even get these on. I ordered X-Large, there was no tag on the product that I could find, but I could barely fit one leg in there. Also, the top piece, the sweatshirt, is a cropped top. In the picture it shows the top coming to the top of the pants. That is not so, it's short! In my case, I'd nearly be showing underboob. Not. Cool.<br /><br />They were also not soft. The material was scratchy-maybe that would be better with a wash, but in my case, why would I even wash it?<br /><br />I'm bummed, because the only good thing I can say about this set is that it's pretty."
1.0,I only had this apron less than a month and it ripped at the seam.. poorly sewn? Idk.. but it wasn’t like it was too small so I was very disappointed
1.0,"Thought I was getting a great purchase at this price, but they just don’t last and they were only used for school and playground."
1.0,"I will not return these bc I tried + wore them but...I have no idea what they think a 1x is size-wise. I took the padded inserts out (?) and...NOPE. band was tight and rolled up, cup area too small."
1.0,"Not even the product shown in the picture. All the seams are sloppy. The fabric is cheap, like a Halloween costume. The color of the top and bottom are different. Again, not even the product shown in the picture."
1.0,"did not work, returned."
1.0,The bracelets I received are very ugly. The patterns & colors were drab and dreary.
1.0,Very very cheap looking
1.0,First high wind and the aluminum broke.
1.0,"Was defected, had a large scratch on the front"
1.0,Very poorly sewed tore the first day on the straps
1.0,The earrings were broken. So very disappointed
1.0,"I wanted to like these. I really did.<br />But after a seriously swollen ear and then removing a plug to find a bright blue ring from where the color bled, I’m warning people to stay away.<br />EDIT: I was using the clear plugs, since I was certain there wasn’t going to be an issue with the color rubbing off. Only to have it shatter in my ear when trying to adjust the o-ring."
1.0,They seemed like a big chunk of fabric.
1.0,"I’m a 1-2x, my breasts are a full C up to a D, it doesn’t fit. I can get it on, but it looks bad because it is too small. The back rides up very high, preventing the middle of the shirt from remaining below the breasts where it belongs. The straps/fabric that crisscrosses is too short, that’s what causes it to ride up. It’s slightly stretchy, but not stretchy enough to compensate for that issue. I should return it, but it’s not worth the hassle. Mine is going in the trash."
1.0,Product is not true to size. Runs at least 2 sizes too small! Initiated a refund shortly after delivery received and almost 6 weeks from returning dress still no refund.
1.0,"Huge, heavy, did not stay on her head. She hated it."
1.0,Does not stretch when you put on.. im a small girl these are junk not comfortable will not wear!
1.0,Not slim fit. Not for short people. (Size M)
1.0,"Buyer beware.  This came from China so their version on an extra large is about the size of a medium.  This is not an official NFL shirt, there is no hologram logo on the tag.  Very dissapointed."
1.0,We had a pair of toddler size 9 and loved them.  Recently received little kid size 1 and they are huge.  They are almost as big my shoe and I am a women's 9.  No way he can wear them.
1.0,Worn! Dirty with lots of dog’s  fur
1.0,"Fits extremely weird, huge is some areas, tight in others. I have short torso and it was too small. I do not recommend"
1.0,"I love the design and the look, but they run really small. I'm unable to wear my bracelet and I have small wrists. This bracelet is child small not adult small."
1.0,Made cheaply and too large
1.0,THE PANTS ONLY HAVE ONE HOLE FOR THE DRAWSTRING TO COME THROUGH!<br />Not worth the buy in my opinion.<br />Also the zipper was extremely hard to pull.
1.0,Not what I expected!!! It does not flop how I will like it to.
1.0,"I ordered the gold one because I like my silver one so much, but it arrived with the paint/metal/whatever flaking off and the box was filthy. I returned it. I still like my silver one though."
1.0,Was broken when I received it.Not happy with this purchase...
1.0,Glasses broke in less than two weeks of use very unhappy
1.0,"When the necklaces arrived they both said &#34;to infinity &#34; that's not what was advertised.  This was a birthday present for my daughters friend, so she was really disappointed.  The hassle of doing a return didn't seem worth it."
1.0,Ripped up easily
1.0,Way too small to be size 13. Shouldn't be advertised as size 13. Size 11 at most.
1.0,"Too small. Like, way too small."
1.0,The pieces I received where dirty looking.  I will try to get it polished.  But I wish they would use an accurate picture for the products. but shipping & length of the pieces where correct.
1.0,Would of been nice if the stitching was seen right on it very poorly made
1.0,The shape was odd and nothing like the picture even when it was wrinkle free
1.0,These pants run very very small
1.0,These are very hard bands and become very uncomfortable fast
1.0,Honestly i thought it really was a natural rainbow quartz. it looks and feels more lile a painted piece of glass. not nearly as beautiful as it looked in the pica
1.0,The material is very coarse and is not all way stretch. It feels like what a matching band uniform is made of or something and color wasn't as show.
1.0,Horrible material. Save your money.
1.0,If you want to buy anything says made in China forget about it. 0000 quality you won’t see any quality. If you go based some of those 4/5 stare reviews it means your screwed yourself and you cheated yourself. All those 4-5 star reviews are 100% fake and make their product look good get customer’s attention. I’m telling you if you wear it and go outside make sure you should have a another pair extra otherwise you would get home naked and everything will hanging and make sure wear underwear to be safe.
1.0,"Horrible!! Wish i had the option to give zero stars! Terrible material, not as advertised. A total scam! I returned it as soon as I saw the garbage I received, it’s been over a month and still haven’t received my refund!"
1.0,The product is damaged
1.0,poorly made. Used one time and strap tore so I returned it.
1.0,"Completely see through!!! Not just a little but where it shows silloette,  they are completely sheer only way to wear them out is over leggings !"
1.0,Resealed
1.0,"Ohhhh, no....I didn't know &#34;PU Leather&#34; meant PLASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!  I feel so foolish."
1.0,Muy pequeño y de muy mala calidad
1.0,This shirt is a total joke. It’s like they took a sticker and slapped it on a shirt. The shamrock picture is awful and there is no glitter. Save your money !
1.0,Frame came completely shattered with glass shards everywhere. Very dangerous. I'm extremely disappointed.
1.0,"Fabric was weird, not comfortable at all, and ran small in size"
1.0,The headband is no very good and was not made very well the knives are very very small and the only thing I really like are the stickers.
1.0,Weak magnets don't stay in place
1.0,The material reminds me of a Halloween costume you'd purchase at Walmart.  Cheap and extremely small to size.
1.0,The 3XL looks more like a small.
1.0,"I really wanted to love these boots...I am a big fan of this brand. However, there is no support at the ankle and with the wedge heel, its worse than walking on stilts. I had read some bad reviews on this style, but went ahead and purchased a pair anyway. I returned them without hesitation."
1.0,"Way to big and baggy, not at all like the previous one I bought (exactly the same product, same size, different colour) How do things vary so much?! Gave it to my son......"
1.0,My white band broke within 3 days. I am very disappointed
1.0,"No worth for the money, cheap quality"
1.0,Looks really cute in photo but is not even silver in color once it arrived. Color is tarnished out the bag and looks like junk.
1.0,"Looks shiny and feels cheap, I threw it away. I also bought Hadley Roma it is more expensive but it looks great and I really recommend that brand in general."
1.0,Too small! Size is very off!
1.0,I  wore them once and they got a run in them.
1.0,Was sent two different sizes shoes
1.0,I purchased this not to get sunburned but my nips are only covered by sheer see through mesh.  Who the heck designed this?
1.0,The crotch area wasn't sewed correctly. It made me look like a 🐪 toe and it just wasn't what I expected. I will not be buying these again.
1.0,"I am 5'7 and 120 lbs, this is too small for me, way too small for my torso and I don't have a particularly long torso. The material seems like it would be comfortable but it is made for people 5'4 and under I would say and should have something indicating it is for short women."
1.0,"I did ask the seller. It’s not really silver but plate over copper. The ring looks cheap. It doesn’t have a good sheen, it looks like it came from a gum ball machine. Do what you like but I sure wouldn’t give this to anyone."
1.0,Terrible quality!The zipper broke the first day I tried to put it on.
1.0,Didn't really like the material it was like a graduation gown not my style
1.0,Poor quality! A trap?
1.0,very poorly made....it's going to snap first time i wear it
1.0,Wasn’t impressed open my package up to one button coming off and the flannel was super thin
1.0,"I ordered a Large, received a 2X. The 2X are way TOO SMALL. I do not want them at all! I must return. The sight of them infuriates me. One pair was tried on. Im returning the other pair. Extremely dissatisfied."
1.0,"I bought my first one of these two years ago. It was a great watch; it was beautiful; it kept good time, and I loved wearing it. A year later the battery ran out. I set it aside and used another. Last week, I decided to get a battery for it because I missed wearing it. Well, I could not remove the back. So I ordered another watch just like it. It arrived yesterday, as beautiful as ever. But, it either had a dead battery or it just did not work. I did not want to scratch the case back trying to get it off, so I returned it. My guess is that they still have old stock with old, dead batteries. Disappointed."
1.0,Cannot charge earbuds
1.0,"Had to return it. This dress is made from stretchy fabric but that's not a good thing in this case. All it did was accentuate the things I try to hide. I'm 5'5"", 150 lbs and the medium fit but just didn't look good. Sizing up might help but the fabric is really cheap and it's not worth the effort to try again."
1.0,"For extremely skinny feet only. If you have wide or close to wide feet, you will find these extremely tight and uncomfortable. My advise is to look elsewhere."
1.0,Very bad item
1.0,Very flimsy looking. I returned it.
1.0,Way too small and the wrong item was sent.  I am 5’5” and 135 lbs…large was way too small and the material is really thin.
1.0,The threading it WAY to short to fit in any of my dermal Piercings. Not<br />Sure if mine is just defective or if all are like that. It cute but it won’t go in being that short.
1.0,Item is not like the picture and it showed up in the wrong color. Very disappointed. Picture is very misleading.
1.0,Look like a dress for the 70’s🙁😡
1.0,The dress is nicely cut and great concept but the material is awful very cheap looking.  I'm returning the white/blue and white/black asap.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend these two colors dresses.
1.0,"I love everything about this band...except, after a short time the links don't stay shut...so now I have a beautiful band...that is completely unusable."
1.0,They are turning my skin green 😡 I do not recommend these!
1.0,It fit like baggy pajamas
1.0,did not look like the picture at all. buttons were very small with no bunching on the hip
1.0,"The shirt looked good and I loved it.  I use a professional laundry service, and when they washed the shirt it shrunk.  It is not too short to wear.  I contacted the seller and asked if they had another material or something that I could order that would stay the proper size.  They have not bothered to respond."
1.0,Bought XL. Did not fit me and I got XL just in case they ran small in size.  The fit my 6 and 8 year old grandkids.
1.0,This hat is not red like the picture shows or the description states. It is a dark maroon. It doesn't match any of the outfits I purchased it to go with. The only positive is that the sizing is dead on and it fits my head perfectly.
1.0,No me gustó la tela .
1.0,It was not what I expected. Do not waste your money.  It was made of cheap fabric ant a horrible fit.
1.0,No crown insert so it arrived with a dead battery. Had to return.
1.0,"I loved this from the moment I got it. It warms well, it's comfy, it's perfect. Except I bought it a month ago and it's already broken. The battery is fully charged, it reads 100. When I plug it into the jacket, that 100 drops to 00 immediately and the jacket won't turn on. However! Put it back on the charger and it reads 100 again. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,Fits me too small
1.0,Not an adult size.
1.0,Terrible in so many way. I returned.
1.0,keychain broke right after I got it and I lost my work keys... not good
1.0,Didn't fit me properly.<br />I'm 5'4 180lbs. Small waist big butt.
1.0,Do not waste your money... the key chain broke the first day just like the other reviews stated ... I wish i read them b4 ordering..do not waste your money...very embarrasing as i purchased for a gift....
1.0,My daughter is a petite 4 year old. She has 4 GK leotards in a CXS. For some reason this one is smaller than all the rest. I put a picture up for comparison! I am trying to contact the seller. I’m hoping this single leo was maybe tagged wrong. I will update my review after contacting them. It’s so pretty but does not fit her. Same brand and size. I took photos of another one as comparison.
1.0,I haven't bought the product but the illustration with the pink background and cat is definitely by Higuchi Yuko one of my favorite artists. I doubt she makes any money off of this product or gave permission for this which is a shame. I understand this sort of thing happens all the time so it's easy to brush it off but even if you do or do not choose to buy the wallet please check her out. She deserves at least recognition.
1.0,"I figured it would run small, however a 5XL did not fit on someone wearing an XL jacket. Consider all sizes to be for children."
1.0,See through. Returned.
1.0,Rayon but the tags and product description say cotton.  I returned them because rayon when the heat index is hovering around 100 is a recipe for a menopausal hot flash.<br /><br />It's a shame because the fit and cut were good.
1.0,Extremely undersized all over!
1.0,these things fell apart after only two wears. the inseam split right up the middle.
1.0,"The worst. Zippers split constantly, beginning literally the first wear. And yes, I bought the correct size for my chest circumference. Really cheaply made. Don't waste your money!!!"
1.0,Waaaaaay too small too use for septum. Otherwise they came well packaged and we're beautiful.
1.0,Color runs when washed. Disappointing since this is not a cheap scarf.
1.0,The the design is on the picture is not the same when you get the dress I got 3 dresses because was for a gift and now I am stuck with 3 dresses it's no look like the picture.
1.0,Soft fabric but too small for xl
1.0,Terrible. What a glittery mess. Put it in the donation box
1.0,I work as a CNA and figured this watch was a good alternative to a wrist watch that always gets in the way of handwashing. I have used it 3 times and the smiley face came right off. Apparently the smiley face is only a sticker. Don't  waste your money.
1.0,The lining is tearing up everywhere on the inside. The only thing I love is the color now
1.0,The dress is not satin and is noting like the photo. Did not try the dress on so I do not know if it even fit but it does not look bad just not what I thought I was paying for or wanted.
1.0,I wanted satin sleeping caps but these are plastic conditioning caps. Not happy about that especially since I bought 2 packs for me and my girls.
1.0,"This picture is misleading, they have the item scrunched up on the front of the ankle (if you wear it that way it is very uncomfortable). In reality, it is a flat tube with no heel actually accounted for in the construction."
1.0,"You get what you pay for, low quality plastic. Child's sized glasses, won't fit my average sized head"
1.0,Fit is all wrong
1.0,"I never saw what it looked like, because it snapped apart in my hand as I was trying to put it on. I would think that a headband would be able to, you know, go on your head. Also, it looks pretty cheesy in person."
1.0,"Its polyester, its not cotton<br />Just not what i expected from the pictures thats been provided"
1.0,"It’s easy enough to print a picture the correct size and place it in the photo holder, but the lens does not stay in place and it doesn’t come with any adhesive."
1.0,Setting up the watch according to the instructions was complicated. Just received the watch on the 11th and today is the 20th and the watch completely stopped working. Screen went out and can’t return because I threw away package assuming I had a great buy!
1.0,I was VERY disappointed with the poor quality of this item. I had the same one for years and it was exactly like the picture. When it broke I looked for months for another before finding this one. Same picture but not same quality. The casting was poor the detail was poor and the green marble looked like someone colored it with a sharpie.  I’d love to find another that looks like the picture they show but this is not the one for me for sure.
1.0,Very weak connectors which come loose easily and unscrew randomly.
1.0,"I got the same bag in another pattern and LOVE that one. This, however, is a heavy canvas which looks nothing like the photo, smells like it was locked away in a wet closet for a couple years, and made my shoulder red and itchy. Needless to say I’m returning this one..."
1.0,No agarra bien y se resbala de los brazos
1.0,"I have VERY skinny calves and ankles and these cut off my circulation.  These CANNOT be for adults.  Waste of money.  If you are an adult, do not bother purchasing these."
1.0,s*** quality gloves. I have tan hands and you can see the pigment through the gloves making the gloves not look white. The gloves are not as long as shown in photo.
1.0,I had to buy my own wig cap the ones that come with this item do not work at all. And the bald head still shows hair as you can see in the photo.
1.0,"Waited several weeks for this shirt, only for it to be damaged. Spot on the front looked like it had gum rubbed into the material (but it wasn't). No clue what it was. No way was I going to return it due to hassle. Would never have knowingly ordered something coming from China."
1.0,Cheap made. Cord is not leather. It's more like a plastic.
1.0,:( I am still waiting to get this charm. I have bit even gotten it in the mail! So i cannot review this with anything more.
1.0,Really cheap looking. The spiders were bent and did not recover after being removed from packaging.
1.0,horrible color.  never saw a color like this.
1.0,These run a size small and not comfortable.
1.0,No photo because I sent it back. It was not as picture. The picture shows a Harley-Davidson emblem and there is none on the bracelet receive. I ordered both big and small and they are two different bracelets the small is actually bigger.
1.0,Returning what is a bright hot pink tunic. Tunic is not even close to the color model is wearing when selecting to order watermelon red. Tunic was also very short for a person measuring 5’ 8” tall.
1.0,"Not what I expected,"
1.0,Jewels fell out first day
1.0,Case was cracked
1.0,Texture of the material is awful. I will never wear it.
1.0,its fully open in the front a wardrobe malfunction waiting to happen
1.0,Band to hard to adjust wrong tool
1.0,This is so bad y'all I was so disappointed I guess this happens when you order something this cheap;( is all plastic :(
1.0,Had to return xxl was more like a small
1.0,"liked color, style.  brim too large---did not fit well on head----kept falling down"
1.0,This shirt is very thin. The letters were all stuck together. It seems very poorly made. My granddaughter is wearing it for a work shirt due to it's appearance.
1.0,Porqué  el elástico  se rompe  y no es bue material
1.0,Color is off. The black top doesn’t match the black bottom. It’s almost blue. Not happy wit it. Missed my return window.
1.0,Wow...
1.0,"This is not a leather pearl choker,  it's a bead glued onto a plastic string and it cannot be closed. What a waste of money! 😡"
1.0,Dress tore underneath the arm after one wash on gentle cycle and it was hung dry.
1.0,Way too small. It was a gift. Too late to return
1.0,These shoes are cute but they sent me the wrong size. The label on the bag said 11 but when I pulled them out they were a 14!! I will use them for my daughter in a year.
1.0,Real mente no me gusto
1.0,This was stiff and when i washed it it shrunk.  Not worth it
1.0,It was a great hat but to big.
1.0,I don't like the material. Looks very cheap.
1.0,"This bracelet is not stainless steel.  It’s too thin, too light and hollow.  I have 3 stainless steel bracelets because of allergies.  They are all heavy and none are hollow. I couldn’t even feel this bracelet on my wrist."
1.0,The fabric feels super cheap and it's too short. Like a long shirt
1.0,"I ordered the black mang hat that is peddled as &quot;condor&quot; and what showed up was something that looks like it was made in someones in house sewing shop, it's terrible. It doesn't fit well and the velcro where the morale patch goes is about 1/3 the size as the velcro on my other condor hats. Total rip off!! Not sure if the other colors are legit condor, but definitely stay away from this one."
1.0,It was poorly made. Because of how the sequins were sewn on it was itchy.
1.0,"The glasses can in the mail broken. When I opened the package, there was a chunk of the lens broken off."
1.0,great hat at a great price love it will buy more in the future!
1.0,Fell to pieces once taken out of bag.
1.0,Material is very thin. Not impressed with the quality. Also took a long time to arrive.
1.0,The dress is pretty but not as shown in the picture the bust area is too big and very tight in mid section cheap material
1.0,"Came super fast, however, the part that is to go in your ear is very thick. I would not be able to force this in my ear lobe without lots of pain. Not for me!"
1.0,It doesn't work. It took about a month to arrive so maybe the cold weather caused it to break? Did anyone else have issues with their watch?
1.0,Totally stupid. Has no buttons for changing a diaper. Never would’ve ordered if I knew that.
1.0,I used the product and I was pleased however after the FIRST wash it came apart.
1.0,I bought this because we stone floors and my baby's knees would get red from crawling. Unfortunately they don't stay up very long after I put them on him and scrunch down to his ankles.
1.0,The problem with this chain was that it was too thin. Made me feel weird and the clip was too small.
1.0,Doesn’t look anything like the picture. The shape is totally wrong.
1.0,Material was not great and size was not at all accurate.
1.0,Discolored/ yellow tinge/ some threading coming undone.  I am going to return it.  It looks used and worn even though the tags are on it.
1.0,"They didn't fit right, they had an odd cut for the size. I had to return them and order a different brand.  For the right body type they would be alright, the quality seemed good."
1.0,This leather bracelet broke after the first wear and it smelled so awful.
1.0,"The fabric is too stiff more like canvas and every time you lift your arms the whole shirt go up with them, definitely runs on the smaller side I would recommend get a size bigger, I'm 5'9"" 150 lbs athletic complex and it was too small, the color and look are awesome but not comfortable at all"
1.0,"This was very cheap material, and looked liked a shower cap with straps. Do not recommend."
1.0,"The product fabric is flimsy and feels like wearing a thin scarf.<br />For someone who is 5'1 and petite, it was too large for me and I was floating in the smallest size.  Had to return it."
1.0,"Cheap material, I put the top on right before leaving for a party and noticed inside the truck there was already a snag in the front of the top.  Not even good for one time use!"
1.0,Has a band at the bottom and is shorter than appears in pic.  The fabric is a weird polyester.  The style is nothing like the pic.
1.0,"I order size 12 , but received size 16. The label attached in the back shows 16, but the tag says 12.Sizes do not correspond. Want to return ."
1.0,Too big and chain is broken already!! Very cheap looking and cheap quality
1.0,Wicked cheap looking and it’s uncomfortable. Worst buy on amazon to date!
1.0,"I thought it was cute, it took forever to steam out the folds and wrinkles.  Then I only wore it once and it snagged on EVERYTHING!  So DISAPPOINTED!  Waste of money."
1.0,Inner ring is too small to connect screws to the main frame. This is unacceptable and should have been caught in Quality Control.
1.0,The straps were too long
1.0,Returned due to quality
1.0,It's tarnished and the donut clasp is broken and won't even open. Now I have to go buy a new clasp to even wear it. Very disappointing.
1.0,Dress came used it looked like someone threw up on it I’m completely disgusted......GROSS
1.0,The photo shows a 3.5 inch waistband however the actual elastic band is only .5 inches. Not for you if you're looking for a full wide waistband.
1.0,Thought this would be totally cute on my niece.  Yuck!!!  Nearly crop top length and super wide :-/
1.0,"Muy mala calidad el brazalete con aserradura rota, nada de plata"
1.0,They were too large 3xl was sent. I tossed it in the trash.
1.0,The one I got looks more like a 1st run prototype. The yang is painted on the edges are rough. The pendant is very fat like 1/3 inch and it has nicks in it. It came with a string.  I bought a good one years ago on vacation in a gift shop (much more reasonable price). I would return it but it was shipped concealed so I had to open the package to inspect it. Delivery was fast and reasonable I just expected a better quality product from a jewelry store. (Maybe it was costume jewelry and I missed it in the description?)
1.0,Extremely tiny earrings<br />Really nothing like the picture<br />You can’t gift them to anyone
1.0,Skirt was very fitted.
1.0,"I was extremely disappointed with this dress. Poor, poor quality, I ordered an xlarge, the dress didn't even fit my mother who wears a small - medium. 8 felt the description of the dress was not even close to the product I received. The material was rough, no give whatsoever. It was a waste of my money and has made me extremely leery of ordering any thing else in clothing, certainly from this company."
1.0,"These shoes unfortunately fell apart my sons first time wearing them. They seemed great initially and he said they were really comfortable. Howeve, before the end of our day at the water park the shoes/socks had completely come apart at the seams. My 7 yr old’s toes were completely out of the front of both shoes."
1.0,"It may not be fair to give these glasses a low rating, however, they didn't fit my glasses so what can I do.  They may fit someone else's glasses and be just fine for them.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to determine the size ahead of time.  I found other sunglasses on another website that fit, but that was because they had a chart matching the size and shape of prescription eyeglasses and the size of their sunglasses."
1.0,These are absolutely NOT touch screen compatible gloves. The only difference in the fingertip was the color. Very disappointed.
1.0,What is with this skirt!?!  I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  This &#34;long maxi&#34; hit me mid-calf and I'm only 5'8&#34;.  The skirt was see through which my husband noticed instantly.  The top 'high waisted' area fit so wrong.  It just didn't fit correctly at all.
1.0,"I did a search for LARGE HUE CURVY-FIT LEGGINGS and this popped up.  I questioned what the ""S"" stood for thinking it was ""SHORT"".  However, it meant ""SMALL"" which should have been spelled out in the write-up or title.  Shame on them!  Need to return."
1.0,Love the glasses but the lense fell out the first time wearing them!
1.0,These feel cheap as Hell. something you'd pick up from a dollar store not worth almost $20
1.0,Not what it looked like in the photo
1.0,"This is a nice hat, but it came crammed into a plastic bag the size of a 1 qt storage bag.  It's too late to return it, I need to wear it next week.  I am trying to block it out and hope it will be wearable.<br />Why would the company pack a broad brim hat into a tiny little bag?"
1.0,"Unfortunately the pieces didn’t go well together so assembly was an issue. We worked it out but it wasn’t ideal. Then it was worn for about 2 hours and the strap came off. We used tape to get it back on and within 20 minutes of that fix the front just fell off right where it attaches. It broke right where it didn’t fit well to begin with. So now we are attempting another fix with tape. I realized it wasn’t a sturdy item when I was buying it, but this downright fragile. If I can’t touch the thing without it falling apart it is utterly useless. Hopefully nothing else will fall off, crack, or break. It needs to last for a couple more hours while worn on the back and then for a picture shoot. Frustrating!"
1.0,"Top is Asian size, TINY even though I ordered XL. XL Bottom piece is about a sz10, which is my size and fits fine.  Wish they would sell these bathing suits as separates. Also I thought the ad for this suit said there were inserts in the top that you could take out--NOT so. I had to cut into the fabric and cut the inserts out. Still not great. But will wear it outside ONLY to do gardening in my private yard. Will not be wearing it to a pool or beach, top is too small."
1.0,Description says 2 pack but be careful this is not true. Also the tag on the box says: BSEEN Led Armband 2 pack but comes with 1 armband only.
1.0,Nothing like the picture....it makes me look like a pirate.
1.0,terrible fit unless you like that goofy hipster look
1.0,"Loved everything about it but the way the top only covered my breast area, I'm 5'7"", 151lbs, and the medium was great.<br /> The length was perfect but it was as if, it was an empire waist and not like on the model, where it fits the entire bodice.  I sent it back, it was NOT a flattering look."
1.0,My oldest daughter loved these earrings - thank you - thank you - she is not easy to please
1.0,I don't know?
1.0,"Cheap material, not cotton"
1.0,The sizing is off. You may need to size up. I ordered a 3 pack and they were not the same size at all. I returned them.
1.0,Do not like it... it does not fit and it LOOKS fake.
1.0,"Terrible product, the item was damaged upon receipt from seller and upon further inspection it was revealed that this item was more likely to break anyway. The rubberized portion of this bracelet was made with inferior materials."
1.0,"cheesy looking, and cheap."
1.0,"The colors are vibrant and the case is very compact.  However, the frames were too big and fell off of my nose quite easily and my head is large for a women.  They were not at all simple or easy to open and wear. Twisting and unclipping was involved to open them but the material, plastic, was not going to stand the test of time."
1.0,"Waaay too small.  I have size 12 feet, but I doubt they fit size 8.  Only positive is that they fit my girlfriends size 7 feet so they weren't a total waste."
1.0,The quality of this earrings are very poor.  I purchased them to wear for a breast cancer event.  The top was in my ear and the bottom fell off. The color was a much darker pink than the ad picture.  I accepted that.
1.0,They are super cute and my daughter liked them. The reason for only giving one star is due to one of them were extremely hard to close and the closure part bends due to force it taken to close the earring properly.
1.0,Didn't like fabric or size. Sent back.
1.0,It has horrible smell and totally unrealistic.
1.0,Cheap product. It came damaged and the size was wrong. I would never buy from them or would I recommend it.
1.0,"The material is as cheap as you can get: think table cloth. The fit was terrible. And it's not a blazer at all. Just terrible. I'm not sure why so many people left so many great reviews for this thing, because it's a disgrace. And then there was the fit. I wear a size 16 and I bought a 3X and it was snug,"
1.0,definitely not surgical steel. gave me an infection within hours
1.0,Is to cheap 🖓
1.0,The product ripped upon first use. Not only that we ordered a considerably larger size for the baggy look and it was 2+ sizes smaller than expected when it arrived. The material is largely see through and the drawstrings have so much friction they frayed upon lacing.
1.0,It is a plastic toy watch junk
1.0,I would be interested in this watch and the various color makeups but that it says &#34;Sparkle Star&#34; on it throws every ounce of would-be masculinity out the door. No thanks.
1.0,"These are not wearable unless you have a huge head.  Material is nice and stretchy which is what I was looking for, but they’re way to big! I wasted money on these"
1.0,"The shoes arrived and immediately smelled like a factory. When I put them on, the front straps were so stretched my foot slid right out of the front. The back strap/ties were made so cheaply that they wouldn’t stay tied neither! And last, the front row strap were tucked under the shoe and made it so uneven and I leveled the shoe wouldn’t stand up straight. This made it more uncomfortable to walk in."
1.0,These were way to small they were cutting into my sons skin.
1.0,They was so small (tight) I couldn't get them but just past my ankles.  Total waste of money and I am so disappointed because I wanted these to wear in honor of my grandson with DS
1.0,The picture of the model indicates a loose wrap that hangs well below the bottom area. This would be true if this was a picture of a 5 year old.  I am average Med-Large - aprox 10-12 women's and this thing would not even cover my chest in the front it did not hang low enough to cover the fanny at all. Total misrepresentation of size with the picture.
1.0,Color in every picture is a nice rich blue. The band I received is light baby blue!  The image is also not super clear. It’s muted/fuzzy looking like it’s not in focus.  I was also supposed to have silver hardware instead of the black I received so it won’t match my watch at all!! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!
1.0,This was horrible and not at all like the photo.
1.0,Took forever to arrive and not worth the wait.
1.0,Cheap metal loop so I couldn’t even straighten it out or move the chain through the loop. It’s off center which is why I needed to move it. The crystals pop out easily. They looked pretty from a distance but the craftsmanship is horrible.
1.0,"I was really dissatisfied. The outfit, color wise did not match, they were made out of very very thin material, to a point where the pants are spread so thin you can see the full view of child’s underpants. And the sweater was way too small & short to compensate in the least bit. : /"
1.0,"Flimsy material, the design stretched out over my belly.  Sleeves were very tight also, and I'd ordered a size larger than I usually wear."
1.0,wasn't what i expected
1.0,So thin and see through .. very cheep fabric
1.0,Material feels fine however the item runs small and one of the decorative items fell off before the first wear.
1.0,Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY. I read the reviews and thought somehow I would be ok because I know my size and have ordered online for years. The price is too good to be true. Took weeks to arrive. Ordered brown and received blue. The cut of this garment through the shoulders is a serious problem. It's missing at least 6 inches of width in the back and the lapel portion is shorted fabric. The lapel from the tip of the shoulder to the center front is only about 3 inches wide. From the tip of my shoulder in the lapel which should hang center chest instead stopped at the armpit. The garment ships from GB and that's where you have to pay to return it. The cost of the return is more than the garment.
1.0,Though I ordered a Medium they were way to small.
1.0,"I think there are two versions of these socks.  There is a white sport sock version, They are like ...well, white socks!  And a new crappy version. They feel like thin dress socks...except they are white. That is this version.  Awful feel, tossed 'em out."
1.0,"This blouse would be cute, except I ordered my current size, and it is so right around the chest area I cannot even get it on.  Ordering up one size would still be too small."
1.0,Do not buy this product.
1.0,"The shoe seemed ok, but I ordered a 3 and got a 1. So had to return."
1.0,"This hoodie is the thinnest hoodie I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I typically wear a large shirt, and enjoy baggy hoodies, so I ordered an XL.<br />the hoodie is so small, that even when I ordered a size up, I cant even get close to having this thing zip. There is no way that the reviews and product rating for this are legit. This is absolute trash.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague!"
1.0,It’s junk.. amazon start getting some of these vendors especially the covid prevention ones. Bring back your customer service. I tried to reach this vendor. No response
1.0,Original review with photo evidence was deleted.<br />The mask i received was not the mask in the photo.
1.0,For some reason I thought I was getting all of the keychains.<br />1 was sent. Spendy for 1. Will keep but won't reorder.
1.0,water comes right into goggles !!!!!!
1.0,Returning;  one earring damaged.  Post was not attached to stone!!!!
1.0,"I’m not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn’t this. The fabric is super cheap and the fit is weird. The shorts are oddly tight, yet long. Just not flattering at all. I’ll be returning. The picture looks cute and does not match what I received."
1.0,"The quality was lacking from my previous order. For example, the bracelets were out of round and the silver plating was sloppy and scarce.  I should have returned it on a timely basis."
1.0,No lo recibí con los otros artículos  ordene 3 productos recibí 2 pero no estos aritos morados
1.0,I would normally were a xl or xxl so I ordered a xxxl.  I think this looks more like a medium or large. The fabric quality was really poor and wrinkle mess. This item doesn't meet a standard for Amazon.
1.0,I emailed viiviiKay right after I ordered saying that I needed a Large. Viivii Kay said she will mail out a Large and I still got a MEDIUM!!!! I emailed after receiving it and she was totally out. I will never order from her again.
1.0,Feels too tight. It caused me headache. Shipping was too slow. very disappointing. contacting seller for a refund...
1.0,"Cute shirt, but it did not fit me well in the chest area and the tie would undo itself which can be dangerous!"
1.0,Just another cheap product from China don’t buy didn’t come with instructions
1.0,"While the stocking materiel was nice and the stockings barely went on, they were not meant for my size (Woman's plus 22).  These stockings ran like the wind.  No such luck with comfort or dependability like they say.  They seemed to be a well constructed stocking, just not for my body size.  I would return them, but they are ruined."
1.0,Two of the bracelets broke within 2 hours of wearing them.
1.0,"The hat was really cheap and the lettering was printed on and faded. Not stitched. Really cheaply made, kind of disappointed :("
1.0,"Honestly this is the worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon. Horrible fabric with no stretch, bad construction, terrible print quality. I could go on but it would be as much of a waste of time as waiting for this stupid dress to come in the mail. Save yourself some money, do not buy this."
1.0,I know it's hip and cool to have a tighter fitting shirt but this shirt is built for a woman the neckline is very very feminine and it cuts in too much at the waist it looked ridiculous on my son.
1.0,Doesn't fit like it looks in the picture at all. Nor does it look like the picture. Don't buy.
1.0,Poor quality. Looked cheap. Ended up spending more money for a better quality product.
1.0,Cheap replication!
1.0,The picture and the product I received can't be the same. What I got is too thin and cheap looking. Returning!!
1.0,"El vestido viene en tallas muy pequeñas, yo lo compre XL y salió como small"
1.0,The mirror lens looks as if there is a drop in the film covering the lens.
1.0,Don't fot larger breast.
1.0,These were very poorly made. Kept falling off. Not highly recommended. Someone that is into making jewelry can fix it up. I won't buy it again!
1.0,This is not an ankle bracelet.  It's far too large.  This is a necklace.
1.0,Broke the first time I washed it. Hadn't even worn it.
1.0,Didn't care for it. It not what I was looking for.
1.0,I’m<br />Hoping to hear back from the company as I’d like to think this is a fluke and have the boots replaced but after one day of wear the boot separated from the sole. I have a very bummed 8 year old
1.0,"We returned this watch because the face is cloudy especially when you try to read it from the side, as another buyer noted in their review. The seller claimed it was not defective and said we had scratched the watch (not true) and so charged us a 20% restocking fee. We feel cheated."
1.0,"Not at all what picture looks like, very complicated does not fit well,returning."
1.0,"I'm in the process of returning this item because there is a big scratch going down one of the lenses, right down the middle. Also, the arm is loose."
1.0,It looked great at first--great fit & style--but didn't hold up very well. I washed it 2 or 3 times & it looks like I drug it behind a truck. The fabric is obviously cheap.
1.0,"The pants seams were misaligned, and very janky, making the pants feel as though they were not only crooked, but 2 sizes smaller than expected.  I ordered mine a size large, to give myself extra baggyness, and they ended up feeling as tight as skinny jeans."
1.0,The fabric was like felt and the jacket size ran small. Wanted to return but vendor only offered a 10% discount because of the distance to return it.
1.0,You would have to be only 105 lbs to get these on. I ordered EX. They were actually for my husband. Couldn’t get them on his swollen feet.
1.0,If I could go lower I would.
1.0,"I couldn't fix them and my optician wasn't willing to try because the glasses were non-prescription readers.  Were they used?  Bought several Eyekepper readers in the last few months, all in excellent condition.  Too much hassle to return, so I gave them to a local charity to see if they could salvage them.  Very disappointing."
1.0,Very cheap poor thin quality can see thru very disappointed in this quality
1.0,Just not worth the money I paid.
1.0,"Nothing can be 100% cotton AND UPF 5+. that's right, 5 not even 50. Cotton is naturally about UPF 5."
1.0,Garbage broke putting it on
1.0,It’s really thin and you can see through it in the right light. For $10 I kept it but I’ll be wearing a bodysuit under.
1.0,"Not a 6 pack. Only came with 3 buckles. Also, the screws for the eyelets are too short."
1.0,A medium would fit a 12 year old child.  I used the measurements provided on the listing.  Not accurate
1.0,These smelled awful when I opened the package. They have a really strong chemical smell that wouldn't wash off. Need to return.
1.0,The ring came in damaged
1.0,Ran for about 5 minutes then died.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,Not worth getting. Item was falling apart before I could put it on.
1.0,DID NOT RECEIVE THESE RECEIVED TOTALLY DIFFERENT SUNGLASSES.
1.0,I got the wrong shirt in the mail and it wouldn't even fit a barbie doll!
1.0,"I wouldn't buy these if I were you, these are very fragile and it's next to impossible to even open these!"
1.0,Fit isn’t what I expected<br />Not the shade of BLUSH I expected
1.0,"Received this just now in the mail and very disappointed since the clothes are defective and it has stains all over the clothes, ordered the clothes so my baby can wear for an occasion but now this has disappointed me since I have to find a replacement on time now, very mad!"
1.0,"I had such high hopes for this ear cuff. It is really beautiful but sadly, doesn't fit on either my or my daughter's ear. You would need to use a plyer's to bend it out of shape (defeating the purpose/look) in order to get this to fit. It is ergonomically impossible to make this fit your ear and I wish they would have tried it out before selling to  unsuspecting customers."
1.0,"Product said for Samsung gear 2, but when I got it, it did not fit the watch."
1.0,Arrived split at the seam.
1.0,I am returning these boots because after I used them 3 times the bottom of both heels completely bent and I can not repair them.  This is definitely not the quality I expected.
1.0,"Don’t buy these if you are looking for flare. They are straight leg. I feel stupid,  they are Lee jeans I could have gone to Walmart. My mom wears Lee jeans"
1.0,Not even close to the same color
1.0,The glasses are very big and look big on your face. I tried to change the lens out.<br />Got it off but could not get the lens back on. So I have sun glasses with no lens.
1.0,Clip broke loose after 1 use. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Save your money. It's not plated, it's copper paint over a black band. The black color is painted on and wearing off right out of the box. The copper (claimed as rose gold) is only on the top part and faded in between links as if the metal had been rubbing or never painted. The screwdriver was loose in the box upon receipt and scratched the rose gold paint already as well"
1.0,Top was entirely too small..
1.0,Poor quality and doesn't look as good as it does in the picture!
1.0,"When I first received this cardigan, I loved it. It was thick and kept me warm. I've worn it twice, so I decided to wash it. As I pulled it from the washer, I noticed the entire side had split open. I thought it was something I had done wrong until I noticed several of the ones I purchased from Amazon had split apart. My assumption is the stitching was not done properly. I feel as if I wasted my money and now I have to go on a search for quality products. I am very disappointed."
1.0,"I ordered this shirt in green stripes and loved it so much I ordered the red one.  The red shirt is of a different material, more like a knit.  The wrinkles will not iron out so can only wear around the house.  If you are lucky with your order you may get the softer, flowing type shirt."
1.0,"The fabric is nice but I ordered a large, I usually wear a 14.  These were skin tight and I like my PJs loose.  I felt like the shorts were cutting off my circulation!"
1.0,"Great print, very short in size"
1.0,very tight. looks great though
1.0,"If I could give zero stars I would. This hat arrived in a plastic bag, flat as a pancake. I threw it away."
1.0,Bad. Very small.
1.0,Total and complete rip off!! Material is flimsy and worth about $1.00
1.0,This was a gift that arrived with a broken clasp. Will not buy again.
1.0,Very cheap quality shrunk 1st time I washed it and we never wore again.honestly my girls use as doll cloth now.waste of money. F
1.0,The tassel was very frazzled looking and they fell apart almost immediately.
1.0,I rec'd on June 29 2019 and case hinge broke in less than 2 weeks of use. Very disappointed in quality.
1.0,Cheap flimsy material save ur money!
1.0,"I don't think this dress's quality met my expectations.  Also I dont think the top fit right for anyone with much of anything up top.  I'm short!  and so I never really worry about a dress's length on me, but I thought this was too short even on me.  Did not work, I returned."
1.0,I never would have bought these masks had I known I would not be able to wash them with detergent like other laundry.  Instructions say to put them into distilled water then let dry.  I tried it and they stank.
1.0,"Poorly made, hangs awkwardly. Not recommended."
1.0,Masks are very small. I got adult size for my daughter and they don't cover her nose.
1.0,Ordered larger size but too small. Runs very small
1.0,Returned product! Much too small! Toe box height is very small.
1.0,Bodice design is very uncomfortable and the fit is overcoming.
1.0,I would get sizes two sizes up from what you child where's because they rum to small
1.0,Broke before second use. Will attempt to return
1.0,Did not like returning to thin for my age looks like a slip not for me sorry
1.0,Glue holding clasp to band broke after 2 days of light use.
1.0,Terrible material. Don’t purchase
1.0,Very cheap looking<br />Don’t waste your money!
1.0,"Top way too small, wanted to return but was on vacation and missed the deadline for returning it"
1.0,Took 4 weeks to get it and when it came I was very disappointed. Fits great and is pretty true to size but this fabric is horrible
1.0,It fit well and was really cute but ripped after one wear. On the seam in the middle of the dress right up front. Disappointed.
1.0,"I did not pay attention that this product isn’t just made in China, but IS a Chinese item. All the packaging was in Chinese. The box came damaged. The buckles on the shoes are dangerous looking metal. I wouldn’t be surprised if these are full of toxic material."
1.0,Very flimsy. Sent it back
1.0,Everything was tight and the necklace need more chain to it hope it works with birthday stuff to late to order another one
1.0,"This jacket is super cute.  And that's it.  I just used it in a light rain shower, and I was SOAKED!!!  This is quite possibly the worst product, labeled as garment to keep you dry."
1.0,I don’t know if I got a bad pack but they all had loose thread hanging and the knew area was really thin. Cheaply made definitely didn’t look like the photos
1.0,Did not like the look and feel at all.
1.0,SIZED WAY TOO SMALL
1.0,Poorly made.... Cheap material!
1.0,Didn't like pants they were very short not how they was described at all it said long. And they came in late they said 1 date came in while I was on vacation it was too late to return. 🥺 I'll remember the name of that company want order anything else.
1.0,"I was disappointed in the lack of support, especially the padded inserts. They were supposed to help with lift and support and are just too flimsy to be useful."
1.0,material was super thin and not very stretchy.
1.0,"Cheaply made materials sometimes you really get what you pay for """
1.0,"too small, too thin for the price."
1.0,Turned my wrist green in an hour 😩
1.0,They look nice but uncomfortable and heavy and when the 2 last thing go together in my opinion it is not worth buying. I rather pay more for something that is going to be more comfortable that is not made of some cheap material. I don't recommend this product.
1.0,Children’s tights.
1.0,Damn thing broke within a week. It's cute but it's way too think!
1.0,Doesnt fit and cheap material.  Trust me I am arabic
1.0,It took several months to get to me and The chain broke the day I got it ;(
1.0,Rusts up way too fast!!!! Then it starts to smell!!!
1.0,"This shirt is cut weird, and even ordering mult sizes larger than I needed it does fit the upper part of my arms when it’s huge everywhere else. Because it came from China it’s not worth returning. So a waste."
1.0,"This outfit was horrible! The shirt is so wide and short, and the straps for the shorts have no hole for the buttons. One strap has two holes and one has none. Then on the shorts they wrote a 8 over the 9 so it says 80 instead of 90.. Not acceptable!"
1.0,Sad the chain was missing. I will be returning.
1.0,Dosen't cover classes and sticks way off your faces
1.0,Can’t get it to work
1.0,Too big kind of Gawdy
1.0,es un engaño!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.... la tela de la blusa en parte no es igual a lo que se muestra en la foto de publicidad...horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,"I decided to return this instantly after I opened it. The material was not what I expected. It was stretchy, similar to gym clothes.. if that even makes sense!"
1.0,I’m a 10 and got a large and they didn’t fit... also extremely see through!!! They are much much smaller!!!!
1.0,"Mask was as described and would have just right, however first time mask was received it was broken in half (mailed in a postal envelope) Mask was sent back postage paid, however replacement mask was again received broken in half. Same method of mailing. Mask was sent back postage paid. and a refund was issued."
1.0,Nothing like description.
1.0,"It was all bent and cracked when it arrived, and the black draping was a then stocking like material. I could have got better at a dollar store."
1.0,"Poor fit, bad odor."
1.0,"Arrive with a hole in the waist seam.  I decided I would just wear it around the house and within an hour of doing nothing but sitting at my laptop, another hole developed.  Don't dare put it in the washing machine, so it will end up in the garbage."
1.0,Not quality work at all
1.0,"Loved the look of this however the 2xl was barely an XL. My daughter in law got a great looking hoodie, I however am still shopping!"
1.0,"Within a week of getting this ring, one of the small jewels came out. By week two, the silver was rubbing off and exposing the metal underneath. Don’t waste your money on this product, spend a bit more and get a produce that will last. Very disappointing."
1.0,Glasses stayed the same shade of color no matter the amount of sun.
1.0,"No. I was not expecting much, I really wasn't but these were terrible. The 'gems' were all half falling off and glued on really bad. The backings were so bent I couldnt even stick the posts through."
1.0,got my belt nice but no buckle...
1.0,Looks great in the picture and got almost four stars but I was so dissaponted with the very poor material. It is too thin like a camisole.
1.0,The wallet looks great....except it has several LARGE cuts on the front that expose the padding underneath.  They're clean cuts that look like they came from a box cutter.  I'm returning it immediately for a refund.
1.0,"The bag was pretty to look at, the inside is made very cheaply but the smell of the bag both inside and outside was to much. They were nice enough to place a bag of potpourri inside to try and damper the smell which didn't work. I have my bag in the closet so I can try to air it out and hopefully get to use it at some point."
1.0,It's sucks
1.0,Steamed it to &#34;shape&#34; and it will not hold. Looks fairly frumpy. Ended up finding what I wanted elsewhere.
1.0,"Nothing close to looking as seen on image very cheap material, something I could have found at a dollar store, very disappointed."
1.0,"Me queda pequeño, muy pequeño aún siendo un top corto...calidad de la tela más o menos. Realmente esperaba más."
1.0,The material feels like a potato sack.
1.0,"Wish I could of given this dress 0 stars. What I received was nothing like the picture. The color was NOT the same, and the style was nothing like what is shown. So disappointed as I was looking for another summer dress, this looked really cute, could dress it up in many ways with jewelry, etc. The pleating was god awful. Don't buy."
1.0,I really like this but after a day the ball fell off and the threads are stripped. Nice design thou.
1.0,Absolutely horrible. The sapphire is sideways not even in the right direction!!!!
1.0,The springs fell out of the links when I tried removing one to adjust the band. Not worth the money.
1.0,Athletic socks that wear out after just a few wears. Don't waste your money on these for athletic socks. Very cheaply made.
1.0,They are not the ones in the stores. They are so thin I can see my husbands freckles!!!
1.0,The size is for a child not an adult  Ordered xtra large and it looks like a child’s small
1.0,China size.
1.0,I ordered a xl and they  did not come past my ankle.  Obviously this in not US sizes.
1.0,Way to small. I couldn't fit I the pants or anything and I ordered a 3xl. Pathetic.
1.0,I did not receive this bathing suit. The one I received is a bikini not tank style
1.0,I don't know who in their right mind would pay for this and give it a good review this watch is horrible
1.0,the earrings are very heavy and they make my ear lobe hang. I'm hoping someone in my family can use them.
1.0,Shirts were terrible. Made from such poor quality material that they're not even good for working out in. They are a poor fit and too tight right the wasteline and not flattering. The show ever fat curve. Don't waste your money!
1.0,I would send them back but it isn't even worth it. I received the earrings and the stones were poorly placed you can see the metal in the back. I just threw them away.
1.0,Item arrived completely tarnished! Was not silver as pictured online.
1.0,"Rough texture.  Have not worn, but seems to be the kind of sock that stretches out quickly and does not stay put.  Low quality."
1.0,don't Pay 14.99 EXTRA for 2 little pieces extra of wood and a NICE package!....this glasses are EXACTLY the same as the ones i paid 9.99 (the difference are the &#34;zebra wood&#34; ...and the package. here's the LINK :https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1VHZZS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
1.0,"One big tassel, not separated into 4 tiers - looks nothing like the photograph."
1.0,"Light weight,  but too small. They have cone look on your face.  Move when you talk !! Unisex to small for men"
1.0,only good for one shirt.  quite useless
1.0,"I'm 5'9"" and 140#.  According to the size chart, the L should have fit.  These stockings are too small for anyone over 5'1"".  Total waste of money due to a bogus size chart."
1.0,Initially loved these pants. Bought navy in September. Now found that the elastic in the material is breaking down. Can no longer wear them after three months.
1.0,"too short, looked like shirt. Didn't like at all"
1.0,Very difficult to get mask straps through. When it finally gets through it's very difficult to adjust
1.0,These don't stay on my child's foot. Very cute little shoe but I'm disappointed.
1.0,"Too thin so don’t stay put even with the rubber. Love the last ones I got, grey & white although they don’t last long as the toes are too thin.but love them while they last..."
1.0,"These were a horrible disappointment, I looked ridiculous wearing them. You cant talk, they dont fit right. Not worth the money at all. I wish I could return them"
1.0,Lasted one month before breaking apart.  Piece of junk.
1.0,Don't buy this dress unless your SMALL
1.0,it is not as cute as it looks it does not lie nicely on my neck it stick up like a gun
1.0,Crappy and cheap material. Probably fits a child perfectly. I was so excited for it. Wore it once and it gained a hole in it only after a less than 20 minute use.
1.0,No cheap material
1.0,Broke after less then a month of occasional wear. 😒
1.0,"Garbage, they didn’t work at all and were made like Halloween costume quality"
1.0,Do not buy these Apple Watch bands. The colors are not as bright as photos and they are cheap quality. Broke with in seconds of me taking them out of the package and do not stay clipped when wear them. Multiple times my watch fell off when I was near water. Very disappointed. Would not recommend
1.0,I’m a 1X/2X and got a XXL and it is way too small. Sizing not right
1.0,Cheaply made. Fell apart within a week.
1.0,Bag was torn after one wash!
1.0,The T-shirt came with a big hole in at the seams.
1.0,"What arrived doesn't look like what is in the picture at all.  The colors are dark and the cheap plastic ""stones"" are glued on haphazardly.  Only good for a kids costume jewelry."
1.0,Led lights were broken<br />Seems unglued
1.0,Clasps did not work. Metal very thin
1.0,It is suppose to round your breast but it makes them pointy. didn't like that part. but good quality.
1.0,"Very poor quailty shoes , insoles already coming out and haven't worn them yet just received them do not waste your money"
1.0,"The belt is attractive, appears to be of good quality, but the locking mechanism does not work. Therefore the item is essentially worthless..."
1.0,"Size listing very confusing. Size chart lists XL as 34 (in inches). lt came in as 40-42. Listing should be in waist measurement, not S,M,L,XL, XXL..."
1.0,I really loved the way the nose ring looked on me. It is not bendable so it could not stay on my nose. Both rings slipped off my body is.
1.0,This lei does not blink. It has no lights. False advertising.
1.0,It broke instantaneously.  Waste of money
1.0,Horrible broke  broke in one day.. cheep product
1.0,Product received was not as described. I tried to contact the seller but received a notification that they could no longer be reached.
1.0,Looks very cheap. Sewn crooked
1.0,"thin material, ripped at work. very embarrassing. they weren't even old."
1.0,Isn’t looking small but real large
1.0,Does not keep time well. My husband keeps having to reset it.
1.0,"The ONLY ring that looked half way decent was the bow. The rest look horrible, you can't even distinguish what they are."
1.0,"Fits if you are as wide as you are tall, terrible fabric, uncomfortable as hell"
1.0,It broke and there is no way to fix it and it is a waste of money
1.0,I only received 10 instead of 40. Only 6 out of the 10 worked. However I did recieve a refund.
1.0,Very disappointed fabric was real thin it had to holes on it on the seam<br />I could not wear it to my event
1.0,"The cost was good. I have another umbrella that is the same size from a large hardware retailer that was twice the cost. However, that umbrella is working great several months later. This one didn’t last 24 hours before a very mild gust of wind caused the ends of two of the spokes to rip. Very poorly made."
1.0,"Very breakable, not flexible and hurt my ear. Sorry, it's a no-go."
1.0,"This came up when I put Legandary so thought that was what I was getting, material is stiff not comfortable and way to long and to tight on my legs, will be returning this item"
1.0,Would give less start...This is NOT Waterproof!!! I am the fool who didn’t read reviews hopefully someone else will.  The  5 star rating has to be fake!  Looked nothing like the picture except for flower.  Not crisp and not soft floral that the image looks like but blurry bright pink. I also only purchased for the waterproof.
1.0,Wore once<br />Washed once<br />Already has a hole.
1.0,Poor description on size
1.0,"Very nice but very cheap,the top black piece came off the stainless steel."
1.0,Great shirt if you plan on not washing them.
1.0,"You get what you pay for. Well, these items look and feel cheaper than what I paid for. I bought this for my boyfriend for a party but we ended up didn't use the fedora and the sunglasses.  The only thing we ended up using was the suspenders.  The fedora is shapeless and super cheap looking.  It looks nothing like in the picture.  Sunglasses still in the package.  Do not buy!!"
1.0,"This product appears to be a heather grey loose-fitting sweatshirt. I received a solid-color light blue long-sleeve t-shirt. Though the description says it’s a hoodie, I could tell before buying that it wasn’t. I normally wear a L or XL and ordered a 2XL because I wanted this to be a really oversized sweatshirt to wear around the house. This 2X doesn’t even fit at all. It’s way too tight. Based on the photo and description, it should be loose-fitting in my normal size. I can’t even wear it in a much larger size. So disappointed and, needless to say, I will be returning this."
1.0,"This was so small, I couldnt believe when I saw my delivery first time."
1.0,I wore this twice and it's already broken. The clips are fine but the strands that hold the sweater together are crappy plastic chains similar to kids jewelry you get out of a gumball machine. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"the holes are too big for my 15 yr old Yakima bike rack. had to return them and got these other straps from amazon instead which are a perfect fit! : Bike Rack Strap, Bike Wheel Stabilizer Straps, Replacement Rubber Straps Accessory Strap Kit, Adjustable, Bicycle Wheel Stabilizer Straps 4 Pack. These other straps are sturdier, and fit securely on my rack."
1.0,These are NOT cotton or cashmere or &#34;cashmere cotton&#34; (whatever that is).  These are standard chinese-made polyester fleece.  Deceptive description; DO NOT BUY.
1.0,"Band is at least 2"" shorter than original Fitbit band. Feels cheap and barely fits my wrist."
1.0,"30 days after my order, I finally received this necklace in the mail, and it was broken, not at all worth the wait and price."
1.0,"I can tell just from the picture that this is DEFINITALLY FAKE Malachite!! Malachite is an expensive stone, and would NEVER be sold this cheap.. Also, doesn't it just look like layers of plastic?? It may not be made from plastic, but it give your the idea of how they could make this. Real malachite is a beautiful swirl of the same colors, but not block layers like shown. I am a avid crystal collector and I can tell real from fake, even in a picture..<br />ALSO, if you didn't know, Opalite is a man-made stone as well. It is NOT Opal. It is man-made, but I still like Opalite, but I know that it is not natural...But them being sold together just makes another case for the Malachite to be fake.<br />I'm writing this because so many inexperience people buy fake malachite and don't even realize it.  Please do your research...AT THE VERY LEAST, GOOGLE ""MALACHITE"" and see the differences. Speaking of that, google ""real vs. fake malachite"" and you will see what I am saying...anyway, I just wanted to pop in and say this!"
1.0,"No lo recomiendo, se abre constantemente, en dos ocasiones se abrió por completo que cayó al suelo mi Apple Watch ."
1.0,Very skimpy for price
1.0,"PESIMA CALIDAD DE LAS GAFAS, SE SALIO EL RECUBRIENTO Y SE RAYARON A LOS POCOS DIAS DE USO, NUNCA MAS VUELVO A COMPRAR ESTE PRODUCTO."
1.0,Don’t do it!!!!!
1.0,The bottom of the sandle is coming apart after wearing one time.
1.0,Nice shirt but the material is not good.
1.0,I ordered xxl and it is just too small in the cups
1.0,"No lining and totally see through. I do not recommend them. Size up, runs very small."
1.0,Necklace quality is poor
1.0,"Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; item.  Looks cheap, which it was.  Worked only one day, then didn't keep time. I should have known better than to expect more, but when the product description stated the movement was made by a Seiko subsidiary, I thought it would be a good value."
1.0,"I only used it for a couple days and always kept it in the case it came with when not in use and even so one of the lenses was immediately scratched. I am a very careful owner and while the sunglasses looked good, a tad large but looked good none the less, the prone to scratching made it not worth keeping."
1.0,This is junk.  Shipped from China.  Very thin
1.0,Product very cheap
1.0,"Seams did not match or line up, cheaply made"
1.0,"I loved this watch it's beautiful and subtle and for the week that it worked I was really happy. It stopped a few times in the middle of the week but once I reset the time it started up no problem but now it seems like it's permanently done. Don't waste your money, there are plenty of other options on amazon or other places to get a watch."
1.0,WAY too small and the zipper was broken.
1.0,cheap made. really cool but voice changer isn't as good as I expected.
1.0,If your child has a sensory issue with seams this is absolutely Not for your child. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,This is my first bad review ever leaving because I am simply not one to leave them. This dress was just so disappointing. It looks nothing like it does in the picture. It is sleeveless and thin. I ordered it for work but there is no way they will allow a sleeveless dress. What a  waste of 20 dollars
1.0,One of the connector rings fell apart moments after it was removed from the package.
1.0,The pockets on this sweatshirt are too big and cause lots of blue around the midsection.
1.0,Poor quality. Metal is very thin.
1.0,Very small. Made for small kids.
1.0,Se caen las bandas de sujetar. Muy caro para lo que dura se me perdió a la semana
1.0,"Very nice looking watch, but got it wet 1 time and it got water on the inside."
1.0,"EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY SMALL. I PURCHASED TWO PACKS OF THE BRAS W/ DIFFERENT SIZES, BUT YET THEY FIT THE SAME WAY, SMALL. The push-up is on point,  but I can't fit it 😭 ( A & B CUPS ONLY ) !!"
1.0,"I bought this watch a little over a month ago. it does NOT keep accurate time. It has been as much as 12 hours off. It rarely stays on time for more than a day.  It's a lovely watch, but I need to have the right time."
1.0,Zero stars until it gets replaced.
1.0,"I got 3 to 6 months, my daughter is 4 months they were very large . The shoes run large"
1.0,They weren't the correct size. Arrived in 13 days
1.0,"This is a lovely looking mumu and I would love to have it, but I do not see any place to choose a size.  I tried<br />just putting it on my order to see what would happen.  No size anywhere.  Oh, well.  Will just spend my  money<br />elsewhere."
1.0,"I was very excited to receive the socks but noticed something was off as soon as I put them on. It's as if they are two different socks. One sock is laced much tighter than the other and is longer than the other sock; and one of the socks had a small tear.  Plus shipping costs more than the actual socks themselves.<br /><br />There are better fishnet socks out there, won't purchase again."
1.0,"BUYERS BEWARE!!! I purchased this a day ago under the impression that the skull moved like most bars with added jewels! IT DOES NOT! The skull is molded into place. Unless you have HUGE ears, there is no way to put in or remove the bar once it is in place. I was able to put the bar in with a bit of hassle, but it wasn’t terrible until I tried to remove it. Trying to remove the bar ended with me ripping my piercing open and having to BOLT CUT THE BAR OUT!!! It was literally lodged in place, I tried maneuvering my ear around the bar to see if I could remove it from either ends and ripped my piercing. Now I’m left with a bleeding ear, wasted money and tears. 😡😡"
1.0,"The shirt is cute, but one problem, the maps on the back of the shirt are backwards and reversed, so is the wording."
1.0,Broken in the package
1.0,String broke the first week not good.
1.0,"Size X-large is like size small, can barely get the shirt off and on.  The same identical brand and style I ordered previously fit fine in the X-Large, must be defective or miss-labeled"
1.0,Far to tight across the shoulders.  Didn't seem to made proportionately.
1.0,"These were very thin , cheap material and even though I ordered my size by chart they were too small"
1.0,"It it's so cheap and flimsy, it makes an annoying clacking sound and mine even showed up scratched. It's crap, go spend a few bucks more and get something you can actually wear!"
1.0,Material was not what I thought.  Looked t shirt like in photo but was a shiny polyester material.
1.0,"Sizes are more like children sizes, not women's!"
1.0,I really wanted to love this watch. It stopped working after 4 days. My 8 yr old was pretty bummed.
1.0,"Not at all what is pictured. There are no pleats, no shape at all to this and very thin cheap material. Yes it was cheap so not too surprised but should have resembled the picture."
1.0,"Bought this for my teen daughter (size 4), and sized up per recommendations.  It was still snug on her bottom and revealed a side of her, when she walked, that normally doesn't see direct sunlight.  It's a shame, because from the front the suit had good coverage and looked adorable on her."
1.0,"The product itself is nice, flattering fit. However it isn't the top that I ordered and it took forever to get here. I ordered the top pictured but ended up receiving one with mesh details."
1.0,"Sizing is off. Ordered a large thinking that as a sweatshirt it would fit comfortably. No way, this is fitted. So disappointed."
1.0,Picked these up for travel.  Turns out that they cannot be used under TSA rules.  Waste of money.
1.0,"I used this wallet for ~6 months and the card retainers inside broke on the end, so now when you open it the cards will fall out when you tilt it at all. Contacted seller and got a runaround that they couldn't help. They said I would have to contact the manufacturer directly. I asked for clarification (I purchased it from the &#34;Shark&#34; seller) and they said they could help if I could provide the receipt and warranty card. I could not find the warranty card and am out of luck. Terrible service considering I purchased it on amazon and have proof of sale and time. Do Not Recommend."
1.0,Less than a month of carrying this bag and the cross over strap broke.  Very poor quality. DISAPPOINTED.
1.0,"The dresses are adorable, but the material is horrible. The yellow dress was torn in several areas of the arms and waist. Thankfully I am very good at sewing, and since  Im a very busy woman I chose to just sew the torn areas myself rather than going through the hassle of returning it and waiting for a replacement."
1.0,Very good quality material and very soft. Problem was it didn’t come with a battery charger and I have know idea where to find one. Then I tried to return it and they weren’t accepting my return because it was over fifteen days. I really feel I was scammed.<br /><br />Sad Buyer
1.0,"While the material is very good quality, it is held together by very poor quality zippers. They lasted 8 days of use at school. Not roughly handled, just zipped and unzipped for loading in a lunchbox and couple books. Return window closed so I am forced to find a repair shop to replace the zippers with good quality ones. Buyer be aware!"
1.0,Original order would not run at all. Replacement would run but the stem was stuck. Could not adjust time or date.
1.0,"I'm 5'8&#34;, and this was way too short for me."
1.0,"I'm size 32 and I ordered a 32 and it feels like i got a 34 plus it's so long. I'm a 32-30 and this pants or not for me men I have to say,  THEY ARE TRASH IN SIZING!"
1.0,The material is too thick. It feels like curtain fabric.
1.0,"These headbands are cheap, thin, and not well stitched nor structurally sound.  I use a lot of headbands since I sweat like a horse, so increasing the number available at an affordable price makes buying something like these a necessary evil.  I don't recommend them highly, but they do basically work if you are willing to wring them out a couple times an hour, since they don't hold a lot of sweat.  For the price, they are barely adequate.  They have an unpleasant habit of twisting partially inside-out in the wash in such a way that it takes several minutes of pulling and smoothing one to get it to lie flat again, with the stitching on the inside where it belongs instead of at the top or the bottom or corkscrewed around from top to bottom.  I don't think I'll buy them again, but they aren't quite disfunctional to send back.<br /><br />Update: They've started to fall apart after a couple of washes.  See picture.  I would never buy these again & wish I hadn't bought this set."
1.0,Cute top for the price. Not too thin or thick. Fits true to size
1.0,Hate I threw away box before inspecting shoes would hv sent these back immediately.
1.0,The tassel just broke all the thread came off unraveled  I will send it back or you can send a replacement
1.0,"I wear a size 8, but cannot wear these. Very disappointed, luckily, my daughter could use them."
1.0,"Since the boots are discontinued @ the store, I purchased here since my husband perfer these boots. Even though they were more here I decided to buy. But less than 6 months, the boots are coming apart @ the seam. Too much money & boots not worth it."
1.0,Way to big and fabric was heavy.
1.0,I ordered three colors in the same sock and size. The blue fits smaller than the other two. Strange
1.0,Band broke within a week
1.0,"Why market to sell a product and not make it to how it should look? Where do I begin. Flimsy material, fit not even close to a medium, symmetry is so off. The person who sewed this must be vision impaired or truly gave zero f's because there is no way you could sit at a sewing machine and piecemeal this together and not see that the patterns are misaligned and not what's in the picture. Too small, too short, pattern way off the mark and made with cheap material They didn't even try! Not happening with my money...not today! Additionally, the color in the picture appears to be more red but it's closer to orange than red. Sending this right back!"
1.0,"Sizing was very off. Very large and too much fabric on top and super tight by the waist. I tried to return but the seller instead offered a new one, which I didn't want and it never came."
1.0,Way to small.  Look else where.  The 4-10 year olds are more like 1-2 year size. Very disappointed.
1.0,Es muy diferente al de la foto ya que esta muy corto me quedo arriba de la pierna y en la foto esta para abajo de la pierna
1.0,So incredibly think wrinkled material. Had to return.
1.0,Very cheap looking and the tassels were all bent.
1.0,Style and material were not what I envisioned
1.0,Didn’t like the fabric it’s like a nylon and it will shred easily
1.0,"This dress looks nothing like the picture. It looks more like a camisole or a lingerie (see attached pic). I would never wear this out in public. To add to it, it came way later than expected. I have Amazon prime and the estimated delivery date is no where near the arrival date. I planned to wear it for my anniversary dinner, which obviously didn't happen. This item cannot be returned through Khol's. If u want to return it u need to coordinate with the seller, whatever that means. So buyers beware!"
1.0,Not what is pictured! The pants length is calf hight! Added I bought an XL and it was more like an XS. I’m 5 8 1/2. I 65 lbs. I usually wear a sz 12 or a large. I like my slacks/pants fitting a bit loose. This was no way near my size!<br />The fabric was also very cheap! This company should be ashamed for false advertising! Don’t by this garment. Waste of time and money.
1.0,...Could not even take my pee pee outta my pants or leak fluid outta my booty hole...
1.0,"I ordered a size 14, and it's really like a size 6.  What a waste of money."
1.0,very poor quality. wore one time on most of the tassels tore and pulled out.
1.0,Very cheap and ill fitting
1.0,"Extremely poor quality, you're better off using a zip-lock bag then this thing. I threw mine away the same day it arrived."
1.0,"Quality was good.  But sizing was not accurate.  I ordered 2 sizes larger, but still too small.  Returned item."
1.0,Bracelet started to fall apart within a few weeks
1.0,This does not look anything like the pictures shown. It runs very large (I ordered a small) & the twist in the front looks very sloppy.
1.0,"The shirt fit everywhere, except the sleeves. They were so short, I almost thought I purchased a baseball (3/4 sleeve) tee."
1.0,I didn’t care for the weight of these ear rings.
1.0,"This watch came apart on my wrist....it is held together with, what looks like, ordinary fishing line.  It fell to the floor in town, while I was shopping.  So sorry, I really liked it."
1.0,Did not fit and was made very poorly
1.0,I received one earring now please tell me how I can make that work I really needed to wear it on the day I expected it and only one freaking earring😩
1.0,Item arrived very different than pictured.
1.0,Not flattering at all. Returned.
1.0,"I've used FitBest carburetors before and have had no trouble. This one, however, is junk. It's from China...need I say more? The unit leaks out the vent hole and the throttle does not cause any changes to the engine speed. Wide open throttle no matter what. The previous version of this carburetor, that also came from FitBest/China and was installed last summer, has a broken float pin mount. This is why I am replacing the carb with a new one. The fuel solenoid also failed on the 1st one. I am currently in the process of trying to clean out the Mikuni I replaced with the 1st FitBest and am going to use parts off of the 1st FB to rebuild the Mikuni and hope to get my mower up again.<br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CARBURETOR FOR ANY REASON!!!<br />I do recommend FitBest as a seller. I have never had an issue with ANY other carburetor I've gotten from them. It is just this model."
1.0,"Becomes spontaneously unzipped!  I wear A42C and ordered the XL. The fit was fine, the material was comfortable but I did struggle to zip-up the bra. After I did it once it got easier and so I wore the bra in public.<br /><br />It was during a grocery store run, when I was in the check out line with people behind and in front of me, that the bra first decided to unzip itself.  That was awkward. I thought well maybe, since I had gotten the 3 pack, I should try another color. Unfortunately, all the other colors would become spontaneously unzipped during wear. And it wasn't doing anything weird like a back bend.  I was just hiking, dancing and weightlifting, grocery shopping. I returned them"
1.0,This was a mess.  Do not buy. The fit is way off and it's a waste of money.  I tried to send it back  but the buyer would not return all my money.  He offered on to return 30% of what I paid.  Ripoff!
1.0,The band sucks. It pops off when its touched. I have a small wrist and the band is one notch away from being too big. The metal is changing colors and reacting with my skin.
1.0,The plastic cover is very marred and scratched.  It seems to work ok but is not as quiet as I hoped it would be and I'm very disappointed in the condition.
1.0,This is unusable. Doesn’t look at all like the pic. Sending it back immediately
1.0,"The length is so short you can barely take them off your head, would definitely not purchase again"
1.0,"These are supposed to 3x boxers, that means they should be made for a big man.  Well they fit my boyfriend like little boy boxers. they were about 2 inches long. They were horrible for him.  He threw 2 of them out.<br /><br />My advice: DONT GET THESE FOR A BIG, TAL MAN THEY'LL MMAKE U FEEL LIKE A GIANT!"
1.0,These are awkward and I sent them back. They leave a weird line down your boob when they are on.
1.0,Its smalll)l had to return and pay 15 dollars for shipping
1.0,"Return watch, the display was very light and unable to read without using the light mode."
1.0,"STAY AWAY Update 4/2018. I didn't think it possible, but science has increased to the point where, well we split atoms? Right? Well now they've managed to SPLIT THE LEATHER ATOM. Now for a mere 32 dollars you can own you very own ONE MOLECULE THICK LEATHER FANNYPACK. Please don't place anything in the pack that might be pointy or hard, say a tissue or piece of paper, it will rapidly tear through the one molecule of leather this junk bag is made of. The seller won't even stand behind this product, told me to contact the manufacturer, yeah good luck with that, like they might care about a single buyer, HA HA HA. So sorry to tell you, the old one I have from about 8 years ago, that was great, this current paper thin one, absolute waste of money. Please look elsewhere. I think I'm going to bite the bullet and have one custom made with real leather, not the &#34;black leather paper&#34; this one is made from<br /><br />Let me say I've been wearing fanny packs for over 15 years, so I'm kind of an &#34;expert&#34;. This is, hands down, the most durable, functional and well thought out pack. Holds a ton of items very neatly. It's a little large but is made of great quality leather. I wear mine about 16 hours a day, working on cars, sitting, bending and it's perfect.<br />Other cheap flea market ones fall apart in months, these last years and I'm very hard on mine.<br />They start looking beat up after about 2-3 years constant use, but that is excellent life for the price<br /><br />Excellent product"
1.0,"Stitches are coming apart, thread hanging all over...waste of money"
1.0,The quality of the printed wings is poor.
1.0,I purchased this product due to it's uniqueness. The lanyard fell apart upon first use. I Lost main bead so I could not put it together.  Not very happy.  On a lighter note the gift box packaging was nice.
1.0,"The description for this product says waterproof but it most definitely is not. I tested it before I took it out on a rainy bike ride by pouring a half cup of water onto it and letting it set a bit. In less than 20 seconds it started to pour through.<br />  It would probably make a decent windbreaker. It's very bright and has a reflective section on the lower back. As far as sizing goes: I wear a size 40 jacket. I ordered  a 2XL to allow for the small sizing of this product. It fit me about right.<br />  Still, waterproof is waterproof and this isn't. Return."
1.0,"This sweater swallowed me up and looked ridiculous on. The interior portion of the pockets protruded, making them visible through the opening in the front. The bat wings made for lots of extra fabric between my arms and body, creating unwanted bulk. There was nothing redeeming about this sweater so I returned it."
1.0,Very short very small even for 2x
1.0,This is trash! Not what was advertised! Really pissed off because I’m getting married tomorrow and you messed up this order!! Ridiculous!
1.0,not the same as the picture at all.
1.0,XX small gave it to my friends eight year Old.
1.0,Necklace was broken when I got it. Would not purchase again!!
1.0,Really short but fits perfectly
1.0,So dissappointed. Beautiful design but the metal is so thin and cheap looking I won't wear it.
1.0,Returning because its more like a medium than an XL
1.0,Not OEM made from cheap plastic.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY. Broke within the first HOUR of using. Listen to the other reviews, do not waste your money. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,Great watch for my 9 yr old until the face plate broke and wouldn’t snap back on.
1.0,Horrible fit. Returned them. Seller charged 20% to return. Beware!!!
1.0,I couldn't even figure out how to put them on.
1.0,I sent this shirt back. Cute style but hated the fabric
1.0,Outfit was not based on the size chart provided. Otherwise super cute outfit wish the size chart was correct.
1.0,The cotton is of poor quality
1.0,Nothing like in the picture the black trim doesn’t look anything like the picture. The XL is extreamly small and uncomfortable. The lace looks like shoe string. It’s not a long at all it short I would say shorter than a normal T-shirt. Honestly I would rather return and get a refund.
1.0,Aveces no funciona material muy simple mal diseñado por que se escapa el aire que haría que suene
1.0,Hat was supposed to be for my 3 month old. Didn’t fit him it fit for an adult
1.0,Fell apart without even using.
1.0,"This is a horrible, offensive product. It should be removed."
1.0,"The description clearly says &#34;Stainless Steel&#34;. I got these for my gf thinking they would be safe for her ( she is allergic to that silver paint the use on most fake/costume /fantasy jewelry). Boy was I wrong. She put them on and they really looked nice on her. A couple of hours later she got that skin allergy. I polished the with Mother's Mag and Aluminum polish to see what was going on (the polish when used on fake jewelry it will take away the silver paint and reveal the copper or whatever metal there is underneath; if it is truly silver or stainless steel it will not change color, it will polish it to a high shine). And what do you know, it's just copper painted silver. I hate when they advertise something as &#34;stainless steel&#34; and it just turns out to be painted copper. I contacted costumer service but they just kept saying that it's truly stainless steel. I even took pictures and they just kept (like we say here at home) falling on their behinds and saying that there is nothing wrong with the product. After messaging back and forth they never answered back. I never got a refund or a solution to this. I have never been so angry and disappointed with any purchase and bad customer service until I purchased this piece of junk."
1.0,The fabric on the sleeves and bottom of the shirt are not hemmed so the shirt is constantly fraying.<br /><br />The necklace is plastic. It came with the paint all scratched up.
1.0,Fit too short returned
1.0,This item was so expensive and it lasted two days. I do not recommend it
1.0,"Not entirely sure these are actually a Hanes product. Listed as all cotton, but some were polyester mix. Also, didn’t feel like cotton. Also, the leg holes weren’t quite right somehow. The rest of the panty seemed sized ok, but the leg holes just didn’t fit."
1.0,"Seam directly down the front of the shirt, way too small even in the largest size and fabric is itchy."
1.0,Definitely not one size fits all if you are a little more booby in the chest like I am.<br />Material was thin and felt like a cheap Halloween costume.<br />I bought 2 of these (one as a gift) and thank god I got mine in first. I would've been embarrassed to give this away.
1.0,No es de buen material se cambio de color cin solo dos puestas
1.0,Material is VERY thin and size runs small. The dress did not look as nice as the picture makes it appear.
1.0,picture and description is deceiving.  no happy with product.
1.0,Material is nothing like what was described. The material is pretty cheap looking. Do not waste your money.
1.0,The ring broke after a small adjustment.
1.0,Cheap quality and misfit ....
1.0,"UPDATE!! (Feb 2023) Hate to say this, but this set is AWFUL. Do. NOT. Buy!! Made like pure junk. Snags on anything g and everything. Runs and pulls so easily. Had an actual HOLE in it only hours after putting it on!! It is woven so loosely and pulls for no reason. Ugh. Hate to return it but will NOT have a set that is ruined hours after putting it on (& I was rising in the car and walking onto a ship)<br /><br />I love the set. It’s super cute and fits well. It also does not stretch out when you wear it. make sure that you are OK with a crop top. The pants do come up high enough that you can wear the outfit without anyone even realizing it’s a crop top. I would buy this in another color or maybe two"
1.0,"Cheap fabrics!!! DONT BUY IT!!!!<br />Tela súper cheap, calurosa y fea!!! Así sea barato, no vale la pena!!!!!!"
1.0,"I wanted to love this dress.  The description made it sound like it would be super comfortable and made with quality.  I was so disappointed that was not the case. The dress is uneven, the elastic around the waist is itchy and scratchy, but most of all the material is not &#34;high quality&#34;"
1.0,Returned.  It didn't have a button hole and it def was not the same sweater from photo
1.0,The sequins fall off quickly. Looks nothing like the photo. It really is just awful.
1.0,Very poor quality both headband are coming apart I am very disappointed
1.0,This item is not at all as shown on line it’s so cheap looking.  It looks as if it came from cracker box
1.0,It was broke :(
1.0,Very disappointed...... gold tone was already off on the earrings. I had to buy tarnish liquid to brighten.<br />They looked used as well. The stoned were nice.
1.0,"I purchased these sweat shirts for my wife. She loved them until she washed them. Similar to other clothing items purchased with this brand, the clothing was incredibly pilled when she pulled them from the wash. Drying the clothing item did not help remove any pilling. She was very upset and feels as thought the purchases should be refunded."
1.0,Metal was splitting on most earrings. Kind of heavy too
1.0,I initially loved this top even though it was much bigger than I expected.  It looks terrible after just one washing.  It does not hold up and I don't want to wear it.  I will wear it around the house or to sleep in...
1.0,After two days the buckle came apart.
1.0,I ordered a medium and they were way too small!!!
1.0,Fits bigger than. Size suggestion. Material is not quality.
1.0,Very hard.  Not comfortable
1.0,The. Fit awful nothing like pictures
1.0,"Crap for what I wanted. UPS driver,had skin cancer removed from left arm previously so wanted something more than sunscreen. Female so the small size was correct and long enough, bought the light gray color.  It does not hold up under heavy duty use the seam by the wrist shredded and frayed the first day, had to keep pulling wrist area down it kept riding up, hot-hot-hot, stained easily after one use, hand washed and could not get the stains out.  If your just doing some light duty gardening maybe, but for anything other would not waste $$$.  As far as shipping it was fast, and I did not attempt to contact vendor or return so I can not make any bad remarks towards vendor."
1.0,Not at all like the picture like not at all like the picture
1.0,Sizing and measurements are off. Sizing chart was not accurate. I ordered one size up since it’s China made and I assumed it would be incorrect. It was still too small. Material is flimsy thin with no lining. May not work for those with sensitive skin or want a better quality dress. Definitely overpriced for what it is. Returning this one.
1.0,"It’s a great ideas, but if you have a tummy or bck fat it’s rolls. I don’t think it’s wide enough for the length I have a longer torso than most people"
1.0,"No sirven,tardaron para llegar, parece q son para niño y las costuras no sirven."
1.0,"Clearly the zipper is NOT WATERPROOF. I was really hoping this bag would work due to size and ability to carry it several ways.<br /><br />The first bag was the same, this second bag (ther replacement) is the same. I took several photos and tested the bags.<br /><br />First, the bag would leak air under pressure when I put my hand on it. It leaked where the zipper stopped when zipped up. You could move the zipper around and hear the air hissing at different amounts like it would seal a little tighter and then a little less as more air would leak.<br /><br />Second test was putting the bag in the shower with a light stream of water all over the bag. When water gets near the zipper it will leak into the bag. See the photos and the wet paper towel inside the bag.<br />I also tried adding some waterproof silicone zipper grease to see if that would help, it didn't.<br /><br />This bag would work if the ground was wet or if the bottom was sitting on wet area. Most waterproof zippers in other gear I have or have seen has a rubber stopper where the zipper ends, allowing the zipper to make a sealed connection. I took a photo for reference. If this bag had something like that it would have been waterproof.<br /><br />I tried this bag due to the cost, a bag that could handle getting rained on, and wanting a zippered waterproof bag in this size, however I'll need something else.<br /><br />Hope this review helps you in your search."
1.0,Jacket was nice but the X-Large was more like a medium
1.0,This so called dress is absolutely horrible!!!  I have never tried anything on that was so unflattering.  It fits like a huge cape!  I am not a big person 5ft 3inches 139#.  It made me look twice the my size.  The only thing fitting is the Sleeves.  Total YUK!
1.0,"Loved the style, but not a great not even a good fit. Had to return"
1.0,"The top is too small, had a running thread on the front side plus it had a weird smell."
1.0,Súper I loved
1.0,The product is extremely well made and fits perfect.  HOWEVER the product description says 90% cotton 10% polyester  but it is actually30%rayon 65% Terylene 5% spandex.. ABSOLUTELY no cotton so extremely disappointed. Not a fan of synthetic fiber or FALSE ADVERTISING!
1.0,"I expected something more sturdy! Material is flimsy and the sole is a super thin rubber layer. Didn’t even bother trying the shoe on my daughter, returned it!"
1.0,"This was returned.  It's hilarious, your arms would have to be half their length to use the pockets, nothing like the picture."
1.0,"I thought it would come embroidered and screen printed like the original seeming as it is just as expensive, but it is only printed. Waste of money"
1.0,Bought 10 total only 8 had &#34;pearls&#34; most of which had a thick white paint like cover over which is mearly impossible to remove.<br />Not worth the money guys they are either fake or low quality and very obviously planted into shells as they are not closed when taken out of package- also their resting beside the meat of the oysters rather than in the meat.
1.0,I ordered this necklace for my daughter's first Mother's day. She loved it and wears it all the time.
1.0,Doesn't work like I hoped.
1.0,Rubbish and waste of money. Returned it immediately
1.0,Amazing color but the material is not cotton and make my head itchy and hot
1.0,"Cheaply made, but hey, it was a cheap purchase, but it looks cheap as the plastic stones are not glued in straight."
1.0,"Por favor ponga las medidas de los carros nunca lo dicen y cuando los compro son muy pequeños, muchas gracias"
1.0,This is the Reeboks hat it doesn't have Reeboks on it any were
1.0,Do not buy this shirt if you’re looking for a quality cotton T-shirt. It came in a plastic bag and when I removed the shirt the graphic material was completely stuck to itself; I had to peel the shirt apart. I didn’t realize the shirt was a spandex blend. It felt super cheap and wasn’t even worth trying on.
1.0,"This is not sized correct. The 2x is xlarge maybe large at best. I ordered two pkg 2x, the others fit great these are pretty, but size is off."
1.0,"uncomfortable, uneven"
1.0,Wasn’t what I had expected so I returned item
1.0,Bad quality fabric. Only one wash and it pilled
1.0,The anchor symbols came apart on the laundry.
1.0,FIRST time riding on my SxS with this and threads are coming out everywhere!! Look at the pictures. Straight to the garbage.
1.0,"This was not promoted as a child's mask. But only a child could have worn the pair that was sent to me!  I gave them to my neighbor, but it was a waste of money for me. Also - the fabric was really stiff. If it HAD fit a normal-sized adult human, I wouldn't have used it anyway. Blech."
1.0,spend my money for nothing this watch does not work the screen.
1.0,Was not at all like the picture.
1.0,"It's cute, but super small. More like a lunch bag"
1.0,"This dress is gigantic. It is so long and just too big all around. It arrived inside-out in its package, which I found to be strange. It looks cheap, unlike the picture"
1.0,Started shredding.
1.0,super thin fabric. had to return.
1.0,I ordered 6g. They’re too small. I don’t recommend these.
1.0,Cheap and hella small
1.0,Not color close as shown
1.0,I received the wrong product and had to return it. This was a Christmas gift so I didn't have time to wait for them to ship the correct item. I simply returned it and purchased something else.
1.0,Trash.... had them one week and they broke... defective. They were on my face and snapped on bottom of the lens
1.0,Ugly not worth the money sis.
1.0,Looked great but now I have just a black shirt<br /> Started fading first wash
1.0,"This bra sucks if you're sweaty. I wore this with a dress for a wedding and I didn't even make it to the wedding and it was no longer sticky from sweating. Another note is I am a 34 DD, I got the D from reading other reviews and it did not quite cover the whole breast."
1.0,Received without a clasp and the chain broken in 3 places.  Sent it back for a refund.
1.0,Didn't like the feeling of the leather and the metal creaked. Will be returning.
1.0,"This is a completely different hat than what was pictured. The trim is not furry. It is kind of cute if it were for a little girl, but my sons wanted plain Santa hats without polka dot bows and antlers."
1.0,Muy incomodas
1.0,I don’t like these because the outside looks like waterproof material. The description said cloth so I thought it was just regular cotton not shiny material.
1.0,"This looked like a nice blouse on screen.  But when you have it in your hands, you can see it is totally see through!.  I hate having to wear so many layers but this one needs something underneath.  It fit fine, it's just sheer.  I suppose I can use it in the summer over my exercise shirt.  I don't know, right now it's just chintzy fabric and not what it boasted to be."
1.0,"This item is NOT a high quality bronze, as described. It’s a cheep costume jewelry item that is two toned painted. Nothing like what was pictures. Very disappointed."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:dc0ce14986d17451791734a55c6520d5]] Unknown stain inside of bear packet. Look like someone already used it. It is not brand new for sure. :(
1.0,I wished you could see the inscription on the ring like it should a color choice of the inscription as black on black you can’t see it. But white or a contrast color to black I would have loved this ring but I was disappointed and I won’t wear it 😔
1.0,I could not get the band to fit my watch and the provided tool is useless for the purpose. Don’t waste your money
1.0,I like the headband but the Nike sign has peeled off within 2 washes on regular speed. Would be greatly appreciated if the seller would send a new headband as this is unacceptable quality. Thank you.
1.0,Love the look of this bracelet.  Hate the clasp.  The bracelet constantly falls off my wrist.
1.0,Fell apart as soon as it was removed from the package.
1.0,"These are a really thick awkward material, so if you're wearing anything slightly tighter you're gonna be able to see the weird outline of it from outside your clothes. The adhesive on the inside is extremely strong, which is great, except it's a little too strong and you'll want to take an asprin before attempting to peel it off. I wanted to try these out because I usually use sticky boobs and wanted something different, but I won't be switching over lol. If you don't know what sticky boobs are, search them on amazon and order from whichever seller has over a 4 star product rating. They work really well if you read the instructions. I have a bigger chest as well."
1.0,"All of the French color words were cut off so badly you can't even read them!<br />Also, it seems like some letters were printed facing outwards, while others inwards. Disappointing, as the recipient would have otherwise loved this."
1.0,I am a size medium but after I read the reviews I ordered an X-large. Yet this skirt was to small and  Not only was it to small but it was also very see-through. Save your money This item is not worth it.
1.0,"Item broke 4 weeks after receiving product and after being worn 5 times. Piece of crap.  Tried to return it, alas its past the window of return and have been unable to find a method of communication with sellers"
1.0,I should have gotten my regular size. I went by the comments and the size chart that said they ran small. They were way too big.
1.0,This product is extremely small.  I based my purchase on the previous positive reviews and boy was that a mistake. In my case I should have ordered two sizes larger. I feel like the Hulk and I'm going to burst through the shirt.
1.0,Defective and i can’t return it. The whole mask is hard a rock. Do not buy.
1.0,"We've tried two of these watches, and both had same issue: Seconds hand were loose, and easily knocked off when watch was shaken, i.e. when my kid played basketball, or other sports, which delivered slight shock to the watch!"
1.0,5'11 180. Too short. I looked ridiculous.  Ordered the large... sent back.
1.0,"Fit is decent, long so they gather at ankle a bit. Material is soft but feels odd -not a familiar blend or maybe it was colors. Biggest issue is they smell like chemicals. I washed them in Woolite &amp; air dried &amp; the smell didn’t leave so off to Goodwill they go. Maybe someone else won’t mind but I don’t feel comfortable putting it against my bare skin."
1.0,U get what u pay for...after a few days the crystals started falling out. The the ball broke completely off the post. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Very poor quality elastic did not last at all. Don’t buy these. Now my girlfriend thinks I’m a cheap. If you want her panties to come off easily buy these the elastic is terrible
1.0,I preface with I have bought many of this brand in the sane size with no issues... These were cut weird and smaller than normal Rae Mode sizing. Really strange. I also had to pay to return them myself even though it's an obvious error in manufacturing.
1.0,Ruffles on sleeve weren't sewn properly and one side stuck straight up in the air.
1.0,"Very cheap material, does not match the description, nor the picture and it is very badly made. Don't waste your money."
1.0,They don’t fit the glasses well they fall out of the frames. If I could give a zero I would!!
1.0,the shades started peeling
1.0,Don't bother. Charging port is in a bad place ( side of foot) that can cause blister. Remote never worked. Cheap....is true to size though.
1.0,Super cheap and paper thin.. there is another seller selling these but they are thicker I will look for those. I use these as actual septum rings because they are more feminine looking.. however these are not useable..
1.0,Ugly don't like it
1.0,So ugly forgot to return it. I think I just threw it away. The color was black.
1.0,"The product was not as advertised on Amazon, poor quality shirt material very cheap, graphics were of very low quality.  Would not recommend wasting your money purchasing this shirt you will be disappointed.  On top of that to return the item which I did, you are required to pay postage."
1.0,Much smaller than it appears. Leather is not of high quality.
1.0,I wanted to love this and would if it were for all the snags it has.... and could tell how much more it would snag so returned.
1.0,"The screw driver they sent doesn’t work and even seemed to strip the low quality screws making these unusable. I even went as far as buying a separate watch screw driver kit, and still no luck removing the screws"
1.0,Muy pequeño y cadena pequeñísima. Por la foto pensé que era otra cosa mucho mejor y caí como tonta.
1.0,Shrunk a lot when washed. Will need to be ironed as well.
1.0,Very cute trying it on but HUGE hole after single delicate wash/no dry cycle. Poorly made.
1.0,"I got this as a gift and she only wore the dress for about 20 minutes and when she went to sit down the strap broke.  They won't let me return it because it was past their deadline, which isn't really right as I bought it a few weeks before I was even giving it to her as her gift. Very poor quality. Not impressed and will not be buying again."
1.0,Did not fit and bought 2 sizes up
1.0,Dissatisfied.
1.0,The material was very thin and it looked cheaply made. It didn’t resemble the item in the photos
1.0,Not pleased. A powdery substance is emitted when polishing.
1.0,"The way the dress falls, the seams are in weird places on your body. The material is...stiff but decent quality. I'm not at all happy with it and will never wear it because even though the size is right the way it's made is unflattering.  Gave it to my 5 year old for dress up. Dont waste the money."
1.0,Fabric isn’t the nicest.
1.0,"My glasses broke 2 dsys, after warranty!!! I am really careful with my things.  This is the 2nd pair!  I love the,style, but noticed this pair wasn't as durable as the first pair.  Bummed!"
1.0,I wasn't expecting a great necklace for the price...but this one looks like it came out of a bubble gum machine.
1.0,"Bad quality, weak magnets. The magbets feel off when i walked around. The 'diamonds' are clearly plastic and the gold feels low quality as well. It is an ok product, but bad for the price"
1.0,This was very very small! I ordered up one size and it was extremely form fitting! It was also slightly sheer but that didn't bother since I a thin undershirt or slip would work. Just beware of the size unless you want a skintivht and sheer dress. It leaves nothing to the imagination!
1.0,Do not buy! I rarely ever leave a bad review....but...When I first got this product I loved it and though it was beautiful. That was short lived. It has been a literally and ALL my crystals have fallen out. I am left with white balls that have empty craters in them. Definitely NOT worth the money. I am very disappointed.
1.0,I ordered a small and I received a large. So upsetting.
1.0,"Very Very thin material. When I tried to wrap it on ,y cloth patriotic wreath, it ripped. Not worth the price."
1.0,"Unbuckles / loosens itself every time I sit down, because of release button design.  Makes it pretty useless."
1.0,"Looked good. Had no complaints, until it broke. Yesterday. So it lasted a month? Guess it was good that I waited to review..."
1.0,My daughter has only wore these shoes 3 or 4 times and one shoe has already stopped working and she hasn't even had them a month
1.0,Yuk. Just ever so basic.
1.0,"The bag unraveled before I even used it, the pictures were deceiving"
1.0,Small ! And see through
1.0,"Ugly purse, bigger then expected and photo didn't reflect how shiney it is."
1.0,Poor quality and two sizes smaller than normal
1.0,"First of all I'm short 5'4 with longer torso short legs, I typically wear retro 50s style dresses or floor length boots style,  I bought this because it was a great price on what I thought was a rockabilly style dress, and it definitely is along those lines but the skirt is definitely not full enough for a petticoat,  it's sort of full but it's just an odd cut and it's ABOVE THE KNEES so not one of my petticoats even the shorter ones don't go even if it was a full enough skirt, also the top just fits weird, it is flattering on the waistline but that's it and the fabric is like cheap polyester and HOT AND ITCHY,  terrible all the way around in my opinion I'm gonna give it to my 11 year old bonus daughter to play dress up in but I definitely can't recommend this dress unfortunately"
1.0,"Ordered one size up like recommended, and still too tight on my wife. She is a beautiful woman and thought I would try, but no go."
1.0,not sterling silver finger was green in 5 minutes
1.0,This is pjs. I thought it was an actual outfit.
1.0,Already broke. The big hand just flops around. 😡
1.0,"This is not a wrap dress. It has an elastic waist and you are not able to adjust it. Very disappointing, even the Q&A is wrong."
1.0,"I’m a thong wearer, but this.... no good reason or point."
1.0,I placed them in my shoes and spent @20 mins or 30 with both shoes. I worry the shoes and these just ripped off. They're very hard to stretch.
1.0,Love the earrings but the unstable post broke after our LO wore them less than two months.
1.0,"When you say you will see it on a certain date, change it then send different colors so girls don’t match in the picture, it is very frustrating.  Purchased multiple items clothing wise, nothing was consistent, delivery, correct sizes quality of products was very disappointing.."
1.0,"This jacket looks beautiful on the picture but smells horrible, is so cheap, bad quality and is not even warm, the lining inside feels like plastic, very disappointed!"
1.0,This DIDNT COME WITH THE STICKS!!! It’s totally useless and now I have to find a way to fix it right before Christmas 😡
1.0,Too large for me in the waste line. The pattern didn't match up on the front. Too long for someone under 5' 4&#34;. Not complicated to wear. Top isn't see thru. It's double lined with the same print as the dress.
1.0,The dress would be cute if the seams were where they should be. They seem to be hit or miss with the craftsmanship based on the reviews.
1.0,"Boxy shape, very unflattering. For me, larger/loose on the top than on the bottom. After one wash as directed on the tag, seams rolled at sleeves."
1.0,These pants are more like tights than leggings.  They are very thin and sheer and the sizes are much smaller than labeled. I would not wear these out of the house. They are fine for pajamas or under a really long shirt but you can see through them.
1.0,"Loved the shirt. Am a size 12.... NO WAY this large is going on!<br />Too bad. Great color , cute pocket."
1.0,These lost their rose color after one day and turned my skin blue. Beware!
1.0,Pure junk!
1.0,"This literally broke within minutes of opening, the whole chain snapped. Poor quality."
1.0,Extremely weak magnet can’t even wear them
1.0,"Waterproof, pretty, classy, simple and apparently quite fragile. The chain link wrist band must be made of cheap metal because it came unwoven and I honestly do not know how. It looks as though it got caught on something and if it were legit steel it would have noticed the amount of force needed to cause the damage. Really disapointed but I guess thats what you get with a $45 watch."
1.0,They are beautiful but they kinda make my ears itch. Broke after 3 uses.
1.0,Ripped at mid face seam on second wear!!!!!
1.0,It came dirty👎😞
1.0,Sizing is ridiculously small.  First I ordered L - returned it.  Then XL - returned it.  I'm done.<br /><br />Wake up Amazon - customers are getting tired of shipping Chinese garments back and forth due to rampant lack of size standards.
1.0,Very low quality. I will never order again.
1.0,Huets pushing thru ear and bulky so the sz stud part hangs over lobe.
1.0,"thin material , not very good quality"
1.0,The color is neon orange!  It looks nothing like pictured.
1.0,"I am 5’ 2” tall, 164 lbs, 38” bust (36C in bras), 31” waist, 42” hips. I purchased this cropped sweater in size Large. The sweater is made of a light, incredibly soft fabric. It’s stretchy as heck. However, it’s wayyyy more cropped than I expected, and not loose around the bottom hem at all which might have helped the situation if it was looser. It definitely looked more like a small than a large on me. Very disappointed, especially considering there are no larger sizes available for me to try sizing up too."
1.0,"I'm a &#34;large&#34; so I ordered XXL and it was EXTREMELY small.  Actually fit like a small.  I understand that they run small, but this was ridiculous and not even close."
1.0,will not fit over my glasses and there aare small
1.0,"My wrist is 8 inches in circumference so the watch band was not long enough to hold the watch securely to my wrist.  I removed it and I carry just  the watch case in a leather change purse.  Ordering a longer band from Amazon would probably be a problem because the pins that hold the strap to the watch case leave are so close to the case it's probable that another type of watchband would not fit.  If Casio offered this watch in two watchband lengths it would be a great thing, but they don't."
1.0,Tried on and its Too Large!
1.0,It mis fired more than fired. The report was barely audible. Loading was troublesome. Really JUNK. Hard to understand that this is German made&#62;&#62;&#62;
1.0,It was not the same dress as the picture... it had 1 thick strap on reach side. The material was stretchy
1.0,"The sizing on this is way off-small.  I normally wear a 1x or 2x, but could not get this past my thighs, and this one does not run any larger than 2x it appears online.  I actually purchased multiple Fajas & Marena garments due to Tummy Tuck & muscle repair, and returned most of them.  I found the Fajas garments run even smaller than the Fajas sizing chart suggests.  I'm 5'7 tall a wear size 18, and normally wear a 1x or 2x size - but I found that the Fajas Diane & Geordi 2397 Women's Full BodyShaper in size 3XL/44 (Fits 48-51 Inch Waist) fit the best and HAD THE BEST TUMMY SUPPORT for after surgery (awesome tummy control).  However, I'm thankful that my mother in law sews because the butt cheeks were too large and the leg band was too large (I have a flat butt and skinny legs).  She was able to sew the Fajas 2397 Full Body Shaper to fit me perfectly - so I recommend the Fajas Diane & Geordi 2397 model for after a tummy tuck."
1.0,Not happy - cheap fabric shrinks a LOT
1.0,XL was just tiny. Returned
1.0,This was the cheapest knitted yarn with this type of sweater it’s horrible it’s not fit for an animal to wear a waste of my money
1.0,Smaller than expected and stinks...
1.0,Terrible quality. Seams ripped after trying it on. Really awful quality; find another leotard brand.
1.0,"Ordered a navy and a black, but they were both black. They are perfectly identical next to each other even though one package said navy and one said black."
1.0,it says 10 but I only received 9
1.0,I really don’t like it design
1.0,"To small did not fit as expected. Teturned the item expected refund to go back to my visa card, very upset it was put on a giftcard."
1.0,The rose gold cover actually chipped away after having this only 3 days. Terrible quality.
1.0,The product is nothing like the pictures. Colors are not UT colors. Seller is horrible to work with.
1.0,Ivory color is white. I would not recommend at all.
1.0,"This hat is literally hot garbage. It's costume grade material, not velvet, floppy as hell, ill-constructed, and hideous. The best thing this could work for is cutting it up for a pattern, but the shape is so wrong that it may end up in a bonfire. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,Purchased 3 pair and all three fit like women's leggings instead of jeans.
1.0,"Too baggy compared to what I bought almost a dozen times before. The off color and bagginess made my new clothes look worse than the old clothes I was trying to replace,"
1.0,This dress is way too small. I ordered ab XL and my friend who wears an XS barely fit into it. Returning it
1.0,This is a joke - I cannot believe the seller has not been shut down or removed from amazon. I feel bad leaving this kind of feedback but I don't want any other buys wasting their time. I opened my package and there was a bright blue dress with ruffled looking sleeves almost made of a spandex material. Super cheap and would fit a 9 year old. Do not buy. :(
1.0,Not the best cheap looking
1.0,"after one wash, while trying to wear, the sweater gave away all the stitches on the side.. never seen something like this"
1.0,This ring looks great but it turned the area of my finger green within minutes.
1.0,"China strikes again! What you see in the photo is not what you'll get. Instead, expect a poorly designed spandex monstrosity. The flower pattern is even a knock-off. Go figure."
1.0,They are very ineffective and barely reduce glare from incoming headlights. Really sorry I wasted my money on them.
1.0,Couldn't get the right angle to see properly. Bought it to apply make-up without my glasses on. Used it once. Couldn't get a good angle to work with.
1.0,Fell apart after 1st hand wash. Awful.
1.0,"I had high expectations for this Gstring. Unfortunately,  from my research,  the entire male anatomy should fit inside the ring. Mine doesn't and just inserting my penis through the ring is not pleasing. Nothing wrong other than not fitting in them. Would buy again if they make larger rings."
1.0,Did not receive the item I paid for. Inside of this item I received the moon metal sculpture with a “ star trek” pendant. It was not the image I paid for.
1.0,"My husband wanted these shorts for work. I think I have ordered these at least five times, maybe six times. My husband wears a size 36. The last pair we received was way too small. They looked like kids shorts. Other pairs have been way too big. It's a bummer because my husband likes these shorts, but the sizing of these shorts haven't been accurate.  Returning has been frustrating and disappointing . Left me feeling helpless. Save the stress in purchasing."
1.0,"UPDATE.  I AM RETURNING THIS COAt. There’s a huge hole in the sleeve where the wrist goes.  Not ordering coats from amazon again. This is the 3rd coat I have to return.<br /><br /> am 165 lbs, 41 inch bust, 35 inch waist and 42 inch hips.  I ordered a size XL based on reviews saying to go up a size.  Even though I sized up, it’s still a bit tight but wearable. It’s a cute coat. Very light.  Not sure how warm it’ll keep me during the colder winter days but I guess we will find out.  I had to kind of finger brush the fur on the neck part to make it look nicer....it smells funny so I’m airing it out and I also sprayed my perfume on it.  Hopefully that smell goes away.  If you’re planning on buying this coat, buy 2 sizes up.  I have NEVER given that advice in a review until now so, take my word for it."
1.0,This is the worst product I bought from Amazon. I paid $17.00 for a plastic tiny sword that I could have bought at a novelty store for $2.00. My grandson only played with it for 10 minutes and its broken. I would not recommend this product!
1.0,"Even though the size was men's XL, the socks were way too small for a 13 year old boy."
1.0,"Waste of money, this are ridiculously cheap, don't waste your time unless you are buying for a 5 year old"
1.0,"Though I like the sweater's design, it is not as pictured in the photo.  The upper sleeve is raglan to the elbow , then becomes very snug.  The color is a very wearable neutral, and the high-low hem is just right for coverage on my 5'5 frame.  The major problem with this sweater is that it is very loosely woven and snags like crazy.  I didn't catch it on jewelry .  I think it just snags from normal stuff like taking g a coat on and off.  I'll get 3- 4 wears out of it, then probably won't want to bother repairing it anymore."
1.0,"I ordered it because it had rating of 4 stars.<br />MUST NOT BUY<br />It is NOT case friendly, it leaves TONS of fingerprint.<br />Also after you put it on, it feels like there is white layer on it. Screen don't look clear as it used to be anymore.<br />When I put the case on, screen protector cracks (because it is not case friendly, my case is not thick, it is those tpu gel, transparent ones)<br />Of course, the dust get stucks on the sides<br />It effects the front facing camera little.<br />Don't recommend.<br />But tbh, no company can really make s8 and s8 plus tempered glass screen protector well becayse screen is curved. Recommend plastic film instead."
1.0,"Vino roto, no sucedió después de usar prenda. Ya estaba descosido."
1.0,The dress is so long even though I ordered a small. I am 5’7” so not short and it was way too long. It’s also almost like a rubbery shiny material which I really dislike. I will not be wearing this dress!
1.0,Its really cheap- not attractive and not worth buying
1.0,"This is not a down coat. It's barely a coat, actually, it's just a very thin piece of fabric; I have many sweaters that are warmer."
1.0,They shrink after washing
1.0,The glitter on this gets everywhere and doesn't come off!!
1.0,"I am very disappointed with the fabric. Very see through and the material I wanted and expected to receive was just printed on cheap fabric to make this outfit. Not impressed, especially for the price"
1.0,"Way to small for a three x, gave it to my daughter."
1.0,"Good detail, heavy and very small. Barely fit my child’s face."
1.0,"Very cheap, do not recommend. Everything will fall apart"
1.0,"Super cute masks, but unwearable because it sticks out on the sides and leaves a gap so you’re not protected. Can mask creators please learn that you need coverage all around your entire mouth and can’t have the sides wide open ugh."
1.0,Very disappointed not like the picture shows. Will not buy  again.
1.0,"When I received this and opened it, it was tarnished! I have returned it."
1.0,"It is comfortable , however i think it's kind of tricky and hard to take it on and off to switch!<br />Also, it started to irritate my skin Abit after wearing for so long...could be because of sweat but i notice almost like a rash.."
1.0,Ordered a size 6 they’re more like a size 9
1.0,Arrived opened. Oil was everywhere. First application created awful stains on my boots and literally ruined my $300 pair of shoes. There are much better products out there to care for leather. Terrible product.
1.0,Do not buy! I washed it once and it came apart!
1.0,You can see right through this and its not to be worn in public unless you want everyone to stare at you.
1.0,Fit great until i washed them and all shrank about 6-8 inches. So now my wife is wearing.
1.0,Asian sizes so sad! Beautiful top
1.0,Can't see through them. Too &#34;waivy&#34; looking. Like looking through a glass bottle. Gave them to my 8 year old.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and elastic broke right away.  DO NOT BUY
1.0,"Runs very, very small. i ordered 2 sizes bigger than i usually get and it is still too small."
1.0,"While I love the look of these in the photo,,,They are huge!  The fit was very strange!  They were heavy and uncomfortable as well.. I was very disappointed and back they went, :("
1.0,Returned mine. Too big
1.0,"This is a great looking watch, but since it stopped working in two months it doesn't do me much good.  I didn't buy this watch to be a bracelet, I bought it to tell time.  The hands get caught at the same position and won't advance past the 10.  That great two times a day, but is no good for the rest of the time!  I would not recommend purchasing this watch."
1.0,They are very stiff and don't wrap around the head as shown in the pictures. They stick out. So I had to return them. The colors are bright as shown in photos and look pretty though.
1.0,I got two pairs of these goggles for my son.  The first pair came with a broken nose piece.  The second pair's nose piece broke on the first day of use at swim practice.
1.0,"These are very short from top to bottom.<br /><br />They were initially form fitting (not at all too tight/small), but quickly became loose after just a couple wears and washes."
1.0,the worst ever. i have never wrote a bad review. but this was bad. the label said 3x i gave it to my 10 year old granddaughter. not happy i wanted it for a special day . so small hope she can wear it . beware of this product
1.0,It ran very small. It is made of itchy material. It was very unfortunate. I thought it was loose fitting and of silky material as that it what the picture depicts. The pants are bell bottoms and so is the top.
1.0,"Ordered these - they were cute until I washed them - shrunk about 5"" in length, but stayed puffy up top - put in goodwill bag after wearing once."
1.0,"runs small.  should know made in china that it would be small.  fits like a jr size, not women size."
1.0,Too small and too skimpy for anyone in my opinion.
1.0,This dress is enormous. The material is thick but still looks and feels cheap. The design on this dress isn’t flattering for petite/ slimmer girls. I’m usually a medium and I purchased a small and even that was too big.
1.0,When my package arrived both of the choker necklaces were broken.
1.0,I bought this as a gift to my daughter i sent it to her and she tryed to put it on and some of the links were missing to it and it broke my daughter couldnt even use it. I was very disappointed and got my money back i wouldnt recogmend these to anyone. There made extreamly cheap and there  flimsy  there not as pretty as the picture shows and they break very easy i was very disappointed on this not even worth what there asking for them.junk!!!
1.0,Snags super easily and don’t put in dryer
1.0,not the right size
1.0,Arrive broken ...totally not worth the price I paid. Thank goodness I can repair with a hot glue gun otherwise I would have a very disappointed birthday girl.
1.0,"The lenses are great and I really liked these glasses.  Unfortunately, they did not last long. Side arm separated/broke after about a month of regular use."
1.0,Runs extremely small length an width wise would not purchase again. Would return if it was such a hassle.
1.0,There is a strong plastic curvature underneath the cushion which hurts if you keep the shoes in your feet for a long time. I suggest to go for more flexible insoles in you go through the same trouble.
1.0,Too small and colors are flourescent
1.0,"I seriously doubt that these are gold-plated, as my ears became infected 2 days after wearing them!  Also, the backs are so tiny I couldn't hold them to put them on.  Had to take some backs off another pair.  Do not recommend."
1.0,Purchased this as a Christmas present for my sister-in-law and had to return it.  The material is incredibly cheap and flimsy.  The printed giraffes are barely visible.
1.0,Too small and beyond short :-(
1.0,The material of the band is strong but I'm having problems with it staying on. 2 to 3 times in an hour I'm adjusting the watch so it will not fall off.
1.0,You'll be better off using a nylon stocking.  Very cheaply made
1.0,pictures as a loose product but it isnt
1.0,"While the hat is beautifully made, it is way to big for most people. Wish I would have read all of the reviews prior to ordering. Highly disappointed!!! Had to return it and ended up spending an additional $7 in shipping and handling for both the sending and returning. Frustrating!"
1.0,It was an ok product. I had to return it due to too long and material seemed too cheap.
1.0,It is very cute but I didn't realize/expect that it is made out of a very heavy metal like material. It's very heavy and uncomfortable to wear
1.0,"They are very pretty for Van Gogh fans, but they did not fit my face.  Too large and I returned them."
1.0,Very disappointed this is cheaply made!! It looks cheap feels cheap and over just isn’t what I thought it was going to be!! Don’t waste your money!!
1.0,This item is not for adults! Bad advertisement!!<br />This is for kids! Kids size
1.0,Poor quality. Bow ties ripped right off. The shirt almost melted being ironed and all the strings pulled automatically. The pants were excessively small.
1.0,It was a 1x...looked like a 4x. Grossly out of proportion...no room for your bottom.
1.0,this product came with broken and missing pieces
1.0,"For a 4XL, the the middle sinched in to 23 inches and ripped. This thing is absolutely garbage and doesn't even look ok in the slightest. It looks like a table cloth."
1.0,It’s a no.  I got this knowing from reviews that the cord was long. It was so ugly we didn’t even bother using it for the game.
1.0,"Definitely not true to size. Unless you're petite, you will definitely not be... covered."
1.0,"I disliked it because when it arrived the light was messed up , when I pushed the light button only parts of the watch lit up and then it was just a spot of light in two places botched up , very displeased !!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap!  They broke the moment I put them on.
1.0,The dress was nice but I came rip like if somebody else had put it on already . I got a large and it was to small it seem like a size medium.
1.0,The unicorn fell off after the first try... sizing is WAY off ... not worth the trouble ...
1.0,Nunca llegó y nunca recibí el reembolso
1.0,"It looks nothing like the picture and the material is cheap. The jewels are very fake and huge. Again, not at all like the picture. Barely had a waist line and smallest size was made for someone with a huge bust. Terrible buy."
1.0,"Very very cheap quality, and it comes from China.  DO NOT BUY IT"
1.0,"whew what a mess! they turned my fingers blueish/black, and looked like halloween costume quality. they also didnt fit very well."
1.0,"Way too long,  too tight at the top"
1.0,I don't like how its not Velcro or has snaps..hard to stay fasten...pretty much sucks!!
1.0,Bought these a few months ago didn’t take them out to use until today but come to find out they are not 20g. They do not fit my nose at all. They seem to be septum ones but the description made it seem as though they would fit the nose ring where studs usually go.
1.0,"The vendor's delivery was timely; however, the elegant timepiece itself was timeless:  out-of-the-box the hour and minute hands were at least 30 minutes unsynchronized (when the minute hand was at 12, the hour hand was half way between two numbers, so one wouldn't know whether, for example, it was five or six o'clock) and within the span of its first eight-hours it had gained two hours.  Not a keeper."
1.0,I ordered a size up and couldn't even get this to go over my hips. It was THAT small. According to the size chart I'm a Large. I ordered XL. It only went up mid thigh and there was no way to stretch it to go any higher. I really wish it would've fit. Looks like it would've been a fun swimsuit.
1.0,"The material is very poor, it is not worth the price"
1.0,This is one of those items that is just NOT worth the price...it looks longer in the pic than it is...its way thinner than it looks...my opinion is its nothing more than a short bathrobe. ID say it would be something to wear when its a BIT chilly out and if you plan to wear a sweater type under it then better order a size up because this does run small and this cost $29 but Id only value it at about $15. Very disappointed I wasted my money and didn't keep the deliver envelope it came in to return it.
1.0,Doesn't fit nicely. The sleeves are way too big and baggy for the size of the jacket. Doesn't look good on. The color is not like the picture either. It's a very dark yellow. Will never wear it.
1.0,The flip flop base came apart after 2 months.  For as much money as I spent on these flip flops I would expect them to last longer. :(
1.0,Normally wear a medium.  Order a large and a 10 year old could not have worn this.  Largest size is an extra large so I didn’t bother to reorder.  I’ve returned
1.0,Had to return them.
1.0,Very uncomfortable to get on
1.0,An XL or XXL is really an M. Skip it.
1.0,"Today my son’s coat arrived from Amazon. When I took it out of the box I noticed that the label on the front was upside down, but thought, “ What’s the big deal, but let me see if there are any quality issues.” So, I opened up the coat and turned the sleeves inside out to find to my shock and horror pictures that resembles Adolf Hitler! I am disgusted by this coat company! Boycott Bigzzia coat company write to Amazon! Sickening!"
1.0,These pants fun so small. They seem like they are cut for women not for men.
1.0,pants  is toooooo big  need a 32 not a 3X pants
1.0,"I received 2 watches. Neither watch works. I correctly replaced the batteries. One watch works, the other does not work fully. I sent an email to Auth-Store 7 days ago. No response."
1.0,even though they were really cheap and i wasnt expecting to much from them you would think at least the nose piece would be on some what strait!
1.0,"hard wires underneath the bras came off after a few times of washing and that poked and hurt my skin. Not worth of penny and even time consuming, bras at ross are much better than these."
1.0,"Measurements in image shown wrong. I thought it should be 155mm but its 147mm, I don’t need."
1.0,"I wear an adult size 14, however, when my order arrived, it was equivalent to a child's size 14"
1.0,"Product is cheaply made, holes in material, tags falling off, after washing it's safe to say they shrunk down 2 sizes to fit my 4 year old when they were for my 6 year old."
1.0,wayy too small
1.0,Excellent shorts. I love them. Perfect fit too!
1.0,"Although this anklet was super cute, it broke very easily. I tried to give it another chance and ordered another one, that one broke as well. So I give up, I wanted to love this anklet."
1.0,I was very disappointed. It was advertise as a cotton t-shirt. It is not it is silk stretchy material. Not cotton at all. This would be a great shirt if it was a real t-shirt.
1.0,Well the skirt is too small the shirt was big
1.0,One of the necklaces broke on day one.
1.0,Not at all like thin optics...very uncomfortable and they fall off easily...I made a huge mistake in purchasing this item.
1.0,"My kid is heartbroken.She loves these shoes. They are her absolute favorite. She looks for them as soon as she gets home from school. We gifted them to her for Christmas, and it is one month later. And they are almost unwearable already. I didn’t expect them to last forever, because to be honest she used them a lot. But i am dissatisfied with them only being usable for one month."
1.0,"It will NOT stay in place.  Any time it touches something you lose the specific tension you set.  I have had other magnetic bands and they did their job, mostly."
1.0,Expected material to a bit heavier.
1.0,Um .... not sure who these were made for ..... but not me.  I even ordered a size larger than I thought I would need .. just for some extra room.  NOPE.  Sent them back.  Not for the pear-shaped ladies.
1.0,This product says it’s true to size not true. I ordered thee Capri leggings in the size I wear but they were to small. I sent them back and wanted to order the next size up and they were all out of stock . I wanted the capris for the summer looks like I won’t have any would not recommend this product.
1.0,"I'm very disappointed in this dress. I thought I was getting a dress that was a khaki color. Instead I received a dress that was an ugly pea green color. The dress is cute but.... if I wanted a green dress. I would've purchased that color. Stop advertising a certain color. Then when we receive our purchase. ITS A WHOLE OTHER COLOR......!!!!!!! That's so unprofessional in my book. Now, I don't have an outfit for this event I was supposed to attend. I put my faith into this one outfit. I didn't think that I would've needed a back up dress. In case this one didn't fall through. I learned my lesson. Good luck to whomever want to take there chance in ordering this dress. But..... you've been warned...."
1.0,Always beware of t-shirts shipped from China.  You have to order a xxx to equal a large.  Most of our clothes is made in India or Pakistan.  At least they use American sizes.  Also Chinese made clothing is very poor quality.  And the necks are huge in the back as per Asian style clothing.
1.0,Returned! Looks nothing like the picture! Looks & feels cheap!
1.0,Didn't look anything like the photos in the description of the item I ordered. Looks entirely different. Not happy with the purchase
1.0,Had this band for for maybe 1 or 2 months and it broke on me one of the little claps broke and the strap is now not attached
1.0,Love how it looks didnt get yet
1.0,Very uncomfortable. Terrible fabric.
1.0,"Adorable but I have never been able to use it! It has a smell/scent that will not go away. I bought it in November and have aired it out, left it open and recently put a box in it to keep it open hoping to kill the smell but it hasn't helped. I have missed the return window so I will try one more thing and then I'm donating it."
1.0,I don’t like the way it smelled or the material it’s was made of I’m still kind of sad I wasn’t satisfied with it so I’m returning it for my money back I was really hoping to have it for my Halloween costume but I guess not I really hate to give this a bad review but I wasn’t happy with it from the time I opened it
1.0,This bracelet is not 925 silver it came in the mail and it was more brown absolutely hate it and I threw it away
1.0,I returned this. I did not even try on. The material is so cheap and thin.
1.0,"Not at all for thick hair, it was basically useless.  I have straight but medium thick hair, and trying to use this was actually harder than finally teaching myself how to french braid my hair normally."
1.0,A TOTAL SCAM! They literally printed the pattern on to some flimsy cheap see through spandex. Not the same as the description or pictures!
1.0,"I ordered the 4 pack in 3x.  According to the size chart, It should fit me at 40C, but there was no way these could go around my body.  When they lie flat, they were 12"" across and 12"" from shoulder to ribcage.  Holding them in front of my body they reached just across my boobs tip to tip.<br /><br />The first picture has the all 4 bras one on top of the other because that was how they were packaged.  The other three the bra was lying on a flat surface with a measuring tape."
1.0,Bought this bag in October and after 1 month I have a broken strap. Not impressed!!!! Regrets this purchase
1.0,Runs super small. Not very stretchy. Color is not light pink it's hot pink. Going to return
1.0,Fit small and the material has a weird feel to it. The band is tight and feels like a small elastic band.<br />If your used to a real high banded yoga pant these will drive you insane
1.0,“overjoyed
1.0,Not as I expected .. very light cloth .. does not serve much in the cold
1.0,Band doesn’t securely click into place on watch so it can just slide right off and you risk losing your expensive watch because you purchased a cheap band.
1.0,"This arrived without the cleaning cloth and my glasses don’t fit in the case.  Unfortunately, when I tried to return it.... it says it is unreturnable! I will never buy from them again.  POOR!!"
1.0,"I bought these earrings recently, where to begin..... They are plastic, yes plastic, one of them broke when I took it out of the package, they are nothing like the pictures. I guess the old addage is true &#34;you do get what you pay for ! &#34;"
1.0,Very cheap made. Several broke
1.0,Did not fit my michael kors access watch. Tried several times even with three people. It just does not fit.
1.0,Not really as pictured. Kind of frumpy
1.0,Tiny...horrible and cheap
1.0,Completely see through...might as well just go naked. Threw it away
1.0,too big and bad quality
1.0,Ruffled hem came loose in 2 places when I first put it on.
1.0,Not like the picture at all stretchy material I felt played & lead on
1.0,doesn't fit in the bust
1.0,I really dislike the material on this it feels really cheap.
1.0,The heart itself is nice but the chain is very bad.  It broke right out of the box.  I was holding it in my hand just trying to look at the broken links and it broke again.  Its just not good quality at all.
1.0,"Diameter is wider than my other stud earrings, won't fit in my ears."
1.0,"The top was portrayed as a sweater, but it’s more of a stretchy material.  The first one that I got was definitely sweater material. It was disappointing why one was one way, and a different color was a different material."
1.0,Bought XL which I always do and was disappointed didn’t fit. Material is great quality colors are beautiful the shirts look small but tag shows XL. Won't buy again.
1.0,"So disappointed that these goggles leak. I swim competitively and these leaked on the first swim. Not sure if they can't handle ""speed"" but diving, flipping and just plan racing caused them to leak. Had to clear the water out after each 25. Can't where these -- wish I could get my money back:("
1.0,Look like a child's dress
1.0,This scarf is by Tahari NOT ELIE Tahari which is much more high end brand
1.0,"I will not buy again from this company. The Pearl was off from the earrings when I opened it. When I attempted to glue it back on, the other parts of earring began falling off piece by piece. The earrings appears very low quality as well."
1.0,Poor quality fabric.  Good for one time use
1.0,Poorly made.  Does not want suction correctly around the eyes to keep the water out tried a few times gave up I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,Thought they’d be a tad sturdier. Broke first use :/
1.0,The quality is very poor. It doesn't look at all like the pictures. Will be returning! Don't waste your time or money.
1.0,Don’t dry or size up this shirt shrinks<br /><br />Bought a medium for hubs wore it once I dried it and now it fits me<br /><br />Kid size after the dryer got to it
1.0,These lenses are great.  The way they clip to your glasses are another story.  They are bulky and it is like a huge piece of plastic hanging down in the center.  I thought I would get use to it but they feel like someone holding a finger between your eyes and you just can’t stop looking at the clip.  It’s huge.  I wish they redesigned the clip. Clip on glasses have been around for years and I know this design is due to someone not wanting to pay for the copyright of using a better design but ultimately when you buy a product you don’t care you just want it to work.<br /><br />I would pass on these.  The clip that hangs down and is clearly in your sight of vision will drive you nuts and plus people will stare  at the huge clip and that’s like super uncool.<br /><br />Don’t get fooled by all the colors. If you don’t wear them because of the annoying clip then it doesn’t matter How many you have if you refuse to wear them in a week.  Waste of money.  Please fix the clip design.  You shouldn’t have to go cross eyed wearing this product due to the huge clip.  Haven’t worn them in months.  I say don’t buy these till they change the clip design
1.0,"The phone pocket is in the wrong place, can't have the phone there when squatting or sitting, definitely won't work in spin class.  It is just plain awkward, the pocket needs to be on the side of the hips out of the way of all movements except for when you are doing a split, I can't nor was planning on that.<br /><br />Returned and am looking for something else."
1.0,"I got the Xl because I wear a 10 in jeans, but it just fit weird a little loose in areas it wasn’t long enough for me I’m 5’6 182 it just didn’t fit like the picture"
1.0,"No era lo esperado, el logo de muy mala calidad"
1.0,Do not buy. Very cheap and flimsy. Came already broken in the box. This is fine like thread. Save your money and pay a bit more.
1.0,While wearing only the top quarter the rest gathers around your neck thus you cant see anything of the image.
1.0,"This product is very disappointing, the shoes i received dont even light up and I'm having a very difficult time getting the company to work with me on returning them to the point I just gave up, my money went right down the drain."
1.0,Not as described online. Looks and feels very cheap. Ill fitted.
1.0,"Material is horrible. Straps on the front get tighter, but are still pretty lose. I bought a L and it fits my xs cousin. Looks like an item I bought from wish, just got here sooner."
1.0,I thought these were extenders.  Sorry to have a senior moment.
1.0,"They came apart within six weeks of normal use. I'm past the return period, and TOMS warranty team is going to take 6 weeks just to review my claim. Disappointed to say the least."
1.0,Love the print. They are absolutely adorable.  However they smell like kerosene.  Even after washing them it is still a very strong smell.  We will be sending them back unfortunately
1.0,very long wait to receive item fit is small than expected considering I sized up so it would be loose and roomy
1.0,I purchased this case for my friend since he loves the Miami hurricanes but I returned it. This case is not supportive at all. It’s flimsy and look more like a dollar store case. The logo is cute but this is a NoNo case for him. Returning it wasn’t a problem.
1.0,Beware! This item ships from Hong Kong! This should be clearly stated.
1.0,"I bought this because it says, it supports the arch and has foam cushion. When I got it, it looked promising but... there is no arch support and it didn’t fitted well. I return it the same day!"
1.0,tarnished very quickly.
1.0,"I did NOT get the skirt I ordered!  It does not have the frayed hem, and it’s pencil shaped. ALSO the pockets are slanted with a this “roll” of fabric making them stick out! Not happy."
1.0,These shoes look terrible they are extremely wide and dirty color
1.0,The gauge was supposed to be 18 and it was way to large so I could not use them
1.0,It’s made cheap. Too thin. Too small.
1.0,"As soon as I opened the bag on this jacket, I could smell the chemicals they used during the manufacturing. I’m not sure if it’s supposed to be water proof, but it stank so bad that I immediately washed it.<br /><br />As soon as I pulled it out of the wash it stank like cat urine, which further emphasizes the nasty chemicals they must be using at the factory. After that, it went straight into the trash.<br /><br /> There’s no way I’d put something that stinks like an industrial chemical plant on my kid…"
1.0,"The band is defective. It doesn’t lock correctly  into one side of the watch and repeatedly comes undone. The return window is only30 days. I didn’t even use it until 3 weeks after it arrived, so now they say it’s too late to return. It’s defective!  I’m not happy with this product"
1.0,too small for adult
1.0,Horrible material. Cheap. NOT bodycon or remotely close
1.0,"The product was wider and heavier than I anticipated, they are pretty but bigger than what I thought for being huggies"
1.0,Chain was broken when I received it.
1.0,Look like mom fit long zipper
1.0,"I waited more than 10 days for this product. It arrived, I wore it, and it,broke on the same day I received it. It's a beautiful necklace such a shame it broke"
1.0,"I loved the outfit when it arrived. For so well, however after first wash the fabric looked worn and used. Started to look as if I had it for years :( threw it away."
1.0,"The built in sensor and the bezel of the watch is scratched—this was noted upon first opening the watch.  It was a Christmas present for my husband.  The watch looked used and resold.  Also, when you shake the watch, their is a rattle.  It is going back."
1.0,These don't have any filtering just a piece of yellow plastic does not block any glare. There isn't any difference using them at night. The card that came with the glasses that is suppose to come visible did not come visible. I feel I was ripped off for the 20 bucks and will send them back. Matbe I just got a bad pair but honestly don't waste your money..update took these to my optometrist and these are not polarized or filtered in any way. Just a piece of yellow plastic this is a fraud these people need to be shut down
1.0,This bracelet does not work for Samsung Gear 2 R380 as described
1.0,1oz gold bar is $1700. Not more than that.
1.0,They started to fall apart as soon as I washed them. If you don't plan to wash them then they are great. Very colorful and they look exactly like the pictures.
1.0,Junk junk junk... Waste of $! Wore for 3 hours and one of the strings came off the hook. Tried taking it off to see what happened and the clasp came off the hook... Would have been extremely cute if it woyld have stayed together. Made very cheap and falls apart. Do not buy if you know whats good for yah
1.0,does even look like the picture it’s all green and I hate it
1.0,"back pockets were there, but sewn completely over.  way too tight, could barely button."
1.0,Fits too small.  More suited for a child than an adult.  It also doesn't cover your entire head so we have to buy a skull/bald cap to cover up actual hair showing. Would not recommend
1.0,Not knee high.  Cheap material. Tried on and promptly returned
1.0,"This ring is ugly. Thankfully the person I bought it for likes it, but I was ashamed to give them the ring because of how ugly it is."
1.0,Be aware when buying this product
1.0,Print quality is awful.  Absolutely nothing like the picture shows.  Complete rip off.
1.0,I used them for one day and one of the laces already broke. I would avoid these laces if possible.
1.0,"The top fit me perfect, but the pants are weird. The crotch fell so low, like it was made for someone 6 feet or taller. The bib was loose and had no elasticity. I am almost 5’8” and it was crazy long for me. Had to return."
1.0,Waist too small
1.0,"Completely disappointed. Way too small, took forever to ship, looks nothing like pictured, quality is terrible. Have never been so completely disappointed in an item."
1.0,I would give zero star if possible.
1.0,I read the cleaning instructions. It had to be hand washed!  How would I get the wrinkles out if I couldn’t put in the dryer or press it?  It was far too loose. Sent it back immediately!
1.0,Like wearing a vinyl tablecloth. Doesn’t breathe at all. Sent it back. Too bad because print was cute she turned fit was right.
1.0,Absolutely terrible quality. A hole formed in the pinky toe literally the first day.  I’m honestly disappointed in Amazon for even listing these on their site. They are obviously being returned now.
1.0,"Very Lightweight, unlike previous orders.  Will not order from this company again."
1.0,"The one of the shoes appears to have been worn. The the bottom of the right shoe was dirty. Unfortunately,  because my granddaughter school starts in a few days I want have time to return the shoes. The box was also distorted. I will  not choose shoes from this company."
1.0,NOOOO WAS MOT A GOOD BUY. The dress did have shape to it but the material it was made from was totally disgusting to me not in a dirty way the fabric looked like it had been washed over a hundred times it looks like I had had this dress for years and the color faded it was absolutely horrible. I ordered it for my birthday and needless to say I had to scramble around to find something else because of this horrible fabric this dress was made out of
1.0,Very cheap. Takes. A long time to get order
1.0,I wanted to like these pants so bad! The fit was all wrong and the fabric is uncomfortable. I returned immediately.
1.0,Wore it once and it broke. :( but.. that whole day I wore it I got nothing but compliments! Currently trying to fix it.
1.0,"cheap quality, completely different heal shape than pictured, and sizing WAY too big"
1.0,Cute but sizing really off. My grandson couldn’t even get them on his feet.
1.0,They are very good quality and pretty they just won't stay on my feet. Very slippery and they also took to long to get here.
1.0,I would give  no stars... it doesn’t fit well it keeps falling down.
1.0,Material is extremely thin. Basically a see through. Not manly at all.
1.0,I bought 2 pairs of south pole glasses. The first pair arrived in the wrong shade. This pair arrived lop sided. The nose pieces are not tight and they are uneven. Then the pieces that go on your ears are too wide and stretched out. So disappointed!
1.0,Chain already broken
1.0,"I ordered an extra large, and what was sent looks more like a small. No stretch to the material at all. I actually ripped one of the sleeves trying to take the jacket off and didn’t even try the pants."
1.0,"This could be a cute dress if it didn't have hips sew into it. It has this really, really weird hem that sticks out to attempt to give an ""hour glass"" shape to the dress at the hips. Well not everyones hips are at the same place. I'm 5-0"" so this area of the dress hits me mid thigh making me look large. I could see this fitting in the correct place for taller people. I really don't understand why a dress would be stitched this way."
1.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandson. Got it in a 4t thinking he would be able to wear it for a while. Well that's not the case. The body of the shirt fits him like a 2t would. It's so short it almost shows his belly. The arms are a perfect length so this shirt just looks odd. Pretty disappointed in it because I really like the guitar design on it and so does he.
1.0,So I work overseas and we wear cargo pants all the time. I ordered my size for my hip size. It fits around the hips fine which is not the problem. I am a 43 hip ans 27 waist. but i am fit just curvy. however theses pants are once size from the hips to the ankles. So i literally look like I'm walking around ins a 2001 hip hop music video. The pants are sooooo baggy they cover my shoes...and i wear a size 9 shoes. 5'7 athletic built. the texture is great! quality is great too. But these feel like men pants. the pant legs have absolutely no definition. I wore them one time and every one was looking at me crazy at work. lol I am just going to give it to one of the guys i cant return it due to my location :(
1.0,I ordered these while I was packing to move. I took them out of the box today and learned I had received 2 lefts. It's now too late to return or replace. These are useless to me.
1.0,Return policy.
1.0,I don't know what size these really are but they are NOT 5/16&quot;... The colors are nice and they seem like good quality but they are about half the size of my actual 5/16&quot; rings. Your piercing would have to be positioned abnormally low for this to fit.
1.0,very badly made
1.0,Way smaller than expected I wear a small usually
1.0,"Super flimsy, not worth it."
1.0,"C'mon, man. I was expecting more. The hood is all messed up so it makes you look like a hunch back when you put it on. It's comfy though, which is good. The ears are badly made, those little things don't even stand up, they like droop over your eyes. Whatever, I'll try and figure something out."
1.0,"I liked how this ring looked, but I didn't realize the flower actually sits on top of the ring so it isn't just a band like I hoped. I don't know what size feet you have to habe, but this ring was huge on me. No matter how tight I made it, it didn't feel tight enough. The ring actually broke after only wearing it two days. Definitely would not recommend this product."
1.0,"Looks like a nightgown, not a dress."
1.0,They broken within hours. I wouldn't suggest them to anyone
1.0,This is way smaller in person. The circle is not big at all can barely see it.. and id like some money back because its too much of a hassle to return ugh
1.0,Chronograph was inoperable. 24 hour hand could not be reset. Returned to Amazon.
1.0,"The product took up too much space in my pocketbook and had no flexibility. The description made it sound that it was soft and instead it was incredibly hard. I actually threw it away I was disgusted with its size and hardness. It was not made to be carried, unless you carried a huge pocketbook. Its size also overshadowed everything else I carry in my pocketbook, making it almost impossible to find anything. I hated it."
1.0,Poor quality.  About 2 sizes too small
1.0,"it looked very nice until I received it the ,the letter's I TO AND the black writing ink ran into each of those word's, so I can't give it to my niece like that,so I am requesting to send it back and have my credit card credited, Unhappy"
1.0,"I ordered one size up based on reviews and it was HUGE. So I am returning it. Based on the reviews and all the sizing issues, I will not be repurchasing. Additionally, the sweatshirt was nit soft at all. It was thin which is fine and what I was expecting based on reviews but it was also very cheap scratchy material."
1.0,"I had already bought a clasp from this company and I love the product. So I decided to buy a black ring also, but this is impossible to get into place. There’s a section that pops out and you have to find a way to balance it back in and that is not easy at all with nails. And when I tried to return it, it costs more to return than it is to buy it! Good luck."
1.0,The zipper malfunction soon as I zipped it up !!!!
1.0,Was very disappointed.Really poor quality.I bought two and they broke within first hour.
1.0,"Never got to wear earrings, the post broke off one of them when i tried to put them on.  Disappointing."
1.0,Piece of junk--Made out of cheap felt.
1.0,The 'brown' color arrived looking a dark purple. Not remotely a shade of brown. Wvwn though package says brown.
1.0,"I have purchased Urbane Transit shoes from other vendors in the past. These shoes were defective after a few days of wearing. Big chunks of the trim covering  began to fall off. This vendor expected a 50% &#34;restocking&#34; fee if I returned them. I found that fee to be outrageous. Fortunately, Amazon covered most of the refund, which I appreciate. Watch out for this vendor."
1.0,did not like the elastic band... sent back for different ones
1.0,Doesn’t hold shape at all and the edges are sharp
1.0,It was made for a child.
1.0,Gave this shirt to my 15 year old.  It was too small and the hem is irregular.
1.0,Have used several and the balls and spikes have broke.
1.0,That says it all.  Why would you not have several sizes? Not everyone is made the same size.as you know...
1.0,"This is awful, the sandals are nice but they are listed wrong. They aren’t men’s they are kids so unless you are getting them for a child with medium sized feet do not order"
1.0,"Unfortunately, this arrived broken. This was especially disappointing considering how long it took for the item to arrive."
1.0,Item broke while I was putting it in my ear. Poor quality.
1.0,this suit was NO  where close to the  size listed  I ordered XXL  that should have had a 50 inch jacket  and 44 inch pants  I got a 42 inch jacket and 38 inch pants  I am NOT a Happy Customer  how ever I am pleased  with the service I got  from Amazon  and  will use them again
1.0,Material wasn’t fit for a doll
1.0,Very cheap quality.  The plastic frame broke within two weeks and I always take good care of my glasses.
1.0,Chain too small:<br />Ordered 20” chain<br />Received: 15” chain
1.0,Picture and Description is very deceiving. It makes it sound like you get both. Returning!
1.0,"This ring is so small and dainty, it will only work for a child or someone with really thin fingers.  Not for an average adult."
1.0,Broke with I put it on.
1.0,Way too large. It is NOT for a 0-3 month old.
1.0,See photo. This was my 2nd time wearing this pair.
1.0,"CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!! The stone fell out within 2 hours of wear!"
1.0,One sandal was way looser than the other
1.0,So thin it looks like a slip. Very disappointed was going to wear to all white party.  I have thicker slips that look better.
1.0,Shirt is ripped by the side 1 button is missing by arm. Is cheap fabric. Regret I bought this product. Not like showing in the picture! Not recommended to anybody
1.0,Extremely small for size! Sizes were very tiny like for children!
1.0,They are too tight and will not stay in place.
1.0,Great looking watch but the kit to remove links is hard to use. I have yet to even wear the watch because I don’t have time to get the then removed at a shop. I would say pretty unsatisfactory
1.0,loved the design but the fit is awlful. the material is not giving at all doesn't stretch it isn't soft feeling it's rough and yekky ...returned it ...it also fits very fitted so size up
1.0,"Two different issues going on here:<br /><br />1) The main reason for my poor rating is the fact that I ordered this pack of three in a size Large, but received the blue one in a Medium....<br /><br />2) Second comment for future customers: These do run EXTREMELY small. (For reference, I am 5'7, 145 lbs, 34/36C) I normally wear a Medium in this type of clothing item. After reading the reviews prior to ordering, I thought sizing up to a Large would've been good enough. Wrong... Based on how the Large fit when I tried it on (was way too snug, extremely thin material for my liking, and felt a little short in the torso), if I were to reorder, I probably would order an XL for a fitted look, or an XXL for a roomier/looser fit."
1.0,So cheap and already broke. Stay away
1.0,does not hold at all
1.0,They were smaller than expected. The lenses were more yellow than expected and the nosepads were uncomfortable. I bought it for a holloween costume so they worked for that.
1.0,It's  not real
1.0,They looked very nice but after a couple of days the post bent. Very flimsy. Need to return.
1.0,These are not chokers they are regular necklaces even for adults. They are cute necklaces but definitely not chokers. They took them back with no issues so good company.
1.0,Does not even look like the picture.  Flimsy and super thin.  Looks like it would break with even the tiniest bit of pressure applied.
1.0,Ordered Tan A belt but it looks more greenish.  Definitely will not work for what I need
1.0,Not happy I
1.0,"I was extremely disappointed with this product. It was ok while it lasted. The knit pattern allowed a lot of wind to get through. So it stopped being useful as soon as the fall ended. During winter it was a mess. After a month of use, the top part started opening up on itself. The knitting got completely undone even with careful use. I ended up buying a Thinsulate that costs as much but is a lot warmer and definitely more durable than this product. One thing I liked about it was it's size and fit. But that's not good enough."
1.0,Hat was very cheap looking and ill-fitting. The material was shiny and looked similar to that which is used for umbrellas.
1.0,Got my package today and it was empty.... Send me another one....
1.0,"does NOT work.  right out of the box i put them on, picked up and opened my phone with facial recognition feature.  Cheap plastic in a fancy box DO NOT MAKE THIS PURCHASE>  DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!"
1.0,Just received it and started replacing it with my old one and it started coming unstitched first thing.
1.0,This must come out of China as XL is more like a small.
1.0,This was very cheap looking would never waste my money again on something like this a little kid would not ware something this cheap and fake. Very poor made nothing like what was in the picture
1.0,"Well, as you can see by the photos that the dye from the shirts bleeds and which caused my skin to actually burn.  Since the photos were taken I am on my way to my doctor because blistering has started.  Stay as far away from this product as possible and the manufacturer.  There is absolutely no disclaimer on their site or on Amazon stating this could happen.  Wish I could give it negative stars.  Update:  The doctor said it was actually a chemical burn from the dye.  I am going to go as far as to get the shirt tested, the dye that was used, to see if there are any products in it that would cause a chemical burn.  Spoke with Amazon customer service here in the states and she actually sounded concerned but all they wanted to do was refund my money and give me a 50 dollar credit on my account.  That's a slap in the face.  She also assured me a couple of higher up managers would contact me today.  Getting pretty late and still no one has contacted me about this.  Let us also see if they post this review."
1.0,So I was so excited about this wrap because it looked very nice on however I only got to wear it once at the beach. The whole thing shreds as soon as it gets wet. Horrible! Save your $$$
1.0,Paper thin suede and as warm as my ex-wifes heart.
1.0,import 3x . had to return it.
1.0,Don't like at all.  Have gotten worn down in just a month.  Sole is not as thick as it appears in the pic!!
1.0,Plastic necklace. If you like that kind of thing.
1.0,"This is very unflattering on me.  I am sure that it looks great on others but this is not the item for me.<br />1.&#34; One size fits all&#34;<br /> I am normally a size 2/3 and this item is HUGE on me.<br />2. &#34;VARIOUS WEARING STYLES&#34;<br />There is no way that this could be worn with a &#34;scoop&#34; neck. If you look through the various color options when ordering and notice any of the models standing sideways you will see how far down the back this sarong falls. Very awkward to try to wrap and style as shown.<br />3. PURPOSE:<br /> I understand this is a beach cover up but the material is so uncomfortable against my skin.<br />4.MATERIAL Polyester, Light Weight, Very Cozy And Comfortable<br />It is slightly sheer but I expected a much more light weight material. I find this to heavy to be comfortable on the beach in hot weather.<br />Not really sure what to do with item now. I will never be able to wear it. Maybe cut the straps off and use as a scarf???"
1.0,The product does NOT look like the first image but the image at the end. The colors of the fabric are not as clear and vibrant as the first image. The quality of the fabric feels more like a beach coverup than a dress.
1.0,Absolute piece of junk. Scratches incredibly easily and within 6 months was useless for telling time. Will keep time ok for awhile and then when you least expect it it will lose 15 minutes here and there. Don't rely on this thing for accuracy or you will be late for appointments.. Going back to Casio.
1.0,I don’t know why but both of the necklaces were connected…..Defeated the purpose of TWO separate Pearl necklaces….
1.0,Color bleeding
1.0,"Opened up the pacakage to find only two (2) bags inside, one (1) pink, and (1) blue.<br /><br />Other than that good quality bags, but no worth $6 a piece."
1.0,I was so excited about these but one of them broke as soon as I put the earring in. 😔
1.0,Paint on one of the bears came undone
1.0,"I loved the way this sweater fit. It was just what I was looking for. My excitement was soon crushed within two hours of wearing. I look down and see where I had my purse strap over my body, the sweater material had already knotted as if I had worn for years. Shortly after the day of shopping, the intire sweater was covered in the knots😢. I now wear as a PJ top."
1.0,"This item isn't tie-dyed its printed and its short and wide like a crop top not a full size. The hood part isn't the same color as the top its blue. The blue portion of the sleeves do not start mid arm as photographed, and they are 3/4 length. It's a hot mess. Like a monet, looks good from far away but up close its a blurry mess. And Super short and WIDE."
1.0,This shirt is super cute however it’s basically fits a large is more like a small.
1.0,The panties were just too tight. It didn’t have the size option so i could choose XS-XL. The panties were cute so i went with it. I’m a more thicker woman so I assumed the material the panties would be more stretcher to fit in the correct area without it feeling like you’ll get a yeast infection the next day or let alone suffocate your private areas... Shipping was fine but panties were too small.
1.0,Loved this beautiful lanyard until the ring holding my badge clip snapped off after 2 weeks of wear. Thank you for easy procedure to request a replacement but time will tell if it will happen again.
1.0,Like the look BUT impossible to put phone in case without ruining the case.  Directions are for a different case.  This doesn't fit the galaxy note 9 at all!!!
1.0,Product too small.  Cheaply made.  Couldn’t send them back.  Made in China.  They wouldn’t tell me how to return.  No return information provided even after finally getting a hold of them!!  Do not purchase
1.0,I couldn't even wear it! It looked like it would turn my skin green.
1.0,"This bag is nothing as described.  It’s basically a diaper bag.  It’s not leather, it’s plastic, there is no zipper closure and no inside pockets.  Pretty embarrassing as this was a Christmas present that I’m probably not going to give.  The return process isn’t worth it, so I’m stuck with a bag that won’t ever get used."
1.0,"This item is for someone that small, no elastic return item"
1.0,"cheap material, appearance of pajamas."
1.0,Way to small you will have to purchase them at least two sizes bigger
1.0,Ordered a double D the cup was more like a C! Dont waste your money
1.0,It doesn't look like the picture. I expected it to actually be gold. It is not.
1.0,This is not a quality piece of jewelry. It is basically a piece of inkjet paper and printed and a poor resolution inserted into the charm.  I was fooled By the picture on the page. Save yourself money and don't be fooled. Needless to say I returned it.
1.0,I DIDNT LIKE THIS DRESS ITS CHEAP LOOKING AND DOESNT HUG YOU
1.0,"Looks cheap,feels cheap"
1.0,"The mask was made with the fabric upside down. If you want to use it properly, with the metal strip on your nose, everything is upside down, the word “science”, the beakers, all the formulas, etc."
1.0,The zipper broke after two uses so now we are looking for a new bag.  I know it wasn't the most expensive bag but I would expect it to last much longer than 2 hikes
1.0,Started turning green after 1 day and then the clasp broke :(
1.0,"These came to me and they were velour, velvet, heavy material! because they have side splits, they cant be worn in the winter and it is a winter material, they can not be worn in the summer because they are literally velour and heavy! I sent them back"
1.0,Looks like a box. Does not look like model. Do not buy
1.0,If I could give 0 stars I would I ordered this dress 6 times in the last month I order it a 7th time bc these are dresses we bought for a wedding over a month time the material changed the dress is now so sheer not even a under dress would hide your skin! The dress arrived with white stains all over it and holes in it! How does 6 dresses come perfect and the 7th look like it was made in a barn and like it could fit my 6year old ? I won’t order from them again and it’s a shame because now I’m down a dress for a wedding in a week
1.0,Do not own this ring.
1.0,"We got the dress today and it was not like the picture. The picture shows a mid length dress that has a curved hem edging, has pockets on the front outside, and showing the elastic waist line. The dress that they sent is the right fabric, but no pockets,  no curved edge hem, and is NOT below the knee. The dress came to my daughter upper thigh! It is a<br /> short tunic, no way a dress; I even ordered a size up.<br /><br />I am mostly mad because there is no that this went unnoticed. I have heard a lot of these seller are cheap places over seas just throwing clothes together, not really with a pattern, but we had good luck with another seller so we tried this one. Nope... they obviously aren't following a pattern, they are just throwing these things together. I know these dresses are cute, but unless your child in very very VERY short, they will not work. Your kid will need to be very thin and very very short, plus be flexible that the dress wont be like what you purchased."
1.0,AMAZON JUST ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE.
1.0,Sizing was completely wrong- retiring.
1.0,I ordered a large and got what looks like a small.  Very disappointed in this product.
1.0,it is not like on the photo
1.0,Size is stated as five by five and a half but it is smaller than that.  Passport can be put in it by stretching the material but there is little room for anything else.  You have to put the narrow side of the passport in first and then twist the passport around to get it in the leg wallet.  The second pocket is so small as to be almost unusable for anything but a key or a small amount of rolled up cash.  For me it was just tooooo small.
1.0,"Attention all CUSTOMERS! PLEASE DO NOT! I REPEAT DO NOT! PURCHASE THIS WATCH IT'S VERY POINTLESS REALLY IT DOES NOTHING!!!!! ALL IT DO IS DISPLAY TIME WITH A LED LIGHT IN RED! THE TIME DOSEN'T STAY ON THE WATCH, YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE BUTTON EVERYTIME U WANNA SEE THE TIME. THE WATCH IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND POINTLESS!!!!! I ORIGINALLY WANTED IT FOR THE COLOR, BECAUSE I LOVE ROSE GOLD. IF YOU'RE WANTING THE WATCH FOR FASHION ONLY I GUESS THE WATCH IS FINE! IT COMES WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS. IT COSTED ME 14 DOLLARS NOT WORTH IT! I'M STILL TRYNA FIGURE OUT THE POINT OF THIS WATCH AND WHY IT COST SO MUCH GOR IT WHEN IT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!"
1.0,"This dress is a joke. I’m usually a solid Medium in everything (shirts, sweaters, dresses) but this dress was different. The sizing is weird - doesn’t even look like the picture, and it was way too short. Definitely would not recommend, at least not the pink color."
1.0,xl is way to small
1.0,The strap broke as soon as I put it on!
1.0,Heart is huge.  Stones and engraving you can’t even tell it’s there.  The pictures of the stones and engraving are enlarged.  Not actual size. Would not order or recommend
1.0,Arrived with broken beads.  Cheap product.
1.0,They run really small and are itchy.
1.0,Small and an awful fabric.
1.0,It arrived broken and we can’t return it to get a new one
1.0,The fabric material is super thin.  Not sure how long it will last.
1.0,They were super tight. And the style is cool but you can tell it’s super cheap material I mean the pricing says it all. Only wore them 3 times and hurt my nose cuz of how tight they were!!! Not for adults
1.0,Very pretty but didn't fit to small. Had to return
1.0,it was too big for my watch.
1.0,I'm a size 14 and this belt is too small.  Had to return.
1.0,Material see though and material was cheap. I sent it back.
1.0,Nooo- I aske dseller for refund and they said they could only offer me 30% back!! How is that a fair deal? Complete waste as it comes too small and the sizes aren’t accurate. Also doesn’t stretch at waist -which isn’t normal for a child’s clothing
1.0,Very disappointed! Not true to size at all
1.0,[[VIDEOID:30cf2495283ad880db67337035655db9]] This is nothing like what I ordered. These pieces also look real cheap. Immediately returning.
1.0,Ordered a 2XL and my petite mother still could not wear it. The sizes are not US. Very disappointed and returned them.
1.0,color changed less than a week
1.0,Broke really quick. My husband already lost one piece because it fell off the next day.
1.0,I bought an xxlarge and it fits like a medium! Quality was good-but the fit was crazy! Would not purchase.
1.0,"The chain itself broke randomly. Waste of money, clearly very cheap."
1.0,It came ugly cheap material
1.0,"No finishing stitches on ends, just blunt cut fabric. The design is much less vivid than picture, and fabric is weird stiff texture with very limited stretch. If worn over face, no matter how you place it, it rolls up into your eyes. Very unhappy with overall quality of product, very disappointing."
1.0,Cheap quality. Red around heel cap wore off on the first day he wore them!
1.0,"Item looks like it was used and returned, then re-packaged and sold to me😬😬 I was looking forward to wearing this, but now I have to send it back."
1.0,"This dress came not as advertised. The main draw of the dress for me was the pattern. The pattern on the bodice was lopsided by a couple inches. It looked terrible. The material is cheap which is not too surprising given the cost. The shoulders were way too tight. I bought a size up (8/Med) and the I would be afraid to wear this that I would tear the back if I moved my arms in front. This was such a well rated dress that I had such high hopes for. Somebody else posted pictures of the lopsided design on the front, and mine looked exactly like that."
1.0,the second set everything broken
1.0,"The Spanx pants fit well, but the skirt was made of a different material that did not offer as much stretch as the pants.  For someone with hips or a bigger derriere, the skirt will not work."
1.0,"Returned without trying on. I don’t know if I missed it in the description but there are pearl beads that are placed in random areas on the front of the shirt. I pulled the top out of the bag, saw those, and put it right back in.  Screamed tacky to me."
1.0,this dress looked nothing like the picture. Please dont buy this dress...
1.0,"My 3 year old twins had these for a week, barely wore them and still break them pretty easily within a week (the one pair were broken within an hour of having them)"
1.0,"Size must have been for child, was completely different than pictures! Horrible"
1.0,"FAKE!!! I received a high quality replica! It came with fake paperwork, fake box, and the second hand on the watch is not an automatic! I brought it to a local jeweler who is authorized to sell Breitlings and they confirmed it was a fake!"
1.0,The post broke off after a week. Disappointed in the quality.
1.0,Same as Frost King vinyl foam weather seal. 3/4&#34; wide x 3/16&#34; thick x 17' long. $3 on sale at local dept. store.
1.0,No me llegaron nunca las piezas de Alex y Ani.
1.0,"I bought the 1st one with M size, found too small. Then I reordered another one with L size, but I received the same size as M. The shirt has no size tag, so it is very difficult to distinguish what size we received. So, I am returning it back to the seller again. I will not buy from them again, it is waste of time."
1.0,"They are 55mm lenses, not 52mm, so they don't fit my glasses. They're also much thinner than the original lenses."
1.0,I dislike I can't read the words
1.0,Such a disappointment. I thought these were silk bonnets but they aren’t. They feel cheaply made. They don’t wear well. My $5 bonnet from Walmart works better than these.
1.0,Returning is a nightmare. I am not paying shipping to China for a way too small top. This is sized for children not adults!!! Not soft or stretchy.
1.0,fabric too clingy
1.0,I love these glasses and I thought I requested an exchange on this product. It arrived with 2 cracks on the glass...ill find another seller.
1.0,"So disappointed. The shirt came in a plastic ziplock pouch and when I opened it, the pungent chemical smell almost knocked me out. The picture depicts it as a casual, loose t-shirt and what I received is a cheaply made, shiny (like work out material) shirt that looks nothing like the picture. So disappointed."
1.0,Hard to work with buyer
1.0,"The first one I received had a slash in the words. The second one they sent also had a slash, but in a different place. I had asked them to look at it before sending the second one, but they apparently did not. It's too bad because it would be a  nice product if not defective. They responded quickly, but sent a second defective product."
1.0,"Hate is too strong a descriptive. The belt was a Christmas present for our very-vegan son, and he loved it. It was classy, functional, and could be dressed up or down. Then the belt buckle sheared off the belt after a month's wear.  Amazon return / refund efficient and fast."
1.0,"I had high hopes for this shirt, the material isn’t what I thought and it was tight.  Had to send it back unfortunately"
1.0,I took a size bigger than my size and it was still too small. I was very disappointed
1.0,Say they are stretch and the absolutely have no stretch at all
1.0,Don’t waste your time. These things are flimsy and just not worth your loss in time dealing with them and then ya omg to return.
1.0,"This is VERY small, like a man's lapel pin!"
1.0,"It says in the description that these belly rings are surgical steel but they are not, within one month of getting these rings whatever they are actually plated with started to wear off and infect my belly piercing"
1.0,"I received this dress very quickly, and I am very pleased about that. However, the dress is a different color red than displayed in the picture. I can not make an observation of how the dress fit because I noticed a large tear at the seam before I could try it on. I did not want it to tear anymore. This dress is a very thin delicate fabric, and I am certain that if it didn’t already have a tear in it when it arrived, that it would fall apart the first day I wore it. The lining is very cheap. This dress reminds of the princess costume dresses you can buy a child in a grocery store during Halloween. I am returning this dress, and will not reorder it. I gave the dress a one star rating because it did get delivered quickly, and it would be adorable if it was stitched well, had thicker fabric, better inner lining, and was the color displayed in the picture."
1.0,"My wife received this top, which was too large and unflattering.  Description says “free returns” but when I tried ti return it, the seller sent me a shipping label which required me to pay postage to return in overseas.  I have NEVER had this happen before!  Now I’m going to have to contact Amazon and try to get them to fix this!!!  Really annoying!"
1.0,This is no raincoat. I got soaked in a few minuets. Very disappointed.
1.0,One word junk.
1.0,"The elastic band around waist is not straight , cannot straighten it up, threw it them away"
1.0,I bought two sizes neither of them fit me right. One was too small the other was too big.
1.0,The 'how does this product fit' section of the comments section should have a made for a 'weird body type' option.  I'm sure this product has consistency issues because I see comments where some people says it fits perfect and others have issues like me where the shirt fits the torso but is tight at the arms.  I am not a large person and my arms are slender.  If it wasn't for the small arms I could have overlooked the fact that the writing on one section of the shirt was upside down while the rest was right side up.
1.0,"This is nothing like the picture. Material is cheap, thin, and see through."
1.0,You get what you pay for... I do not recommend
1.0,Looks nice but it ripped after me using it for 1 day. :/
1.0,This dress was see-through and smelled like BO.
1.0,"Not even close to being true to size, it runs at least two sizes smaller than what I ordered.  The dress is very cute, although some people might not like how sheer it is."
1.0,This is my first review on Amazon. This item is so below the standard of any Andrew Marc product I have bought in the past. It is so insulting that someone will send that to a customer as an Andrew Marc brand. The material is so cheap looking and the sewing is bad. I know how that Jacket should look before I have bought the same style before. I returned it
1.0,"Product was way too small for my wife, it appears this is for kids."
1.0,"The manufacturer's notes say these are made for Chinese women, so order up a size. I got XL. Two pairs (blue and white) were at least 3X. The gray was 5X at least (if that size exists). The packaging and labels both said XL for all of them, btw. They were just horrible...and the manufacturer didn't want to take them back. They suggested giving them to family or friends, but they were sized so awkwardly, they wouldn't work for anyone I know. They finally took them back, but grudgingly. The fabric is nice, though,  so I tried to exchange the blue ones for a M...nothing doing. I only got my money back because I just mailed them back."
1.0,"I got this shirt to wear to work, I am a teacher and a mother so I do not buy much clothing for myself. I was not expecting to have to buy another shirt to wear underneath of this one. This shirt is completely see through.  If you buy this you will need a tank top or under shirt."
1.0,Not to good it was broken when I received it
1.0,Not an attractive sweatshirt. Material isn’t like a cotton sweatshirt either. Will return.
1.0,Really loose and not fitting at all.
1.0,This item was disappointing.  I was expecting to love it and it was poorly packaged and didn't come with a sash to tie it or anything.
1.0,"I did not buy this ring set. I did however by another engagement ring set from Pompeii3. I brought that ring set based on these reviews (thinking Pompeii3 was a reputable company). Please, if you do buy this ring set, get it appraised immediately. The ring set I brought for $2,000 was appraised for barely $300 and that was for the gold - the diamonds were worth nothing. The diamonds were of horrendous quality. They were not clear, sparkly, and they had visible inclusions (SI diamonds are not supposed to have inclusions visible to the naked eye). The diamonds also were quite dark.<br /><br />Please beware of Pompeii3 and their ring quality. They also require you to get back to them within 14 days of receiving the rings or they won't accept the rings back. Their customer service was terrible. It took many days and many phone calls to be approved to return the rings.<br /><br />I highly recommend ordering from somewhere else."
1.0,"The pockets pucker out, looks like you're carrying 2 tennis balls.  The back seam is terrible, one side is fine but the other is cut wrong, it's baggy, saggy and longer than the other.  I bought 2 and they are both the same.  Do not buy !!!"
1.0,"I ordered this dress larger than I needed it, and STILL couldn't wear it, because it was MUCH too small. COME ON! Let's have realistic sizing, please!"
1.0,"Terrible product!! No materials list, the dress doesn’t hold together, it feels cheap, and very much NOT linen at all! Made in China of bad quality (not everything made in China is bad or cheap, but this definitely is!). NOT AS ADVERTISED"
1.0,"The size chart is completely off. This dress is huge! I'm an 8/10, but this dress fits like an XXL. It looks like a tent that my whole family can fit in. It makes me feel very unattractive.<br />Returning it."
1.0,my order was priced for 10pcs and they adverized for 50cs. Noy very honest.
1.0,Shirt was a weird material and seethrough
1.0,Very comfortable . Like the sheer stripe on sleeves. Love cotton comfort. Update. This is not cotton and after washing it feels scratchy and synthetic. Very disappointed.
1.0,Every tie is wrinkled and very cheaply made
1.0,Broke the 1st day.
1.0,"Bought this item about 10 years ago and very happy with it.  Needed another one so bought the same size, brand, etc.  The one I just bought is HUUUUUUUUGE!  Nowhere near the same as the 10 year old one.  My whole family can get into this one with me.  Very disappointed.  Suggest you do not order XXL unless you are a monster."
1.0,VERT rough feeling...burlap like
1.0,I only received one shirt. Looking for the other two.<br />I don't want to return my shirt. I want my other two that I paid for.
1.0,I had to return.. One led light stop working right away... got replacement.. replacement pair did the same thing
1.0,"To small,nice belt."
1.0,Too much spandex in polyester
1.0,"The pants smell so bad my house smells like chemicals. I have them washing for a second long cycle to see if I can get rid of the smell. If not, they may have to go in the garbage since the smell is so strong it is nauseating."
1.0,Really cheaply made.We weren’t able to adjust the size like AT ALL.Very disappointed since it looked cute.
1.0,The small is like a large
1.0,Socks were repacked and 1 pair of socks were out of the cardboard holder covered in pet hair and had stains..... Clearly used. The others were full of pet hair also but still in their original cardboard sleeve. Not even worth my time to wash so right into the trash they go.
1.0,"1st: three weeks tooks to arrive<br /><br />2nd: those are the poorest sunglasses I have bougth, poor quality,<br /><br />conclussion: bad buy, spend more coins for better quality ;)"
1.0,"I was  very happy with this until they ripped  the second time  I put them on  Not happy , More Junk to dump on Amazon ?? I am glad I only ordered one pair.  ;-("
1.0,"It is a great price but quality wasn't what I was hoping for, but you get what you pay for."
1.0,I think that these are knock offs. Mine broke within a month of purchase. I emailed about the issue and no one ever bothered to respond. Extremely flimsy and awful.
1.0,"The jeans looks like the picture, but they’re not stretchy and the red dye ran all over the pants. Going to reorder hopefully this ones right. Love the rye dye pants."
1.0,THE material is too bad . i got a defective piece.
1.0,The description states 200 lbs for xl BUT the chest fits more like a medium. Thin. Very disappointing especially when you still need to purchase power  pack.
1.0,"I'm a size 10 and these pants were way too tight - I returned them.  Also, the fabric was very heavy."
1.0,Extremely uncomfortable and almost impossible to fit. The bar is visible under tight clothing. The adhesive is poor quality and made me itch.
1.0,Terrible. Won't stay on the ear so can't be worn. Cute design if iy would work.
1.0,Looks cheap..I wouldn’t buy again any items from this company.
1.0,"Super cute,  but way too tight/ small.  Returned and got a whole size up and those were even smaller! Also very hard to get on."
1.0,"False advertisement. The bottom looks nothing like the photo. I have the same exact body type as the model in the photo. The bottom of the bikini didn't reach or cover my belly button the way it does the model in the photo. The bottom I received reaches way below the belly button, isn't high waist like in the photo, and its shaped weird: its more of a low ride shapeless loose bikini. I am disappointed."
1.0,"Was so surprised when I opened the box, the Niangueen Bird of freedom looks nothing like what you see in there ads. The differences are even more apparent when using a using a magnifying glass, I guess thats why they only use drawings and not true photos.<br />Sent back for a refund"
1.0,These are more shaped like for females. Not very expensive so not to mad just wont wear them
1.0,I got a microphone set instead of this item. I'm extremely disappointed....
1.0,"From the product explanation the consumer is to believe this is a RACK, it is not a RACK it is a cheap piece of vinyl. That's it.  I can't believe all the raving reviews.  Expected to get a plastic RACK.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  THIS IS A WASTE money."
1.0,Very thin and flimsy... Not at all as pictured...
1.0,It was see throw and without inner or lining. Style was good but without lining no use.
1.0,"Do not buy the Rose Pink - within 1 day of wearing the color already started to wear off. You can see the white on the edges. This literally happened within 24 hours. My wife doesn’t even wear it to sleep or in the shower, so no reason for this wear and tear."
1.0,"On-line it's really cute  however  on me  it didn't work at all . I didn't like the fabric  thought it was cotton  and second didn't like the bottom, it simply isn't made for  no 1  an. older woman  and 2 the bottom  made me look just fat  So if your over a certain age and weight  forget this and go on .Reason I didn't return  I'd washed the thing hoping to make it softer. My goof"
1.0,"Really pretty, looks like the picture, shipped within a couple of days... All this was great. However, the chain broke off within 24 hours of putting it in<br />."
1.0,but the paint on it is coming off i want my money back
1.0,"Compre esta pieza porque me encantó pero me quedo un poco pequeña. La lleve donde mi joyero para  ver cómo la podíamos arreglary cuando hizo el examen. Para saber que oro es, resultó ser que no es oro ni siquiera 10 quilates.😳😳 Para verificar la lleve a una casa de empeño y arrojó el mismo resultado. No es oro ni siquiera 10 kilates!!! Es un engaño, un timo."
1.0,"Product description says ""What you get: there are 4 pieces healing necklaces in a package"" But I got only 2. Returned item. Per description there should be two sets making a total of 4. Items will be returned"
1.0,I didn't get it yet
1.0,The shirts came in all different sizes.  Either they were too big or too small.  Also they fell apart before I even got to try them on.  They were cheap to buy and cheap to make.
1.0,"Pros: Fit is nice, true to size, my 8 yo boy said they are comfortable<br />Cons: 3 days in, holes/tears in the toe box fabric and the strap started coming apart. (pics)<br />You do get what you pay for, cheap sneakers, cheap quality."
1.0,"Should have read the other review before purchasing.  Scoured the internet for day of the week underwear and selected these because the picture showed primarily white with a little picture on the front of each pair.  Was wanting white because it goes so much better under clothes.  The underwear we received are assorted colors, none white."
1.0,not what I expected.  bought a 3xl and it fit my friend like a small
1.0,Took over a month to get here..... and then amazon said they lost the package even though it was delivered. XL fit my friend too small even though he is more of a large.
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture. Was a stiffer material than I was looking for.
1.0,"Purchased this dress for an event,didn't  wear it. The material of the dress is polyester which is not flattering."
1.0,Boxy and awkward not at all like the picture
1.0,"I order the B cup, not even close to being a B cup, it was so large, it was more like a double D."
1.0,THE SIZE WAS TO BE 3X THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THE PANTS COULD STRACH TO A 3X I AM A 1X AND COULD NOT GET THEM OVER MY ANKELS SO DISAPPOINTED
1.0,Just opened my package and I'm extremely unhappy with the cheap martial and it has absolutely no elasticity to them. 👎👎👎👎
1.0,"I purchased 2 of these dresses one in white and one in gold.  The gold was a perfect fit, which I tried on upon arrival, so I didn't bother trying on the white one, as both were the same size( or so I thought, according to the tag).  I was attending a very important installation of officers and had to wear the white dress, it had to have been the wrong tag.  This white dress was way too short for the event I was attending.  Totally embarrassed and it was the only white dress I packed. I would like this taken care of."
1.0,Product was not as advertised. Complete disappointment. Will not order from this seller again.
1.0,I could not fit it  was a 3xl don't run true to it size
1.0,One side of the band kept unhooking from my watch.  I wound up throwing it away.
1.0,these pant were huge and I must send them back..They were not a good cut and looked cheap.
1.0,Size is totally way off ! Frustrating at best.
1.0,"horrific - see thru horrible material VERY DISAPPOINTED, I will never ever order ililily again"
1.0,"Had to return, did not work"
1.0,Rubber band broke
1.0,"The hoodie is fine, but the sleeves are very very short so it's basically unusable."
1.0,"Paper-thin, and no lining, so good luck wearing these as swim trunks.  Also, I got medium, and although they technically loosely &#34;fit&#34; around the waist (I'm 31.5&#34;), they are so large around the thighs to be laughable."
1.0,Had the wallet less than a month and the zipper broke :(
1.0,Returned because it felt like it was going to break on my wrist - awkwardly made.
1.0,Not the style for me
1.0,This is completely disappointing and disgusting. I paid for a NEW pair of sandals and I clearly got a USED pair. It's completely dirty and the sole is clearly used. This deserves ZERO stars.
1.0,I received a completely different scarf. I ordered a blue abstract print scarf and received a pink scarf with hearts all over it..
1.0,The fit is terrible and cheaply made.
1.0,I returned this set since I have no idea what the tag says. Seems to not be 100% cotton even though it’s advertised as such.
1.0,Will only fit a doll. Did not see any size selection offered. Disappointed.
1.0,Just was not happy with the product was expecting more out the item.
1.0,Very thin and fragile. 1 broke trying to put on my wrist despite being careful
1.0,It was cute but way too small.
1.0,"I donated it. I bought a 3x I normally wear an xl or 1x it looked awful and nothing like the picture. So I gave it to my teenage daughter who wears a small. It fit me like a crop top. And I’m 5’3”, she’s barely over 5’1” and so tiny. She said what in the world is this? It’s so huggy in all the wrong places! And is it supposed to be a crop top? I felt the same about the pink one but it wasn’t worth sending them bath. Don’t buy it! If I could give zero or negative stars I would."
1.0,It takes too long to get your order it takes more than a month
1.0,The pants arent as shown in the picture. Didnt fit description. Were too baggy
1.0,Was smaller in busy then expected
1.0,"This is crap dont buy, still cant open the lock to wear it. Total garbage"
1.0,"It was beauitful, bur broke a week later"
1.0,"Not child size. I anticipated it to be a woman size based on the photograph, but I held out hope based on the name of the product. Alas, it is not child size, in fact it's larger than another ladies visor I recently purchased. For the price though, I'll just have my tailor modify it to fit."
1.0,Very cute but color turned after wearing 2 times.  Charm fell off after wearing once but ny husband was able to fix it.
1.0,"These fit terribly, even though I followed the sizing guide. The waistband is a piece of hard, firm elastic. No compression."
1.0,Super uncomfortable and very cheap plastic
1.0,"One of the screws came out after 2 days of use. I want my money back. Good idea super poor execution. It’s a waste of money, don’t buy this product."
1.0,Gave it to my daughter for Christmas. The seems are already ripping. The shoulders and under arms are ripped already and she hasn’t had it a week! Very poor quality.
1.0,These are the same type of flip flops you can get at Walmart.
1.0,"Item came in completely missing the pin mechanism on one side. Pin itself looks nice, decent weight and size, but not great quality. Hoping replacement item will be better."
1.0,"They claim that these masks are 4 layers in one spot, and 3 layers in another, however appears to only be 2 layers (you can easily see through the inner layer). Claims to be KF94 (Korean) but isn't labelled as such nor is it labelled KN95 (Chinese). The package has a sticker over GB/T32610-2016 that says GB2626-2019 without the grade (these two are just the standard for judging face masks, not the tested performance such as A/B/C/D or KN95). I am very disappointed because my daughter really wanted Hello Kitty masks for school. Although anything is better than nothing, these are counterfeit KF94s and will not protect your child."
1.0,I'm returning for inaccurate size description.
1.0,Cheaply made trash
1.0,"My granddaughter only wore this once, and it ripped the first time she wore it."
1.0,"Can anyone tell me how the Amazon send me package which is a watch with dead battery,or the watch is dead"
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH IF YOU HAVE EVEN SLIGHTLY NORMAL SIZED WRISTS . I cant even remove the links and it’s way too big for my wrist . I tried removing the links by force and now there’s scratches so I can’t return . Wish I would’ve known you cant make it smaller.
1.0,I need to exchange.
1.0,They keep moving and it is difficult to get them to stay. I couldn’t use them without thinking they were gonna fall off.0
1.0,Very cute and the fabric is nice but the dress is enormous!  I ordered a small  - it fits like an extra-large.  Returning immediately.
1.0,Poor quality. But felt great for the first few days until they wore out. Dollar store quality.
1.0,I got the watched and really liked it. I took the plastic off the band and half the silver came off. Then 2 days later it doesn't keep time. Please don't waste your money.
1.0,This is NOT a real Cinesaddle. It’s a cheap Chinese copy. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,Horrible. Big gaudy and do not fit right. Do not buy
1.0,"Does not lay nicely like pictured, does show figure at all, I dont have a large bust but the pleats started on my boobs and it hung like a tent, poofed out terribly in front! I returned it"
1.0,I got my normal size which is 36C but with these it seemed like all six bras were a different size. The band on the bottom is super tight no matter the size and it rubs against my ribs and leaves a raw spot. Not comfortable bras.
1.0,After waiting longer for the item than expected the wrong size was sent. The material was cheap and uncomfortable and the color was off.
1.0,"It's a cute bracelet. The metal pieces are decent, but the elastic snapped apart at the wrist when tried to put on.  It is labeled as "" for adults"" but I bought this for my 12yr old. The finger loops are very small, cuts off circulation. turned her fingers purple."
1.0,"Loves this glasses but shortly after return period ended,they started to get super loose where they will fall off my face. Took them to get adjust a couple times and in no time they will get loose again. I contacted the company and it was a waste of my time they took forever to respond and they completely ignored my messages. I wish I knew they will only last me 30 days."
1.0,While the bracelet is very pretty and the claps was perfect this s bracelet turned my daughter green. I would not buy this again.
1.0,"The sunglasses that I ordered (black on black) with ROUND frame(aviator),  are NOT the ones I received. Yes they are flexible & polarized but just not the ones I wanted for my son.  No time for return either, going on vacation."
1.0,It was super thin and everything was off Center so I returned it.  My search word with a low profile and this thing looks like something out of the 1980s!
1.0,"After 1 wear, the blue is all faded!  It is now white!!!!!!!"
1.0,Shoes were cute but cheap quality I planned to keep them anyway until I wore them for an hour and had orange toes where the inside touched
1.0,"This item looks long in the photos. I am not tall. Only 5'6"", and this dress goes to the middle of my shins. Thats so annoying."
1.0,So this was a REPLACEMENT order because the previous one I got was just plain white skirt. I thought maybe the seller was confused so decided order a replacement instead of just returning. I still got the same exact plain white skirt. No floral print like the picture.
1.0,"Cheap quality, including the fabric. Returned the first set because of a hole in the pocket (never sewn all the way shut). The second set had strings hanging all over the seams, threatening to unravel. I didn’t bother to return it. Not worth the price of gas for a second trip to the UPS store."
1.0,The worst fabric and quality I have ever seen!  Actually threw it in the trash!  Wasn't worth the cost of returning it
1.0,They were wwwwaaaaayyyyy to long.  Went down to mid calf.  I am 5’9” and they were just not my style.
1.0,They broke after I wore them one single time!!! Poor quality. I wish I wouldn't have ordered them
1.0,See thru - weird fabric. Not at all as described
1.0,No me gustaro la calidad es mala y llegaro ya negras sin color
1.0,Not exactly what was described
1.0,The shorts are so short that even Richard Simmons would be embarrassed.
1.0,"The colors are as shown. But the material is cheap. It’s kinda shiny, and the fit is frumpy. I don’t like it. Haven’t worn it (or even touched it again after trying it on) since I got it, which has been like 8 months ago. Go with a size up, if you actually wanna get it after reading this."
1.0,When I first opened up the belt it looked very premium for the price. However that’s about where the good stops. I wasn’t able to use the belt therefor I can’t speak on longevity or durability. The ratchet mechanism is faulty in design. You ratchet the belt and then the slightest touch to the release lever causes the belt to loosen up. Just doesn’t work.
1.0,It isn’t sterling silver.
1.0,"CHEAP, poorly constructed and WASTE OF MONEY! The bill of the hat is defective, the logo is not center and it's not even the same color! Proof is in the pictures. I want my money back!"
1.0,The watch was dead when it arrived. Completely unusable. The watchband is a horrible mustard yellow. I took a chance thinking it couldn't be that ugly. It is.
1.0,"I returned this sweater as it was vacuumed packed. It said Dry Clean… it was so wrinkled that it could not be given as the gift I had purchased it for… or worn. Also said not to put it in the dryer, so I didn’t have that option to try and get the wrinkles out."
1.0,The shoe was a great product but does not fit true to size will not let me exchange said they would pay me 50% back  but they’re gonna let me keep the product I still would like to get the right size
1.0,Loved it when it came out of the package.<br /> with 2 delicate washes a button had fallen off.
1.0,cheap workmanship
1.0,Not the gloves shown in the picture.
1.0,Took a shot with these and initially I was very pleased. Comfortable and light weight due to composite toe. 6 months later however the souls are coming apart from the boot. The left heel has slid to the inside and the layers are delaminating. I don’t expect work boots to last forever especially in my line of work but at least a year would have prevented this review.
1.0,They went straight in the trash.  poor quality and came with scratches on them.
1.0,"Jacket I received did not look like pic as matter fact was completely different Jacket and it was too small too, sent it back, same day so glad I could, never received original jacket. Could’ve done a whole lot better then this!"
1.0,Nothing.  Should get my money back.
1.0,Waistband with two small and material does not stretch
1.0,The ear piece fell off the right side.
1.0,The shirt did not glow at all i couldn't write on it with the lil light that came with it the batteries was dead so hopefully the replacement i asked for will work out
1.0,Ok so I thought it was a light blue Jean jacket but it just a baby blue jacket not a Jean jacket it’s light fabric I ordered a medium and the sleeves are short usually I am a small but I wanted it baggy it’s very wide maybe for a short heavy person. Completely disappointed.
1.0,"OMG, can the strap be any shorter. An absolute waste of money"
1.0,"The outfit is not as described, felt like an ill fitted costume."
1.0,"Horrible! !! Cheap material, fit is all wrong!!!"
1.0,"It was supposed to be women earrings, but instead it looked like kids earrings,l would not recommend this item"
1.0,"The 2xl should have fit im 5"" 210lbs and this fit me like a small. Looked great on my 8 year old."
1.0,buyer beware.<br />clasp arrived broken after taking 2 months<br />have purchased similar belts that arrived on time and work fine.<br />shop for a different item!
1.0,I had a 5 00 watch that lasted 3 years.  This watch didn't last one day ..
1.0,The glare is terrible
1.0,Broke within a week. If it hadn't I would love it because it's cute. Instead I want my money back
1.0,"The dress was true to size and fit her great, however it was a MILE too long. I tried to pin it up, but pinning up so much length made it look horrible. The cape part is literally a FOOT longer than the length of the dress. I cut it to match the length of the dress, but it's just a cheap mesh and the ends were all jaggedy. My daughter had it on for a whole 20 minutes before trying to pull it off. The arms were too tight on her and where the dress connects to the mesh for the sleeves is very itch and uncomfortable. Came out of the package with the pin attached to the bodice, but the snowflake pendant wasn't attached to the pin. Complete waste of money and now I'm past the return window :("
1.0,Would have absolutely loved this if it was about 10-12 inches longer like in the description!
1.0,Charm fell off before I even wore it.  :(
1.0,This item was returned unopened. Did not use code. No where else to comment
1.0,The air filter broke after the first week and couldn’t get a hold of anyone
1.0,Not my order
1.0,Shirtis not true to size
1.0,"Bad material... and the beading is a picture, like someone ironed on a photo of beads onto the dress. Very very bad lol"
1.0,I was not happy
1.0,I ordered a large and it was way to big. Doesn't give u a figure it's just like plain straight and big... Ugh.
1.0,"These shorts ripped very easily.  They did not rip in a seamless location, or a high stress location either. This is the 2nd pair of shorts by this company I have bought that have ripped.  The fabric seems to just separate in places."
1.0,Had it one day it turned already.WOW.I GAVE IT ONE STAR IT'S THINK RIGHT SIZE BUT CHANGES COLOR TO QUICK.
1.0,I ordered a pair of these pants for my size. They arrived and were snug so I returned them and ordered a size up. That pair arrived and were smaller than the first pair.  Very poorly made with cheap fabric.
1.0,1 star because they broke within 2 weeks.
1.0,They are made way too small
1.0,"Size is more on the lower side of the measurement , cheap materials with no quality, came in amazon bag and indications that it was bent or folded. Looks good on photos only."
1.0,Wayyyy to big
1.0,These are very pretty however the stones fell off after one wear. Returning.
1.0,It kept coming apart on it own. I lost my keys because of this.
1.0,"Very cheaply made.  Cute, but falling apart after just a few we airings."
1.0,"Overall pretty disappointed in this wallet, a few months ago part of the snap came off and it has been unusual since. Ida Lane riding review because it wasn't a huge purchase but looking at it occasionally kind of annoyed me. I like the look and the feel of the product, especially as it aged and the leather softened and had kind of a distressed look. But I am surprised and seriously disappointed in the durability of the product."
1.0,This dress was ill fitting and unflattering. I’m normally a 12/14 and got the 2X. It was loose in some places(arms and shoulders)  and fit like a Medium in the bust/waist area. The material is itchy and smells weird like old people. It has no stretch and no breathability .
1.0,"way too small, no returns.  they only want to return 1/2 of my money."
1.0,Stupid. There's a seam running from the crotch to the v-neck - it has no slimming effect and draws attention unnecessarily to your midsection. I'm fit and I looked like a protruding blob in the Small.
1.0,"I didn't like this hoodie. It isn't cotton, my fault for not looking. It's polyester or some kind of synthetic horrible fabric. Don't buy it"
1.0,Material was horrible and very polyester looking. Shiny and sticky.
1.0,i got an extra large and it can fit an 8 year old....
1.0,Me parece que en las fotos se ve estupenda pero no es así en físico la tela no es de muy buena calidad
1.0,Cute but not easy to put in or stay in. The product kept falling out even though it’s threaded and was tight.
1.0,This is not for a regular size man or larger ... more for a kid or woman ... does not have a large band.
1.0,Las mangas son terribles casi puedo pensar que las cocieron late vez! Porque me pongo la blusa al revés y queda bien!!! Quise y pensé devolverla pero me quitan como $ 5 de lo que pague más envió o algo así! Es terrible así que la tengo guardada a ver si la arreglo. TERRIBLE COMPRA
1.0,"I returned for the following reasons:<br />1. Fit: it wa stop big and too long. I’m a petite and 5’ and this just didn’t work for my body shape.<br />2. Material: this was a polyester blend and semit-transparent, just not my style."
1.0,I ordered an 14 and got a 4 XL! Real cute if it were the right size.
1.0,"No frame included, don't buy it!"
1.0,Red Tundra came off in the first week
1.0,These pants seemed to run a little small.  The material is also really weird.
1.0,"Wow. I bought 9 pairs, 7 out of 9 pairs can’t even be worn. Whatever they’re using to coat the metal looks terrible. 1 earring out of every set looks completely different. This is ridiculous. Don’t even bother buying these."
1.0,These look really cheap and you cannot read the writing
1.0,"No nose clip, weird side pieces, and too small for adults and kids. Does not match description or photos."
1.0,"The handle broke the first time I used it, it's too small for my liking"
1.0,"I have had the belt for 2 months. I have not worn it very much. It is a GORGEOUS BELT, but look at the photos it is coming apart! The return window is closed. I think they should exchange it due to the poor quality !"
1.0,The skirt turned up missing one of the laces.  I went to return it but lockdown had just started so guess I need to find a lace so I can wear it now.
1.0,Don’t waste your money these bras Are horrible
1.0,This is a cheaply made product - the &#34;Flowers&#34; are just a muddy mess of color not really flowers at all.  I would not recommend this at all.
1.0,Terrible!!!
1.0,Returning it since it’s not at all the color or material as the picture.
1.0,"I brought this to take graduation pictures, and it came with a hole in it. So disappointing"
1.0,"too short, color like pepto bismal and a hospital gown would have been more form flattering"
1.0,broke by the second day of use made with cheap material but only paid 10 bucks can't expect much i suppose.
1.0,This belt is a joke.  The plate is about as thick as a few pieces of aluminum foil.  The artwork on the belt is very disappointing.  Avoid...unless it's for a Halloween costume or something that people won't care too much about.  This belt will not look good in a collection.
1.0,Very awful design. I guess it's my fault though bc I should have ordered directly thru mac's site. This thing sucks.
1.0,"Braclet to small. Asked for refund, got no response. Wife very petite and the bracelet won<br /><br />Bracelet to small, requested return, seller ignored my request. My wife is very small in stature and the bracelet will no go over her hand."
1.0,Nice shirt but very light material. Is see through
1.0,Not worth the money. But ok if it cost under $3.
1.0,Product way too small. A regular large would be a small with this product.
1.0,This items is not made well. The eye piece are not secured and kept falling out. I sent it back.
1.0,"Very cheap material and quality, i received 2 left foot boots, had to return"
1.0,"These headbands are of  extremely low quality. I took one out of the package and this was evident just by looking.  And they are too tight on me.  The stitching if that is what you call it, could have been done on a child's sewing machine.  This is not a material that will absorb perspiration well.  Do not waste your time or money with these cheap imitations.<br />I am sending mine back."
1.0,just buy a bandanna instead save your money
1.0,No era lo que yo esperaba
1.0,Way too small for an XL and did not appreciate having to pay $15 to send it back.
1.0,"Thought this was so cute, used the sizing chart to order a medium. It was so tight on my chest and it was so short that my crotch was about an inch from the bottom of the dress. Also, the seam of the top lays directly across your boobs. It was just a terrible design."
1.0,These are super tiny almost made to fit babies or toddlers
1.0,I'm returning after one use. The inner/outer snap that held the pouch fell out.
1.0,I  ordered this as a gift for a cat lover. When it arrived I immediately sent it back. The quality of the workmanship and material was so poor I was surprised that Amazon would market such a thing. There were no labels and no finished seams. It looked like it wouldn't make it through a washing. So disappointing!
1.0,Description is clear that it has pockets.  It even shows model with hands in her pockets.  THERE ARE NO POCKETS WHICH MAKE THE PANTS USELESS FOR OUR APPLICATION.  CANNOT RETURN DUE TO DAMAGE TO SHIPPING CARTON.
1.0,This item did not work as advertised.
1.0,These do not even come close to what the advertisement says they do. They are just amber colored glassses.
1.0,"The hem line goes right across your chest, way higher in the front than it is in the back. Unless you wear a size A bra - don't bother with this dress. Or maybe try ordering a size or two larger to compensate?? I do NOT recommend."
1.0,Cheaply made with no real footbed support
1.0,"They are mid-calf size, not knee-high."
1.0,Fit ok first time I put them on but once I washed them even in cold water they shrunk and would fit my 6 six year old but not me anymore.
1.0,"I bought this in the largest size available, ( with the suspicion that its made in China, and only fit a toddler)  and it is not only to tight,  its so short, literally half the length ...almost like a half shirt.  Very disappointed!"
1.0,Shoes were damaged  within 2 weeks of use . Also was giving out a pretty bad smell when my son was returning from school
1.0,"While initially I thought this was band great, six weeks in and the color coating is coming off. This is mostly where the magnet attaches but you can see from the other photos that it is happening all along the edge of the band. It is difficult to see with the photos so I circled the areas.  One of the little pins that you use to attach the band to the Versa also broke off and made getting the band off very difficult. The band is also not as shiny and bright as in the ad.  I guess you get what you pay for. :("
1.0,"It was hard and started to have pain, wearing for few minutes"
1.0,"I sent it back immediately, the size said Large but it was more like XXSmall. and it cost more to send back. I hope I get a full return on this.. Not a happy customer...No stars...will update if I get my money back..."
1.0,Don't do it!!! These lasted all of 3 wears. This cheap material. Way too small. Waste of pennies.
1.0,Side cut into skin and cups aren’t true size
1.0,"If you wear a large you have to order a small or a medium. But you rust the arm being too short.<br />I wear a large, this thing is like a blanket on me."
1.0,I purchased these and the Bows where already falling out of the hat & that was as I was taking them out of the packaging. Never again
1.0,Features and Details section claims that these glasses have a metal frame. This is not true. These glasses are 100% plastic.
1.0,"This bra looks nice however, the band was bothering me throughout the day and I didn’t think much of it since it was new. After taking it off I was left a decent sized mark where it had dug into my skin so much I bled."
1.0,size label on the leg left glue residue. Unable to get out. Returning at my expense. Would give zero stars if possible. Don't waste your time or money!
1.0,Returned one for month not working received replacement and would not work.  Don't recommend
1.0,Material is stiff and elastic in arm band is extremely tight. Very uncomfortable!
1.0,The emblem on the front of the shirt deteriorated after a half hour of him wearing it. It started crumbling and the fell apart.
1.0,"This was supposed to be a size 14 Large,  This was for an infant."
1.0,Loved this ban until it broke and I almost lost my watch. After 30 days I am no longer able to return defective item??!  What?!  Please reimburse me
1.0,"Don't buy this one! Bought this for our nephew for Christmas. He wore it once, and the letters started coming off before they even washed it! At least Amazon was great about refunding our money."
1.0,Received damaged item.
1.0,"While it was very cute, it fell out way too easy. Even when I’d reach up to just scratch my nose and bump it. Adorable for pictures but not for regular wear."
1.0,These belts are way smaller than what you think. My son couldn't get it close to going around his waist and he's a small size. I would have returned them if they weren't so inexpensive.
1.0,Ordered red but came in hot pink/fushia color. Guess they colorblind.
1.0,It’s ugly and way to big don’t like at all.
1.0,It came with a strap already broken and the bag was all folded so there’s permanent lines in the bag. Can’t even use…. Horrible. What a scam
1.0,Returned item. One pair would not charge and not turn on.
1.0,Really disappointed with this purchase
1.0,"Very beautiful, but broke on third wearing. Would like the company to replace it."
1.0,We  bought this umbrella for my son as a birthday gift in December 2018 he used it for the first time in  beginning of February 2019 and only used it 7 times and it broke on February 28th at school. He was opening it and umbrella shot open the spring somehow detached from the umbrella and handle! thankfully not hitting anyone or anything. We  spend a decent amount of money on this umbrella and the quality did not meet up at all. Total waste and not safe!! Will not buy this brand again!
1.0,Size not as described
1.0,"This top is very small, and see threw! I ordered off white and received white. It’s too much trouble to send back since it wasn’t on prime!"
1.0,"Fabric shop s cheap, fits too small, super short, not like in picture at all!"
1.0,Poor quality  My daughter only wore this twice and the button ripped out of the bib - ripping the fabric too
1.0,The earing arrived ontime and un s good package. However they broke as I tried to put them in my ears. The post came out and would not fit back in the earing. Frustrating experience. I would not buy these again.
1.0,I got a totally different costume!! So mad because it has glitter on the ears and I hate glitter! Plus it was walmart brand!?!
1.0,I literally just got the package. Opened it to try it on and the middle chain just popped . Smh . Disappointed .
1.0,When I bought these pajamas the description about the item said they were 95% cotton which is why I bought them. When I got them I couldn't believe they were cotton. When I looked at the tag there is no cotton in them at all. They are 95% Rayon. I double checked the description yesterday to see if I had misread it and it said 95% cotton. I see now today they have changed the description to say 95% Rayon. So if you want cotton pajamas don't buy these.
1.0,"I will be sending them back, trouble charging and keeping led on left shoe working consistently. The only time it works correctly is when you keep the shoe bent. It has to have a loose wire in there"
1.0,The opals do not match. One is cloudy white and the other is opal color.
1.0,Cheap texture and fabric.
1.0,This necklace last just a day.
1.0,The rhinestones continuously fall off.  I have even glued them back on with hot glue and they still fall off.
1.0,It’s just bad the sizing is wrong and the threads are loose
1.0,Was so small. Very disappointing
1.0,horrible is not like photho the materials is the worst exist in this planet
1.0,Sent them back!
1.0,Leather upper is nice. Soles and lining is very cheap and probably won't last through winter. Very disappointed. Would not recommend or purchase again.
1.0,Small. Bad tint. Built crooked not worth it. Now I have to deal with returning them.
1.0,Material was cheesy and it wasn't a good fit because it runs too small. This jumpsuit reminded me of a prison suit. I didn't like it at all.
1.0,Super Small! Like Comically So. Also they are stiff and cheap I’m every way. I would break these with the force it takes to open them!
1.0,"Not the best purchase but I guess it will do and my reasonings are as follows: firstly, the dress looks better online. Secondly, the straps are way too long and the dress is not true to size. It has a lot of stretch so for those who want a tighter fit size down."
1.0,"Not very good design, the lock accidently locked up, I end up throw it away."
1.0,"The blue stone fell  off hours of receiving the package. It’s a shame cause it is a good replica of DY, but not even worth the $11.00."
1.0,"Maybe they would fit without the lining but you can't remove it. Instead of returning, I donated them to a homeless person downtown KC."
1.0,"If I could give no stars I would, it doesn’t fit me at all it’s very small on me I usually wear a L and a lot of reviews say that it fits m/l so yeah I’d like to return it please thanks"
1.0,Material is no good
1.0,not flattering for a small figure
1.0,La tela es muy caliente y también transparente. Debería costar menos para la calidad que ofrece
1.0,"This has a horrible fit. Even though it has a slit in the back, it doesn't fit my head properly. I have a normal sized head, and have never had problems with masks before. This fits so tight, it makes your skin bulge. It also gaps where it isn't skin tight. Love the design, but it's pointless because of the horrible fit. It also doesn't lay around the nose correctly. Would never recommend this mask."
1.0,Broke one month after return window expired
1.0,Unfortunately the handle doesn’t align with the button that activates the lights/sounds. Also the chain for the pin broke off quickly as well. The lights and sounds stop intermittently and when the toy bounces off the carpet. What a shame.
1.0,They fit my leg which was a plus but I had to use tape to keep them from rolling down
1.0,I have had a Joe Boxer robe that lasted forever. Wife said it was getting thin. The new one is thinner and the sleeves are two different lengths by a little bit. Right arm not comfortable for some reason. But it's a robe I only use in the morning for an hour or so.
1.0,"Does not come with interchangeable nose piece, so I cannot wear them and seller will not communicate on what to do with them!"
1.0,It’s huge! Too big to wear
1.0,It says for thick women and it is for tiny woman. Im not a big person at all and I can't get them past me knees.  Too tiny for anyone
1.0,They are not as cute as they look
1.0,"This fit just right, it is not oversized as the picture and description indicate. The sweater came in a vacuum sealed package which may have effected the fluffiness of the sweater. The sweater was thin and did not give the appearance of a chunky and warm sweater. I am returning this sweater. So disappointed"
1.0,"Cheaply made, extremely narrow and small. Buy something else"
1.0,"WARNING; not as expected.  Once washed they shrink quite a bit.  They are not comfortable.  I saw a review by someone else that rated the item very low; however, I thought:  How could &#34;Fruit of the Loom&#34; make a defective cheap item?  I was wrong.  Poorly made.  Do NOT waste your money."
1.0,"I wanted to make my own yoga mat cleaner and loved the look of these bottles. Upon arrival, I loved the way they looked and they seemed very sturdy. Unfortunately, after less than a month, the sprayer clogged stopped working. My yoga mat solution only consists of water, witch hazel and essential oils.<br /><br />I submerged the sprayer head in hot water thinking it might clear the clog. It now sprays, but also leaks a considerable amount of liquid from the trigger making a mess and rendering the bottle useless.<br /><br />I’m assuming the essential oils are causing the clog, but also question this assumption because these bottles are advertised for essential oils.<br /><br />I wish I had read through the negative reviews, because this is clearly a common problem that others are having. It’s sad to see that the seller is not responding to the other negative reviewers and it doesn’t appear that they are offering replacements.<br /><br />I plan to reach out to the seller and will update my review if they respond and they’re willing to replace my sprayer heads."
1.0,Came broken. Ugly.
1.0,The clasp kept coming undone.  Ended up dropping brand new Apple Watch 4 and the face shattered.
1.0,This is a reasonable product but don’t buy as a gift!
1.0,3 came broken and 2 missing the ones I could use are definitely way to small
1.0,It doesn’t look like same material as the picture. Very cheap looking. Chinese size had to return it order 3X and more of medium size USA.
1.0,This shirt is bright yellow. It looks generic. Nothing cute like the picture. Don’t buy this
1.0,Not true it's size at all..... extremely too small
1.0,Earrings arrived with the pearls separated from the posts .<br />I tried gluing them back on but it didnt work. Total waste of money.<br />Don’t buy this junk.
1.0,I used the backpack only twice and it just fell apart - see the pictures. Very unreliable thing especially when traveling.
1.0,The extra material on top of the beanie stands straight up and doesn't look right .
1.0,They suck they shed to much
1.0,These glasses lasted one month and 3 days. Just long enough that it passed the return deadline!! They broke at the bottom of the lense. Flimsy and cheaply made. I have $2 glasses that lasts longer!
1.0,The fabric  looks and feels like plastic it has this weird shine.  Colors are also not as pictured-neon!!!. Hard to return and get a refund. Also  I have to wait until Feb 3rd to get my money back!!! Very disappointed. I am surprised this is sold on Amazon!!!!
1.0,fabric is not great
1.0,"I am really disappointed with this purchase. The zippers are such a low quality that you will want to replace them before wearing the jacket out in public. The jacket itself is cute, but not worth the effort to replace the zippers. It runs small, so size up if you want to take a gamble on the zippers."
1.0,Can't make out the distinct snake symbol.....very poorly made! A waste of money!  I don't think my wife has even added it to her bracellet!
1.0,Legit got an empty jewlery box... I lifted the foam and nothing was there... Lol I guess I will return my box since there is no option for a replacement.
1.0,"I ordered one size smaller as stated in ad but jacket was too tight in upper arms and across back. Sleeves very long with lining unsecured. I requested a refund and was given a shipping label but not free return. It looks like the cost to return will be near 30.00 and this was after finding out my 38.00 jacket actually cost 57.00, probably due to shipping.  I tried to cancel order once I realized the charges doubled and was told by email they would get back to me but no other response.."
1.0,These suck half of them break or are missing parts... the other half break while you wear them they are terrible quality but at pennies a piece what do you expect
1.0,"I was very, very disappointed with this product. I ordered the white, and it is so see through with you can see my skin tone (I am very light-skinned, so that’s saying something) and undergarments through it.<br /><br />There is no form to this dress and it looks dumpy. The only good part about it is the lace/sleeves, everything else is horrible.<br /><br />I would not ever wear this in public and will be returning it."
1.0,"Okay so when someone has a bad experience I usually just brush it off and order things anyway. I did so in this case, and it did not work out. So far 3 of the pairs have two different sizes. The 2g I ordered, and something smaller. They are beautiful, and the ones I can wear I love. But for 3 *so far* to not be wearable.... I would never have bought this."
1.0,even sized way up so it would fit my sweetie who has a 38” waist. these wouldn’t even fit me.
1.0,This is the worst item I have ever bought from amazon... I can't give this item no star or if I could I would...<br />Not happy at all<br />😠😡😠😡
1.0,This earring broke right when took it out of the package. I don't believe the quality of this specific design is done very well.
1.0,"For the price, I don't mind that it's thin, cheaply made, and the glow part is sort of painted on. What I can't forgive, is that only about half of the nickel sized space inside the locket glows. Apparently, it was just too much to ask to not see the metal shining through spots inside the small dot of glow paint."
1.0,"Scratches and scuffs and sticky resin like glue on the outside (cannot wash off with soap and warm water with paper towel). Air bubbles & air pocket holes all inside the plastic mold & it's unfinished the butterfly wing is exposed to the air on the purple side! VERY POOR QUALITY (SEE PICS) it's literally scratched an unfinished on the inside AND outside of both sides of<br />BOTH earrings, unbelievably crappy DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! Also the earrings had the post/hoop part had fallen off/away from the hoop it was on, easy enough to fix (but I shouldn't have had to). It makes me wonder if these had been returned after being used by someone else or if they were really just manufactured that badly to begin with..<br />Also not for nothing I ordered these on 2-day Prime I received them two weeks later long after I intended to give them as a gift which now I am glad her birthday passed better to give her nothing then hand her this crap. And when I finally received my box instead of having a great unpacking experience I was confused disappointed and not happy. Product Missing & Broken"
1.0,It looks like kindergarten arts and crafts
1.0,[[VIDEOID:72482e689ebc09877663d84b62283161]] The fasteners don’t fasten. I’m gonna have to return.
1.0,This is not the same dress lol the waist band isn’t like the picture and the sash just doesn’t sit right. Weird material too.
1.0,"Horrible! Complete crap , maybe it will fit my niece."
1.0,Very cheap. Looks like used stuff.
1.0,Not a case of 50 shorts as described!!<br />It is a plastic bag with 10 shorts!!
1.0,"Very disappointed as I only wore these twice before the back pin broke off. I was putting them on as the reviews said, pinching to make them stay and off it went. They looked really cute on so it is a real shame that I have to return them."
1.0,Did not get entire order. Still waiting on the necklace
1.0,"I ordered a size small, I’m 125 lbs and 5’4 and it was the length of a shirt and way to tight around my small chest. I gave it to my mother who is very tiny due to cancer treatment. I contacted the seller and they said they would refund me 50% and it’s been months and I haven’t received a refund at all. It would cost way too much to send back. I would reorder a large because it was really cute but I didn’t like the material, very bad for this Florida heat. Seems like it would be very itchy when sweating so oh well. I’m glad I was able to gift it to my mother. Definitely order at least 2 sizes up if you wanna wear as a dress."
1.0,Garbage ...the frame snapped so easily. Cheap plastics
1.0,To  smalll bad do not buy this
1.0,"If I could give less than a star I would. Dress fit as expected, but after one wear one of the straps tore and apparently my return window closed so now I can’t return or exchange it. Very disappointed."
1.0,"I'm 5'7, 165 lbs. Ordered an XL.<br />I have a Hanes XL shirt, under this one so you can see the difference.<br />This XL shirt is only 36"" around the chest.<br />It is only 23"" long.<br />The Hanes XL, under this one is 44"" around the chest & 28"" long.<br />It's 8 inches too small in the chest & 5"" too short in the length.<br />BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!"
1.0,"Do Not waste your time.. They are no good.. They came broken, they sent another one and the same thing.  Waste of my money!!!"
1.0,"Am Absolutely unsatisfied, with this item. In the process of returning.  Amazon dancing around the issue of sending a return label."
1.0,Did this mistake as soon as i got it in the mail and buddy 5 bucks later and i totally wasted it i couldnt get my anson belt off the damn track thingy off the line type inside of the hanger but it ended up braking but i saved my belt.
1.0,"This is not a cardigan sweater coat, this is a suggestive night gown thingy"
1.0,I got an 3 xl and it’s so small it would fit a child
1.0,These are not business card sized. They are much smaller
1.0,This was not what I expected. To me compression means like it would form to the body. This was just like an undershirt with no support around the belly.
1.0,"Received my order 11 days again, and already the chain broke.... super disappointed!"
1.0,"Ummmmm......well......its cheap! Get what you pay for. Cant even open it all the way,  to hard to push it in to lock it up."
1.0,"Sunglasses broke, only lasted a few months.  I just set them down gently and a piece snapped off the side.  Would not recommend."
1.0,in one day is broke
1.0,"Took absolutely forever to arrive like 10 days for PRIME and it's freakishly large in the arms. Looks like bat wings, I doubt it's even authentic it's that ridiculous. I could wear this for halloween. Now I have to PAY TO RETURN IT. Seriously?"
1.0,"Cups are very nice, and perfect for a large cup of coffee, except that 3 of them arrived broken. Makes for a pretty expensive cup when almost half cannot be used. A rare occasion when I am disappointed by Amazon, but this time I was."
1.0,Terrible wasn't what I ordered<br />Not even close no<br />Put them to the sun and not even dark at all
1.0,"So cheap looking, metal was also discolored in places. Sent right back."
1.0,Do not waste your money! The magnetic is horrible on these
1.0,It's a super cute shirt. But the santa iron on started to peel after the first wash. I will be returning..
1.0,"Charms fell off the first few days. Pretty, but not worth it."
1.0,"These are not at all what I expected. They fit so weird. The stretch is not great over the butt area. So when you do a squat you end up with the front waistline digging into your stomach and the back of the waist line almost to your crack. The waist of these is terribly uncomfortable. There is a 1"" elastic at the top of these that cuts into you at the slightest bend of the waist. It's aweful to look at. It makes me look bloated.<br />I bought my recommended size of medium. I weigh 141 and am 5'3"". I am not overweight. I don't know why these are so bad. I wasted my money. And I cannot even send them back because the package they came in is nowhere to be found."
1.0,It's plastic and it's easily torn. It's not worth the money I paid.
1.0,Ordered two dresses for my girls to take pictures in.. One came as the wrong size. We were going to make that work and then realized that the sash and flower weren't shipped with it!
1.0,"Don’t bother! I’ve been through two of them broken upon arrival! Junk chain, what a shame!"
1.0,"sizing is WAY off-I ordered TWO sizes larger than I normally wear, and they were still too small."
1.0,Got this for a friend and I felt ashamed to give her this. The material is the cheapest thing ever. It's something I would expect from a dollar store... Don't ever wear this...
1.0,The color in the picture is not the same what I have received
1.0,lo solicite hace más de un mes y no a llegado
1.0,"Bought on prime day a while ago, received the glasses pretty late and they were missing a scew.  Ear pieces were decidedly uneven, took a little bending to look normal.  Ended up breaking about a month later near the nose."
1.0,NOT SCREEN PRINTED!!! Decal cracked and began to peel after two dozen washes.
1.0,Hurts my nose and falls off my head. Poorly made. Cheap.
1.0,Dress fit really tight around the arm and bust area! If you purchase please buy a size up I'm a small
1.0,I ordered a gold one and I got a silver on so they ordered another in gold
1.0,"This is NOT the item I ordered, I would like the item as shown in the picture and I am very disappointed."
1.0,Fell apart within minutes
1.0,Terrible - gives you a headache
1.0,Definitely NOT lead free/nickel free! After a couple hours of wearing it my neck was broke out because I’m allergic to nickel. Do not buy if you have a sensitivity.
1.0,Couldn't get them to stay closed. They kept falling out my daughter's ears. It's not all of them that does that. I have ordered so many and every once and a while I will come over a pair like this.
1.0,This would be a five star review except the zippers! Your main zipper is next to impossible to start which really feels foolish when you are trying ten times to zipper up your jacket. All the other zippers require tension from one hand and zipped with another even for small adjustments. If this issue could be resolved I am happy with the shell quality fit and comfort. I unfortunately was excited and wore this to work before I really discovered how bad the zippers were. I would not purchase this until the manufacturer can correct this major flaw.
1.0,The sticker was placed over the size. I will not order fro you again. Poor quality. Cheap material and not as described on website.
1.0,Poor quality. Does not look like the photos.
1.0,I do not recommend..very strange fit.
1.0,"Cheat looking, did not meet expectations"
1.0,Not good quality.....not worth sny money. Item csme stratched in two places. not worth my time to send it back
1.0,"While these leggings looks good on at first, and they have good tummy control- they are NOT squat proof at all. Any bend & you can see through them easily. How embarrassing.<br />I’ve been trying different brands out looking for good quality so you might see this review a couple places 🙄"
1.0,Not Vegan. This is leather.
1.0,"It's horrible. Like jewelry that children okay with. Actually, I ended up letting my daughter play with it since it was so ugly and bulky and within 2 minutes it was broken because its made out of plastic. I bought it for a date night, and expected it to be worth the money. I don't have time to shop in stores, but ended up buying a nice lovely necklace - for the same price. This is a horrible rip off. It's plastic, it breaks extremely easy and its NOT worth the money. Seriously, 50 cent jewelry from the gum ball machines is what it is. Beware before you buy."
1.0,"The items received were magnets not keychains. As this was sent as a gift, returning it is a hassle."
1.0,"It didn't work well for my sublimation project. I have used 100 percent polyester in projects before and it has worked perfectly, but for some reason not with this bag.<br />Very disssapointed.<br />Also, it looks cheap."
1.0,"The quality of the socks are fine, but they do not keep my feet warmer than any other socks; therefore they are well over priced."
1.0,"Far too small. I wear a 1 x. Ordered a 5x. My cousin is a large, and it is snug on her."
1.0,"It’s really cheap and that’s what caught my eye. But when I put one on and it kept  getting caught to my clothes, especially when I carries my newborn, it kept getting caught to her onesies too. And it’s really cheap looking."
1.0,Cheaply made. Get what you pay for. Very thin and not a durable material at all
1.0,"Disappointed in the durability of the straps. Used it twice and on the second grocery trip I had only two cans, some pasta and veggies and the strap broke at the rivets. Maybe a defective unit, but very frustrated it didn’t last more than twice."
1.0,I was barely able to get my feet in them. They where two sizes smaller than what they should of been.
1.0,"Ridiculously cheap made, can’t get some of them open. Do not buy.  They will go in the garbage if I can’t return them."
1.0,Poorly made. The zipper has broken so I sent for a replacement and within a week the zipper has broken again. Don’t bother purchasing
1.0,They were broken.
1.0,Dress is too wide at lower portion
1.0,I ordered based on the color and it is not even close
1.0,"Felt very plasticy, slippery. Returned."
1.0,"I bought it for my girlfriend, it fits perfect BUT the red tie is missing, seriously?!! I mean seriously, i can give you 5 stars but NO. I was expecting the complete dress."
1.0,Too small....no stretch....Asian sizing/cut.<br />Beautiful dress but cut not as anticipated....sigh
1.0,"The first time i ordered this, i followed the size chart to the T. And it was too small. I has to return it and order another one, that one came and was a completely different size. Had to return that one as well. I was told that this item would be expedited to get here on time, and when that arrived, it was the same size they got wrong. This is the worst product I’ve ever had to deal with. By the time i went through all the return and exchange processes, and having to go out of my way to take the returns, it was pointless. The event i needed it for had passed. I’m extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. I’ve never had this issue. THREE issues for ONE item. This is not okay."
1.0,"looks ok, but very small"
1.0,"For the price, this was a disappointment and a return to China very spendy.  Cheap material and it looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,"Great look. Very poorly made. The shoe fell apart while I was walking in my home, strutting across my hardwood living room floor. I had high hopes for these… sooo disappointed"
1.0,Great fit and looks great however seam ripped open during hand wash which the garment bag says to do
1.0,The gromets were pulling away frim the material.  Strings were then ripping through.  Very cheaply made
1.0,"I expected a soft leather blazer, not a floppy loose sweater. I returned it the very same day. I'm not sure why it hasn't cleared yet."
1.0,"No matter how I tweaked the knobs, my vision was still blurry!"
1.0,"Terribly hard to get on & off, didn’t fit as it looked in the picture. Was NOT cute on! It was very short waisted-I looked square with side ruffles. I’m tiny & it still was too hard to get into.  I returned it."
1.0,"Had to throw away right away. Arrived very uneven, crooked. Looked like they had been sat on before shipment"
1.0,"Haven't used it yet, but was very impressed with the quality for the price!  Looks much more expensive!"
1.0,Nothing like displayed. Sent it back because It's way too big and fits nothing like advertised.
1.0,Way too small! I ordered a size up to be safe and it was still too small. Slim fit is an understatement. Also the seller makes it nearly impossible to return.
1.0,It stated that they were black but looked more like navy blue
1.0,The product itself is pretty cool for that 30 seconds before they break. Great size for 4-10 yr olds.  I bought these as a gift but came with 0 packaging - just wrapped in bubble wrap so I had to come up with packaging. My son played with it and took a swipe at the couch cusion playing. 2 claws snapped right off.  The more I think about it the angrier I get. Total joke don't waste your money.
1.0,"The 2XL I ordered wasn't true to size. I order 3 shirts L, XL and 2XL for my family. The 2XL doesn't fit me and they don't have any size bigger. We planned to wear them to eh IFC event in my home town. So now I will be the only one with a different shirt design because I have to get a different shirt. 😔"
1.0,This is a kids hat......... it is not meant to fit on a adult head.<br />Printing on hat is off center.<br />This was cheap......($12)<br />You get what you pay for.
1.0,"Not at all true to size, I could not post without giving is a star. My advise is to go to the store and try it on."
1.0,"The saying, &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; absolutely applies here. I got the largest size available and what came in the mail looked like a g-string. Not worth wasting your time."
1.0,Color wasn’t nice and there was no him
1.0,There are black splotches or dots all over the screen printing right out of the package
1.0,"I am 5' 8"" and the pants were too short."
1.0,Very nice looking .. BUT stone was not even in earring bracket when opening up box-BROKE  and Poorly made!
1.0,Dress material is similar to low end stiff material used in disposable surgery scrubs including green color. Does not look like picture. Lowest end material.  Tried to wash to soften and shrank several sizes.
1.0,"Dress was described a stretchy fabric. It’s NOT stretchy. I might have been able to get it on if it had a zipper in back. If you are capable of  wrangling into inflexible clothes, the red fabric was a pretty color. But at my age with old shoulders, I can’t put on a dress that isn’t stretchy. I returned. This could have saved me time and money if the fabric was described correctly. The fabric is best described as a soft with no stretch, just like a table cloth."
1.0,Would of loved it more if the design wasn’t upside down.  Otherwise very cool mask!
1.0,The quality of this shirt sucks!! Its very see through.There's a few holes in the shirt.I ordered a 3x for my mom.And what i got did not look like a 3x ..  I normally wear a xl and this shirt didn't fit me.. This 3x looks like it would fit a girl who wears a large not a 3x
1.0,"Ring seemed nice, shiny and pretty. However the little hinge on it continued to catch in my nose piercing hole cutting it and irritating it.The piercing started to puss and I could not get the hinge to open. I've had my nose piercing for two years and never had a problem like this before. Ended up having to cut it out of my nose."
1.0,The bridge piece on both mask have come off and and no longer fit properly with the filter in them. I like the concept but the execution not so much.
1.0,"For $10 more, I could have had a far better quality costume. The hat looks ridiculous on my kiddo's head. It doesn't fit right at all, and the brim of the hat either lays flat against his face or flips up and looks stupid. IDK what they were thinking about the mustache. It's like 2.5"" tall which completely covers his mouth, and the tiny adhesive strip is in the middle which puts it on his bottom lip. The strap on the ""overalls"" came unglued the second he tried it on, so I've gotta glue that back on.  Would not recommend at all unless you're in a pinch. This is definitely a onetime only last resort sort of costume. Amazon carries other costumes for just slightly higher price that are way better. I should have just gone with that one. I would say you get what you pay for, but I paid $20 for this and it's worth maybe $5."
1.0,Doesn't work with fine hair.  at all.
1.0,These are a full size or size and a half small
1.0,"Would not stay clasped, kept falling off wrist"
1.0,This product is of very quality I am very disappointed it looks like leotard material I can see right through it.
1.0,"This is not cotton or bamboo. I can't speak for all the colors and styles listed but this one is some terrible shiny nylon spandex material that runs VERY small. The material doesn't breath at all. Get it if you want to be warm or hot all the time.<br /> It doesn't have ties to even attempt to keep it closed if it did fit properly. If you want open and 'flowy' you might like this. I needed something that closes.<br />  The one positive was it did indeed cover my rear. I'm 5'8 if that helps at all to be 'safe' got the XL, lol."
1.0,"The top of this dress is so very narrow. It’s almost as if it was personally tailored for someone who has absolutely no chest. Very confusing dress. I loved the color and the material was nice. But overall, the dress made absolutely no sense."
1.0,Literally looks nothing like the picture very cheaply made. Guess you get what you pay for
1.0,It broke as soon as I got it. The tree of life charm fell off
1.0,The bracelet fell apart while I was in bed.......
1.0,Not real opals
1.0,"Terrible terrible terrible. Material is see through, no stretch and not flattering. Very cheap looking.  Also, I'm 5' 7&#34; and the medium was about 4 inches above the floor. Waste of time and money."
1.0,The watch looks amazing except it is cheap!!!! I mean cheap. The minute hand spun freely and was about to fall off. If they were not made so cheap this would be an amazing watch
1.0,"I wanted to love these things. The look is excellent. But even for my narrow feet, these are too narrow to wear. Super uncomfortable."
1.0,I see no difference when wearing these. Maybe they're too cheap and you need to buy more expensive glasses. idk.
1.0,El plástico es muy duro y incómodo para mí oreja creo que sería mejor si fuera elástico y no de plástico el ajuste
1.0,"I was so excited about this purchase ---- until I received it!  Then disappointment set in!  The bracelet was very well boxed but that's about the only good thing I can say about it.  It was broken when I took it out of the box.  After inspecting it I found that it was VERY light-weight so I'm not sure it would've lasted very long anyway.  However, I did love the design! And returning it was very easy......I waited a little longer than I thought was necessary but did finally get my credit."
1.0,they broke and I dropped them once on the grass
1.0,The emblem and the font size are unbelievably small. It is impossible to know what the hat actually says. Disappointing purchase
1.0,"Since this is a gift for my son and daughterinlaw that are having their 1st child for the nursery furniture.  I have not seen it , do I can’t review it."
1.0,"What the heck!!!!!! This little piece of crap is NOT what I ordered!!!! Nothing at all as described, not cotton, some weird plastic fabric. Not same AT ALL. FURIOUS!!!!"
1.0,Couldn’t tell what size.  I always buy clothes so they recommended it to me.  Came in xa
1.0,the zirconia side also unscrewed.
1.0,This should be sold as a kids size seriously. I ordered an XL and the pants would not even allow one leg in there. It looks like a child size pants and they should not be listed as regular sizes. I would not recommend anyone purchasing these jeans. I just gave them to Goodwill because it was a hot mess.
1.0,Does not look anything like the picture.  Was very disappointed.
1.0,Fabric is not silky or soft. It's a stiff synthetic that wrinkles very easily.
1.0,I bought this chain twice for my granddaughter. The chain is so weak it broke both times. Really disappointed.
1.0,The flag says “Patrisk’s” Day.
1.0,You definitely get what you pay for. I just threw them away. The lenses were so distorted that it gave me a headache. Don't waste your time.
1.0,"The case itself is amazing, but the smell is unbearable!!!!! Enough to be embrrrased to actually use this product. So disappointing 😭 it smells extremely chemically. Could not use."
1.0,"I read the reviews for this and must have received a different product. The dress I got was not the color pictured, I got charcoal gray but it was light gray. It was extremely short, I am talking knee length not just a couple inches. The fabric is not good quality and the construction is inadequate at best but I would describe it as awful. I am done buying clothes from amazon. I don't know what anyone who gave this dress a good review recipe but I got a waste of my money and a piece of junk I might be able to use to sleep in"
1.0,"This did not look like the picture at all. Horrible, don`t waste your time or money."
1.0,It broken when I tried to put them on
1.0,"Got a kids size apparently and no carbon filters, big disappointment 😔"
1.0,Item was too small of a top for the bottom that was made the item suck advise you not to buy
1.0,"Loved it at first, but it isn't sterling! Finger turned green in like 30 mins and I wear several sterling rings on a daily basis. Bummer!"
1.0,"Just like pictures of everyone else, mine fell apart at the string tie area and the stitch on the side.  Cheaply made. I am super sad because they are long enough 😪 but falling apart.  1st time wearing them."
1.0,It comes with an awful smell I can’t get out even after two washes...
1.0,These shorts tore within one month of used and washed regularly. Go with an actual athletics brand.
1.0,Terrible. Would never buy again.
1.0,"Shipping was fine. Product looked wonderful as pictured .<br />But first time worn multiple stretch bands started snapping,second time worn at the end of the night completely fell apart after taking it off."
1.0,Over half of these masks didn’t have wire in them to fit the nose.  So I had to discard them because they didn’t fit.  Do not buy.
1.0,NOTHING like the picture!
1.0,"Absolutely not for women with large hips! I'm in the process of trying to lose weight and decided to try these out for workout shorts. As you can see on the pics, they are not flattering at all if you've got wide hips. The panels don't even touch on the sides!! Just another disappointment for me. The material is soft & comfy though so that's a plus. I'll put them away in the ""maybe one day"" drawer with the rest."
1.0,"I had hoped these shoes would be keepers, but they are too wide,clunky and have no arch support. Too bad, so back they went."
1.0,The gauge is way too large.  I searched for 18.  Didnt realise I got 14 gauge until it was too late.
1.0,Shirt is not tshirt it’s a silky feel type shirt also runs a little big so u might want to downsize & wear something under because it’s very thin (see through) hope this helps the next person
1.0,"This suit does not fit on either the top or the bottom.  Oddly enough, the top is too big and the bottoms are too small.  I'm a little top heavy, so this doesn't usually happen."
1.0,Is this yellow on the picture? I expected blue t-shirt like on the picture. But I got a yellow t-shirt. Another kind.
1.0,Wrong shape looked nothing like pic
1.0,Muy decepcionada.  Tomé mis medidas y pedí el artículo según las especificaciones de la tabla y el vestido resultó demasiado grande.
1.0,Very unsatisfied. This product should have been advertised in the infant section
1.0,"Several Blemishes on upper straps , for this much money there should be a a A-1 , not in lame terms Each Item Is Uniquely Hand Printed , No its poor quality. Left side has letters going up sharks face Rights Reserved"
1.0,I quit using the bands after the watch fell off of my arm several times. It comes unconnected. I am sorry I didn't figure this out between the window of return.
1.0,Smaller then what the size say
1.0,This frontal sheds like crazy! If you even attempt to use bleach to bleach the knots the hair will fall out everywhere. I had to end up ventilating my frontal so it wouldn't go to waste. Won't be buying again
1.0,The material was poor quality and it didn’t last long before my zippers ended up breaking. I’ve had better quality bags.
1.0,"I thought these bifocal readers would be a little better quality than your typical cheap readers, especially since they were $15.99 for one pair. I've paid ten bucks for a pack of three non bifocal readers at the local Dollar General in the past and they usually don't last very long and that's expected. But, these aren't any different. Very cheap materials and the screws keep coming loose and now they're stripped out and won't tighten down. Terrible product, not even worth $5."
1.0,Poor. Quality
1.0,The piece was bigger than I expected for the price. Turns out it is fake. Definitely made in a mold.
1.0,Not gold at all like the pictures looks very cheap and obviously nothing like the pictures
1.0,for 36.99 the quality couldve been better. i take out the sweater to wear and lo and behold there is a big hole under the armpit!!! thanks for ruining my ugle sweater day
1.0,I had it less than a month and it broke without even getting caught on something. Very disappointing.
1.0,I was hoping the shirt would be longer in length but it’s not and the fabric doesn’t breathe.
1.0,Cute design but it didn't fit
1.0,"Washed it like the tag said, it went from XL to XS.  Worst item I ever bought."
1.0,Stiff belt and Chincey Plastic buckle.
1.0,"I trashed both aprons, because it had the worse smell that smelled toxic. There is no way anyone can wear it. Poor quality product."
1.0,The dress arrived with a large stain on front. It went onto the lining. It was also very stretched out either from someone wearing it or hanging up too long. It was a beautiful dress. I wish it was in better condition. It did arrive very fast and the return was immediately approved.
1.0,"I was hoping I could use to keep things from closing, but it hurt with the way my stomach was stretching.  The ring isn't as bendy as they make it look."
1.0,Did not like how long it took to get this not comfortable!
1.0,Cheaply made. The boot scuffed after a few minutes of wearing. Only got one time wear out of them.
1.0,Shocked by how small this was. I order lots of clothes online and this was shockingly small
1.0,"These pants are terrible. First off, they say they are black and white striped but they are definitely navy blue. The navy blue stripes looks almost like the color bled out and resembles th look of stonewash. Also the material is not appealing, almost like swimsuit material. Not my idea of &#34;comfy lounge pants&#34; as it states. They came out of the box and went right back in to be returned."
1.0,So thin! Very small fitting and oddly made.
1.0,Cheap item it is already broken unbelievable !
1.0,"Great idea, poor use of money.<br />Go to direct sites like the Red Cross or Catholic Charities or.... there are many well-known and established charitable sites that well put MORE of your money DIRECTLY to good use.<br />I suppose something is better than nothing, but why do we need to GET something in order to give?  To show off our pride in what we are giving?  Give it all, and smile inside knowing without the bag you are feeding x amount more kids."
1.0,I received my necklace in the mail on 9/24. By 9/29 my skin is already reacting to the cheap metal and turning green. If you plan on wearing this for any real amount of time I dont recommend this one.
1.0,Hoped I’d luck out & get a good one ( - after reading thru the recent reviews.)<br />  But no luck - it worked fine the initial days.<br />  Had it attached to an (internal) purse zipper; didn’t reference often.<br />  Was going to recommend to a friend - but pulled it out to show & it had stopped running.  SAD…
1.0,"Skin allergic to material, broke out in rash the first day I tried it."
1.0,This hat broken one week
1.0,Fits stupid lol cheapy shirt and its super short and really wide
1.0,To start they look like crap... Never would have got them don't waist ur time or money
1.0,Broke within 5 minutes of my daughter wearing it. Really cute bracelet in itself but not tied well.
1.0,This product broke as soon as I placed it on the ring!! I looked up ring guards for men rings and this came up but it was flimsy and fell apart!!! I am very disappointed 😑
1.0,"These earrings are so cute, but they arrived broken. The lever back was completely loose on one earring and not connected on the other. They were thrown in a box, with the plastic bag loose so whoever packed this knew that they were defective.<br /><br />An update to my review: I reordered these earrings and again they came the same way. BROKEN! The leverback was completely loose on one earring. I see all the positive reviews so I'm wondering why I keep getting the defective earrings."
1.0,Bracelet was tarnished when I received it.
1.0,My 18” necklace only measures 17.5”!  I would have given 5 stars but I was shorted on the length of the necklace.
1.0,the face masks are too small for the face. The eyes shield are hard to see through and 2 of them are bent and cannot be fixed.
1.0,I only got one ring and I thought by it saying one pair that I was going to get both in one pair..I wasted 4 dollars on 1 ring...really
1.0,Looks like a women's jacket on shoulders puffy. Great women's jacket but not for boys
1.0,Unreal how non user friendly this is. Do not buy.
1.0,"I dislike everything about this shirt. I wear it under my work scrubs or as Night shirt. It’s too ugly/cheap looking to wear in public. The heart on the front of the shirt is a weird, ‘spray heart tattoo from the county fair’ kind of heart. It’s not at all tasteful or cute. Not even a little bit. The heart on the front ruins all expectations of the entire shirt."
1.0,"The ones on top have bent brims, shipped in a bag. Very low quality and it shows"
1.0,Dress was not what I expected I would not<br />recommend it
1.0,"I want to love it but I've ordered two in different sizes and while the tags say they are different sizes they are the exact same size! I don't think it matters what size you buy, you're going to get an XXS no matter what."
1.0,Solid plastic not breathable doesn’t look like photo
1.0,It’s trash don’t buy it. And with Covid and this coming from china it takes weeks to arrive with no tracking info. I actually forgot I ordered it. But it’s complete garbage. Just don’t buy it.
1.0,Worst grill ever it tarnished in hot water and lost 6 diamonds on top and bottom combined this is junk I don't even want my money back I'll charge it to the game don't buy this junk sorry
1.0,These are very uncomfortable and hurt the bottom of your tongue! I can't wear them.
1.0,Rusted in 6 days ☹️
1.0,Returned first product because would not snap open - even with a lot of force.  Certainly a child couldn't<br />open it.  Received a replacement in quick time but had the same problem - would not consistently snap<br />open.  Had to return it for a refund.
1.0,Make sure you know it only comes 1 to a package before buying!
1.0,Was way smaller than I expected. Am returning it.
1.0,Entirely to small.  Ordered based of the measurements listed on the page and those weren't accurate at all. Contacted owner and got a dollar refund. Buyer beware.  Order 3 sizes up and take a chance
1.0,Very flimsy material. See thru. Runs small
1.0,Way shorter than it looks. I’m 5’3 and it barely covered me
1.0,Way too small and they are cut weird.
1.0,Very thin and cheap.
1.0,Another cloth in Asia Size. I tried L (normally M is fine) but no chance to get inside.<br />I ordered XL. So I would say 2 size bigger. I will revise my comment after trying another size.<br />The prize is to high. It is a usual low quality Asia product. They profit from The Name Tesla (Car) obviously which is also too expensive haha.
1.0,"Definitely does not go up to an xxl. Super disappointed, as I bought this brand of leggings before and the size was perfect."
1.0,"The glue began to separate on my third day of wearing this belt. I'm a bigger guy, so my belly tends to ride on the belt and be somewhat harder on them than a weaker, smaller male. Unfortunately, this belt wasn't nearly up to snuff."
1.0,Tiny!  Not shiny or pretty as pictured - returned
1.0,"i bought 2 for my grand-babies one is 2 the other is 4 years old, the top for the 2 year old fit the 4 year old, The bottoms both fit them. I had to have the shirts took in and a bow added to the back."
1.0,"I am 5'7"" tall this hits me mid calf. I normally wear size 10-12 USA.  I ordered a size XL because I wanted a roomy fit. It is ridiculously small."
1.0,"I was really excited when I got this in the mail. It looked stylish and seemed sturdy. However, my wrist is small and this bracelet did not tighten enough for me to wear it without it sliding around everywhere. Even worse, after wearing it for about two weeks, it broke! I was tightening it and the string broke apart. Cheaply made!"
1.0,"I bought a pair in black. Nice cut, nice linen BUT they are very, very see-through. I can actually see my skin through the material. They'll work as pajamas, but not for out in public."
1.0,These are not for a woman. It is for a one year old. I am very disappointed. The purple is very light in color. When it says small it means very small.
1.0,"The ribbons on the hat are a bright teal/green color, NOT blue as pictured and described.  This will not work for the costume I purchased it for."
1.0,Awful.  Paper thin and 3 sizes to small.
1.0,Bought these to replace a beloved pair of slippers that lasted 30 years. These didn't last 30 days.  Buy something else.
1.0,"These earrings were impossible, the hooks were so messed up........One side was so tight you can't open it.  The other so loose you couldn't close it.  I threw them away......"
1.0,"to small and too short, I am a size 10 so I ordered the large, it never stated a length  so I just took a chance, returned them ASAP as soon as I got them"
1.0,Do not buy your size buy 2 above at minimum
1.0,"My mother saw these as an add on to her Totes slippers that she wanted , only to find these to allow her foot to slide through the band across the toes causing her to be fearful of falling in them"
1.0,Dress is not close to what photo looks like. Cheap work/product
1.0,"I bought this during Covid, in July 2020.  I never got to use it because we couldn't have gatherings.  I had my first gathering this last month and one corner of the umbrella is bent and looks like it may break.  I cannot return it because it is past the return time.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"Arms very thin, for a size 4 or so. Just cut badly. Not wearable."
1.0,I ordered a large and it still didn't fit as comfy as I expected. I couldn't wear it with leggings either.
1.0,Not satisfied. The material is very flimsy (soft) meaning it’s not the fitted cap I expected
1.0,Definitely didn’t work lik it stated if u hav a stomach look else Wher
1.0,Very disappointed. This shirt is super thin and the material is cheap. It’s one of those blouses you find on the $3.99 Walmart clearance rack.  I have two other Sonja Betro blouses and the quality is far superior.
1.0,"Very disappointed, not a sweatshirt at all. Very thing tee shirt material"
1.0,This product was tested for conductivity by a qualified technician with specialized tools and failed. I claim that it is not the product advertised.
1.0,Broken when I received the earrings. Cheap looking!
1.0,Did not receive. Missing in package
1.0,"I couldn't wait to wear these earrings.  I knew that they were not going to be great quality (paid less than $10) but I was hoping to wear them at least.  The post requires to be pull away, unbent, to be able to place in the ears.  Once I gently pulled the post, about 3mm, the post broke off.  Bummer."
1.0,"Not really a fan of these. I ordered 2 sets because of the price but I should have known better.  The material is soft, which I like, but the head bands are paper thin and I don't think it will do any good in keeping ears warm.  I am returning these."
1.0,Do not buy left a mark on one of my breast
1.0,I am a size XL.  I ordered this top in an XL.  It was too small.  I sent it back and ordered a 2X.  Perfect!  NOT.  I wore this ONE TIME and it was a nice fit.  I threw it into the washing machine with my regular dark clothes laundry.  IT CAME OUT LOOKING LIKE A DOLL'S TOP.  I am sending it to Goodwill in hopes that there is a second grade girl that can use it.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"The description clearly states 80% cotton 20% polyester. Guess what......they lied! There is no cotton to be found in this Rosebud Motel t-shirt. It's 65% polyester 35% spandex and it looks and feels flammable! It has a horrible sheen to the fabric and it drapes on your body highlighting every bump and bulge. It feels like that silky athletic type material, only it makes you hot and sweaty, like you're wearing a plastic garbage bag! I am just so annoyed with manufacturers peddling misrepresented junk on Amazon! Hard pass on this t-shirt! Spend your hard earned money elsewhere! Send a message to these online retailers that we demand better!"
1.0,Did not work at all........
1.0,"Pins not a good fit. The new Pins that came with the new band keeps dropping out. My old ones are too big for this new band, so I'm stuck."
1.0,"Its so cheap, maybe worth $1. Fell apart the second they put it on. Such a bummer"
1.0,This bra is too tight and there is no padding at all. It’s like a training bra with an underwire.
1.0,Lettering was to small and not centered
1.0,"The short set looks to be made very cheap, and does not fit true to size. I'm sorry but going to return."
1.0,The fabric is nice but it dis NOT come with the brooch as advertised. I'm a quite disappointed by that. If I had thatb this would have been a 5 star.
1.0,"This is the worst product I’ve ever seen! First off I only got one item, not a set. I call it an item because it is not a glove. It’s a piece of fabric with a light on it. Complete junk & nothing like product shown."
1.0,The vest is just a outter thin fabric with a zipper for a lining .BUT no white lining as pictured<br />RIP off
1.0,Ridiculously small.  Seemed pretty cheaply made.  Returned.
1.0,"Terrible goggles, super blurry underwater, do not buy"
1.0,"The chain came broken and the butterfly pendant won't come off of the chain because of the way it is made. It looks cheaper than what I purchased it for and because it came broken, the price point is wrong (should sell for even less) and the gaudiness of the pendant cannot be classified as a statement piece, unless the statement refers to something other than the buyer possessing a modicum of taste.  Largely disappointed in this purchase for the most part.  I will not buy from this vendor again....not because of how the necklace actually looked in person, but because of the quality of the materials used to make it.....really, really cheap."
1.0,"I got a larger size than normal for my son due to the specs on this site. My son is bigger, stockier than the average 8 year old and he’s swimming in This shirt. It looks like a dress. The shirt is polyester, not cotton which I am not happy about. My son likes the shirt though so I did not return it"
1.0,Poor poor poor quality hat do not even sit here right material is very cheap no way worth the price they’re asking should be sold for  $4.99
1.0,Not what picture shows
1.0,"The post were bent, having to return product."
1.0,Broke when I opened it. Returned item
1.0,A little small for a sz 18. And sits below the waist a little bit. Sent it back.
1.0,This dress was super cute and comfy then the first time I washed it— delicate in cold— I hung it to dry and the length shrunk so much I could almost wear it as a shirt :/
1.0,Dress is far smaller than size ordered 2x fit like it might have been a lg
1.0,"Got the blue unicorn and initially was very happy with it! It is soft, fit great and comfortable. The pockets were awesome too.... Nonetheless the first time I went to unzip the back, the zipper broke... I literally had it on for 5minutes! Now I can't wear, because the back is just too opened... Disappointing..."
1.0,Too small. Cheaply made. Not worth it at all.
1.0,"At first, I loved them. But within a month of wearing them 2x a week they started to break down. Little strands of elastic started sticking out along all the seams. Now totally unwearable."
1.0,Sized super small & the metal was not properly filed
1.0,not elastic enough to stay on
1.0,"Sorry this is NOT what I was expecting. Material was thin, wrinkled and unflattering. Oh well the search for my gala dress continues."
1.0,"Too small, I ordered a size 2. On the tag size 13 is marked off in pen and 2 is written in."
1.0,"Very disappointed with the poor quality of this cheap item. It did arrive during the timeline they promised. It was however enscribbed with the words I love you ( not pictured) I don't like this!  Also, this metal is not silver and is extremely thin !"
1.0,"The first time I used the product, it broke. Within an hour the pin was still attached to my name badge and the watch itself had fallen off. I never found it.."
1.0,"The title includes ""Fingerless"" and that can trick someone, since they are half finger gloves.<br />The description includes ""cashmeres from Tibet and Mongolia"" but leaves out that the gloves are made in China.<br />The gloves should be toasty warm to compensate for the half finger exposure, but they're thin and don't feel especially warm. Since they don't warm hands well anyway, the gloves should at least be fingerless to block the fingers less."
1.0,"Returned, as it didn't fit right, and didn't really look like it did in the picture."
1.0,"Bought a small size propotion is weird, made for 6 ft people. Good width but too long."
1.0,"I have a small head and nose and the glasses are uncomfortable, tight and leave marks on my face"
1.0,I thought this will help with my ear skin sensitivity to nickels.  It's cheaply made and it didn't help me at all.  I was really disappointed.
1.0,Took xl never fitted
1.0,This dress made me sad. The sewing... I feel guilty for buying it.
1.0,Order 2-3 sizes up i couldn’t even get it on
1.0,"I definitely would not recommend these if you are tall. I'm 6' and they weren't even close to being long enough and because of that, it fit horribly in all the other spots."
1.0,"I've purchased a lot of dresses from Wellwits in the past two years -- but won't any longer.  This is the third dress in a row I've purchased that clearly runs MUCH smaller than the published size chart.  Additionally, the material this dress is made of is cheap and thin.<br />Wellwits, you've lost my business."
1.0,It ripped in the first time I worn it. Very poor quality.
1.0,The jacket came apart at a button. I wore it tree times. I want a refund!
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter. It was pretty, color was true to the pics, but it was very loose. It ended up falling out of her nose when she was walking across a parking lot after dinner. Never found it, she only had it 2 days."
1.0,This dress is very low quality - when I received it the cord was fraying and the fabric was so thin it felt like it would rip immediately.  I sent it back.
1.0,"This state's that is supposed to help your posture, i.ordered a size larger and i couldnt get it hooked"
1.0,"Only good thing I can say is it’s color is army green. It’s see through as you can see from my picture so if your going for warmth this isn’t it. It’s a waffle material like a kitchen towel but don’t even think this would dry your hands. So NOT worth the money, if it was $10 maybe but doubtful. Save your money and trust me. Pictures don’t lie."
1.0,Bought these because a youtuber recommended it (Tiffani Beaston) but they are horrible!  I bought a small because I’m rather petite and they are huge of me!  No support!  Learned my lesson - don’t buy something just because a youtuber endorses it.  Going back to my Walmart brand sports bras!
1.0,"I hot this and live the look, but it broke within a week! I would not recommend it. A waste of money!"
1.0,Chip
1.0,"Came broken and not green, it was blue"
1.0,"Robe gets fuzzies everywhere, literally everywhere. I have really tried with this item but it has not topped leaving fuzz everywhere it goes. Poor quality even though it's cozy."
1.0,Loved this robe for about two months. Zipper completely fell apart after two months of very gentle wear.<br />Im done buying any Chinese clothes from Amazon.
1.0,These jackets are smaller than small.  I normally buy 2X.  I bought a 4X in this jacket & it was still far too small.  IMHO the seller needs to stop & rethink the sizing of these jackets.
1.0,"Poor quality! Very expensive, looks cheap<br />Don’t waist your money"
1.0,I had ordered blue color wallet... Where as I received black!  Very much disappointed 😞.  Quality of the material is not good.
1.0,"The zipper blew out trying this on the first time.  According to the seller, an XL should be a 16-18.  She wears a 14-16 and the waist was so narrow the zipper ripped all the way from the top to the bottom.  It's not even worth the effort to return it."
1.0,Hate it. I want to return it. Really flimsy.
1.0,Size was correct but the paint came off the first day I wore them...
1.0,It's a ugly metal  painted in gold. Shaped horrible I couldn't even wear them they would hurt
1.0,💁‍♂️The product that arrived looked 🙄 NOTHING 🤨 like this picture! Not sure of the production but the material looked nothing like the picture it was a thin material🤬.
1.0,Very terrible dress. It doesn't look as nice as is in the pic.  Sewing is terrible and is very small.
1.0,They have already ripped and only wore them once
1.0,No tall sizes. Can't buy.
1.0,It didn't go over my 13 month old's knees and I orderd size 1-3 years.  I wanted it to go over his knees because he's still crawling.
1.0,It’s nice but not true to size at all. The arm length was very short for the body length of this suit.
1.0,Received gloves they looked like they had been worn for. O the and then there was a white stain on the thumb of the glove .... buyer beware
1.0,I am an average built person (I have belly but not too much :) )  . Usually Large size t-Shirts fits my built so i was expecting same size for this product but seems like i need medium size .<br />I emailed customer care but never received any response .<br /><br />~Hemant
1.0,Shoes was very small the size not accurate
1.0,Had to return it !! It started peeling the first time I wore it! I was quite sad cuz I really liked it otherwise.
1.0,"This dress looked abnormal on me. The draping in the front looks really sloppy. I'm going to have to return it. And I'm sad, I really liked the dress in the picture."
1.0,Nothing to help hold them on your nose
1.0,"The item came damaged. The ear was attached by a thread. I would consider replacing it but unfortunately do not have time to do so. Unfortunate that it came damaged, because it seems cute."
1.0,To small cut like a woman’s shirt.
1.0,Went to charge this beanie for the first time and the place where you plug the charger in broke off into the device and now does not work. Will be returning
1.0,"Shoes have no info on them as to material. Not leather as stated. Too small and no lining as shown in ad.  Basically, the seller hides the truth and does not respond to questions."
1.0,Thin gloves for mild climates. Returned and purchased a different set from REI
1.0,Dress did not have pockets as seen in picture
1.0,"Around the neck has these weird flaps that stick out over shoulders. It doesnt really show that in any if the pictures. Was going to uses for a family photo shoot. But had ti get something different because even after washing, and trying to iron, it wouldnt lay flat and looked horrible."
1.0,It's a hairbow - felt like a little girl
1.0,My 3 year old trying to wear it and it broke into 2 pieces.
1.0,"I have ordered the small, medium and large and it’s still too small for me. I am 5’2 and I weigh 120lbs. Every swim suit that I ordered said a different size but was in fact the same exact size. I put the large medium and small next to eachother and their was no difference"
1.0,Mask is stiff and uncomfortable.....bought the real tommy copper masks.  Much better.<br />Did not wash well either.
1.0,I ripped the glove about the first time I used them. Got down to 30 degrees and my hand got cold and needed hand warmers. Also I ordered -40 gloves and my gloves say -30. Not that matters if they worked at 10degrees I would be happy. Boooo this product!!
1.0,"I wear a size 12, therefore, I ordered an XL. This is not an extra large it's more like a small. Extremely disappointed. I was hoping that purchasing through Amazon I didn't have to worry about this. I couldn't get this dress over my head it's so small. UGH!"
1.0,I had to give them to my daughter who is no bigger than a toothpick! Not made for bigger people.
1.0,Socks tore and started to fall apart.
1.0,Sent vest back. Did not receive a refund. Did not receive any contact from seller.<br />This is a SCAM!<br />Cheap product. Poor workmanship.<br />Kiss your money goodbye.<br />There is no way to contact Amazon.<br />NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM AMAZON THAT HAS TO BE SHIPPED FROM OVERSEAS!
1.0,Oh my gave it away tiny like a zero I’m like a 12 omg
1.0,"Loved the belt and this morning, as I was putting it on, it completely fell apart.<br /><br />I've feel RIPPED OFF.  Obviously this belt was not made to last.  Shoddy craftsmanship."
1.0,The sizing is waaayyyy off I got a Med size 8-10<br />It’s More like a size 4-6<br />I couldn’t even get my arm through the sleeve<br />It’s beautiful<br />I wish it would have worked<br />I’m so disappointed
1.0,It's kind of cute in person but not near the quality I was expecting for the price.  I've found better necklaces at Hot Topic or Spencer's for way less.  I paid 3-4 times what this piece was worth which is why I returned it immediately.
1.0,Do not buy aluminum RFID wallets from Sharkk.  They do not stand by their products.  I bought a different model and the clasp broke.  Sharkk never answered my email.........so much for their guarantee.  Good luck getting them to honor any replacement.
1.0,Horrible sunglasses. Do not buy. And that do not let you return.
1.0,Terrible worst pants ever don't waste your money crappy material
1.0,"Well the little catch to hold the leash in place , so not to let the dog escape - is TOTALLY useless ‘cos it slips thr ( too small )"
1.0,The photo is deceiving. The actual product is so cheap looking. I returned it.
1.0,It was advertised as a white skirt it is not white it’s cream.
1.0,"I ordered a medium, but it fits more like an extra small."
1.0,SO INCREDIBLY SMALL terrible quality and not the shame of any dogs paw
1.0,Tip broke off first handle ripped second definitely not a toy more of a display model
1.0,The shirt came in the mail as expected other than the stitching on the shoulder has came unraveled which made a hole in it. This is the second shirt I've bought off amazon that I've had a problem with but amazon seems to ignore me on fixing the problems.
1.0,Does not look like the picture. In reality it was very ugly.
1.0,Too small and not what expected. Such A bummer
1.0,It has  a glossy look that I don't care for
1.0,"I loved it when I bought it - it looks durable and feels durable, but it is not. I used it for two weekend trips and I did not over-stuff the bag. The handle is now bent and won't telescope from dropping it onto the floor. One wheel assembly is tearing away from the bottom and the bottom corner seam has ripped apart and is exposing the contents (happened as checked baggage.)<br /><br />I generally like their products, and I like the function (deep- easy to pack two stacks of clothes) but this one needs much better construction."
1.0,I got the wrong mask..it was creepy and it had offensive words on it..I threw it out
1.0,It came apart on the 2nd day.
1.0,NOT RECOMMENDED
1.0,Why is the MK symbol backwards in your photos? They should look like this...
1.0,Only had this for a short period of time the chain broke and the flower tarnished quickly
1.0,Very strange bathing suit The one strap thing is weird Makes you look like Jane of the jungle- if you can figure out how to get it on
1.0,The zipper broke the first day I used it. Very disappointed!
1.0,Biggest piece of junk ever made that thing fell apart two times I cannot risk losing my watch over this junk
1.0,Horrible sizing bought this to come home from surgery I did read reviews it said it ran small so I bought a 2/3x looks like a mef6/large at best very disappointing
1.0,Got the LARGEST size and couldn't fit into it. Super stretchy and sticks to you like a second skin.  I usually wear 1X-2X. I BOUGHT A 5X!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,"I picked this up to wear to a denim themed fundraiser.  The color was much darker than the picture, but personally I didn't have a problem with that other than sellers should try to be accurate.  The overall fit of the shirt was great, I normally wear a large, and this size large fit great.  Cut seems be somewhere between regular and fitted.  The material quality and construction seems about normal.  But the buttons refuse to stay closed!!!  Throughout the night I kept noticing my shirt open and had to keep re-buttoning (I'm glad I chose to wear an undershirt that night).  This wasn't limited to just one or 2 buttons, but all of them!  Larger buttons would fix this, but who wants to spend this much on a pretty average shirt only to buy and sew on new buttons?  If you're someone who never buttons their shirts, this is probably OK for you.  For the rest, avoid!"
1.0,It looks so ptetty in pictures here..but what I received looked like 3rd grade art project.  Feathers nasty looking & bent. Wouldnt put on my baby for sure. :(
1.0,"Horrible on, not flattering at all. Looks like an oversized ruffle curtain and makes me look huge. I'm a size 2 for reference"
1.0,Didn’t fit good
1.0,Handles are to long. And zipper broke
1.0,These shirts are terrible quality.  The fabric is see through & they are cut horribly.  They looks like an oversized woman's shirt.  Not at all like the picture.
1.0,Ultimately had to return this item because it was truly impossible to open and get things in/out. Side note the look wasn’t flattering in person either.
1.0,It doesn’t even have one button to  close it in the front
1.0,Like a kindergartener's first crochet project.
1.0,One of the rings bases did not grip to 11mm rail.  Had to swap it with another (low ring that I already had) ring to get it to work.
1.0,Bracelet fell apart In less than 10 minutes after putting it on. I was able to repair but I have little faith it will hold together. Real disappointed.
1.0,This would be so cute if it was lined! I ordered the flower green because the pictures show that some of the solid colors are sheer.  The patterned ones are not shown as sheer. However the skirt is completely sheer. The skirt is also very long with heels. I’m short 5’2. The top fits similar to a bra or a bikini top in length not a cropped top.
1.0,"This is definitely NOT the blue dress I ordered. It's not even a dress, and a way different size so I couldn't even wear it if I wanted to. It looks some sort of Irish pioneer cheerleader costume. Not even close to what I ordered. I was really excited for that dress, and there were only a few left so even if I packed it up right now and drove over to UPS to ship it, which I don't have time to do anyway, and return whatever this is, I might not be able to get the item I wanted. Really disappointing."
1.0,"Wore and washed this once. Fit great, slightly sheer but not too bad. Washed it and the rainbow design stuck together ruining the design.  Pretty upset bc I liked that and that’s why I ordered it."
1.0,The necklace is so nice once i untangle it .. it arrived tangled it took my hours to untangle it
1.0,Bad lenses give me a headache. Clearly they are a certain perception level but for one who doesn't wear glasses no bueno
1.0,The gauzy material makes this WAAAAAY too see-through to be worn as a dress.  Glad I looked at my side view before washing and wearing as you could clearly see my rear through the fabric.  Would be fine as a long tunic.  It's a shame because their other dresses are nice.
1.0,These are 2 sizes too small.
1.0,"Bad quality material, low quality stitching and does not fit properly. Costs $40 while looks and feels like a $10 clothing"
1.0,"Worked for about an hour and then stopped. Not out of charge, lights on battery pack still work but hat lights won’t go on."
1.0,It was very small and thin. I was more shrunk after I wash it.
1.0,"Very difficult !!!!!! to open completely--does not want to snap into<br /><br />position when pushed all the way to ""open and locked position""."
1.0,"There wasn't even a place in the 'hat'  to put your head. It was impossible for my daughter to wear, and also very small. I threw it away"
1.0,"I was so excited when this arrived. So I had my daughter try it on right away.<br />The first thing I noticed was the extra ruffle in the front at the waist (not in the picture) which wouldn't have been terrible except it is bunched in the front and looks funny.<br />Second the elastic for the waist is very poorly sewn on and about 1/3 of it isn't attached at all, so one side is very baggy while the other is tight at the waist.<br />Third, one of the seems at the top is starting to come apart, about a 1/2 inch notch.<br />There were a few other things that were poor quality, but not terrible. The straps, over the shoulders, we're much to long with no way to shorten them. There were threads hanging from a pant leg. Most seems were questionable.<br />In the end, I am very disappointed and will be seeing about returning it. Hope mine is an exception and not the norm."
1.0,"One of the most unflattering items I have ever purchased! Material is horrible, there is no compression.  The waste has an elastic that is about 2 inches wide that feels horrible and creates a bulk where it should be flattering."
1.0,"The latch would not work.  I requested a return and replacement, but the reseller never sent the replacement.  I will NOT order from this reseller ever again, and I suggest you find another reseller as well.  They have my money and all I have is a non-functional belt.  Amazon is no help either."
1.0,"I've purchased about 6 straps for the Apple Ultra now and this one was the lowest price and unfortunately, the lowest quality. I should return it but for about 7 bucks, I'll probably not bother. I wonder if that wasn't their sales plan? It is nice looking and I like the off-white color a lot. That is where the positives end though.<br /><br />The problems are that it is tight to fit because it is shorter (and I have an average, 7.5"" wrist) and the material they use is also harsher and less comfortable. I'm hoping it will soften up over time but I don't like it out of the package. I also should have gone for the more expensive competitors with the titanium clip. I'm not sure what this one is made of but I'd guess it is plastic or a cheap stainless steel because that is what it feels like."
1.0,the product not as describe a wast of money
1.0,Super cheap bad quality you will find better ones at the pharmacy. Don’t spend your money they will no return. Well they do but it’s more expensive so I kept them and gave them to my niece.
1.0,I could not even attach the buttons together to wear as a bodysuit. This top is also super see through. I already returned and the process to get my refund is taking forever. Stay away!
1.0,"I have had these boots for less than a year, and they are already worn and smell like mildew. I bought them because they were supposed to be waterproof, but they have barely gotten damp outside and smell awful. Also, the soles have come loose and I have to adjust them in the bottom of each boot every time I wear them."
1.0,"I personally wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. If you want a binder that flattens you a little, go for it. The compression that this offers is mediocre and hardly makes much of a difference if you have a larger chest. The compression isn’t the only issue here though. This thing is extremely uncomfortable. It’s like they purposefully went and found the itchiest and scratchiest material known to man and slapped it together in this garment. If you don’t tuck it in it will roll up. I get that binding your chest is inherently uncomfortable to some degree but why exacerbate that further with these awful materials? I couldn’t imagine someone who is ftm who wants to use this to lessen dysphoria for 8 hours of the day when it is so uncomfortable to wear since it’ll scratch and dig at your skin. If you have a smaller chest and don’t mind uncomfortable materials that scratch at you all day, go for it. But if you’re looking for something to lessen dysphoria that’s comfortable to use for hours at a time that has binding power this is not it. Save a few extra bucks and look elsewhere."
1.0,"These sweatpants are sewn backwards!  The piece that should be the front has been sewn on the backside, becoming the rear portion ... and the broader piece designed to accommodate rounded bottoms is on the front and poofs out!  (I'm a seamstress so you can trust this evaluation.)  If i put them on ""backwards"", they fit properly - but then the drawstrings hang down my back and the pockets aren't comfortable  Where was quality control???<br />Very disappointing, as the fabric is softer and warmer than most sweatpants sold today...."
1.0,"Every pair started to fall apart at first washing.  Yards of thread in the washer, seams failed.  Very poor quality."
1.0,My son wanted these just to play around with and the material is very cheap and the part between the eyes and nose ripped after one hour of wearing.
1.0,I was looking for something big enough due to spine surgery problems. I had to give these away because they didn't fit right.
1.0,Broke after few uses.  Need replacement!
1.0,"A hole in the seam after the first wear. Others are correct that the ears flop, but my 5yo didn't really mind that. But the hole was quite distressing. These do not fit an adult, which is fine since we purchased for a kid."
1.0,All my breast are out didn’t fit as it said.
1.0,It didn't cover well on the rear end part.  Kept creeping up.  Like the elastic wasn't strong enough
1.0,Text coming off after only one wash/wear. Very cute otherwise. :(
1.0,It's not an off shoulder shirt.
1.0,"The face is not glass but plastic, it had no protective coating on it and was scratched prior to wearing. This makes it look cheap and will probably not get worn. Disappointed after waiting for over a month for it to arrive."
1.0,Terrible quality not like picture at all
1.0,Put together backwards so I can't even fit it onto my neck.
1.0,"Bad allergic reaction on my child.  Totally subpar material, I got suckered Into buying it for the cool print."
1.0,Broke after 3 days. I bought these as a gift and they broke after a few short wears. VERY CHEAP QUALITY.
1.0,I am a large in this size that I bought was an X large and it was too small
1.0,For the price I expected better quality. The metal must not be sterling because it irritates my skin and I can only wear them for a couple hours.
1.0,This is not as shown in picture. It’s just a long t-shirt - Cheap t-shirt.  Vendor wants me to pay postage for return. Ripoff.
1.0,Not Worth.....
1.0,"This swing is flimsy, tiny, and so low to the ground that our little Chihuahua climbs into it!! It's ridiculous how low and tiny sized this thing is!!<br />Horrible"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c92a4bc747a1b54252d1d886472595c2]] These were comfortable and lasted about 2 weeks before they started falling apart at the seams
1.0,To small...I'm small girl and still small
1.0,"I'm usually a medium, but this was way too small. Figured the large would work for me , but it didn't. the elastic straps were shorter than the medium which caused the bra to pull up over my breasts. Then I ordered the extra large thinking this must work, but behold it didn't. The extra large is way too big, no compression whatsoever, and the elastic straps do nothing for support. What a waste of time."
1.0,First pair of sunglasses I've ever owned where the glass pressed on my eyelashes.
1.0,Don't waste time.
1.0,ripped within one hour even though it was loose on me.
1.0,These are two different colors. What kind of quality control is that?
1.0,"After reading other reviews of people with similar height/weight dimensions as me I felt comfortable ordering this one. Unfortunately it's about 14 inches too wide and 2 feet too long (literally, I could almost wear this as a maxi) to fit like the model portrays. The straps are held on by cheap plastic circles with a break so they slide out easily."
1.0,"A few things.<br /><br />First: I ordered a size 3XL and was sent a 2XL instead. I inquired about exchanges and was told exchanges aren’t possible only returns. So I process a return request, return to buy the same pants, same color same 3XL size and they DOUBLED IN PRICE!!!!<br /><br />I ordered these pants about 5 days ago and paid $18.99 for them, today I processed the return and attempted to re purchase and the price is now $35!!!!! I reached out to costumer service and they said they cannot “price match” even though the reason I needed a price match in the first place is because the company erroneously sent me a size I did not ask for and then DOUBLED the price less than a week later!<br /><br />What a poor business practice. I would give zero stars if I could. It’s such a shame because the material of the product is great for running, great compression and beautifully solid no see through issues. I wanted to buy one in each color offered but I am NOT buying them for double the price of last week especially considering that none of the presented issues were my doing.<br /><br />⚠️ A word of caution ⚠️<br /><br />These pants are NOT 7/8 by ANY means. They are longer than full length. I am 5”3 and not only were these long enough to cover my entire leg but I had to roll them inside because there was about 1-2 inches extra after that (this was not an issue for me as I was planning to keep them before the whole return fiasco)<br /><br />Warning #2: the waist is ULTRA HIGH! these could have easily reached under my bra line if I had pulled them up completely. (Which again would not have been a problem for ME specifically had they actually sent me the right size)<br /><br />I believe these were made with person of extra long torso and extra long legs. Please be aware that the review about the insanely long waist and long inseam length are very much true. Do with that what you will."
1.0,"Fabric is nice and heavy, workmanship great but not the size advertised on the label"
1.0,The back of this sports bra is fun but it does not fit according to the size chart. The band was too large and the cup size wasn’t accurate. It also has really annoying and thick inside pads. It was not comfortable or fitting. I don’t plan on buying another sports bra from this company.
1.0,Too think
1.0,"I absolutely hated how this dress fit. Now don't get me wrong I normally love these types of dresses but this one was way too small in the boob area. If that wasn't bad enough there is like these seams that go from your underarms towards your nipples that makes it tighter looking and stupid. My husband asked what those seams were meant for because it didn't seem necessary for a design and I didn't know what to tell him, he was as confused as me. The fabric has no give and if you have big boobs I would pass, even with my size my bobs did not fit. the bottom part was nice and flowy though."
1.0,Most of mine came and broke or too small for even my toddler’s foot I was very disappointed
1.0,"I'm only 5'7"", not super tall, but seriously, this shirt is way too short."
1.0,It's garbage the bag came off within days
1.0,It smelled so bad I had to return it.
1.0,Great socks but these are for a small child
1.0,"For as much as this costs, I thought at least gloves would be included. Or the shirt. But no, it’s a jacket, the collar, the mask, and that’s it. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,Can hardly put them on let alone peel them back off
1.0,Loved when I received it but within 3 days the stone fell out and was lost.  Poorly made.  Pass on by or fortiy the setting when received.
1.0,Fell apart. Will not buy again
1.0,"Shirt came without seller tags, sizing information is way off and the print is horrendous. It looks nothing like the picture. The pattern is a mess. It looks as if parts of the pattern are missing and the rest were thrown together just to fill space. There is no symmetry or pretty centerpiece, which was the only reason I chose this shirt. Sizing is 2 sizes larger than stated and just the cut just keeps getting wider from the shoulders down. Very unhappy with this purchase."
1.0,Never going to buy anything shipped from China. Cheap material and very tough to return and most of the time you don’t get refund
1.0,Product maybe ok. But if you need to return not good. You pay to return and it will cost you $10 + to return. This is the cheapest. Seller will not pay.
1.0,This is the ugliest thing in the world. I feel like I could be a pirate. It just doesn't look anything like in the picture. Very disappointed.
1.0,I thought the material would be t-shirt material. It was a silky polyester type material. It felt like a Halloween costume.
1.0,Received it on time but there was a massive hole. It either got damaged in the factory or wherever it was or I got it used and damaged.. either way i probably wont purchase another pair from this seller. 1 star for me.
1.0,It's what I wanted but was supposed to be two and I only received one. Not happy because now I have one for my friend but not one for me.
1.0,"I am absolutely a 38D (measured myself and every other bra this size fits perfectly), so I know this runs WAY small. The band is close, but the cup size is not even close. I'm losing weight so I'm holding on to it, but I think I'd have to be a 34C to fit properly."
1.0,The sweatshirt was too large for me.
1.0,"Honestly, I would give these gloves no stars if I could.  They came in filthy packaging, have a strong, terrible odor to them and are not at all as pictured.  My hands still smell awful after trying them on! They are described as a size Medium, but are extremely small. My hand measures less than 6 3/4 inches in circumference at the base of my fingers (size small), and my hands barely fit into these gloves.  In addition, they are not the soft green color pictured in the listing. They are an atrocious neon chartreuse green--extremely ugly!  I do not recommend these gloves, even for the price paid!!!!"
1.0,I bought the black mesh top to wear with my white sleeves dress. After an hour of wearing the underarms of my dress turned blue-black. The dye got transferred to the dress and complete ruined it. Now I can not get rid of the stains.
1.0,"Way too small, def made for kids"
1.0,"Not cotton, really cheap fabric.  It's the worse mask I ever bought."
1.0,"Perfect fit, and exactly as depicted.  Very pleased!"
1.0,Too thin not a coat
1.0,Fabric is horrible. I threw it in the trash
1.0,"The band was suppose to fit Charge 4 - no end pieces to attach , so useless - not worth the hassle to return, but will NOT buy from t hem again!"
1.0,El vestido esta demasiado chico.
1.0,I did not receive the expansion pouch that is advertised as being part of this purchase and is supposed to come with this backpack. Ripped off
1.0,It looks like it should be sold at a flea market. Poor quality.  I returned it.
1.0,They are nice but i can’t even wear them because they won’t stay on my face the sides are to wide and won’t stay on!
1.0,Bought this for my daughter for Halloween.  She wore it when she got it and then carefully put it away until night before Halloween.  It wouldn’t work..changed batteries still doesn’t work.  She is so upset and crying.  And we are very frustrated.  What a waste!  I would give this zero stars but I had to give at least one
1.0,I bought this for a kid as it shows and it fits my face. It definitely is not a kid mask.
1.0,We received these adorable leggings and immediately fell in love with how soft they were but unfortunately discovered two small holes in the knee of one pair. I also felt that the fit was just perfect and once washed would shrink and become too short  so I decided to return and buy them again but in a bigger size. I did use sizing chart when ordering the first time. I received the leggings a second time and after one days wear the seam in the crotch of the pant has a huge hole! I am super disappointed because the print is cute and they are soft. I am contacting customer service because I want a full refund. It’s unacceptable to have holes in brand new pants from two separate orders!
1.0,"Got mine in, one was missing a ball."
1.0,"After having this watch for 2-3 weeks I believe I have noticed the wrist band scuffs easily, the month hand and day of the week hands turn the opposite directions and never stay accurate, and now the date won't turn. The only thing actually working correctly so far is the time. Hopefully that lasts."
1.0,Ordered my size but pants are like 2 to 3 sizes smaller. Like material. Too bad they don't fit and I'm not in a position to return them so money lost here
1.0,Read the product reviews.  This is NOT a dress.  It's a shirt.  You NEED leggings.
1.0,"Broke the 1st time I used it, had to buy another"
1.0,Hard to put on... took forever to try
1.0,"This jumpsuit is made poorly, and the description on the site is a huge exaggeration.  Do not buy"
1.0,Very disappointed.  Extremely thin.  Bought the same dress in a different color it was satin and the same price.  This is s cheap tshirt.  And see through...
1.0,"Disappointed. My housemate bought these for me for my bday and after one wash they ripped on the seam. She didn’t want to repurchase but I love how soft they are (and of course unicorns) so I decided to try once more and bought on my own. This time they ripped in a different seam after just one hour of wearing. :( very sad, as they are so soft and cute."
1.0,"Product was described as not see through, when these are in fact see through. Had to return them."
1.0,Broke apart after one day!
1.0,The item was chipped
1.0,I am a medium and ordered a large or extra large.  It fits like a medium.
1.0,This ring is a joke. It elephant is literally a piece of plastic glued onto the ring and comes right off. Looks nothing like the picture. Waste of money.
1.0,Ordered a large compared it to a small and it’s actually a small.
1.0,"Too small, fabric too thin."
1.0,Works fine for few weeks and all of them broke. Just my honest opinion.
1.0,"This belt looked good, but was poor quality and the metal part fell completely apart in less than 3 months.  I would not purchase this product again."
1.0,The sole is very low quality plastic and no cushion at all.  Garbage
1.0,The hat was too small. Very disappointed.
1.0,As a waver these are not what your looking for to get the job done. As a fashion statement its a good look for sure. The crown area doesnt stay in place. Doesnt lay down hair properly its more like matted more than its laid
1.0,The clasp broke after two months.  It was too late to return.
1.0,"Where to begin on the utter crapiness of these &#34;socks&#34;. So I got these to go on vacation, the price seemed really good in comparison to the other invisible socks on amazon, and unneeded enough for a full week. Flash forward to the actual trip. They *WILL NOT* mother freaking stay up in the heel. They fall down about once every ten minutes and I have to stop to take off my shoe and pull them back up. My heels have blistered and the whole experience is perfectly miserable. Duck these shibby socks. Duck them in the eye."
1.0,Lasted a week
1.0,I felt the material was scratchy and was not soft at all. Due to buying as a gift I did not wash it to see if that helped. I am returning it.
1.0,"I ordered extra large, however these were too difficult to pull on. It took 20 minutes the first time with the help of my wife to get the socks on both feet. Once on they were reasonably comfortable, but it then too a long time to get them off, again with the help of my wife pulling. The 2d time I tried to put them on it was impossible. I'll never use them again, but not worth the effort to return them"
1.0,Shirt is nearly 14 inches smaller across the chest than advertised!
1.0,"I was disappointed by the weight of this jacket. It was much lighter weight than I thought it would be. But the bigger issue was that it’s huge. I ordered a 4T for my son and it went down to his knees and totally covered his hands. I actually have no way of knowing if I was sent the wrong size because there is no label on the package or tag in the jacket itself. Also, there is no tag with washing instructions. Honestly so weird. I returned immediately."
1.0,"You could never wear this with a normal shaped bra. My boobs aren't all that big and it still looked super awkward. Also, the lining is very nude and more obvious than I would have wanted. I really wanted to love this dress, but didn't."
1.0,They were way to large!
1.0,"They weren't made well, they fell down my older daughter's leg who is 7 so order them for a toddler."
1.0,The black material is almost see through when barely stretched. Runs small.
1.0,Looks like lingerie
1.0,"I am a size 8, this belt was too thin and I donated it to Goodwill. My sister is a 6 and it was tight for her as well."
1.0,Sunglasses came scratched all up on the right lens. The rhinestone part has scracthes on it too.  I already took the tag off before I noticed that so I doubt they'll take them back. Buyers beware!!
1.0,I asked for gray and got tan.
1.0,After less than a dozen times of wearing the seam of the toe of one of the shoes is separated and there is a hole. I bought a no-name brand pair for my son the last time which lasted two years without a problem and these twice as expensive shoes have lasted less than a couple of weeks and unfortunately I cannot return as it is too late. Very very poor quality. The only reason there is one star at all is because you cannot submit a review without it.
1.0,Item broke b4 my daughter could carry it out the house
1.0,The dimensions are different in reality from what I ordered. Very disappointed. Fits poorly and the color is a coopery black not just black
1.0,"I first ordered the medium but it was too big. I wasn't crazy about the elastic waste, but thought the dress itself was cute.. It was just too big all around. I had to return to order the small since exchanges weren't possible. The small is super short (higher than mid thigh) and while it fits better in the chest and waste area, it does feel a bit tight in the back.. so the small is too small and the medium is too large- maybe it was mislabeled or there are consistency issues with the product. I really wanted to love this, but it proved to be a waste of time and money..."
1.0,Tarnished beyond belief!! Return
1.0,Had to return due to too tight
1.0,Got “pills” even after I washed it before wearing. Disappointed in the fabric.
1.0,I do zero if I could the jacket was literally the same texture and thinness of a trash bag.  They were just ditched on your upside down and cut off completely .
1.0,This belt does not hold don’t buy
1.0,Soft but too thin.  Cannot wear without long shirt to hang over hip area.  You get what you pay for I guess
1.0,So small I could not get either of them on.
1.0,NOT the OG ones that have high quality - these are super bad and thin and rub off fast
1.0,Has a hole in it at the seam......poorly made. You get what you pay for.
1.0,Appears to run small
1.0,This is for a very short torso
1.0,Hate it. Your product literally has to be filled to the tippy top for some to be able to pump out a
1.0,"I can't believe anyone would write a good review about this dress!!!!! Please don't buy this dress. The stiching is weird, the material is thick and it looks nothing like the picture. I'm a size 2 and purchased a small and it fit like a large."
1.0,"Nice hat But I thought it was going to be the same colors all the way around, not half and half on the hook section."
1.0,"Pretty cheaply made. Good example is that it broke the first time I opened it. I should have send it back for a refund, but put back together as best I could."
1.0,I got suckered instead of sucked in.....toooooo small
1.0,I wanted to like this product but they felt so cheap like they would break after 2 wears. I would not recommend anyone buy these or use them if you own a jewelry making business.
1.0,Fits very weird. The shoe is cut oddly so your feet does not sit well on the soles. Wouldn't purchase or recommend again.
1.0,not at pictured and the fabric it was made of was very clingy and not flattering. would not recommend.
1.0,The jacket I received is definitely not the jacket that was pictured. It's a completely different fabric that looks and feels like felt. It's a much lighter solid grey. The fabric content on the tag inside the jacket is not the same as what was listed and couldn't possibly be what the jacket is made of.  The sleeve has a catch in the stitching. Very poor quality and construction!  Comes from China which is not specifically listed in the description either.
1.0,"Poor quality, didn’t Even last one week at school"
1.0,"Not impressed so far. Other than just really liking the aesthetics. The links keep opening up on their own, and I've almost lost my Fitbit twice since adding the band."
1.0,"The material is nice, but the chamois gives zero support. These are for people who like to spend money and strut around a gym. Ain’t nobody got time for that. I ended up ripping the chamois out of the shorts and throwing it in the trash."
1.0,"Cheaply made. Breaks easily. Received 1 already broken, 2 more broke within a week."
1.0,Oversized Butterfly pink sunglasses are plastic and light weight!
1.0,"The fabric in the pic is not at all what I got it’s a cheap fabric which makes the dress look cheap, so disappointed"
1.0,"This item don’t live up to the claims, my glasses still fog up.  They need to go back to the drawing board on this one."
1.0,I gave this to my sister from my son for Christmas before she went out of town and they managed to mess up something so simple.
1.0,What can I say but you get what you pay for. Not at all happy with it. Sitting in my closet unused
1.0,Awful. The pin clip was too small could not keep claps together.
1.0,"The backings are actually very tiny, not standard size, so they make the earrings look much larger than they actually are."
1.0,Very poor quality. Become loose and slip on hips.
1.0,Not practical at all !!!
1.0,Legs were too long my elderly mother tripped and was seriously injured... ran way to big
1.0,"Face is quite large, larger than I expected but I don't have to be wearing my glasses to tell time now.<br /><br />Revised Sept. 23, 2017<br />After a month the watch started losing time.  Decided to replace the battery after less than 4 months use and the back of the watch will not snap back on.  Husband tried also and the back will not snap back into place even being tapped with a jewelers hammer.  Now my watch is useless.  Places here won't replace batteries unless you bought the watch from them."
1.0,Broken already pin coming out why wearing
1.0,The zipper broke. It was bigger then expected. I wasn't even able to wear it for Halloween which is what I got it for.
1.0,"Horrible, cheap and tacky.  Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,The fit is way off on this suit. The top was tiny and the bottoms very unflattering.
1.0,Cut isnt great on the straps. Way too thick. Cut for 300 lb body.<br />Shirt is skinny like sock
1.0,"The XL is more like a small. I'm typically an XL up top and a 12\14 below. While this is a very nice suit, it did not fit even a little bit."
1.0,"This is absurdly small. I ordered large, and the waistband and hip only went to around 26-28 inches! No no no no no. Also, the sleeve was too short.<br />If something from China is selling here, the sizes need to be translated correctly; otherwise, don’t enter the market. It only frustrates consumers and wastes time and money.<br />Otherwise, the style looked like it would be nice, and the fabric was delightfully soft, though the tag says there is no silk content, so the listing should not say “silk satin”. Silk refers to the fiber content, specifically strands made by silk worms. Note: I’m not partial to silk anyway, since it’s usually taken by very cruel means, so it’s great that it’s not silk. The problem is that the claim does not match the truth. It’s satin (type of weave). But it’s not silk.<br /><br />I can’t give this more than a star. It didn’t fit in any respect, and the fiber content was false."
1.0,Cheap material. And colors don't match in sleeves
1.0,The dress came with makeup on it.  I will be returning.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Too large. Returned
1.0,"cheap looking, not impressed."
1.0,"The material is flimsy the color is not what I had expected its an overall ugly dress. Doesn’t look like the one on the page. I’m truly disappointed, The picture makes the dress looks so beautiful when I open up the package I could not believe that they sent me this ugly dress material is flimsy the color does not look like the pic it’s an overall ugly dress. Doesn’t look like the one on the page."
1.0,Just finally decided to use this purse I ordered it back in July And the zipper is broken. And the  lining had a hole in it.
1.0,This looks nothing like the picture...
1.0,"The photo with model looks totally like something I would wear. Then I opened the package LOL Fabric is that cheapy printed polyester old woman fabric that reminded me of those gaudy house mumus from the 70s. Not only was the print on the fabric blurry and muddled, but the fit was horrible! It was like it should have fit but it didn't. The arm holes were not right and the sleeves were way too short. That's probably why the model has the sleeves rolled up.  It was like whoever made the pattern for this top has never made a pattern before. Ugh... return..."
1.0,Necklace was sent to me broken. The necklace was also covered in what looked like sticky glue and had looked used!
1.0,"Looks exactly like my old Switch belt, but does not work the same. Clasp does not hold the custom cut belt in place. It’ll seriously pop on you. Get this if you want pants to fall off when you least expect it."
1.0,"Dress was returned, dress wasa but irregular.  The waistline in comparison with the remainder of the dress was not suitable for a normal human being.  Dress was returned for a refund."
1.0,It was. Decal and not crocheted
1.0,This hat does not stay on your head. It's a grea sun blocker but if no use it flies away and falls off. No way to tie it and I HATE IT!!!!!
1.0,Cheaply made and doesn't stay on through the night!
1.0,Top zipper broke first use had to return.
1.0,"Fabric is fine, but the hood is really pointy. Looks like a Klan hood. I'd look elsewhere if you want this design."
1.0,Size is not true to fit. I recommend getting 1-2 sizes larger than normal.
1.0,I ordered it thinking it would be a good necklace and within the first 2 days the tiny ring that holds the chain broke
1.0,Chain is pretty cheap looking and the crystals just don't pop out like you would expect something touting 'Swarovski'.
1.0,Chain comes open and you can’t get a key ring through the hole. Almost lost my house key twice. Very cute but not functional
1.0,These are by far the worst ive gotten so far.....bent frames lenses pop out if you look at them wrong.
1.0,"I have hands about the size of your average 12y/o and super tiny wrists, the elastic snapped when just trying to put it on my wrist, and some of the fingers elastic arrived already broken. Definitely do not recommend."
1.0,I had to return the product it was small and tight worst experience ever and the sizes are not accurate order up unfortunately
1.0,"Don't buy, not like picture and can't return cause seller won't get back to me."
1.0,"I got the blue dress with roses. It's a pretty, but it's too thin and see through. You could clearly see my undergarments"
1.0,Makes you look fat..
1.0,Bad quality. Do not buy
1.0,I don’t like it it doesn’t fit and I want to return it I lost the return label and don’t know how to get another one
1.0,This product is very tight on the cabs and a little baggie up top. The material is very cheap.  They do not look as represented in the picture  Instead they are a shorter length and the material is very shiny
1.0,It’s a pretty dress but sizing chart is way off. I ordered according to my measurements but it runs EXTREMELY small and I couldn’t get it past my thighs.
1.0,I received an obviously used shirt. It was covered in deodorant stains. It was disgusting. I have no desire to support a brand that sends out gross used items. Returning immediately.
1.0,"I've viewed this item on 4 different monitors, and on all of them the hardware appears to be silvertone (even though the description doesn't indicate what it is). I loved the look of the bag, so I decided to order it for Spring.  It arrived quickly and even came with a dust bag.  However, I was extremely disappointed when I opened it and the hardware is actually the brightest goldtone I ever seen. Needless to say, I'm not a fan of gold, so I immediately requested a return/refund..."
1.0,Way too small and quality was poor
1.0,"Very thin, very small, in donations bin."
1.0,Didn’t keep time from day one. Sad too cause it had a nice look to it.
1.0,I got this item for my 5 yr old grand daughter  it came with a white tshirt that said bloody Mary.  Really???? Then when we tried it on her the one shoulder buckle broke. I am VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED poor quality for sure!!!!!
1.0,Ordered the largest size looks okay. Have not tried to try it since it reeks of some chemical. Will probably throw it out as the smell is still there. Will not be ordering from this seller again
1.0,Way way way too small. 5x doesn't fit a size medium woman.
1.0,I ordered up a sz to a sz 13 because other reviews said they run small...that's an understatement! The sz 13s look like a sz 5! They are smaller than a little girls sz 12. Would not recommend buying unless you go about 4 szs up or want to have to mess with returning like I have to do now.
1.0,Pretty at first but the tip randomly broke off after a couple months. :/
1.0,It was a little too small and much longer than shown in picture.
1.0,False Advertising👎🏾
1.0,Great before washed but then black bleeds on white.
1.0,The photo and delivery time was fast. The only reason why I gave it one star is because the clip that holds the chain and dog tag together broke off and when I contacted the company who made it said I had to buy another dog tag to get the piece I needed.
1.0,Don’t get this!!! Cheapest plastic sticker and if want to return you have to pay over $5 just to return it Zin basically you just lose<br />Money on this low quality product
1.0,this hat is really nice. it fits my 7 month old baby and i hope it will stretch so she can wear till 24 month. colors nice and bright. but flower NOT that big as in the picture and it was a disappointment but still very nice looking. i didnt expect that the hat is that thick.<br />UPDATE  so my baby now 13+ months old and this hat barely fits. as some other review states - this hat is the same as one sold by another seller at 1/3 of the price - $6...and this picture is misleading...very disappointed at this fact! i wish I bought it for $6!
1.0,Product does not fit device
1.0,The item was too small and there was no weight to it.  It did not &#34;wrap' the ear as indicated on the photo.  It was returned to OkaJewelry the same day of delivery.  Would not order
1.0,My sister got me these leggings as a gift and through Amazon.  I did hot yoga in them and my sweat darkened these leggings in an all the areas where I was sweating and it was obvious.
1.0,Too tight and not returnable since it was a 3rd party.  Very frustrating
1.0,No me agrado debido a que llego rota de un bolsillo
1.0,The zipper did not even unzip all the way  which made it impossible to get it on.  The material is thin and I thought I might rip the seams trying to get it on. It was worth a shot for the price had to return it.
1.0,Received box with no earrings in it. Disappointed. These would have been pretty earrings. Requested a refund and got my money back. I didn’t wanna re order only to have it happen again
1.0,The fabric is terrible . It has yellow blotches all over and is very ugly . It was going to be a gift but I would not even wear this myself.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8a8e1195a593f3fae861319aff91e3b6]] The quality was not checked before it was mailed. The charm on the shoe is what I purchased from Etsy; the one in my hand is much smaller and harder to read. The blue on the dove is not the Sorority color. The rubber is flimsy and thin. I am returning these.
1.0,"I normally wear a medium, and thats what I bought. This is too large and too stretchy. Not flattering at all. Gave it to my Mom who has much bigger booties than me. Mind you, I am a 32DD."
1.0,"Made in China, not a fan, they are huge for a size medium.  However, my husband purchased this product for me and I have no interest in this.  Not worth returning to get 1/2 the money spent back so I guess someone else is getting a donated gift and hopefully they will like it."
1.0,"Hour hand is about 17 minutes off, throwing off the time when I read it .. is there a way to fix this .. isn’t a watch  supposed to tell time."
1.0,I usually wear a medium but I ordered a small and it's HUGE on me. I'm 5'5 120 and pregnant and even when my belly gets big I think it will still be big on me. Since it's the holiday season I'll probably donate it to a shelter and buy a coat at Target.
1.0,"The belt is very stretchy, either because of the material or the braided design, and kind of useless as a belt. After just a few times of wearing it (seriously, twice or three times), the thing has permanently stretched so that it wraps around my waist almost two full times (I am a size 29 waist and ordered the corresponding belt). I would cut it, but the end of the belt has the leather piece with detailing and I'd hate to lose it.<br /><br />Overall, useless."
1.0,Bought this for a friend so we would both have one since it stated set of two. That isn't true. It only comes with one. Waste of time and money. Was supposed to be for a special gift for her. Extremely disappointed
1.0,I got 3 diff sizes for my 3 girls and they were all weirdly sized and look crazy. They aren’t soft material and just looks nuts all together.
1.0,"If you want soft and Not scratchy, nope!"
1.0,Top too small. Go up 2 sizes but then the pants are too big
1.0,My 6 yr old daughter wore these 3 times and one of the plastic straps broke.
1.0,"The website descriptions;  masks are 5 ply but actual pkg. label indicates 4 play.<br />And it also implied the masks are made in Korea, but they are obviously made in China.<br />And also  are bit small for adults"
1.0,2 of the 4 shirts had the stitching unravel after the first use.
1.0,The watch doesn't work period no matter how much you move or shake your wrist. My husband was very upset that he spent money for a toy watch.
1.0,Material is substandard cheap felt much like that used for a child's crafting project
1.0,I got a bag of screws instead of a watchband
1.0,"Edit December 18. The bags are falling apart now at the seams. I take back what I said about durability.<br /><br />These bags are just the right the size. Not so big they're unwieldy, and not so small they're useless. The material is durable."
1.0,Runs really small and I ordered XL to have it more loose and I'm a size medium. Returning it.
1.0,"I took them out of the package to put them on and the infinity band broke. I wore them to work ( I am a secretary, not strenuous at all) and the anchor caught on the jacket pocket and snapped. These were cheaply made. Not worth the time it took to get them (a month and a week)"
1.0,"I ordered the size appropriately based on the chart and couldn’t even close the zipper. NOT an elastic waist, cheap material. Tried to send back, wasn’t able to use Amazon return."
1.0,I saw this set in a store but it was the teardrop/ oval set. It was beautiful. The stones were nice. So when I saw this in hearts I couldn't wait. Sadly the first set I sent back. The stone was missing from the heart. The second set came an it also looks like the stone is missing from it also. My boyfriend says it is there but it is just flat. The stones do not look like the ones I saw in the store. The earrings stones are good. The Necklace is disappointing.
1.0,They won't stay. But I'll have to figure something out. Its worth returning. Maybe I'll gifted them.
1.0,You have to have a child wrist to wear this.  Save your money it's a waste
1.0,"The earrings were just the size and style I was looking for.  What I was not looking for was the fact that the posts were a flimsy plastic That bent too much to attach a back--then, when I finally accomplished that feat--the hot glue that attached the plastic to the earring back dislodged and left me with two pairs of earring that were unusable. I haven't even tried the other two pairs because, frankly, it just pisses me off too much.  I would return them, but it is more trouble than it is worth.  I cannot express how horrifically these earrings were produced or the impossibility of getting even one wear out them.  Glechhh."
1.0,Ordered 3x which I wear... was not 3x but more like 2x. Very disappointed.
1.0,"This is NOT a Geneva watch.  If Geneva is what you want, don't go for this overpriced substandard timepiece."
1.0,Awful broke first day
1.0,My glasses sank
1.0,Seamed like a good buy but they came undone at the seam. Wouldn’t buy again.
1.0,"arrived with a broken lock mechanism, disappointed."
1.0,Looks like a clown dress
1.0,Made in China I’m sure need I stay more
1.0,"Way to small and delicate. Had not realized they were baby earrings until I recieved them. Although the size was stated I never realized they were for babies. Having never measured my hoops before the size didn't click with me, however if it said &#34;baby earrings&#34; I never would have gotten them."
1.0,The material was very flimsy.
1.0,The inside compartment dividers are all detaching.  I was fooled by the desciption also and thought I was getting leather.  Horrible.  Wish I had returned it in time.
1.0,"Not worth the money, the material didn’t last!!! I literally squatted down & my shorts ripped!!! They ripped down the middle. This was my second time wearing them, 1 wash & they ripped!!!!"
1.0,Straps broke after only 5 wears. Wont be buying the brand again.
1.0,Way to small would have to have ordered 3 sizes bigger to fit
1.0,"Another mis sized piece of clothing!  I returned it, went and got a Visa card for my friend to go purchase a coat the fit. This is so screwed up in the sizes."
1.0,Terrible did not fit at all and couldn’t return don’t buy them
1.0,"The molle adapters do not look like  the picture. The ones that I received were square, not tapered. The ones I've received were completely useless.... Oh the touch pen never received, also never wanted. Over promised, under delivered. Not an accurate picture."
1.0,Don't purchase this. It broke within a month.
1.0,Too flimsy. Didn't expect such unsupportive fabric. Crawl down from breast.
1.0,I bought this shades and I loved them but my lenses scrapped on my first ride so I wouldn’t buy them just cause they aren’t durable
1.0,I only received two of three pairs
1.0,This broke the first time it was played with and had a very short return window. Ridiculous
1.0,"This dress was very tight across the chest, and I’m of average proportions. The stitching was sloppy, and it was horribly wrinkled. It went back."
1.0,Not long like the picture and hate it!
1.0,After wearing watch for 2 days in a row my arm<br />Muscle was cramping up like sore too crazy but super HEAVY WATCH
1.0,Not true to size chart
1.0,I was very disappointed when this shirt arrived. It was I thought going to be a sweatshirt. That's what it is described as in the ad. Material is very light. Thinner than tee shirt material. Very large in size. I'm sending mine back.
1.0,This broke two days after I had it. Garbage.
1.0,Fabric uncomfortable
1.0,These goggles seemed great at first. And then they fell apart after one use. They are very poorly made.  DON'T BUY.
1.0,Sent this ring back cause it is very cheaply made.
1.0,Not as shown! I bought a small and it's huge!! Don't even show no cleavage. Just a regular vneck.
1.0,"These are way over priced for the cheap quality that they are! I bout them for my grand daughter's birthday. She put them on, took one step, and the whole platform came off!!  Of course I shop early and can't get a refund because I bought them a few months before her birthday. DO NOT BUY THESE THEY ARE POORLY MADE!!"
1.0,Material is a weird texture with a pattern that looks like ugly green from far away and is all pixelated up close. The arms don't fit right. Do not buy.
1.0,Someone screen shot a picture and blew it up too large and put on shirt!  It’s all blurry and terrible looking!
1.0,"Been buying this exact pair for years.<br />Nothing else like them that I can find.<br />All of them have needed to be stitched better where they cross in the back. Got to the point that I would just do it when I got a new pair.<br />My latest pair came apart at the clips in back.  See pictures.  These are 3 weeks old (daily use). Before I bought this pair,I contacted Hold Up Suspender company to see if they can double stitch me a pair.  The company responded, that they have their stitching done outside and there is nothing they can do. They said sometimes they have QC issues.<br />Can't await for another brand to pop up."
1.0,Looks cute but came apart the first time I wore it.
1.0,Looks good but cheap product. Fell apart the first day I used it😡😡
1.0,Cut to fit and made a BAD squeaking sound
1.0,Had write in a ton of players because stickers were missing and the board came with the same round printed twice. Junk.
1.0,I bought and it was way too small and the jacket was very small. I do not recommend buying this cosplay.
1.0,I am rather disappointed. I knew not to expect much for $7. When it hangs the center bee does not sit in the center of the moon like the photos. It’s poorly put together and I don’t think I can fix it.
1.0,"I followed the sizing guidelines, but when this thing got here it was incredibly small. Had to return it."
1.0,"Unlike what my blinds manufacture uses, this bungee stretches in less than a month and needs replaced.  Inferior material- don’t buy unless for a quick fix"
1.0,AWFUL! Leggings are very cheap and the back of the two white lines came uneven. Couldn't even get one of my legs into these because of the design. DON'T BUY!!!!
1.0,"This product was smaller than I expected. Had to return it, barely went down to my waist."
1.0,Returned this product. Runs extremely small.
1.0,I bought this because they look like the Buffalo ones I picked up from TJMAXX but they don't fit the same. They are much tighter around the legs and the fabric doesn't feel the same even though the cotton/spandex content is the same. These may be knock offs. The writing on the band is white for the real ones/better made ones.
1.0,It came with a hole between the legs. Thin material
1.0,"Poor quality craftsmanship. These key rings do not have a very positive interlock, so the two halves can easily separate when you don't want them to."
1.0,"I purchased two set earrings from this vendor and the ad is very deceptive the ear rings are soooo... small the vendor must have magnified the picture at least 30-50 times. That is what I call false advertisement. Furthermore, the post on the earrings is very short you have to have extremely thin ears (paper) for it to fit. I am very disappointed about this purchase and would like know how or where to return the products I want my full refund ASAP. I will never shop from this vender again. Please!!!!! Stay clear... just know you have been warned."
1.0,"This helmet is not hard plastic and will bend easily.<br /><br />Also the face slit is cheap thin plastic.<br /><br />Lastly the proportions seem to be incorrect, this helmet seems much wider and rounder then it should be."
1.0,I'm a 36D and order an XL and it is still too small. It is also very poorly made with cheap fabric. Definitely not worth the money.
1.0,"This hat is illegal because the chin strap poses a huge choking hazard. All chins straps for children in America, have to be detachable. This one is not. Please fix this. Thank you."
1.0,The size of the shirt does not go with the size chart. I ordered an XL and it fits like a medium. I double checked to see if I had ordered a child's XL. But I ordered an adult size. I am very disappointed in this because I love the fabric.
1.0,Does not fit like photo runs larger and wider so it is not a flattering look at all ! It makes me extremely boxy. Will return ...not flattering for curvy.
1.0,The arms are really tight. There's. I mobility.
1.0,"The zipper broke after a few times of wearing this coat. The coat feels too heavy, almost awkardly heavy , and the zipper is awful!<br />Never buying from this company again!!!"
1.0,Somehow these pants were made wrong. Petite is below heel and calve is wrinkled because too tight.
1.0,After 1 week I had to message seller because the sole inside would ride up ankle and almost come out of shoe. I have not heard back from seller about the problem.
1.0,These are huge. I ordered a small and could have put two of me in there
1.0,Would not charge
1.0,Won’t go over my 1.4mm chain necklace which is just a normal size chain so now I have to take it to a jeweler to make it work.
1.0,there are better ones out there don't waste you money
1.0,These shoes are too small.  But there is no return address and no info about the seller.  I want to exchange them for the next larger size.  Please help me.  Thanks.
1.0,Returned - it arrived folded and would not go back to size. Also the interior was more like a paper than a material. Looked really cheap - nothing like the picture!
1.0,broke the first time I used it
1.0,The shirt was nothing I expected. It faded in the wash and the material is cheap. Not even wearing it. Very disappointed
1.0,"Certainly doesn’t look like the picture. The print is horrible!  Not a single whole bird like shown. A bird head here, a bird tail there."
1.0,Way too heavy and won't stay in place due to the heaviness it slides all the way to the hand
1.0,Super see-through. Not very flattering. It is stretchy. Will be returning. I got a small.
1.0,Doesn't fit the phone very well. Tends to &#34;stretch&#34; out & gap.
1.0,There is also a pattern on the top at hips on side that can not be seen. Also extremely short!
1.0,No es nada d como se ve en la foto<br />Demasiado grande y la tela horrible<br />El dibujo de frente es diferente color
1.0,"They look good in the picture, but not so much in person.  I wore them once out, they’re creaky and make my feet sweat.  All cheap plastic.  I take some responsibility, should of read what they were made of, I presumed leather. 🤷‍♀️"
1.0,Bought for my son who NEEDS a men's small and this is NOT...
1.0,the durags were good quality it’s just i ordered 12 but only 6 came.
1.0,Threading in the middle started to come apart with a day.
1.0,White color bled out to streaked tan!
1.0,"This was a little too clingy for me, it help to my tummy which is what I thought the belt would help hide. What's worse is when I returned it, they issued the refund and a mo th later charged me again saying they did t receive the return!"
1.0,Doesn't even look like it does in the picture. Hideous!
1.0,Horrible. Nothing like the picture. I bought the clear lenses and the lens has a red tint to them.
1.0,I did not like how cheap it looks and it looks bulky.
1.0,Great look and very dark but extremely tight around the head. Very cheap but you get what you pay for. They lasted 3 weeks before breaking
1.0,"I don't usually write reviews, but for these shoes I must let everyone know don't do it!!<br />After 6 months I still have blisters. Top outer side of big toe always rubbed raw. They never broke in properly before the stitching started coming apart. These boots were a huge disappointment.<br />Don't Do It!!"
1.0,The stone fell out easily. Amazon says I can return for a refund... :(  I used some gorilla superglue and put the stone back on.  Now they are cute again.  Update: gorilla glue 5 stars never fell out again.
1.0,Returned company only refunded partial cost
1.0,Not the fabric you are expecting. It’s stretchy and not good.
1.0,Don't waste your money on these socks..They look great when you're not wearing them but once you put them on they stretch out and you can't even read what it says.. they look horrible when you're wearing them.. plus it took forever to get them..BIG LET DOWN..I hope Cannibal Corpse is making some money off this but I doubt it....LAME
1.0,ugly tarnished mess
1.0,Not even the right saying on the card. This doesn't even rhyme. I like the bracelets I guess ill just have to make my own card. 🙄
1.0,Misrepresenting the number of masks you get. It says you get 50. I only received 5. Where's the other 45?
1.0,Very cheap material. Should be sold at dollar store
1.0,Cheap Hat!! Wish I could give it a zero!!
1.0,pulled hair before i even got it on. it stayed on the watch for maybe 5 minutes.
1.0,"Sadly, super cheap looking and not well put together"
1.0,"Garbage, flimsy. Came off in 2 days. Isn't strong going in and out of my pocket."
1.0,I put them on they looked great I sat down and a huge rip from my buttcrack all the way to the side. Absolutely horrible.
1.0,This item looks nothing like what was in the description....I'm very disappointed
1.0,Did not fit correctly.
1.0,My wear broke on arrival. I returned the item and was refunded
1.0,"Low quality, cheap. I do not recommend this at all.."
1.0,This was very small. My child didn’t get to wear it.
1.0,I ordered a 38 DDD… cup size look like a B.
1.0,Do not order this if you need the smaller rings it only comes with the 12mm ones not the 8mm
1.0,"I actually purchased these for a craft project because they have the patterns and colors I needed, but alas since they have no stretch and they are small and as such they are not useable for that project . What will I do with them? Well, not worth me returning them, so I shall just hang these in trees with some scarves in areas where there are homeless people who may need warm feet in the coming colder days."
1.0,"So small,  could not see any crystals. Very disappointed. Would not recommend to anyone."
1.0,"There were no reviews on this product when I ordered. Big mistake.<br />I ordered a couple sizes bigger and was still too small in the waist to go over my boobs or hips. The waist is not the size as described, cheaply stitched with no give.<br />Pretty dress but cheap and unwearable."
1.0,Very poor quality. First time I put them on the lining on the right leg tore the entire way down. Too bad because I really liked the look and pattern.
1.0,The rings are too small and I never received item as pictured. Ordered twice. Not Satisfied
1.0,"These look as expected with the varying sizes but they do not stick to skin.  That was the whole reason for our order so, not worth the money if that's why you are ordering them."
1.0,The Actual watch looks NOTHING like the photo representing it on AMAZON. The watch is dull and no where in comparison to the nright colorness illustrated.  FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!
1.0,"The clip did not hold tight, and I lost it the first day I wore it as it fell off and I didn't notice."
1.0,I was very careful to read a lot of reviews and went with these because being a plus size women I wanted to make sure they wouldn't be too tight.  Being as plus size I don't have oversized calves and I even measured them to make sure I was buying the right size.  Bought one size that was the size recommended and the next size up and both were too tight.  Won't buy again.  Seems you need to buy 2 sizes bigger than recommended but not even sure that would work.
1.0,It’s a beautiful Horus eye but the leather band is terrible quality. I don’t think it’s leather.  I’m disappointed.
1.0,Dont buy this. I used it as school rolling backpack and it got torn just after 2 days using!
1.0,Runs really small. The fit is also awkward and doesn't quite look like the picture. I'm 5'3&#34; and 120lbs and a small was too small for me. Didn't love the look of the material or the way the peplum hit my torso. All just a little off. Super bummer because it's a cute idea
1.0,"The instruction sheet is sorely lacking in clarity.  If I had not already owned a watch almost identical to this one, I would have been lost.  After setting the watch, I tried the count down minute timer.  After counting down, no alert or alarm sounded.  A count down timer isn't any good if you don't know when the time is up.  I returned it."
1.0,"Overall bad quality shirt. The fabric was thin, itchy, and shiny all at once! Returned it as soon as I tried it on."
1.0,The glass of this watch fell out and the black face instert was lost. This happen after after only a few normal uses.
1.0,Did not care for it.  Too stretchy.  Would have returned it if I hadn't thrown away the receipt.
1.0,Terribly made - looks real cheap
1.0,The clasp already broke and I've only had this for two months.
1.0,Smelled weird and is difficult to unlatch
1.0,I should have listened to the other reviewer. This necklace is backwards. The posting's photo must be a mirror image.
1.0,Came bent and missing a gem.
1.0,the worst part about this is your photograph.. that's not the color I got and it was way too small..
1.0,"These are not cotton, the size is incorrect, stamped on the side of the sock is S_M I ordered the size 9-11 dont think s-m stands for a larger size. I had to take them off after an hour as they were so tight that they hurt my feet.  I have never seen navy socks so dark, look black to me."
1.0,Super scratchy material. Sewing was super janky. The top right shoulder was mistakenly sewn together... 🤔<br /><br />#return #wouldnotbuy
1.0,The sizing runs very small and when we tried to return or replace it would not allow us so now we are stuck with two costumes we cannot even wear
1.0,Short with short torso. Cutouts placement all off. Material okay.
1.0,These shirts are swimsuit material and fit like a swimsuit. The material is too thin and you can see through it to the nipples is you're not wearing a bra.
1.0,Rip off. it says “36” but only 6 we’re in the package. false advertising
1.0,The outfit is beautiful but it’s about three sizes too small I was not happy and they gave it away instead of hassling to send it back
1.0,"These earrings are very small, won't even fit over your pinky finger. The pair I received, one of the stones had already fell out of one of the earrings. Definitely returning."
1.0,Loose and cheap thin material.
1.0,Very see through without even squating. Would not recommend.
1.0,These earrings are so tiny it's hard to see the color of the stones.  They are ridii small. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"This is suppose to be high quality silk. It is more like a straggly sock. It seems like this is just long strips cut from a pillow case. A cheap pillow case at that. I can't believe I paid $40 for a long ragged piece of material. The quality is just not there. It wouldn't even bunch up I'm my hand to be able to tie it properly. It just hangs there with no shape or form. And it is uneven from end to end. One side is straight in some places, and the other side is really squiggly which makes it impossible to wear, because no matter which way you tie it, you see the uneveness. Not to mention that ungodly smell. What is that? You can in no way wear this anyway, due to it having to be close to your head, with that smell going on. It will just radiate up into your nostrils."
1.0,"The dress is nothing like the image.  The picture presents a soft, flowy fabric dress, but the dress is just like a cheap, long man's shirt.  Also, the size chart is off.  Using the size chart, I ordered an XL.  The dress was inches from closing.  I realize it was very inexpensive, but I expected that the manufacturer was selling a dress like the one pictured and that the size chart would be accurate."
1.0,"The band is huge and difficult to remove links.  We couldn’t get it to fit right on my husbands wrist, either it’s too tight and won’t close together or it’s too loose.  Useless for a FitBit since it needs to fit snuggly so it can take readings from your wrist.  Also, can’t return so be prepared if it doesn’t fit you are stuck with it."
1.0,The clasp wouldnt stick into my watch on one side. It kept falling off
1.0,"The shirt fit perfectly.<br />However, it was not made with attention to details.  The pockets are fake pockets, and the stitching did not look professional.<br />It says, &#34;Made in China&#34; when you walk down the street with it on."
1.0,Not the best of quality and very very small a xxxl was a mens med maybe a slim large
1.0,They lasted about a month before the coating came off and now they look like they are 10 years old. I don’t recommend
1.0,"Received mine with the clasp broken, I can't get it open to even wear it!"
1.0,"Although the pant is cute, I believe they tried to pass off a much larger size than the extra small that I ordered. There is no size on the pants themselves, only on the package that it came in. I ordered an extra small and these things are huge!"
1.0,These are knock offs that look like a Chamberlain but they do not work. Followed their instructions to the T and no joy. Seller did refund my $.
1.0,The material was really cheap
1.0,"It contentedly goes up, doesn't stay down, I have to pull it down all the time. I don't recommend this. I might need to buy a better one."
1.0,So bad.
1.0,This did not fit me well at all…I’m short so it just looked sloppy on me
1.0,It look mucho better in the picture then a person
1.0,Don't bother it's just rubbish
1.0,I bought this as a gift to myself for Nurses Day and the part that attaches to the apple watch broke after less than two months.
1.0,"Too short, too rough and unlined. I returned it."
1.0,"I have used this band for 3 months, and I’m buying the actual Garmin replacement band. For the life of me, I cannot get the strap to stay in the holder. It slips out and flaps around. I am constantly fastening it down again. I do not recommend this band for Garmin users that wear their watch all day everyday like I do."
1.0,"They fit good, but it had a small hole and it tore so fast without pulling it....smh"
1.0,"Runs really, really, really, really small. Buy an XXL if you’re a large 😏"
1.0,material was very cheap n damaged very quickly
1.0,"Bad quality and so small they look like a child’s size. I’m usually a small or size 4 in women’s, I could barely get these on. Not comfortable, and weird material. I should have known by the price but I thought I’d try."
1.0,Turned black after one wear
1.0,"If your head is larger than the average 7 year old, or your ears are farther back on your skull, its useless. The ear slots were where by sideburns are, same was true for my 11 year old son. Like the concept, but definitely not one side fits all."
1.0,"I really like the watch bands, but they are not compatible south the Galaxy S3 Classic watch."
1.0,The damn thing was way to heavy to wear......let alone set it on my flimsy book shelf...lol but it seemed to be very well made
1.0,This is a horrible product.  The instructions were poor and it kept falling off the ring...even when it was &#34;attached&#34; as instructed.
1.0,This skirt is nowhere near the color blue as in the picture. It is also very big in size. Looks sloppy and green. Very disappointed!
1.0,Ran small and pattern was not flattering
1.0,Sizing way off 3x fits like small never order Chinese clothing
1.0,"Esta mal el destornillador, queda mira grande."
1.0,"Scratchy, boxy, and cheap looking. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"It was broken upon receipt I returned it to manufacturer, not sure they refunded me?"
1.0,I purchased these on December 28th. The seam where they cross in the back has come totally apart.<br />They are totally useless in less than 1 month of use.
1.0,"Broke after a week, and too small"
1.0,I bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter and it is so small she can’t get it over her head.  There isn’t a clasp and there is no stretch in the cord.  Don’t waste your money on this!
1.0,This product is I received wasn't the same product as shown
1.0,The strap fell apart while I was walking.
1.0,Would like to return will not work<br />Pls send return label to ups to pu at house
1.0,It's very flimsy even for the beach. Not a good buy for the cost
1.0,Material was too thin to serve its purpose. Returning this item.
1.0,I ordered an X-Large and it fit like a large. So I wish I ordered a size up. Also the sleeves were bunched up like the picture and the shoulders were a bit more fluffier. It is like the shoulders and sleeves swapped the way they were suppose to look.  I will be returning and not re-ordering.<br /><br />Side note: The color is fantastic and spot on.
1.0,The material is the consistency of a Halloween costume. Very matronly looking.
1.0,"had to return it - I always wear a size 12/14 bathing suit, so ordered a 14 to be safe considering what the other reviews state. The straps/body part fit fine and I like the colors. The cups are crazy big - I wear a 38 D bra - I'm in no way small in that area, and there's no way I can fill this out, or adjust so that you can't see the girls. Totally disproportionate."
1.0,Missing the wand butterflies and crown.
1.0,Who knows how they fit.  I can't figure out how they are supposed to work.  Really.  This sucks.
1.0,"Ordered the Kirby mask ( Sans-01 ) because my son loves the games, but this mask was far too big for him, and even a little too big for me. He also said it was difficult to breathe through when we tried it on him. Disappointing."
1.0,"I wore this for a costume on Halloween. The main issue is that although waistline sizing (side to side) is key to ordering, the problem is that height is taken into account as well (up and down). Because I'm about a 32 waist but 5 foot 10, this costume was way too small to a point where I couldn't even wear the hood. Even if I tried, you couldn't see what it was. Not going to wear this again."
1.0,Color not as bright as shown. Fabric rough and cheap looking. Horse print faded looking. I will return this item.
1.0,The watch band clasp came bent. It is completely useless now.
1.0,Tarnished within two weeks
1.0,"The fabric quality is not what I expected at all. I know raglan isn't supposed to be like cotton or even a cotton blend but this fabric felt like costume material. The sew quality wasn't the best either, don't waste your money!!"
1.0,The shirt definitely runs small and it's made of a fabric that reminds me of fireproof children's pajamas. Looks great on the model in the picture wish it looked like that IRL. Another case of you get what you pay for.
1.0,"really shiny, not exactly work appropriate"
1.0,"These led screens are $23 on Ali, the height, longer width(just a bit), and a higher DPI."
1.0,"Horrible product. Stunk like a cheap china plastic. Very uncomfortable and hot, can't breathe. Can barely see out of eye holes."
1.0,Not at all as described this is not a coat at all...did not fit right and I'm very disappointed..would not buy again..
1.0,Color and matirial is good but not breathable<br />I mean very congested and very tite
1.0,Pins didn’t come out freely  No stars
1.0,To damn small.
1.0,"due to the ""screw on back"" they were harder to put in my ears and they hurt due to the threading on the earring."
1.0,The little flap inside that is supposed to prevent fog from getting on your safety glasses does not work. The only thing it does is tickle my nose. I will not be using these masks.
1.0,Hard to see with the plastic
1.0,No tiene absolutamente NADA DE ELASTICIDAD. PURO FAKE.
1.0,It came cracked straight across the eye piece and the center nose section isn't even attached to the helmet. Some glue will fix the nose part but overall disappointed since this is a gift for a family member.
1.0,Came in the mail broke
1.0,I ordered a large expecting the top to be a bit tight. It ended up being way too large in general. I dont think the measurements are correct. Besides the size the material is extremely cheap. For $36 I would expect better quality and not have large strings hanging off of it. I would not recommend. Amazon makes returns so easy though.
1.0,I returned this item because it’s nothing like the picture. I felt duped!
1.0,I did not like how they fit like cowboy boots
1.0,"I give this a 0. This is not a dress it is a shirt that fit my 10 year old daughter who wears a kids 10-12. There are not pockets, the material is not right the colors are not right. If you are going to show a picture of a dress you can make at least learn how to make it.  Not happy at all with this purchase. I have emailed the company a few times regarding the purchase and they will not respond. Never order from Merry mou store that's for sure"
1.0,Nothing at all what it looks like in the pictures which is super disappointing and I t’s like a swim suit material.
1.0,Awful color.
1.0,Necklace was busted...
1.0,Yo big
1.0,The beads were so small and hard to pop together
1.0,Didn’t like anything about it! Doesn’t look like the picture more a costume .. fabric is thin and spandex material
1.0,Wore and washed twice and hem is coming out.
1.0,The waist band was not long like the picture nor was it adjustable
1.0,"Not at all slim fit.  The photos have been altered or the shirt is pinned back like they often do on mannequins in stores.  Super wide and baggy around the chest and mid section.  (6’2” 195 athletic build, ordered a large). About an extra foot of loose material all around.  Will return it."
1.0,"Complete waste of money.  Necklace appeared to be some ""stone"" that had been painted but only on one side.  Extremely poor quality.  Looks like something out of a bubble gum machine."
1.0,NO STARS!<br />This was the cheapest quality product I've ever gotten from amazon!  The shirt looked nothing like the photo and was made of a low quality &#34;sweat wick&#34; fabric.  Ordered a large so I could wear it as a tunic and what I got was a a super small.
1.0,Clearly for the price I wasn’t expecting much but it’s misleading…not leather and also not red. Color is more of a dark dusty rose.
1.0,I bought this coat for my granddaughters birthday. I'm pleased with the material and plan to have it monogrammed for her.
1.0,Fell apart within a month.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Wear it once and it broke... junk
1.0,One of the Shoes broke
1.0,"You walk, they snag and pull. They were cute in, terrible to walk in."
1.0,It didn't fit my fitbit on one side and was a waste of money.
1.0,Had to return necklace... looked tarnished and dirty.
1.0,Bothersome to wear after a while.
1.0,didn't like them at all... returned!
1.0,"Too small. I ordered a small based on my measurements instead of just going a size up from my US size. It felt like it was cutting into my armpits and choking me. It was so adorable, fabric felt great but I had to give it away. Lady I gave it to is a US xxs. Fits her perfectly."
1.0,the box in which i received my in all pieces. i couldn't find the necklace in the envelope.very disappointed
1.0,The lace detail on the sleeves looks like someone attached a doily on the sleeves.  I won't be wearing this top.
1.0,"Item size is extremely Small, not even close to description on Size chart! Ordered 1 size Bigger and item did fitmy daughter! Now having a Problem Returning Item! Can not print labels and instructions say I have to Pay Shipping Fees! I Highly Do NOT Recommend this Vendor!"
1.0,"This is exactly what I been looking for,something I can take to games and not have to hold continually(like binoculars)trying to keep steady while scanning the field and crowd,thanks to these reviews I know now not to purchase,I figured it was too good to be true for 10 dollars,thank you Amazon! My question is there anything out there like this that does work?"
1.0,"Poor quality! Not at all like pictures. Worse, I returned the item two weeks ago and the company has not yet refunded my money."
1.0,"Its not worth it, definitely"
1.0,Cheaply made low quality
1.0,Horrible shirt! Ordered a 3x and it was short and fit my daughter who is a large. Do not waste your money on this item!!
1.0,"This item was listed as being made in the USA.  However, the label on the product says, &#34;Made in Korea.&#34;  This is not the first time Amazon has been inaccurate with country of origin descriptions. These socks are beautiful; it's very disappointing to have to return them because of an inaccurate description."
1.0,Extremely ridiculous product. Very thin. Item came with several parts of stitching not completed and had two holes on the front of the jacket larger than the size of a quarter.
1.0,Bulky and unattractive
1.0,"I ordered this, few weeks back because i love it the first time but this time around the stone on one of the silver earings is gone as shown on picture below. i dont want to go through the hssle of returning the items i just want the silver earngs replaced. as soon as i received the replacement i will most probably update the rating to 5 stars"
1.0,Looks so cheap and returned the same.
1.0,had to order 2 sizes bigger than normal.
1.0,This item was like 4 sizes too small. My arm would not fit into the sleeve. The size information needs to be update. A total waste of money.
1.0,ew
1.0,No need to explain why I returned it.
1.0,"I’m 5’4 and 150lb, I ordered a size Large after reading the reviews and it is STILL too small. It also is not the same color as the picture, it’s more bright and pink. It’s a cute dress, just sizing is terrible and very cheap quality."
1.0,"After just six weeks one of the handles has already started to come detached and the stitching has come undone. Very disappointing, as the return window closed just two weeks ago. Super bummed. This is junk."
1.0,The upper arms were extremely small and I was unable to wear the dress. The material was nice and it looked like a beautiful dress. I was really disappointed that I couldn’t wear it.
1.0,"I couldn't even try the dress on because it was sewn shut! It looked like it was probably true to size, but a dress you can't put on is pretty useless isn't it?"
1.0,Size large way small
1.0,"The product was not what was pictured or described.  I have used the gloves in the picture many times,  but what I received was flimsy, thin,  and short.  They were a different product completely and did not even come in boxes,  but they came in a bunch of tiny plastic bags."
1.0,The peal fell off in 1 week
1.0,The ear string are very short. I am a woman with a small nose.  The mask squishes my nose and presses against my lips. Makes me feel like a pug.
1.0,The sizing is way off. Unfortunately now is too late to find any costume to replace it on time!!!
1.0,Does not look like photo at all.
1.0,Complete waste of money
1.0,For a 6xl and couldn't get it around me at all.
1.0,Came with a hole in the side where a pocket should have been. Really cheap material.
1.0,"Very cheap material, not at all cozy. Also the zipper sometimes works sometimes doesn‘t. Super cheap. Would highly recommend walking away!"
1.0,No good tarnish in two days
1.0,"Nice pants, comfortable. My only grip is why in the HELL would you not use a quality zipper. Zipper broke after a couple weeks. If the seller wants to ship me a new pair I will gladly revise this review. If not. People go somewhere else to buy these pants.  Too many sellers to buy from to deal with this type of problem."
1.0,Too wide. Cheap iron on emblem
1.0,It broke within a week from taking on and off
1.0,Nothing! The dress wasn’t the fabric it appeared to be in the pic! I have African print skirts and the material is definitely not the same. It felt cheap and not worth the price. Color not true either.
1.0,"Mask is uncomfortable . Has a ribbon instead of a rubber band to hold it in place.  Very hard material. Mask is not flexible,  Brought for my husband but he didn't like it"
1.0,"This only worked for a month. I bought a new battery and it worked for only 2 weeks! I had theses baqtteries replaced by a watchmaker, and he is a pro! Boo-this watch should not have given me ANY trouble at all, but it has been a lemon.<br />Of course, it only has a one month return policy, Grrrrr...."
1.0,"I wear between a XL and XXL. I ordered a XXL to be safe. This shirt was entirely too tight. I couldn't even get it over my shoulders. Such a shame, too, because the design is cute and the material is so soft."
1.0,The product arrived with a couple of holes in the fabric. The holes were about the size of a pencil eraser.  I contacted the seller and received no response.
1.0,Horrible quality. I bought this blue color and the black and the leggings were completely different. The black was ok but had the elastic on the waist which I hate. The blue looked like joggers before I put them on. Very big in the waist and crotch area. The blue leggings had a free floating elastic band in the fold over band part and they were see through. Very disappointed because I have had friends order these and they were perfect! The material of both leggings were not good either. Ordered a medium in the blue and small in the black. They are completely different. No branding or tags on either.
1.0,Had me sweating so bad and I work in a temp controlled warehouse don't wast ya money
1.0,New clasp on hand
1.0,Is this a child's mask? It's extremely small and not what was advertised.
1.0,Advertised as being flowing but oversized and tent like
1.0,"I ordered a woman's large. What came would fit my 9 year old, not me. They do seem to be a nice thick quality, just are tiny."
1.0,Chain broke 1st day
1.0,Horrible y pésima calidad
1.0,Junk cheap
1.0,Several beads fell off.  One of the clusters that was held on with hot glue fell off. terribly made.
1.0,Came with foundation stains from what I assume was from someone trying it on then returning it. Highly disappointing that my shirt came with stains already on it.
1.0,Box completely squished and opened
1.0,Fake jewelry
1.0,Sucks. Sending it back. Cheap material and 2x size was maybe a large for most other similar products
1.0,This dress was sized for a child.  The sizing was way off even though I read the chart and several reviews before ordering.  The seller wasn’t much help at all.  Just a waste of money and time.
1.0,"Within 2 weeks of use, moisture seeps into toe/ball of foot area and boot does little to nothing to insulate from cold temperatures."
1.0,"This showed every flaw, so it was returned. It would probably be better in a pattern or solid dark color."
1.0,"Love the style of the skirt. but wrinkles a little too easy.  Now, haven't worn the skirt yet and the closure fell off already.  Poor workmanship."
1.0,"The tabs on the band stick out from the sides of the watch and do not lock in securely. Also, the bad lacks elasticity and is too large causing the end of the strap to hang away."
1.0,Did not receive the belt
1.0,These pants are like a child’s fit. They are way to small I’d have to order a 3-4x if not higher just to able to fit them and they don’t even offer that size. So disappointed. The fact that I paid the amount I did for them to come in and be as small as they were is sad
1.0,One would think that this came with a parent and child hat by the pictures and description… yet one hat was included for this product.
1.0,"Estoy molesta por que desde que lave el coats se rompio,rompió, eso que lo puse en ciclo delicado en la lavadora.muy molesta"
1.0,I love my little clock.  I received it and it was in excellent condition and will go well with my collection (I have almost 200 miniature clocks).
1.0,Very cute black but of a waist and too small
1.0,Very disappointed in product.
1.0,Made my boot like two mushroom tops. I have a great booty I just wanted a lift. 👎
1.0,As soon as opened plastic covering one strand came apart wore with 2 strands same day fell apart at work pieces everywhere terribly made
1.0,There is cheap clothes. Then there is this thing.  It looks and feels more like a tarp.  What is pictured is not what I got.  There is no kind of stitching or anything in the front to make it a wearable item.  The &#34;panties&#34; that came with it are way to small for the size you chose.  But then again it doesn't look like size means anything
1.0,"Whatever size you normally are , get the next size up because these run small"
1.0,FAKE!!!!!! DO NOT BUY. Horrible quality
1.0,Sent it back mine had a constant whistle while riding and doesn't have replacement visors.
1.0,"I can’t attest to how these fit because I wouldn’t even let my daughter try them on. These were beyond disappointing. Besides looking cheap, they had embossed Chinese writing in the actual shoe, cheap shiny plastic masquerading as leather, and ours were clearly used, worn, and dirty. Now I have a crying 7yo. I’m disappointed that Amazon would even sell such an item. They’re going to stay on the porch until I can return them."
1.0,Ordered 2 different packs and one is bamboo fiber feels great and the other one has NO bamboo!!!! Its spandex.
1.0,The neck opening is HUGE! Not a good fit.  And short.  Would not buy again
1.0,"This shirt has the most unpleasant feeling fabric, the seams are ""seamy"" (bad) I didn't even think it was worth the trouble of returning. I put it on our community ""Free table""...I am sure someone else will like it."
1.0,The bow is hot glued on :(
1.0,Band felt junky and like it was going to fall apart.
1.0,"Not as pictured. The colors are very dull and muted not vibrant as shown, akready looks washed out. I ordered it plenty big enough, up two ehole sizes, fits like a very tight tank top, no way is a tunic type fit for over skinnies or leggings. Worst of all though is the horrible chemical smell that made me nauuseous. Seller did promptly refund my money."
1.0,My daughter is in size 2T and got size 3T  and it's to small. Washed it once and its falling apart.
1.0,handle broken at arrival. It was a complete waste of money and time.
1.0,Bought this and broke within a day. U get what u pay for it guess
1.0,The keep broke after only two months. OK band but the quality is not good.
1.0,This runs extremely small. Purchased 2 different sizes and they are both too small. The xxl is more like a medium.
1.0,Cut very small and material is very heavy
1.0,I only got the pants and they were all torn up
