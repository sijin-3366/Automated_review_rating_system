1.0,I was really excited about this set but my first time wearing it after the washer & there was a big hole on the butt area. Material is cheap.
1.0,gotten
1.0,"This is cute looking, but the fabric is awful. It felt stiff and prickly. I washed it and it was only slightly better. I cannot wear it! I will give it to some poor homeless person who will not care that it is really awful."
1.0,FUE DEVUELTO
1.0,"As much as me and my partner love these I will not buy again. Within the first few hours of me wearing mine, it broke and breads went everywhere. My partner had hers come off and can no longer find it two days after getting it."
1.0,I thought I was ordering an actual hat. The pin is very small. I will be returning the ones I ordered.
1.0,"I received this necklace yesterday, and wore it last night. It was tangled up within an hour and impossible to keep untangled throughout the evening. I had to remove it. Will never wear it again. Too bad, cute double layered necklace. Didn't even get a chance to see if it would tarnish around my neck."
1.0,"Well its a mere shadow of the old 2002 BR i've used for decades, very sad to see such bad quality that filson has sunk to"
1.0,They Are Horrible
1.0,"It was see-through :( Also, there was nothing slimming about it on my body.... Easy decision to make to keep or not. Definitely returned!"
1.0,Dry cheap looking
1.0,Odd Fit
1.0,This dress shouldn't even be listed as a 4xl this dress wont even fit my niece and she is a size 12 I knew this dress was small when the ups man gave me the package
1.0,Flimsy and too small around the waist... I'm a size 8. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Flowered material wrinkles very easily. Very cheaply made
1.0,"These were terrible, it‚Äôs a sticker that is very stiff for nail"
1.0,"The heading states it is sterling silver, but when I received it, there were no markings as such, and it is not the same color as sterling silver.  Very disappointed with this product.  I feel the description is misleading and dishonest."
1.0,The dress is cheaply made.
1.0,"Product is fine, I just want it off of my recomendations"
1.0,It‚Äôs horrible. The fit is nothing like as pictured.
1.0,not as pictured. very tight and short
1.0,Quality was not up to the mark
1.0,These are not sublimation.
1.0,They weren‚Äôt the right colors as shown they sent all the wrong colors. And the shirts were not Y back they looked like regular tank tops.
1.0,"This bracelet watch band is just not okay.  It is frankly not that great looking even though mine appears to be made of stainless steel.  One side next to the watch is a curved solid piece with a lobster clasp (see picture), and one side has a square sparkly detail followed by a chain.  The lobster clasp on mine was put on upside down, so that when I am trying to attach it to the other side with the chain, the lever is on the wrist side and the opening is on top.  Since the clasp is attached very close to the solid piece of the band, there is no twisting it around to have the clasp open toward on the bottom. Since I am trying to attach it to a floppy chain, it is nearly impossible to do one handed.  There is second way to open the chain though, and that is that the sparkly square is also a clasp.  Alas, the tongue side the clasp attaches to is on a hinge.  So. . .  when trying to attach the clasp to the tongue on the hinged side, the tongue just keeps tipping up or down, but not aligning with the tiny rectangular hole of the clasp.  If getting it onto my wrist were one and done, because after all, the apple watch is water resistant, it would be tolerable.  But given how often the watch needs to be removed from your wrist to charge it up, getting it back onto your wrist is too much of a royal pain with this band to make it even remotely functional unless you have someone readily available to help you dress.  My band is now off my watch never to be reattached."
1.0,I never received it for I had to cancel it. When I pay my bills off I will buy it. I think it is very nice loo k ing and simple so I will eventually buy it.
1.0,"Kids love it but after washed it, still can smell the toxic chemicals like."
1.0,If you want grey with blue. Good luck!  I tried 3 times and even with calling amazon support never got them. If you want black with red then your in luck because no matter what you order thats what you get. Th glasses are fine and provide good comfort and protection but just dont plan on getting what you ordered.
1.0,"After three wears, my dress has several holes in it. The fabric is literally falling apart. Do not buy!"
1.0,"The fit was to big and very unconfortable, also a heavy shoe"
1.0,Don't buy this . Badly made
1.0,"Nobody could figure out how to properly set the time on this watch, but my kid didn't care, he just liked the look. For literally two days, until the band broke off! Cheap shoddy garbage."
1.0,"These are cute, but they would not hold ny son's glasses in place. The holes that you thread the frame through was too big so it would slide around. I am returning them for a refund."
1.0,Cheap scarf with a large MADE IN CHINA label sewed on.  Returned.
1.0,The material was cheap and it looks nothing like the picture
1.0,"I purchased Little Kid size 1, which (according to size chart)  should be 7 3/4 inches.  It was 9 3/4 inches.  Had to return it.  Size is not accurate to size chart.  This is also after i originally bought one that was size 10 little kids (my son's normal size even though the corresponding inches didn't match US) and the shoes turned out too small. I can't win."
1.0,Muy chiko
1.0,Not satisfied at all. Warped construction- looks odd and feels odd.
1.0,Large! Chunky! Heavy! And way too small for anyone but a child to wear - which would look ridiculously even bigger. Disappointing
1.0,Was more like a small not a large!
1.0,the are anti glare coating makes things appear darker which I certainly didn't need.
1.0,Top area too large!!!
1.0,"The leggings fit great a little lose, but I can see thru them. Which makes them impossible to actually wear."
1.0,Love the colors however too short and very rhin material cor jeans
1.0,"If you are a woman or small-wristed man DO NOT BUY this watch strap. While the fabrication is ok the stupid design of the watch has the two &#34;retaining metal bands&#34; sewn into the buckle side making it impossible to adjust the retainer to secure excess strap (about 2 inches in my case) and prevent it from catching on everything in sight. It caught on the door, computer, broke my makeup mirror as it caught and dragged that down. Yes, it's adjustable but you cannot secure it.  This is STUPID DESIGN at its finest.  I do not recommend this watch. I suggest that the company provide a movable retaining band and call me - I would love to buy this when this problem has been fixed!"
1.0,"Picture is fun.<br />Mask is made of a low grade polyester.<br />Smells bad (washed by hand once) and is very hot, hard to breathe in"
1.0,Not satisfied with the material...looks like a pajama set...I will be returning
1.0,The quality is not good and the lights were damaged quickly
1.0,I didn't know what size exactly to get and now it's small.
1.0,"runs very small .. my daughter is small, I asked for size M red color .. and it looks XXS .. black  I asked equal M and it looks small .. delay so much in arriving !!!"
1.0,Should‚Äôve gotten the gray- one wash of the black and it‚Äôs gray. Pointless.
1.0,definitely not true to size.
1.0,The product isn't worth the money
1.0,I returned this item it‚Äôs not at all what is in the photo very disappointing.
1.0,veryyy cheap material that hugs your body all wrong
1.0,This is more red than a burgundy. It‚Äôs also pretty tight and I sized up when I ordered
1.0,Junk....although it's comfortable it had way too much excess fabric at the armpit area. Looks like something a child sewn together.
1.0,Way too big for what I wanted it for
1.0,These were the wrong size I got 7/16 when I put 1/2
1.0,"I really liked these at first. They fit well and my daughter has been able to swim comfortably for a while. She has been wearing them for weekly swimming lessons. However, after a few short months, the material is now wearing out. It seems that the elasticity is being worn out by the chlorine. I was sure when I received it that the quality would hold up and be durable. I am disappointed."
1.0,"I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt keep the package inserts as I‚Äôd have liked to reach out to the seller before writing this review.  These earrings would have received a 5-star rating for being both attractive and sturdy.  But sadly, even though this is one of my favorite styles of earring closure, neither earring stays closed.  I‚Äôll happily re-rate and amend this review should I learn what the best course of action might be.  Thank You."
1.0,Looks more like a nightgown. Completely see through.
1.0,I ordered 34/32. They said on the label 34/32 but were 28‚Äùlong.
1.0,Pins holding the wristband broke the same day we got it! Definitely not for an 11 yo boy.
1.0,In less than 2 weeks both earrings had each lost a stone. In the same place. I suspect it is due to a manufacturing defect as the only option available was a return/credit üôÅ
1.0,"Head's up to anyone looking for a cleaning cloth for brass. This is not it. It works as labeled for silver and gold, but didn't make one iota of a difference on brass. And, no the brass I used it on is not lacquered. Big disappointment because I expressly purchased it for an ornate brass lamp.<br /><br />The label needs to be changed."
1.0,Don‚Äôt water your money!!..
1.0,To long down to the knee
1.0,Do not like at all! I wear toe socks all the time and these just slide right off...UGH!
1.0,this is a piece of garbbage is not worth the monies or the time it took to get it these pants are not worth it the material is cheap and the workmanship is also horrible
1.0,"By far the worst purchase I've ever made. The part to hold your boobs.... unless you're an A cup, don't bother. The material is super thin, and the stitching is crap. Planning to return this."
1.0,I loved this bag. It was everything I thought I wanted until the zipper broke 45 days after purchase and the window to return is 30 days. Very unimpressed.
1.0,too bulky for my 3t feet.  Poor quality.
1.0,"First, these are NOT compression socks.  Second, I have average feet & calves (these are tall socks but not to the knee) & still the print stretches out on the socks when you put them on.  It looks terrible...  I got my $$ back but they really need to re-label these correctly."
1.0,"I returned this item. It was very wobbly and some of the vertical rods did not go into the base at all. Also, horizontal rods could not go across the V in the vertical rods if I tightened them well. When I unscrewed the vertical rod for alignment, then it was wobbly. I choose a studier product: an off-white leather double bar bracelet holder that is small in diameter so I do not have to stretch my bracelets. I am going to but another one of those."
1.0,This sport bra did not fit and I bought it in my right size xl. So if your order this order it a size up.
1.0,"The material isn't whats expected,its cheap elastic material, when i thought i was going to get a sheer material. Item is nothing as expected base on the picture, complete disappointment."
1.0,Terrible quality. Broke within an hour of the first time I wore them.
1.0,It came with dead batteries......not happy at all....
1.0,"Returned due to lack of quality, very thin and falling apart via threads"
1.0,The screw will loosen and detach from the key mechanism after a few days of use. It doesn‚Äôt matter how tight you turn the screw! I almost lost my keys on 4 occasions! Do not buy this cheaply made device!
1.0,The bust and upper waist way too tight even with a larger size. I am returning and getting larger size. Would highly recommend ordering one to two sizes up. Hopefully this larger size will fit.
1.0,Runs REALLY small!
1.0,"This is not a hat or cap. It is a tube, not closed at either end. Very disappointing!"
1.0,"I was going to gift this to my niece for her birthday, but the quality is so bad.<br />The prints are just stickers, I am pretty sure it will peel out in the first washing.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.<br />Amazon should not sell this cheap quality product."
1.0,"Great strap if your 8 ft tall. Very disappointed. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù tall and with the strap shortened all the way, my ukulele hangs down below my belly button. Should have known better. Would not recommend"
1.0,this is korean Traditional han bok  not a chinese hanfu you better change name don't try to steel korean anything ok
1.0,"This suit is so small, I am petite 4'9&#34; and less than 100lbs and I couldn't get this thing on! I do have a large chest but there was NO give to this suit to get it on. I am returning for this reason, it looks just like the picture and is cute but be aware this runs really small!"
1.0,"Boot is not very well made, the flaps are uneven causing pressure on top of foot. The first pair ordered were too small, despite me ordering a half size larger. I had to exchange for a size 9 which still are not that comfortable. Poor quality for what they cost."
1.0,This dress is horrible.  No fitting to it. Just a sack with arms
1.0,Bags shoulder strap broke first time I used it.
1.0,I purchased this necklace in gold to wear with an evening gown.  It would have been the perfect accessory but the hinge broke before I got a chance to wear it. I returned it for a refund.
1.0,"Dude, I can‚Äôt even rate this dress because the dress I received looked nothing like the picture. I sent it back immediately."
1.0,The picture very clearly shows a person with their hand the pocket. I read the description it doesn't say anything about there not being pockets. I NEED POCKETS!!!!!!!!!!!! Very unhappy.
1.0,"this was suppose to be a gift and runs super small,,terrible workmanship"
1.0,The bottom of this sweater looks like it was chewed by mice. Hideous. The royal blue is pretty and the fabric is warm with some stretch. The zipper is cute. But the cut is boxy and it is shorter than expected. And the hemline makes it look like it was rescued from the rag bin.
1.0,I was wearing this product as a mask while hairdressing the fabric is very light but kept falling down And when talking and breathing the fabric sucks into your mouth i guess it would be ok just around your neck.  I'll keep them for a neck warmer for winter that's it.
1.0,Something about this filter gave us painful GI cramps. I returned
1.0,"I wanted to love this dress: fabric is thick, color is vibrant, design is suitable for work, but something about its fit was not right: I did not feel looking good in it. Returned."
1.0,"Cheap, thin, fits more like a tshirt."
1.0,"Materiales sint√©ticos, no son de piel como lo publicaron"
1.0,My kid is 7 years old and needed the glasses. He loves to play and watch TV. I thought that this product was unbreakable but the frame on the bottom part of the right lense broke
1.0,"Junk, fell apart in 1 month. Just outside of return window."
1.0,My order just arrived!!! I was so excited! I opened the small beautifully wrapped box and then Ugh!!!! The necklace is broken and unusable! Very disappointed!!!
1.0,I got my package delivered yesterday I put the piercing on and this morning I got up with my nose all green
1.0,"Thought it would be made of cotton, not some synthetic blend. It is also very cheaply made"
1.0,Received order today and it came missing the clip to attach it to the watch leaving it useless.  Not happy.
1.0,I had JUST opened my package after letting it a it in the garage with Lysol on it due to the virus. I was very excited to open it up and use it for a cosplay shoot I planned on doing at home. BUT to my surprise I look at the straps and the hemming in the back. ITS ALL RIPPED AND THE STRAPS AREN'T EVEN ATTACHED TO THE DRESS. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. and I had read so many good reviews too. Wouldn't buy this unless you don't mind the possibility of receiving a dress you have to fix up üôÑ
1.0,it's ugly style.
1.0,Literally impare vision to the point of not being wearable! D:
1.0,I checked the neck label on my old loved night gown for maker.  It was a  med/lge.  I have gained weight so ordered the xlge.  It's a tent.  Really wanted to love it but had to return.
1.0,Girlfriend bought this for me. Was too big. I have average sized wrists but it almost fell off every time my arms was hanging down. So I tried taking a bead off to make it smalller but it's practically impossible to fix
1.0,"After wearing the robe about 6-8 times, the inside string ripped.  I can no longer tie it together.  Very disappointing."
1.0,Cheap tshirt. Not at all what‚Äôs shown
1.0,"Will be returning, dress is sloppy looking and very long, great color green though<br /><br />Update: got a dress a size down, still way too long and sloppy. I would look for a different dress"
1.0,Didnt Run Very Long I Think Battery Was Old.
1.0,"Color is less pink and more yellow. Dress is VERY wrinkly, small around the chest and extremely big on the waist and below."
1.0,The whole back of the polo had tiny pulls in the material. My fault I didn't notice it at first. Unable to return.<br />Very disappointed!!!!!
1.0,screw came out after a week
1.0,"This is not ur typical fleece sweat pants. The inside feels like cardboard, too uncomfortable to wear."
1.0,This is a long flat cloth. Must know how to do different wraps styles. It may work for some.
1.0,"After waiting 3 additional days for delivery, imagine my surprise and disappointment when I took the shoes out of the box and one is defective! My daughter is upset that she won‚Äôt have them to wear for daycare tomorrow and I‚Äôm annoyed that this wasn‚Äôt checked before it was packed up and shipped. It doesn‚Äôt even look like the strip was made long enough for the shoe! Very poorly made!"
1.0,I barely even ware it and it started to turn my wrist green.
1.0,Careful when wash and drying....tassels tangle badly
1.0,"I ordered the size I always wear, too small!"
1.0,"Dress does not match the photos. I purchased the pink striped dress with pink buttons. The buttons that arrived were brown instead, and the top stitching of the upper bust was much shorter than in the photos. Dress is also almost completely transparent."
1.0,My daughter got this for Christmas and it broke before a month had passed.
1.0,"Muy mala calidad, no vale la pena üëéüèº"
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt stay up on my 6 year old.
1.0,"These socks are a huge disappointment considering they got 4 stars from 102 reviews.<br /><br />Most people want a sock that is soft and comfortable. A sock that hugs your foot. This sock is rough, loose and uncomfortable."
1.0,This product is advertised as sterling silver but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs cheap junk that changes color. False advertising.
1.0,"The Wings were nice, despite one being broken. The actual helmet though was crudely painted with spots missing paint. The visor if you wish to call it that I don't know what the actual name is, folds over in a thick and unflattering way that is not visible from the pictures provided. In my opinion not worth the price, and the only positive I could give it were the wings that looked incredible but like I said were broken."
1.0,"When I opened the package I was excited, it‚Äôs really cute. I tried it on and I was happy until I turned around, the backside of the swimsuit bottoms are pretty sheer and you could see everything üò¨, I returned them."
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt as comfortable as I expected.
1.0,Not plus size at all.
1.0,"I ware a size 10.5 so I ordered a size 11 thinking that it would fit, but it was so small I couldn't get the toe in. I ended up giving them to a girl with size 9.5 shoe, and they fit her perfectly!"
1.0,Has damaged
1.0,It‚Äôs not good quality
1.0,not what I thought at all.
1.0,"Changed my star rating. Sorry, I don't like to give one star but, Nice color nice fit. Hard to see in pic but  but it came torn in one place and coming apart under arm area. Asking for a replacement.. Been 10 day's and no refund or replacement."
1.0,Your band is not very sturdy... I lost my Fitbit and had to buy a new one!
1.0,"I was so excited to get this sweater but it just was not at all what I was hoping! I thought the button design would be neat but it's extremely uncomfortable and itchy at the neck. It doesnt fit at all and one sleeve is at least 4 inches shorter than the other sleeve. it fits fine in the torso but it was just badly made and horribly uncomfortable! It runs small as well. I ordered a 3x so that it would be extremely loose and comfortable but it is super snug. The only plus is that the material is a little soft. The packaging was badly done too. It came balled up and unfolded with an odd odor to it. I'm so sorry to give a bad review, but I was super upset to receive this item when I expected it to be something nice. :("
1.0,As another reviewer noted - the grip material on the top of the bra created burn like marks and blisters - I'm missing some skin after wearing it.
1.0,While the product is of quality and the pattern is fun. These masks are too small for my 7 years old! So unusable which is unfortunate.
1.0,STAY AWAY...Absolute useless. The touch is non responsive after you put the protector screen. You have to press hard for touch and it gives a click sound. Total waste of money.
1.0,"Horrible and cheap material. Period, nothing else to say about it."
1.0,"This shirt was such a disappointment. To start with, it is at least one size too big. Plus, it is so long that even a size down wouldn't have been the right length. It is awkwardly long for the design. On top of this, the colors are drab; not at all like pictured. It was returned!"
1.0,"Runs extremely small, cheap material"
1.0,This product came two sizes larger than advertised and cheap material
1.0,"This dress looks nothing like the picture. The color, the material, the style, literally nothing. The buttons are fake which would be fine if they didn‚Äôt look so cheap. The material is pretty thick and comfortable, but the picture makes it look similar to linen(my fault for not looking into that further). It is also more of a baby pink and very ill fitting. The v neck part was sewn very poorly and this dress isn‚Äôt even worth $5. My dress would have looked a little better with the tie I feel but apparently they forgot to include it with my package. It looks awful and there‚Äôs no way I can make it work. Very disappointed, but amazon clothes are hit or miss for the most part. This was DEFINITELY a miss."
1.0,I don't if was because of Christmas but I was supposed to receive this by Christmas and I didn't very disappointed so be careful it might take longer to get it then it says
1.0,"This purse is beautiful but very poorly made. It already came apart just unpacking it, the handle came off the hook, threads are out and easy to pull off. Not at all what I expected by the reviews."
1.0,Not for fat feet
1.0,Ordered xxL reviewed xxL How ever it was no where near that size. I may classify as a XXS.  Very upset!
1.0,"poor quality. Runs small, the sleeves disintegrated in the washer."
1.0,Weird material and was too large
1.0,My order said a package of 3 wee wow fortune bracelets. When it came it was 1 bracket and 2 LOL surprises. I was not notified there was a change in the order.
1.0,"I ordered up in size, but the material was flawed and the decorative print was like an iron on vs woven. Cute shirt, but poorly made & poor quality."
1.0,It's cute but cheap material.
1.0,"Wore it to work and it was heavy and big on me (5'5""). My coworker made fun of me. Looked like I was the meat market butcher. The texture was like it too."
1.0,Shire is stretchy and heavy. Feels scratchy on skin
1.0,Ordered a XXL. The shirt was very short
1.0,I didn‚Äôt like the fit maybe I had the wrong size.
1.0,Not soft at all!!!
1.0,The daughter piece does not come on a chain. It's on a keyring and that solely defeated the purpose of this purchase.
1.0,They gave zero support!
1.0,Leather around the pockets fell apart and also string ripped when I slightly put force to take it out of my bag. I had to stitch it
1.0,HyperFavor would not email me back. I will never order anything ever again from HyperFavor!!!!
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy. As soon as we opened the box the tank was already broken at the straps. Super lame.
1.0,It was a nice wallet but wrong color thus I was disappointed and sent it back
1.0,No features no product
1.0,I see threads come out after 10 minutes of use. I am returning the product.
1.0,O K
1.0,"I ordered half a size larger than usual (I‚Äôm a size 9)  just to insure that they‚Äôd fit. Well these literally fit like a 6.5. The shape is so angled, who has feet shaped like that ? No one. That‚Äôs who. I can‚Äôt even get my toes in the front straps ?? UGH. Waste of time and money. Will return for a full refund. Be ware. Order at your own risk."
1.0,Very fragile. I dropped my keys and the skull shattered into three pieces
1.0,I bought this for my girl she's a Sailor Moon fan but she said that it was a little hard to breathe out of
1.0,"Does not work. Great in commercials, but not in reality"
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!!!<br />The shirt has thread coming out. One of the fishnet gloves were ripped. Cheaply made!<br />QUESTION: Why does the shirt stink so bad?<br />I would return but I‚Äôm not paying to return something that‚Äôs not my fault. RIDICULOUS!!!!!
1.0,Feel like paper. I do not like it and to cheep to send back. I gave it to the girl scouts. Very dissatisfied!
1.0,WAYYYYY to long. I would have to get this professionally hemmed. I returned it.
1.0,Entire shoulder seam was torn. Didn‚Äôt notice until I threw away packaging. Not nearly as cute as picture. I‚Äôd buy something else.
1.0,Returned this item. Smaller than I expected.
1.0,this came from china; Broken; Junk
1.0,"I bought this product to re-stain a faded leather dog collar made by Zep-Pro. The collar was in great condition except for the fading. I followed the application instructions and allowed a day for the dye to dry. Unfortunately, the dyed collar discolored the dog‚Äôs white hair around his neck, so I cannot use the collar any longer...not good."
1.0,"The fit is true to size. However, it does not stick as soon as you move it comes off."
1.0,"Poor quality, uncomfortable scratchy material - returning AND they charge you to return via UPS."
1.0,It fell apart the first hour I had it on.
1.0,The buttons were completely off.
1.0,We just couldn‚Äôt wait to put them on. Well sadly we had to take them right back off! Way too big for her and not very sturdy
1.0,"Our sone loved it, but after 1 use it came unsowed at the ear part."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt fit like expected
1.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, especially because it's a gorgeous color made of lovely fabric.  However, it is just cut very weird and is not attractive on a plus size woman.  I am 5'3 and it is at least 6 inches too long. I tried two different sizes and both of them looked oddly large on me, but then really tight in the bust, and made my back look much fatter than it is.  I think this was because of how clingy the fabric is."
1.0,The chest area was way too high did not fit at all it was horrible
1.0,It broke in the package was upset but I fixed it
1.0,Disappointed.  Cheaply made and very inflexible.
1.0,Ridiculous design. Sorry I bought this [for my wife]. It is in the trash.
1.0,"5'5"" and 140lbs and these were too small, too tight, and cut off circulation to my thighs.  (Though I didn't ride with them, I feel they would not have covered my butt bones well enough). Womp womp."
1.0,"I have purchased two of these bracelets, love the look, size and sparkle, but both broke within 2-3 weeks of wear. I tried to give the product the benefit of the doubt and purchased a second without even returning the first. It broke in the exact same place. Sadly back these go, while I  resume my search for a great bracelet."
1.0,Never order again
1.0,"Bought this for my 13 year old. It lasted less than 24 hours. The minute she attempted to take it off before her shower this morning, it broke. Not fantastic."
1.0,"I've had this strap for a couple months.  It was good at first, but stretches out.  It's now barely wearable since the clasp is all the way in, and it's getting looser.  I wouldn't buy again."
1.0,In good faith I spent way too much money on this ring - described by seller as excellent for use as ring to hold dog ID tags. Check out the photo. It does not work as a dog tag ring. At all. Thankfully I didn't lose the ID tags.
1.0,"Horrible quality and horrible customer service.  Very cheap material and fits in an awkward way.  Requested a return and got this response &#34;hi friend,we have size table in our Product Details show,we want close the request&#34;.  Because they have a size chart, which I followed, they won't issue a return.  I order from Amazon quite a bit, and this is the worst purchase I have ever made."
1.0,The devil horns don't stand up.  The hair looks like a shaggy mess...nothing like the sleek look on the model.
1.0,The jewels fail off the first time I tried to wear it!
1.0,Can you imagine being hype to get a good deal and see this... explains why it was so cheap.
1.0,Look to cheap
1.0,"The material is very thin and see through. There was no tag in the pair I received so I could not verify that the sizing I was sent was actually a 5x per the manufacturer. Assuming it was correct, these were so small that they fit my teenager who normally wears a small/medium in pants. I would only recommend them for wearing as PJ bottoms due to the sheerness of them."
1.0,"Bad material, I wasted my money"
1.0,Didn‚Äôt like broke as soon as I tried putting on
1.0,"These pants are extremely unflattering. The material feels like a jacket its so thick. Because of the thickness of the fabric,  its not an ideal summer pant. It also doesnt lay flat on the legs...I<br />It looks like Rose Nyland in that episode of Golden Girls where she's testing out fat sucking pants with a vacuum."
1.0,If you looking for polarized lenses these are not polarized at all.<br />Compared to any other polarized glasses i own these are very poor.
1.0,"These arrived about 1.5"" inches shorter than any of my same sized other-brand similar foot wear. Returned immediately. Made in China but not for U.S. sizing."
1.0,"I was excited to have purchased a pack of 4 bright colors - the first time we used one, the side of the buckle cracked and the strap broke off - just one trip!"
1.0,"Wore these twice, turned my fingers green and the rings were tarnished/green/rusty looking. They are really cute, but I only wore them twice and now I can't wear them anymore :(  If you're buying for a festival, these are great, cuz they'll look super cute for the weekend, but you won't be able to wear them again after that."
1.0,Broke within a week. Not worth the money. Bummer because it's cute
1.0,The product is completely different quality than the picture shows. The smell is weird and the quality is low and the return process is a hassle. very disappointing.
1.0,These are very large (not why the one star review). The back of the earrings would not stay on causing them to not stay in my daughter's ears.
1.0,"The legs are very baggy, and it is not flattering at all."
1.0,El palito de atr√°s es muy largo y molesta demaciado
1.0,Doesn't hang right on ears.
1.0,So disappointed In this. I wish I never bought it
1.0,Terrible. Cheap. Don't waste your money.  Ear piece broke off before I could even wear them.
1.0,I am 5‚Äô10 and ordered a M...was not long enough and was see-through.
1.0,I  wear a 42 f cup bra. Ordered this bra was suppose to fit a 42 d-g it maybe would of fit a high b cup maybe a low c.
1.0,The only way these could be knee high socks would to be worn by a child or someone who has legs the size of a child.  These socks fit like a high ankle sock on me.<br />Very disappointed!
1.0,"The dress came apart on first wear, disappointed. The zipper is defective."
1.0,"Pretty but so cheap. The hook part bent so easily while trying to put them on. Sucks, cause I loved the heart hoops."
1.0,Guess its cheap for a reason. I bought as a gift and barely put a few things in there and the zipper started acting funny. It should zip up correctly wasn't trying to put to much stuff in there. Dont waste your money
1.0,These are not real Hematite. Barely fits my 4 year old (see pic) . WILL NOT FIT ADULTS.  First time I am really upset about false advertising.
1.0,I was expecting thre red to look like the picture but I'm very disappointed.I ordered these to match a 50's style dress I have but the red is actually more burgundy and doesn't look at all like the picture.
1.0,"Very nice looking watch, estpecially for the price. Only issue is that was very hard to take out and out back the pins when removing links. Always do it myself as have the tolls but needed small pliers to remove them after getting out a little bit and small hammer to put them back. We‚Äôll see if keeps time correctly when in a watch winder.<br /><br />Update - loses time in watch winder after a while which I could live with given the price,  but losing time while wearing not acceptable so returning. Guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,I loved this in the picture... unfortunately the size is not right even for children. Soooooo tight and uncomfortable!!! Fabric very thin.
1.0,I feel like my daughter has a normal sized head. But this had was insanely small. Had to return it.
1.0,"Terrible quality, see-through, and not worth the money. Sending back."
1.0,These did not fit and they did not have in a larger size. So disappointing.
1.0,Piece of CRAP!  The backs just slide right off as soon as you put them in.  Very unhappy
1.0,Smells of dog urine. I bought 2 shirts they both stink. I ordered them again and the second set was worse than the 1st. Imagine getting out of the shower to put on a stank pee shirt. Don't waist your time or money.
1.0,"Just got this one, looks pretty good, but it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm going to return it tomorrow!!"
1.0,It broke within a week and I asked for a new one and the company declined
1.0,"It's a pretty necklace, but it isn't well made. After just a few days, three of the gems fell out."
1.0,Fits very tight across the shoulders. Very snug tailoring for a sweatshirt.
1.0,Doesn't Fit
1.0,"No place to add filter, too thin for protection"
1.0,Cheap material and was way too small. Returned it.
1.0,From the waist up it was too small/short.and the g-string section was almost a foot too long.
1.0,Size 9 is like a size 5<br />Size 10 is like a size 6 and so on and so forth. They run super small. Don't fit at all.
1.0,Slot one failed about 2 years in slot 2 3 months later. So just over 2 years in down to 50% working.... not worth $200 and was under light use so poorly built.
1.0,Pin fell out and didn‚Äôt work
1.0,Looks very cheap. Never wore
1.0,Love the jacket but the zipper broke a week after I got it. Amazon sent a new one and that zipper broke as well. So disappointed
1.0,Im so disappointed with these sweats! I had ordered other colors and they were not polyester. This material is horrible !
1.0,Horrible material<br />Bunches up doesn't wick at all
1.0,"Cheaply made, crooked, not worth the price. I sent them back."
1.0,The hoop was way to big for my nose!
1.0,"This is a beautiful dress, the sizing and color are spot on. The softness of the fabric feels great.  I am 5' 6'' , 145lbs and a 36 B. I ordered a large.  The problem, however, is the fabric fibers ball-up just from simply rubbing it. It's as if someone took Velcro to the fabric and then pulled on it.  I am having it replaced. Hopefully the next one will not have the same issue.  I will up-date this in a few days.  Oh, I also tried to leave a message for the seller but apparently they are having issues on their end of receiving it.....uh huh...<br />UPDATE: Received new dress today and could tell by not even taking it out of the packaging that the fabric fibers were the same.  Very poor quality and would look 20years old even BEFORE the first wash.  To bad really, it's a beautiful design..."
1.0,"This item is very stylest but it‚Äôs not fitted to get on my watch, this keeps sliding off. I don‚Äôt recommend this item Because it does not clip in."
1.0,It was favored more of a praise dance dress and I was not looking for that. The material is thin. I was looking for a casual work dress. This was a miss.
1.0,Straps are way too long. Ridiculous. And I have D boobs and am 5 foot 8 and the small has the longest straps ever
1.0,About fell off me. Returned it next day
1.0,They said in the description that the were suede which is what most jewelry clothes look like. These are the smooth finished cloths that you‚Äôd use to clean glasses.  They Do Not clean and polish metals like a Jewelry Cloth would  JUNK
1.0,Daughter ordered a pair and hers were nice like picture. I ordered a pair and this is what I got. Cheap knock offs not even real suede. I Will be returning them today.
1.0,Not worth the cost
1.0,Good material but having owned countless pairs of 32 length pants I am comfortable saying that these are flawed and far to short. Traditional 32 inseam has a break based on my height and these are just plain short. Not happy.
1.0,The frames were bent and lenses were scratched.  They are falling off my face and not a good copy at all.  I was not able to return these.  Buyers be careful they do not do returns. Not even remotely nice and I have purchased several sunglass from Amazon.
1.0,Went off the size chart(I got an xl) and they are really small!!!! I will be surprised if they fit my sister who is a sz med!!!!!!
1.0,"I was very unhappy with this costume.  It came with seams that were not sewn correctly so there were 3 holes that I needed to repair.  The materials was exceptionally flimsy and tissue paper thin.  The pants were much smaller than the jacket, so I needed to buy a different pair of navy pants for the costume.  The only reason I didn‚Äôt return it was because I didn‚Äôt have enough time to get another costume for my teenager before Halloween so I fixed the jacket and she used that with different pants."
1.0,They are NOT true to size. Too small. And the quality is thin and cheap fabric. I've order 2 different sizes and returned them both. The color didn't match the advertise color.
1.0,Wouldn‚Äôt even stick to me longer than 5 minutes and I used alcohol on my skin before I applied it
1.0,"The face is attractive and appropriately sized for a nice modern looking watch. The reason for the one stars is it has stopped keeping time after 5 months or so. It's not the battery unfortunately. The band is extremely cheap, which is OK because its the cheapest watch I've ever purchased. I don't know why they put pig leather in the description, but basically its a thick underlying synthetic with a thin piece of what might be pig leather stitched on top. The hands did glow fairly bright. All in all, I guess if you really like the look but happen to loose 3-4 watches a year, this might be a cost effective purchase. However I don't need to add any more broken watches to my collection."
1.0,"Very disappointed with this coat. It arrived with a tear around both waist sinch holes, the pockets are fake and the fake pocket snaps don‚Äôt have anything to even snap into."
1.0,The bow felt after one used
1.0,"The band looked great when I received it.  I have worn it about a week, not in water, and the white finish is coming off to show a bluish purple color underneath.  Can you replace the band?"
1.0,Ordered XL but fit like a medium. And the sleeves yes are way too tight. Thought it was a girl's fitted shirt when I put it on
1.0,fit my preteen.....it was a size XL....
1.0,They sewed the top so you can't even read what it says.  Really disappointed....I thought it would be smooth like pictures and be able to read it.  Returning this asap
1.0,This is terrible . It is difficult to put on
1.0,This hurt my daith piercing so bad I took it out and threw it in the trash after 48 hours.  Stick to the round daith ring.
1.0,"I placed my order on August 21, 2018 and received it within a week.  I put away the blouse didn't try it on until the night before I had planned to wear it.  So on the day of the event, I put on the blouse and noticed the collar was not right.  Nevertheless, I wore it hoping it was not that noticeable, but it was, several unpleasant comments were made, and that's why I'm writing this review.  My return window was past due.  Does Dokotoo have quality control?  The quality of this blouse it not acceptable, the collar is oversized, twisted, and hangs.  I'm hoping that Dokotoo replaces my blouse, I gladly return the damaged blouse.  I'm out of pocket because I don't have any intentions of wearing this blouse again.  Please try on and review your merchandise ASAP.  JJimenez-El Paso, TX"
1.0,They fit perfect but they are very cheap made I bought a 3 pack and first time I put them on the crouch ripped out of al of them very cheap keep! Save your money don't buy theses
1.0,"These tops has no compression at all. One of my worst Amazon purchse yet. I suggest you buy small even if you weigh almost 200lbs, then you might end up getting a better deal than me."
1.0,"I bought these two outfits for my granddaughter for the 4th. My daughter sent me a picture if what she actually received. It was embarrassing to me that I actually send these terrible, cheap, wrinkled, ill fitted, not what the pictures or descriptions shiwed at all. The pants does but look like the pictures, the small outfit is more like a bathing suit than a top and bottom. Why us this happening? I did not choose the cheap outfits since I know they come from China. These were not cheap, but they still cane from China. I would have returned them but my daughter already washed them and threw the packing material away. Amazon should make sure where the items they sell come from. I will never but any other outfits from Amazon ever again"
1.0,"Beware -NOT JADE - probably colored glass,the color bleeds into the skin. Also,it's not any shade of purple,more dark red."
1.0,I wouldnt even bother getting it unless you are the size of a toothpick.
1.0,"After 3 months I was putting these on and noticed a hole in them.  Mind you, I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and weigh 120 lbs, so these were somewhat big on me.  I have had leggings that have lasted over 10 years; in fact, this is the first pair of leggings that have ever gotten a hole in them."
1.0,Look kinda big on your feet and the soles are slick and will cause you to slip and fall if you dont put nonstick pads on the bottom. I even invested in shoe goo and nonstick pads. Wouldn't buy again
1.0,"shoe is not cut to size, you will need to go up a size or size and 1/2."
1.0,Sizing chart said XL=US M so I took an XL because I normally wear medium. It was way too small. Very disappointed
1.0,The material is super slinky so its very clingy.  After one wash the straps in the front of the shirt go twisted and stretched now the shirt is basically garbage after one wear.  Don't waste your money on this!
1.0,"Very disappointed, but that's just me, you may have different opinion!!!"
1.0,"The finish, whatever it is, starts wearing off almost immediately. Luckily, it looks horrible even before the return-by date, so it's going back."
1.0,It was so big on me ! It looked like a sheet.. go down a size or 2 and wear a cute belt or it will look like some pajamas !
1.0,"extremely bad shape, fabric sags from different places, making the look very cheap."
1.0,Glasses arrived missing a screw..
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt polish or shine. Thin and low quality.
1.0,"The coat was nothing like the picture and i am very disappointed. it‚Äôs not as puffy, the fur is red not grayish white like shown in the display picture and also did not come attached to coat already, the zippers do not include the zipper decorations that are also shown in the display picture. All around disappointment with this coat. Coat is nothing like what is show on described in the description."
1.0,Rcvd in timely manner. Picked it up and went to put on and the bracelet snapped and beads went everywhere. Very poor string/elastic holding it together. Told seller and wanted pictures. Beads were all over my deck and yard so that wasn't going to happen. Poor design and customer service. You would have thought I was talking and a 5000.00 bracelet. Beware.
1.0,Broke the first time i wore it. I loved it too :(
1.0,Nice design but not made for small wrist
1.0,"Material was really thin, returned"
1.0,Product runs extremely small and unusual breast vs hip sizing.
1.0,I wasn't even a week before the Chakra part came apart from the necklace
1.0,Looks cheap. I didn‚Äôt wear it. I suppose I could return it or send to my nieces for dressup
1.0,"This is the most disgusting coat I have ever had. It took a while to discover all the annoying features, so I didn't feel I could return it! What are those large velcro straps on the end of the sleeves? You have to use them, because the sleeve opening is jumbo. You have to remove this coat, or don't try to reach much off of the store shelf, because these straps catch on everything. Then there's the shoulder straps....they're there so you can't get your purse off your shoulder without a struggle. Those pockets ! you have to reach up and over to get anything in, or out, of these pockets- very odd angle. and the lining is pilled. This will go in the trash when spring is here."
1.0,Got my shirt today and it has a one inch tear on it. Very displeased.
1.0,Too big and no easy way to remove links. Poor choice.
1.0,I ordered a Small and the tag says One Size. It is at least 3x too big. The material is also very thin - spanx would be required or else it is completely see through
1.0,"For the price, you should be expecting high quality item. Returned the first item since the quality of stitching is not good. Got a replacement quick. Same issue."
1.0,Do notbuy it
1.0,1 feather is noticably longer than the other.
1.0,Order TWO sizes up
1.0,Its was broke
1.0,"It broke after about 2 months of use (used it about once a week).  Locked my helmet to my sissy bar and later could not unlock it.  Had to ride home without the helmet on.  At home, it took me a small crew driver and about 3 minutes to break the lock, just by inserting the screw driver between the gaps of the lock and loosening the lock connection. I expected this helmet lock to lock/unlock every time and to not be so easy to break into.... wrong twice."
1.0,Broke immediately after putting on
1.0,This purse is not real leather and I am 99 percent sure it is fake. Don't buy it!
1.0,"It worked fine for the first month or so, but maybe the southern heat or winter got to it and now it goes off pace 10min after I set it."
1.0,I bought a different style by the same maker that was fabulous so I bought this one.  This one is so cheap looking.  Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,smaller than your pinky fingernail. it's cute but I wouldn't buy again.
1.0,The description says they are gemstones this is not true I was very excited to receive these but the plastic beads are already cracked and scratch very sad
1.0,"Ordered a men‚Äôs XL, but it barely fit my daughter (size 4)!!  Disappointing."
1.0,Super light material<br />Definitely not worth $20!!!!!
1.0,"Material too thin, they ran like pantyhose do and then I got a hole???"
1.0,It was poor quality. The white designer is made from rubber. Also the small size is to large. The company doesn‚Äôt have extra small.
1.0,I looked forward to having these sandals because they looked different from all the other sandals on the market. When I got them they looked great and felt great on my feet. I was trying them out around the house when the heel strap came loose from the elastic. What a disappointment! Now I'm afraid to buy that brand at all.
1.0,"Very poor quality, do not waste your money."
1.0,"This garment was way too small. I order one size up from my normal size after reading the previous reviews. Even if it fit I wouldn't even attempt to wear it as it had an over powering odor of chemical/rubber. It made me wheeze just taking it out of the package. Not manufactured in the USA, so it's anyone's guess what is in it. Would NOT recommend."
1.0,The material of shirt was great but the decal was horible
1.0,Stupid thing broke the first time I wore them
1.0,TERRIBLE. SO CHEAP SIZES ARE WRONG. MADE FOR AN AWKWARD BODY
1.0,"I WORE IT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, AND IT TURNED BLACK"
1.0,"These boots lasted my daughter all of one month before they started following apart from the inside out. I had to throw them away, do yourself a favor and order a better quality pair."
1.0,"Terrible!! I wouldn't recommend. I bought them for my wife. And not even 2 days into use, the color chipped off and infected her ear. Wasted money!!"
1.0,"I've tried and tried to find a mask that fits like the picture shows for this mask, under the chin and over<br />the nose. They always fall short giving a narrow area of protection that you must consciously maintain<br />yourself as they're always too small to encompass your chin!"
1.0,"Hash such high hopes, really doesn‚Äôt look like the picture, the v neck is really high, the arms are tight and the body is kind of wide, but the color is the worst, kind of a mind and grass green not like the picture.. it will be going back."
1.0,Was not a wide lanyard and did not have the metal charm. Will not purchase again or from this seller.
1.0,Glasses were extremely small. Can fit a child! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1.0,It‚Äôs waterproof up to the moment you moment you sumberge your hand into the sink to clean some dishes.
1.0,These are NOT high waisted at all!! These fit right at hips
1.0,"Front has the image, back is completely white.  So when they are being worn, there is a white strip on the side and back of your legs.  Odd!  Why didn't they just sublimate both sides of this sock?  I would gladly pay a few extra dollars for double sided."
1.0,I only gave this one star because it broke the first time that I wore it.  I ordered the orange one it was very cute. I had planned on purchasing this in two more colors. I‚Äôm glad that I didn‚Äôt order them before I wore this one.
1.0,"The color and appearance is beautiful, but chain is very fragile, it broke within 2 weeks."
1.0,"Does not look or fit like the picture. As soon as it put it on, the side unraveled and it just kept getting bigger no matter how careful i tried to be with it. The material is soft but thats as good as it get. Theres no way you can even call it an off the shoulder top, the neck opening is too small and its super tight at the bottom. Im 5'4, 140 pounds so im not a big girl. It should not have been that tight. I"
1.0,The seams and lines of fabric do not line up leaving an unpleasant and sloppy look.
1.0,"This is not the bag I received. I did get a blue bag that has blemishes and its also patent/shiny, is smaller than the dimensions in the description and is not studded and has gold hardware...."
1.0,it arrived with the clasp broken. it will close but it will not stay closed and falls off when i try to wear it
1.0,Unfortunately doesn‚Äôt actually fit any glasses I tried 5 different pairs and the opening is too small!!! If I could give zero stars and still write a review I would!!! Super cute and useless
1.0,My daughter likes these earrings
1.0,This item is nothing like I thought it was. I am very unhappy and it broke the first time I used it. They want me to return it for a refund but I couldn't because it broke when I wasn't at home and I had to leave. Do not buy.
1.0,I ordered the correct size but shoes were too large.
1.0,Sizing is inaccurate.  Much smaller than scaling chart indicates.  4xxxx is equivalent to a teens size 12.
1.0,I absolutely hated this product it turned my neck and wrist pink smh couldn't get it off for days very upset considering I was Dyed pink and it was my birthday weekend
1.0,It didnt work .
1.0,Well..sometimes u need to go with your reg. favorite shopping store( AERIE) for clothes but I was in a hurryüèñ and so again I bought for the speed and was disappointedüò± This LOOKS BEAUTIFUL and FEELS it too! But all else about it stinksüêΩ it SHLD B a FALL OFF YOUR SHOULDER TYPE of SWEATSHIRT instead it feels like your wearing an AWKWARD SQUARE with 2 MISSHAPEN ARM HOLES.
1.0,The back piece that attached to the back of the pants was broke and didn‚Äôt hold. I‚Äôm returning.
1.0,"They arrived broken, bent, and missing stones floating around the bottom of the plastic packaging. Two had missing stones, 3 had bent prongs. They are being returned as they are obviously very flimsy. You get what you pay for."
1.0,Bought these glasses about 2 months ago. Today just putting them on my face the frames snapped in 2 places. I wasn't even being hard on them or anything. VERY cheap product not worth the $10. I've got more use out of $2 pair from the liquor store.
1.0,"So cheap, so tacky. It is made of thin, see through material. The stitching is crooked. It‚Äôs tiny! I‚Äôm usually a small and got a medium and it‚Äôs still too small. Just don‚Äôt waste your time or money. It‚Äôs bad."
1.0,Very disappointed. Pretty to look at but will not stay on my glasses frames
1.0,Swimsuit strap tore the first time I wore it.  Looked cute in pic but didn't last at all
1.0,Quality is not good and the color is not the shade shown in the images.
1.0,These bracelets are very poor quality. The majority of the pack fell apart 2 minutes after they were distributed. They are cheap but NOT worth a dime. Too bad they were supposed to be really nice gifts for students on a school retreat.
1.0,No sizing chart it was literally a guessing game they show a child but they were adult sizes
1.0,"The bottom is too small, top is too large. Had to return."
1.0,There very cheap and not all worth buying
1.0,These were too thin to keep a bany crawling on cold floor warm.
1.0,Sizes don't match
1.0,Far more sheer material than appears in picture. Ordered a size larger but it was still several inches from being capable of closing.
1.0,My 2 year old broke them in seconds...
1.0,I use these type of gloves in the delivery service that I am in. The gloves that I have gotten from the local stores have usually lasted a couple months or more with daily useage. However the gloves that I received here lost the the gripping dots the first day of use and had wore holes through within a week. Pure garbage product my opinion will not purchase from this vendor again. Save your money and do not purchase these gloves here.
1.0,I bought this one but i had to return it because it keep falling of my wrist.<br />I have another one from a different brand .- and it works good.
1.0,did not fit the frames
1.0,"Very cheap , fit was awful"
1.0,Damaged product would like new order sent or refund
1.0,fade very quick and stitching started to come out
1.0,"its for church<br />doesn't look elegant as the picture showed at all, looks real cheapy cheapy"
1.0,The material wasn't what I expected too hot to be for summer
1.0,I received this product for my 13 year old but they are sized for a toddler.  :-/
1.0,I thought the chain would have been longer. On the picture it look longer.
1.0,I wish I could return this product. It was way too small for me and the chart specified it was my size.  Hate it
1.0,"I wish I heeded the warnings from other sellers. I also wish I could return them! I wonder what type of business can get away with creating a product that does not have correct sizing. For someone that usually wears a medium, I ordered the xxxl and one pair fit. The other 5 pairs are wayyyy too small. What's up with the size variations?!?  What a waste of $20!"
1.0,Purchased this on May 13 and it‚Äôs now May 25. As you can see it totally discolored. Loved it but it got ruined to fast.
1.0,Smells (and feels) like plastic tablecloth. I will be returning it.
1.0,"Not made in USA, so the sizes are run small.  How small? Charts supplied are no help.  I ordered 3 in xx large, so that it should fit a person who is a X large .  One I couldn't  get on at all, felt like a small, the second one fit like a medium and the third felt like a large.  I gave them away to family member.  I really like the style but I would need an xxx large and l wouldn't take the chance in it fitting crapy."
1.0,Only wore this once and it broke on the first attempt. Sad because I really liked the style and look.
1.0,"Cute concept but the lettering was already peeling when I got it. I bought it on sale and it wasn‚Äôt worth my time and effort to return it, but it was very poor quality."
1.0,Arm ripped off first my 85 lb son tried to climb in it.
1.0,Fabric was cheap and terrible and broke almost instantly. It fits great hut I'm a 36DD and it didnt fit my breast area at all...I got an XL and the larger wouldn't fit well and would be to baggy.
1.0,If you have a normal sized head‚Ä¶this costume will NOT fit!!  Save your money!!
1.0,Did not fit at all. Did not look like in the picture.
1.0,HUGE dress. Wasn't wearable and I ordered a small. Fit more like a large.
1.0,Horrible.. Theh weren't glow in the dark.. they looked nothing like what I ordered
1.0,I didn‚Äôt get it
1.0,"Too small, listed as xl don't believe."
1.0,the material was too thin. it felt like i didnt have support which is very unusual since that is what i buy and wear. they have been returned
1.0,"I would give this zero stars if I could. Sure it fits as expected, but don‚Äôt worry about that- they ripped with ONE use. Every single one!!! Don‚Äôt waste your money unless you are a collector of useless, poorly constructed dance tights. ."
1.0,Extremely big wings
1.0,Broke in a second
1.0,They don't stick when you wrap it around your finger and don't fit to the ring either will not use them again
1.0,"The sunglasses came shipped in an envelope instead of a small box, so they were all bent. The metal is very cheap and the overall quality is very lacking."
1.0,Item returned. Absolutely too small.
1.0,6-12 months Was too big for my little one . It fit well for my 1 year old nephew so I gave it to him instead.
1.0,"cheap materia, doesn't fit even when I bought an extra large"
1.0,I ordered two. One arrived broken. It was clearly poorly crafted as it didn't seem like shipping damage.
1.0,"I purchased this based on the description ""2PCS"" believing there were two of the same necklace however this was just a single necklace. The necklace is cute but I wouldnt have purchased for the price had I known it was only one piece. Disappointed."
1.0,"Deeply regret de-tagging.... Least flattering dress I've ever owned. Seemed soft, figured it'd be comfortable but it fits weird, too high at armpits and it looks AWEFUL. Like you ever sit down, bend to pick up something or just move in a bad dress and you look terrible? Like suddenly you look pregnant or it's bunching up making it look like you have back fat rolls?? Look being human and imperfect is one thing but accentuating every flaw on your body? Yeah. $15 worth of feeling like crap about your figure. You'd think the bust line would look good but somehow this makes me look flat. It somehow diminishes any positive features. Always full mirror check before you de-tag. That was a horrible horrible experience. I'm 116lb I lost weight, my figure looks better than usual in most outfits and this made me feel like I look like I need to lose weight. Typically I feel too skinny at this weight and work to gain a couple of pounds back to be comfortable in my own body. Seriously don't even try it."
1.0,I had the hardest time getting it to fit in my watch.  It was to the point of doubting why I purchased it.
1.0,It broke the first day I put it on .
1.0,I won't use them . They say leather!!!
1.0,Was not what it looked blike in the picture!<br />It was way off on the size chart. Runs very small
1.0,One size...if your a midget.
1.0,Looked nothing like it!
1.0,Did not like the fabric. It had a discount department store look and feel
1.0,The 1st 3 that I purchased were great and came in a Hoter package. #4 that I purchased was not the same as the other 3 and came in a Veni Massee package. Very disappointed with the last one. Was going to purchase a couple more but now I'm afraid too.
1.0,"Too boxy, very large"
1.0,"This items run super small, smaller than the post leads you to believe. I even sized up like suggested. The sweater is very short the fit is super awkward. You can't really move your arms while wearing it. I ordered it in 3 colors (red, grey, black) in XL the fit across the colors wasn't consistent. The red is really small, the grey & black are small. I wouldn't recommend buying this product. I am really disappointed because I love the look of the sweater in the photos."
1.0,The material is stiff as a board and there are 2 lines of dust running each side of the back where the shirt laid for who knows how long in a dusty storage area.
1.0,"Ordered wrong size, wrong color arrived, Love the fabric, love the style,but these pants are NOT PLEATED!"
1.0,It wasn‚Äôt at all what I expected. I should have researched it more than I did when I purchased it
1.0,I probably should‚Äôve thought it was magnetize to my braces but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this sucks I can‚Äôt even use it because of this.
1.0,"In reality, the jhumka are too small and do not look good. Please DO NOT BUY"
1.0,"The ""wood grain"" is already peeling off."
1.0,I ordered Wide. These were not Wide. My toes were squished together to a point.
1.0,"Slippery, rubbery, plastic type of ...dare I use the word ""fabric"" that I could not possibly wear. The thought of literally sweating to absolute death crossed my mind, but only momentarily, as I would not dare wear this tablecloth cover in the shape of dress - in public.  Please my friends, do not spend your money on THIS misrepresented item advertised as ""clothing."".  It is more like a one of those rubber devices that you use to open a very difficult bottle of tomato sauce. Thank you for enduring my rant."
1.0,SUPER SMALL.
1.0,"See photo for condition hat arrived in! It‚Äôs curled up and looks more like a squashed pretzel than a hat. Size is quite small, it fits my teenagers and me...definitely won‚Äôt fit a man unless he has a really small head. It‚Äôs going back. Really disappointing, it looks and feels cheap... and has really nasty plastic clips to hold on the underneck strap. It‚Äôs more like a child‚Äôs dress up hat than a real cowboy hat. Only positive I can see is buffalo logo at front looks cool but it‚Äôs stuck to plastic that‚Äôs trying to look like leather"
1.0,Will turn fingers green
1.0,The seam busted out after 2 months of wear.
1.0,Keep away. So. Damn. Cheap. And so ugly and flimsy.
1.0,"This night outfit was a size large. The pants were so tight, the shirt wouldn‚Äôt even go over my head. To be honest I got the large for comfort, but this was not comfortable."
1.0,"(Sadly) revision of rating die to it breaking in under a week of use. Disappointing.<br />I got this to replace my &#34;rubber&#34; band that caused skin irritation and a rash. I love the look, the feel, and no rash! The only thing to note is the sharp stabs of pain as your arm hair is plucked one by one due to the links that wish to have smooth baby skin contact and not hairy man surface! But meh, who needs hair there right?<br />Would recommend (hey you get free...manscaping?) This product.<br />It even comes with a tool to easily remove links to correct the sizing to ensure maximum skin surface contact!"
1.0,"I tried them on him for the first time today, and the zipper just will not stay together at all. Will be returning as they are completely useless if I cannot zip ..."
1.0,"Ran incredibly large and returned it the day I received it. Im aware that it is &#34;oversized&#34; but the shirt was just overall unflattering. I'm a small-medium in shirts, 5'7&#34;, around 129 pounds, and ordered a size small. Not worth your money."
1.0,"Once again, the size is way way to big! 3-4t ordered 6-12m. To busy to return so I‚Äôll keep for 2-3 years until it fits, however I will not buy from this company again"
1.0,I would not recommend - the clasp is not secure & I lost my Fitbit after the 2nd day.
1.0,Zippers no good and the Sellers do not offer to replace it or refund it.....horrible!
1.0,Dress arrived with loose beads and a hole in the netting of the skirt.
1.0,"These shorts came half-way down my shin. I'm 5'6"".  I would need to be well over 6'6"" for the length to be a proper fit. Basketball players might find them perfect."
1.0,The skirt is not orange. The dress I received was cranberry red with evergreen accents.<br />* EDIT WHY IS THE RIGHT SIDE PATTERN LINE<br />  LOCATION ON MY gluteus maximum üò®üò®
1.0,"Someone needs to relearn their colors. You're crazy if you think these two jackets are the same color grey. It is even more of a baby blue color in person. So disappointed and my outfit colors are clashing now, do better and find your glasses. Sleeves are too short in size."
1.0,this is definitely NOT full support (at least for DD) - I sent it back - highly recommend Moving Comfort Women's Juno Sports Bra - It's spendy ($60) but well worth the price.  I have three - I run quite a bit. .
1.0,I had ordered this product before and the sizing was great. I ordered the same size as before and it is too big. Then I went back and did the sizing and it said I should wear an XL. Just do you know I am an extra small.
1.0,"Item does not look like it does in the picture. It's extremely cheap looking. The moon's stones aren't even clear, but are black. The blue center stone is not oval but round and is not screwed on to the moon as shown but dangling on a hook that looks like it's coming apart.<br /><br />I don't know if this is just a cheap knock off of other listings for the same exact necklace on Amazon or what, but THIS listing looks like a gumball machine piece in person. I will not be giving this item as a gift as I planned, but giving it to my little girl to play with. No adult should wear this."
1.0,They ripped while I was getting into my car. Only wore them 2-3 times.<br /><br />Poor quality.
1.0,"NOT TIGHTS!  These are tiny ! They would maybe fit someone who is size 0 or 2. Very thin nylons type material. There is also very little waist band, if any, I don't know how they would stay up.  Don't waste your money!"
1.0,I agree with the reviews that this too looks nothing like the pics. I feel like I'm wearing a sheet. Shapeless and not in the good floaty drapery way that these shirts are supposed to fit. The only thing that's good is the print. I would never buy this again. Waste of money.
1.0,Runs small and does not sit properly on top.
1.0,Poor fabric quality.... Piling/balling in material.<br />Checked out customers' reviews - ordered XXL - similar to M ( but too short in length).
1.0,Unable to try on. 2 sizes too smal perhaps.
1.0,The size chart is way off. I wear an XL but ordered an XXL and still could not even get it on.
1.0,Donot buy it
1.0,"I didn't actually hate the product, it is very cute. The first time my daughter wore it, it broke. Could be a fluke but wasn't impressed."
1.0,Dreadful. I wish I could travel through time to stop this order.
1.0,I did not really like these bags they ripped after a few use
1.0,I had one in. And the next thing I knew the top insert was gone. Put my second one in an hour ago and the gem fell out... DO NOT PURCHASE
1.0,The package was delivered however there was no item in the box. (Came empty).
1.0,So disappointed when I tried it on! I got a large and  my boobs where barely covered (36B) and my whole bottom half was showing in the front! I don‚Äôt feel like getting a larger size would help as the dress fit in all areas besides not enough where I needed it! Definitely did not look look the picture!
1.0,Only a tail came‚Ä¶ no ears- second time I‚Äôve ordered something and was missing stuff..
1.0,"I‚Äôve washed this jacket twice ,once inside out can‚Äôt get rid of the lint whatever you wear under it is covered completely  in lint."
1.0,Strap holder breaks almost immediately when you go to take watch off
1.0,Negative 5 stars !Ordered US large. It is not a large has no shape and very poor quality. I requested a refund and was offered a 50% refund. Do not purchase from this company
1.0,Poor quality fabric  poorly made and looked different from online picture I regret placing this order and it took a very long time to be  delivered totally disappointed
1.0,Broke shortly after I got it.
1.0,I ordered several replacement straps for the Galaxy Watch 3 and started with this one. When attaching the strap with the quick release pin it was immediately clear that the strap was too thick on the end where the stitching holds the pin. The edge of the strap sat right up against the body of the watch with no room for movement. A few minutes later I decided to try out another strap and noticed that the quick release pin was already broken! Not sure if this was just a defective product or if the other straps are better but this was certainly a waste of money. Had to cut around the pin to release it and threw the whole thing away.
1.0,"The fabric of this skirt was completely misrepresented.  There is zero stretch, and while it DID fit, it had no give whatsoever....hence, the &#34;too small&#34; description and the one star rating.  Additionally, the distressed part was completely see-through, so inappropriate for wearing to work or in public...unless you want your nethers exposed to the world."
1.0,I hate the buttons
1.0,I do not think this is worth it‚Äôs price. These feel very cheap. To me these feel more like plastic than metal. It is very thin and flimsy. These come in plastic wrapping but the lenses are already scratched. The price doesn‚Äôt reflect the quality. They don‚Äôt seem to be polarized.<br />On a positive note the tint is dark and the style is very cute.<br />I honestly would suggest a different product.
1.0,VERY see through..
1.0,Quality it‚Äôs not as show. Too small and also you need to pay shipping to return.
1.0,No response regarding return.  Size very small and not good quality.  Would not buy from this seller again
1.0,These need to come in more sizes... Preferably larger sizes!!! I want these but there's no way in hell my foot is gonna fit inside a US men's 8... These would be perfect for parkour!!!
1.0,"Really thin, nothing much between you and the floor.  Even at the price I'd not recommend"
1.0,Very ugly
1.0,ripped my first day using and were as good as sponges for keeping water out.. not very happy with this product
1.0,It fell apart after one wear.
1.0,Is not good I got it in two day stop working
1.0,Were broke the day after I received them.
1.0,Much much smaller than anticipated
1.0,"So disappointed. It was ripped, color was totally different. I ordered because of a party and was so excited and this was the only dress that I could have had which was disappointing and made me in tight situation and last minute that had no clue how to find something else. Color was navy, pale navy but in  picture is turquoise. so disappointing."
1.0,I ordered 2 of the same dresses just different colors but the exact same size.<br />The second dress (pink and blue) fit way more snug and it didn‚Äôt have pockets like the first one.  Sending the second dress back.  What happened to consistency?
1.0,"The upper materials of this sandal are very poor and the sandals stretch out after first wear and are very loose on the foot making them very uncomfortable to wear.  They stretch out so much that you can walk right out of them.  Very cute, bad materials."
1.0,1 of the earrings came broken
1.0,"The fasteners are so poorly made and will slide out with the smallest amount of pressure, no matter how you fasten them. Do not buy these, spend the money for something better."
1.0,"Not only was it not true to size (super small) the quality is terribly made. My son wears size 18 months, but I got him a 2T. Super super tight. The printed design seemed more like painted on. So the material couldn‚Äôt stretch with out looking like it was ruining the print. Also the stitching seemed like it was made in a sweatshop. Uneven and not appealing. Just very poorly made and very uncomfortable."
1.0,"I got the thing on but, as soon as I started walking, my fun bags were apparently too heavy and it all came unpeeled. (I got the DD, even though I'm a DDD. But... ya know... they don't make them that large). It was pretty disappointing."
1.0,Very cheap and nothing like the pictures
1.0,This is not very good quality T Shirt. I wouldnt recommend.
1.0,"Would have been attractive if it had both horns attached.  Headband fit nicely, and wasn‚Äôt too heavy. Horns do not appear to be well attached to headband."
1.0,"Hello my first review was refused because I didn‚Äôt describe my likes and dislikes. It‚Äôs not white but off white, runs small, not good quality , see thru, super long as in when ticked in its not nice look as in the picture.<br /><br />*I received a ribbed tank to not the above top but they wouldn‚Äôt post my review amount getting the wrong item."
1.0,Not like the picture at all. Thin skin right stretchy material. Not in the slightest flowy. The issue is that the picture is false and misrepresented the product completely. A sweater for ants.
1.0,"First off, the pin was stuck to its packaging because the enamel wasn't fully cured. The whole thing is also just very messy, there are bubbles in it, big splotches of black all over the other colors, and there's even a piece of paper towel(??) stuck to part of it. The enamel is still sticky. This was a waste of money. Don't buy this product."
1.0,"LOW QUALITY. Followed washing instructions and shirt shrunk drastically, completely ruining the shape of the shirt. Material is rough; not soft. Color was nice."
1.0,Ordered a 14 fixed small too small but very pretty dress.
1.0,Lasted a week when I actually started using it.
1.0,Very poor quality broke after wearing for five minutes and seller was not willing to help
1.0,Must order up by 1 size. I‚Äôm a large in every top but this large was like a Md. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
1.0,"I liked how fast they shipped but am not happy with the material or the fit. Not well sewn either as the belt loop became unsewn on first wear.<br /><br />I expect a paperbag type effect at the waist. The belt loops are so high up on this short, once the belt is threaded thru the loops, you loose the gathered effect.<br /><br />I got the freelance ones before these and will try those again. I was happier with the fit and material. And definitely they are better made."
1.0,"This is an update to my previous review. I gave this product a less than stellar review because a flap in front did not stay down (I returned the product). The seller asked if I would reconsider the review because he was working on a redesign and if I amended the review he would send me the new design (presumedly for free). That never happened. So if this article is still available, I can't recommend it or the seller.<br /><br />This is a nice pair of underwear except the flap doesn't stay down and thus your junk is totally exposed. Some type of fastener would solve the problems. I gave this feedback to the company owner and he was responsive. This is the new product: [[ASIN:B017B67QS4 Sexy Underwear Men's Briefs Boxer Shorts Bulge Pouch Soft Underpants Sex Love Game #5]]"
1.0,I did not receive the right ring.  I received the USN ring that was due between 9 and 14 Nov.
1.0,"Listing states women‚Äôs sizes however I got the largest size for my daughter (she needed them for a communal bathroom at college) and they wouldn‚Äôt have fit her feet at age 5 they are so small. We are all adults in this house therefore total waste of money since they are unusable. Quality was also very poor-cheap plastic & since the plastic is so cheap, they don‚Äôt even sit flat, so even if the size fit, they‚Äôd be very uncomfortable to wear. Disappointed."
1.0,We were looking for luggage that was easy to maneuver through and from the airport. We also like  that the luggage is expandable.
1.0,I like this but need sweatshirt
1.0,This purse in so cheap looking and poorly made. The material isn't faux suede at all it's like velvet. I hate it and I'm sending it back. Don't waste your money it's nothing like the picture.
1.0,"Have to order 2 sizes up for it to potentially fit..and it‚Äôs super short and boxy. Very disappointed, i wanted this so badly to work."
1.0,It‚Äôs is way to low on the sides you have to wear a shirt under it
1.0,"The sleeves are too short, and the sweater is just all around floppy. It isn't flattering at all."
1.0,"It is coming apart and pilling really bad, it as only been washed 4 times. Do not buy this!!"
1.0,Size not close/ returning
1.0,Way to small. Order what should have fit my feet.
1.0,Only if you have little feet will these work
1.0,If I could give it a 0 I would. Cheap looking. Tried to return it but I was a day late and window closed. It would be nice to be refunded at least.
1.0,Off center and broken zipper
1.0,It was very uncomfortable. The shaft has plastic that sticks out and almost cut my tongue
1.0,Will never buy from this kind of dress. Such a bad experience and feeling shame for sending a low quality item. Product received defective. Whole lace in near the under arm was tear off.<br />Such a bad experience.
1.0,This is not as described and I am returning.
1.0,The color was not as pictured and the bottoms were too small.
1.0,Three of the key holders where broken
1.0,Not as tight and firm as the others I bought earlier.
1.0,Not as described i was expecting an actual shoulder back that would fit my laptop and pens... the bag is a shoulder bag. But its not roomie like is started.. the so called zipper to open up doesn‚Äôt expand like is stated. The bag doesn‚Äôt even get an inch bigger.. highly disappointed
1.0,"So sad.  I ordered 2 for my matching suitcases and the 2 times I've used it, it just kept loosening up and slipping off.  What a waste of money.  I've given up on it.  I am writing it off now as garbage :("
1.0,Horrible!  The number was seen on crooked and the name on the back of the jersey was seen on upside down!!!!
1.0,"Within a month, the underside of the ring tarnished and turned a light copper color"
1.0,After you wash the sweatshirt the fabric isn't soft anymore.
1.0,I bought 2 size up n it still didn‚Äôt fit.
1.0,Runs very very small! A 4x looks more like a large
1.0,"The dress was a beautiful color, but one pocket is about &#34;4 above the other so there's a weird pocket lump high on one side and low on the other.  It was really wrinkled when it arrived so I washed in cold and let line dry according to instructions. That worked great to get out the wrinkles.  I wish I had noticed the pockets being sewn so far off before washing it though so I could return it. Otherwise it would have been a really cute dress."
1.0,it wasn't as i expected at all
1.0,I am 5' 9&#34; and it was too short for me
1.0,Poorly made had holes in seams right out of the package. Returned them and the second pair had the sam problem in a different spot.
1.0,Great if you like things ticking nearby.
1.0,leg opening is scratchy and for 10.00 a pair I thought they would be soft
1.0,"I ordered this bag on July 2017, and of course the company closed the return window? on August 2017. It is not even a year old, and the main zipper on top has ripped from the side of the bag.  I did not put groceries in the bag. I also did not use the bag constantly.  I am so disappointed in this happening.  When you purchase an item that you really love, and something like this happens, you almost have to wish the bag falls apart before a month.<br />A really beautiful bag but do not fall in love with it!"
1.0,IT HAD A WHITE (SPILL) STAIN ON THE FRONT AND IT SMELLED LIKE SOMEONE SPILLED A BOTTLE OF ESSENCE ON IT (WITH A BIG BLACK STAIN SHOWING ON Y<br />THE SIDE). SEEMED USED TO ME. GLAD I GOT MY MOMEY BACK.
1.0,This looks ridiculous! I tried it on when I got it on my birthday. Was going to wear it out that night and I was very disappointed with this romper.
1.0,They sound great but really don‚Äôt work at all.
1.0,I cannot believe these stopped working in 1 day .. these are a rip off
1.0,It's not what I spect the saler said they are adjustable but it's not for all the vision well not for the mine sorry
1.0,"It was beutiful, , unfortunately it arrived with a stone missing.The stone wasn't even in bag.That was reason enough not to get a replacement."
1.0,"Can't even unclip it, so it is useless"
1.0,Very cheap but I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,Pin losen up on first day and I lost the watch
1.0,"Extremely poor quality, and fit nothing like in the picture."
1.0,Horrible product! Got my size and only goes to my knees. I have an hourglass frame so definitely not meant for someone with curves.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:3ac7f970edb56087fcf8105fd19d596e]] Imagine ordering a jacket for your husky husband that is supposed to resemble RIP‚Äôs jacket and getting a child‚Äôs size XL that isn‚Äôt at all what the picture depicts! It is barely belly button length which isn‚Äôt what men are wearing, at least not my man! The picture shows a longer jacket with adjustable buttons in the back. Watch the video üòÇalso, they don‚Äôt send you the ‚Äúfree‚Äù keychain"
1.0,"These are super cute but unfortunately one of them has a defective clasp and can‚Äôt close at all, so not very good construction."
1.0,Horrible quality. It looks like the mesh material was cut by a 5 year old. It is jagged and uneven. Glad it was cheap because it was a complete waste of money. Went straight into the garbage on Christmas morning.
1.0,Looks nothing like pic. Sewn bad.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:692a66044626b32bcc91931f21264d8c]]
1.0,It looks good. However the moment to close  the bracket never worked smoothy. And in about one week it stopped working altogether and broke. The string snapped. The rough working of the string movement might be because the band is rubber. It is not leather. Because of this the string might not move smoothly. Can not return or exchange this because it is not in the same condition in which it arrived.  I recommend not buying this bracket. There are better ones out there.  I was forced to give the minimum of one star in order to post this reveiw.
1.0,Very poor -- the design is encased in clear plastic and began chipping off around the edges immediately. It may not last a month before needing to be replaced.
1.0,Really disappointed about this
1.0,Didn‚Äôt know how to work.  Useless to me
1.0,Face on watch cracked! Shipped together in one bag with paint materials!!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f426c51b945b4a2ebff8d9a8a3f9d349]] DONT BUY FOR PROM LADIES. BEWARE!!!<br />Not a good seller. USED dress.<br />The pros: Pretty color. Size good. Managable quality for price<br /> BUT the seller sent  a stained dress in a paper bag package. Clearly worn or tried on and dirtied. Really wrinkled too. Will be returning. Waste of time. No honor or pride in their shipments.
1.0,"The hat was awesome but the shield was not the best.  It was very difficult to look there.  More like looking into a ""funny mirror at the circus"".  I wish the shield was better cause I did like the hat and it would have been prefect!"
1.0,Broke in the matter of weeks and chain turned colors.
1.0,"I was disappointed in this purchase. It is very thin fabric & seems low quality. I do like the colors, but I bought this to keep me warm in heavily air conditioned places & it just doesn‚Äôt work."
1.0,Disappointed with product.  I wish I never purchased it.
1.0,"This watchband has plastic buckles, is cheaply made, and is so short it wouldn't fit a kids wrist."
1.0,Very Poorly made. The sole separated from the slipper after 3 weeks of minimal use.
1.0,"save your money ,it's a cheap hat with a sticker on it !"
1.0,"The soles on these felt like inflexible plastic. For the price, I should have known the quality would not be good."
1.0,0 stars did not light up
1.0,Bad quality. The shoe laces are already broken.
1.0,Sizing isn't right
1.0,BROKE 1 Day after return window closed. I am not hard on my glasses but this broke way too easily. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I've worn this necklace for a few months on and off and all of the crystals have fallen out. I'm delicate with my jewelry and this did not hold up, love the meaning behind it, don't love the product. Really wish it help up with use."
1.0,"It's too big and wide, even for a small. And they don't carry anything smaller. I have return."
1.0,I was very disappointed this came as one who sells one earring
1.0,The tongue was very bulky!I returned them.
1.0,Cheap not cut well
1.0,"They fit like a regular fitting t-shirt, those are not at all like in the picture. Maybe they would like like that if I sized up like 3 sizes"
1.0,Mine was broken. The mirror was shattered and the makeup its self was all over the place. I found glass in it. And all over the box it came in was covered in pink eyeshadow
1.0,"This shirt is so small for an Xl. Not true to size at all. If you have short arms, or are wide and short by all means this is the shirt for you. Otherwise don‚Äôt bother ordering unless you are the penguin from Batman"
1.0,looked smaller in the picture and needs to be listed as a Man's wristband
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt stay
1.0,I ordered a 3x large brown cardigan and got a large black one instead.  I could not use the one I got.
1.0,"This is the cheapest looking thing let me tell you. It's already tarnished and the heart isn't even attached!!!! Don't waste your money people, honest review.looks like something you get out of bubble gum machine!!!"
1.0,Garbage. Cheap  material..nothing like the picture.
1.0,Have this as a gift to a friend visiting for Easter. It broke right in the middle of our celebrations. Very cheaply made! Would not recommend at all.
1.0,This is the 5th shirt that I bought from this company that is not sized right. I can shop anywhere else and order my size and it fits
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap and not what it seems to be in the pic.
1.0,"It looks cute, but it faded will quickly and  I wore it twice and it popped."
1.0,They are very pretty an I order a lot of stuff from amazon I wish I can give this back cause it didn‚Äôt fit my watch correctly an it takes about a least 20-30 mins to put on never order again very disappointed
1.0,"Shirt is very disappointing way way to long looks like dress, beware do not buy!! My son needs a medium and always wears a large looks ridiculous waste of money."
1.0,"The design is exotic, different, price was right but the clasp does not open. There was no point to return this cost wise."
1.0,Swung it around ONCE and the strap ripped right off along with the side pocket. Yikes!! Be delicate of you decide on this.
1.0,No it didn't meet my expectations. It's to small and the fabric it's kind hard. I like to return it.
1.0,"I'm a 36 C and I purchased a Large. The bralette  fits great and there's even some room, however when I put it on, the straps broke on the entire right side. Super poor quality! Really disappointed with the price compared to quality"
1.0,Beyond too small
1.0,It broke the first day I opened
1.0,The blouse that I received is not the one that‚Äôs in the picture
1.0,Very thin material. In person I thought the dress looked more like pajamas.
1.0,"Son de material muy fragil y rapido de da√±ar, despues de un tiempo de uso, con el contacto continuo se vuelven negrizos. üëéüëé"
1.0,Trash. Totally costume jewelry which wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad but the bar to go in your earring hole is too big for that OR to fit in the mating piece and stay closed. Worthless. Couldn‚Äôt wear and mistakenly bought 2 pair!
1.0,"See above. The glasses were not good, the Amazon experience was worse."
1.0,"Ok, this is the issue, while there is quite decent arch support, the sandal is so squishy that you cannot keep your balance from side to side without a great deal of focus!  Dangerous!  In addition: the sandal does not stay on your foot!  Forget about walking around in it outdoors let alone in the house!  This is a dangerous sandal to wear for even dry weather use..I tried off and on for 1 day, now I'm back to wearing croc sandals-- they have less arch support, but they do not slip off my feet nor do I struggle for balance in the crocs.  Bummer!"
1.0,it broke immediately upon trying to attach.....I'm sending them back....
1.0,These shoes are extremely uncomfortable and the green finish tore off of the shoe in one big chunk and I hadn't even worn them yet.
1.0,Looks amazing. Seams poorly put together. Mesh rips at zipper seams
1.0,"This dress was literally a piece of material, a single piece of material.  No lining, no nothing.  It is completely see through.  The photo I've attached shows a square (which is a window), with a truck parked outside.  The picture may not have captured it well, but you can actually see the truck through the dress.  I'm not sure how other purchasers thought this was a good quality about the dress.  Cute print but seriously disappointed in the fabric (or lack thereof).  Received this in the mail today and it is already packaged back up to be returned."
1.0,Had to return. Super tight on the arms and flattened my chest a lot. Looked totally wrong and was longer than expected. Not made properly at all.
1.0,Need return  cannot adjust watch band instructions not clear.<br /><br />Will Order cuff watch
1.0,Its too bad I had to throw these away! Nice look but too big!!!
1.0,I order the wrong size. By mistake üòüwould like to exchange
1.0,"I think after seeing the good reviews on this, I must have gotten a dress that wasn't cut correctly. If it had fit right it could have been really cute, but the front part over the chest was cut in such a narrow triangle that it didn't cover at all. It was like wearing a bathing suit backwards. :) This was for a dance recital and a few of the girls had this same problem."
1.0,I ordered this dress in gray. It arrived in khaki. Also the medium ran very small and the seams weren‚Äôt straight. Returned it.
1.0,"Ordered these in the black and blue tie dye......nicely made, nice fit.... BUT WHEN WASHED THE WATER IS PITCH BLACK AND NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU WASH THEM IT DOES NOT STOP....STAINED MY SHEETS ..and the blue ones the same thing, washed seperately 6 times and still colored water....Don‚Äôt buy."
1.0,Material very thin. Was expecting t shirt material.<br />Will not order any more for they were made in China had no ideal. Cheap and too expensive I got 2 I did not finish the order for
1.0,Immediately after opening the dress I knew it was not gonna be good. The material felt super cheap and looked sloppy. I initially couldnt tell the top from the bottom. The dress is a tacky mess.
1.0,"I learned an important lesson with this order. I ordered the dress which I kind of like, but the fit was not flattering and the pockets were way too low. I would ordinarily return an order like this and try a different dress. but not this order, the return process was non-standard.

1.0,A large is about the size of a regular persons small.
1.0,I ordered this EXACT same product a year ago for my daith piercing and LOVED it. Decided to order matching ones for my ears. WTF? I paid the EXACT SAME amount of money for 1/2 the earring! In the photo the one on my right is the one I have already had and the one on the left showed up today. You had better believe I am in the returns process.
1.0,Runs small in hips with no stretch
1.0,Worst junk material was very cheap I order 2 and both broke on the strap one day if arriving. Junk junk
1.0,"This is a dress , not a shirt . Returned it ."
1.0,Very nice right size but most of them didn't have the studs in them
1.0,Terrible. Broke when putting it in the slot.
1.0,This looks so bad it‚Äôs almost funny. Looks nothing like the picture. It fits more like a shirt. Very cheap material. ‚ÄòLace Chiffon‚Äô is definitely a stretch. Returned it.
1.0,"UPDATE: Company contacted me and said they would replace it.  However,  the replacement was now coming from overseas and would take longer to arrive.  It has now been over 5 weeks and I still have not received it.<br />****I bought this bracelet a couple of months ago for my daughter and put it away for a Christmas gift.  She just sent me the pictures today, after wearing it for the first time.  The ""strings"" are all frayed.  I am very disappointed.  Based on the description, it appears like it should have been a ""Good tensile stretchable elastic thread, will not break easily"".  I am beyond disappointed in the quality of this piece and especially since it was a gift."
1.0,My son loves this hat!! But he's only wore it a handful of times and it's already falling apart.... I'm super disappointed.
1.0,These look nothing like what I ordered I‚Äôm not happy!!
1.0,"Arrived broken - one of the snaps on the strap was broken when I got it. It‚Äôs too bad, because it‚Äôs pretty nice otherwise."
1.0,I bought the biggest size possible (40) after reading they run small. They are ridiculously small! Can‚Äôt even wear them. Going to give them to a skinny 13 year old. Buyer beware!! As i normally wear womens size 10
1.0,See through!! I wanted to love it but you could see everything
1.0,It is extremely ill fitting.  Not so much small as ill fitting.  I strongly dislike it.
1.0,This shirt dress is short and very thin! Not a thick material as the picture appears.
1.0,It unraveled after one wash
1.0,"When I receive it, it had a bad oder and stained. And the size was much smaller."
1.0,"I returned this item. After biking 8 miles in the rain (two days in a row) I can say with 100% certainty that the product is NOT waterproof. The covers have a very tight fit, which I thought would seal water out, but I tried two different shoes and arrived completely soaked both days. Do not buy this product if you want something that is waterproof."
1.0,Looks like a bath rug.
1.0,"I love the top , I ordered a Large , which is what I wear, but this fits more like a small , needless to say , I was disappointed"
1.0,Ordered a 2xl or what would fit a 40/42 waist and resize a medium with a 2xl tag. Runs super small. Feels cheap
1.0,BRACLET BROKE AS I WAS TRYING TO PUT IT ON FOR THE FIRST TIME.AND NECLESE SO SHORT THAT ALMOST CHOKING MY NECK.BIG BIG DISAPOINTMENT.CAN'T WAIT FOR LABELS TO SEND THIS ALL BACK.
1.0,First time I wore was today and I noticed there was a hole in the hem that spread throughout the course of the day. My return window has closed....
1.0,"In less than 3 months of light use, the plastic arm broke away from the eyepiece. They haven‚Äôt been dropped, twisted, etc. Even Wally World‚Äôs $10 glasses don‚Äôt do this badly."
1.0,"Review immediately: I have used only one pair so far, but its comfortable and does the job, and is a complete no show sock.<br /><br />Review 50 Days Later: Have used all 6 pairs and washed once or twice, they get so small, its almost like its baby sized, it does stretch back to your feet. I wear a size 8.5. But major flaw is they slip of your feet while your walking inside the shoe. Its so annoying and you have to remove your shoe and pull them back up and put shoe back on."
1.0,"Olvide hacer el review antes, pero fue una compra de poner en la basura, muy pequena, como para una nina de 7 anos. La calidad pesima!, fue un gasto absurdo de dinero."
1.0,Exactly as the headline says. They broke after the second use.
1.0,"Didn't work for me. Too thick,  left an outline all around the pad. Im a C cup and I got the larger size."
1.0,"GARBAGE THIS THING LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE IMAGE FOR SALE.  ""BUYER BEWARE"""
1.0,"This item appears great in the ad.  Unfortunately, it does not wear well.  The insoles came out after the first week and have now started to fray around the edges after less than a month of use.  I would have returned them, but my husband decided to keep them with the knowledge they wouldn't last very long."
1.0,"After reading the reviews I am so disappointed. While the umbrella itself is very nice, there is a small 'slider' that holds it up and ours arrived already stretched out so I'm not sure how long the entire contraption will even work.<br />The base is awful. It's a very thin metal that has already bent and there is no way it is going to withstand Oklahoma wind without falling over. I would highly recommend looking elsewhere instead of getting this umbrella. For the price you pay, it should not be this cheaply made. If you do order it, buy a sand base to save the thin little legs from breaking off. It's really so huge that it would be almost impossible to ship back.<br />I would not suggest that anyone buy this. It's a waste of a lot of money."
1.0,"As previous reviewer said, this is a very cheap hoodie. The iron on was sloppy and blurry, as well as two different types of blue printed on the front and back. Logo cracking and I just took it out of the package. This will absolutely not hold up in a washing machine and probably not even a day of wear. You‚Äôre better off going to a mall kiosk and having them screen print an item in front of you."
1.0,"I purchased two of these tank tops. The ""orange"" one is not orange and looks nothing like the photo...it is a dark rust color. Both of the tops had a raw, unsewn hem that started to unravel within minutes of putting the top on and both were extremely short in length, more like a cropped top. These are very poor quality. I am returning both tops. The fit also runs very small, more like Asian sizing probably."
1.0,"These sunglasses were even cuter than the picture and looked great on, however, sad to say the right temple piece broke off the 2nd day I wore them!"
1.0,Low quality n does not match picture
1.0,These lenses do not fit Oakley Sliver style glasses....
1.0,Missing stones and poor quality (stones are cricked). Not as advertised. Don't waste your money!
1.0,This are not stainless steel they turn colors and give a bad smell on the ear won‚Äôt purchase again
1.0,"The tie received is a 3.5"" tie, not 3"" as described."
1.0,Love the print pattern But the shirt had a bad tare in it. Can't be worn.
1.0,"Bought these for my wife she wears medium but I thought perhaps a large would be safe, Nop! They did not fit over her foot much less up her legs. So large was not a good choice. The sell will not except returns, so role the dice and hope you get something that fits."
1.0,"I ordered these for the cold times here and they are at least 3 sizes smaller than what I ordered. Luckily they fit my daughter but I‚Äôm upset that they didn‚Äôt fit me, whom they were bought for."
1.0,"It's square. I bought a medium and I've average in size. It's as wide as it is long, which is not typical. It's extremely unflattering and comes up short so it sits at high on the hip - even more unflattering. It's like a more cropped crop top and makes me look significantly heavier than I am."
1.0,The necklace now is turning different colors it does not stand up to the test of time
1.0,Did not come with strap
1.0,Small shirt
1.0,This was the worst purchase I‚Äôve ever made.  Item came to me used!!!!  I went on a cruise and this dress literally smelled up my entire room!!!  We had to throw it away.  So disappointed.
1.0,It fits like a sack.  The dress is sown straight un and down.  It looks like a box.  The size XL is what I wear and it fits like an XL but is just weird.  I washed it and the treads on the straps frayed already.  It makes no sense to send such an inexpensive garment back so I'll garden in it.
1.0,LONG TAILS like a regular dress shirt. guess I am gonna have to save and buy the real deal even though those are way too expensive
1.0,"Weird material. Uncomfortable, kind of like a rain jacket. Heavy dress."
1.0,Item was to small. Crotch ripped out within 2 minutes of wearing.
1.0,I only got half the colors that are pictured! I want all the colors sent to me!
1.0,This is not authentic shungite. These are some knock off dyed beads. I have had them about a month and had intuition  they were not authentic. I never felt any energies from them. I noticed after a month this black powder all over my hands (like charcoal). Upon further inspection I noticed it was coming off the bracelet. You can see the stretchy band has clear parts and dyed parts. Note the residue on my fingers. Note on multiple beads where all the dye has worn off.<br />I‚Äôm sick of dishonest people selling knock offs.  KARMA!
1.0,Company was awesome they let me return them but these gloves looked like they belonged at a construction site
1.0,Zipper broker after two washes
1.0,Sucks. Does not cool worth a damn.
1.0,"Bought this mask last minute for Halloween, it didn‚Äôt light up and isn‚Äôt returnable so my son was disappointed to just wear it without lights."
1.0,really thin cheap material. I would not have spent money on this if I knew
1.0,"doesn't look or fit like the picture, do not buy"
1.0,Mal servicio llego nuevamente con el. Mismo desperfecto y ahora peor sin bater√≠a
1.0,"First of all, the ‚Äúmint green‚Äù came in a pastel blue, not any shade of mint or green in any way shape or form. Secondly, I was well aware of the cheeky-ness/thong when I purchased, but the front of the suit is sooooo low I‚Äôd never feel comfortable wearing in public. It‚Äôs not a size issue, it fits, but isn‚Äôt able to go over your hips like the picture shows which is the style I was looking for. The top is okay, but the padding inside makes a bulky weird wrinkly look and the inside white lining is exposed. The quality isn‚Äôt very good either. I‚Äôd take a picture but I‚Äôve already thrown it in the trash because it‚Äôs not even worth going through the hassle to return for $11. To me, (5‚Äù8 and 130 pounds), there‚Äôs no sizing up or down to make this work, and I wish I was as fortunate as the reviews I read where it worked out. Maybe it‚Äôs a body type maybe it‚Äôs unrealistic expectations but it wasn‚Äôt worth it."
1.0,"Nice enough looking shirt made from a very light cloth.  The 2xl size I purchased felt more like a large, as I still have xlarge shirts to compare with."
1.0,Fits bad
1.0,"No me gust√≥, el anillo estaba manchado."
1.0,See threw cheap
1.0,not durable and overall poor quality
1.0,"It‚Äôs beautiful.... but it‚Äôs like wearing sandpaper. It scratches anything it touches including fingers, other rings, clothes, etc..."
1.0,Lenses are already ruined. They are supposed to be polarized but the lenses are separating. Very disappointed as I can't return.
1.0,"Ordered this in next size up, still too small. Shirt come with no tags, inside out and unbuttoned-looks like maybe a previous return. All other clothing I got in this particular purchase has tags."
1.0,Nose peice was on the bottom of mask.
1.0,"I love the fit and colors but I put the sweater on and didn't touch anything that should snag a sweater and by the end of a couple hours or wearing, there were snags all over it. Brushing my hand on it even snagged it. Sent it back, won't order another one."
1.0,Was so small I dropped on the carpet and couldn't find them should have said what size they were
1.0,"This sweater is itchy, so I returned it."
1.0,There very nice but break easilyI
1.0,The entire necklace was broken when I recieved it. Very DISAPPOINTING!!! There was only one medal and all three chains were broken. Spend more money and get somethin worth having. NOT THIS!!!!!
1.0,"These run extremely small.  I ordered my sons normal size and 1 size up, and both were too small.  I'd say you'll probably have to go 2 sizes up"
1.0,"I wore them once and the screw broke and fell out, out of nowhere."
1.0,"This was a Big disappointment for me. Firstly I had to wait quite a while to get it delivered. And then when I got it I couldn't believe the Very Little Arch Support, right out of the box! And will probably get worse as the cushioning gets compacted after wearing a while. It came with 2 Super Thin little pads to put under the main foot insert. SO disappointed. I put it right back in the box. I DID go ahead and order a bunch of other foot inserts which I'll try in it, to Try to make these useful. I have plantar fasciitis and these slippers as-is actually hurt the balls of my feet. Besides the minimal arch support there is no metatarsal pad, and in fact seemingly little padding at all at the ball of the foot. NOT suitable for plantar fasciitis if you have pain in the balls of the foot (just below the toes). If I were you I'd try a different slipper if you're looking for relief of plantar fasciitis."
1.0,This is not sterling silver. My neck returned green!
1.0,This product is not even close to the Chinese sizing listed! The measurements are just really wonky. These are very thin pants with a tencl feel and not a denim jean. They truly do not look as pictured.
1.0,"I was so excited about getting this wallet and was sadly disappointed.  When I put all my card in the wallet it would not stay closed.  I staggered the cards so that they offset each other from both sides, but with no success.  The concept was nice, however the reality did not work.  There's no point in having that many card slots if you can't use them."
1.0,"They don‚Äôt light up. I was so excited to give these to my daughter, but they don‚Äôt light up at all. Such a scam."
1.0,This is just a piece of cardboard with designs on it...I was very disappointed with the product..
1.0,i really liked the color of this stone which is why I purchased the ring. It's HUGE! I got the ring in a size 6 which is a little bigger than what I normally wear (my size is a 5.5). The ring looked atrocious on my small fingers. It's not worth sending back since it was cheap to begin with.
1.0,Arrived broken in half. Super cheap quality - the top part is only attached to the base with a couple staples.
1.0,I am normally  wear a women‚Äôs size large.  I ordered an XL just in case. I received what looks like an extra small. Can‚Äôt  eating return it now  for some reason. Not happy about this. This is in Asian sizing so runs very small FYI.
1.0,Some of the writing was way too small to read. At first I thought it was misprinted and then I squint my eyes.
1.0,Mal producto cambiaron de color en poco tiempo
1.0,cheap product; this was made for a child not an adult!
1.0,Hat was a bit too tight and the light never indicated it was charging or charged when plugged in.  It never powered on or played any audio.
1.0,"They tarnished within a couple weeks of wearing. Had to throw them all away and purchase better quality, should‚Äôve done that from the beginning."
1.0,Half of the flowers fell off the head band before it arrived. Very cheap looking & cheaply made.. I should have listened to the other reviews.
1.0,Broke the first time ibwemt to put it on and not returnable??
1.0,The item was a joke I tried to return the item and would have lost more money then if I kept it.  The laces  were to big for a child's shoe and to small for an adult's shoes.  Why do we ave to pay to have the items returned?
1.0,Not what I was expecting. HATE IT!!
1.0,"Looks very cute, but one of the seams was undone. The fabric does not seem like it will wash well; it feels like it will shrink. Also runs very short in the front; I am only 5'5&#34; and it is too short to wear with mid-rise jeans."
1.0,Way too small. The print is blurry and it‚Äôs so thin for a hoodie. Also came with a hole in it. If my mom hadn‚Äôt thrown away the packaging with the return label I would‚Äôve returned it.
1.0,These are horrible quality! Underwear has more material than these pants. Paper towel is thicker than these pants. I will be returning.
1.0,"Size too small even though I ordered a bigger size. Very thin material. And since it came from Asia, took over a month to receive."
1.0,They fit tight
1.0,Fabric is not durable and broke through after first use. Very cheaply made. Not worth the money.
1.0,I did not like the fit nor the fabric
1.0,"Sizing was completely off, I would need to go a few sizes up, despite what the sizing chart recommended"
1.0,"The dress runs a little small and it was way too tight on me. Tight in the arms, tight in the chest, tight evrerywhere. I will be returning this dress. Maybe I'll try ordering a larger size in the future. I was sad because I was really looking forward to wearing it for a baptism, but it was too late to order another and I ended up having to buy another beige dress elsewhere."
1.0,I bought these specifically for the red rings and got plan silver very disappointed i didn't get what I needed. I will have to buy another.
1.0,The dirst 2 weeks the wheels broke so the wouldnt come out of the shoe. She still loves them. Its been 6 months or so and the lights stoped working too.
1.0,Tarnished in 1 day. Turned nose green. Yuck!
1.0,"I wore it for one day, got home, and the bow fell off. It's not worth the money and I was super hyped up to get this belt. I'm going to attempt to glue it back on with fabric glue."
1.0,Shoe where to big asked for size 12 months bit seem like for a 24 month size
1.0,I liked the color.  I disliked the fit and material.
1.0,I thought the quality was poor and they were very small you had a hard time seeing what they were. They don't look like the picture. I wouldn't recommend buying them.
1.0,Way too big for a daith!!!! Cheapest jewlery I have ever gotten. Half of them are super hard to get open meaning once u get one in your ear it's almost impossible to close! Was really excited for them but they suck!
1.0,I never got a chance to wear them. They were so small I couldn‚Äôt even put them on. For the price I expected them to fit. I returned them.
1.0,The dress doesn‚Äôt fit as seen in the photo.
1.0,"Sent the first pair back because the touch screen fingertips didn‚Äôt work. Got a second pair, the touchscreen fingertips didn‚Äôt wok. Gave up. Asked for a refund"
1.0,"√âste producto no me gust√≥, tejido de mala calidad,mal confeccionado y con defectos en las costuras"
1.0,Why do you have to make the dresses to show almost all your boobs there‚Äôs no reason we need to have those hanging out everywhere.
1.0,This looks great at first sight but is of poor quality.
1.0,It was really cute but very cheap and i expected it to be a little stronger but it wasn‚Äôt held together very well and it broke within ten minutes of opening it.
1.0,"I ordered an XL in the pink color and the shirt was baby pink (no where close to the color shown) and I gave it to my mother who wears a small and it fit her perfect, buyers beware! I was excited to get this shirt and very let down!"
1.0,"The Amazon photo was so pretty, but the actual product is so bad! Looks like a glue blob where something fell off, so I'm gonna do exactly that...cover it up. At least it wasn't expensive. Sheesh!"
1.0,Very cheaply made broken when arrived sent it back
1.0,"having the filter is a great idea but , the filter pocket should be made with a flip to keep the filter from falling out of the pocket .<br />A couple of more stitches"
1.0,"This suit is so cheap and ill-fitting.  The print on the top looked faded and didn't match the green bottoms.  I think if you are completely flat-chested, it might be okay.  But, if you have any amount of boobage, trying to get the suit to give a little support while lined up so the cutout hits in the right space is pretty much impossible.  Definitely returning!"
1.0,"I never write reviews. Imagine how awful these shirts are for it to be my first and hopefully only. See through material on both, so uncomfortable. Don‚Äôt buy if you want warmth and comfort. Returning as soon as post opens"
1.0,These are huge. They look more like Bell Bottoms than spats! Cheap vinyl.
1.0,"Cheaply made, should be less than $5."
1.0,I bought this to wear to a wedding however it arrived too late. I opened the box and it looked beautiful. Fast forward 2 months later I remembered I ordered this and needed it to pair it with a different outfit. When I opened the box it wasn‚Äôt gold anymore. The earrings turned a brass looking color and was chipping away
1.0,I bought one in white in large and it fit perfectly.  So then I ordered this one in black in large and it is huge.  On the front it says LGG - and the other one said LG so I know it is not what I ordered.  What's going on?  I would like some answers.
1.0,This item ALWAYS breaks. I bought it 3 times and it always breaks within the first few wears. My others of similiar quality last atleast a yesr.
1.0,"The last (shoeform) that these are designed to fit must be some kind of shrunken-down adult one instead of an actual children‚Äôs one because the shape is completely wrong for kids.  It‚Äôs basically a slab of rubber tread with a thin layer of fabric over it and more fabric attached over the whole thing to form the upper - which is pulled entirely too tight to be comfortable if kid-shaped feet.  Kids have that slightly bunched-up shape to their feet which you can see will eventually lengthen into an adult foot-shape.  These are long and have a very low rise in the mid-foot.  Not appropriate for kids at all.  The material is also much thinner than expected and it makes me wonder if there was some kind of doctoring of the photos, or if those photos are even of the same product."
1.0,"Arrived with broken pieces . It was obviuosly damaged before it was shipped.  why not just tell me sorry it‚Äôs damaged üò°, we can‚Äôt fulfill your request."
1.0,Arrived with cracked lens right around where the screw is on the backside of the lens.  The little dots from where the nose piece is connect that are on the front of the lens get in the way of view.
1.0,Broke as soon as i touched them. Very cheaply made. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,"If you have strong lower body, legs and buttocks, these will not fit right. Size is not accurate."
1.0,Don't waste your money. The fabric is cheap as hell. I burned it.
1.0,I wear an XL and this fit more like a Med or Small
1.0,This hair band does not stay in place. I wore it for hour and had to keep fixing it in place.
1.0,"Not worth the money.  I should have read the full description.  It was not clear.  You only receive 3 pairs for $10.99.  If it was 6 pairs, I would be satisfied."
1.0,I bought the dark brown belt and the dark stain has rubbed off quickly wherever the belt goes through the belt loops on my jeans.  I've had the belt about 3 months and wore it daily for the first three weeks while on vacation so it got a lot of wear at first but about twice a week since then.  Quality otherwise is good and the leather itself seems durable but there's just a lot of the lighter color of the leather showing where the dark stain has rubbed off.  Almost like the dark stain didn't penetrate very deeply into the leather but only on the surface of the original lighter leather.
1.0,Product looks nothing like the picture.  The colors were much duller and the material was more like a cheap polyester.  I had to wait forever for the product and ended up returning it. Big disappointment.
1.0,"I buy costume jewelry all the time and in my opinion, it looks cheap.<br /> Not worth the price i paid $30.00"
1.0,The color said taupe but it was white and it looked like someone made a toga out of a silk sheet
1.0,"I asked for 4XL, as I like baggy and comfortable.  The only way these are a 4XL is if it's for a FAT KEN DOLL.  Very deceiving. DO NOT WASTE your money. Look at Hanes or Gildan before even thinking of buying these.  Amazon needs to take a closer look at who they deal with.  This is the 2nd bad delivery from Amazon TODAY (12/3/22).  The worse part,  they were two different brands of t-shirt, with different tags, and were in 3 vacuum sealed bags.  Not even professional packaging.  Total loser company, and product.  DO NOT BUY THESE.!!!"
1.0,Not satisfied too cheap feeling
1.0,"I loved it until I couldn't get that smell out! It smells like mildew!!! I tried to air it out, but my whole basement smelled like it.<br />Needless to say I'm am returning it."
1.0,"Maybe it was just the battery, but it was dead from the minute I unwrapped it.  I like the idea, and it looks good.  I am a volunteer firefighter and want a watch to wear outside my gear, tough enough but disposable (no great loss if destroyed or lost).  I can't access my wristwatch under turnout gear-need to keep track of time for safety reasons (such as, how long has a search team been in a burning building, how long since I last heard from them? Do they have enough air left to escape?  Do I need to call for more help, is my crew progressing in fighting this fire, or not?). This watch wouldn't even function as a paperweight.<br /><br />Do you have a reliable, cheap watch?"
1.0,"This brand is terrible. The quality is poor, the fit is completely off and there's even a tag with it that says it's made in China so the size you ordered &#34;may be different then the size you receive&#34;. What?!?! Very cheaply made and the fabric smells terrible. I put it on my almost 4 year old for ballet and she immediately said, &#34;mommy this leotard stinks! Please take it off&#34;. Sending it back immediately."
1.0,You'll have to have a very small head to wear this item. I like the tartan but I'll settle for a better made product that actually fits.
1.0,It ran 2 times smaller than expected.  Suggest to go up two sizex bigger
1.0,Really expensive plastic
1.0,"The mask arrived with a broken jaw bone.  It was snapped in the middle where the chin resides.  Additionally the jaw is held on by two machined bolts which were loose in the container.  Product advertised as a LED mask but there was not a single LED in sight nor any electronics to make them work.<br /><br />The kicker on all this...I had to PAY $17.00 to ship the broken, incorrect item back to the seller."
1.0,"Waited a long time for this to be delivered just to find that it is not how it appears in the pictures.  For the price you think you are getting quality.  It's very thin & cheaply made.  For this kind of money, I expected way more based off the pictures.  Don't like to leave negative reviews, but felt it needed to be shared."
1.0,PRODUCT EXTREMELY LARGE. MUCH TOO BIG FOR ADULT MALE. VERY THICK MATERIAL (NOT BREATHABLE). COMES VERY MIS-SHAPED DUE TO POOR PACKAGING. WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.
1.0,Wayyyyy too small and cheaply made
1.0,This mask arrived with no filter inside the ultimate protection of wearing the mask
1.0,The picture made it look bigger then it actually was.
1.0,I have not received the item as promised.
1.0,I bought two hats one for my daughter one for my wife receive both out the other day and one had a big hole in it
1.0,Two of the chains popped within the first week of purchase.
1.0,I don't even know if these are legitimate.  But please.  Save these for first responders and hospitals.  Do not order these for your personal use. Please.
1.0,Way too small. I ordered medium and it fits like an XS
1.0,This doesn't even kind of look like the dress in the photos & description.
1.0,Not at all the same dress as I ordered! I ordered navy and the dress I received was no where near navy! Also the dress is a heavy knit feeling where as in the picture it appears lighter and more chic! I would not recommend this dress!
1.0,good stuff but order a size or two bigger than your hand.
1.0,Expected an easy to put on my legs. It was not worth the extreme effort to have to deal with this every day. I will return them.
1.0,I normally wear a XL and I know sizes run small. I ordered an XXXL and it is more like a medium. Waste of my money and does not look like what is pictured
1.0,"Is there a way to activate this watch or does it come without a battery? I just received it and thankfully just in time for Mothers Day. However, it doesn't work! Can someone that received this already let me know if the was working when received? Or can the seller contact me? I went to the contact seller section and it brings me to amazon without the options that I need. Please and thanks."
1.0,My son loved the feel of these shoes but they lasted less than two months before a hole formed in the toe area.  I was hoping they would get him through summer...guess not.
1.0,This suit was extremely small. Looked like a child's size.  Couldn't return it because the cost to ship to China would be outrageous.  Instead I was given $6 back.
1.0,Loved the wings and center of bracelet. Disappointed not 925 completely .
1.0,I ordered a 3x.. Their packaging said 5x... still to small wth.  Sorry thin trash material as Well  would give less rating if i could
1.0,It broke as I was taking it out of the box. Very cheap plastic.
1.0,"I like the bag very much but after 2 days the side buckle of the shoulder strap broke, half of it is gone so the strap can't be use anymore. I can't find a way to connect to seller for a replacement of the buckle or the whole shoulder strap."
1.0,The measurements stated on the website are totally inaccurate. These earrings are much smaller than pictures show. The 18k gold plating is rubbing off in spots and the clasps either don't close smoothly or won't open up once closed. The workmanship is very poor on these earrings. The Charles and Colvard Moissanite stones are off color also. I would not pay a nickel for these earrings. Totally junk.
1.0,Charm fell off right away and it was very hard to open the coffin
1.0,They weren‚Äôt worth the money there was not much there and have very big price tag not worth it I sent them back
1.0,"I just received my wallet less than 10 minutes ago, and I'm already in the process of returning it. As soon as I opened the box, it had an overwhelming chemical smell! It feels like cheap plastic and you can see the holes in the seams from beginning to end. I had such high hopes for it. The only nice about it was the box it came. :-/"
1.0,Horrible product!..The size is for Child not an adult.I couldnt get it on pass my Knees!..The cuffs are horrible
1.0,"Looks really bad l, has a lot of armor gaps, too expensive, boots are huge, most pieces look disproportionate to the rest of the suit."
1.0,"It looses itself in the pocket, so the cloth also disappears all together with the pocket square holder."
1.0,"Big, heavy, and it hurt my wrist."
1.0,Horrible had to give it away
1.0,"These were much too small, I did have to return them. The size I intended to purchase was a large, what actually came in looked like a small."
1.0,"I ordered this in the blue color, and I knew immediately as I pulled it out of the packaging that this dress was not for me. It looks and feels SO CHEAP! The material is swishy almost like swimwear or something. Also the color is like a fluorescent blue. Looks nothing like the photos! Save your money on this one."
1.0,"These are a joke, I wear a size 9 and I couldn't get them on."
1.0,"Does not fit to size , if you order you need an extra size then your normal size"
1.0,"This is NOT the Hanes ""Comfort Soft"" style that I have been searching for. They are VERY thin.  They don't stay where they're supposed to.  They do not have double material in the gussest area for hygiene and absorbency.  The original comfort soft we're thicker, had stronger bands, and double material in the crotch area.<br /><br />Such a disappointment. Very cheap underwear."
1.0,If you need a pair of quick boots to wear ONE TIME .. these work... put it this way.. I wore for less than an hour and black on the soles wore off... plastic boot ... plastic quality... pleather
1.0,"These sunglasses did not look or fit like I had hoped, and the nosepiece broke literally within a minute of having them on. I tried returning but not sure what happened, because they say they never got them.... So was recharged. I would not recommend these sunglasses."
1.0,"The shorts were too tight. I ordered the appropriate size of 38 waist and they just stuck to me air-tight with no give. The attribute that worries me the most was as y bend over or squat down, the crotch area stitching is becoming exposed. Just not good quality"
1.0,"Bad sewing, poor quality, I can't even wear this shirt out! Save your money, don't buy this shirt!"
1.0,Totally misrepresented arrived broken
1.0,Was so excited to receive the earrings. The second time I went to wear them I was standing in the kitchen when I put them on. One earring dropped on the tile floor and broke!!! Wow...that's pretty fragile.
1.0,Did not work and it fell off and I lost it.
1.0,No reddish stripe as pictured...I would not have ordered if there were just black and white...without the third color they look a little like clown pants lol
1.0,Not as shown in photo.  Cheaply made.
1.0,Cute and seem comfortable but way too small for my 4 year old.
1.0,I have used this lanyard for a few weeks and it broke! So disappointed!
1.0,Bought these for my daughter for school which started Aug 27. She wore them ONE TIME and the blue bottom popped off the buckle!!!
1.0,It was really ugly in person
1.0,"I received an EMPTY BOX. And looking at the Q&A section of this product, I‚Äôm not the only one. This happens more often then not. Don‚Äôt bother"
1.0,"For the price I wasn't expecting this to be a world class product, but I did have the expectation that I could get more than a single use out of them.<br /><br />The instructions do say to &#34;hand wash&#34; and the reason is that if you do anything that resembles a more rigorous wash the seems will begin to fray and the edges will unfold.<br /><br />Pros: inexpensive, comfortable, does block the sun<br />Cons: poor quality construction, cannot machine wash without destroying the product"
1.0,I'm a US size 12 - I ordered the XL. Does not fit at all. I needed 3 or 4 sizes larger.
1.0,"The product is made up of cheap material, the logo was not straight, and it was super small for a medium! Super disappointedüòï"
1.0,They broke in half as soon as my husband put them on
1.0,"Real leather, I think. Loved it, but strap broke.  Xant use it.  Only my phone was in it. Should not have broke.  Saving it for receipts or something.<br /><br />Had to buy another sling for my phone.  DOnT BUY IT"
1.0,Purchased this a year ago to use in my  Scale Master II (digital plan measuring system).  Went to use it recently and it was dead after a handful of uses over the past year.  The Scale Master does have an automatic shut off after 5 minutes of nonuse.  Expected a lithium battery to last longer than  a handful of uses.
1.0,Actual cross is too big to fit into piercing. I did not send them back because the shipping was more than the earring. I do not recommend buying this product unless you have HUGE ears and your holes are spaced very far apart.
1.0,I bought this for my daughter to go with her Halloween costume after reviewing the sizes I got her size she should normally wear a size 10-12 as my daughter is very petite around 4ft 6 inches and around 60 pounds. The outfit did arrive fast but was so tight she couldn‚Äôt even put it on all the way. We right away noticed the quality of it was very poor strings hanging from the stitching but I was in need of a black unitard type outfit for her Halloween costume and was running short on time so we sent it back and got the next size up which was the biggest size they had which would be my size as I‚Äôm very petite as well. We got the new item again quickly but the new largest size item did not fit her again the stitching was unraveled in certain spots like the last one and the fabric was very itchy. I was again disappointed in this product the sizing is very off. We by luck found a much better item at Walmart before Halloween for her costume At least. I would not personally recommend this item.
1.0,The shorts themselves are cute but the padding is way to wide and incredibly uncomfortable.
1.0,"First, the socks are not comfortable. It definitely has a polyester feel to it. Not the comfy socks Im used too.<br />Second, you cannot see the whole libra logo. On one foot its cut off right at the seam. On the other sock same thing.<br />Third, the fit wasnt great. They didnt have enough stretch in them.<br />Is it worth it? No."
1.0,How do I get it on my watch?  The face doesnt fit in it
1.0,"I wish I could give this watch zero stars.<br />1. It‚Äôs tedious to program each individual alarm, and the instructions included aren‚Äôt great.<br />2. The pin holding the strap to the watch face fell out after 5 days of normal use by my 5 y/o, making it pretty much useless.<br />After spending an hour programming this thing, only to have it break within days is beyond frustrating. Save yourself time and money and get something else."
1.0,Shipped and Two months have gone by...
1.0,"Fortunately the surface coating had already started to wear off when I got the belt, so I returned it.  I'd never seen anything like it.  In order to get a real leather belt you must look for 'full grain leather', 'genuine leather' can mean anything."
1.0,"my left foot, ankle swollen from health condition, i was in pain putting this product on, and in pain taking this product off.  worst health product I have purchased"
1.0,The material is so cheap and the cut is not right. Too big and thin material. No good
1.0,Took 8 months to get the damn mask
1.0,"My son is a 12 yr he is a baseball player, he is fit but he is considered husky according to some manufracturers. These shirts we super small I did keep the longer sleeve ones to use as an under shirt for his uniform during the colder times we had here in florida. He also has a short torso right now he is going through a growth spirt so when I first got them (January) the were right below the button of his pants. But as of now (Febuary) they come up over he belly button lol after washing ect! I dont belive these shirts are really made for a ""huskier"" size boy. The shirts were pretty good quality but after one wash two of the short sleeve shirts had holes on the seams on the side of the shirts."
1.0,How disappointing!!!! Not only ran very late but the print is cut off so I have a mask that says (Reg Grinch FE) why bother ? Was really looking forward to receiving this even though I have made hundreds of masks myself this was suppose to be special. Rubbish
1.0,"After waiting for over a month for it to arrive, I wore it for less than two hours before it broke. Save your money."
1.0,I've got wierd neckline one.<br /><br />oneside is collard and one side is not.<br />is it refundable?
1.0,I dont really know how this would fit anyone appropriately.  It was really awkward on me.  I would consider myself a full figured gal with a substantial cup size and my boobs couldnt even start to fill up the top of that dress.  The good news----The seller will bargain with you on a reimbursement price. . . (?)
1.0,"Put off wearing these, they are tight and not comfortable"
1.0,"They look just like the photo.<br />Hubby‚Äôs  words after messing with the glasses were, ‚Äúthese are junk‚Äù!<br />I said, well you know your eye problem is not just normal vision issue. So I said, they took forever to get here and they will not take up much room, maybe someone can find use out of them later. Please stop and think about why you are having vision issues. If you can buy a pair of readers from the Dollar Store then you don‚Äôt want these. Honestly, I can‚Äôt think of a reason to buy these unless you want to have some kind of adjustable readers for an event when you or family can‚Äôt reach a doctor to get new readers. We can‚Äôt recommend these."
1.0,Omg just don‚Äôt.  They look so pretty.  Put on ur ear and you can NEVER take them off.  So if you want something permanent this is for you.  If you want to change out jewelry these will not unscrew once they are on.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the heat fusing the plastic threads but this was a nightmare getting off.
1.0,"I just received these pants. I ordered a pack of 3 in size 1X. They were about a size Medium. I'm so fed up with the Asian sizing. We're not Asian.<br />I'm tired of returning things and I was upset, so I threw them in the garbage. After washing they would've been even smaller and shorter. I'll never order plus size clothing from Amazon."
1.0,"I have always like B.O.C., when the styles are cute... I regret not buying more of what I already have/had. I soon need to replace my Wendell Penny loafers from B.O.C... since no one seems to have it, unless you buy used... thought I would try these out. Did not like it one bit. It‚Äôs not as comfortable and it looks like clogs. I returned them... I wish they would bring some of the old styles, including the flower sandals."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:24839c56a7ea2f66b8c580b2956b320a]] I received it 2 as ago and already the strap clip has broken off.
1.0,"The locket is a good size for a child and very shiney. A child will see it and love it, it even comes in a nice box. Do not even think of giving this to your wife or girlfriend, it is cheap and looks cheap on any kind of close inspection (the chain looks even cheaper than the locket). The inside is filled with colored enamel, there is no lip to hold a photo in place. You could of course stick pictures on to the colored enamel with some sort of adhesive.<br /><br />The fatal flaw in the design is that there are 3 rings that are not soldered closed. One is the ring that holds the heart to the chain, the others are two tiny rings on each end of the chain. All three are made of exceptionally thin soft metal. The slightest pull and one or all three will pull open. The result is that the two necklaces that we bought were both broken (and the lockets lost) literally within 15 minutes of being given as gifts to two little girls. It is a ten second job with some lead-free solder to weld the gaps in these three parts at which point the problem would be solved, it is a shame that the manufacturer did not take the time to make it correctly."
1.0,This bathing suit didn‚Äôt even come close to fitting. It gaps in multiple places and is overall just poorly made. I didn‚Äôt expect top quality but it was extremely disappointing.
1.0,made vision worse would not recommend
1.0,"Dont order this for Weiss. I hate giving bad reviews but this wig is actually awful. The wig that goes on your head is already prepped in a high pony tail which is all crooked. No big deal, just take it out of the pony tail and style yourself. WRONG. The moment you take it out of the pony tail you realize the hair strands are already molded to be in a weird shape and there is literally nothing you can about it. The base wig is also pretty long, over the shoulder length. You can try cutting it to a short length so you can just leave it down and clip in the long pony, but the hair strands are just so awfully placed all along the cap that that doesnt work either. It's just the worst wig. Do yourself a favor and invest in one of the pre made pony tail wigs from Arda"
1.0,These were trash I return them
1.0,"This product was very disappointing, but you get what you pay for, it was CHEAP!"
1.0,Could not hear the music very well
1.0,I have wore this belt maybe around 8 times and then it breaks.  Not a good solid belt and definitely not worth the money.  Very dissatisfied.
1.0,Horrible. I probably should have known better but I went against my better judgement. The skirt portion arrived looking like it was chewed up;it was frayed beyond belief. I wondered how someone actually placed it into packaging without noticing.
1.0,I read so many reviews before I decided on this when I got it sonsad it didnt fit like expected. Guess the biggest size is meant for a person who wears a medium.
1.0,I work foodservice and am responsible for putting away truck deliveries in a freezer. This takes about an hour and a half so very like usage; these gloves were okay for roughly a third of that time... I was taking breaks and just dealing with it since they were better than the last gloves I had but bye week 2 both zippers were broken now I return windows closed so certainly not worth the less than 8 wears I got out of them
1.0,"Hated it. I had high hopes as hubby has been looking for a mask the goes around the back of your head. Unfortunately, the top elastic just slides down to the bottom one, making it pretty useless. It is definitely NOT glasses friendly. It fogs up my glasses immediately. Also, the fabric pills as soon as it is washed. If you have rough hands, this will stick to them most uncomfortably. Ordered two and the elastic on one of them was incorrectly threaded into the toggle, it was a pain in the butt. Unfortunately, I cannot think of any redeeming qualities."
1.0,Not very well made and runs small.
1.0,Nylon hosiery material was
1.0,They ran to big even after washing. So I could not return them. Wasted money. The tops are to tight and made legs swell. Bad purchase.
1.0,"It didn't work from day one! All it would do was go through a test mode, this is after I finally got it to charge long enough to stay on. Very disappointed little girl on Christmas!"
1.0,"Fit great, were wonderful for less than 2 months, they have totally failed.<br />The sole padding are completely crushed and the slippers have become real loose on the foot from stretching side to side,  I weigh 190 lbs. Do not recommend."
1.0,This is nothing like the picture. DO NOT buy this cheaply made piece of garbage. It's just t-shirt material and not the type of fabric pictured. Disappointed.
1.0,I never washed it and I could see tiny threads coming out. It it still held together but not good quality. I wanted a hat that could fit my thick curly hair under it. It can fit my curls but it's so cheap it tore.
1.0,Waste of my time big enough for an elephant
1.0,I know you usually get what you pay for but the one of the larger earrings split down the middle the second time I wore it.
1.0,Can't use it is too big
1.0,This is just plastic and you can‚Äôt breath with this on.
1.0,Product is not as fitting as the competitor brand.without realizing this is a different brand all together
1.0,These shrank 2 sites when my husband left them in the car. Frustrating! Keep out of sun if you buy this brand.
1.0,Very small rastaclat
1.0,I saw this advertised on facebook for more money. Bought it on amazon for less and it was a total misleading rip off. Impossible to get on legs using a sock kit.
1.0,These were for my granddaughter in Virginia.
1.0,It‚Äôs so cheaply made and it has been a nightmare trying to return the dress! Finally thanks to Amazon they stepped in a gave me a full refund and told me not to worry about shipping it back. So I donated the dress to Goodwill. Maybe someone that can sew can use the material ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1.0,The dress is pretty cheaply made. Though only paying $25 I guess you don‚Äôt expect much. The material is shiny and the design looks screen printed. It‚Äôs not nearly as nice as the pictures. Fits well though.
1.0,"My son wore these once and they ripped in two places, the day after we bought them. He‚Äôs hard on his clothes but still I was very disappointed.  They didn‚Äôt even last 24 hours üôÅ"
1.0,The quantity and price drew me in to order. Upon receiving my order how ever there we so many duplicates and half of what was in the pictures was not in the batch I recieved. Disappointing...
1.0,way too small!!!!
1.0,Stopped working<br />Very flimsy<br />Made buzzing noise<br />Child very unhappy on Halloween
1.0,I received the wrong product. I just got a surgical mask... trying to return it now.
1.0,I bought this product for my husband for Christmas. It is now the beginning of April and the sole of the slipper has separated from the bottom.  Expect some normal wear and tear but not in three months since we bought them.
1.0,I received a different purse than what was pictured.
1.0,"I went by the sizing guide and it was way too large.  Material was not like a sweater but was a thin, cheap polyester-type.  I had to return it."
1.0,"So disappointed in this order!! I was sooo looking forward to these leggings after seeing awesome reviews on amazon and YouTube. I ran home from work.. went to try them on.. and right away was just a little disappointed in the fit on my butt area. They fit great on the front but the back of the pants did not have much stretch, pull up over my butt, or stay in place when I bent over... (they still looked great) a little discouraged I just took them off. I decided to try them on again later to see if maybe it was just me... and bamn. THEY RIPPED. Right in the middle by the crotch. DISAPPOINTED is an understatement. For the record I am 5‚Äô9 and 150... ordered a medium. They were not too small according to the other reviews and the description. *sigh* guess I will go back to researching ‚Äúgood quality amazon leggings for a good price. ‚Äù"
1.0,I received the incorrect product. Not the one pictured. It was flared at the bottom and had a tie in back.
1.0,We bought this thinking it was a dino charge saber like my son previously had that had gotten broken that he loved.  What we got was a junky plastic piece that doesn't do anything and is similar to dollar store item (or worse).  The quality is terrible and item cheaply made.
1.0,"I got the navy one with colorful hearts. It did not lay in an a-line like was pictured. It fit my waist but there was so much puffy material, it was huge and I looked huge. The fabric was shiny and just not what I expected. However the return process was excellent. So easy and they refunded me right way."
1.0,Came broke had to return sadly
1.0,I wanted to send this back but the return cost was going to be quadruple the cost of what it originally cost.  So I guess I'm stuck with it.
1.0,Not worth. very bad quality
1.0,"Very disappointed, you can barely see the stones as well as read the names. It looks very ordinary. Do not buy it"
1.0,"At the rate this boa sheds, I will be able to use it only two or three times."
1.0,Broke in 2 months. Refund period finished.. don't waste your money
1.0,"I'm very disappointed. I absolutely love the necklace, it arrived today  but it broke on me within 5 hours of wearing it. And no, I wasn't doing anything strenuous, I was driving."
1.0,This purse was much much smaller than I anticipated. I bought for my 10yr granddaughter... not impressed
1.0,"All the zippers broke the first day I used it, and all of the hardware broke within the first 2 uses. It's cheaply made, if that doesn't matter to you its a cute purse."
1.0,These are too short for my toddler's hand and cheap quality. Would not waste your time with these.
1.0,"Bought these lights to give away to our friends kids for the holidays. I would not have bought them if it stated the truth, ALL 40 lights mixed up in ONE cheap sandwich bag. Not retail packaging, more like returns got a new life. Not the end of the world if your going to use them yourselfs, but I bought these to give away to kids as party favors for our Christmas party. The product discription clearly states 4 diffrent color lights in one package times 10 = 40 lights. Guys just say what your selling and its up to the consumer to buy or not, just dont B# and waist peeps time. Cannot comment on longevity of the lights/battery as I just recieved them. Quality is ok and acceptable for the price."
1.0,"This isn‚Äôt a 6.5 it‚Äôs a 6 it says so on the box, with that being said it‚Äôs way too small"
1.0,"Extremely too small.  Couldn‚Äôt get it up past my thighs.  Now way in hell is this an XL.  Material has absolutely NO give, and the fabric feels cheap."
1.0,No pins either.. B.S.
1.0,"I got a small and it fits like a large, way to baggy and crappy stitching. Save your money and get something else."
1.0,Bad quality and don‚Äôt worth the price
1.0,I love this type of jeans...unfortunately I got the wrong size so I‚Äôll have to send them back
1.0,Boots worn a few hours a day 5 days a week and after 4 weeks have alreay started separating between the sole and leather upper.
1.0,The top where the cherries are has absolutely no stretch. The shoes themselves are absolutely adorable and good quality but it‚Äôs too tight across the foot to fit comfortably. Had to return.
1.0,Keeps good time. Date keeper is in the crapper!!!
1.0,"Tiny!  I buy medium in most brands, sometimes small bc I'm short.  This thing is tiny!  Size up 3 sizes if you want it to not dig in and show nip!"
1.0,"I'd show you the shirt, except I had to throw it away after the whole thing unraveled during it's first wash. Regret buying this. Don't waste your money."
1.0,If I could give it a half star I would ordered two size bigger due to the fact I work outside in all types of weather so during the winter I have on layers. Still too small with just one layer of clothing.
1.0,"The fit is just loose and awkward, not a fan of the material either"
1.0,The sweater was listed as oversized and a large.  It was in reality a small.  The package said large but there was no size on the sweater.  Seller would not send a return label and expected me to pay for the return.  I‚Äôm out $47.00. Grrrrr!
1.0,"After my first use of it, it got ripped. I wasn‚Äôt even working out it just ripped taking it off."
1.0,Too small for son
1.0,Developed hole after first wearing!
1.0,The actual lense was way to small to see out of
1.0,This is NOT a 3√ó5 flag as advertized.<br /><br />Its measured at 2√ó4.  However the zip slide lock bag shows a barcode and 3√ó5 size.  It is NOT that size.  Sadly a total disappointment.  GARBAGE!
1.0,Blouse came with a hole in the  torso region.........i guess we know why the blouse is priced the way it is
1.0,"Liked the look, but they broke after 1 wearing."
1.0,If you want to have a good laugh buy this dress. This dress was about 4 sizes too small. Cheap cheap fabric just no. I think the pictures are from another vendor my mistake and n not ordering elsewhere with good reviews
1.0,This romper did not fit me good at all. It was too large or too small in all the wrong places.
1.0,Returned as it was too big and not as nice as I expected
1.0,returned..lost color and appeared dark and blotchy after one day of use
1.0,One of the stones was missing and had no safety pin or pins to safe the earing from behind was so disappointed üòûüòîüòï
1.0,This item is made out of super cheap material. I ended up returning it. It's not worth it. You might as well goto the dollar store
1.0,"I‚Äôm tall and like this brand, because it tends to run long. This particular shirt has extra long sleeves, but the waist shaping is cut for a short person. It looked very unflattering."
1.0,Not at all what I wanted. And did a was not correct
1.0,They are labeled as Men‚Äôs Crew socks.... not even close... very thin and very small and short. Would never fit my husband. I kept them for myself or guest when they need a pair of socks that I don‚Äôt mind them keeping... very misleading description
1.0,Items look Luke they were tampered with. Missing some masks. Only received 7 in one package.
1.0,barely wore it and now the stitching is falling apart. I wish they would send me a replacement it's my 4th style I've purchased this year.
1.0,"Purchased this because I loved the black version. Sadly, my first and only attempt to wear it ended when I pulled at an errant string hanging off the sleeve and the whole sweater ""unzipped"" all the way down the arm right to the waistband. Needless to say, I'm getting a refund."
1.0,Totally different than pictured and it was broken so my husband had to fix it.
1.0,Seams ripped the first time I put it on. I expected better construction from North Face. Got a slightly more expensive but tougher one from Eddie Bauer.
1.0,This took sometime to get to me and then it was not as nice either.  The fabric was not of a nice quality or comfortable and the size is not correct.  I even ordered a larger size as I was going to use this after surgery.  This did not even fit me before surgery when I tried it on right when I received the item.  I sent it right back. Very disappointed in the product itself.  It is lucky to get even the 1 star.
1.0,The string isn‚Äôt attached it doesn‚Äôt close the dress. I can never wear this out of the house very cheap print.
1.0,"The septum ring is supposed to be magnetic, however, it never stuck to my nose. It didn't work at all."
1.0,Dress did not look like the picture at all.
1.0,This is a set ‚Ä¶ I never received the necklace... only the bracelet. Not Happy!
1.0,Not made of tungsten for sure and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs stainless steel. Finish wore off in just a few weeks
1.0,Horrible quality and run super small
1.0,Never got the right glasses and had to settle for some Oakley glasses and was offered a 20% discount and fight to get 50% back when I don‚Äôt even want these glasses ! Horrible !
1.0,Liked boxers but mad that the large jammies fit him but the large boxers in same brand didnt.
1.0,I got and xl and it fit like a men's size medium.<br />I usually buy XL mens shirts because they're baggy on me and it's nicer to wear to my job where I'm walking all day. But this was snug.<br /><br />Would have rebought it in a 2xl if they had it because I love the design and feel...
1.0,Muy peque√±a la medida
1.0,"Tie holder on back was half torn off, threading was coming undone, and the tie was just stuffed in a bag and super wrinkly."
1.0,I received ONE plug. Im not really sure what to do with this now ü§¶üèª
1.0,"Really it is too bad , very weak quality it was bent after first wear<br />Really i am very disappointed"
1.0,Jewelry was rusty.
1.0,Poor quality.  Zipper pull broke on first use.  Contact with the manufacturer was a nightmare with no resolution.  I did not buy on Amazon.
1.0,Absolutely hate the material! It‚Äôs horrific for hot summer days!
1.0,Sizing is not appropriate.
1.0,The hat overall is a good hat its just that the trd logo is like a puke orange instead of the red it shows In the pictures
1.0,I didn't like this dress. Fabric felt cheap.  Returned it.
1.0,"Missing a stone.  This was a Santa gift, so I need to return without my child noticing."
1.0,"There is a misspelling on this mask. It‚Äôs supposed to be ‚ÄúMerry,‚Äù not ‚ÄúMarry.‚Äù"
1.0,It ws a large and it fit like a kids shirt the length was at my waist. I gave it to a middle school niece of mine. Loose Long is false advertising unless you are 3 feet tall.
1.0,Poor quality the material and fabric is garbage
1.0,I bought a 2XL and might as well have been a small‚Ä¶smh
1.0,Nike symbol came off in a couple days
1.0,I found these shoes too thin and not very supportive. I would probably not buy Ryka's from Amazon again.
1.0,"Ugly, cheap-looking, sloppy painting, huge and bright!!!!"
1.0,Nothing like the picture!!!
1.0,Color in person is more salmon than hot pink. Belt has horrible smell.
1.0,Clasp comes undone
1.0,Beautiful colors and quality I just didn‚Äôt like the tie back masks. I thought they went behind the ears mask. But that was my fault for not checking
1.0,"Major disappointment, expected better from Lynch! This call was squeaky and squaky out of the package, obviously made out of country now as it does not state MADE IN USA anywhere on website or package."
1.0,I do not recommend these gloves. After light wear seams failed in two places resulting in openings that will inevitably get worse.
1.0,Sleeves are made incorrectly. Both sides say half cold. Even though one side's flames and the other sides ice. We got a second one and it had the same error. Recommend not buying
1.0,Took size in to consideration order accordingly it‚Äôs way way to big<br />I contacted them to return for the correct size and was told<br />There is nothing they can do<br />I should order another one in the size I want<br />But would not take the other one back<br />So now I am stuck with a dress I can‚Äôt wear
1.0,The fabric used is very weird. It‚Äôs like a thin silky neoprene fabric. Not what I expected at all. It offerers no warmth at all. It‚Äôs actually cold.
1.0,Trash and tarnished. Literally broke off in my earlobe which was incredibly painful to remove.
1.0,Cheap looking and too big
1.0,"doesnt stay on, and didnt match the band I had bought with it."
1.0,I purchased this band on December 6th and last week it fell apart. The shiny pieces just peeled off from the band
1.0,Bought the sweater in Small Size. Was much larger than my other Medium sized hoodies. Parts of the hoodie look poorly stitched and fabric felt/looks cheap.
1.0,I got the product almost 1 month after I had to order a second time didn‚Äôt like the rustle
1.0,"This is not made of cotton, almost spandex type material but really loose.  Not cute at all!  Don't waste your time and money on ordering."
1.0,Nice looking but impossible to set the time and coordinate the functions.
1.0,"Too short on the l bend, hurts to insert. Pretty but not sure if I will be able to wear them."
1.0,Fell apart first time on watch üò©
1.0,This product snags all of my clothes and catches on everything.  The edges are extremely rough and have scratched my arms.  I don't recommend this product.
1.0,These are not compression tanks at all. My fat rolls were flapping like a turkey neck.
1.0,not worth the price.
1.0,"I‚Äôm usually a fan of MdnMd leotards and their fit, but this one must have been cut wrong. While the top fit perfect, the bottom was very loose and saggy. It definitely would not have been appropriate to wear to a dance class because the private areas were not covered well. The size and fit was not consistent with other MdnMd 120/4-6yr old leotards we own."
1.0,Se pone negra la cadena a√∫n sin usar
1.0,"looks and feels cheap, very flimsy"
1.0,"The pictures are deceiving - the color is not close to the brilliant Citrine color in the Amazon listing. They are a very pale yellow. This is disappointing, as I purchased these specifically to match another piece of Citrine jewelry purchased elsewhere. Will be returning."
1.0,The fit was to large
1.0,"For a shoe described as water-resistant, I expected more. I was looking for a pair of minimalist shoes that would hold up OK in light-to-moderate rain. I avoid walking in puddles --- we're talking about walking on wet ground in light rain while carrying an umbrella. Twenty minutes of that and my feet are pretty wet. Beyond that, the shoes are not especially comfortable or stylish."
1.0,Super uncomfortable and left tarnish marks on my skin
1.0,For the tinest wrist ever!
1.0,"I thought it would be a red color, instead it is a dark pink color like raspberry"
1.0,Look ok but size is way to small.
1.0,Hard to unwrinkle not great quality
1.0,Terrible quality and half of them came broken.
1.0,The fabric is cheap and slippery and the seams are oddly located.
1.0,sizes way off. was not near big enough for my bust even though it said it would be.
1.0,Very cheap!!! Bought for my boyfriend and never gave it to him as it looks like plastic! He used to have a Casio watch very similar to this but this one is a piece of junk. I returned
1.0,Item showed up broken!!!
1.0,"Not true to size. 2 sizes too big, legs width was super wide and length was way to long."
1.0,Had the glasses for about 2 1/2 months and they broke on me already.  Bought them for work and very disappointed with them.
1.0,"beautiful piece n very delicate, one problem it broke within first week"
1.0,Product is made out of a cheap itchy material.
1.0,"The size is way off, size 18 plus can fit a child size 10 and the material has a foul order.<br />I will not order from this vendor!"
1.0,"Was not expecting much for the price, but was at least expecting them to be functional. They won't close- they keep bending out of place. I spent 20 minutes just trying to put them in my right ear, couldn't close any of the 3 earrings. They're just going to fall out. Terrible product."
1.0,Poor quality.. This is not a leather belt! polyurethane
1.0,Arrived super fast. I first wrote a great review but i put it on and it just broke. I'm so disappointed. Will ask for refund but it is not worth the $&
1.0,"Below is my original review after seeing the charm in it's package.  I am soo disappointed as I thought the charm so beautiful.  However, as I took off the clear bag it came in, two of the stones had already fallen off before I even touched it.  I liked the charm so much I almost asked for a replacement, however, I figured if it already fell apart  before I touched it, then it is not of good quality and would most likely just fall apart again.  I would rather  have paid more for this charm and have it be quality than a cheap quality charm.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />I just received my swan and had to write a review so soon because the swan is so lovely.  It looks much better in person.  I have charms I hold on a key ring to hang on my purse and this almost makes the other ones look shabby!  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.  It looks like something you would buy from a high priced Boutique store.  I;ll be buying more as gifts.  You can't go wrong with this beautiful swan.  I'll be interested in how it holds up.  But for now, I am very happy with my purchase."
1.0,Didn't fit well and I sent it back.  The padding was a joke.
1.0,Wouldn't fit in my lip. Then struggled so much with it my piercing got irritated and closed up. Had it pierced for 2 1/2 months.
1.0,"Cheap tangled and not worth the dollar spent. Worn for about an hour and had to take it off. Scratchy, poor quality metal made my skin itch. I'll throw this piece away."
1.0,Center stone tilted. Looks horrible.
1.0,Very cheap chain. Probably will not wear this at all.
1.0,Aa soon as I opened the package the first thing I notice was this huge gouge in the shoe. Looks like it cane from a secondhand store
1.0,Very dark. Doesn't look nice and vibrant like picture.
1.0,"I was able to wear it one time and stones fell out, pretty but poor quality."
1.0,This key chain completely fell apart - returned product
1.0,"Soft, but see tag.."
1.0,Pretty bag however the zipper already broke on the bag.
1.0,"This has just arrived, and it didn't come with the leather mallet and also didn't play. At all. I'm returning and getting my money back right away."
1.0,Just got to the store . the dollar store easier tonset time . I had family memebers try to set this watch . instrustions dont help you
1.0,So the only issue I had was keeping this in one spot. I used this for a medusa piercing and the flatback part wants to slid out from your lip. It wouldn't stay
1.0,Lights didn't work.
1.0,"The hat fits well, but the logo isn‚Äôt embroidered, it‚Äôs just a cheap iron on hellcat logo. I think I‚Äôm gonna return it, looks so cheap. I‚Äôm kind of pissed that they made the hat pics look like the logo was embroidered.<br /><br />Def will not order from these clowns ever again. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1.0,The mask is really cool. But i do have some complains about it.....its too big. Movies alot while walking also its really hard to see at night .
1.0,Bad product. One side was not stitched up. I did not realize this until I got ready to wear it when I was on vacation. I ordered it early so that I will have it for my vacation and I could not send back because the time had expired to return it. Bad quality control. They should have seen this before sending it out to the customer.
1.0,Unfortunately they are very poorly made. TheY are very cute however they are very thin and too flabby..
1.0,"I am a 40 DD and ordered the xxl.  It was super tight.  I had ordered a similar shirt and it fir perfect, but this one will be going back.<br />On the positive side the blue is absolutely goregeous."
1.0,I have never written a bad review on Amazon. This product will be my first. Save your money! This bra does not stick longer than 5 seconds. I didn't even bother going outside with it since I felt and saw the bra slip right off.
1.0,Not at all what I thought expected to be solid and not flimsy. Very disappointed
1.0,This has a very odd cut which ends up enhancing my stomach area and making it appear larger than it actually is.  Granted I'm not a skinny girl but I do not want to accentuate my flaws.
1.0,Can still see the glue and my 2 year old wore hers twice and one strapped came off
1.0,"I didn't expect top notch, but I didn't expect super cheap looking either. Some of these were tiny and not dangling. One pair had a post broken as soon as I got it out of the package. I will probably be sending them back."
1.0,"These were absolutely gorgeous but they are horribly made. They are cheap material. They claim these are stainless steal but they were rusting in my ears. My husband had to help me get them off with pliers because I couldn‚Äôt move the thread, which also freaking rusted. Do yourself a favor and and DON‚ÄôT buy these POS plugs."
1.0,Asian sizes.  Not American/EU.  The Extra Large will not fit a US size 11/12
1.0,"It was so itchy my son wouldn't wear it. He put it on, and started scratching within a couple minutes.  Maybe it's good for layering?  Wear a cotton sock underneath then put these on?  Either way, we had to toss them."
1.0,"If I could give it zero stars I would, sizing scale is a joke!! I read some reviews to order 1 size bigger so I did. I normally wear a 2xl so I ordered a 3xl. The 3xl jacket fit like a medium. The sizing scale is either from the Keebler elf's or Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompa's. Fix the sizing chart or start making 7xl for us taller men!!"
1.0,These only dim the glasses a little bit there is still a glare I don't recommend these and they didn't do justice for me
1.0,"The hat was way too loose, does Not fit tightly on head. Does Not keep head warm. Bought a different one from a different company $3-4 more. The second I bought from the other company fit much better and keeps my head warm."
1.0,Wrong item came it is an HR Michael from China that I received and that is why it was a completely differently color and the Material was completely different it was sheet material
1.0,They sre to tight and hurt
1.0,I received this watch as a gift. I really liked the style and wore this watch everyday. After about a month that second hand fell off. Two weeks later the battery died. What a disappointment.
1.0,The clasp on the back snapped off when I tried to put it on for the first time.
1.0,"Other than being ugly, the material is cheap. No one in my house wants it. No one. And two of them are young women who wear hats most of the time."
1.0,"Straight out of the package, the metal underwire was already poking out both ends of the cup. The cups only have a thin mesh for a liner and then a flimsy black fabric toward the bottom of the cups in a crescent moon shape that reminds me of a nursing bra except it doesn't cover anything. If the tankini top floated up in the water (and you know it does, ladies) its a full show with the transparent mesh. Zero support. Zero padding or protection from the underwire. I was so disappointed since the patterned fabric was light and offered a flattering fall over the trouble tummy area. Still way too big and there is no way I'd pay more than $10 for a smaller size, it is so flimsy and cheaply made. Not to mention, it is only the TOP - it's twice the price for half the suit and far less in quality of other suits on here."
1.0,"The picture online is not an accurate representation of the shirt. The ink/logo looks pix-elated, almost like it was stretched out to the point where it looks blurry and undefined. Very disappointing."
1.0,Tarnish almost immediately
1.0,"I do not recommend, looks cheap."
1.0,"I ordered 2 pairs of these water shoes for 11 and 7 year old daughters, they used them in the first day and the seams ripped open within an hour.  I've attached pictures, I'm so disappointed!"
1.0,"I bought a median size for my wife, but it's very very very small. Don't understand why a median size does not  mean median.<br />Don't buy this product, you'll have a problem."
1.0,These socks are extremely elastic all over more like a polyester stretch sock. They only have a small label that says made in china. No brand name. No fabric content. They are well made but I am not convinced of the the cotton content since they feel totally different from a Hanes high % cotton sock.
1.0,Holes in product . I have pictures from the delivery date / unpacking
1.0,Returned due to poor material and fit. Very disappointed in the quality of the jacket.
1.0,"When I took it out of the package the first thing I noticed was the horrible smell. It's so strong and it absolutely REEKS and I don't know how to even describe it other than maybe burnt plastic? The material the hoodie itself is made of feels incredibly weird and uncomfortable and cheap-feeling. I ordered a 3XL because usually I'm an XL and I wanted it to fit baggy. It fits more like a large and I can BARELY get it on. Don't waste your money, honestly. You'd have better luck waiting for a merch restock than this piece of junk."
1.0,Bottom is completely see through dry. Can not imagine how bad it would be if it was wet. Beware
1.0,didn't like it sucks
1.0,The color is a completely different color .. very unsatified I have a wedding in 2 weeks and the color is all wrong. Will not purchase again..
1.0,Smaller than inspected. Plus it took longer than posted and they would not let cancel the order
1.0,Started to unravel with first wear.
1.0,Way too small! Ordered a 2xl and it's very small. It's more like a junior size medium. There is nothing lose fitting about his top. Very disappointed! Will be returning this.
1.0,Unless your kid has extremely narrow feet (and mine has pretty narrow feet) they will not fit. Save your money.
1.0,I got the wrong size that I didn't order.
1.0,"Besides the size is way too small for L (Chinese L is the American SX)- it's not cotton as it was stated wrongly, it's a lycra polyester, which I would never wear."
1.0,"I purchased these because I figured they would fit the best due to swelling and also have the needed compression.  These things are nothing more then an overpriced ill shaped sock. They have zero compression and the ""silicon"" band is an absolute joke. I can't wear these things."
1.0,Returned this dress.  Just didn't like the fit.
1.0,"I am very disappointed in this item.  I bought it as a gift and her parents had asked for a sweatsuit.  Although the caption called it a sweatsuit, it is simply a lightweight cotton top and pants.  In spite of that, I might have kept it if I hadn't read the care label and found out that it was hand wash only.  Does anybody really buy hand wash only clothes for everyday wear for a toddler?  I will be sending this back tomorrow morning.<br /><br />By the way, I have no idea if it &#34;fit as expected&#34; -- the website required my to pick a category on fit before I could write my review so I just picked that randomly!<br /><br />On a more humorous note, this product was made in China (no, I did not see that mentioned in the online description) and they need a better translator -- I especially enjoyed &#34;no not tumdle dry&#34; and &#34;do not bleachwit&#34;."
1.0,Material was cheap doesn‚Äôt feel very soft.
1.0,This is WAY too short to be considered a dress. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù.  It‚Äôs more like a long blouse.  It‚Äôs also very thin.  It‚Äôs being returned.
1.0,"Im very disapointed, it is such a cute skirt, Im always a size 4 in bottoms but the slip underneath this skirt in a size 4 would no go over my butt. the top layer im sure would have fit fine, and if i go up a size it would be to large on my waist, it was already pretty loose. Wierd fit, probably best for a non curvy girl."
1.0,It‚Äôs a great jacket and fit great. Only problem I had was it had to be washed about 7 times to get the cigarette smell off that it came with before I could even wear it. That was very disappointing!
1.0,"Very cheap, arrived broken."
1.0,"This item doesn‚Äôt work. It was too loose/ big for my perry ellis luggage. Did not have a snug fit and was not a good design for my needs. The strap was great but that was it.  I don‚Äôt recommend for fitting over luggage handle. The material is not waterproof nor is it easu to wipe / clean. It wouldn‚Äôt hold my 40 oz hydroflask. I purchased another one and everything fit perfectly for my needs, the other one  did not have a shoulder strap but it worked better (sorry can‚Äôt remember the name) but it was pink."
1.0,I wear XL.  This shirt fits snug like a Large
1.0,"Very cheaply made. Feels and looks nothing like the original Fossil watch strap. Doesn't bend well. And the metal feels gross. I didn't even bother putting it on my watch-- I opened the package, felt the metal, sealed it right back up, and shipped it back."
1.0,I wear size Small normally. This size small is like xs or xxs
1.0,Do not buy!!The buttons do not line up!! Ugly ugly ugly!!
1.0,Save your money and get a better band. This band even after making adjustments with the tools still feel apart.  I followed all of the instructions and it still didn't work properly.
1.0,"Lock design not very good<br /><br />Set both bags lock with another person looking to be certain opened it a couple times, for example it worked, then wouldn't open<br />No apparent way to reset again"
1.0,"I bought this ring because it SPECIFICALLY said it wouldn‚Äôt tarnish, or turn your skin a different color. It started turning my skin green after TWO DAYS."
1.0,"I got scammed. I did not get the boot that I ordered, I received Something that looks like them but not the boot that has JLB on it.  no logo on these boots at all, I feel like I got a knock off. I am not happy that I did not get the boot I wanted...."
1.0,You get what you pay for... this dress is far too sheer to wear alone. You could see my undergarmets right through it. Returned it for a refund.
1.0,"I should have read reviews, the 6x looks like a 2t/3t size and the design is printed at an angle. I might try to return for two sizes up and hope the next one has a level print. If your thinking about buying just get a different one, this isn‚Äôt worth it."
1.0,Quality hat but Winchester is like sticker
1.0,"Dont buy,bad prodict"
1.0,"disliked how see thru (thin) the top was.  Not made well.  Only came with pinafore, top and 2 ribbons for $60.  :("
1.0,I couldn't choose a size. The dress is way to big. I usually wear a small or XS and this fits way to big. Looks like a Large to me. Material is very stretchy but the dress looks very cheap.
1.0,Feathers shedding very skimpy
1.0,It's incredible how think these actually are. Way too thin; they pinch and hurt.
1.0,"Cameo is cute, however it's plastic & chain was cheap & did nor match the material of the cameo frame. Definitely NOT worth the price..  Save your money & shop elsewhere."
1.0,Frayed and broke within a week.
1.0,One pump not working correctly.
1.0,"Cheaply made. Sleeve cuff seams fell out after one time wear. Zipper is hard to zip, and feels as though it will break."
1.0,"In general , it wasn't  good at apparel design image in a whole piece of dress."
1.0,cheap looking...no shape to it....
1.0,Too small and very cheap.  This will be the last top I order online without seeing it in person first.  So tired of having to return these tops because of the quality and size.
1.0,The dress didn't fit maybe if it did I would be able to give it a fair rating.
1.0,Flimsy plastic hooks with gaps on both ends. The chin cord and hat fixture joint will easily come off from the gaps. They are useless and trouble making. Do not buy!
1.0,"UGLY, don't bother. Not made for American normal sizing."
1.0,"I love the look of this dress and it is very flattering on, however the rings that hold the straps to the garment are REALLY thin and strap broke within two minutes of me having the dress on. Disappointed."
1.0,Necklace was completely broken in half
1.0,Horrible and ugly! Do not waste you money! Horrible material!
1.0,It worked good when I first got it then after I used it for about 2 weeks the clamp broke and won't close and the metal bends easy!
1.0,Waste if money
1.0,"It is seldom I write a bad review as I realize that sometimes things aren't always the way we expect - BUT I<br />was so excited for this bracelet, ordered two. So very disappointed. The picture inside both bracelets is far too big to see- wasn't aware I should have scaled it myself to fit inside the bracelet? Thought that might be included with the purchase.<br /> Also, one of the bracelets is now stuck in the inside box as the ribbon broke.<br />Cute idea but certainly not well executed. Am sending back as soon as I have acknowledgment from the company."
1.0,Far too large - I ordered a XL and received an XXXL - WHY
1.0,"I purchased this band for my 42mm smart watch. I selected the correct size and was excited to receive the item. Unfortunately, the item does not fit my watch, and by the looks of the case that surrounds the watch, the material is not quality."
1.0,Decal peeled off during first wash. Ruined jacket.
1.0,"Very disappointed with this product. If I could give no stars, I would. The elastic broke after 3 weeks and it was not a cheap bracelet. Of course the return policy is 30 days so by the time I went to return it I couldn't. Complete waste of money."
1.0,Another product from China. The material is cheap. Haven‚Äôt even opened the product to see this
1.0,parecen sombreros para sembrar frijoles.  horrible!!!
1.0,"Cheap quality, paper thin material for top, sequins don't shine at all and the skirt this horribly wrong in measurements. Costumer service is bad."
1.0,Zipper fell apart after only a week of use.  Poorly mad. Do not waste your $$
1.0,Meh!
1.0,All gems fell out within a month. Horrible
1.0,"These socks are NOT like the ""hospital socks"" at all! HATE I have 5 pair going to waste. What I thought would fit maybe a size 12 foot fits more like a 7/8"
1.0,"All in the title. First time daughter went into the pool, the whole frame came apart."
1.0,"I bought this to wear in the summer with a white blouse and jeans.  It is cheap looking, cheaply made, looks like something that Goodwill refused.  It is no where the size it purports to be, it is made in China, which pretty much explains why is is so bad.  However, the lace inlays are ok."
1.0,"It‚Äôs weird fitting, not the material that it looks like in the image, and it was not appealing at all. I would not recommend"
1.0,"these fit kind of weird,the center of the butt poofs out while the sides are snug,<br />the sequins are horrible,theyre extremely uncomfortable,im working on finding undies that are the same exact cut as these to wear under-most t underwear end up showing out the sides or dont cover the sequins,<br />really had high hopes for these,but im terribly disapointed<br />ordered in a size bigger than normal,and theyre still a tiny bit snug,<br />as i said-they just fit awkward in general<br /><br />do urself a favor and spend the extra money on a better quality pair that arent going to be annoying and uncomfortable to wear the whole time<br />also with these,if your not careful putting them on,the shorts will get caught and snag if you have fishnets on,"
1.0,Lens were completely scratched up upon arrival - looks like a QA issue rather than a delivery issue. Color is cool though.
1.0,Not at all like expected. Disappointed.
1.0,"just don't waste your money on this product. Its made cheaply and is not worth the hassle, i bought it for prescription glasses cause i love the style and it broke a couple months later just don't buy it. spend more money for a better product."
1.0,"It didn‚Äôt arrive on the day it was supposed to. Once arrived, the material was thin and cheap"
1.0,FALSELY ADVERTISED as 100% real LEATHER....but it is really 100% PVC!!! Do not waste your money!
1.0,They don‚Äôt even last putting it on without it breaking! These necklaces are made of cheap material. Even putting it on it breaks. I had maybe one necklace that didn‚Äôt break but it turned my neck green. Cheap is what you pay cheap is what you get!!
1.0,"The color of this shirt is NOT the same as shown. When I received it, it was more of a dark navy color and it the material is not what I thought it was going to be.  It looked like a softer material in the picture, but it felt stiff.  I bought XL (which is what I normally wear) but it felt a little snug through the arms. Although, it was easy to return through Amazon, I  would not buy again."
1.0,Terribly disappointed. Ring looks nice but doesn't glow even the slightest in the dark.
1.0,The blouse I received doesn't match the picture or description that I ordered. It's more of a beige than an apricot in person. The bottom of the blouse is very tight and not loose like the pictures/description. It looks like a curtain drape that someone didn't know how to sew properly when I put it on. The blouse is see through. I'm disappointed with this blouse as I thought I'd really like it as much as I did in the pictures. I tried to like it but I just can't and it looks worse in person on me than it does in the pictures I attached. It isn't flattering at all. This is why I get discouraged with ordering clothing online because the product you receive often doesnt match what the seller says they're selling. I ordered a Medium and the top of the blouse especially near the waist and armpit area looks huge more like a large but the bottom near the hip area is snug unlike the pictures. I'm short and a little chubby after having children but I'm not huge or noticeably fat. This shirt makes me look like a balloon but the description says it does well to hide your belly and is good for plus size people. I'm not plus size but it sure makes me look like I am. If the bottom of the blouse was loose flowing like the description and pictures ordering a small might help but that's not the case.
1.0,Very disappointed in the product.
1.0,They don‚Äôt even fit my 14 month old. They came with a stain and bent roughly
1.0,too small. easily bendable. didn't like it.
1.0,This product locks nothing like what the model is wearing. Highly disappointed! This was suppose to be an anniversary gift.
1.0,broke after first use...and it was light use<br />worth couple dollars at that<br />it feels like a plastic bag attached to a handle
1.0,It doesn‚Äôt fit at all! Very crappy stuff. Edge is so rough you can be cut your finger by it. Never buy it. It delivered directly from China. Can‚Äôt believe how they sell this ugly stuffs. I wasted my time and effort to order.
1.0,This was either the one that was definitely not a medium or this was the one that was to big and I do believe it was the one that wasn‚Äôt a medium and it was more like a child‚Äôs small when I got it and the material was like costume material not knitted
1.0,"The product was tarnished and horrible. Couldn't even tell what color the metal was. So upset and disappointed I just threw them in the trash. Which with the qualify they‚Äôre made, that‚Äôs where they belong. GARBAGE!!"
1.0,This top runs super super small. Ordered an extra large and couldn't even get it over my head. So sad because it's adorable and a great price.
1.0,Didn't fit as they said.
1.0,"No, they did not look anything like the picture, very disappointed"
1.0,Well I bought it and the band broke - unfixable. Sent it back and ordered the same one again thinking it‚Äôs a fluke break - nope...2nd one broke in identifier spot.  There won‚Äôt be a 3rd time
1.0,These are cool and fit my son‚Äôs 11 year old hands perfectly! They seem a bit flimsy and I‚Äôm worried they may snap so I told him to be careful and not hit stuff with them.<br /><br />Update: he snapped one. 1 star now
1.0,"The product‚Äôs skin Is horrible, after laundry the It didn‚Äôt look the same, multiple small stuff started forming on the sleeves"
1.0,The w band fit my watch perfect. The problem I had was that I wear my watch on my left hand. The watch case made the scroll button way to sensitive and my watch was always going off while I did stuff.
1.0,Very loose not Tight
1.0,Followed directions explicitly. Still couldn‚Äôt get them to stick.
1.0,"Very disappointed by the quality and fit. Very thin material. Also, I ordered 1 size up (3x) just in case, but the size I got was a kids 14/16. How do I know? It fits my 8yr old daughter. Will not order from this seller again."
1.0,The skinny-ness of this band is cringe worthy. I‚Äôm slightly irritated I waited on a five day prime shipping turn around for a band that does not look like the picture. I don‚Äôt mind off brands - as my white one is such - but this one did not fit into the slot all the way. Will be returning.
1.0,Tarnished in the first HOUR. Save your money!
1.0,Great idea. However it's very flimsy and broke within 2 days.
1.0,Came apart at the seems first time wearing
1.0,Immediately falls off the Fitbit Versa 3 with any movement. We're sending them back.
1.0,The bracelet is very small it would not fit me my wife or any of my daughter's and my wife and daughter's have small wrist. When you wrap the bracelet to make it look like the picture it is to small. Bad buy.
1.0,They are very flimsy. They don't hold my one ear that is ripped up with my good ear.  Cheap I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"Sent cheaply made mask, not what was advertised."
1.0,The quality and appearance are terrible.  It was a very unpleasant experience when I opened the box.
1.0,Fitting is terrible.
1.0,"Every since we received our watch, we've tried setting it, but it didn't work, finally took it to a jewelry repair shop, to be told one of the dials don't work, which means it came broke, very disappointed."
1.0,I wear a size 12/14.  I ordered  XL/XXL.  They were SO small I didn't even attempt to put them on....I like to able to breathe!!!
1.0,They broke the second day they arrived. Very bad quality. They also look very cheap. Poor quality
1.0,"Backing broke off while bring removed from shipping card. Marked as Made in China, when the ad specifically said Made in USA."
1.0,Return to sm
1.0,"Was looking forward to wearing this shirt, but it was way too small at the waist!  Very disappointed.  How can an oversized shirt be too small?"
1.0,Terrible! Was received damaged! I‚Äôm returning.
1.0,I liked the price but this was extreme snail mail ordered Dec 7 and trceived it Jan 20 something almost last day was disapiibted in that but other than that it was okay
1.0,Not as long as described. Can't see it in the pic but it actually has an animal face in the spots. Not what I was looking for.
1.0,This belt broke within a week of normal wear. The metal ball point that goes into the belt holes snapped off
1.0,After wearing it for 3 days two stones fell out. Very poorly made. Will not be ordering here again.
1.0,The material of the pants is very cheap.
1.0,"This suit was not designed to fit any human body. the crisscross on the bottom if out in the right hip position bunches and makes a bulge in front :( The top has super weird length straps and is tight in weird places. Put in on, tried to adjust it to fit in any acceptable way, took it off and threw it away."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt like at all. First beside it taking weeks to arrive because of shipping issues when we finally received it the ‚Äúyeet‚Äù sound isn‚Äôt even clear. Sounds like a cheap toy from the dollar store. The boomer button is so much better and clear sounding.
1.0,"Not flattering, thin, and too big"
1.0,Broken after one minor use.
1.0,These shoes fell apart on the first wear. Do not waste your money. Very disappointing.
1.0,It doesn't fit at all.
1.0,"Terrible material, not at all able to be used as bathing suit. Waste of money and took forever to ship."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy it!!! The edges of the metal band can bend out, and I‚Äôve ruined lots of clothes because the sharp edges on the band will snag‚Ä¶EVERYTHING.  I‚Äôve bought similar style bands, and this was the only one that did this :("
1.0,"The sleeve of the shirt ripped after the second time wearing it. The fabric completely seperated from the rest of the shirt. Cheaply made, do not waste your money."
1.0,This product sucked! Couldn't even use the touchscreen feature and it was an uncomfortable fit
1.0,Colors aren't as bright. Print is blurry bad pixels for printing on the fabric. Shorts of the romper are too gathered and makes you look 10lbs heavier
1.0,i got 2 left feet boots. they are poorly made and will fall apart if i tried wearing them!
1.0,Requested refund. The color bleeds out after one wash (per printed wash instructions).
1.0,turns everything RED  i will never buy sunglasses from amazon again
1.0,Such an awkward shirt. Clearly cheaply made in China. The lace was started right above my belly button. Terrible boxy fitting shirt. Returned the shirt.
1.0,broke first time wearing it
1.0,This dress Looks adorable but is way too tight in the arms/chest area. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and 180 and I always wear XL but this XL was way too tight around my arms/chest/shoulders. It fit everywhere else though so a size up would be disproportionate.
1.0,"it is just a button, very cheap looking....not worth $5 much less $20"
1.0,Poorly made. Distorts images.
1.0,"Disappointed in this purchase... looks nice, but earring won't stay closed to stay in your ear, unless you are a mannequin with little to no movements in your day to day life.. not worth the money, if u can't wear them."
1.0,"Was so excited to receive this tank. Fresh out of the box, it looked fantastic, but that feeling would quickly fade as the day progressed. After a *single* wear, the screenprinted letters had horrible cracks and the shirt looked utterly terrible. By the end of the day, the letters looked as if it had been through a year too many wash cycles, but it hasn't even been washed! I don't know what kind of paint was used in this shirt, but there is no way it was made for this purpose judging by the fragility. I have never had a shirt do this and cannot wrap my mind around how quickly this deteriorated. Never would have spent $15 on a shirt had I known it would only last one wear.  Extremely disappointed to say the least."
1.0,"Very cheap fabric, not wearable as a dress , more of like a babydoll shirt . I returned it ."
1.0,Bought a 3x. It basically fit my daughter who is a ladies medium.
1.0,"Ordered Blue and white for my son's birthday, but their purple. Disappointed!"
1.0,Not true to size...order 2 sizes bigger....great fabric and nice tight fit...
1.0,Way too big!!!! I got an XS and I‚Äôm 105 5‚Äô2 and it was huge!! Looked like a medium-large
1.0,Maybe I just got a bad pair but one ripped and lasted only one day . While wearing them during working the ripped and fell off . Didn‚Äôt even have one to return . I‚Äôd like to have a replacement pair sent to me and try it again if the seller will send me a new pair .
1.0,These are probably the most uncomfortable pair of sweatpants that I have ever bought in my entire life. The material is cheap the colors aren't vibrant and they just
1.0,"Where they say ""Asian"" they mean to say these will not fit your fat American azz... i couldn't even get them over my crotch and i ordered three sizes larger than what I needed..."
1.0,No really good quality
1.0,"Took three weeks for the product to arrive. It‚Äôs made of a cheap, thin cotton material and I think unless you have some curves, this dress is very shapeless and the tied bow in front looks bulky and awkward. I didn‚Äôt like it, and the return process is just a huge hassle. I‚Äôm stuck keeping a dress that I don‚Äôt even like."
1.0,"They show a nice piece of PURPLE amethyst and they shipped one that was white and grey. I feel ripped off.Yes, I know amethyst varies in color, but NO purple is ridiculous!!"
1.0,I expect it to fit good but it doesn't the top of the dress is not a good fit.
1.0,Arrived ripped at the seam in front
1.0,"If you have big boobs, this cut of straps will push them down and make them looked smooshed - not cute cleavage. It's a great cut for a swimsuit in theory, but not for naturally large boobs. If yours are perky then let it ride, but just a warning for those who want to give this one-piece a shot."
1.0,Muy mala calidad<br />Se rayan con mucha facilidad y pueden el brillo
1.0,"Not what I expected, looks like old lady shirt, black is not faded like the pic, has no collar, has frilly material down the buttons, and took forever to get from China"

1.0,"I was so excited to recieve this dress, but when I finally got this dress in tbe mail, and I was extremely disappointed. The dress looked nothing like the pictures, the material and cut were not the same as what was displayed."
1.0,Gave me a bad rash behind my ears likely due to the fake gold...
1.0,"I bought this for a friend for her birthday. I saw her a couple days after she received it in the mail and the charm had already fallen off and it has already turned colors after only a couple days of wearing it. I know it isn't real silver or anything, but for 20 bucks I would have hoped it would have lasted longer than a few days!"
1.0,The pocket ripped first time I wore it.
1.0,"Turned my toe green the first day I wore one. They‚Äôre cute, but horrible quality."
1.0,THE QUALITY IS SO VERY POOR.  IT IS NOT LINEN AS DESCRIBED.  AND IT CAME REALLY SHORT
1.0,Bad quality not as expected super bad fabri I don't recommend
1.0,Very cheap.  Could not give as a gift. Gave to child for dress ups.
1.0,Garbage.  Don't waste your money they were loose and fell out of the glasses. Very disappointed. The only positive about these was getting my money back. Spend the money and buy real Oakley lenses and avoid the headache.
1.0,Small no very small
1.0,Quick release broke after day two. Not worth the money.
1.0,bad broken
1.0,"It hasn't even been 24 hours wearing this ring, and already the black has come out of the lettering<br />Very disappointed"
1.0,STOP !!!!  Your 15inch laptop will NEVER fit into this supposibily 15.6inch laptop bag. It is totallyü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•statements this vendor have made. Pertaining to this laptop bag.
1.0,"When I took the box out of the packaging and it looked like it was sized to hold children's shoes I knew it wouldn't be good.  I ordered a size 10.  These were like a size 8 1/2.  And comically narrow.  I have a medium width foot.  the foot bed was like 2 inches wide.  If you are a size 9 or above, don't even bother with these.  Any smaller sizes, order up at least a size and a half.  Also, these are cheap shoes.  Like the quality that hangs on the back wall of the shoe department at Target.  The kind you buy when something just happened to the shoes on your feet and you literally need shoes immediately.  That they think they can charge $100 for these shoes is shameful."
1.0,"I purchased these last week and they are already broken. The clamps are really hard to slide into place, and it was also painful to do it. It took about 5-6 minuets to do four of the six clamps because of the difficulty and time it takes. I must say for the short time that the clamps did stay in place, my shirt looked really nice. Unfortunately, if I bent down to pick something up or stretch the clamps more than the typically sitting standing, the the clamps that took so long to put it place easily came undone. I am a pilot and don‚Äôt do too much drastic movements when I work, but I had to fix the clamps a few times throughout the day, and consequently I had them for 5 days before 3 of 6 clamps broke, due to the immense time and fiddling it takes to get them to hold. I ordered another pair from another company that has actual clamps, would love to get a refund of my money, broke in 5 days."
1.0,Ordered my size exactly . Its a bit tight in the tips of my toes . But may stretch out due to the material .  Feels very flimsy and very soft/cheap . I tried it on once the faux leather is already super creased. This is the type of material that‚Äôs going to end up flaking if you wear it too much. Cute just won‚Äôt hold up I‚Äôm sure of it
1.0,The Velcro wasn‚Äôt sticking together about a week after we got them and ended up having to buy different shoes again so soon. Cheap light weight shoes. fabric and seems were not strong.
1.0,Way too big. Like really.
1.0,I bought this for a trip to Vegas. Was very dissapointed. It is cheap plastic and wouldn't make it through airport baggage handling. I kept it but only for car trips.
1.0,I opened the package and couldn't get them onto my head without the back latch detaching. I don't know how these would stay on my head. I returned them immediately.
1.0,They look good but they break so easily not worthy wasting money on it
1.0,Cleaned with soap and water and all the black came off... Not worth it
1.0,Was not the jacket in the picture... more like a shirt thin quality tshirt like and looks NOTHING like what I ordered... not the fit... not the color... not the style... DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,I have washed this jacket 2xs and its too itchy to wear. Donated.
1.0,Frabic is not what I expected also
1.0,"made from horrible material, painful on your feet. Not what I expected."
1.0,These glasses are cheap junk. When I put them on it left paint residue on my face and irritated my skin. I do not have sensitive skin so I have no idea what is wrong with these. When I discovered this I decided to rub the glasses on a piece of paper and the paint coating came right off leaving marks on the paper! I returned them immediately. Don't waste your money.
1.0,I ordered adult x-large! Way too small. Would barely fit my five year old Grandaughter!
1.0,I purchased another dress and this time it was way too long.  Had to tie it in knots at the bottom so I wouldn't trip over the damn thing
1.0,They do not glow at all.
1.0,Este producto lo regrese por que me quedo grande y todav√≠a no he recibido el otro
1.0,Wore this for a week and it will not stay clampped. It falls out all the time.
1.0,"I am in the 280s 5'9"" and got the 4x in the black and white polka dot with the red hearts. It was WAY too big. I had to have it hemmed because it hung so low as well. To my ankles. The worst part is the material. It's like swimsuit material. Super heavy and stretchy, seriously felt like a swimsuit top. I wore this for a New Years Eve party and as cute as it looked I didn't want anyone to touch me and feel it. I was extremely hot and uncomfortable all night. I'd honestly give this 0 stars if I could."
1.0,Not at all what is shown in the picture.
1.0,Waist too big. Compression short underneath also too big. Too loose to workout in. Length was also shorter than picture.
1.0,These were tissue thin and did not fit according to size.  Poorly made and returned them immediately once I opened the package
1.0,It's cute but stopped working a week after buying
1.0,Pretty meh product.  Doesn‚Äôt fit well arterial feel cheap and the nose wire is super thin ( imagaine a bread tie with the plastic stripped off
1.0,"The top is cute, but i cant wear it without the bottoms. I had 4 items in that shipment, and this item's bag was open and the briefs were missing :(<br />Very very angry"
1.0,I could barely get it to clasp because it was too small. This is usually where people say how much they would size up by but I honestly would not recommend that anyone should get this product. It is very cheaply made and the bra isn't even padded
1.0,"The fit was fine but i returned this dress because i was super disappointed in the quality.  The color was dull, almost faded looking.  And the fabric was so seriously thin that it was see through."
1.0,Hemline unfinished - started unraveling after the first wearing. Fabric thin. Will not purchase from this seller again.
1.0,Necklace only had 1 heart not 3
1.0,Posts were bent and the turtle was not a size for little girls....poor quality.
1.0,I have an event on Aug 14th and I ordered several pairs of these glasses. First one arrived-no batteries. So what good is it?
1.0,"Not at all. i thought that I was buying the grey version of the maroon one that I had previously purchased: full hand pocket, contrasting collar. Nope just a bait and switch. Very disappointed. Gave it away."
1.0,Fell twice wearing these shoes due to rubber sole<br />CAT SCAN<br />SCALP SUTETS
1.0,Receive today my reorder of these three tactical belts returned the first three for size inaccuracies of 51 in which not one of them measured correctly. We ordered the same three belts in the 55 in measurement only to find out that the measurements being used is not the actual size it's the overall length when doing the measurements inaccurate again. Even with allowing the 1 - 2 cm the belts do not measure up. Of the three belts brown gray and blue the brown overall length measured 55 inches the gray over all length measures 57 and 1/4 and the blue measures 58 and 1/4. The only belt that measures accurately once the belt is properly set up is the last one the blue one at 58 and a quarter inches. Once the open end of the belt is loop through the other half of the buckle the blue one is the only one that measures true 55 inches for a waist measurement. It's obvious these belts that I made in China do not have the stringent spec measurements we do in the United States. I've had this similar problem ordering this type of belt before from Amazon as well as eBay the measurements are without question very inaccurate even when including the margin of error which is indicated between 1 - 2 cm the belts still do not measure accurately. I would hope that Amazon will take this information and work with it to give there customers a much more accurate measurement system so that orders don't have to be returned and reordered again and again.
1.0,"I am a fan of Burberry, but I would not recommend buying their watches. I bought a similar Burberry watch as a gift for my mother at Neiman Marcus. The case and band have begun to corrode/rust. Both Neiman (and Burberry) have refused to help citing expiration of warranty and the fact that they don't carry that particular model anymore. They have directed me to contact Fossil for repairs, who is the manufacturer of the watch. Its disappointing to see a cheap watch is being sold by slapping a luxury label at a premium store."
1.0,I bought one of these jackets for my daughter.  The zipper on the pocket is defective and we had to cut the pocket to get her cell phone out. This company refuses to stand by their product and has TERRIBLE customer service.  They said they will not replace the jacket #1 because we cut the pocket and #2 because the jacket was manufactured 2 years ago.  We bought it new 3 months ago.  Nice product but not worth the price if they won't stand by their manufacturing.
1.0,I loved this top when I first got it but after wearing it one time it is all pilled and old looking. A real shame that is ready to be tossed in the trash since the styling is adorable
1.0,Not distressed looking or as oversized. Disappointed.
1.0,"Product was not new , looks like someone has worn it it was not as described product smelled like smoke with a bad odor"
1.0,I ordered these and I received pink hearts instead
1.0,TPU separates from the hard plastic all the time. I ended up getting an otterbox replacement because it was so annoying.
1.0,I received this rather quickly. The quality was garbage. Absolutely horrible. The material is very very very poor.
1.0,I ordered an XL but it is WAY too small - more like M at the very most.
1.0,"This would have been very cute, if it ever turned on."
1.0,Easily broken ‚òπÔ∏è
1.0,hated this necklace the paint chipped off in one day and now it‚Äôs just silver worst necklace I‚Äôve ever bought I really thought it was going to be better but it ended up being horrible please don‚Äôt waste your money on this it‚Äôs not worth it at all u might as well make your own it would be better than this necklace
1.0,"I expected these to be like a rear-view mirror -- to be able to see behind me.  Instead, it shows the ditch and the image is very distracting.  I asked several friends to try them, and they all said they were junk."
1.0,"This is advertised as a necklace & earrings.  Yet all I received was a portion of either the necklace, or a part of one earring.  The part that I received was decently made but I can't really do anything with it.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying this ""set"""
1.0,Only last for a few times of wearing.  Leather just tears from seams.  don't spend your money on them
1.0,"My daughter wore this bathing suit a total of 4 times and the entire top lacing came apart and the string to tie around her neck as well, so now this bathing suit is garbage."
1.0,"I really wanted to like this bra--it's such a cute design. I also found it fit true to size. But it's not very supportive. It LOOKS like it should be, with the wide elastic band, but it really isn't. The ""perfect lift, feel supported all day long"" promised by the tag isn't really working out. I also found after wearing it a couple times, the fabric is very itchy. Overall not a good choice."
1.0,Crappy quality. Said it was true to size but it def was not!!!! The color looks nothing like the picture and it was missing the string. I almost cried because I wasted my gift card on this!!! Very disapppointed!!!!
1.0,Product needed picture of the pink color offered. Color was not a ballet pink.
1.0,"Cheap socks, mine even came with a tear."
1.0,Much bigger and longer in length than picture shows.
1.0,"it has now starting to tarnish and the plating is coming off, showing whatever interior metal this is made of.it is DEFINITELY not sterling silver. I would return it except that the 30 day return window has closed"
1.0,It's not a face mask. Just s trimmed pair of pants
1.0,This watch band was pretty good but i ordered it in September and now it broke. I have not even worn it everyday since then and the clasp that holds it to watch fave broke.
1.0,"I am 5'7"" and this dress barely hangs below my ankles, the green color is totally misleading in the picture. I tried to return the item and they gave me a refund of about 5% for the dress. Waste of money, it sat in my closet until I donated it for nothing."
1.0,Came broken already
1.0,Very disappointed. I have to send it back now because It didn't comecwirh sequined top and it is huge! Don't order a size up. Shame on you for wasting my time!
1.0,Nice shirt but fell apart the first time I wore it. Buttons came off and pulls were all over it
1.0,"For all the curvy ladies, I bought a 2x- which should be a little big on me and this dress was SKIN TIGHT. Not flattering at all."
1.0,"Description says the earrings are 1.5 inches.  Silly me, I thought that meant the earrings themselves - not the earrings plus the hook.  The hook is 1 inch long.  The gears and casing (what I think of as the earring) is roughly 1/2 inch. Very small.  The gears show so clearly in this picture.  Not so with the earrings I received. The background is dark and much the same color as some of the gears so you can't see the gears very well.  Also, the gears shown in the picture are carefully and specifically placed.  The product I received has small gears stuffed into the casing in whatever way they would fit - like someone just dumped as much crap in there that they could and called it good.  I would really, really have loved these earrings if they had been what was presented in the picture."
1.0,Cute in the picture. Not cute on. Seems to run large
1.0,It broke !
1.0,My package came in and the skirt had a huge wet stain on it.  It will be going back
1.0,Not at all as advertised...very disappointing.
1.0,"Thankfully this waste of money was only 10 bucks.  The lenses are different color.  The tent is also not uniform on each lens.  So you will not enjoy looking through these shades, unless your color blind.  These are worse than factory seconds.  The left lens color is completely different from the right.  It will make you sick if you look through them too long.  I will leave the glasses for kids to play with and use the case for some good cheap drug store sun glasses."
1.0,Belt fit but already broke within a week
1.0,The chains keep bursting
1.0,Size is misleading.
1.0,This is supposed to be foldable. What a joke. This thing is so poorly put together. The braided strap around the hat is half braided on one side and falling off. It was packaged so poorly that the hat could never look like the picture - it is creased too much. It is made of paper. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Wasn't what<br />I thought it would be.
1.0,"I order a fuchsia scarf, the scarf I received is clearly purple, not even close to the picture showed to the fuchsia scarf"
1.0,"Buyer beware- these are not correct for M frame 2.0 as described - and there is a no return policy - I suggest looking elsewhere. Been an Oakley customer for 30+ years, and this experience surely pisses me off."
1.0,The noise broke as Soo‚Äôs as I put it on. Do not buy this product. Very poor quality.
1.0,Very tiny and plasticky!
1.0,"Bought this item as a gift and it was just opened. Very disappointed. It cannot hang on the wall as the brackets are uneven as well as the hooks. Also, where the hooks are placed is of poor quality."
1.0,This is a GREAT dissapointment!!! Both of the side clasps are loose so the bracelet can not be closed. What a waste of money!
1.0,These are absolute junk. The photos are very deceiving.
1.0,The fabric was not what expected. Didn't like it
1.0,Turned earlobes black after wearing for short time. Finish became gooey.
1.0,Frames to small
1.0,"Don‚Äôt waste your money waited 3 weeks for these. Tried on 4 pairs ripped them all. These are poor quality, save your money."
1.0,Very disappointed. The Lords Prayer is in Spanish.
1.0,MADE IN CHINA............
1.0,The underwire squeaked so much I had to cut it out of the bralette. Then the shape of it was destroyed. I should have just returned it.
1.0,Was smaller then I thought... Trying to return them..no luck
1.0,not ok
1.0,A small is size of large
1.0,Said it's a man's watch. More like a boys. Or for a girl
1.0,"Great jeans, but smaller than expected. Tried to size up based on consumer reviews, but jeans still fit smaller than I would have liked"
1.0,It was way way smaller than any 2x it was a strong  medium nothing larger
1.0,I received 2 identical pair of earrings instead of the 2 different pair pictured. Very Disappointed
1.0,"Not a good product.  It looked sturdy but wasn't.  After one wearing, a grommet fell out and now after three or four wearings more grommets are loosening and fabric is fraying.  The grommets are not aligned properly either.  A complete waste of money."
1.0,"Product was much too small! I picked a size UP from what I normally wear and still had to return it.  If fit too tightly in all the wrong places, inappropriate for work."
1.0,"Junk, hard to attach, then fell off and broke."
1.0,Broke first time wearing
1.0,arrived broken and bent
1.0,Does not feel soft and don't like the waist line too big.
1.0,Earrings way to heavy
1.0,"I ordered the green and it was more like seafoam/sage. Not sure why others said these were comfortable. If you want to wear a potato sack made of rough burlap, then sure they are comfortable. It's like they attempted to be linen material. The sizing was a little small for a medium, similar to Forever 21 sizing for juniors. I know the price is cheap but I wanted shorts that were actually comfortable for lounging and the material wasn't something that worked for me. Returned."
1.0,Not good washes so easily. Please don't waste your money
1.0,Cheaply made! I really wanted to love this dress but it arrived with a hole in it!
1.0,Worse quality ever
1.0,"way to small, Asia and US sizes very different."
1.0,Was expecting more in terms of quality. Not impressed at all ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
1.0,So much bigger than a standard face mask.
1.0,Wrong lanyard delivered. Not even a snap jewelry lanyard. So disappointed.
1.0,I usually wear a small. I ordered a medium product way too small.
1.0,Horrible. This sword is literally the size for an infant. This is NOT at all what I expected and I am very disappointed. Bought for a gift and I cannot at all present this to a little kid. Unsatisfactory!
1.0,About 3-4 sizes to small
1.0,Worst. Quality. Ever.
1.0,shrinks very easy
1.0,"The material wasn‚Äôt as expected n I couldn‚Äôt ware it, plus they sent me 4 of these‚Ä¶.I sent the back, returned n waiting on my refund‚Ä¶. Thx Kimi"
1.0,This scarf looks terrible!  It looks like they cut off the bottom of a cheap cotton dress and tried to pass if off as a scarf.  They didn't even try to sew a seam on it to keep if from raveling. They just chopped it off and shipped it out.  Bought this as an xmas gift but was too embarrassed about the cheap quality of it to give it to my co worker.
1.0,Normally stuff from king Size is pretty good. This is not. The leather is paper thin and peels and tears from just wearing it. I've worn it maybe eight times in a month and its peeling in multiple places. i wore it to restaurants and just out walking with my wife so no reason for this kind of wear and tear. In addition. the zipper gets stuck nearly every time I put it on. Also the left pocket has a tear in the material and I never even put anything in there! Really poor quality. Requested a refund.
1.0,"Didn't look like it would last one rodeo. I returned it. The original charge for this item was $91. , including tax. They refunded only $77. , including tax. Don't  buy, especially from Ranch & Home."
1.0,"Ordered extra large knowing I have large but not gigantic calves, received a child‚Äôs sized small leg warmer.<br /><br />Literally had a hard time getting these over my feet.<br /><br />No, don‚Äôt buy-unless of course you have unusually small calves."
1.0,"I have to revise my post because you can only leave feedback for all the dresses even if the dresses you purchase are not the same one.  That's just stupid.  WARNING: The dresses are not made the same.<br /><br />I purchased 3 dress and all were made differently;<br /><br />1. Navy (Navy with printed pattern):  Very nice dress, WITH POCKETS.  Waist in front is a piece of same material, waist in back is elastic.  Flowy weighted material.  I would give this one 4 stars.  So I purchase another in another color.<br /><br />2. White_black (White dress with black Moroccan prints):  Made like Navy dress with elastic only in back BUT NO POCKETS!  Lighter weighted material, thin, not the same quality.  I would give this 3 stars. Overall not too bad, I will keep it.<br /><br />3. Grey (Large Blue Tropical Leaves with Reddish floral-Tropical print): 1 STAR.  NOT LIKE the OTHERS AT ALL.  I was very excited to get this one.  I love the print but when I received it, it was crap.  Very light thin material.  Very flimsy 5 inch elastic around the entire waist of dress narrowly trying to hold the dress together to give it shape but it's just a big MooMoo with loose elastic for the waist.  NO POCKETS as pictured.  As you can see this is the 1 Star because dress is not as the other dresses and not as pictured.<br /><br />I can see now what there are different opinions on these dresses.  It is because the dresses are not made the same."
1.0,"When it arrived, I was so shocked at how much they looked like a prize from a little toy dispenser, the sort you'd get in a plastic egg for a quarter. Terrible! Will NOT buy again."
1.0,Seem as it was returned by someone else then sent to me .it wouldn‚Äôt stay zipped. No tag attached and button was mess up. But it did look just like the picture upset I couldn‚Äôt wear it
1.0,"Cute pajamas, but the Women‚Äôs Medium is more like an extra small!"
1.0,"This anklet is no good, soon as opened it to try on the clasp broke! Not worth your time."
1.0,"very thin, small and cheaply made."
1.0,"These didn't make it through one full season. After a few washes the fleece lining pilled to the point that they are A: no longer warm, and B: they are no longer opaque and now have a mottled pattern that looks ridiculous. I inquired about returning them and the company shut me down because I was outside the 30 day return policy. My $7 drugstore pairs that were identical have held up. Save your money."
1.0,"Bought two of these watches. The second after the first died after the return window closed on it! Now the 2nd has gone to watch heaven as well. Again a week after the return window closed. This watch draws lots of comments. Its design is interesting. Its price is right. Too bad its mechanics are so bad that if you get more than a month life from it, consider yourself lucky. If it actually worked, I'd buy it at twice the price. As it is now, its a ripoff."
1.0,Less than a month and it's already turned colors. Very upset about this as it was well taken care of. This was supposed to be a special gift but now she can't even wear it. Very very disappointed.
1.0,"These are not sterling silver, they are tarnished in just 2 weeks.  Total rip off. Don't say  something and its false. Orange everywhere."
1.0,DO NOT PURCHASE!! It was nothing of what the picture shows or description. Not even made properly nor was it sized correctly to be worn as a dress.
1.0,Loved it ! Wish I could get it on
1.0,Great fit wrong color.
1.0,"You could totally see your eyes through the lenses, they were light weight and felt cheap"
1.0,It's a 3X and looks like a ladies large. I kept it as it costs half the price of the swimsuit to ship it back. Disappointed.
1.0,The bill of the hat is flimsy
1.0,had them stretched to fit at shoe maker
1.0,It‚Äôs pretty but completely dysfunctional. It constantly slides and is much too long.
1.0,"I purchased this for my husband as a birthday gift which he was happy to receive..,after wearing it for 5 days the diamonds fell out ..I‚Äôm very disappointed with it and wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone..."
1.0,It only came with the kimono not the full thing not worth the money
1.0,Way to tight around ankles could not ware them gave them away to goodwill
1.0,"I bought this band for my wife. We loved the idea of a slim band similar to the stock Apple one. We used it for about a week. The clasp broke randomly and her watch fell off and hit the floor. I want to say this is a factory defect, but just wanted to put it out there. I would be willing to take this review back if we could get another one and it later for longer than two weeks. Sorry but it broke out of nowhere."
1.0,Fell apart in the package! Cheaply Made in China! Really horrible quality.
1.0,Dye finish was terrible came off all over my wife and bed.
1.0,The size was perfect. The stone and diamonds fell out out the ring within a week. It's too bad because it was very beautiful
1.0,Faded almost immediately.  Very disappointed..
1.0,This run super small. Had to return them
1.0,The strips are short for adults.
1.0,The quality could be better. Love the style.
1.0,"Cheaper made materials, i guest u get what u paid for at this point. Was my first time trying this company."
1.0,I am returning this watch. Face is too small. More like a child watch than for a man
1.0,"El aro esta disparejo,""parace una tuberia picada"",sin trabajarla"
1.0,The part where it opens is SO LOOSE I cant put this pin on anything because it just flaps around
1.0,Terrible. Really bad pants. People would laugh at you for wearing these. Shame on the seller for wasting my time with this garbage.
1.0,I buy clothes from Amazon at all times. This is the worst I‚Äôve received. The ribbon frays from the beginning and the fabric is less than desirable. Very disappointed because it took forever to receive.
1.0,"Cheaply made! I'll fitting, poor material. No label inside. Same product sold<br />From China for way cheaper on Wish/other sites!"
1.0,Frame broke at the narrow section under the left lens when I pushed them up on my head.  Various types of glue failed to repair.  I replaced with a lens style that is open under the lens and they have been great.
1.0,"I typically love this brand of leggings, but for being ‚Äúsquat-proof‚Äù they literally ripped a hole in the stitching the first time I wore them! Not the same quality of material I‚Äôm used to with 90 DBR, so I was very disappointed and felt like I wasted my money on these."
1.0,"I have an apple shape, gain weight in my middle. I recently lost 30 lb (am now 5‚Äô4, 160 lb). These were way too tight/snug around my waist and were not flattering to the FUPA. Will be returning. They were snug in the waist, loose on the legs."
1.0,"I like the style, it is just way to small and sense it is from China, I could not return it.  I did receive a 10% discount."
1.0,There is a small piece of design cloth on the should blades which is not seen on the pictures but after receiving the product it looks rather odd. Wanted to return it but wanted to save the headache of spending more money on postage charges than the price of the product I kept it. I am a person with a small torso and it is still even smaller for me just shy of touching my belly button. Tall people please avoid this blouse.
1.0,"Whatever you do, don't buy this bag. It looks really nice and seems to have everything you need in a duffle bag, but one tug on the zipper and boom you see how cheap this piece of crap really is. Zippers lasted one full pull before falling off. It's made cheap and awful. Beyond disappointed with this thing will never order from this seller or store again."
1.0,All the black hair and eyebrows rubbed off in my hand as I was unpacking.  Had to color in the mask with a black marker.
1.0,"Weatherproof Yes,  when I'm on the phone I just keep hitting buttons,  and the fingerprint touch does not work  it's iffy."
1.0,"I tried this on and immediatly took it off.  There is no support and its not easy to maneuver or tie in an effort to get it to stay in place.  On top of that, it hurts to take off.  For reference, I'm a 34D."
1.0,"It snap and separated the moment I put on, poorest quality ever.<br />It appeared home made because there is no secure connection but only a tape."
1.0,Super cheaply made.
1.0,Color was ugly.  Not what it looked like in picture
1.0,not even two months and one of the numbers no longer lights up
1.0,Worst blisters from socks in 3 years. Not made for long distance running
1.0,"Horrible, I would NOT recommend! First I ordered a large and an XL in this as I have a big top and small bottom so I never know what will work best.<br />The bottoms are SEE THROUGH and have ZERO LINING!<br />Then the top, couldn't even try it in as I pulled it out of the package and even the XL would not fit bigger than a size""A"" cup...definitely NOT a large or XL. It might fit an 11 year old who is just finallydeveloping, but the bottoms are HUGE! What a cheap mess...look else where"
1.0,It faded after only 1 wash.  So Sad.. I love Carmen SanDiego. I purchased 14 shirts at the same time and it is the only one to fade after 1 wash.
1.0,"WOW. where to begin. 1 I got an XL, which was generous as I wear a medium, to say this was small is an understatement. The measurements are completely off, the dress is NOT at all stretchy, the back of the dress is solid blue. 2. to return you have to pay 3.99 meaning I would only get back 2.99 of the price I paid. BEWARE returns are not free. Additionally, the material smells so bad and is such crappy quality."
1.0,This jumpsuit material is to thick and doesn‚Äôt have the top layover like pictured so I returned it.
1.0,It was cute but skirt part was messed up disappointing. :(
1.0,They TURN YOUR FINGERS GREEN.Do not recommend these
1.0,Too tight  uncomfortable.. can't wear it!!
1.0,I wear a 1x. I ordered a 2x and couldn't get this over my head.  This is a medium.  Waste of money. The quality is HORRIBLE.  IT looks nothing like the picture.  Lace is cheap looking and it is poorly sown together.
1.0,These never stayed up and then the wire broke off the back
1.0,Hate this shirt so much I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm capable of articulating how much I despise it. Plus it runs super big in size and the material is absolute garbage as I said before. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!
1.0,Watch band broke the first day.
1.0,"Cheap. Arrived 4 days late and the inside of the ring is a misprint. Says ""Il ovey ou"". I do not recommend."
1.0,"These are cute but the discription is inaccurate. It says it is a fully fibboned hair clip however, the bottom portion is the clip is exposed and NOT covered with ribbon. Can very easily snag or scratch children's scalps. Yes they are cute and seem to be of good quality but was disappointed to be mislead and. Or have the entire clip covered."
1.0,"The suit size would be OK but the band's don't expand so there's no way to get into it! I sold it to a friend who is 2 sizes smaller and it for her, bands just a bit snug for her as well. Price is good and it looks nice."
1.0,"First order was lost in shipping, ordered again and stated it would arrive around 09-23 however when I checked the mail it was delivered today. Image on the shirt isn't centered and obviously made in someone's personal garage using cheap faded out looking Fruit of The Loom shirts.  Totally unacceptable and Amazon should be ashamed to allow such bad quality on their site. This is something that should only be sold on Craigslist or Itsy.  I will be asking for a full refund."
1.0,The color faded within 1 week and the strap that held the excess band broke early on!
1.0,The tape and packing look fine as the description shows but tape does not work and does not support anything. It just rolls down.
1.0,This crap does not fit without cutting which will ruin the look and feel of the band. What a waste of money!!!
1.0,"The bells fall off very easily. In three weeks of wearing it, I only have 4 bells left."
1.0,False advertisement. Very cheap plastic purse that costs ~ $5. Perhaps good for recycling.
1.0,Fell apart after less than 2 months.  Very disappointed.
1.0,It was a cheap product and it looks and feels cheap
1.0,I had ordered this dress to wear out on a date during the summer. Sadly when I opened the package I opened it to it smelling like glue. It did not fit the way it was described. I would not recommend
1.0,Dress was tiny- returned
1.0,Quality of material not good badly sewn together and the size ordered was too small the seller wanted me to pay for return half of what the dress cost
1.0,I only received 1 pair of shorts
1.0,Both shoes fell apart on the sides the very first day of wearing them. Very poor quality - the white part is glued to the sides so these can easily come apart from very little wear.  Would NOT recommend.
1.0,muy cortas
1.0,Was nothing like picture different style and color. Very disappointed  Was short and not a sweater at all
1.0,"Material was nice, but unfortunately they d it d not stay in place. Would not recommend"
1.0,Pants ran  small. I got in them but they busted open when I sat down.
1.0,"I got this for 19.99$ from original listing price as 99.99 $. But now the Original listing price is 66.66$ that could not be true. You can change the discount price , but how come original listing price differs?  I loose trust in buying these products, it make me to think that i m wasting money on cheap products by false marketing."
1.0,Broke after just a few uses breaking at the hinges
1.0,Joke!!! Thin like pantyhose!!!
1.0,Too thin and rough fabric.  I returned them.
1.0,The necklace I received looked nothing like the one pictures here. The one I got looked more like dog tags than the cute cut out looking skull pictured. Not happy with it at all.
1.0,Stich quality was not good. It has multiple holes near the stich areas..now I have to pay more for fixing these holes..hence will be returning.
1.0,I should have read the reviews before purchasing. There is no actual feathers on the wings just printed on. They were folded in the package so they are misshaped. We thought they were longer wings too. If it wasn‚Äôt so close to Halloween we would have returned them.
1.0,"This necklace is super cheap.  It looks like plastic.  Unfortunately, there was only a one month window to return as well."
1.0,Definitely doesn't worth the money.  The picture is so deceiving. I will return.
1.0,"The red part disintegrated after 2 months of wear!!! First one ball fell off, but left the ""metal screw"" part still attached to the black horseshoe. I figured, eh, they break sometimes. Happens.<br />Went to unscrew the second ball to change the earring and it fell off at the touch. It was eaten away where it had been touching my skin! I only clean my piercings with water and wear ear coverings when I dye my hair so no chemicals came into contact with it. If prolonged contact with skin can destroy it like that in a matter of weeks it should NOT go anywhere near an ear. I had to cut the black horseshoe part with pliers to get it out since the small metal screw pieces that had been inside the balls were too small to screw off.<br />I have high quality photos of this but there's no options to post a picture with a review... probably because this happens a lot"
1.0,I wish I could leave less than one star. Bought an XL and it looked like it would fit a 12 year old. Tried it on anyways since it wasn't for public wear and the stitching came undone immediately. Absolutely horrible. This company should be banned from selling.
1.0,Quite poor looking
1.0,OMG this is for a female!!!!!
1.0,Horrible! It's not even made my alpine star it's just a regular &#34;fruit of the loom&#34; t-shirt with a press on alpine star logo only on the front (which was put on crooked) and not even on the sleave as pictured... very disappointed. Don't waste your money.
1.0,This pic makes it look sexy and let me tell you it's anything but. The feel of the material is rough and scratchy. It even has shoulder pads . . .I haven't seen shoulder pads since the 90's. The shirt was huge and not cute at all in person. I returned.
1.0,The material was starting to reap
1.0,"In a decent fabric, this dress would be lovely. As it, it's like cheap workout fabric. There is absolutely no structure, so the bodice does not stand up. The cool pointy bit folds over.<br /><br />Because I'm too lazy to return it, it will make an okay beach/pool cover up."
1.0,They look ok my issues are the large hoop has a very noticeable seam the closure rings that hold the dangled part on the main hoop on most pieces are overlapped and not closed in a nicely manor the larger hoops are a bit heavier then expected and the closing of the hoops are not very easy to close so definatly not at all what I expected quite a bit disappointed üòû.
1.0,"The post backs are so difficult to attach and wear, To tiny and flimsy was hoping for better . I did not return them just not worth he bother. lost one the first day wearing"
1.0,Disappointed ordered my size but the shoe just too small.
1.0,Beautiful but sized incorrectly. Looks like a size 12-14üòè
1.0,Supposed to be 3X seemed more like XL.  Instead of wasting postage gave toa friend.
1.0,The product is cheap and doesn‚Äôt lay flat. It‚Äôs beading on top of felt. Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,"It does not help slim you whatsoever and it rolls down when you sit it is terrible. I thought maybe I got a size too small so I reordered and got a largest size, same thing doesn't help you slim whatsoever and it rolls down when you sit."
1.0,Girl hat
1.0,"The slacks fit great., along with the best. Three jacket was about three sizes too small."
1.0,The skirt runs too<br />It had to be returned
1.0,"Total junk, they fell off both shoes in less than a day."
1.0,This item has proved to be no more than brass dipped in sterling silver at the very least. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I am usually a small, bought a medium in case, was still took small so I returned it."
1.0,This is not what I ordered. The sunglasses I ordered were pink frames.
1.0,"This key chain arrived mint, appeared as solid quality, but lo and behold in less than two weeks in use the leather strap came off."
1.0,The bottoms were very saggy!
1.0,"The product description is misleading. The chain is gold PLATED, rather than gold filled. It deteriorated within a month, and I take very good care of it. Do not buy, unless it is for a one time use."
1.0,Cheap ass glasses! So fake and crappy.
1.0,"The bracelet looks nice, stainless steel is good.  However the clasp does not hold it securely shut.  The Bracelet could fall off too easy & the safety info would be lost, along with a life.  :("
1.0,Both sides of the mask ripped on very first use. The elastic for ear loops is very poorly stitched together and came apart on intial use. Material is soft but thick over nose.
1.0,Very thin and had a hole in back of shoulder . Refund was easy with no problems.
1.0,I thought I was buying an Adidas track suit.  Cheap made in China track suit
1.0,Let's start off by saying this was NOT like the picture. The material literally feels like a soccer worn by a goalie. The material is scratchy and none breathable. The neck does not fit like the picture. I also sized up to a XL and the shorts looked like a S to M. This whole outfit is a JOKE!!!!
1.0,"It does not look like it does in the picture. There isn't a long, tassled side of the scarf to circle around you. It's a regular, black, tight knit scarf with tassled ends. And the ends are short, you can't get the effect that the picture shows.  I bought it for that rainfall tassle, boho effect. It looks nothing like that. Not worth it."
1.0,It is very beautiful but very thin and breaks easily we have fix it 2 time  until we give up<br />Can not recommend
1.0,Very misleading product description.  The shoe is only available in a Size 6!  Returned it.
1.0,"This was not what I expected.  High waisted, yes but no tummy control. Every roll and panty line shows.  Definitely not worth the price."
1.0,Package came mangled totally unhappy about everything
1.0,I loved the dress but it ran small so
1.0,Cheap material and not what I wanted.
1.0,This was so tiny it feels like it should be a US size 8 even though I purchased a XL/XXL. Returning.
1.0,"The suit was made of low quality material and I don't expect it will last very long.  The headband streached out after the first use and it was not tight at all.  It is cute, but not worth your money!"
1.0,Did not like this cheap material at all
1.0,***EDIT*** I contacted the company and they sent me a new band. I will report back after I've worn it for a while.***<br />I've had this for two days and it has already broken. One of the pins that hold the clasp together popped out. Save your money.
1.0,"I thought it was going to be a darker color, but it is a pale pink/lavender color."
1.0,"Hips, rear and thighs way to slim for 2XL. If you are on the huskier side and usually wear 2XL look elsewhere."
1.0,To small hard to close
1.0,"These earrings are gorgeous, but I purchased them for a big event and they are so cheaply made that one actually fell off onstage. A massive disappointment."
1.0,"Very small. I ordered Medium (32-35). I usually wear 34 waist, but could not even come close to getting them on. I'd be surprised if they are 31&#34; waist.<br /><br />No return label or postage paid.<br /><br />Not recommended."
1.0,they dont stay in at all. it doesnt screw in- u just press it in.
1.0,I only received one shoe in package. Only received the left foot
1.0,"Extremely flimsey, and doesn't hold shape.  Could not get the earring to clasp, ended up bending all out of shape, can't wear them now.  Don't bother!"
1.0,Horrible horrible quality. I took it out of the bag to put it on my silver necklace and it broke. Do not buy!
1.0,Buckle kept slipping out of connection to leather!  Poor product buckle should be sewn in
1.0,Horrible. The back rides up constantly and pushes. I get they put that opening in the back so you could use the bathroom easily but they should have made snaps at the bottom instead. It would have been great except for that. Once it starts sliding up you could easily tell on the outside of your clothes that you‚Äôre wearing something.
1.0,"Not fleece, very thin material and like everything else lately size chart measurements and true size are way off. Better buy 2-3 sizes bigger than you normally wear."
1.0,Dress came with stains on it which is frustrating but I did try it on and will be using it as a pajama dress. I would have loved this dress had it not been stained (ruined) prior to me receiving.
1.0,i purchased the largest size they had a 4x .  I weigh 150 lbs and wear a 10-12 normally ..
1.0,"I ordered an XL but it fits like a small. Sizing is waaaay off. I usually wear a large, can wear a medium (but tight) but ordered up and I couldn't even pull this on over my shoulders. It's so pretty but my goodness is it small. Smallest XL I have ever seen. Maybe a child's XL? Maybe they missed sized it? For less then $10, I'm not returning it, giving it to my SIL, my very tiny SIL."
1.0,It was to small for my face.
1.0,Didn't fit!.
1.0,The size was too small doesnt overlap without twisting up.
1.0,Garbage. The sides ripped right away. You get what you paid for...
1.0,"The fabric is nice but i prefer medium or large in jackets‚Ä¶and I got a large and it looks like a small. It also looks like a small on me and a little tight. I like my jacket loose and free to move around in. Sadly returning this. If I decide to order this again, I know that a large won‚Äôt do any good for me so I would have to order XL."
1.0,Terrible collar that rolls in while wearing
1.0,"Purchased a large as I was scared it wasn't going to fit. However, the dress was extremely wide and the top portion didn‚Äôt sit well on the chest area. Plus the material was thin not for going out but to wear as a nightgown. I sent mine back because I was never going to wear it."
1.0,poor material and to small
1.0,Broke the first time used. Returned after waiting over 2 weeks to receive
1.0,"Wanted to love it, but should have expected the poor quality based on the price.  This is made of the thinnest knit, and complete see through.  It is same quality as the T-shirts they sell in the bahamas for 5 for $10.  If you know what that is like, expect the same here."
1.0,"The watch had a beautiful look, but does not work as a watch."
1.0,"The cardigan took well over a month to ship, while us was attractive fabric quite thin- have returned the item and am still waiting on my refund"
1.0,1 glove came bigger than the other. I couldn‚Äôt even fit one on my other hand without cutting it down the side.
1.0,"The pants are fine but in one regard. The left cargo pocket did not have the bottom of the pocket sewn into the pants, which led to a fun game of find my car keys. Somewhere in quality control this slipped. I have no complaints about the rest of it, but now i have to sew my new pair of pants. Beware"
1.0,Looked like a lone potato in a sack. The material was also very thin and cheap. Ended up returning.
1.0,Nice but to large
1.0,The hat came all wrinkled and unsalvageable.  I ended up throwing it away as there was no way to reshape it.
1.0,Will no keep a person warm
1.0,Really hoped this would work for swim exercises!<br />The top fit but the leg holes were huge!<br />I ordered 12-14 but 2 xl came!ü•¥
1.0,"Find these pants somewhere, else. Customer service here ..... need I say, more."
1.0,I ordered a 2x according to the chart. It's cut more like a U.S. medium.<br />Not certain the 4x would even fit.<br />Shipping took FOREVER<br />Highly disappointed!!
1.0,It is cheaply made and I don't like it at all.
1.0,"I returned this. I did not like that  the batteries were separate, and I would‚Äôve had to install them myself. I also did not like the overall look of the product"
1.0,"ear wire snapped off of earring first time putting on. Sent both back. They are cute for the price, however, you get what you pay for."
1.0,This dress came not as pictured. 1: the color was supposed to be navy blue..instead it was a grayish blue. 2. The waistline was almost up by the boob area! NEVER AGAIN! Ever
1.0,It feels like there‚Äôs lens grade. I feel dizzy eveytime i use it.
1.0,While the shirt is super cute it shows bra straps through the net and pasties or bras underneath.
1.0,Don't buy this!
1.0,"Probably would have worked, except that it didn't fit my face. Probably would have worked better if I actually had seeing eye glasses on underneath them. I don't, so they didn't work out"
1.0,"I would not recommend this product. It looks like it‚Äôs for a newborn baby... maybe up to a 12 month old... but, even that‚Äôs pushing it. My 5 and 8 year olds are the ones who watch Funneh and the Krew on YouTube. I don‚Äôt think I know a single newborn that watches and wants to buy their merch.  ;)  I totally would of returned it but my daughter is going to keep it and use it for her American Girl dolls."
1.0,"The part that attaches the key holder ring to the key chain fob broke within 4 days, it pulled out and is not something that could be screwed back in."
1.0,This cloth couldn't clean my silvered ring.it was just a waste of money.Don't waste your breath on it.
1.0,It broke the first time i wore it. I basically wasted my money.
1.0,"I have a short torso as I am under 5'1&#34; and the suit torso length is too short.  The bra lining fits at my waist so it is uncomfortable.  Some of my swim buddies have the same suit, they are taller than me, and do not have the same problem.  I should have sent it back to exchange, but did not realize it didn't fit well until I wore it into the pool."
1.0,"Fabric is thin, and it pills after one use. Also they're not very tall...going only 6 inches from ankle to top."
1.0,Not happy product is missing nose peice. My daughter was extremely upset.
1.0,"Really not flattering. Itchy, scratchy mesh sections. Band around the middle isn't tight. The back design is pretty, and it comes with padding, but not much else positive to say."
1.0,Too small. Ordered another and went size up and still to small.
1.0,It broke right when I put it on.
1.0,"this is the second watch that I received.  The first watch the band was broken in the box.  So i ordered another one, I received the watch yesterday I wore it for 4 hours and the band broke on the buckle side.  I want to get another watch I really like this watch, but of the bands are always going to be a problem I might not want one."
1.0,This romper fits way too small. I usually wear a large but this large fit me like small.
1.0,"Poorly madequate, broke the first time I put it on!"
1.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap! Not deserving of even one star!"
1.0,"I received a ""brand new"" tank top that already has deodorant spots on it because it was already used....<br />I bought another one in a different color and it had tags whereas this one did not."
1.0,I gave this to my husband for Christmas. He wore it that day and by dinner time the number patch on the arm was fraying and peeling off. We were goin* to use fabric glue to repair it when we noticed the Indian face patch was peeling off. Decided to return it because it should not be falling apart after a few hours of wear. It would probably disintegrate if washed!
1.0,"The product is huge, to big to fit in my ear.  Quality is poor."
1.0,Is a nice design shirt . I just really dont like how small it is .Maybe they should make it in bigger sizes .
1.0,"Impossible to even get in my nose, plus it isn't subtle--looks cheap. Don't buy"
1.0,The watch band is fine but both of the holder loops broke within a few weeks of wearing the band.  The quality of those loops is not first rate.
1.0,"High impact my rear end. The straps were too long. Maybe if you have small or enhanced breasts this would work. But for this real, large bosomed gal, I need more support."
1.0,"Clearly an issue with the stitching, super disappointing"
1.0,Disappointing. Fit funny. In a cheapy Chinese boxy way. Unflattering.  The material is also flimsy synthetic and wrinkles easily.  Returned this.
1.0,Does not help at all
1.0,Very disappointed as soon as I put them on they were peeling off
1.0,"The picture looks bright and vibrant, but the actual scarf had dull colors. I tried to take a picture of it to show a friend, and the picture I took also showed bright colors. I do not blame the manufacturer, since it appears to be a trick of the camera, but the pictures are not representative of the actual product you receive."
1.0,What did I expect? right?  just say no to 2 or 3 dollar jewelry
1.0,The ring is cute but turned black within a month.
1.0,"Got this hoping it would be large enough to wear with leggings, it was smaller than expected but could still look cute with jeans. I loved the color and the coziness of the material however there was a huge hole in the shoulder that i noticed while it was still in its packaging. Highly disappointed in the quality and that I didn't even get the chance to wear it. Will be returning asap!!!"
1.0,Shrunk a lot when washed
1.0,The knobs and screw bar is very very tight . I had to use a pair of pliers in order to twist . Will not recommend this product to any one . Also it does not fit for wide feet .Do not buy it and waste your money . I had to return it .
1.0,Too biggest
1.0,cheap material. tore with one wash
1.0,Ball fell off in four days.  Piece of garbage
1.0,It broke and the red faded on the roses literally after 3 Days wouldn‚Äôt recommend
1.0,Very disappointed with this dress. It's really poorly made. 1 wash and threads coming out everywhere .  Pretty colors and I don't mind that it's see through as it was worn over onesie and tights but just very amateur job on it.
1.0,falling apart & coming unraveled . The loop stitching in the terrycloth is coming undone. Along with the inseam bonding stitch in the inside has come undone on a couple
1.0,I got this and washed it before wearing it and it fuzzed out really bad and I never got the chance to wear it as it looks like it was worn 100 times.
1.0,Broke  when I tried  it on
1.0,Came like this üòí
1.0,I actually returned this too. Was way too big and sis not like the way it fit.

1.0,Did not last 3 days. The leather ribbon on the handles are now broken and coming apart. Barely worn.
1.0,falling apart in bag. returned.
1.0,"DOEs not look like the picture. Showed up looking like I bought it out of the quarter machine. Straight in the garbage it went, never even wore it."
1.0,"too small , said large was more like a small and the top was stiff and like an extra small"
1.0,Too small and unreturnable
1.0,Not as described. I was sent flowers instead of the dress.
1.0,These boots are at least a full size smaller than the posted size. And if they are too small you will have to pay to ship them back! Not happy.
1.0,Poorly made and cheap material.
1.0,Waste of money don't buy ..
1.0,Very dark. Not the color shown.
1.0,"Very small, the inside doesn't open to slip a picture in, so it seems like I'll just have to glue it. After opening the locket, I am completely unable to close it."
1.0,This is made of weird non-stretchy material and is absolutely not capris. Also too small and not flattering with very long stride.
1.0,"(Writing review on husbands prime account) There was something GLUED to the front of the shirt I was delivered. :( I was extremely upset since when I purchased the shirt it was back ordered so I had to wait more than two weeks just to get a ruined shirt!<br /><br />Updated: I got it replaced with a new sweater and I‚Äôve noticed that it snags on jewelry, Velcro, etc. And it rips the strings out easily. :/. Kinda disappointing."
1.0,These shoes hurt my arch and actually caused planter fasciitis.
1.0,Earrings came broken. Delivery package not damaged.
1.0,Didn't fit well. did not stretch and the fabric is thin.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt receive the product don‚Äôt recommend buying this item at all
1.0,It was a very pretty looking bracelet. Fake jade and easily scattered. Waste of money.
1.0,Why are the wire as hanging out of the shoe? How do i get them inside? I know shes not supposed to wear them like that
1.0,Stiff and poor quality.
1.0,"This poncho was advertised as Realtree Camo Max-4 (brown), but the poncho I received was Realtree Camo Xtra (green).  Wrong color.  So I will send it back."
1.0,"For starters this men's shirt is a woman's.  As soon as you hold it up you can tell right away that it's cut for a woman's shape.  The size is also way too small-- but again if you're looking for a woman's medium than it fits but as a men's medium its more like a XS.  They even included a free headband-- it was bright pink.  It's also not a compression shirt, just a stretchy style one.  Fabric was very cheap. Sent it back for a refund and ordered one from a different company."
1.0,My friend recommended this brand to me since it was allegedly similar to the Align pants from Lulu Lemon. What I received was a cheap pair or poorly made and poorly sized leggings that I even feel bad donating they‚Äôre THAT BAD. Something happened where the seller changed and this quality is no longer what it used to be. I‚Äôm just thankful I only ordered 1 pair and hope I can return it.
1.0,"I bought this shoes for my son birthday one of the shoes didn't work.now I can't return it back,since I didn't know is only 30 days to return.I bought this 1 month in a half in advance.DONT BUY IT"
1.0,"I received this once and it was the wrong item.  I really wanted the necklace and thought it was a one time error, so I ordered it again and got the same WRONG necklace!"
1.0,Small and gonna shrink!
1.0,Been 3 months still haven't received it
1.0,"Cute, fashionable style and colors. Ours looks like they were stored improperly; thus the leather dried out and is cracked at the seam. Poor quality or poorly mismanaged."
1.0,"The material is like a cheap, 90's swim suit. The dress itself it too short to be a dress, too long to be a shirt, and not the right cut to be a tunic."
1.0,Not even close to what it looks like on the picture. Very disappointed with this product!
1.0,"I usually dont  wright reviews but this shirt its ugly. Nothing like the picture. The back is no where the same as it shows on the picture, not low, all loose, and all over the place. DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!"
1.0,Horrrrrrible!!!!!! I want my money BACK!!!
1.0,"REALLY BAD.  Arrived in dirty packaging, fabric was super cheap looking & feeling.  Returned immediately. Deserves zero stars."
1.0,These are not Microfiber at all I would never trust putting any type of sunglasses in these pouches. The description is incorrect. This fabric will scratch your sunglasses. Returning to Amazon. Also the bags are on the small size for sunglasses.
1.0,"I have got to believe that all these 5 star reviews are fake. This suit was too short in the torso and so enormous in the waist and bottom there's no way it was designed to fit a child. Sleeves are so short they are less than 3/4 length, closer to hitting right at the elbow."
1.0,i've only had this watch for two months and its already inexplicably not working. Huge disappointment.
1.0,"The ‚Äúgold‚Äù clip was tarnished, looked oxidized. I know these are cheap but they could‚Äôve st least made them look decent."
1.0,"I liked this robe, but it did not come with the belt as pictured. Sending this back."
1.0,The jeep was not centered on the brim. And the hat did not look like the photo.
1.0,It is huge!! Would of thought it would be medium size or small at least but the necklace was about as big as the top of a can and the earrings werent far behind
1.0,The material was so cheap and flimsy. Do not recommend. Looked like a clown suit
1.0,"Very disappointed!! Gawdy, inexpensive looking, large chunky, photo is deceiving!"
1.0,"Do not buy!!!! This shirt has such a small weird head opening,  I couldn't even figure out how to put it on at first. It is made of cheap material, and doesn't look like the picture!"
1.0,"Not as expected. The frame is very weak, and the lenses aren't gold. They are yellowish"
1.0,"Thin, see through, very low quality<br />Don't buy"
1.0,I didnt like it. very poor quality. looks like plastic.
1.0,Part of bow fell off immediately after taking out of package.
1.0,This is not the colour I paid for The scrub is a light blue not a dark blue
1.0,I have exchanged from large to medium and now inwant a small. Love the dress the fit is just way off
1.0,"This is a tennis/golf shirt. When washed after sweating in it, the shirt dried with horrific stains. This happened on the white shirt, not the light pink one. DEFECTIVE FABRIC"
1.0,To bulky and the elastic around the ankle to loose
1.0,These kept slipping off my feet all day in my loafers.  I have a size 8 foot of average width.  Very unsatisfied...wish I tried sooner so I could have returned...

1.0,The review said it ran small so I went up two sizes still to small the 3x fit like a large but it was beautiful I just hate I could not wear it
1.0,I received this case for my glasses and noticed there was a large round indent in the case. It also does not shut right.
1.0,"Much too small, hard material & too loose around the chest & back area. Strange fit & I wear form fitting clothes."
1.0,"Description says new, got the boots and they were old and used. Never buy again"
1.0,Zipper broke at very first wearing. Too bad because vest is cute.
1.0,"This top is clearly described as a cotton blend. There is no cotton in it. According to the label, it is 65% rayon, 35% polyester. There was no reason to lie about it. Rayon is not a fiber that is usually objected to. Polyester, however, certainly is."
1.0,Broke first time uses. I want my money back
1.0,"In less than four months after wearing these boots, the sole has come apart, the leather on the toung is cracking and the shoe laces are fraying."
1.0,"NOT PRETTY AT ALL, LOOKS USED AND UGLY."
1.0,Very tight for the size.
1.0,Small like for a baby's ankle!
1.0,Turns black!!
1.0,"I bought this product and only got to wear it for one day until the bottom piece fell off and it broke, I was extremely disappointed."
1.0,Would have fit a 10 yr old fine.
1.0,The plastic zipper failed.  Otherwise not a bad bag.
1.0,Like the concept of the dress..comfortably loose from the waist down. But it was cut way too tight across the chest area and under the arms. I think its meant for smaller chested women(about an size A/B). Ended up giving it away. :(
1.0,"In the photo online it looked like there was a tech issue because some of the flowers were completely white, like it didn‚Äôt get printed correctly. Well, that‚Äôs exactly how it looks in real life as well! It‚Äôs like when it was being printed some of the flowers just got left off completely. It‚Äôs very bizarre and does not look good!"
1.0,The fabric is awful  it's cheap costume fabric the buttons are also fake! If it wasn't  such q pain in the but to return it I would. I suppose  I can at least  use it as a pattern  for making my own.
1.0,"WAAAAY too small, my 12 year old niece couldn't even wear them."
1.0,Although I have one other pair of Croc flip flops and 3 pair of Croc sandals that all fit true to size (10) this pair was way too small and cut very strangely.  Had to return them.
1.0,"Fell apart immediately. I purchased multiple letters for family members thinking it would be cute to have matching necklaces. The second they came out of the bag, the stone fell out. One looked like it had been hot glued into place but even that one fell about. Literally never wore them or gave them to anyone - just threw them directly in the trash can."
1.0,They look good on website put them on for about two minutes and you will see it is a total return.
1.0,Complete junk! There are no rhinestones on this item! What a joke! The folks packing these must have been laughing all day about this! Do Not Buy This Item!! It is not what is advertised!! Worthless piece of junk!
1.0,after adjusting the band and used for work it literally broke into two-piece as you can see i wasn't even able to take the blue plastic sticker off..<br /> I will not recommend nor purchase ever again since I thought the first one was my fault however after purchasing a second one I come to realize its just cheap quality
1.0,wish I could write a better review but they really need to step up the quality
1.0,Looked like a cheap slip.Didnt fit/look as described
1.0,Product doesn't work<br />Will not keep time
1.0,Cheap ass product broke after couple days of use
1.0,Does not fit as expected. Super Loose
1.0,This bag broke after using it a few times. Ripped at the zipper and handle broke on one side of the bag.
1.0,It‚Äôs not long enough to be an anklet
1.0,"After just a few months use, the band has split again, barely doing its job. Have ordered a band from another vendor, don't waste your money on this one."
1.0,"Didn't even send these, Sent Calvin Klein leggings. Super disappointed with this purchase"
1.0,"Sizing is not accurate, material is very cheap. Smelled like mildew."
1.0,Too hard for a kid wear. The oppening to put the hand is too small.
1.0,"Too small, the hooks are unreliable."
1.0,Ped√≠ black y llegaron plateados adem√°s traen un ray√≥n en la mica üò≥
1.0,"The left one is fine, the right one however, my heel slips off to the side.  I have to adjust my shoe every couple of feet.  Not fun."
1.0,Way darker than it looks in the pictures. Really more of a gunmetal grey. Returned as I was looking for something that more closely resembled the photo.
1.0,bought the gold and the black mens watches. great when they came. However the gold corroded on the sides within 3 months.  the back one I have finally given up wearing - tried my best BUT it turned my wrist gree!!
1.0,Empty box arrived.  No watch in box!  This must be a scam.  Ugh
1.0,"Unfortunately not a good experience with these. The fabric was a bit odd - not stretchy, sheer, and fit oddly. I wouldn't recommend."
1.0,"The pink is a completely different color, the whole dress is see-through, and it does not look the same as the pictures advertised."
1.0,Package showed as pair but I received one only
1.0,I ordered my size......want go pass my thighs. Definitely not true to size. I would order at least 2sizes up to be comfortable.  Sending back.
1.0,I'm shocked at the rating for these shoes. Unless I just got a bad set. I can't see why anyone would give this a 5 star rating. I bought these for my son for back to school. The color was already bled down into the sole when I opened the box. Only one of the shoe chargers work and the charge didn't last for more then 20 mins. Spend a little more for some others here on amazon.
1.0,Feels cheap and broke in a week. Not really worth even the little amount of money that you spend
1.0,I ordered a large but still found it tight on the arms. The material was thin. I‚Äôm using it  as a cover up rather than a dress
1.0,"Horrible look it shrunk fabric is very cheap, a waste of money really."
1.0,Fell apart in the first week. Do not buy.
1.0,Broke after few weeks
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap and ill fitting.  I gave it to my friends 12 year old.  You have to be a petite person to even hope of getting this to fit an adult ear.  Very disappointed since the dragon is actually cool.
1.0,I am not sure why it comes with the size label and tag missings.
1.0,"Broke the DAY I got it. I expected it to not last, but jesus."
1.0,The shirt is very poor quality. It smelled bad when I got it out of the packaging and the ghosts eyes were crinkled and ugly rather than flat.
1.0,They needed to be put together...
1.0,"These shoes arrived on Thursday, March 22, 2018. My granddaughter put them on and stones immediately started falling out. Now, 3 days later, the soles have come apart. She has only worn them 3 times. I am not bothering sending them back. We will glue them and she can wear them for play. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,I opened the box and there were no instructions and it doesn't work.
1.0,Broke in half along the temple bar when picked up. Only wore about 1-2 times a week and when I wore olive green. No pair of glasses have ever broken like this before. Poorly made and constructed
1.0,Didn't fit over my legs
1.0,The two pins of the press do not line up. Poor workmanship.  Device didn‚Äôt work. Had to return it.
1.0,Nope. They stick straight out to the sides. They look weird.
1.0,20 d√≥lares perdidos
1.0,"Unfortunately the leggings I received were not the ones pictured so I had to send them back. The leggings I was sent were a One Size pair although I had bought a size 6 and the waist band was very unflattering, it squeezed my stomach and sides giving me major muffin top. Also brand name was Always, I took pictures of the product but I‚Äôm unable to upload them onto this review for some reason."
1.0,The most awkward fitting leggings I have ever tried on. Returned.
1.0,Too small for a soccer ball and only holds maybe one shoe.
1.0,Would be cute if it's wasn't a crop top! It's also very cheaply made and very scratchy. Awful in my option.
1.0,If i could give this negative stars i would. The Air Force print virtually wipes right off. It claims that it's a licensed item but i think they are lying because no one would ever license their logo for such a crappy product.
1.0,"The costume had the hands and feet sowed on BACKWARDS! I had to cut both off and re sow the zipper, because of course that was broken too. Size wise, I am 5‚Äù3 and 130 lbs, and an extra small fit fine. Overall, the design of the suit was okay, but definitely not worth half of what I paid for."
1.0,Very soft fabric. The issue is when you go to put them on the fabric is so thin that it comes apart and shows holes
1.0,Nice and soft but first time I wore them there opened up a hole in my big toe .  Thought they would wear better than that.<br />Just got out of hospital so could not get out to return them. Would not recommended.
1.0,SO disappointed with this charm.... it looks nothing like the photo. Devoid of color. Returning...<br /><br />(I even used the flash!)
1.0,This looks like it comes out of a toy Joy machine for a quarter. The gift packaging is a very tacky drawstring satin bag.
1.0,"Horrible,"
1.0,"i was looking forward to this since i had a good bluetooth hat once and this one was half that proce and seemed like it would be the same but it arrive non functional, couldnt even charge so i had to send it back. now i need to get a more expensive one which sucks. I know these are cheap but how hard would it be for the manufacturer to plug them in and just make sure they charge  efote shipping them out. annoying"
1.0,Junk. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money. Not made well.  Strap is garbage. Greatly over priced ... Cute but that‚Äôs all.
1.0,These items run extremely small.  I ordered a 2XL and gave to my 16yr son whose 140lbs and it was small for him.
1.0,Too tight when open the bows almost touch so I tried to adjust and they broke Oh well they were cheap lesson learned
1.0,Not a good fit. Hard to slide on. It made minute scratches on my watch case. I'm returning it!
1.0,Fabric is a cheap clingy poly top not worth half of $22.99.  returning!!
1.0,"They were no better than other night vision glasses I purchased.  They did not cut down glare from oncoming car headlights, just turned the glare into yellow.  Time to return them."
1.0,"The shoes arrived today and when I opened the box, expecting to find a pair of beautiful, pristine ivory satin shoes in perfect condition, I found instead a pair of scuffed shoes that looked like they'd been man-handled by someone with grimy hands. Pretty sure this was the display shoe from a retail store and its mate.<br /><br />Being that I ordered these for my wedding, I was extremely upset. I know that, being ivory satin, they will show dirt, wear and tear pretty quickly once I put them on, but I at least expected them to arrive in new condition. I am returning them. Very disappointed, as the shoe is beautiful as well as comfortable."
1.0,They didn't even fit around the nipple. A waste of money
1.0,El material es muy mal material no me gusto
1.0,"I'm an Xl to XXL depending but lingerie is supposed to be slinky, right? There is nothing sexy about this thing. It is TIGHT and SHORT. It doesn't come across elegant on thick ladies so keep on looking."
1.0,Flimsy and not what I expected. Did not hold my glasses. I could not get them to hold ANY of my glasses.
1.0,They are so cheap. They completely fell apart and are now unwearable.
1.0,"If you want a bag whose strap frays after a few days, this is the one for you. I purchased for a week long cruise to carry my Sea Pass card and phone around the ship and on excursions. Three days into the cruise the edges of the strap had frayed so much that padding was falling out."
1.0,"After a few washes, the cap transformed into a gaiter neck.  Love the design. The reason why I purchased the cap was because of the elephants."
1.0,Runs very very small and short. Returned.
1.0,I like the look and feel of it.  BUT there is a haze on the inside of the crystal so it looks like moisture got inside the watch.  I am going to try to exchange it for a new one.
1.0,"the shirt would have looked great if it was fitted. The tank top was just too wide. I got the blue tank top. The picture is only on the front, the back is all white. After one wash, the color bled into the back. Poor quality."
1.0,We got the kind of sunglasses you can buy for five bucks at the dollar store. Locs are a bit hard to find here so it was very dissapointing.
1.0,"I did not realize the posts of these earrings were plastic, which isn't too bad. BUT, the stones fall out SO easily, there's no point in wearing them. I've lost SEVERAL stones, it's horrible."
1.0,"Poor quality, very disappointed. The top part is very soft but see through and the bottom is crunchy and an odd material."
1.0,Not true to size at all. Color is off aswell.
1.0,I bought these for my 10yr old son.  They are huge!  The size is closer to a adult medium.
1.0,"Plastic, broke when was on uneven surface,"
1.0,It was of very poor quality fabric and looked nothing like the picture.
1.0,This item is so cheaply made that it is almost see through.  The deer aren't part of the fabric they are stuck on.  Did not notice in the description that this was shipping directly from China with no US sizing in it.  Would not purchase again.
1.0,the &#34;flares&#34; are so small the jewelry just falls right out. You'll loose these within the first day. Waste of money.
1.0,runs very small...unwearable...I ordered size indicated for my shoe size...so disappointed because I threw away package before I realized the poor fit...expensive !!!!!
1.0,This is a beautiful necklace and it was supposed to be a gift for me but they've sent the wrong color TWICE. My husband ordered EMERALD and we have gotten TWO BLUE ones. This is terrible.
1.0,This product is no where near the size they claim. I can wear a LARGE sweatshirt/sweater at any other store. I bought this in a 2XL and it was so tight i could barely get it on. dont waste your money.
1.0,"This is a beautiful gown and the fabric is soft, however when I received it the left strap was broken"
1.0,"I might return this swimsuit, don‚Äôt fit me like the picture"
1.0,Runs very large. Ordered a medium & it looks like a 2XL.
1.0,"For a XXX, adult size, this was more of a size 8. Save your money. Go buy a pattern in your size, the material, and sew it yourself."
1.0,I previously purchased the 8/9 year 53 inch one for my very tall 6 year old who stands at 52 inches tall and it was too small. I returned and reordered the 10/11 year 57 inch one and it was STILL too small. It's a great leotard but the sizing is wayyyy off!
1.0,"I ordered twice and had to return twice.  I am normally a medium so I ordered a Large then I was unable to zip it I returned and ordered an extra large, that too I was not able to zip. I had plans to wear for a wedding and I was not able to do so."
1.0,"I purchased this set of eyeglass straps to use with cheap reading glasses.  I typically have several pair of readers around house, so decided to try wearing a pair around my neck rather than constantly searching for readers.<br />This set of eight straps was inexpensive.  Upon receiving them, my first impression was the straps looked very flimsy.  I tightened first strap I tried and it broke.  I've since attached straps and used the included anti-slip hooks.  But hooks fall off, followed by the strap.  Can't imagine these straps holding up during active use with sports glasses.  Anyway, I'll try again with the anti-slip hook.  But afraid I'll just end up tossing the whole set in the trash, glad that I didn't waste more than $9."
1.0,This product is NOT properly sized. I returned the last ones I ordered for the same same damn reason. I wear a women‚Äôs size 6. I ordered Small/Med. These socks would fit a Men‚Äôs size 8 without even stretching to fit. I‚Äôm done with you people at 35 Below!
1.0,The sizing is way off!! Do not buy!
1.0,This dress was horrible.Looks like something my great grandmother would wear. Looks nothing like the picture
1.0,"Bow tie was missing... I bought this months in advance of a wedding only to find out 3 days before the wedding that my package didn‚Äôt have the bow tie in it!!! I know it was probably just a mistake, but still..."
1.0,To small and when u walk up steps they fall down
1.0,this product is s*** women are not built with huge bottoms huge leg holes and itty bitty waist we're not living in the 1820s and we're in corsets whoever designed these has no idea how a woman is shaped.
1.0,Super disappointed
1.0,Cute band and comfortable but design wore off after just a few days of wear.
1.0,This is horrible cheap shiny material. The tag says 85% polyester 15% Spandex. There is no cotton like the description says. It actually gives me the creeps to touch it! Some people order this item and get a good material and they love it. I didn't get that one!
1.0,The cover I received is a fake... printed on both sides and WAY too dark.
1.0,After wearing the item one time I washed it and the red color from the print bleed onto the white fabric and belt.  I had to return.
1.0,Earring was poorly made and the design didn't allow for it to properly wrap around the ear on front and back so it was difficult to get it to stay on. On top of that the cuff part broke off within a week making it completely unwearable. I would not recommend this to anyone
1.0,"These are nice sunglasses, but they are not polarized as advertised"
1.0,Started leaking the second day of usage ... wasted the entire liter of water in the car üôÑ
1.0,"Today, 5/4/2019, the belt mechanism fell apart. Lasted a little over six months.<br /><br />I tried to put it back together, withno success. Luckily I was at home and nit out in public.<br /><br />I love these belts as they do no unravel like the military style ones and it has no holes like the traditional belts. Sadly, this one seems to have been falty. Not sure if it is the brand or design, but I have another belt of a different company with a different design that I hope will last longer.<br /><br />This was my first ratchet belt and I loved it until now.  :("
1.0,Not what I expected...thread stuck together
1.0,"Went up several sizes based on others' reviews and, though they fit, the fit was not flattering.  Did not like the style or material.  Returned for refund."
1.0,Tee stretched out and wrinkled badly. I threw it away
1.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10, 205 pound and I ordered an X-Large size vest and it was way too small. X-large runs more like a medium size."
1.0,The ball is extremely hard to get out and seems impossible to put back when the earring is on the ear.
1.0,"This helmet is a cheap resin cast that doesn't come pre-assembled, you have to attach the ears yourself. Mine didn't fit over the mounting because it was poorly molded and I had to tape them at the back to keep them on. They lasted about halfway through the cosplay party before somebody finally knocked into me and they fell off. The helmet is also easy to bend and crush and barely retains its shape. The visor is just a cheap piece of dark plastic, and if you wear it for more than a few minutes it fogs up and you can't see anything. Buyer beware."
1.0,This item did not look like the item I ordered. The quality of the item was disappointing to me.
1.0,"The goggles don‚Äôt fit inside their container very well.  The strap was hanging out and snapped off, making them too short to wear"
1.0,Very very small<br />Not what I expected at all<br />Seems in nice shape<br />Just big enough for under garments or bath items ..
1.0,"I love these bands. Unfortunately they got the watch perfectly, but they are too big for my wrist. They should come with a shorter and longer length."
1.0,Runs small. Quality is nice.
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to try it, as soon as I opened the box 2 broken clips came out with it. Was willing to give it a try even though there were a few negative reviews but I won‚Äôt be making a 2nd attempt. Will be looking for something similar but more substantial."
1.0,HORRIBLE!!! Extremely small!
1.0,"Did not like the quality, we returned them."
1.0,Not happy. Have to return them.
1.0,These camisoles are incredibly uncomfortable.  I bought the correct size but it sits weird on me.  The shoulder straps hurt my shoulders.  I tried sleeping in it and I changed an hour later..  The hunt for the best camisole with built in bra continues...
1.0,"These might be the most unflattering pants I have ever worn. I got them to wear to work. I work at a school and the dress code is business casual. I wanted a slightly shorter leg so I could wear flats since I do quite a bit of walking around campus. I am 5'9, athletic build, typically a size 4 pants and a small on top. For mere critique purposes, I am fortunate that I genetically have a flat stomach and I just don't carry any extra weight in my midsection. But these pants gave me a full on mommy tummy/kangaroo pouch. There's just so much extra material in the front of the waistband and it puckers and just looks awful. They also somehow, despite being black, manage to make my legs look thicker than they are  and were just horrible. My husband said he thought they were jogger sweatpants and when I said, "" I got them to wear to work."" He replied, ""Oh no. Those are terrible. you can't wear those for work. They look like bad yoga pants."" My husband regularly is a fan of tight pants on me and finds so many unflattering clothes attractive on me. I almost never trust him because he thinks everything looks great, so the fact that even HE thought these were bad means that they are unequivocally, indefensibly bad."
1.0,"Very cheaply made.. wish I could return it, I bought it in Jan for my skiing trip but never used them."
1.0,I am always a C And this is the biggest C ever.
1.0,"Horrible it didn‚Äôt even look the same and it suppose to be a peach kinda pink , it came hot pink"
1.0,The smallest watch for men that I have seen.... Very smal that's for kids
1.0,Tore as soon as I put them on. Will not order again.
1.0,I ordered this piece and was very disappointed by the quality and look.  Unfortunately the window to return has passed.  This piece is very cheap looking and not worth the $30 I paid for it.
1.0,It is way too short. It basically shows my crotch area
1.0,"I purchased two of these. Green and Navy in size medium. I went by the image, and figured they were nice and loose fitting, and the large stated size 14 which would normally have been much too big for me. I guess if there were a ladies 11, that would be my perfect size. Well, the green one is way too small!!! The Navy fits, but the photo is deceiving! I'm disappointed because I wanted them to be more loose fitting. If your looking for it to fit like the photo, order at least a size larger.I guess I will have to return the green one..what a pain..."
1.0,WAAAAY too small. Not worth the money. Super bummed. I even ordered a size larger and it barely covered my boobs
1.0,Didn't look like picture when l received it.
1.0,I gave this to my wife as a Christmas gift and we were terribly disappointed. There were no extra links so the band did not fit.  We tried to return the gift but missed the deadline.
1.0,Very poor quality overall.  Disappointed
1.0,"I bought this as a gift for a young Harry Potter fan. I have several pieces of coin jewelry, which she admires, so I thought she would enjoy this. While it appears to be well made costume jewerly, the majority of the coins on this bracelet are HUGE (over 1 1/2 inch diameter), making it very difficult to wear as intended."
1.0,The nails will rust and they look awful if you have your legs crossed or they are otherwise visible.  This has never happened before when I take my shoes to get professionally done.
1.0,Chinese junk.  I laughed when I opened it.
1.0,"Text is not solid like is pictured, what I received is like a vintage look? Either way I‚Äôm returning it as it isn‚Äôt what I wanted. I will say, however, the shirt itself is very soft. I didn‚Äôt try it on to provide fit feedback."
1.0,The item was too tight in some places and way too big in others
1.0,"Ordered 2 and received one. The band is one inch short from going around my wrist,  Piece of junk."
1.0,"Cheap material, far too small-size chart inaccurate. It can only be worn as a shirt :-/"
1.0,One of the worst amazon experiences of my life. The mask appears black and more closely resembles a mocking of President Obama than the Purge mask. Needless to say my Halloween costume was ruined and I was forced to pay for shipping in order to return this catastrophe of a costume mask.
1.0,"Don't do it!  Within an hour of wearing them the first time, the seam down the front center of the leg unravelled, about 4&#34;.  As the day went on, of course it just kept unravelling further.  I didn't wear them right away, so now I'm out of the return window.  &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; has bit me, rightfully so I suppose."
1.0,I dislike the smallness of the writing on the plaque. I dislike everything about it. It‚Äôs horrible. Idk if I‚Äôll even give it to my son as a graduation gift.
1.0,They fall off the glasses and I lost one
1.0,"I am 5'10"", 125 lbs, and a 34D chest. The size Small was too large in the chest and hips, making me look shapeless and dumpy.  Also, m\Most dresses are too short for me, as I have really long legs but this dress comes to the middle of my knees, which is a terrible length for me. And about the color:  I ordered what I thought was a pretty, dusty pink color, but the actual color is more like weird ""doll flesh"", a brownish pink that is unflattering. Lastly, the fabric itself shouldn't be used on a dress. It's got a slight rubbery feel (and smell).  It's what you'd expect for workout garments, like leggings and tops. I was so displeased with this garment that I am returning it immediately."
1.0,No give to the toe length.  The length was much too short.
1.0,Cute socks but the length is way too short (only goes up to mid calf) so I can't wear them and it's money wasted.
1.0,"This dress came poorly stitched, and is made of fabric like an umbrella. If you want a good laugh or plan on dancing in the rain, then go ahead and  order this dress."
1.0,This shirt is so small it doesn't fit my 12 year old.
1.0,This bra is so padded that it could stand on it's own!  It even comes with extra pads to insert if wanted. I'm a 32 B and when I pit the bra on I looked like a D. Not comfortable
1.0,"The band itself is nice, but where it attaches to the device is cheap plastic & does not stay attached to the watch."
1.0,"OK except for neck. Does not fit like a turtleneck should, burt rather falls around neck. Very poor design."
1.0,It‚Äôs says that they are L shaped and I received them and they are straight. It worked for me but if you need a L shaped one these are not it.
1.0,"SAD CHAIN WASNT ATTACHED TO EARRING ON ONE EARRING, BROKEN UNABLE TO FIX.... BUMMER"
1.0,"All I got was a thin, gauzy top that didn't provide any compression at all.  Looking at some of the pictures provided by other customers, I don't even think I got sent the correct item.  Not happy."
1.0,Note I ordered this along with Hanes boy short and that fitted me comfortably. This was bit tight. I think the fit is not standard for this boy shorts.<br /><br />Please order 1 size higher than standard size.
1.0,terrible. this carrier literally sits in your armpit. You arms are not to your sides at all. Not hidden whatsoever. I returned immediately.
1.0,"I would expect this garment to last longer than 12 months. This shrunk after a couple washes after washing in cold water and has continued to shrink each time until now it‚Äôs un wearable. That‚Äôs a shame cause it really was comfortable, but it‚Äôs not worth the price for it to last such a short amount of time."
1.0,The fit was much smaller than expected.
1.0,"Fun pants, lousy fit. Way too narrow for anyone w/ even the slightest amount of hips! Bummer."
1.0,"Absolutely the worse pair of sunglasses i have ever owned. Very cheaply made, and are NOT polarized as advertised. They are made for a wide face and fall down on my frequently. I would not advise anyone to purchase these."
1.0,Does not stay on head during movement. Chin strap is not designed for comfort if facial hair is present. A poorly designed product.
1.0,"Definitely get what you pay for. The second hand is even off, stopping between second marks. Not a big deal for most, but it is for a nurse. Also, very cheap looking and uncomfortable. It even came in a plastic bag that said &#34;cheap gifts.&#34;"
1.0,"It wasn't what I thought it was going to be... I'm sure someone else will love it, but it wasn't my style"
1.0,Two zippers broke on day one - so - zip zip it goes back to its maker. Don‚Äôt be so cheap in sourcing your zippers that you lose a sale on a decent jacket - that is zipless thinking  and very zipapointing.
1.0,Horrible quality. Shoe color does not match picture
1.0,"I was searching for fit over sunglasses. I happened to look at these sunglasses because they came up to view. However I did not order them, but they were mailed to me anyway....just for looking? They are pretty, so I will &#34;gift&#34; them rather than the hassle to return them."
1.0,Couldn't get it to work returned immediately!
1.0,"I really wanted this to fit me!  But alas it did not. I read all the reviews and had decided on the XL size. Just so you can gauge the fit for yourself.  I am 5'2, weigh around 135 and my bra size is 34dd.  The cups were no where near fitting my breasts at all(so they were small cups) and the band that went around the rib cage was way way to big."
1.0,Not as advertised. They did not darken at all even in bright Texas sun.
1.0,Not as picture very cheap
1.0,For 4 dollars how disappointed can I be? She doesn‚Äôt like it.
1.0,Way to small. I ordered an XL and the pair I got measured what they say is a medium. Also seem to be really poor quality. The pockets are made of a vinyl material like those waterproof bed sheets.
1.0,"Sneaker faded after 2 month.  comfortable sneaker, but looks horrible after a two months of working in outside weather."
1.0,I ordered this Nov 21 of 2021. It came Jan 6 of 2022. I tried it on and it‚Äôs way too small when it should be a perfect fit! I can‚Äôt even get it over my shoulders. I‚Äôm definitely returning this.
1.0,Looks cute and got a lot of compliments however chain tarnishes really quickly
1.0,Color is completely off. Ad shows a turquoise print and the actual color is blue. See photo. Not even close. Total waste of money.
1.0,"This tool has turned out not to be as helpful as an everyday paperclip.  I have not been able to use the tool at all, and reverted to my old method - the paperclip."
1.0,It broke super fast
1.0,Ordered an XL & it's the size of a medium. WAY too small. Inaccurate description & cheap material.
1.0,Backs don't even fit on earrings.
1.0,Not as cute as pictured and does not fire flattering
1.0,I bought these for school and I had the worst time trying to mold them to my teeth.  In the end I never used them and threw them out right away.
1.0,"item looked good, but is weak and flimsy. the middle piece cracked and got a hole in it almost immediately. do not recommend."
1.0,"I was disappointed with this dress, it‚Äôs low quality."
1.0,"Cheaply made, also run a little big"
1.0,"All the items had a very strong plastic smell and when we played with the items, your hands smelled."
1.0,"The fabric is tissue thin, the soles inflexible. I am returning these immediately, as they are not even useful for a single wearing. 'Disposable' is the right description."
1.0,What's the point of a glove when you try to use them to stay warm and put them on for the first time to see two big holes in one of the gloves. SUPER FRSUTRATING...these were bought for a trip to Chicago so therefore I did not have any gloves to wear for the trip.
1.0,Ordered 3 month and my son won‚Äôt be able to wear until at least next year. It also is already fraying.
1.0,band lasted 3 months don't buy.  One side of band broke where it attaches to sence.  People aren't pleased...drop line
1.0,The earrings arrived damaged never wore them
1.0,Cheap material and long
1.0,A diamond was missing within the first two weeks and now I can‚Äôt return it.
1.0,This product is a waste of money even if it was cheap. Broke as soon as I tryed to put it on really a rubberband would have lasted longer I wish I could rate it no star but I have too REALLY SUCKS DONT WASTE YOUR TIME EVEN LOOKING AT THIS!!!!! Just go to forever 21 and get.some that will last
1.0,I ordered this in LARGE and it would not even FIT AROUND ME!!!!  I wear a size 10....
1.0,"Tiny, don't use for anything except the skinniest of skinny ties."
1.0,These socks have a swastika pattern on them! Yeesh.
1.0,Way too small it is a major disappointment but the seller was quick to respond to me and offer a refund. I am 5'3&#34; and a large didn't even cover my butt it is that short. I gave it to a friend and she is going to maybe wear it with leggings. I wanted a thinner comfortable dress not a shirt.
1.0,Cheap and flimsy screen protector id not built in.
1.0,"There are no instructions on how to set this.  I did find a YouTube video about setting it.  However, somehow the time got changed on the watch.  Now I have to find the YouTube video again, to set it.  It is not user friendly and I do not recommend the watch.  I am already looking for a replacement watch."
1.0,Unable to use. Returned the first day of an attempt to use. The earring broke. Very disappointing
1.0,If you have a problem with this product....no one will get back to you.
1.0,"Masks had a very strong chemical smell that was unbreathable, I washed them four times and it wouldn't come out, so I threw them in the trash."
1.0,Sent the dress back. The material was too thin.
1.0,"Material is cheap, color is not as expected, cheap looking and feels like a very thin foam on the inside. Packaging was horrible and there were no padding inside so there's a crease on the bottom. I hate it."
1.0,Totally different face
1.0,"I spoke to a young man for hour, regarding this among other things. The show was too small. I was promised a return but nothing ever came of it, and a great deal of time was wasted."
1.0,I‚Äôve had these pants for less than a month and I‚Äôve worn them three times. Third times wearing they ripped in the crotch while at the gym.
1.0,No lo recomiendo de muy mala calidad demasiado gruesos solo perd√≠ mi dinero
1.0,This item fell apart. Won't stay in my ears. Won't stay hooked. Not happy.
1.0,has what looks to be rusty spots on the ear post.
1.0,Pretty cheap feeling.
1.0,Not long at all cheaply made. Thin fabric.
1.0,Not buying again..
1.0,Stone fell off the first day
1.0,Product was broken when opened opened package.
1.0,The hat is pure junk. Chinese junk..
1.0,Not sized properly - sized for a child.  Had to return.
1.0,Socks are so small that I cant even get get half my foot into them. If i got them on im afraid they would cut of circulation.
1.0,"I received Style 3 instead so I don't know how Style 2 would have looked in person<br /> They wouldn't let me return and receive my original order. Style 3 looks terrible. Nothing like the picture, and has cheap straw like pig tails, which I'm not sure that's what they were going for."
1.0,Must be a women's large. Way too small
1.0,"This looks nice, but it smells horrible.  I could not stand the chemical smell, no matter what you do, it will not come off.  The smell even gets stronger the more you try to cover it up.  I found out it's not functional to use this cover as it is too large to carry on your person in the airport. Get a hanging next pouch for your passport, it is so much easier to handle."
1.0,"I sent this one back. The seam was uneven, making it look really cheap."
1.0,Misleading info on the size and picture. The acuslly product is very small. Have to return . Very disappointed
1.0,I'm more of a 3X and ordered 3X-4X thinking I'd be good.  These had absolutely no stretch and I literally couldn't pull them up past my calf.  First time I'll ever return an Amazon purchase.
1.0,Don't fit.
1.0,"Box says made in China, size: US 10, EU 27; their chart shows US 11.5, EU 27. I bought US 11.5-got a 10!<br /><br />I bought another pair of their shoes, the box said US 11.5, EU 27, but still too small; both pairs have to be sent back!  My granddaughter was very upset that she couldn‚Äôt keep them.  Fortunately, the Stride Rites, I bought at the same time, size US 11.5 fit perfectly."
1.0,"These are not fleece. They are lined by some type of fur. My daughter was going to be in a New Year's Day parade. We bought these to keep her warm. Luckily, she wore them before the parade. We were just walking, and she started feeling an unbearable itching, then a fiery type itching. She was jumping up and down in obvious discomfort. She ran to the hotel to get these off. She said they left scratch marks on her legs. Luckily I had a pair of actual fleece leggings I had purchased as a back up."
1.0,Super cheap looking. Tossed it after a week
1.0,Too small didn‚Äôt look like picture
1.0,It looked nothing like the picture it didn't give sizes so I assumed it twisted on its own and it didn't it was just awful all around
1.0,scuffed up in a minute. cheap looking and very uncomfortable and size runs larger
1.0,Would not recommend. Odered a large when I usually wear a medium and it's still wayyy too small. And it's missing a button.<br />Poor experience
1.0,These glasses are shaped really weird ! Ugh
1.0,Did not receive the jewellery. I‚Äôll happily update if I can actually wear it.
1.0,"My wife bought these for me.  At first, I was excited and I liked them.  These were delivered on 6/13.  I only wear them while driving in the car.  Otherwise, they are in the glasses holder.  I noticed them fitting a little weird yesterday.  Took them off to look at them, and the plastic around one of the screws had broken off.  I will be returning these, and considering the amount of similar reviews, won't be purchasing a new pair."
1.0,was not at all happy with it!! should have papers with it so it could be returned. now stuck with something i'm not pleased with.
1.0,XL is like a L  and the L is like a M
1.0,Not that comfortable but my daughter loved them. Same size as a similar shoe she tried on at Traffic.<br /><br />Update: My daughter wore these for my wedding in February. She wore them again (May) just the other day for the second time and one of them fell apart. They should hold up for more than 1 wear.
1.0,"Initially, this was a great bag.  My husband had been searching for *the* gym bag for a while when we read about the Glo Bag.  We purchased one in August of 2014, and the bag is already falling apart (it is now May 2015). The inside shelves starting tearing within a couple of months, but now the external seams are failing, and there is a huge rip/hole where the side of the bag is just coming undone.  Very disappointed, especially considering the cost."
1.0,"This draft board was HORRIBLE. On the board the draft rounds had typos and were out of order. They completely forgot to add a page of wide receiver stickers and added a second, identical,  sticker list of running backs. Complete waste of money."
1.0,"too ,long returned"
1.0,This is the thinnest dress I've ever purchased. I sent it back. It fit ok. It's also off on the color. It's way darker than pictured. For $22 bucks!!! No way would I pay that for a dress paper thin!!
1.0,Wore these pants twice and all the zippers are broken already. Save your money and buy different pants
1.0,Nope nope nope. Sent it back. It was like an oddly shaped cheap looking prom dress. Not for me
1.0,"This is a cute dress but after one wash, the black is totally faded. Looks old and I cannot wear it again. Waste!"
1.0,"I hated the way the fabric feels, it feels cheap with no softness nor stretch. Because there‚Äôs no real stretch the fit runs a bit small."
1.0,I would not recommend purchasing this item. I wore it once the color changed and it consistently get tangle
1.0,no user manual in box
1.0,Too small. Can see the whole frame.
1.0,"These might be good socks, but they apparently only come in one size: L/XL. Since I wear medium, I had to return them. Description should state the size."
1.0,"It was for a surprise Anime themed birthday party, we couldn't return it in time, it was my daughters surprise party. The inner tie, like a robe tie, doesn't correlate with the size, it does nothing to keep it closed or protect the chest. It was a teen party and I had 3 Tengen Wives with their boobs on display, (almost). We had to run up to the party store and make 3 costumes. It's not Halloween they don't have a lot of selection and zero Anime. $90 (30x3) plus taxes wasted."
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt<br />Fit or<br />Stretch
1.0,We ordered this twice in two different sizes and both were too small.  The top doesn't fit like the listed sizes.
1.0,The shirt was ok and head piece but pants too small.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. This print is very very faded and the material is very cheap and Halloween costume quality.
1.0,They fit as expected size-wise but didn't last very long.  They started coming apart after a few washes.
1.0,It came solid in the container. Not usable. Waste of $.
1.0,They fit my child‚Äôs face better and some were massive. Not returnable. Waste
1.0,Bad quality of the fabric. I would like to send it back but it would cost me more hassle so id rather keep it and i dont know where to use it or it this will be of use someday.
1.0,Not very good quilty. Would not buy again
1.0,It fell apart the very first time I put it on
1.0,the way it fits on the ear makes the back side very visible and it is not very presentable
1.0,"There is a label on the glasses ""contains known cancer causing chemical and is banned in California"".  Pretty sure it'll cause cancer anywhere.  DO NOT BUY"
1.0,"These are not the same as the Hanes other briefs I've purchased.  The quality and fit are very poor.  The leg openings are too wide and they ride up.  I would not recommend this product.  I wish that Hanes still made the good ones with the covered waistband that I got before.  I can no longer find them!  Also, this product is hard to return.  Not the usual easy return by Amazon!!"
1.0,"First of all, battery died prematurely twice.  Both times it was replaced by a reputable jewler.  The third time the jewler told me the watch is dead because of water leakage into the housing.  Indeed, there was rust inside the watch.  Second of all, to replace the battery, you have to remove the pins from both straps - an incredible feat in itself, since the pins are very difficult to remove.  Third, the wrist band is very stiff and uncomfortable.  Fourth, the glass face is very reflective and it makes reading the display very difficult.  Fifth, when you remove the watch and place it on any surface, chances are that you will depress the light switch on the side of the watch, and then if you don't notice it, you will drain the battery very fast.  Final tally: don't buy this thing, spend your money on something better."
1.0,SMALL!!! The photos from the Amazon customer with a navy bag are a fraud. That is not the size of the bag you will receive. You will receive the bag with small dimensions as listed. It's is barely bigger than some lunch bags. It is not a gym bag or a weekender bag. You will not be able to fit your items in it unless you're Stuart the Mouse. Buyer beware!
1.0,did not want her to have to dry clean
1.0,These socks do not keep my husbands feet warm as we were hoping. After a recent heart attack and going on blood thinners as well as living in an extremely cold climate he is always cold. These socks were not helpful.
1.0,Good material but run small. Needs to order 2 sizes bigger
1.0,"Very poor quality, the strap on the back got ripped after a few uses."
1.0,Fabric not good and it fits very weirdly
1.0,I am disappointed with the item. Picture showing that there is no print text brand in the upper right of the wallet that's the reason I bought one but the item I received there is.
1.0,Bought for my baby niece and it‚Äôs runs small! I bout the size for my 18 month old niece and the top was like for a 9 month old we couldn‚Äôt even get it on her! I had to give it away
1.0,I was very disappointed in the materials. Did not like it at all
1.0,Will not buy again. You get what you pay for and these are pretty crappy.
1.0,Wow didn't expect L to be a small. Don't fit
1.0,I hated it! I feel like I just wasted my money on this
1.0,Felt really cheap and was to small
1.0,The back of the top is melted and they try to sew it cover it up.
1.0,These glasses that I received are completely crooked and have an inch long scratch on one lens. I can't wear these!
1.0,"Wrong color, awful feeling fabric, different front top area than in the picture too. I can't wear it. Getting a refund from Amazon."
1.0,"I purchased this to wear when traveling, instead of my expensive one. I wasn‚Äôt aware it would be quite as ‚Äúcostume-y‚Äù in style. It would be great for prom or pageants, but it‚Äôs not a good copy or replica of an original tennis bracelet. It‚Äôs a bit sparkly. Sturdy fastener/clasp. Nice construction. The CZ just miss the mark."
1.0,After 1 week the silver started to tarnish and turn a copper color. I am very disappointed in the quality of this belly ring. I really wanted to like it.
1.0,Received this and beads were all over the place; I never did return it but tried to repair and it worked for a while but then eventually fell apart with beads flying everywhere.  Beautiful in theory but never really worked well.
1.0,Not leggings at all
1.0,"Super disappointed, didn‚Äôt realize this was a full wrap dress. Was also basically see through. Really wanted to wear this to a winter wedding."
1.0,This dress is not loose like shown on picture. It repeats the curve of your waist and this is not smth I was looking for. Material is soft
1.0,It was very beautiful and all but unfortunately I couldn't find a way to close it.
1.0,"The lower part of the dress is a nice fabric, but the upper lace part is low quality. The dress I received was dirty and had holes and snags in the top. I promptly returned."
1.0,"The pants fit ok but go up a size, but the shirt is big in the shoulders and tight around the stomach , I ordered a 3x!"
1.0,It should be more stiffer the front
1.0,It's too wide and too short. Material is cheap and thin. It's junk.
1.0,Th material is terrible. The only way I know to describe it is like dry fit or like a bathing suit. The material is shiny and the inside of the dress is white. That wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if it wasn‚Äôt a high low type of fit. You can see the white lining at the hem. Terrible. I‚Äôm returning ASAP
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Thin super cheap material.
1.0,Very tiny and cheap. Looks like something you get from a gum ball machine. Great message. Too bad you can't see it?
1.0,"Really disappointed. When i first purchased a band from Archer, the idea of Made in California and Horween leather grabbed me. When I got the product, I was really let down. I returned the band because of the second loop closest to the buckle. The thing is huge, oversized, and mis-shapen!!! see my photo. I decided to give Archer a second chance, This is the SECOND band. The first was just as bad. Only this time, I got a band that had been used ( see photo crease on band) and the silver buckle was filthy dirty. So much for second chances.... Buyer Beware!"
1.0,Sent it back instantly.
1.0,Cheap material buyers be aware
1.0,not at all what it appears to be. tries to make comparison with the ridge wallet & they are no where close. 2 pieces of metal & nothing holds them together except for the elastic strap. it's like having 2 extra credit cards???
1.0,"Mi pedido no me llego, o fue entragado en ptea direcci√≥n, pueden responderme por favor"
1.0,Too big for lady fingers
1.0,These were initially good... I was happy with the length and material but after the first wash the straps completely frayed and broke. 2 of the 4 tanks are now rags... I'm sure after the next wash they will all be in the rag bin.
1.0,I like the idea of this three piece set but the material was odd and definitely not natural.  I bought it in two different sizes and in two different colors and returned all
1.0,Super uncomfortable. I should have spent the extra cash and got something better. I'm donating these to goodwill and already feel bad for whoever ends up with them. I wear size 10 and these fit like a 9 or 9.5
1.0,These are really made for little people
1.0,DON‚ÄôT waste your money!!!
1.0,Broke the first day I used them.
1.0,Size is not even close
1.0,"Very disappointed with this case. Very cute but smells so bad. I tried leaving it on my porch for a while and that didn't help so I washed it. Now it shrunk, all wrinkled and misshapen and still has an unpleasant odor."
1.0,Very thin material that snags easily. The edges are not hemmed. Waste of money.
1.0,"I ordered a large and it did not fit. The description sounded like a large wound fit an adult, I don't have a particularly large head. It was way too small. It might fit a child though.<br />Also, the bonnet that I received was a bright pink color. Bright pink is not historically accurate at all!<br />If your looking for a cute baby bonnet this might work. If you are looking for a costume piece than don't waste your money. I really wish I could return it!"
1.0,not the right color off of what it shows online
1.0,"Would be a cute costume, but an apparent short in the hand-held controller for the air-pump that is supposed to keep it inflated makes it frustrating and nearly worthless.  Now scrambling to find replacement costume my 6yo daughter is excited about."
1.0,"Bought these for my mother who suffers from lymphedema. First time putting them on her, a hole tore in the top of one. Then more holes easily developed, near the top on Both socks. Have bought other brands with no such issues. Would not recommend."
1.0,"Usually I'm a medium or a large, but I was expecting it to be small so I ordered a large. However, it was much too small, and I could barely fit it over my head.  I would recommend to go up two sizes."
1.0,Weak plastic and very disappointing that the case is better quality than the sunglasses.
1.0,These shoes were coming apart and my son only wore them less than a month.
1.0,"For almost $21, I don't expect luxury, but I expect it to be on par with a short I would purchase from a big box retailer's house brand.  Or this site's ""Basics"" even.  These are not even close.  They are extremely thin material.  The sewing/stitching is not at all like it appears in the pictures.  It is a basic straight seam everywhere.  They are going to fall apart quickly.<br /><br />The sizes, well, don't expect them to fit.  I did find the sizing chart, which, I should have found BEFORE I ordered them.  That's on me.  But a 38"" or 40"" waist is not a 2XL.  I know we're bigger in the USA, but these aren't anywhere near the size you would expect them to be.<br /><br /> It's not just the size though. I would expect these to be under $10, and even that might be too much for as cheaply as they are made.  The buttons are about as cheap as I have ever seen on a pair of shorts.  Heck, I haven't even tried them one, and there are threads coming out of their seams already.  The material is almost see-through it's so thin.  No, I'm not exaggerating.<br /><br />You can find better shorts for the same money on Amazon.  Don't spend your money on these."
1.0,"I am normally a med-large, so to be safe I got an XL in this shirt. It fit like it was an XS or made for a child."
1.0,The fit is sized wrong. Definitely size up 1-2 sizes
1.0,"The description says that this dress comes with both the colored overdress and white underdress, but when I received mine it was just the overdress. I‚Äôm really disappointed and I thought maybe I accidentally only ordered the overdress, but I checked and I had ordered both and only received one. :("
1.0,"Like previous reviews.  The clip on one side of the strap broke and cannot be repaired.  I paid $189 for this cute bag, and after such a short time it is now garbage.  Everyone on here deserves a replacement, with improved parts.  So Sad HOBO bags have always been my favorite!  Those who have given good reviews, have obviously not used their bags much, as theirs' will eventually brake too."
1.0,These were very uncomfortable and ran small
1.0,Cheap material. Fits weird.
1.0,"One broke as soon as I took off the backing. Also, they're way smaller then it looks in the picture."
1.0,"My dad loved this vest! We had high hopes. It's nice looking and comfortable and warm. But after only 2 weeks of use, it got extremely hot and 2 holes burnt through the back!!!!"
1.0,"It doesn't work. Straight from Wish! Hatch doesn't stay in the lower button and if you bend over, it shows!"
1.0,"Many of the ""jewels"" fell off the wand within the first 5 minutes of playing with it. Also in those 5 minutes, the jewel on the necklace came off. My daughter loves the gloves though."
1.0,This band does not look like the picture at all.
1.0,another rag
1.0,The rings broke within 1 hour of wearing them. Snapped into 2 pieces and the diamond fell off
1.0,Fabric fuzzed up on outside after 4 wearings. Will have to discard. Not a good value for me
1.0,"In items like this I normally order a L, but this one I ordered XL, tore at the inner thigh first time I wore it!! And since I ordered it bigger it was not too tight, I had already decided I was going to go back and order the L, but nope."
1.0,It's just not right for my shape.
1.0,Bathing suit was very cute and 6yr old loved it but the straps fit strangely. One side has an adjustable thin strap that works great but other thicker strap just falls off the shoulder constantly. Who wants to keep pulling up one strap all the time when swimming? She just tried it in and we realized quickly. She was sad we had to return it but there was no way to get it to stay up unless seeing it but not worth that. If both were just regular adjustable staps then this suit would of worked
1.0,Well i liked this watch very much i got it back in October it lasted some time its just now the middle of December and changing colors so for the price i got my money worth it still ticks tho but will tarness keep that in mind.
1.0,they are not warm at all !! very thin socks!! I'm sending them back.
1.0,"It's an elastic material, not cute like the picture. :(."
1.0,Had a glare
1.0,"Item was smaller than advertised, flimsy and altogether cheap. I wouldn‚Äôt put a old piece of gum in this thing let alone my cell phone. Zero confidence that it would hold up."
1.0,"Looks worn, wash it for the first time in cold and no dryer, anf it just faded.  Looks so bad"
1.0,Very cheap quality. Material felt like paper. Customer service was excellent.
1.0,Not very supportive for a larger bust.
1.0,Not as advertised way to big.
1.0,"It fits perfectly, poor quality work the colors are run together"
1.0,That is horrible gloves in my life
1.0,Wore them just a couple times and they fell apart.  total junk.  DO NOY BUY!
1.0,These shorts are way to small. I ordered an XL and it literally looks like a child XL.
1.0,I find it hard to believe this is leather. Feels and looks like cheap vinyl. The color is off too. It has a pinkish hue to it in bright light.
1.0,The stripe does not go all the way around the sweatshirt...The picture is deceiving.
1.0,I couldn't believe this piece of junk. I thought it was a joke.<br />As soon as I took the earrings out of the package they literally fell apart. It's unbelievable how bad they are. Looked to see where they were made....<br />They're made in China.
1.0,"Want expecting much for the price, but come on. The clasp broke immediately after opening it up to put on the bracelet. The dragon looks much better in the picture. Dollar Store quality. My 11yr old daughter was very disappointed."
1.0,"I got a mightyland watch that,s waterproof,it's a little big how do you undo the link to make it small,318-359-7114,that,s my number donna Juneau"
1.0,It didn't fit me! I wound up donating them to a friend. Sad day.
1.0,Do not buy this‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs worth about $1. The hat was closed to being ripped when I unpacked it and I knew the broom would be plastic but it‚Äôs bad. Talk about a total rip off.
1.0,"2 strips of Velcro detached and 1 other started coming off of the band after the first wear, rendering the band basically useless. I am returning and hope to find a nylon band I like that does not have this problem. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
1.0,Material was almost see through and fits one size too small.
1.0,Looks cheap but great for kids
1.0,To cannot bo wrong wioth anything from Under Armor. Comfortable as they advertise and wick away moisture just as they say. Plus give you support so can work extra ghours to pay for them!!
1.0,"He hat is very small, the sides don‚Äôt even come close to reaching your ears. The fabric is crooked compared to the brim of the hat."
1.0,I don‚Äôt recommend .. please size up if you purchase‚Ä¶ And  if your over 5‚Äù2 this dress will fit like a shirt
1.0,Does not help
1.0,This jumpsuit is more like a clown costume than a garment. The fabric is like what they make shower curtain liners from and it‚Äôs so wide through the middle that it could only fit a clown. Looks cute in the picture but hideous in person.
1.0,Had it for exactly 1 day before it stopped had to wind it every 10 hours or so  and the last time I wound it it ran for 1 hour then quit returning immediately. ...the quality of the ring is fairly nice. ..plastic face but quality is with the price. ..if it still worked
1.0,Broke first time wearing!
1.0,"Awful. Doesn‚Äôt make you sweat, cheap fabric, poor quality"
1.0,Not gold plated items turned black after a few wear DO NOT BUY
1.0,No es lo q me prometieron el color esta horrible es azul sucio esta muy feo
1.0,Fit on the yellow floral is a full size smaller than expected if not more. Material was thin and had that shininess of cheap fabric.
1.0,Not worth the money I have pieced the necklace back together with a sauder tool Never again
1.0,Not a good quality!!! It looks cheap
1.0,"I was really excited about these earrings and they're very pretty, but they turned black immediately, leaving my piercing holes black and infected. Would not recommend. **Update** An hour after submitting this review, one of them broke."
1.0,"I loved the bracelet. The third time I wore it, came apart."
1.0,"Pros:<br />1. For the entire 10 seconds of its life, it was a really nice belt and I felt a surge in my self esteem while putting it on.<br />2. The cardboard box that it came in is infinitely more durable than the belt itself. And you can cover it with cool paper mache, so that's kind of a bonus!<br />3. The bonded leather came pre-separated right out of that awesome box, so you can easily peel it the rest of the way to make two belts and gift one to a friend or co-worker - or make an old-tyme barber style razor-sharpening strop out of it.<br />Cons:<br />1. The buckle is attached to the belt using a very small diameter pin. It's metal, but a very cheap alloy. As I was buckling it for the very first time, it snapped in two.<br />2. The seemingly cheap price is actually quite expensive when amortized over the duration of its usefulness, at around $50/minute, or about $5,000,000/year. I try to limit my purchase decisions to belts that cost less than $1,000,000/year, even if they're reversible. Well, maybe a little more if they come in a cool cardboard box. But, this is 5x my usual budgeted cost for belts. Now, off to try on some suspenders."
1.0,The zipper was not properly sewn which made it impossible to wear.  I only received a partial discount on a product that was defective.
1.0,"I don‚Äôt know why I keep thinking I can purchase a decent, affordable piece of women‚Äôs clothing on Amazon. Like the last ten items I‚Äôve purchased, this thing is so flimsy it must have cost about five cents to produce. The cloth is so thin you can see right through it. Every line and crease of your undergarments (and your body) is visible right through it. Do not waste your money."
1.0,"This would not even go over my hand and I have small hands and fingers. My wedding ring is a size 6. This bracelet is for a small school-aged child. I'm going to gift this to my granddaughter. She's only two, so my daughter is going to put it up and save it for when she gets older and it fits. It is of good quality and is very pretty, but I recommend purchasing it for a little child of school-aged such as between the ages of 7-9."
1.0,Actually fit great and felt much softer and normal than expected for waterproof. But that's bc it wasn't waterproof... the knee material fully flows water.
1.0,Seemed to be made of cheap material.  Broke first time wearing it.  I returned it...
1.0,"i allowed my son to purchase this choker . do not want to pay return shipping . it stinks horrible . as a horse owner we know how to treat leather --expensive soap , many tries + it is a stinging mess of cheap urine soaked leather . [  urine is an ancient cheap way  used for curing leather  from ages ago --also a real  health risk ] . this should have been noted prior to your listing this item for sale .  . you  took his  gift  money . he later ordered a game from you --it is damaged ---he cannot use it  not even once . again the shipping thing . i will no longer  buy my son a amazon gift card due to the awful products recieved and the shipping !! teens do not know about internet ordering . i thought you were a good place to allow him to order from . cathy kombol"
1.0,There is a whole and it's a week past date to return
1.0,"The sleeves are not tight at the wrist, the size say the right size but the sleeves are horrible"
1.0,"The color they show in there pictures is false, so if you want something truly green don't buy these lenses, they  are see thru from the front to which in the pictures it shows it's not transparent but they are another let down."
1.0,Bought two. Both buckles broke after limited use
1.0,I purchased two scarfs and neither of them will charge or turn on.
1.0,Gripping ability lost after 1st washing. I need socks with anti slip properties. These are not those typr
1.0,I orderd size 6 they delivery size 8  those ppl dont know how to read<br />I orderd size  9 in orange really cute color way too big<br />Is men shoe not woman
1.0,I'm so disappointed I got to wear this necklace once. I stored it in my jewelry box and went to put it in today and the chain was broken
1.0,These are made from a flexible plastic it seems and stick together. They are also super small.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:4060c7e3b4f1a387d62417187ee8eb]] Watch the video. You‚Äôll get all the info you need from it. Will never order from this company again. Doesn‚Äôt even deserve one star. If I have to do one star to submit this I will. So I have to waste my time fixing it or sending it back for a replacement. Which means I‚Äôve wasted my laundry detergent, fabric softener, water, and electricity to have to do it all over again. Maybe petty to you but I have to work for a paycheck for a living."
1.0,"Ordered 6-12 months, and received size 80, which is European size equivalent of 12-18 months. Haven't decided yet if I want to keep this for a year, or just send it back. For now, I have to reschedule the photo session and find another outfit. Good thing this wasn't for a wedding!"
1.0,ugh no
1.0,I have purchased several belts from this site and been very happy with the price and quality.  BUT for some reason this particular belt does NOT meet higher standards.  I see that it is not available at this time...that's a GOOD thing.
1.0,Ancha y corta. El corte de la.blusa estaba raro y malhecho
1.0,"This product looked like a decent quality one from the pictures and the price. What a disappointment!<br />I have worn this twice, one of the pockets started ripping apart among the seam right away for just potting my wallet in there, and a couple of days later one of the sleeves started detaching too. See for yourself in the pictures.<br />Definitely won't buy again from this vendor.<br />Hopefully I can return it for a full refund."
1.0,"I bought this in black in small, way to small. I bought it in brown in small and it fit but a little snug around the top. I ordered it in brown in medium way to small."
1.0,I ordered a medium. 5.0‚Äù and 135lb. Boobs are 34D. The dress was really shear and did not fit. I will be returning it
1.0,"The whole reason I ordered this pack was for the 3 Sanderson Sisters. I didn‚Äôt get Mary! Also, the 1 shown in the picture is messed up! Very unhappy!"
1.0,100% see thru. cheap and very ugly.
1.0,"Earrings were not as pretty as pictured. They look cheap, of bad quality and dirty. Very disappointed with the purchase, even the box were they came looked cheap. It was a waste of money on my perspective."
1.0,Extremely cheap fabric. Feels like I‚Äôm wearing baby doll clothes. Also smaller than expected.
1.0,I purchased this to take on my vacation but it did not work out.  The waist was too small and the length about a foot too long.<br />I was very disappointed because it is a beautiful skirt.
1.0,X-Large just aint what it used to be. If you weigh 110 lbs this XL will fit as shown in picture.
1.0,These are huge in the hip area. If you have a slender figure they will not fit well. Also came up way to high for my liking. Had to return them.
1.0,I purchased this dress in the red and the navy. I returned both because the fabric was so thin. I could see through the dresses when holding them up and looking through both front and back panels. I really wanted to love these since I own similar dresses from another brand. These just were not a good quality fabric.
1.0,Only cut pattern on one side. Too small of opening to get around the earlobe.
1.0,"I‚Äôve had this band about 2 months. The band is really cute but it keeps popping off, the spot where is connect to the Fitbit keeps coming loose."
1.0,Can in with holes in one of the pairs.
1.0,Not white like it says
1.0,The ‚Äúleather‚Äù ripped the first day I had them. Extremely poor quality!
1.0,"I feel like these were false advertisement. I felt like they would be a different material. Definitely seems like they will leave blisters. I was expecting better, but I guess that‚Äôs what you get when you buy 8$ shoes lol!"
1.0,Tarnished after two wears and I didn't even wet them !
1.0,This is nowhere near the color depicted. I will be returning it.  It more of a barbie or bubble gum pink definitely  not what's shown.
1.0,This is the second pair and they have a hole in the same spot as the first ones. Will not purchase again. Bad sticking
1.0,"I loved this blouse initially I only wore this blouse one or two times then a white substance appeared all over the front of it. It didn‚Äôt come out in the wash, either."
1.0,"I couldn't tell you if this is a good jacket or not.  I ordered one size larger than I usually wear, wears two to three sides smaller.  Definitely not true to size AT ALL. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it and looking for a new coat."
1.0,Very thin and clingy. üò°
1.0,"When the umbrella arrived I opened and closed ir and put it away.  When I went to use it, I was able to open it and when I tried to close it I could not do it. I'm adding a pic showing how is now, nor fully open or close. I have to throw it away."
1.0,the sports bras didn't fit my daughterand I tryed to find a different size but they didn't  have her size
1.0,Buttons fell off 1st time worn.  Very thin material and not very warm.
1.0,My son wears for golf
1.0,Tarnished after only have 3 months. Never even worn. Very disappointed.
1.0,Key ring broke off within a week
1.0,The material was cheap feeling and the fit is very unflattering. Like old lady pants. I returned them.
1.0,These earrings are nice and light but they open and fall off very easily because the hole is much bigger than the thin hoop. I wish I could return them but I am past the returning period allowed!
1.0,I really wanted to like this but I can not even wear it because it literally cuts me where the bottom of the zipper is. I‚Äôve tried a few different times after I healed thinking if I made some adjustments I could make it work but no matter what after a few minutes it started to chafe so bad that it cut me. Unfortunately it was a waste of money and I can‚Äôt return it.
1.0,"My daughter bought this for school (she‚Äôs a junior in high school and a huge anime fan), and was so excited to get this. She received it on Feb 13th, and it broke yesterday, March 19th, of course 4 days after the refund/return window closed. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this item. My daughter is very careful with her things, takes good care of her belongings, was checking out at a grocery store when the strap snapped and the whole bag dropped off her shoulder. Obviously a cheaply made piece of crap."
1.0,I didn't like the fit.  Hung kinda loose on me.  I returned the dress.
1.0,It‚Äôs a nice short but the areas around the elbows are ore out very quickly. The shirt only lasted for less than a year where I‚Äôve never had this problem with other shirts.
1.0,The description said it was black.  But it sure isnt!!! Also the collar does not lay down nice!!
1.0,Pura lata no me gustaron
1.0,The photo and actual product are worlds apart
1.0,Do not recommend<br />The ratcheting part broke very quick and it never held any way it
1.0,This is so cheap & thin! Completely see through. I will be returning
1.0,"This mask has the worst rubber smell of any masks I've encountered and you could smell the rubber on your face for hours after wearing it. I could only see out of one of the eye holes, which were both very narrow, and it was extremely hard to breathe in. The mask does look pretty realistic but it is certainly not worth the $25 price."
1.0,"You get what you pay for. As you can see in the photo (size large), the crotch area of the pants is WAY too long. 15 inches from belt to crotch bottom!? The zipper is also too short, so the crotch length is more than twice the length of the zipper. The result is that the pants feel restrictive and tight unless you pull the waist up way too high."
1.0,Not layered just a thin one
1.0,I ordered a 4xl. It is SMALL. My size 12 daughter could hardly get her arms in it. Lesson learned.
1.0,Terrible product. After sweating outside for about 10 minutes bra starts to slip and fall
1.0,"Had to return it.  Sorry... The material was soft, but flimsy.  It was cute-ish, but not worth keeping IMHO."
1.0,They came with the glass broken!
1.0,I received the 18 month sweater which says I love mam when it should say mom. They sent me a second one and it still says I love mam.
1.0,The jacket was about 2 or 3 sizes smaller than i ordered it said 3x but i wear 2x and it still did not fit
1.0,These are literally the cheapest sunglasses I have ever SEEN never mind purchased.
1.0,Large size came out too small
1.0,"I absolutely hate it in every way.  It is not sweater type material. It is a hard quilt lining material (close to wool) that has no stretch, the collar is a little over an inch and sewn on.  This was made in the back yard or under ground.  I have absolutely nothing made out of this heavy non-movable and non-breathable material. It is too heavy to flow.  The stitching is beyond awful.  I ordered it on Dec 9 and received it Jan 31.  I sent a message to the company and never got a response.  Amazon should take this company off their site because this is the lowest of the low.  I have uploaded pictures that shows the collar, color and the added disgusting sleeves. Ms.Witt"
1.0,"Weird material. Does not look like picture, and it's see thru!"
1.0,"Got these as party favors for a Muppet themed baby shower - and after a couple of minutes of playing (gently!!) with them - almost half of them broke - either the keychain fell/pulled off or the ""egg"" part squirted out an broke all over. What a waste of money!"
1.0,Good thing it was cheap the watch itself never worked
1.0,Terrible plastic smell. Could not wear
1.0,"I would give this five stars however after only 2 weeks of use, when I went to wind my watch this morning since it had stopped, the winder quit working. It winds the spring but there is no resistance anymore so when I let go it unwinds immediately...there is some sort of faulty mechanism inside the watch. It is an absolutely exquisite and tough watch on the outside and I had high hopes for it even considering the price!!! But even at that price the mechanisms inside should not be failing already. I hope that they replace it. If they do and the next one works great I will give this five stars. If it fails again with in a few days weeks or even months, I will have to give this a lower rating. I'll keep you all posted."
1.0,"A women's size large is like a kids 10/12 not kidding ! The set fits my 10 yr old.... don't buy , RUNNNNN<br /> Don't waste your money."
1.0,To tight at knees and the seams are horribly twisted.  The right seam is so twisted that it drops at the front of my foot. I did want to send them back but the shipping is $15. I don't know what I'm going to do with these pants but I won't even give them away. Definitely will never order something like this again online.
1.0,Bought these because I thought to myself why not try something new. Nah these just don't have enough room for everything. If I had to order again I would have easily gone up two more sizes.
1.0,I normally read reviews before purchasing anything on here but was in a rush to get this prior to vacation. The metal piece broke after just 3 days wearing it. This is not very good quality. I will be returning this product.
1.0,This is like a pancake. Too flat for an adult‚Äôs Head.
1.0,Way too small unfortunately
1.0,"Do not recommend these leggings!! Way to big, and the material is that cheap material, very see through. You can definitely find better quality, very disappointed cause they look cute in picture.<br />üí•üí•Get what you pay forüí•üí• This is it, quality stinks!"
1.0,ZEROOOO RATING. Wont even give one star. Its the worst bag i ever bought. CHEAPPPP flimsy material. Not the size i expected. On first use i cd see the zip looking like it would fall apart ifffff i only put heavy stuff. on second use well it was confirmed what a Pooooor product i bought because the strap started bursting. I would love my money back. Disappointed. never again.
1.0,The fabric is so thin and feels like swimsuit material. Sizing is off so I suggest sizing up if your going to buy. The design is definitely not as pictured and feels like a cheap iron on vinyl.
1.0,Bought this for my son. He wore it one time and the left arm in the back completely shredded. We are returning it this weekend.
1.0,The dress fits about 2 sizes smaller.And if you want to return it they charge you $6 shipping!!!
1.0,I didn't expect this chimney sized hat. The picture didn't make this clear.
1.0,The material is a scratchy polyester blend. It's more like a swimsuit material than a cotton t-shirt. Not breathable or comfortable.
1.0,Took almost 6 months to get here and its to small
1.0,The straps didn't even make it through the second week of school without ripping.
1.0,Garment came unraveled after hand washing the first time.<br />Do Not Waste Your Money On This Shirt!
1.0,It's a scarf.  That must be a pixie in the picture.  It's teeny tiny.
1.0,I've used this less than 6 months and it's discoloring. The silver is fading and turning cooper inside and out. The inside of the band turned my wrist green. I am not happy!
1.0,"These appear to be knock offs of the actual Bellingham glove company/LFS wondergrip gloves. I've purchased half a dozen over the last few years and love the real ones. These had Chinese writing on the label and do not match the actual gloves. Sizing is also WAY off. A large is equivalent to the real wondergrip gloves in size small. Therefore there is no way I can wear these. The gloves are not as flexible or as grippy as the real ones either.<br /><br />I checked the actual wondergrip online catalog and there is no such thing as a wondergrip ""aqua""."
1.0,Ugly orange color and no shape to the dress the material is super thin looks see through.  Very disappointed. Looks like a hospital gown.
1.0,Does not look like the picture. It looks cheap
1.0,"Used it twice and one of the braces broke, had to return."
1.0,"Very cheaply made shoes!  Nice look but no support, material super thin & stretches out after 1st wear..."
1.0,It runs super small and the beads all fell off.
1.0,These are NOT clip on earrings! My daughter could not wear them with the outfit we planned to wear them with for a modeling event!
1.0,Hats dont fit anyone!
1.0,Broke first time I wore them. So now I cant return as the one broke and fell off at work and I cant find it.
1.0,Ratchet mech broke after a couple of months. Belt does not last.
1.0,Really bad!
1.0,"Updated: Even less impressed! They reached out to me, after I attempted to post a bad review. They asked if they could fix the issue,  I happily responded, "" that would be great.... "" and then nothing from them.... for weeks, I reach out again... still no response.  So I guess they don't really want to fix the issue! Not impressed üò†. I've had this shirt for 2 months, and it is already coming apart at the seam? A very weird seam, that I can't fix by hand. I paid over $50 for this shirt and it's not worth $20, I've had shirts from Walmart last years? Of course it's made in china... so I guess I shouldn't expect much. Not happy the "" window "" of return has closed... they give you one month.  Don't waste your $50 on this cheap shirt."
1.0,"This came orange, not pink."
1.0,"They are cute, and that's all they have going for them. I bought size 16/18 US and that must been in children sizes because that's how small it is."
1.0,"Sending Back. These socks are Thin, very big in the foot area and super tight from the ankle on up. If you have bird legs swollen feet and love thin socks I would jump on these."
1.0,This product started falling apart in the first week. Don't waste your money on it
1.0,Stone fell out after 3 days of wearing!
1.0,"Description did not indicate that this was a woman's shirt, so of course it did not fit my teenage son:("
1.0,Loved the color combination. Have worn it now for a week but can‚Äôt  get the band to hold a secure  fit on my small wrist. The magnetic segments suggest it could be cut to provide a tighter fit. Searched the questions but appears it‚Äôs not an option. TOO BAD!! Hate it but will have to return.
1.0,I ordered by my bra size & still 2 small!
1.0,"creepy material, not comfortable"
1.0,"It was absolutely horrific. You can tell when you open the package that it's gonna suck. It doesn't look anything like the picture, is super cheap quality, doesn't fit well, and super difficult to figure out how to put on the pieces. You are better off making the costume yourself."
1.0,"Way too small, not for big boobs"
1.0,I ordered a 2xl it was more like a medium
1.0,Way too small! Not as wide as pictured either. Not worth the purchase!
1.0,Very poor quality. Was going to buy a couple more for the kids. Not worth it though. Logo was messed up in a few places. Will be returning it. Paid for shipping to get it here and have to pay for shipping to send back. Terrible.. will be posting this on all social media accounts. Don't buy from Powerdealz!
1.0,Cheap fabric..T length and I was hoping above the knee..so it look granny like
1.0,This dress looked like it wasn‚Äôt even finished being made. It looked like a tablecloth. I can‚Äôt even explain how bad it was. They did refund my money pretty quickly.
1.0,Not as described in the detail or in the photo.
1.0,The outfit was huge! Granddaughter couldn‚Äôt wear it at Halloween time because it being so huge
1.0,There were holes with fluff hanging out if this coat right out of the package! Save your money on this piece of garbage!
1.0,"Suction isn't great, leaks near my temples. Isn't compatible w/ a swim cap. Vision is clear, unobstructed, until water enters."
1.0,If you are going to be a figure skater - this is yours! I purchase really big and still this does not fit well - really?????
1.0,I can‚Äôt believe Cream would license such a poorly made product!
1.0,"Every single pair ripped on the seams after 1 wash,"
1.0,"They're way bigger than expected. Took up half my face!! The screws that hold the lenses on were missing so the lenses were just loose in the box. On a positive note, they're sturdy and very pretty."
1.0,"Received these as a gift.  Love the Eagles, hate these ugly, ugly shades.  Currently looking into how to return them."
1.0,The arm  ame lose after wearing them twice
1.0,You get what you pay for. They run very small. Bought two and neither fit.
1.0,"I don‚Äôt know if mine was mis-sized or if the measurements are horribly wrong.. but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 106lbs, size 36 bust and this dress was basically falling off of me.. IN AN XS!! The package said xs but there was no tag in the actual dress so I don‚Äôt know if they sent me the wrong size dress by accident. But according to my measurements, the XS should have been perfect. Oh well, would have been super cute! Sending it back."
1.0,"Es muy ancho, no le sirvi√≥ a mi hija"
1.0,LOVED these leggings but unfortunately they (both) did not last past the first wash. They both got holes in the inside seam :(  too bad because the compression waist band was super comfy. Oh well I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Bee keeps coming off
1.0,I ordered this dress larger than I needed too. It was several sizes too small. I was very disappointed in the sizing. The dress was very pretty.
1.0,"Foul odor and taste, these are complete junk and not sport masks. I only tried it on and couldn‚Äôt get the taste or smell out of my mouth for over an hour even after brushing my teeth."
1.0,"Awful material, basically see through, would never recommend buying"
1.0,It doesn‚Äôt seem to flatter me but I think the dress is very cute
1.0,This looked ridiculous. Horrible design. I returned it.
1.0,"Not true to size, very small"
1.0,totally deceptive..turned out to be a skin tight TEE SHIRT not a dress..fabric doesn't give but sssssssoooooo short also.... would NEVER buy again
1.0,Too tiny to get on ear.
1.0,"So cute in person! Looked forward to having a nice neutral shoe for my daughter, and the elastic broke on her very first time wearing them.  Disappointing, but I guess not unexpected for the price!"
1.0,Don't advise buying this item. I was expecting it to be a creamy white color when I received it it's a horrible dark yellow color and very cheaply made. But what can you expect for the price
1.0,"FOLLOW UP REVIEW. HEAVY PILING AFTER 3-4 WASHES. Had to throw away.<br /><br />I ordered two of these shirts, white and black. When I received the shirts I was overwhelmed by how big they looked but decided to go ahead and keep them to have a different style if tshirt  in my wardrobe.  I was pleasantly surprised how stylish and different the silhouette is.  I wore it with some denim shorts and gladiator sandals and I‚Äôve received several compliments.  If you want a new stylish T-shirt and a different oversized cool look this one‚Äôs for you.  The fabrics nice also. Good quality."
1.0,"A bought it couple days after wearing it the skin started to peal off so I stop wearing it actually threw it in the garbage, never again I will purchase this item"
1.0,After under 2 weeks the main back seam split open. Hardly wore them and was not even being rough with the boot. Also did not keep out any moisture. I bought these boots for my daughter to wear on the way to/from school so she could easily change into her shoes.
1.0,The paint on the ring wares off
1.0,I was hoping that I could wear this with a suit jacket and it look professional but the material just doesn't allow for it.  I returned the purchase.
1.0,The neckline was too high for my liking and therefor unflattering. I returned it.
1.0,Its cute but cheap. Very thin. Looks like a kids dress
1.0,"I ordered like 4 of these jumpsuits trying to dupe the FP hotshot. A few other brands come pretty close - this isn't one of them lol. Go for the ones with reviews, this pair is rough material - essentially like a cloth paper bag. Shapeless, but not in the cute oversized onesie way. More in the ""thrift shop reject"" way. Keep looking, this one ain't it"
1.0,"Dress arrived TORN, returning ASAP"
1.0,Legit plastic. Wtf. And ugly.
1.0,Not worth the price poor quality when i have the time i will return it
1.0,the dress was completely see-through
1.0,Too small. Would like a refund.
1.0,The plastic fitting piece broke as I adjusted it to wear for the first time. Never even got to wear it.
1.0,"Cheaply made, too small for &#34;one size fits all&#34; (I'm usually a medium and it was too small).<br />Really not a good item at all. Returned it."
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt stay closed. I won‚Äôt buy a product from this company again
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:41a1402f7a7a245db443c69905878eca]] The photo online showed a vivid red bucket hat with a plastic shield.  What I got was a dusty, faded red hat with no face shield to be found. I will not be keeping this product.  I‚Äôd give it 0 stars if I could.<br />Very disappointing."
1.0,This dress WAS so cute!!!!!! The seams are also stretching apart and show white.  I am petite and not stretching them lol.  The pillong is awful!  I have to throw it away now!
1.0,Not at all like pictured or described.
1.0,We received this band on Friday and on Monday morning it broke. See the pictures. Will be returning to amazon.
1.0,All three broke within the first day of wearing each
1.0,"I bought this belt to use fastened tightly to hold up some jeans that sit on my hips. The cinching has caused the top layer of the belt to split and tear away from the inner layer around the hole. I've only had the belt two days! If it does not tear through, I'm OK with using it as I usually have my top over it, but if it breaks completely, I will be back to downgrade my review.<br /><br />Came back and downgraded because belt wore through all layers. See photo. it's not solid leather. It only has a thin leather surface bonded to other material."
1.0,"The blender is junk. It never worked and since I want to use, now it‚Äôs to late to return. Please don‚Äôt buy this product."
1.0,material cheap
1.0,"what you see is NOT what you get. Not even close. You'll get remnant material from advertising campaigns of products that clearly were so badly advertised they went belly up.<br />There are no cool patterns, nothing that you would want to be seen in public with.<br /><br />I'm putting these out in a public grab bag for people who are desperate for a cover of any kind for free. It's what they are worth."
1.0,It looks greats but will break without notice.
1.0,"Not a sweater, made of T-shirt material"
1.0,"I love the color,  however the material was poor, it is a waste of money I threw them away, my worst buy ever"
1.0,dissatisfied with this purchase. Even if you stacked seven magnets together it would not stay. Kind of a waste. For those not looking to pierce their nose but are looking for alternative look elsewhere. I would not recommend buying a stud from here.
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt able to remove link to fit my small wrist
1.0,These are supposed to be 16 gauge but are a good bit bigger than that. I cant even use them.
1.0,The zipper and wristlet broke after one use. Not work the coast. This item did not hold up. I didn't even have much in it for it to fall apart like that.
1.0,Not true to size.  Must return!
1.0,"I purchased this Ted Baker purse for my Sister‚Äôs Birthday.<br /><br />I am very familiar with the Ted Baker products.<br />The purchase price was $69.00.<br />I can say; the quality of the purse is not a real Ted Baker.<br /><br />This is nothing but a Big Plastc Bag,with the Ted Baker name, that could have been purchased at the Dollar Store.<br />I am extremely disappointed in this purchase.<br /><br />Tammy Ansah-Yiadom"
1.0,"I was happy with the color. Until I wore them. They are see through, the material is cheap and ripped the first time I wore them. Not happy with this product at all"
1.0,"I ordered a size 12 in these ankle pants.  While the tummy fit well, the pants went all the way to my feet.  I expected them to come a bit above the ankle like in the picture."
1.0,"These were not ‚Äòskinny‚Äô pants. I know if they‚Äôre sizing is off you have to expect weird proportions, but these fit/were slightly baggy in the waste, then SO baggy in the butt, like, size down twice baggy. But the worst was they weren‚Äôt even skinny ankle at all. They were like straight leg/bootcut. And the fabric is weird."
1.0,"Your locking belt is not any good if the TSA opens your bag, and will then not reclose the belt.<br /><br />On a flight from Boston to Rio De Janeiro last week TSA opened my bag with this belt.<br /><br />When I got to Rio the belt was just hanging loose, but was not around the bag.  I suspect that it was just too hard for the TSA to hook back up.<br /><br />While this belt works very well, it is of NO VALUE if the TSA opens your bag, and will then not reconnect your bag.<br /><br />Therefore, I think you should pass on this belt."
1.0,It's cut funny. Not too big or too small just poorly made and weird fitting.
1.0,could have made this myself for pennies on the dollar.
1.0,It would have been nice if it was genuine leather. The organization is great.
1.0,Quality of the garment was bad and material
1.0,"Dress was used,torn extremely wrinkled and smelled, just horrible, plus sweat stains on underarm area"
1.0,They broke when I took off the back to put on.. You get what you pay for I guess..
1.0,I wear a medium normally may be a little larger in the waist but I ordered this in a two XL and it was still 5 inches to bring the waist band together. No Bueno
1.0,Strap broke off with two days.  Bad deal.
1.0,TOO SMALL ESPECIALLY IN THE BUST.
1.0,The seam is already torn/not finished. All I‚Äôve done is take it out of the bag. Have not even worn yet. Super concerned that after the first time I wash it it will just fall apart. But the fabric is super soft.
1.0,"This was cut so straight and narrow, I can't imagine it was for an adult."
1.0,"They are very weird on sizing, waist doesn‚Äôt fit and length is too tall so there‚Äôs no right size to get."
1.0,Waaaayyyyy to small and I got an XL the sizes are a joke sometimes on Amazon.
1.0,Solar power is worthless unless you are standing directly facing the sun and guess what? That's the last thing you want to do when it's 95 degrees.  Fan is so underpowered it makes no difference.
1.0,"I really liked the look of this bag, and was pleased when I first opened the package.  However, the zippers were stuck and the zipper pulls came off easily.  Some pliers fixed this problem.  The second time I used it, the hardware holding the handle on broke.  This bag is now in the garbage."
1.0,Very excited when I saw the package in the mail. Very disappointed when I opened it and found package of styluses.  Not sure if I should try to reorder or not
1.0,"This is not any part cotton - all spandex.  I bought &#34;new&#34; but there were stains in the arm pits and both tags were missing -- it was clearly used.<br /><br />Not worth the price.<br /><br />I do not have enough time before my performance to order a new costume - it is well-made, fit well (I sized up one size) and I was able to wash it. But not worth the price and clearly used.  Also, did not match the fabric description at all. 0% cotton.  Would not recommend buying from this seller."
1.0,It says adjustable band but its not. A little more snug than other bonnets so far
1.0,I cant review the quality of the item because following the standards they advertise this product is way to small.
1.0,"The lines don‚Äôt match up on the ‚Äúshorts‚Äù portion of the romper. I originally ordered the Medium and it was way too big, returned it. Ordered the Small.. it‚Äôs like one extreme to the next. But, the reason I‚Äôm returning this is not based on sizing.. it‚Äôs because the lines do not match up. And as you can see in the pictures, the back has some sort of flaw with design too. The material is super soft and I‚Äôm super bummed I‚Äôm returning this but it looks weird."
1.0,Originally ordered black and received red instead. The nose piece after a period of time fell off and was not comfortable at all. I would not recommend this product and to top it off the material was cheap and the elastic band that wraps around is not breathable so expect to sweat a lot.
1.0,The button doesn‚Äôt fit the bracelet I ordered with it. I guess there‚Äôs different sizes
1.0,Pretty but Extremely HEAVY earrings !!!
1.0,"The base itself is fine, comfortable and works.  They are cute and would work with many casual outfits.  And would be very good fun flip flop to wear.  BUT the thong portion is way too loose, dangerously so.  After the first hour or so, they are parked in my closet!  They are soo loose that you could slip out easily.  I would ship them back but it is not worth the effort.  Cheap is cheap for a reason."
1.0,"The bodice of this dress is very tight, making the lace very scratchy.  Also, the 'bra' was only stitched on one side, with the other loose and had to be placed.  Unable to wear because the bodice was so uncomfortable. :("
1.0,It sucks that the right hinge is so loose in the glasses...These are 5 Star sunglasses...THEY ARE REALLY COOL LOOKING!...very dark though...i thought they were a little lighter in shade...i tried tightening the screws but they were tight...something in the hinge in the arm loose?
1.0,"These are marketed as sweatpants but they are super thin and slick material, not thick and comfortable like they look on the website. Very disappointed. I probably won‚Äôt ever wear these."
1.0,"I was excited to get this shirt (mostly for the color). I ordered a Small (I'm 120lbs and 5'4), note that I routinely buy Medium shirts and wear them without a problem. This shirt was huge, I couldn't even pull it off as a ""large/comfy shirt."" I don't have anyone that size to give it to either.<br />It does say Small on the shirt but I highly doubt it. I also doubt it's female size as its very square and does not flatter female curves.<br />I don't recommend this purchase."
1.0,"Very cheep quality, the cut of the shirt is horrible. I highly don‚Äôt recommend"
1.0,These lenses are a waste of money. they did not fit in the glasses that they were made to fit.
1.0,The straps are not at all like pictures. Much cheaper material that is a bronze shiny material. Very disappointed.
1.0,Broke apart after 1 use.
1.0,"This bracelet isn't like the picture. I thought it was a metal piece designed to look like a lens... it's a sticker, and it wasn't even placed straight  :("
1.0,"Nothing like the picture!<br />It is an ugly brown, not red.<br />Very bad, cheap cut. Hangs unnatural.<br />It is straight down, absolutely no volume on the bottom like the picture.<br />Simply horrible. Luckly I was able to return."
1.0,I‚Äôve only been wearing this for a week and it‚Äôs already all discolored
1.0,Don't buy!  The quality is poor
1.0,You get what you pay for. The size is three times to small and quality looks like they made it in their garage. Just horrible.
1.0,"This suit is not recommended!  Poor quality, poor fit.  thumbs down!"
1.0,Loved the material and it was soft. However this ran small. Did not exchange for different size.
1.0,Bought this Link Bracelet for my boyfriend and it broke the next day! Very poor quality & Very Unsatisfied customers!
1.0,"The picture that was shown weren‚Äôt the shorts I received, the swoosh on the picture is going vertically while the ones I received the swoosh was horizontal. The Nike shorts are a completely different model of shorts."
1.0,The zipper broke already! Cheaply made for the price. Very disappointed in this product.
1.0,Hole in the knee after one basketball game. Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,I hate false advertising
1.0,This was way way tooo small and poor quality
1.0,Too tight even for grown kids.
1.0,"This is a CHEAP outfit that is WAY smaller than advertised. Was hoping to wear to Oktoberfest, but it was about 4 sizes too small. Material was cheap and the stitching wasn't really good."
1.0,It didn't show the karat on the chain it was listed on a piece of paper.
1.0,This jumper was sent without buttons to latch the straps to its bib.
1.0,Received the incorrect necklace
1.0,"when I opened the amazon box the first thing I noticed was that the plastic package that the romper was in had already been torn open. Then I take the romper out and notice that it‚Äôs is unzipped and the front is untied. It looks as if someone had opened it, tried it on, and then sent it back and the company just sent me the returned item. So by this point I‚Äôm disgusted.<br />Then I try it on and I see that the pattern is not the same as the one pictured. It is literally cut from a different cloth. Similar colors, but the placement of the gradient makes it seem like there are stains around the crotch area on my romper.<br />Outside of that it fit great, so I‚Äôm returning it and hopefully they send me an actual NEW unopened item where the color variation matches the photo above.<br />I will update this as soon as the new product arrives.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I sent back the old romper and received a new one in the mail today. The plastic wrapping was sealed, which was great, but I did notice familiar stains that someone in a previous review had complained about. I took pictures so you can see what they look like. It‚Äôs a cheaply made romper but it‚Äôs cute and fits well. However it‚Äôs clear that they don‚Äôt care about the quality of the product and they don‚Äôt mind sending stained or defective products out. I‚Äôm going to send this one back and get a refund."
1.0,broke soon as I put it on I loved it to ..
1.0,I ordered size 4T.  I received size Boys 10!  What a waste of time and money.
1.0,"Absolute garbage, out of the box they were bent in a couple different places. The materials are the most garbage plastic. DO NOT PURCHASE."
1.0,"This is NOT leather. Unfortunately, its a flimsy, poorly constructed waste of money. It felt as though the seams were going to fall apart. I have a hard time believing the positive reviews are genuine."
1.0,IS BROKEN AFTER 15 DAY
1.0,"Poorly made, the size of the shirt is not proportional, the neck is huge and definitely doesn‚Äôt fit like the picture they advertised. Terrible do not buy"
1.0,Upon opening the package these pretty soft socks had a big hole in one of them. Very disappointing.
1.0,I used the size chart. This was way too small. It could not reach past my thighs. If your size is according to the chart it maybe safer to go with XL
1.0,"At first, I was excited about ordering these padded shorts; they are made in the US. However, when the shorts arrived I tried them on (w/ underwear on) and was disappointed with this product. I feel as if they are inferior to other padded shorts that I bought. I did not like how the waistband went past my belly button, it kind of felt awkward. The legs felt fine but there are no grippers which could have the material ride up. Although, there could be a pro to that for some people. I know from experience that leg grippers leave marks and indents from long rides (+ 2 hours.) The part that I am most unsatisfied with is the chamois pad. You can see and feel the pad bunches up. When I was sitting on my bike I could feel the pad fold. The picture of the chamois looks nothing like the actual chamois which fooled me. I didn‚Äôt want to chance not being happy with these shorts so I returned it. Save your time and 5 dollars from returning this shorts and buy other shorts (I recommend Baleaf and Pearl Izumi.)"
1.0,Not what I expected. The charms weren‚Äôt the quality I wanted. They just didn‚Äôt work well for making bracelets.<br />I decided to return the wave  charms it was a HUGE pain. Not like normal amazon returns.  I couldn‚Äôt do an easy return at Kohl‚Äôs. I had to go to staples and print off a label since I don‚Äôt have a printer. When I went to send the package back the postage was not included. So I have to pay postage on a product I didn‚Äôt want.  Postage is higher then the product is worth.
1.0,Way too small. Sent back for a refund.
1.0,They are so fragile and easily brokeüò≠ The clips don‚Äôt even work either
1.0,"This is the only watchband I've purchased that I had to put the pins in the band before I could use it.  The first pin went in fine, the second one broke.  Since they did not provide any backup or replacement pins the band is now USELESS.  Waste of my money."
1.0,Fell apart into small pieces afte less than six months.
1.0,Super thin material and seam is pronounced.  Too large and arrived stretched out.  Other brands I ordered were like this one.
1.0,The bag zipper are cheaply made not worth the money at all
1.0,"I ordered this size hoping it would be perfect fit... However it is small enough to be a large hoodie on me.<br />My husband is 6'4"" and muscular. I am 4'11"" and tiny.<br /><br />I would have returned this had they allowed me to.<br /><br />Their customer service also ignored me after my initial request CANCELING my emails!"
1.0,"does not fit 5"" wrist, you cant loosen it to slide out of wrist unless you unbuckle it, but before you even attempt to do that, the magnet slips thru the loop and the watch drops on the ground before you know. do not buy"
1.0,"The charm is SO DARK you can NOT make out the it is a passport ..very disappointed It looks NOTHING like the picture .This is the FIRST one I have bought , out of about 10 that I don't like"
1.0,This is just a regular undershirt being marketed as compression shirt. Would definitely not recommend.
1.0,It should not have the description of compression.  They are loose.
1.0,El color parece desgastado y deste√±ido
1.0,The 2XL fits like a medium.
1.0,Broke within a few hours. Don‚Äôt recommend
1.0,"The dress was not made properly. The top had about 5 inches of extra fabric under each arm, which is unfortunate because I loved the pattern."
1.0,"SHOES HAD LITTLE SUPPORT, THEY SEEMED VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND FELT LIKE THEY WOULD FALL APART IF I WORE THEM."
1.0,The color of the hat advertised is not what I received. I was expecting a jean looking hat. What I got was a dark navy blue regular hat material. Very dissapointed.
1.0,It lost its pink color on the chain after wearing it 3 days. Cleaning didn‚Äôt help. The design is nice though.
1.0,"Title says most of it. The Hardware is simply okay but the software is incredibly awful. $150 for a piece of rubber and a battery that shocks you, but using it becomes a pain because you are forced to download and use Pavlok's proprietary app which functions significantly worse than the standard alarm app. Awful purchase, refunded."
1.0,Wore 7 or 8 times and elastic broke.  Beads everywhere.  Too expensive.
1.0,For menopause women the material is not great. I thought it was going to be soft textured.
1.0,The buckle color of the belt I got is inaccurate. It's just the same color as the belt making it bland and uninteresting.
1.0,"I ordered L/XL and they still took me 20 mins to get them on and with my hubby""s  help.  Not happy - giving to Goodwill."
1.0,It fits like xl I ordered 5xl narrow in the shoulders
1.0,"Looks cute on the model, right?  Whelp, not in person.  The small was WAY too big and baggy (I'm usually an XS, but there wasn't anything smaller).  I ordered the khaki and when I put it on, it looked like I took a burlap bag and cut out holes to wear.  Not cute at all - oversized and frumpy.  No thanks - I returned it."
1.0,Not at all as the picture
1.0,"SO disappointed! The material is absolutely not what it looks like in the picture. Now I have to pay the shipping, to send it back to the company. They were also extremely rude to me, when I inquired about my order, because it took forever to arrive."
1.0,Way too tight around the legs especially.
1.0,"Cheaply made Chinese crap was too small. When I washed them, they shrunk and became a trash item. Next time I buy hockey socks it will be from a reputable hockey gear website. Not Amazon."
1.0,"Fast shipping but not worth the buy, too small and they look fake and plastic, the diamonds are a yellowy color. My finger turned green within an hour as well."
1.0,I ordered an XL but I'm not sure what size I was sent because there wasn't a size label ln the item or its packaging.<br />Either way the item seemed to be at least 2 sizes too small.
1.0,This bracelet was too thin and is not worth buying.
1.0,Cheap material short belt ultra empire wait. Not as pictured even a little bit. 5ft 7 130 lbs ordered a medium .
1.0,Ordered  a six X too small.
1.0,"This dress looks waaaay different in person. I just tried it on. If you have ANY extra body fat or weight in your upper body, around your ribs and arms, it will show through the dress in a VERY unflattering way. If you are a super thin supermodel, you will rock this dress. Good luck."
1.0,LASTED ONLY 2 MONTHS AND STARTED COMING APART!
1.0,too small and they were damaged when they arrived
1.0,Looked something  from a bubble gum machine. Cheaply made.
1.0,At first I felt like I was in heaven --- that lasted about a week untill they weren't cushy soft on the bottom anymore. Then the pom pom kept coming undone and after two weeks of wearing I noticed the plastic sole had started unraveling from the slipper heel.  I don't think I need to say anything more.
1.0,Item does not work falls off is not elastic enough to stretch on anything complete waste of money
1.0,Great fit but scratched my prescription eyeglasses which will need to be replaced. Clip on part works well but they need a frame around lens
1.0,"Dress is too tight in the arms and chest area. Length is perfect but it doesn‚Äôt look like how it looks in the picture when you try it on and it feels like Halloween costume material. Lol. Kind of disappointing, it‚Äôs not a horrible dress but it isn‚Äôt exact either."
1.0,Way too small like a med or lg
1.0,Cheap...broke after three uses
1.0,Very tacking
1.0,The one good thing about this dress is the length.  I'm 5'6&#34; and the dress went all the way down to the floor.  I love longer length maxi dresses.  The down side of this dress is the fabric. The material is very cheap feeling and very see through.  Don't waste your time ordering and returning this dress.
1.0,"shrink fast, threading was falling apart"
1.0,Too small or tight
1.0,"I personally wouldn't buy ANYTHING from Portacell<br /><br />In my experience, all the products I have purchased from them have failed within weeks/months<br /><br />Two computer chargers sparked when plugged into an ordinary outlet, heated up the battery excessively (probably lessening life), and even damaged a WIFI card through the unregulated motherboard voltage<br /><br />You can attempt to return these defective items at your own expense.  They claim you sent them the wrong part or that the part works just fine  Good luck in getting a replacement"
1.0,"It looks too small. I'm not allergic to acrylic, but I expected cotton, as advertised. I have acrylic hats already. It was smelly as well."
1.0,Item way too small even though they suggest double 1XI got the 3Xl and it‚Äôs still too small
1.0,This dress is soft and beautiful but‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a high waisted dress. (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù 128 lbs) The waist line is 2 inches higher than my waist and the length is 3 inches higher than my knees. So strange‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a medium but does not fit length wise in the two areas.
1.0,The item was to small asked to return and refund. Got nothing!!! Will not order again from here
1.0,The seams are coming apart after only  a  week !
1.0,Grand daughter thought they were junk and odd.
1.0,Fits well just material is a lint n pet hair magnet! Annoying but nice. Material is a little thin as well
1.0,Very poor quality. Uneven sewing. Can‚Äôt imagine it would wash well. Will not waste my time trying to save a few bucks anymore on these type of brands.
1.0,After only 3 times wearing the left shoe stop working my daughter was so exited at first now she is heart broken.
1.0,Glasses still fog over with a mask
1.0,"Nice design, BUT.....not rubber piece on the inside brace so as to avoid scratching the inside of the RX lens."
1.0,"There is no pink in the ""pink sand"" color, it's beige. Returning."
1.0,I sent it back.  No numbers on the face.
1.0,One of the pins wasn‚Äôt even full length of the bracelet and the thing fell apart and onto the ground which dented the stainless and then chipped the sapphire lens. Total waste of money. And of course no recourse because it‚Äôs from a third party vendor.
1.0,This was a horrible purchase. The sleeves don‚Äôt look like the photo and the mid area was just a huge piece of rag.
1.0,One of them fell on on day one and it‚Äôs too big and does not fit well.

1.0,Zero support. The top has no support or lining.
1.0,Way to thin and Janket super long and I‚Äôm Tall.
1.0,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP! LOOKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN PICTURED. LOOKS RUSTY & OLD &: DEFINITELY TOO SMALL (A BABY'S NECKLACE)! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND DEFINITELY YOUR TIME..... I WAITED ALMOST 2 MONTHS FOR THIS TRASH! TO BE HONEST IT DON'T DESERVE ANY STARS!!!! JUST GAVE IT 1 TO LET YALL KNOW ABOUT IT! VERY DISSATISFIED
1.0,Ped√≠ L y me yego xxl
1.0,Colors were different in person.  Returned item.
1.0,"This is just a no all around. It doesn‚Äôt fit, the fabric is absolutely see through, and fits more like maternity pants would. 0/10 would not recommend"
1.0,This was supposed to be a size fits all set but instead I received a size that was similar to a kids small. Was not worth it and ended up returning.
1.0,"Barely fit before washing and I have a size 10.5 (US) foot,after washing no way it was going to fit"

1.0,"I was disappointed because the earrings were not 100% sterling silver, only the backs were."
1.0,"It was too small by at least two sizes. It is a mini skirt, like an adult store clothing mini skirt which is what I wanted for Halloween, but it does not fit at all per their sizing."
1.0,In the description it said mirrored pc lens.  When we got it it was cleared.  My daughter needed one so she decided to keep it.

1.0,Made no difference.
1.0,I believe I've been fat shamed.  Sent back.
1.0,Super cheap looking fabric and design! Very disappointed
1.0,"The item was listed as being made of 70% linen, 30% cotton.  The shirt that came was 100% polyester.  Buyer beware."
1.0,"Quality seems good enough, but did not get what was ordered. The black grid matched my luggage, the white grid didn't."
1.0,The made the product well but the sizing is Asian size. This is not US sizing.  If you are a size 16 or bigger don‚Äôt bother purchasing. I sent mine back
1.0,These are not a proper fit to size. If u are a medium I suggest getting a large. Was very disappointed to not be able to comfortably wear these.
1.0,worst grillz to order .... too big and make your mouth look huge
1.0,Unable to use as sizing description inaccurate
1.0,"The dress the little girl is wearing is not the dress you will receive. The dress is not floor length, the ruffle around the waist is material not tulle. It frumpy and not the ‚ÄúPageant dress as described!‚Äù Very disappointed."
1.0,"All too big to pass as nose jewelry, painful to wear, and absolutely ugly. I was so disappointed. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"Loved this tote bag, but the strap broke way too soon for this price.  Now, I can only use the bag by the handles.  I am very disappointed.  Look elsewhere if you need a durable shoulder bag."
1.0,"Adorable product, but the package was missing items. Gave it to a Bee lover as a gift, and how embarrassing, they noticed a Bee earring missing!!"
1.0,"It's basically just a very tight very stretchy shirt. The images show blue things like they have something in the shirt. Nope. Just stitching that makes it look different, still just a shirt."
1.0,Sizes are smaller than advertised
1.0,"Trashy looking, very thin material, isn't worth it. Don't waste your money. Very bad option....do not buy it it's not worth it."
1.0,"Pure junk. It broke on the first use and mind you, this is not a heavy-use item."
1.0,Too small! It's hard to even see the dolphins and their eyes are not black as it shows here.
1.0,Doesn't fit the watch that I ordered it for.
1.0,Print was nice - this could have been a good dress however measurements were off (very tight in bust and hip area) even though I ordered larger size. The item was repackaged (new bag over open old bag) and belt was missing.
1.0,"I wanted a mask/ gaiter with a replaceable filter. This fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />The problem is that it's too tight, so when you speak your lips are compressed hard against the material of the mask, making your lips unable to move in the proper ways to form the sounds you need to communicate."
1.0,I got two non-matching barefoot sandals.  This one came paired with the susenstone womens beach imitation pearl one.
1.0,"I was so mad when I pulled these earrings out of the envelope and saw that not only is there NO pink whatsoever in the color of the stones (you can see from the picture I attached that they're actually whitish/clear), but the color of the metal is definitely gold and not rose-gold and there are spots of tarnish here and there.  They don't look well-made.  The picture definitely doesn't match the actual product.  I sent them back immediately."
1.0,The sleeves were way too long and way to big around. Too bad. I love the fabric and would have purchased multiples.
1.0,Received the wrong color I ordered silver polarized and received a blue color. They at least fit my frame. I'm leaving out of the country so can't return them and receive what I originally ordered on time.
1.0,"I was in the house, I received the notification and opened the door, there was my empty prime bag!"
1.0,"Not only does the watch not keep an accurate time, but the band consistently falls breaks off because the pieces that keep the band together are too small. I would really appreciate a refund or for the company to contact me to make it right. This is a great looking watch, but serves me no purpose if I can‚Äôt wear it or tell time with it..."
1.0,"The small fit like a large. Cute top, poor & inaccurate sizing."
1.0,Fabric is definitely not what I expected and completely see thru
1.0,Masks are stupid. They don‚Äôt work.
1.0,"This is my first ring to try and I after minor trouble getting it in and closing it, I loved it. It was great. Until nearly 24 hours of wearing it, my nose started hurting. I cleaned it and turned it and everything. An hour later it was still hurting and was getting worse. Eventually it got pusy and red and inflamed. I had went to a water park so I thought the chlorinated water was what aggravating it. Come to find out it was the metal of the hoop I was allergic to. I know this is a me problem but I don't think this product it actually surgical steel because the stud that I've had in it surgical steel and it hasn't been bothering it at all."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt waste your time. This watch advertised as: Includes all documents, TAGs, booklets and storage/display box. Unfortunately, it arrive in plastic bubble wrap. No documents. No tags. No booklets. No display box. Scratches on the band as if it is a used watch. I‚Äôm so disappointed. This was a birthday gift for my husband. Now what am I supposed to do?!? It has been returned."
1.0,"Goofy inner frame  is bright blue color, ugly and distracting"
1.0,"The product arrived on time, unfortunately the wig was tangled and had a big knot at the top of the wig! I have purchased products before from this company and items were very nice, but this wig was very poor quality."
1.0,I do not recommend buying this coat. The quality was poor and also the cut.
1.0,They broke three days after receiving them.  Very poorly made and I do not recommend purchasing these glasses.  Had to give it a one star but I wouldn't even give it one star.
1.0,"The fabric is different than how it looks on the picture. It‚Äôs not as soft. The sizes also run very small. I‚Äôm a large, ordered an extra large, and it was still super tight."
1.0,I do believe that if I would sneeze this would be long gone!<br /><br />This is the tiniest little charm for $22 that I've ever seen!<br />Very dissatisfied!
1.0,"When I bought a pair of earrings, one pearl came off in a couple of days. The vendor replaced the set quickly. A couple of months later once again a pearl came off and when I contacted the vendor I received no response. When I decided to glue it myself, I saw there was some coating on the pearl near the hole and thought it must be old adhesive. When I scraped it off, I found that the coating just kept going and was actually a pearlescent coating, which shouldn't be necessary on a real pearl.."
1.0,La tela raspa y no estira
1.0,Very disappointed! Bought this dress for my birthday and part of the good sequins are missing on one side and the gold pattern doesn‚Äôt match up.  Will be returning.
1.0,This has to be for an child
1.0,"Do not like, was not a formal cocktail dress at all to my taste. Made of stretchy cotton material. Its a very casual dress in my opinion."
1.0,"No stretch, couldn't even try on."
1.0,Variation in guage non existent. Not all are interchangeable. A lot of the same. As in half dozen of each basic design and same guage.<br />Horrible
1.0,"Nothing like what's shown. Sizing is way off, material is horrible and the style is crap. I thought because it was on prime it wouldn't have been a rip off but it is. It's straight from China."
1.0,"I really wanted to like these. But even with my 8 year old‚Äôs very small head, the holes for the ears didn‚Äôt even come close to being where they should‚Äôve been. His ears were both bent forward when he wore it with his ears in the holes. It just was manufactured very poorly. If they simply changed the design it would make a world of a difference. Fabric and print were fine, but we can‚Äôt even use them. I had everyone in the family try it on all the way from age 4 up to my husband. It doesn‚Äôt fit anyone."
1.0,"Too expensive, even after discount."
1.0,Not 2‚Äù as advertised and doesn‚Äôt lock as described.
1.0,Waited too late to try them out. Doesn't fit my watch. Now I can't return.  Up yours Bezos.
1.0,Clasp broke after the second day. Looks great but cheaply made.
1.0,bags funny.  cheap materials.  unflattering in general and doesn‚Äôt look like the picture
1.0,Not happy at all it was way too big.
1.0,"This shirt runs about 2 sizes small.  I was given a month long delivery time frame, but the shirt arrived after the time frame.  I tried it in to find out it was too small.  When I tried to return it, it said the return window had expired.  It expired 2 days after I finally received the shirt. I have contacted the seller, and it said it may take them 2 days to respond.  I still have not heard from them."
1.0,Too small and only gave a partial refund. It came with tags from Walmart that it was originally bought for $7.99.
1.0,"The clear, heart-shaped pair of earrings arrived broken. I couldn‚Äôt even find the other half in the bag. The heart and star shapes are barely discernible. Would not recommend."
1.0,The arms of the sunglasses were described as being white. They were actually chrome. $20 wasted.
1.0,Definitely  not a 2xx. Was shipped  from china. Not made for  robust american
1.0,The dress arrived after the wedding<br />But it‚Äôs here now
1.0,El vestido con muchas arrugas y en mal estado
1.0,It‚Äôs not as described. It‚Äôs over my knee and doesn‚Äôt look as picture.
1.0,I love the design the idea was cute but poorly made. The fabric is thin and see through. And the buttons look sloppy. Not to meant when I tried to get help from the company because it was not what I expected and for the prive I expected more they made up dumb excuses and told me they could only give me 10% of my money back. These people sell crappy products and when you tell them whats wrong they con you out of your money. Thoroughly dissappointed.
1.0,Product was way too hot to wear in Florida. Too much sweat for it to continue to do any good just when walking.
1.0,Thess are horrible cheap material that run small and show every single dimple you have. Dont waste your money
1.0,I lost my fitbit wearing these bands.  They look & feel good but come undone easily.
1.0,Tried to remove the tag and the sweater ripped
1.0,This band is too wide leaving sharp little corner sticking out on each side
1.0,I lost two lipsticks from these Chapstick keychain holders. They slip right out. Don‚Äôt buy!
1.0,Item had the seems come apart on sleeves. Looks like it wasn‚Äôt inspected for quality and just thrown together. I guess that‚Äôs what you get when it comes from China.
1.0,"I tracked my product from start to... finish? I hesitate because the product never made it to me (it has been a month now). As i said i tracked it, but it made it to my city and was returned  to sender. This is without my authorization as far as I know. Needless to say, I was very upset and filed a claim yesterday. I await an answer.<br /><br />I have gotten other bracelets though, and they came on time and exactly as described. So, buy with caution."
1.0,"Got to wear it once before it shrank in the WASHER not dryer. Washed on warm. Prior to washing it I would tell you it was ok in design. Not best quality although soft, and shoulders are tight. I‚Äôm a true to size medium and ordered a medium. Huge in body. Right across back and sleeves"
1.0,So transparent see all my underwear
1.0,"This sweater was very poor quality, thin, not well proportioned in design. Waa more like a cheap product you get at a garage sell or swap meet."
1.0,Definitely not stainless steel throughout. The top coating on the buckle came off and made me turn green.
1.0,The size was too small.  It must not have been US measurements.
1.0,"These earrings are TINY - like they are sized for a baby. I wish I had taken a look before I gave them as a gift. I thought they would be small, like a half inch in diameter - they are probably 3/8&#34; in diameter, and for $44. My daugher (29) was gracious and insisted they were &#34;perfect&#34; but I know she was being gracious. Get them for a baby but don't get them for a teen or an adult."
1.0,"Nothing like in the picture, to big on top, to much fabric around waist."
1.0,sucks. do not recommend this product. size is wrong and the adhesive does not stick on.
1.0,"These were poorly shaped. They were too large to fit comfortably in an adult mouth or a teen's mouth (barely possible to get your lips over the outside. They also are weird (3 front teeth?!). My daughter wanted them for some sort of costume, but they're essentially unusable. Not worth the money, even as a party favor."
1.0,"completely awful for what I was trying to use it for. cheaply made, scratchy & hot. but it might fit your needs depending on what you‚Äôre using it for."
1.0,This did not work and I don‚Äôt know how to reach the seller. I would like a replacement or a refund.
1.0,These were cute cuff links that I bought as a present for my husband. He wore them twice and one broke so they weren‚Äôt well made.
1.0,"The arm pit holes were too big. It was cute, but just not a sexy fit at all."
1.0,"These shorts are awful. The material is completely not what I expected, the shorts themselves are incredibly wrinkly, and I can't imagine a person they would look good on. Awful"
1.0,"I bought this from the warner bros studio tour in London for 50¬£ which is upwards of $60 and it was a complete rip off, the foot steps are not at all realistic in the sound or the way that they light up. I had been wanting to buy this since I saw it at universal Orlando and I have to say I was extremely dissapointed when I finally got it. I would recommend this for kids under the age of 5 but nobody who isn‚Äôt impressed by worthless lights and annoying noises."
1.0,I bought these in a size 2 xl because I wanted them big. When I received them they were a size medium. I got hole of the company and the chastised me for not checking out the sizing chart which I did. The company is based in China. The return address for returns is also China. Either way I am out money and have a pair of overalls that don't fit. I will never buy from this company.
1.0,"This felt more like a fishing net than a sweater, work cover up.... I washed it to see if that helped but I ended up just tossing it. :("
1.0,Size is way off. Bought an XL and it was more like a medium.
1.0,"Nothing at all like pictured lol, came folded up in an envelope the size of your average wallet. Everyone else seems to have gotten the rite product. This is totally not it."
1.0,It is very flimsy and broke after a half day of use. DO NOT WASTE your money. Look at the claspin my pics. It bent on one and the other fell off.
1.0,"I received it broken, nothing like the picture."
1.0,"I am not impressed with this screen protector. I installed the cover following the directions, very easy to do with no bubbles. Within a couple of hours it just popped right off. I immediately stuck it back on, which seemed to work, but the edges of my phone no longer were sensitive to touch. I pulled it off and am fairly certain the cover is not tempered glass as stated. It looks and feels like plastic. Hopefully I can get my money back per their lifetime warranty."
1.0,"After a few washes the fabric is coming undone. Very cute and comfortable, but the stitching doesn‚Äôt hold up."
1.0,"This top went straight into the trash. It looks really nice on the picture, but in reality the knot in the middle is a hole in the material with a small band pulling it together. The band doesn't manage to cover the hole, so you can see the person's bare skin. That's unacceptable."
1.0,I placed an order for 2 packages for both of my daughters.  I thought I was getting 8 pairs for each of them but only received 4 pair box.  I am not sure if this was a shipping/packaging error or a description error.  The stones are also so small you can barely see them.  I am returning them.
1.0,"The material was terrible, the shirts fit weird, the seems are all messed up."
1.0,I did not notice until after I washed the item (making it not returnable) the TAG is on the outside of the onesie.... I am going to try to remove without ruining the onesie but I don‚Äôt know how. Very disappointing. My husband was excited to get this in the mail for our baby girl.
1.0,Runs small!! Very thin material under the buttock area!!
1.0,"This product does not have the 925 stamp, not sure if silver"
1.0,None of the backs fit the earrings. A few of the backs had no hole drilled in it.
1.0,This was definitely not what was expected. Delivery took a long time and discovered this was coming from China. The fabric was cheap and thin. Tried to return and it was going to cost more in shipping. Not a huge loss but would not recommend buying. There are better products out there.
1.0,"It‚Äôs broken.  We thought it was the batteries so we bought new batteries but even the new batteries won‚Äôt get it to light up.  Too close to Halloween to worry about the return and rebuying it.  So we kept it,  but it‚Äôs disappointing and definitely NOT worth the money."
1.0,The quality of the fabric is very poor. One wash and color faded and the rim of the pants pulled out. See pictures for more details. Not a buy at all for anyone. Plus it is so expensive. Not worth the buy.
1.0,Returned this item. Not appeared as it did in picture.
1.0,"In addition to missing the necklace, this set is a set of earrings that is mismatched: one pearl has a flat top. It looks terrible. I did the best I could to take a photo of the flat pearl (on the left) which has a pin poke hole in it.<br /><br />So it‚Äôs missing the necklace, despite being sold as a necklace and earring set, and one of the earrings I think is totally unwearable. The round pearl looks great and has nice luster, but I‚Äôm not going to risk buying again.<br /><br />I‚Äôm now the second person who didn‚Äôt get a necklace who also had one earring that was flat while the other round.<br /><br />These will be returned."
1.0,Looked fake and not very well made.. Did not like this size. returned.
1.0,Fit poorly. Disappointed
1.0,"Was looking for a true ""squat proof"" legging and this was not it... unfortunately!  Had to return."
1.0,no way these are an extra large.
1.0,Looked so pretty in the photo. Cheaply made and looks like it came from a bubble gum machine.
1.0,"Muy peque√±a en la foto luce mas grande y de mejor calidad, me decepcione cuando la vi."
1.0,Very bad quality.. total waste of money
1.0,the dress was not as the picture. it had a few different structures on certain parts. but the material was sooo cheep. I took a chance on this one and it was not a winner. i would not recommend this item at all. if you do buy at your own risk.
1.0,"Awful. The magnet seem to be strong, but went walking constantly came undone. Threw them away, what a waste if money."
1.0,"I was very excited to receive this dress. I received one three sizes too small. Overall, the quality for the price was subpar."
1.0,Only fits if you have little to no chest
1.0,I bought this for my teenage daughter.  I thought I would give to her for Christmas.  It's very cheaply made and not pretty!  Even the give box was bad.  It was so bad I did not give it to her.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
1.0,Cute dress. Arms are too small for me. I ordered the largest size possible. I will return.
1.0,This earring is crap! Turned black on the first wear!!! Poor material üò¢
1.0,"I got acrylic plugs, NOT glass as described. That was when I should have known to return them, but I liked them so much I figured I would just keep them and it wouldn't be an issue. I've had my ears stretched for a good 15 years to 00g and they were loose, but again, they stayed put for the most part so I wasn't overly concerned. I have never ever had any problem with any type of plug I've used - glass, plastic, wood, etc., but after two days of wearing these my ears were so sore I could barely touch them. My skin was an angry red and the swelling was unbearable. I couldn't put saddle plugs in because of the swelling, so I put my regular stainless steel screw ons back in and four days later my lobes are back to normal. I have already contacted Amazon, there is no way I'm paying for these, especially when I was lied to about the material. I'm so sad too because they were unbelievably pretty. Other reviewers mention they got glass, so I'm not sure why I received something different, but be warned."
1.0,"I wanted to get these to replace a pair I have that are very similar, however the ones that came were totally different design that what is pictured. Seems like a lot of people have said the same thing. They should probably just take these down from the site. Buyer beware."
1.0,Broken pair
1.0,This purse is adorable and I would have loved it.  I happened to get the black one with the roses.  But the first time I used it the clasp fell off.  As it is metal there was no way for me to fix it.  The web site said to let them know if there was a problem rather than leave a bad review.  But they did not respond after I left them a message.
1.0,Couldn't even use due to not enough spacing with the cross in the middle. Couldn't get in both sides.
1.0,"Pretty dress, but it is sized about three sizes too small."
1.0,Too much material in the front.
1.0,"Idea is wonderful!<br />Only wore it twice after my surgery, as it began to pill.<br />Very Disappointed"
1.0,"Very poor quality, broke second day I used it."
1.0,"This one is very short. Also, the hemline was noticeably uneven (much longer on the left than on the right) and there was a weird extra bunch of fabric on the right around the zipper. Not impressed..."
1.0,This bag is cheap quality. Not enough compartments and the zippers are cheap.
1.0,"Really small, its a choker unless youre super skinny."
1.0,"Terrible quality. The posts bent as soon as I tried to put the backs on them, and I say tried because the backs would not go on because the holes were to small."
1.0,Would do zero stars if I could. In each pair one sock is like half the size of the other. Looks so stupid because then their not the same length and the smaller one is too tight. I would return but I already washed them :(
1.0,These are the worst goggles I‚Äôve ever purchased. They broke and separated as I was adjusting to use them on my first use. Never even made it into the water with them!
1.0,"This was very cheap, see through material. But what was worse was the top size. I ordered large and it barely covered my chest and bra. If you are larger than a B cup it wouldnt fit."
1.0,When got this dress it was see throughand couldn't find a slip to wear under it as we needed to wear it the next day
1.0,These shoes didn't even come in a box. They are so cheaply made and are three sizes too big!
1.0,"I cannot believe that I did not see the reviews before buying this dress. For starters, I saw the picture and did not realize that it was an asian product, if I had known I'd have never bought it! I think it's very cheap not to specify this given that american and asian sizes are so different. Secondly, I ordered the biggest size available as well probably expecting at least that it'd be like a normal Large size even though I ordered an XL. I did make a mistake not seeing the reviews though because this is the worst I've ever seen on amazon before. Honestly, the fabric is terrible I mean it just looks andddd feels very cheap. The top of the dress feels extremely cheap, I ordered a size XL and it felt and fit like an S-M for an adult. I was extremely surprised because the tag did say it was supposedly XL but the dress did not stretch at all and I could not even put it on because it just didn't fit at all! The dress colours are not too bad to be honest I mean it was like the picture in that aspect at least I cannot complain but all the rest was pretty terrible :( Now, since I didn't read the reviews I also had no idea I could not return it and now I'm stuck with a way too small dress that I'd honestly also never wear because of the cheap fabric. :s"
1.0,"Love the product but when I opened package there was only 1 pair, what happened to other 2? Description says 3 pair."
1.0,I wish I could give this 0 stars. First time I tired it on this is what happened. Don't waste your money.
1.0,These are for girls not ladies
1.0,very wrong size..it will not fit any adult unless they have a teenager' s build and figure.
1.0,"The sizing is way off, went up to an XXL for an oversized look. Can‚Äôt even get my arm in it. Beautifully made, but doesn‚Äôt fit."
1.0,cheaply made. stained my hands all black installing the band. paint came right off. do not buy
1.0,"It lasted LESS THAN ONE WEEK. I wrote a good review two days after I received it, but it broke three days after. DO NOT BUY unless you like to waste your money."
1.0,Arm holes are loose and look weird
1.0,Everything I didn't want.
1.0,"This mask is EXTREMELY thick, even without the inserts. The adjustable straps broke almost immediately. Good for looks, not for efficiency"
1.0,Very thin shirt.
1.0,The hooks are different size some are of shapes that don‚Äôt match
1.0,"I wanted to use this for a nurse Halloween costume.  When I received it, it was bent and the cap of the syringe was broken.  It looks cheap.  I trashed it."
1.0,"Ordered S in light khaki, fit like an XS which is what I wanted, but arrived with two buttons popped off and it was a purple color rather than the light orange/tan that I wanted. Returned."
1.0,I am not able to use this band because it is either constantly falling off at the hinge or it is snagging all of my clothes.
1.0,"These neck gaiter are huge!! They dont fit me or my husband and hes got a big ass head lol the carbon filters are kind of pointless, even if these fit correctly the filters only cover the mouth and not the nose. All 3 came with loose threads and are poorly sewn together. Seriously....just get a different brand. The only good thing about these are the colors."
1.0,Save your money. Entirely too large.
1.0,Only received one pair of tights. Item description says it comes with two pairs
1.0,This shirt made for a really good laugh!! I‚Äôm not a small girl but I wear off the shoulder shirts a lot...this shirt was a puzzle to figure out! The design is ridiculous and was not off the shoulder unless I pulled the entire sleeve off my arm.
1.0,Very cheap material! The color rubbed off within days and the inside came unglued from the outside layer.
1.0,"I am not happy.  Size was to fit up to 150 pounds, My granddaughter weighs 110 and these cut her into at the waist. Hate it as it was some of her Christmas."
1.0,"Hated these pants, I order a medium first fit was all wrong on me, so I went down to a small... same thing fit was still all wrong. Disappointed because I really liked the feel and design of these pants."
1.0,"I was not able to fit these plastic post in my ears.  I tried putting the protectors in the holes first, then sliding the ear ring through,  but no luck that way either. I was hopefully that this would be my answer for wearing ear rings with allergies but they did not work for me :("
1.0,Ordered for my 4t granddaughter. Couldn't even try it on as it was so small. Buy at least 2 or 3 sizes larger than the child fits in.
1.0,Broke when I tried putting one on
1.0,"I purchased two of these shirts, both of them the same size, in two different colors. One fit true to size (the green one) and the other one, the pink was super tight. Also, the color in the picture is more like a blush, baby pink. What I received however, was like a bubble gum pink. I returned it immediately."
1.0,It was very poor fabric and did not look anything like the photos on Amazon.
1.0,Don't buy! Terrible quality on the lace part- looks super cheap and seller will not let me return it.
1.0,"These boxers are a disappointment. They are smaller in size by their design. I'm a medium with a 34 waist and these feel small. I ordered them because they are 95% cotton and cotton is cooler to me. Not these boxers however, they are hot, tight, and generally uncomfortable. Not worth ordering."
1.0,Swimsuit fits fine but there is NO LINING!! So you can either paint yourself in purple body paint or buy this swimsuit.
1.0,My son loves the nike hyper elite quarter socks... these were much tighter and very hard to get on
1.0,I give this trying to say one only because it is not true to size I ordered my correct size based on the comments this was a terrible fit and a waste of time
1.0,The straw was broken in several areas. They are cheaply made. You can find better quality at Walmart. I would have returned but it wasn't worth my time.
1.0,The shippers size was bigger than it said
1.0,"Love the style, especially the pockets, not the fabric"
1.0,This is a cute jumpsuit but it runs very big
1.0,I‚Äôm a about a size 10. Looks like a moo moo but I‚Äôm sure on a thin person it would be nice. Fabric is cheap and not soft at all
1.0,These sweatpants were extremely big. I ordered a small and they looked like a size large to me. The material is pretty cheap also. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these.
1.0,"Overall nice product, but the loop to pull them on broke with in the first few wears."
1.0,Tiny and not as pretty as shown
1.0,"Although it is stated on the amazon site as being ‚ÄúGenuine Leather‚Äù it is not.<br /> I have owned leather wallets for decades and this wallet is definitely not leather. If it doesn‚Äôt smell like leather, feel like leather, or says leather on the wallet, it is NOT leather. It feels like and smells like plastic and chemicals. I‚Äôm very disappointed."
1.0,"This was way way small.  If your are small enough to get into it and close it, then you don't really need to be wearing one of these."
1.0,"Very thin and not made very well. Cheep material. Also, the size is not true. Returning."
1.0,I was really bummed. It took 8 weeks to get it and then the top was tiny! I won't order anything from this site again.
1.0,I got a 3x solely because of the reviews but when the dress was delivered it was absolutely HORRIBLE DEFINITELY WILL BE RETURNING
1.0,I'm FURIOUS. I thought it looked ok and felt ok until I picked it up and noticed that there's already a stitch/rip in the shoulder area. It's already coming apart and I haven't even worn it yet! Horrid quality!!!
1.0,"Material was of poor quality, sleeves very long and poufy. I replaced this in the bag and processed a return within minutes of receipt."
1.0,"Very sheer and runs very small. Purchased xs for my 5‚Äô2 120lb daughter and it looked small enough to fit an 8 year old, yet you can easily see through both layers of fabric when held up to the light on a hanger."
1.0,The shirt was way too small bought a xl. I believe it's made for girls not women.
1.0,"Does not keep cold air out OR warm air in, besides looking ridiculous."
1.0,it was way to large
1.0,Way too small. Doesn‚Äôt even come close to fitting even on the last setting. Now what do I do with it. Maybe I can keep it in my pocket??????
1.0,"I am MAD! This thing was like my dream to own, and when I got it, it was like squeezed together, and when I tried to put it on, it snapped right in half. It's all dinged up and scratched."
1.0,"Only one shoes lights worked, even after charging a whole day,  the other had 2 lights out. They are ridiculously bright though. Liked that they were rechargeable but wonder what happens when the plug in part gets wet."
1.0,I'm a curvy hour glass.  I usually buy pearl izumi jerseys in a XXL.  This is not a women's cut.  It was a man's cut.  The arms were huge and the hips were too tight.
1.0,"i have a 34 inch waist and ordered an XXL  it was extremely tight, could not wear it."
1.0,There's not really any area that you can see clearly through these I've had multifocal of other brands that are wonderful but this one they're not even usable
1.0,These were way too big in size for me!
1.0,Cheap.  The lenses hurt your eyes.  Not worth trying to save a few bucks.
1.0,Cheap fabric üòî
1.0,These are cheap polypro-china crap. Thanks for deceiving me Amazombies...
1.0,I am 5'11&#34; and this was way too short. It barely covered my toosh! I returned it.
1.0,"I order L/XL,why did I receive 3 S/M and 3 L/XL I‚Äôm not happy about this,I alright use one of the sock I would like to return the other size  that I didn‚Äôt use for the correct size"
1.0,Junk.  Smudges on face under glass.
1.0,Loved the color and style but the top of the boot rubbed against my leg when I walked
1.0,"Admittedly my son is rough on shoes, as are most 8 year olds. But these were thrashed after one day at the pool. Probably ok for toddlers etc but not older kids"
1.0,Not worth the money tiny tiny.
1.0,you get what you pay for.  arived with stones missing so I put it where it belonged in the trash. not worth the price of gas to return for refund. would not lasdt five minutes with a young girl
1.0,"Hidious! not as full as this pic. Sparse and cheap looking...looks like shoe string running thru plastic chains,  DO NOT PURCHASE"
1.0,"Don‚Äôt waste the order or return . Super cheap extremely faded looks worn . Opened the box , closed it right away and sent it back."
1.0,Very small!!! One size does not fit all. This is either for women or men with small faces.
1.0,Junk  don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,It fits perfectly but shoddy snaps came out on the first snap.
1.0,ME ESTAFARON
1.0,Looks nice but poor quality. It broke within one month
1.0,The quality sucks. The strings are falling off already. Will not buy again.
1.0,"The dress was too thin and was made of easy to wrinkle material. The type of material that even if you iron it, once you sit down in it, it will be wrinkled again. You would live your life ironing that dress. I'm not big on ironing at all. Also the dress was not flattering for my butt. So, I returned it."
1.0,Only one worked
1.0,Not what I expected at all... Despite reading the reviews I purchased it and the bottom fit is not good at all. I was disappointed with this purchase :/
1.0,Way to big and I was trying to return for a smaller size and never got a response back on how to send back or the info I needed to send back so now it sits in my closet tags still on collecting dust
1.0,Broke 2 days after I got it. A little big for a 5 year old's wrist. Very stiff plastic band.
1.0,The product image is deceptive I agree with the other reviewers. You only get one chocolate bunny and as seen in other reviews its tiny for 8$
1.0,"The top part that goes over chest flares out too far, it looks terrible."
1.0,"Small. I‚Äôm a small and like a slightly loose PJ set and these were too small for me!<br />Shrinks ALOT in the wash. Very poor quality material. See through. Uncomfortable, itchy fabric after first wash. Waste of money!"
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture provided. And then I lost money returning it. Big flop. Don‚Äôt buy.
1.0,My son was wearing it to work one day and the crystal just popped open
1.0,Received in time and gave it to my granddaughter for Christmas. She put it on and it fit good BUT was missing the ‚Äòteeth‚Äô on both sides of the zipper!!! So the zipper was broken when they sent it.....beware.
1.0,So thin I dont feel confident putting anything heavier than 6 skeins if regular yarn in it.  Definitely NOT WORTH  the money!!  I'm very disappointed.
1.0,Broke first time using
1.0,The dress did not come with a belt.  In addition the top part of the dress was not as pictured!  It had ties around the shoulder straps which is not shown in any of the pictures.  I will keep as my daughter is wearing it for an upcoming school musical but I was very disappointed!!
1.0,Was disappointed that at the price of this thing you still have to use glue to secure the gem inside.
1.0,"This dress is made as cheap as a Halloween costume!  It is made PAPER THIN,  Made extra small, almost made to fit a child not a teen!  And is made to &#34;LOOK&#34; all fancy in the picture but is NOT worth more than $10.  Very disappointing!"
1.0,Received it on July 13th and clasp already has broken. Like the product but thought it would last longer than that. Contacted sharkk customer service through the email on the warranty info that came when purchased. Never received response back.
1.0,"The flower came separatly. It has a hole where the ring is supposed to go to connect it with the necklace but it's not in there, it just did not come with it.<br /><br />It looks pretty in the picture but it is just a very bad quality... even for something this cheap. I mean, you could at least glue it together or something."
1.0,"Not protective enough, lots of gaps in the sides."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt bother, the backs were so poorly attached that they fell apart after one wearing."
1.0,tooo small
1.0,This did not come with the wig as described. The cape does not lace down the front as shown and the stocking included are not as pictured!
1.0,"For the cost of these I thought they would be superior to the cheap ones, boy was I wrong.  They are terrible.  Not stretchy enough to stay on your face.  I wore one of them for 10 minutes then threw all of them in the trash.  100% waste of money."
1.0,Too loose<br />Picture was not true
1.0,Product received damaged.
1.0,Liked the look but can not put it on keys because  the picture chips off. :(
1.0,This product is very cheaply made size is very off n I payed way to much for what I received
1.0,Very small!  I returned it.
1.0,Lost this wallet 10 times in the first week. It slide right out of my pocket.
1.0,"Does NOT fit Pandora type bracelets, despite their insistence--even on this page.  It would fit on the actual rope/chain part if only you could get it on.  You can't.  I don't know what it's made of but it's essentially painted plastic.  Useless."
1.0,TOO STIFF
1.0,"Unless you are tiny, don't bother buying this. The jackets run small and are not made for women with curves."
1.0,"Fabric nearly paper thin. Transparent. It‚Äôs ok for a beach cover up, but it‚Äôs below my expectations. It held up in washer on fragile cycle. Not to be worn for events...just poor quality"
1.0,THE BOTTOMS FIT WEIRD AND ARE UNCOMFORTABLE. TOP IS OK. WILL DONATE.
1.0,Smaller than I thought and cheap material.  Feels like windbreaker material
1.0,"The band looks good, but the loop only connects via a weak magnetization.  It slipped off several times upon first wearing, and I stopped using it."
1.0,Awful. Returned it immediately. Looked like a halloween costume. Cheap material and not shaped as shown
1.0,Ladies Xxl fits more like a child size
1.0,Do they have 1/2 star for review? They only sent 50 instead of 100 like the description says. Also these are super duper thin and horrible !!! Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,"I ordered this dress in a size 12 and contacted Eden with my custom measurements as they had recommended. They never again contacted me to confirm my custom order or answer any questions. I emailed them 5 times after I placed my order ,starting on the same day as my order  to assure that they received my custom measurements and they never contacted me back. The dress came in a size 12 and was not a custom fit.  No invoice with the dress.  I took the dress in to get it altered for a custom fit, which cost more than the dress.  However this was for my daughters wedding and I was able to get it altered.  This company does not have customer service like the reviews say.  If you look there aren't any recent customer reviews. Don't expect to get a custom sized dress.  The dress is cute and drops lots of glitter however sizing is a problem and to return it costs as much as buying it.  Buyer beware!  I will never buy from this company again."
1.0,"Very thin material, cheap quality."
1.0,"I'm not sure if I got a pair that was cut small or in a way they couldn't stretch properly, but i usually wear a size 10 bottom and these were so tight i could only get them halfway up my thighs. Also i cut the tag of and there was a small home where the plastic &#34;string&#34; was poked into the very thin material. I ordered teal amd was super excited forbthe color, but sadly i am returning these.<br /><br />Edit: adding now, I requested to return these leggings and I have to pay return postage for them. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,I‚Äôm going to return it. It keeps falling apart and I lost my Fitbit on a bike ride. It slipped out of the metal case. Pretty but useless.
1.0,Looks dirty
1.0,The bracelet was too big for my wifes wrist.
1.0,"One of the four sunglasses came broken. The others feel like they are from the dollar store. Really poor quality. Uncomfortable - don‚Äôt fit well. Always hang down to one side - they don‚Äôt fit straight. Wanted to return, but it says they don‚Äôt qualify for a return even though I bought them way less than 30 days ago. Don‚Äôt bother with these. They are useless."
1.0,The hole was to big to fit most earring post.  I had to send them back.
1.0,Horrible horrible no lo compren tela corriente p√°rese un costal malas costuras no pagar√≠a por el
1.0,too small very disappointing.
1.0,Chains are so small like for kids
1.0,Awful! They sent me gold instead of silver! The picture makes them look much more elegant than they are in reality.
1.0,Awful shirt and fabric...
1.0,Material was very thin. Dress way too small. Order a size up
1.0,"Received July 19th, 2018 one trip down the beach and outer lens material is coming off. The view out of these otherwise is incredible. Never worn in water at all. Disappointed with the lens durability.<br /><br />***update***<br />Received e-mail from seller, already sent replacement lenses in the mail! I really love a seller that understands GREAT customer service!<br />Will review new lenses once they are delivered..."
1.0,My fascinator arrived today FLAT as a pancake.  Have no idea how to get it to look like the photo and I wanted it to wear on Sunday.  How do I fix?  Can it be fixed?  Truly disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,These are a huge waste of money!!!! With Covid glove prices have gone through the roof these are no exception. I wouldn't be so mad if they didn't cost like $25.00 but they did what a rip off!
1.0,This is a horrible horrible fit dress it‚Äôs so bad that I wouldn‚Äôt wear it to clean the house. The 99c store has better quality clothing.
1.0,"This claims to be a PLUS size w ""plenty of room"". It is no where near plus size. It does say in there one size fits most, but not hardly. They need to take plus size out if the title for sure. It also was say short, more Luke s shirt than a cover up. I'm an 18/20 & I barely got it on."
1.0,The band start getting Scratch from day one from regular use
1.0,"I only wear this shoes in office 5 days/week, broke after 2 months of use. Very disappointing quality."
1.0,My size 2XL came as a small but the leggings itself is soft just doesn‚Äôt fit
1.0,I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  NICE DESIGN BUT TURNED BLACK RIGHT AWAY
1.0,The material was not the texture I desire.
1.0,Did not fit like It said
1.0,"This watch worked as advertised for three months.  Then the left-hand stem (for setting time) disappeared, and that watch face is unusable.  The watch fogs up inside now that the left hole isn't covered.<br />I'm guessing what's left of the watch will soon die.<br /><br />I like the watch and wish it lasted longer.<br /><br />It has three time settings, two analog and one digital.  If you should try to synchronize them, it is a waste of time.  They are each driven separately and drift apart."
1.0,Can't change the size
1.0,Was super tight at stomach and too small in chest  Does not come any larger apparently.
1.0,"The size is misleading.  It says up to 9, however, it is a size 9.5 in American sizes.  Unless you are a clown or a large size 9 these won't fit you!!!  I bought this for my niece for Christmas and she is a size 7 shoe.  I didn't even pull them out of the box until last night and I have to make a last minute dash to find something else in stores.  The whole reason I purchased online was to avoid the craziness of the stores.  VERY VERY Disappointed.  Not sure if it's too late to return them but they are useless to me!"
1.0,This is just a gold safety pin
1.0,Biker friends - these aren't the stirrups you are looking for.  (They are very short & the clasp capacity is designed for girls stretchy leggings...certainly NOT for jeans and no way for leather chaps).<br /><br />I was looking to replace my existing stirrups that I'll use in inclement weather to keep my chaps pulled tight around the base of my boots.  I wanted stirrups that would clasp the side seams of my chaps and wrap under my boot (just in front of the boot heal).<br /><br />These don't even come close.  They are made for women who like to tuck their thin jeans/stretchy pants into their boots.
1.0,so the shoulders drooped down to about my mid arm.  The sleeves hung about 4 inches longer than my hands.  It fit around my waist and i could button it..yay!  It was a mass of wrinkles...ugh. surely there is something better out there
1.0,too big and heavy for pierced ears
1.0,"It is too small for my average-size wrist. Male, 200lbs, 6'. This item is not a one-size-fits all, as it is being sold. Also, it is not made in the oval shape of a wrist; it is round instead. I can't see this fitting anyone. My girlfriend tried it and was loose on her and she couldn't really adjust it because its shape. This is a piece of metal with a map on it - NOT a wearable accessory. I like the design and know it would look nice on me but it is just not unwearable, which means it is worthless. Waste of money, unless your Pinocchio and have dowels for wrists. VERY disappointed, considering the source."
1.0,Its nice to small for my lunch and ice pack at work
1.0,Watch came already scratched up and is super light. I've owned gumball watches with better quality if I'm being honest. But delivery was satisfactory at least..
1.0,Unfortunately this beautiful bag does not hold up.  The lining started pulling apart within a month.  I have not carried this bag frequently and am shocked at how poorly the liner is.
1.0,This is junk!
1.0,This bag wasn't what I expected at all. I was going to return it but it was going to cost triple what I paid for the purse to send it back. So dissatisfied.
1.0,Just got this in the mail yesterday and it broke while my daughter was putting it on
1.0,I was so exited about this product !! First of all it doesn‚Äôt even come with instructions okay fine so I come to here where I brought them and followed the video posted and it didn‚Äôt work. I thought it was just me so I tried it on a friend and also had them try to do it on me and my finger was aching holding that light for so long. 15 minutes later and the gem still was not sticking. Extremely disappointing I ended up using mail glue üôÑ not worth the money I spent at all
1.0,The strap broke within 2 weeks
1.0,This cap is way to small to be marketed as ideal for ponytails.
1.0,Brim of hat is short and looks funny. Very poor quality also
1.0,Chain turned.  Colored skin. Very pretty but needs better chain.
1.0,"Horrible, came in as a super small. I'll never be able to wear it."
1.0,"I purchased these shoes for a 10 mo old baby who normally wears a sz 4, however, they run very small. The size chart reads large, the shoe tag reads size 3. My granddaughter has a med/wide foot, just too small."
1.0,This is not a small fit for an adult
1.0,This item is misleading. The bracelet is very thin and cheap looking. The t-bar is to short. You could lose this bracelet if you‚Äôre not careful. I sent back for a refund.
1.0,It would have been better to buy a cheap pair from the gas station... Do not buy these cheap glasses.
1.0,Ordered an XXL and when it came it was so small that it didn't fit over my husbands shoulders. It fit my 11 year old really well.
1.0,Size was for a baby or toddler and wasn't even the pattern ordered.
1.0,"I clean a lot of shoes and figure I would give this a try. I followed the directions exactly and let them soak overnight. When done I used a show brush to scrub them. No magic happened. I figured I would give another shot and put in twice the amount recommended, soaked another overnight in fresh water/detergent and still nothing happened. This product cost more than others and doesn't work. Better off getting original pink stuff and scrubbing shoes. Returned product to Amazon."
1.0,Defective - Straps were sewn in the wrong place and were sewn backwards.  Dress fit terribly and the cut was way off.  Don't waste your time and money on this!  Returning.
1.0,Color lighter than expected. Poor quality. Missing stiching on the sleeve. Glad I noticed it before I left the house. Washed it before I wore it so I can't return it.
1.0,"I thought the handles were longer, it didn't fit well on shoulder , had to struggle to get it on top of my shoulder and that was without a jacket/coat...not like picture"
1.0,Returning this item was not the right size way larger then what it should be not made properly
1.0,"I can‚Äôt wear them. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 28 waist, 35 hips. I ordered my normal size small. They‚Äôre huge through the groin. And fit like capris, about halfway up my calf. Not sure what‚Äôs going on with these, but it definitely ain‚Äôt good."
1.0,PIECE OF GARBAGE!!! NOT WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT. PLUS POSTAGE.  CAKE BROKE OFF FROM THE CLAPSFIRST TIME IT WAS WORN!  DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE TO PURCHASE
1.0,These are not sized properly. If they had an offer of negative stats I would give it. Pasted these around my community and no one could fit in them.
1.0,We all returned the skirt. It stuck out in front. Not flattering.
1.0,"Not for adults, too small"
1.0,"I was so disappointed to get this dress because it's several sizes too small. Despite other reviews stating it runs true to size, I ordered a size up to allow some forgiveness and allow for alterations if needed. The dress was super short, at least 3-4 inches off of the ground in the front, very short train but probably because it was so short! It didn't fit over my hips/butt and no chance that it would close in the back. The lace work damaged and there were several holes. Upon contacting the seller, they have refused to issue me a refund unless a leave a positive review. STAY AWAY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!"
1.0,This dress was supposed to be in black and have pockets.  It arrived in BLUE with NO pockets.  Enough said!  Returning as soon as I can print out the label.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Ordered 2 of these sweaters in 9 months ago. They fit fine and were cute but seams have already unraveled and both sweaters now have holes.
1.0,"This products material was horrible. I was excited to get it do to the fact that it was green and purple, and I happen to like those colors alot. When I tried it on the material was very uncomfortable and the sleeves were too tight and the torso to large. I disliked this product greatly"
1.0,"The material is see through got a large cause I run med but were to big, cheap materials"
1.0,I bought a XXXL and it fit my friend who is a size 6. I couldn't return it because our mailman decided to leave the package out in a severe thunderstorm and it was water damanged by the time I got home.
1.0,"Unit only worked one time. Tried to use it again a little over a week ago after plugging the battery back in overnight and when I got up my ladder stand, plugged the battery in and tried to turn the vest on and did not work. Have tried to charge the battery with three different charging cables over the last week and hook it up to the vest and nothing happens at all<br /><br />Update: Since I've posted this review my email inbox has been HAMMERED by emails from 3-4 different email addresses and names from this company all using very broken English and very poor grammar that read much like scam emails. They have repeatedly asked me to take this review down and offered to let me keep the faulty product and send me a gift card in the amount of my purchase, not to actually refund the card I used, which kind of makes refunding the item more of a hassle as I'd have to use the gift card only on a future online order. I have repeatedly blocked these emails and reported as spam only to receive another from a different email address claiming to be this company. Ridiculous!!!"
1.0,Hole in one pair they are not really heavy.
1.0,Very thin and cheap looking compnay refunded my money broke before  could wear them.
1.0,this product is not as long in length for tall people
1.0,"Have a few pairs from last year that are my fave and I absolutely love, however,  just received 2 new pairs today and they are completely different pants. So disappointed! Will not order again."
1.0,Cheap and to small.
1.0,"I ordered two of these shirts, one black and one red. I had to send them both back. The red one had two holes in it. The black one was made of much better material and was made well, but was a bit small. If the black one was the next size up, I probably would have loved it. However, the red one was was totally unacceptable. I am including a couple of picture of the red one."
1.0,Crap quality. Paper thin.
1.0,Worst item I ever purchased from Amazon. Looks like a Halloween costume.
1.0,"These are so cute, but the lining is sewn all wrong so they are not wearable unless you are a pretzel.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift, so by the time I found out they were horribly constructed and literally unwearable, the return window had closed.  VERY disappointed."
1.0,"What a waste of money and time!<br />1- They stink up the room as soon as you open them.<br />2- They‚Äôre similar to trash bags, although I‚Äôve had better quality trash bags.<br />3- They‚Äôre spelled wrong!!<br />4- They arrived damaged.<br />5- DO NOT BUY!!"
1.0,The size chart is not accurate at all. Im returing it! I am very disappointed.
1.0,Horrible biene mui corto y lo agarr√© xl no lo puedo usar
1.0,Cheaply made and cheap material
1.0,I ordered an XL the tags said a M! Overall material felt really thin and cheap! Wouldn‚Äôt recommend even if they sent the right size!
1.0,"Product not form fitting as picture indicated, sloppy fit/to large. I workout 6 days a week and was looking for shirts that were from fitting vs. oversized and sloppy. A med would be to small and a large is what I wear."
1.0,Actually didn‚Äôt fit me even know that I choose the right side!
1.0,Disappointed: they are NOT yellow. They're an awful pea-green.
1.0,This band is definitely not worth $27. It was easy to resize with patience and 2 small screwdrivers but It still feels like cheap rubber and seems like it won't last long. The links are flimsy and the clasp is very cheap. This band should be about $10.
1.0,Stud broken resulting in lost stone and unattached plate.
1.0,"Sleeves were inside out and had deodorant powder stainü•¥ü•¥why does Amazon do this smh. Looked big tho, but didnt try it obviously."
1.0,"Way too small. Im 5‚Äô4‚Äù<br />125 lbs, ordered large and it doesn‚Äôt fit me!! How insulting. Hard to contact seller!! You need to buy return stamp and it cost $27.  Don‚Äôt waste your hard earned money for piece of crap."
1.0,Don't waste your time. Smelled like vinegar and looks nothing like the photo.
1.0,"so disappointed,cheap looking..."
1.0,"The item I was sent is not the item pictured above. It was a long black bob, not an asymmetrical wig with a lifted ponytail like back piece. The wig I did receive was not good quality either. I would not recommend."
1.0,The logos on the watch band & the frame around the watch face was worn as if it was used & the hour number did not work. I was disappointed but thought I‚Äôd let my 6 year old decide & even he said it needed returned! A replacement is ordered so hoping it was just a fluke & it will be made right.
1.0,"No me agrad√≥ la tela, el color no es como en la foto, es muy transparente, ped√≠ reembolso y el vendedor me dijo que deber√≠a de donarlo. Perd√≠ mi dinero."
1.0,ODD fitting.
1.0,I ordered a large which I usually am between a large and medium. The very top of the waist is way too small as in comparison to the whole waist material. I was just gonna stretch and rip the thin elastic but Amazon has free returns. Fabric is thin and silky like. Not what I was looking for
1.0,To big looks like woman purse.
1.0,The diameter of the hole in the needle is TOO SMALL for the laces I was trying to replace.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"Really off on size , it was a gift had to return. Was pretty, seemed well made. If your thin and not a plus size you might have better luck."
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL. I normally take an XL and ordered the 4XL- just too small.
1.0,It's very small on me
1.0,"This was the worst brooch I've ever  bought. It was much smaller than I expected, and did not look as nice as in the picture. The first time I tried to wear it the pin broke off completely, so it had to be thrown out. Sad. I see there are a lot of good reviews, so I probably got a lemon."
1.0,"Adorable shoe, my daughter loved it for two weeks until the sole came unglued from the rest of the shoe! We were out running errands and suddenly the bottom of her shoe fell off. Apparently very cheaply made, which was a big disappointment and pretty inconvenient to have her shoeless in the middle of our day far from home. At least she wasn‚Äôt at school or on a field trip or something where she would have been stuck hobbling around in one shoe the rest of the day."
1.0,These pants fit as expected and are comfortable. I haven't washed them yet but I've worn them three times for a total of maybe 10 hours just as loungewear and there's already a half inch hole in the crotch. Extremely disappointed and upset I can't return them because the return window is only one month. Terrible quality even for the price.
1.0,Fit was terrible not what I was expecting at all
1.0,Gross disgusting cheap shirt. The seashells were supposed to be purple gradient but are black brown. The whole product is bad!
1.0,Does not fit my watch at all.
1.0,"worst shirt ever, horrible fabric, extremely narrow on the shoulder and too big on all other places. dont waste your money"
1.0,not very good quality material - would not have purchased this had I touched it  in person
1.0,The material is and looks cheap!!<br />There were NO tags on this dress. Why?????<br />It appeared to have been thrown in the bag‚Ä¶. Very wrinkled!
1.0,Runs really small order one size larger
1.0,Picture explains everything! Couldn't even handle 1 wash.
1.0,Cute earrings but I had to return because one clasp would not stay shutüò™. It was a quick and easy return though.
1.0,the wore fabric. it doesn't look like in the pic.
1.0,"In june 2019 i bought a columbia powderlite mid jacket. It‚Äôs very good. But i used only one season november 2019-march2020 in Turkey, changed the filling material in a way. Serious filling material gaps in the back."
1.0,The charm and chain tarnish bad. Not sterling silver product. I will be more careful when buying jewlry and read the reviews. Lost my money.
1.0,"This is not like the photo.  It is very thin and kind of ‚Äúmeshy‚Äù.  Might be ok for summer with a camisole, but sadly, it is not a roomy warm sweater/ cartigan."
1.0,"There is no way this is silver, its super light weight, not suitable for my partner for christmas. So disappointed."
1.0,"The metal end of the buckle is too big to fit through the buckle clip. We watched tutorials and tried many different ways to get it through, but it gets stuck. Definitely returning this."
1.0,"Lenses did not fit the frames, nor were they the correct color. I get the concept of you get what you pay for. However, with such good reviews I would have thought I was actually getting the correct set of lenses. I have purchased aftermarket lenses for Oakley frames for years. I wear them to work so when they inevitably get scratched I replace them. With these lenses I never got to use them so I can‚Äôt vote for durability, scratch resistance, or polarization. I think my biggest disappointment was when I returned them, I didn‚Äôt get an explanation, sorry, or we will take care of it. I just got send it back for a refund like I made the mistake. Bad customer service even on good products makes me reconsider ever purchasing from them again."
1.0,"I am 5'7"" and I will not be able to wear this dress without leggings underneath.  Way shorter than the photos would lead you to believe.  I am also not crazy about the overall shape and fit.  Not very flattering."
1.0,The color and feel was cheap and ugly when recurved
1.0,I was expecting an oversize shirt made of a comfortable fabric. This is neither. You get a green t shirt. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I had to cut off the band around the top of the shirt off because it was so small, it couldn't even stretch far enough to get off one shoulder. I sew, so I can fix it but disappointed that I have too. Otherwise, I loved everything about it."
1.0,"like other have states, payed extra money to get the extension, only to receive it without the extension.  About to leave for a trip and completely let down. Will giving the 411 to all the riding buddies.  Garbage, save your money !"
1.0,Very cheaply made had to send it back
1.0,"This isn‚Äôt a good dupe. I ordered the white, and it feels like cheap fleece. The quality is poor and the smell is awful. I returned."
1.0,Im very disappointed
1.0,"Different kit than the picture arrived and no travel bag. The labels look different, different items. That is kind of weird. I have not tried them yet though to see if they are working and I am not sure if I am keeping it."
1.0,"Gloves are thin, tear with each use. Not recommended."
1.0,"This shirt sizing was terrible.  I need to return all of them.  Supposed to be Men‚Äôs Golf Shurt.  Terrible sizing!!!  Would not fit a child!  Made totally wrong.  I don‚Äôt know where it was made, but I need my money back!!!  I ordered several of them.  Bad Bad Bad!!!!!!!"
1.0,Extremely see through and thin...can't imagine wearing them in public
1.0,Zipper responsible for keeping clothes on one side broke during first use. Suitcase is useless. Seek another manufacturer as their customer service are horrible.
1.0,Chain tarnished upon 1 wearing. Unbelievably cheap material.
1.0,Size is wrong!!! Couldn‚Äôt even get my arm in it. I bought a size bigger than I usually wear and it‚Äôs about two sizes smaller than normal. To return product you have to pay to ship it back.
1.0,Material is like polyester from the 70's. Horrible material.
1.0,Very upset.  Anklet was cute but after one day of wearing it I look down and it‚Äôs gone. Waste of money
1.0,Very poor quality!!!! It was for Christmas
1.0,These do not run true to size tried one on and went straight back to into the packaging and did the return...
1.0,"If I could give 0 stars I would, these are literally like Halloween costume material they are not legging material straight up garbage the wholes for the knees weren't even at my knees they were way under."
1.0,"This is a very cheap belt. It even look cheap. It broke when I took it out of the package. I fixed it. Then broke again when I tried it on, fixed it again. I haven't wore it yet, I'm afraid it might fall off. I will not buy this again."
1.0,"They constantly slip down even if you put through your piercing.  Today one of them got caught on my sweater and almost pulled through my piercing.  Not only that but my ears got all red and burned, so don't think they are actually sterling silver.  Don't waist your time and money."
1.0,Bought a bulk of these watches. (10 plus) for my crew and crew mates. All the straps broke within a week.
1.0,lleg√≥ una mancuerna con el mecanismo interno suelto
1.0,"Ordered cross got fish ,,,"
1.0,Didn't receive it.
1.0,Bought 3 colors. Wore only this about 10 times before it broke putting it on. My hand is small and I was not over stretching it.  Wish I did not have 2 others. Afraid I'll lose my watch if it lets go while wearing. Too late to send back. What a waste of money.
1.0,"I thought the fit would be nice on these since they are sized. The do fit length-wise but they are super baggy around the fingers, sewn crooked, and the fingers are about half as long as they should be. I could have, and should have bought gloves in town for the same price and not waited for them to be shipped from China. Lesson learned."
1.0,When I received it it came twisted and tangled on one side I was so upset but I had to use it anyway because it was for my baby shower.
1.0,Zippers broke after five minutes of use
1.0,"I purchased the pink glasses and instead I received the black ones, it‚Äôs a no return item so I‚Äôm stuck with glasses I didn‚Äôt like."
1.0,horrible fit.i threw the thing away because it was too late for returning
1.0,I wanted to love this watch band. But.. The pin keeps popping out so it‚Äôs useless. üòñ
1.0,I really loved the color but it was very sheer. It was longer than expected but the material was soft. It just didn't work for me.
1.0,I didn't like it. Looks nothing like the photo. Deceiving
1.0,"Grey print, very hard to see."
1.0,"poor quality, are ugly and arrive bad machine clock"
1.0,The stone is crooked.  The metal is almost the width of a wire and does not look at all like the picture. I  have requested a refund.
1.0,Not impressed! This looked liked a child's apron. I had bought two for my daughters. I'm returning them both!
1.0,Not as advertised in picture. Bottom is cinched which makes it more circular in shape. Colors are nice but not as vibrant.
1.0,The chain broke as soon as I put it on.
1.0,Not stretchy enough. Plu the crouch ripped and I'm not over weight.
1.0,Super flimsy. It was pulled out of shape with little effort
1.0,Says large fits small
1.0,Bought in two sizes and both were way too small for my girls. Don‚Äôt recommend this brand
1.0,This is a nice item.  But the arms are cut too small.  I'm very heart broken.  It went so well with my dress but I could not wear it. SO DISAPPOINTED!!! It was returned.
1.0,I was able to actually make this thing work once and never again. The clips that hold the button on break before they make it all the through the material. My recommendation don't buy this
1.0,The ‚Äústride‚Äù was too short.
1.0,Too small to get around hand and I have small hands. This was child size and I ordered the mid size. Plus the bracelet is brown. NOT red as shown in the picture or as indicated in the name.
1.0,Very cheap quality. I bought an XL hoping it would be big on me and it couldn‚Äôt even fit my friend who is a size 4.
1.0,"Hi the Top on an XXL will only fit a size 32 B. I am a 38 C. The bottom of the dress in size XXL will fit you if your a size 14. Im a size 12. The top is to small, bottom is to Big. Its as if the dress is a size 4 on top and then gos into a size 14 on the bottom.  Very strange!!!!"
1.0,Way too big. Ridiculous.
1.0,This necklace broke literally as I took off the price tag!
1.0,It's cute...decent material...ordered two sizes up and still can't wear it WASTED MONEY
1.0,Poor quality. Broke the first day
1.0,"i bought this for the pointy silver one. i really like how it looked in my septum piercing. IT GOT STUCK. i could not get either side unscrewed for the life of me, even while using multiple tweezers. i tried to literally cut the metal and that didn‚Äôt work so i had to go to my piercer and have it taken out. i do not recommend these if you ever want to remove the piercing or switch it out in the future."
1.0,"So much shorter in length than even the measurements advertise. Purchased as a mid spring/summer blouse for south Texas and you would most definitely have to wear an undershirt because the front of this thing rose over my belly button. I make sure to pay attention to the measurements for these things and at times even remeasure, I even got a size larger than what was suggested but this thing is a moo moo that they ran out of fabric on 1/5 of the way down. I don‚Äôt even understand how the model had it tucked in! I like longer shirts which is why I ordered a size larger than suggested but this is clearly not at all what I ordered. Regardless unwearable and unfortunate that I had to waste time writing this review and pay for a product that the manufacturers lied about."
1.0,After one wash the seams in the arms came apart.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It was cute & comfy the one wear I got out of it.
1.0,The zipper broke after wearing it once! Only get one star because zero isint an option!
1.0,Too small. More like 34 - 36.
1.0,Why too short
1.0,"The shirt I got does not look like the shirt in the picture. It's bright blue w/really bright pink and while fake looking roses. The picture made the shirt appear more natural and muted. It's horribly ugly and I hope I can find the time to send it back, just based on principle. Companies should be required to send us what we are ordering and not something kind of like the picture."
1.0,garbage doesn't buy!!!!
1.0,"Material is like a Cheap halloween costume, the shape is odd and not like the picture. It was also missing the belt."
1.0,"Ahoy paloy, not what I expected, way too cheap!"
1.0,The L/XL is the same size or possibly even bigger than the 3X. I really like the look and feel of these leggings if only they would fit. I'm well aware these run small but the smaller size shouldn't be bigger than the larger size.
1.0,"I bought six shirts and there were three manufacturers. One was a Hanes BeefyT. Good heavy quality. One was a Gildan T-shirt - even better quality. The other four were cheap, thin American Apparel shirts that sell blank for about 7-9 bucks. I love the designs and the fact the company supports law enforcement, but paying $32.00 for one shirt ($26 + $6 for shipping) and getting a thin, cheap quality shirt is a rip off."
1.0,This is NOT long enough to be a cover up!  It looks like a crop top.  Ridiculous.
1.0,Have bought 2 different sizes and BOTH are too big
1.0,"Compro dos  franelas del mismo tama√±o y mandan una muchoooo m√°s peque√±a ,,, me sale m√°s econ√≥mica comprarla de nuevo que enviarla para atr√°s ,,, los env√≠os son muy costoso"
1.0,There small size it should be extra small. The info online said is true size and it wasn't... Material is good
1.0,Poor quality. You get what you pay.
1.0,The quality is sub-par. Mis-leading description and image as well. Save your money.
1.0,It could be my feet but it hurt mine when i tried walking
1.0,Listen..... This hoodie is GROSSLY undersized. How does a 5xl fit like a LARGE!?!?!?! Never ordering this again.  Waiting for my 6xl to come in tomorrow so I can return it too....
1.0,Stone fell out the first time I wore it!! Don‚Äôt waste your money!
1.0,these are very cheaply made glasses - would not recommend
1.0,"Bought these exact style of capris almost 2 years ago and they were amazing! Lasted through a pregnancy with a 40lb weight gain before getting a hole in them, so I decided I would pay nearly double what I paid for my first pair just to get the same quality.... Well sadly these were not the same pants AT ALL!! I wore them one time and got a hole in the &#34;reinforced&#34; crotch area, as well as the waistband was coming unsewn... Now to find a new favorite pair of leggings :-/"
1.0,Look away. The description is wrong. The size for the wrist is BIG. And you can see the glue everywhere.
1.0,WAY too small.  Definitely not US sizes.  I couldn't even get it over my arms.
1.0,"Material is not as advertised, and cut is awful. Does not look like beautiful flowers as advertised. I thought it looked like camouflage material and my husband walked in and asked if I was going hunting. Returned"
1.0,"Terrible, one of the bars that holds the wrist strap broke after only 2 weeks."
1.0,so so quality - not what expected
1.0,I GOT A LARGE BUT IT SAID IT'S XXL
1.0,Huge and tacky. Had to return.
1.0,The sizing on this was wayy off. It was huge
1.0,Absolutely positively do not recommend anyone buying this junk
1.0,"Cheap looking, the earrings don't even match, they are different colors...went straight to the trash"
1.0,Button fell off on the second use.
1.0,The shirt doest hang as low as pic and is very loose under arms  and bust big gap<br />Material is like a thicker tshirt<br />Its good quality but not for every shape
1.0,It was way too small. Returned it for a full refund.
1.0,Necklace broke the next day. tried to fix it but it broke again. Waste of money.
1.0,"Cute, but terrible quality. My daughter wore one time and they already had snags! I washed one time, and the cat faces lost their thread tightness, making the face look blurry and overly worn. Keep looking, these are not the tights you want!"
1.0,"the smooth tec has a weird plastic feel, and they are super thin. I will not ever wear these."
1.0,"Horrible dress, i dont even know what build this was made for! Very disappointing, and definitely returning! I wondered if it was maybe too big but shoulders are not even wide enough for her tiny frame"
1.0,Feathers starting falling off after one use
1.0,The dress came stained!
1.0,"Horrible case, cheap, cheap, cheap!!  Would never order again."
1.0,Disappointed in the coloring of the green croc.  Nothing like the picture.  What arrived was a teal color not green.  Poor quality too. The buckle fell off as you tighten the strap.
1.0,This coat just arrived today and the stitching is done horribly you can tell this coat won‚Äôt hold up long! I attached 2 pictures of the long strings hanging on the front of the coat one by the pocket and you they in the middle of the coat not far from the zipper! Was also hoping it would be a warmer coat unit is very thin! Will be returning!
1.0,this it didn't look or fit anything like the picture total waste of money and it up throwing in the garbage
1.0,"Not what I expected with 100% Uv coverage.  After receiving this, I  immediately responded with an email requesting a return label, thus far NO answer.  Much cheaper look for the price."
1.0,"Not support was however , very floppy.... no use for yoga... never mind running"
1.0,This is not at all what is pictured. The detail is completely different as well as the material. Definitely disappointed.
1.0,Less than a month and they're already starting to fall apart. Pretty disappointing.
1.0,Very disappointed material is cheap and 2. long.
1.0,Turned after a couple of weeks of using it. So disappointing. I loved this ring
1.0,This is at terrible cheap and no good watch
1.0,Well I am sorry to say that but what it looks like on the page and what it looks like in real life such a different thing. They look lovely advertised on Amazon but they look so cheap and clunky in real life. I was extremely disappointed. And they are heavy on the ear absolutely not light-weight.
1.0,My daughter wore the boots TWICE and the bottom rubber came off.
1.0,So cheap. Dollar store quality so sorry I bought it
1.0,"I don't know of I just missed it in the description,  but there are no pins included with this to even attach it to a watch. Its completely useless to me without those. I bought it to be a quick band change for my smartwatch, but it's a total waste without the pins to attach it."
1.0,I was very disappointed with this top. It is shown as a tie dye sweatshirt however it is not.<br />It has a somewhat shiny material instead of the usual soft sweatshirt material.<br />Total waste of money.
1.0,"When I saw these, I was thrilled. I was worried that they would be too large, because I love tiny earrings. When I opened the box, my heart fell to the ground. Nothing like the picture. So small that there is nothing recognizable. I would have been happy if it had no silver, just the chrystal by itself would be beautiful. Now, I am trying to return, but having a problem. I do not have a printer,at 68 I am happy with my Kindle. In the past there was an option to pay $1.00 for a label to be mailed USPS, but that doesn't seem to be available. I called and was told that UPS would deliver to me a printed return label. Three days later and no label yet. Yesterday they left an order in my mailbox , but they did not come to my door or leave in my mailbox. I have never given a bad review to any service from Amazon. As you can see from my account, I am a very busy Prime Member. I still love you Amazon, and know you will get this resolved. But this has not been service that I expect from Amazon. Thank you. I know that this has just been an off week. Hope that I get a return label tomorrow. Thank you, Doris Wood."
1.0,See through and paper thin.
1.0,"These are very cheap looking.  The part that goes through the ear is too thick.  On me, one of them hangs  sideways and I can not get it to face forward.  In short, I can't wear them.  Will not buy from this company again."
1.0,It was very cute when first received but it's absolute trash after 1.5 months. This was not solid metal like the seller advertised. I contacted the seller but the seller hasn't replied in 2 weeks. Customer service is essentially nonexistent.<br /><br />Highly do not recommend.
1.0,"This is pretty, but the lace feels like plastic."
1.0,Muy pequeno y de tela mala
1.0,These fit my 7 year old
1.0,"I have had these since November, and they are now a yellow.  If they were truly rose gold, they would not fade. In fact, the backings are actually still rose gold, not sure what the stud is.... disappointing."
1.0,Very see thru! Too bad!
1.0,These are a joke. I couldn't get them past my ankle.  Poor quality too.  Disappointed!
1.0,"The quality is too cheap and bad, at least I used 2 times before it get broken"
1.0,Not military grade. Main strap stitching pulled out of pack with a mere 68 pound load. This would probably be suitable for a woman carrying light loads of unwanted clothes to the thrift store but forget it if you're a man doing real work and your life depends on your gear.
1.0,Love the color and style way way to small ordered a large and fits like a small wife liked it tried it on said nope so I aint happy but it is what it is üôÑ so if your 4 ft tall and Asian size it will fit perfectly...... so if I could do a half star I would.
1.0,This is what happened after 31 days
1.0,This is Halloween costume material!! Do. Not. Waste. Your. Money.
1.0,"Marked as a S/M. When I took them to the hospital to use after my surgery, they cut of the circulation in my legs. I'm a small person (5' 1&#34; 120#. Can I return both pair?"
1.0,"I like the style but the quality is very poor. Within 2weeks it began to tarnish, as for the smaller one , it has a rough cut, too."
1.0,There is no swing to this dress!  The length was shorter than pictured as was the way it looked.  The ribbon waist didn't really match even though they were both navy blue.
1.0,"Terrible product. I thought it was inside out, but no, it was just extremely poorly made. I‚Äôll be donating this shirt. Hopefully someone will appreciate the exposed seams and complete lack of any recognizable pattern."
1.0,Both packages broken
1.0,it was broke when i got it
1.0,"The shoes look great. Unfortunately, only one of the shoes had working lights. The other one never turned on even after charging it. The shoes are pretty slim so order up a size if you want to risk it and hope for two functioning shoes."
1.0,XL fit like an XS.
1.0,"Not sure what noxious chemical this garment was soaked in, but cannot wear it is too small and smells beyond belief! I tried it on and it is definitely not an XL! Might fit my daughter who wears a size 4 (but the smell is overwhelming)."
1.0,I think it ran a little small but the big issue was the workmanship. None of the pieces were sewn together right on one side. Colored blocks were all cockeyed.
1.0,"Not as pictured.  Dull finish.  Although it was not expensive, it wasn't worth keeping.  Sent back for a refund."
1.0,Hate the material that this came in and it wasn't as nice looking as the picture shows it.
1.0,i expected to be able to adjust them easily and turn them inside out. they have a seem that is annoying for me
1.0,"Said it was American sizes, but it wasn't, way too small.  Extremely poor quality construction also, very thin fabric. Would not buy this brand, use caution with this seller!!!"
1.0,Dont like the material and the neck part
1.0,This shirt is junk. A shirt that crinkles. No thanks.
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt the same color as shown in picture and the snaps would not snap I‚Äôm returning ASAP
1.0,I'm so disappointed.  These we're so small I couldn't fit one leg in them.  These are not plus size. A 2x is more like a size four.
1.0,"idk how they size things.  I wear a 2xl jacket that is big on me so I order 3xl to be safe.  I couldn't even get it over my arms when it arrived.  the buttons on it were broken, had an odd smell.  just overall trash product"
1.0,Just didnt think it was cute and the fit was terrible
1.0,No. M gusto.  Como. Ven√≠an.  No. Ven√≠an.  En. Caja
1.0,"Too large and round, made me look very large no matter what size I ordered. Also, the material is very rough and feels very cheap. Returned and got a refund twice."
1.0,"The dress I received was not the dress shown, sleeves were short rather than long, back was exposed rather than covered, and there was cinch type closure for back instead of zipper. I had to hire a seamstress to do all of these alterations as there was not time to return and start over! The material was very nice and so was the lace."
1.0,A piece of junk very flimsy
1.0,"I bought three pairs of these as work socks because my previous socks (of a different brand) were starting to wear out.  Those socks lasted two years.  Two pairs of my new &#34;Darn Tough&#34; socks have holes in the toes on the FOURTH TIME I have worn them!  These are by far the weakest socks I have ever encountered, and I would certainly never buy another thing from Darn Tough."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:2271e9a54aef14f3fe0f989743b76dbb]] The glue on the started coming off after a few days
1.0,Didn‚Äôt make any  difference with night glare
1.0,These shoes were awful. They look great however they caused my son's feet to peel. I was not certain the shoes were the cause initially. But once we discontinued the use of the sandals his feet cleared up immediately.
1.0,"I love the pants but they are to large ,WENT TO 2 UPS AND THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME 20 DOLLARS TO SEND ,NO WAY ,NOT MY FAULT FOR THIS COMPANY SENDING WRONG SIZE ,BAD I WILL NOT GIVE 20 TO SEND BACK FOR THERE MISTAKE IN SIZE."
1.0,Off no use at all for this product and thouight it was going to go around the back.  Pretty stupid to have something that just goes over the nipple and I just returned it.
1.0,"color is really dull so not happy bcoz it wasn,t wat i expected from the picture"
1.0,the blast thing brok the first day i put it on
1.0,Too tight and very low quality--it tore in 5 or 6 wearings
1.0,Absolutely not what I expected! It looks cute and cuddly in the picture but it‚Äôs scratchy and the worst color of pink in real life! Poor quality
1.0,I had high hope for these but they only go 3/4 of the way in the shoe. I should send them back but I'm not going to waste more money doing that.
1.0,This band lost is elasticity in DAYS!  Don‚Äôt waste your time or money.
1.0,"Thin/faded material, and color more a dark brown than black. Would have been fine if it was dark grey, but it wasn't."
1.0,Skirt is see through and the elastic at the top of the skirt is folds and twist
1.0,"The shirt is very sheer, i didn‚Äôt expect much out of it but definitely more than what it‚Äôs got. The fit was weird, looked like a grocery bag and I‚Äôm pretty sure they sewed the flap on the wrong side of the shirt, picture included."
1.0,a week that I buy them
1.0,THERE IS NO WHITE!! IT IS BEIGE!! DARK GRAY/BLACK AND LIGHT GRAY!<br />THE COLORS MIXED MAKES THE PANTS LOOK LIKE A GREEN CAMO! I BOUGHT THESE THINKING WHITE. BLACK AND GREY. AND NOPE!<br />I‚Äôm a size 17 in pants and these XL run small! the waist area is tight while the rest of the pants are a flow and have room.
1.0,Would be cute if it fit. The shirt i ordered is a 2x when i normally wear a L or xl & it is way to small. I would say it fits like a S or M.
1.0,The sparkles fall off AND get all over EVERYTHING.
1.0,Color did not match what was shown.
1.0,"material was bad quality, feels like a tablecloth you buy from party city and throw out after one use."
1.0,Too bad that I can‚Äôt even replace it
1.0,"I had these shoes for a month and the fabric is torn by my heel. This is my 4th pair of Brooks running shoes and I am disappointed in the quality of this pair. My other pairs were in great shape after a year, but these hardly lasted a month :("
1.0,Loved it the first time I wore it. But one wash and it shriveled up too many sizes too small and had wrinkles I could not get out for the life of me.
1.0,"These are not sweatpants. They are not cotton, not fleece, not even remotely soft. The fabric is thin (not warm, not cozy at all) but still weirdly stiff. The only way I can think to describe it is as a &#34;soft shell&#34; (for folks who are familiar with outdoor gear.) The fabric doesnt drape or move with you. It bunches up/pooches out at the tummy area. I am 5'6&#34; 138lbs, athletic build. I ordered size XL because I wanted a super baggy ankle-cuff pair of sweatpants... like borrowing a boyfriend's. :) Big and soft and make you feel tiny and cute!!! How do these manage to *still* make me look fat???  I've tried everything from wearing them super low on hips, to folding/rolling over the waist band, to wearing high at waist, cinching drawstring tight, and letting drawstring out. I adore the print and wanted these to work so badly. I washed them several times, hoping they'd either shrink (nope) or soften up (nope.) Pockets are placed in a slightly strange place or at a strange angle that is not natural or comfortable. I think the pattern used to make these pants is just really simple/not correct and the fabric is super cheap. I find it difficult to imagine a body type on which these would fit or look good."
1.0,Came discolored charms look like plastic one fell off first time I wore it. very disappointed in this bracelet overall
1.0,"Odd fit, small in some areas large in others. Ordered one and didn‚Äôt fit right up sized sand still fit extremely odd."
1.0,Zero stars!!! They broke on the first day! Don't waste your money!
1.0,Its super big i send mine back
1.0,Item broken in one day
1.0,"Legs are tight, these feel like women's to me not mens."
1.0,The ring around the jewel that holds it in cracked and broke less then two days after I got a set. The Jewel just fell out when I was wearing them. They look nice but are cheaply made. I won't be ordering a replacement.
1.0,"I can see how some folks may think this little &#34;wallet&#34; is cool, but those people obviously carry very small wallets and like to jump on &#34;coolness&#34; bandwagons.  It is a stretch to even call this a wallet.  There are many true wallets available that have the capability to attach it to your belt or to whatever you wish to attach.  After getting it I certainly don't consider it a wallet.  It is a leather and metal toy-wallet.  It is very much a &#34;minimalist&#34; wallet because it has only minimal usefulness.  I also thought it was cool ... until I got it and realized the coolness was destroyed by its impracticality.  It is WAY too small to be of practical value and much less efficient when you need to get to the stuff that could be more easily and practically carried in a normal trifold wallet.  After going through the hassle of breaking it in per the instructions via the warm water method and sorting through which plastic cards and items I would have to do without (because it can't realistically hold them all), I used it for a couple of days then gladly returned to my trifold.  One really BAD issue is that when you break the wallet in with a certain number of cards - let's say 8 - you will have difficulties if you then wish to carry less because they will not be tightly held within the wallet.  Even the instructions warn of this; therefore, anyone rebuking that fact is contradicting what the manufacturer themselves say!  You can possibly carry more cards than you broke it in with, but not less.  If you don't carry much in your wallet, want something cool and feel the need to brag about what is actually a stupid &#34;wallet&#34; concept, and are willing to endure a bit more effort to get to what is in your wallet, then go ahead and buy it.  But if you carry more than a few credit cards, want to be able to show or see you licenses without having to dig them out of the stack of plastic, and want to carry more than just a few items, this is NOT the wallet you should buy.  Instead, get a good trifold or tablet style wallet.  It is also way overpriced.  When and if Trayvax makes a true wallet I may reconsider and buy from them."
1.0,The dress was very sweet through and made cheap
1.0,TWO PAIR OF SOCKS FOR $38.98 NOT ONLY A RIPOFF BUT WILL BE REPORTED TOO AMAZON BUT THE BBB
1.0,I ordered these for my daughter to wear playing hockey. From the picture they look like they would go to her knee but there are crew length. I tried to return them but I would have to pay to ship them back. I didn‚Äôt want to pay $3.66 to return them so she will wear them for everyday use instead of for hockey.
1.0,"Buckle needs to be ground down more. The teeth to hold the buckle to the belt, perforate the belt not just hold it in place.  The edges of the buckle shave the edges of the belt up to the stitching.  If you have a spare tire the buckle will cut your tire. Expect to be pinched by the ratchet release."
1.0,does not hold boobs in place that are d cup just fyi
1.0,Broke first time wearing it extremely cheap
1.0,You need to go up at least 2 sizes up. Body cloth material is super thin and cheap.
1.0,This dress looked so great in the pictures but that‚Äôs not the dress I received. It was so thin and flimsy and cheap! So disappointed!
1.0,The v neck did not slope off shoulder like in the picture. The shirt was too big and I bought a medium.
1.0,Horrible.  Not as advertised.  Cannot wear.  Straps are too long and not adjustable.  The cross straps are flimsy lace and provide no support.
1.0,I thought I ordered Smart Fit Shoes. It totally was some knock off cheaply made no brand shoe!!!!!! And it was even the right size!!!!!
1.0,This stud is huge - it sticks way up and is much too big to wear in your nose.
1.0,"Looks great, but was too small for me. Tried to return but it's so complicating so I just gave it away."
1.0,It looks cheap I didn't like it at all.
1.0,"Terrible quality, loose strands. Fabric reminds me of a cheap Halloween costume or a graduation down for children. Had to send it back."
1.0,"does not fit, made for a child"
1.0,"I bought this for a wedding, but when it arrived the sleeve were sewn on backwards.<br />In the pictures, the sleeves open at the front. In mine the larger, closed part was on the front with the opening on the back of my arm. It looked ridiculous and was clearly put on the wrong way around."
1.0,Very poor finish!  I will not be wearing this.
1.0,I need a refund. The Jacket was way smaller than what was advertised
1.0,I knew to expect it to be on the smaller side but it was way too small for the size.
1.0,"Way too small! They say they updated sizing to US sizing but it‚Äôs way off...I normally wear size 8/10 with no problem. I bought the 10/12 in this jacket and I could barely get it on let alone zip it! My aunt who is a size 2 could barley even fit in it. Also, the size I ordered was prime and it didn‚Äôt even ship until like 5 days later. Came way later then expected! Btw, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and about 140 lbs"
1.0,They show you get two in different sizes I only received one and it's so small I can't fit a crystal inside
1.0,I shop Amazon all the time! This ankle chain is beautiful however broke within the first 24 hours of wearing it! So disappointing! Never would of questioned purchasing everything and anything from this site but going forward I will. Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,"‚ÄîFeel free to ask me any questions about my review!‚Äî<br /><br />The sizing is fine and the Material is thick which is why I am so sad about this skort! I returned it because it has these weird Triangle cut outs in the side and they added Extra fabric but it looks weird and ruins the skirt. It would be fine otherwise. Bummer! It just looks odd.<br /><br />This product runs true to size. I ordered a small, which is my usual size, and it fits. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 140 lbs, and a size 4 for reference.<br /><br />I hope my description was of use to you!<br /><br />‚ÄîFollow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram for more amazing Amazon finds!‚Äî"
1.0,Broke after wearing 2 times
1.0,Wrong size and poorly printed
1.0,One bra has hooks on each side instead of hook and eye.
1.0,This is not the same quality as the original band for Nano Vista glasses.  The clasp of the band broke after a single use.
1.0,The screen print is faded and looks cheap. Very disappointed. Way too small and ordered larger size. I feel like the advertisement is misleading and doesn‚Äôt look as nice in person.
1.0,"Very disappointed with item .. I have a small head and face and this does not cover my chin and nose area at same time. I waited a long time to get them, and to have them arrive and not be able to wear them I was very upset. I will tell my friends NO to order this fake item.."
1.0,"i love the stripes and colors, but unfortunately,  its too small for me.  boo hoo"
1.0,"The instructions on how to use the shorteners is very inadequate. I do not believe that I am dumb, but I cannot figure it out how it works. The product needs better instructions and a step by step pictures. So, right now they are in drawer, until someone with PhD can show me how this works."
1.0,"Plastic bag was ripped open, sandals were not in hanger and leather is scratched in several places. This was supposed to be a father‚Äôs day gift and I am extremely disappointed with this purchase!"
1.0,I have the fleeced lined ones and have no problem with them.  These come up higher and then roll down and dig in at the waist.
1.0,The fabric was hard. If you live in Florida you would start sweating immediately. A medium was too large and it did not look as flattering as in the picture.
1.0,The material was really cheap and the size was too big. I would give no stars if it were possible.
1.0,Not worth rating üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº
1.0,"looks very cheap, bad fishy ordor on pants and pants do not look like the photo- they do do not have the raised ridges and look like garbage bag material-not a leather look at all.  Runs large"
1.0,"Trash! To small. Ordered Extra Large and it fit like a medium/small. Good material, but not for a compression fit. Rolls down your legs. DO NOT BUY this product for the purpose it is suppose to serve."
1.0,Way too small and the seller doesn't even accept refunds.
1.0,Ordered a 2x and it came in and didn't even fit my roommate who wears an xs. It was super disappointing.
1.0,Fit is horrible. I couldn't even get my foot in them and I wear a narrow.
1.0,Beware: The color is in no way as brilliant at as the picture suggests. The colors were very faded and muted. I sent it right back. Didn‚Äôt even bother taking a picture.
1.0,Worst fitting mask I have brought yet I like the idea of it going around the back because I just cant stand anything on the back of my ears. But the fit on the nose cuts into my noses
1.0,"Time changes all the time, I set it and next time I look at it it's wrong again"
1.0,"Just like everyone else, I found out the hard way that the description is inaccurate and fraudulent. Now I have to take time to send back lenses that DID NOT fit despite a claim saying they would. After all the complaints, how are they even allowed to sell on Amazon?"
1.0,I ordered a size 42. It would fit maybe a 38 because it is missized. Wasted $6 of my money‚Äã returning it because it was not marked correctly.
1.0,Loved the idea of this and when I tried it on briefly it was fine. But when I actually wore it - the bra did not stick at all. I wore it out and I constantly had to keep adjusting it so it wouldn‚Äôt fall off me.
1.0,"This is the second dress I've ordered from this seller and the second one I can't wear. According to the size chart, I should fit a large. So, the first one I ordered was a large. And OMG it was HUGE!! I could have fit TWO of me in that thing. It was gigantic!! So, I thought, ok, sizing might be off. Dress might run big. I'll try a small. Ordered a small. The dress was so tiny I couldnt get it past my teenie tiny boobs!! It was probably 4 times smaller than the gigantic large.<br />So, I give up. It's a pretty looking dress but, the sizing is a gamble so I'm not ordering anymore.üòï"
1.0,Buttons are too small and do not sit properly in button holes. Will likely return them
1.0,I ordered the 12 headbands and received 12 wristbands instead. I don't need to keep the sweat off of my fingers.

1.0,"Daughter loved this necklace, unfortunately when she opened it the glass piece fell off and basically looked like a hunk of junk. And it was past the time I could return.  Unimpressed and currently trying to glue this back together."
1.0,Not as described. Tried to return but I needed to pay for shipping return and it was all the way to China so I ended up keeping. Very cheap quality. This is why I don‚Äôt like to buy clothes from Amazon.
1.0,only 1 work
1.0,"Too small, the fabric is cheap and NOT at all breathable. It is also SUPER rough and itchy. Very disappointed."
1.0,This dress  was very poor quality.  One arm opening was bigger than the other.  It did not fit as indicated
1.0,It looks very ugly and it‚Äôs longer than the picture. It has a lot of fabric and is too tight in the breast area.
1.0,Look cheap so I returned them.
1.0,These have caused more of a head ache than not wearing them does. I don‚Äôt use them anymore.
1.0,I don't even want to give it a star!! The stones are falling out. It was a gift and I feel horrible about the quality!
1.0,This product did not clean my sliver necklace at all!!!!
1.0,It has started to fall apart after the first wash.
1.0,Just received it yesterday and it is not what I expected. Smaller than pictured. The smallest  bag has a lock and it won't open. The purse is too small. This will be returned.
1.0,it was cheap and broke the first day worn! dont waste any money on this junk! terrible terrible terrible terrible
1.0,"This product is longer in the length than in the photo, making it a little less scandalous. Also if you have larger chest measurements you‚Äôre gonna need sticky tape to keep the cleavage slit in place.<br /><br />Good luck!"
1.0,I followed the size chart but it was somewhat too small.
1.0,"It had potential. Although the fabric is cheap, it looked pretty cute out of the bag. However, an hour after I put it on the bottom of my left inseam had come apart. (2‚Äù separation) My pocket on the same side completely came undone when I put my hand into it. Hand. Not an extremely heavy object, or even normal weighted object. Just, my hand. I was naive. I read the reviews and thought, not me! Welp. Me, and probably you too. I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again and do not recommend the product."
1.0,Chwaply made with cheap material. My real issue is this didn't look like the photo. The bottom has a similar pint but is made differently.
1.0,This mask is tiny. Oils maybe fit a 3 year old. Terrible quality.
1.0,Just say no.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:785febf6fe9290b6e086eca50378aa9]] Requested the black one because of loose powder and fall out<br /><br />This is what the sent<br /><br />Cute but really wanted the black one
1.0,The bag came in Canal St. packaging. All creased and misshaped. Had to return it and buy a different bag for my anniversary present. Not worth the price
1.0,This was returned to Amazon.  It‚Äôs absolute garbage and the lights don‚Äôt even come on.
1.0,Not shimmery at all.  Very sheer but I wasn‚Äôt looking for that.  I tried them on and when I took them off they had a run in them.  I usually can wear a pair at least 2-3 times before that happens.
1.0,This is just not a great buy
1.0,Ordered a size Large and it feels like a small. Couldn't even get my hand halfway in the gloves.
1.0,Worked 2 weeks. couldn't be fixed.  loser.
1.0,This dress is just a disaster.<br />Too big in chest too snug in the waist with pockets that pucker at the waist. The colors are off from the picture as well. Just awful.<br />Returning.
1.0,"They look nice, but that's about it."
1.0,It is literally a $1 item‚Ä¶
1.0,"I expected a sweatshirt type material. Probably a lightweight summer evening pull on affair.<br /><br />The shirt is a thin, slippery, slinky, nearly transparent cheap polyester knit about the weight you'd expect in a cheap Walmart nightgown.<br /><br />Don't fret I doubt it will shrink, there's not a bit of cotton in it."
1.0,I just got this sport bra a month ago and wore it maybe twice and the zip came off when it got out of the washer.
1.0,"Cute when recieved, however one of the bands doesnt snap into place properly, making it completely unwearable."
1.0,This was very thin and the fit was VERY small.  I wear a 2x and ordered a 4x....still way too small.
1.0,The apron is plastic
1.0,"Earrings are paper thin, not good quality at all. Feels like the metal they would use for dollar store jewelry. Definitely not worth $10. These will probably break after a couple uses. I‚Äôll be returning for better quality earrings. They also don‚Äôt come with any type of metal backing- just a rubber cover."
1.0,"I got a smaller size and it was still hugs.  Plus it has no shape to it and just looks like I'm wearing a trash bag.  When I contacted the seller with these concerns, they stated they would not send me a paid return label.  Poor."
1.0,Was to small around the lower seam. It does not drape at all and I ordered a size bigger than I am
1.0,"Product was not as expected.  Material cheap, size is smaller than expected.  Would not recommend."
1.0,"I should have read the complete description. I hate when the main description says it's woven leather. It's cheap pleather, not woven at all, just stamped to make it kind of look woven. The strap is really long & not adjustable. I really regret this purchase. Can find better at the $1 store. Don't waist your money."
1.0,Fell apart in no time.
1.0,I have other colors which are nice but the yellow is see through... I ordered L and they were see through... I bought a XXL just to make sure the material isn‚Äôt stretching but they were still completely see through.
1.0,This top was just delivered today. I took it out of the packaging and immediately noticed the strap was not attached to the front of the tank. I THEN noticed the button at the back was busted as well. The loop closure is detached. I was really looking forward to wearig this top for my engagement pictures but will be returning instead. 0/10 legit not a single thing about this top is redeeming after these defects
1.0,Poor material quality. Sizing not accurate.
1.0,Cheap cheap cheaply made
1.0,"Good color. Good price.<br />They are cheap for a reason, avoid this Co. And these thin, failing threads."
1.0,"Beautiful suit but torso too short. And I'm 5,3&#34;"
1.0,This was a gift .The band was hard to open .It was wore twice and didn't keep correct time.The 3rd time to wear it wouldn't run at all.
1.0,To small I returned
1.0,Very sloppy fit!! Hangs longer in the front and I'm always pulling it back!!
1.0,It was way too big for my big kid and too big for me a grownup!
1.0,"The image on the shorts in the photo doesn‚Äôt match up to the shorts we received. The fabric is thin and synthetic like pajama fabric. Item runs small, I would recommend ordering up two full sizes from your normal. This item is cute for pajamas, if sized properly, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these for out and about wear."
1.0,Cheaply made.  I gave it away.
1.0,"Low quality, not worth it"
1.0,The crown came unraveled before I even got to use it!  So disappointed!!
1.0,These pants suck! I wore them in the rain recently and despite the advertisement they are not fully waterproof. The area at both knees is a breathable non-waterproof material that allows water to seep through. This defeats the purpose of waterproof pants.
1.0,"Wish I could give this a zero. These cufflinks came and I was all excited, except they're so poor quality the one was already broken off before I open the ziploc bag. Quite unfortunate, waste of money"
1.0,I bought this in a small black and medium red. The red was extremely big while the Black was extremely small! I really don‚Äôt understand how. I thought for sure one would be the perfect fit.<br />The red was much too big everywhere fit  more like xl. The material was also much stretchier than the black material. The black one was so small especially  in the arms.
1.0,Torso/waist chest is cut unusually short. Almost as if a child was used as a fit model during the design of the pattern. Not what the picture looks like
1.0,Product fit is terrible! Shirt was made in China. They must have different body types than the US. Will never buy this brand again.
1.0,Arrived badly tarnished. Very large and heavy as well. Returned.
1.0,"This material is seriously awful. It's stiff, cheap, unflattering, and forever wrinkled."
1.0,"I wanted to like this jacket, but when I got it, pulled it out of the box, I tried too unzip it to try it on, but could not get the zipper undone. I had to send it back. Im sure its a great jacket, if the zipper works. Mine did not."
1.0,No way this enormous hat fits a one year old. This was a waste of money.
1.0,Shoe strings are to short. Shoe cushion are not that comfortable. Like the design of the boots.
1.0,Discoloration/ defective print.
1.0,"Never fit, slipped off constantly, not even remotely useful."
1.0,I love the look of this shirt but regrettably the blue runs and makes marks on the white.  No I do not use bleach.
1.0,I ordered the size 8K I received a 4K but I kept it because the stone was so pretty. Its fulfilled by Amazon. I ordered 6 of these pendants . Of the 6 I kept 2 because they were the wrong size.  The stones are very nice but you gamble on getting the right size stone.
1.0,Cheap material...way too big. No salwar...just a small piece of cheap cloth. The delivery was quick
1.0,Design wore off after a week
1.0,I‚Äôve never wrote a review but these bags are so horrible I just had to. I used them maybe twice and the little inside pocket has already came off and the bag itself is tearing apart. I should have listened to the other reviews. Don‚Äôt be like me! It‚Äôs so pointless to buy ‚Äúreusable‚Äù bags that fall apart and just have to be thrown away after two uses. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have Walmart bags that have lasted longer!
1.0,"This item looks cheap and not worth what a paid for it. I purchased it to be given as a gift and now have to find something else to replace it and I am out the cost of this item as well. I do not recommend it to anyone and the person who gave it 5 stars must be the seller or one of their friends because no way is this a 5 star item. I am very disappointed , I paid 50.00 plus shipping."
1.0,Hooks  do not line up With namebrand bras. Very frustrating. Would not buy again. Comes unhooked while you are trying to hook the rest of them. Bunches a little if you get them to stay hooked
1.0,No recibo nada
1.0,It looks like a 5 year old sewed it together...
1.0,Horrible moooo
1.0,"I ordered this during a lightning deal so the cardigan was pretty cheap. I wasn't expecting great quality but I thought it would at least look wearable. When I put it on it just looked overly long and just plain boring, if not sloppy. There was absolutely nothing special about it and personally it looked like something you'd buy at a Dollar Store. The material is very, very thin. I wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I even tried to give it to my 13 year old daughter and even she didn't like it. (I thought maybe she'd wear it because she's not very picky and clothes generally look better on her, as she has a model type body and nearly everything looks good on her.) Anyhow, needless to say, I returned the cardigan. I will say that I LOVE how easy Amazon returns are when you can just take the item to UPS and they package it for you. This is one of those items which is nice. Even my husband can deal with that without calling me haha!"
1.0,I couldn't get these over my leg at all and I loosened them all the way up.  Very cheap and my legs arent huge
1.0,Smaller than described. I returned them.
1.0,Was not what I expected. I wanted them for working out and they have no give. Super soft but just not good for what I needed.
1.0,I bought them for my ears they fell apart in my hands when I try to put them on how cheap can you get I‚Äôm so disappointed
1.0,Stones fell out 2nd time I wore them. 4 missing in one and 8 missing in the other one. Now sharp where stones are missing. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,"So unbeliveably bad that your adolescent children could have done an equal or better job.  In this case, I really blame Amazon because ... up until now ... I had not received junk from them before.  It is not that I didn't notice the incredibly low prices, but I gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt ... assuming that they were using the jewelry as a loss leader (a promotional incentive), but I was fooled badly.  Don't fall into the same trap.  Carmen"
1.0,To big for my wittle boobs
1.0,This is does not fit. It would only fit a child or a very skinny ankle.
1.0,Nothing like it appears online!!!
1.0,Letters just fall off. Each letter is barely glued on
1.0,"I really had high hopes for this outfit. Unfortunately, I never even got to fully try it on. Immediately out of the package as I was unfolding it to lay it out I heard a small snap. Like thread breaking. Once I laid the piece down....the entire sleeve had unraveled. It doesn't even appear to have been stitched. And i paid for faster shipping for an unbearable item. To say that I am upset is an understatement. I tried to figure out a way to quickly repair since I planned on wearing it tonight but its impossiblem. Its going back immediately. I did however try on the skirt. I got the set in a medium. I am 5&quot;10 with 43 hips and it is hella short. No room for error. I do plan on purchasing this item again in hopes that I get a better garment. But as for this one, in really hoping this was a simple mistake. This is my third purchase from this company. The first dress was gorgeous. This one was a big a55 disappointment."
1.0,I ordered these socks because they where listed as having grippers. They were for my aunt in a nursing home. She had to remove them to walk so she doesn't slip and fall.
1.0,I was very disappointed when the product clearly states you get 48 and I only received 10. RIP OFF!
1.0,wore them once and they turned within that same week. They are beautiful though.
1.0,"It came damaged, que no button in the hand, I don't know why, too bad"
1.0,Bad quality but for the price?
1.0,When i got the pants in they looked like they came from wish. The quality was very poor AND the button fell off in my hand. so i immediately asked for a refund and have yet to get it.
1.0,"It said it was a man‚Äôs watch, but the band was barely long enough to fit around my husband‚Äôs wrist and he is not a huge or heavy man."
1.0,pretty but very sharp and scratched my wrist.  not easy to put on.
1.0,They were to tight and felt uncomfortable I had to return them
1.0,DOA but nice styling how good is that?
1.0,My second screaching cat was disappointing! Doesn‚Äôt work off sensor like the original purchased one
1.0,The worst stitching and shape you could ever think of!
1.0,The ring is veryy small abd its not the same than the picture its a fraud i hate the ring its so diferent than the picture i hate a lot
1.0,"Buying cheap sunglasses, I know what i'm getting.  I didn't expect anything fancy, but these are really bad.  They sit awkwardly on my face and just don't work at all"
1.0,I am so sorry about this purchase. I was so excited to get the purse I thought it was so cute and I love Crossbody bags. So it came I opened it and I‚Äôm trying to open it to check for paper etc. inside the purse. First however you‚Äôre supposed open this was not a class that was included with my degree. You should be able to unlatch it and pull it open but it is so difficult to open and then it takes you 5 to 10 minutes to get it closed again. I will probably give it to one of my daughters to Use from middle school. I didn‚Äôt know maybe some WD-40 would help.  I‚Äôm not even able to return because I didn‚Äôt save my packaging I was so sure I was going to love it. üò≠
1.0,I don‚Äôt recommend this shirt.
1.0,Please do not buy
1.0,I wear a 2xl and could not even button this shirt up. More like a large. Beautiful colors and nice looking but way too small.
1.0,This item is defective after a few weeks of wear<br /><br />Band detaches from insert
1.0,"WAY too small, it barely shows"
1.0,It turned rusty and black.
1.0,I ordered a large for my mother-in-law's birthday and it was too small. She normally wears a medium. Very disappointed because now she thinks she's fat.
1.0,"Wore this ONE TIME. While I was wearing it, the part of the band that connects to the watch came off because of a screw that didnt hold it together, dropping my watch on the ground and cracking my screen. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
1.0,No me agrado el material de una sola lavada se da√±o la tela
1.0,Unfortunately I waited too late to return. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
1.0,The wallet holds cards with tension.  After two weeks the tension has weakened.  The cards fall out the wallet.  The wallet is now useless.  Don't buy
1.0,i like the bracelet it is very thick heavy now i would like to know why is the bracelet twisted it will npt stay straight .if i cannot get a reasonable answer i would like to return it
1.0,Very thin and they run very small in fingers.
1.0,Got here to day broken
1.0,THIS OUTFIT IS BEAUTIFUL BUT THE SIZING IS VERY DECEIVING. IT RUNS VERY VERY VERY SMALLLLLLLLLLLLL.......... SUCH A DISABPORNTMENT. THEY SHOULD BE CLEAR AND LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE SIZE.
1.0,Very loose collar and shirt is made of what seems to be cheap fabric.
1.0,"I bought 3 of these in diff. colors but the same size and they ALL FIT DIFFERENT. Even the fabric was diff. quality for each dress. Didn't even remotely reach my ankles and I'm only 5'5&#34;! Seller only refunded 40%. Don't waste your money here ladies, there's plenty of better quality dresses for the same price."
1.0,I typically wear an XS but that wasn‚Äôt an option so I went with the small. This was really small. Additionally the stiching was terrible. I have added photos to show the weird arching on it. Finally it was really sheer. This wouldn‚Äôt have been enough for me to return it but it did seal the deal for me.
1.0,This hate is very poorly made and the image is blurry.
1.0,They are very pretty but the earring that goes in the right ear is straight not curved like the left one.  Very disappointed that I can't wear them!
1.0,I only received on earring
1.0,Wasnt as I expected a very light jacket
1.0,"This product does NOT look like the picture. The tassels are not multicolored like the picture, they are all blue. The pattern is not as cute as it is in the picture, it is much larger stripes and does not look at all like the picture. There are loose strings all over where the tassels hang from. Not impressed."
1.0,These are Cheap made-in-China-quality. Not what you want to put on your feet everyday.
1.0,Turning pink already. I‚Äôve ordered 3 of these and none of them have done that. Very disappointed
1.0,"I was pretty sure ordering a cheap suit on Amazon was a bad idea.  The only thing that arrived was a poorly packaged funny smelling suit jacket.  No pants, no vest.  The quality looked very subpar as well.  Do yourself a favor and just search the clearance racks or try Ross."
1.0,"Edges are far too ""sharp"" to push them into an 8 guage hole."
1.0,It was thin but not what material I was looking for
1.0,A lot smaller than I was expecting. The pictures show that this ring is a lot prettier than what it shows when it gets delivered to you. Was happy when I received it!
1.0,"1 star only because it wasn't what we expected. Bought the pants for a costume, under the impression of a different material, but the material is more like a shiny pleather. Afraid if moved around too much it would rip. Seemed very cheaply made and not at all the quality I would hope for. I did return it as there was no way I could trust the pants to be worn."
1.0,"I loved the way that this watch looked, but I have ordered two of this style/brand since Christmas and BOTH of them have broken within a very short span of time.  This last one only barely outlasted the cut-off date for returns, so I am stuck with it.  I only wish I could give it zero stars."
1.0,"This was advertised as linen / Cotton and it is not. It is the cheapest, thinnest, and most transparent fabric I have ever seen, comparable only to the tourist trap shops in southeast asia...<br /><br />You can wrap yourself in single ply Toilet Paper and it would feel more like wearing clothes than if you wear these pants.<br /><br />I returned them of course and I found $19 dollars linen pants on Old Navy that while not a luxury, is thicker, better cut, and an actual piece of clothing."
1.0,"As some others have pointed out, including A. M. Behr this doesn't appear to be authentic merchandise. Sad fact of Amazon shopping. I normally buy directly from the WWE store, but I can't find the Rise Above Hate message on shirts or hats anymore. I took a chance on this and it is as A.M. described it is: thin, cheap, and low quality. I tossed everything but the t-shirt and will probably turn that into an art project because the quality is so poor I doubt it would survive a wash."
1.0,"I was so excited to get a brand new Simon bracelet, but as soon as I open the box I knew it was not a real one. Cheap looking, you can get the same one at Old Navy for $9.95. It‚Äôs definitely not worth the money $148. Returned !"
1.0,The pattern was cool the shirt was nice but where it cuts on a normal 20-year-old was right across the chest which didn‚Äôt fit correctly. Very disappointed because it is a cute shirt
1.0,They fit like regular under shirts. No  Compression whatsoever.
1.0,"The top and bottom were 2 totally different colors of red. One was a dark maroon color, the other was more a fire engine red. Didn't even match!"
1.0,"August 8, 2012 - First Impression: This is exactly what i was hoping to find! I needed some replacement necklaces for me and my girlfriend for a purchase i made a while back on some puzzle piece necklaces [[ASIN:B00220CGQM M+Y STEEL Love Puzzle Couples Pendant]]. The necklaces provided with the puzzle piece pendants were not very strong so i finally decided to just buy a new pair and i found this. Such a bargain! Two for basically the price of one! You are definitely getting more than what you pay for! Would buy again! Definitely recommend this product!<br /><br />--------------EDIT!!!!<br /><br />February 25, 2013 - Truth: It has been a couple of months since i first purchased these chains. These chains are all nice and bright when you first get them but after a bit of time wearing them they turn your neck green! Mine and my girlfriends necks started t itch after a while and we started to wonder why. It turns out it was these chains, my girlfriend told me one day that my neck was green and it was. I even got a small wart that was never there and i think it's safe to say this was the cause as well! Just a bit of FYI, I took complete care of this chain, took it off before the shower, waited till i was dry to put it on, made sure i wouldn't be sweating while i was wearing it, took it off before going to bed and the whole nine. I will definitely NOT be buying ANY of these EVER again."
1.0,Cheap..the color is two toned. 2 diff colors of blue and is deff not navy. The star in back was glued on and half ripped off. It fit fine but would deff NOT recommend it. I was hoping for the model pic. NOPE NOPE NOPE
1.0,Broke the second time i used them
1.0,"Did not inflate, looked used, muddy boot prints on product.  Use for 6 yr old granddaughter when she comes to vist.  Opened for the first time today, so disappointing."
1.0,These have to be a kid‚Äôs belt!!! Poor quality:(
1.0,Not happy at all. The package arrived and the cap on the bottle was loose. Maybe 1/4 of an inch of product in bottle left to use
1.0,"I have to return it because it ran small for me. I can usually wear XL dresses but this one was extremely tight, especially around the arms."
1.0,The worst dress ever dosen't look like in the pic fabric very heavy.  It's just horrible.
1.0,Leaves permanent black marks on pillow cases - bad product.
1.0,I like the look but the sizing was way off! Fits on the waist but if you are not extremely large on the top... I would pass on it
1.0,"I loved the design and was super stoked to wear this for our upcoming Disney trip. I put on the dress and was not happy. From the looks of the picture, it looked like it would be above the knees. No,it was gown style and the material was not only uncomfy but it was super poofy."
1.0,"This is most likely stolen art. The cast of critical role do not endorse this or want outside sellers mass producing their brand to sell. Just get official merchandise, or commission the ACTUAL artist of this piece to make one if they're able to."
1.0,They were trashed before the first night of wearing them was over. Very disappointing.
1.0,I was excited to have this for Saint Patrick's Day but the shirt is a neon yellow-green.  It is not Kelly green at all.
1.0,"These are very thin cheaply made and extremely too small not true to size, I ordered a 7/8 for my son and I received them they were like a 4T terrible sending them back! Save your money keep looking!"
1.0,"Update: after many emails the seller has agreed to provide a full refund. The coat is not of good quality so I'll leave my one star, but at least the customer service improved.<br />-----<br />I followed the size chart and the fit is just off. Too big in some places, too small in others. And the coat is so cheap looking and the feel of the fabric is almost like steel wool. It does not look like it does in the advertisement. I wanted to return it but the seller won't pay for return shipping. They only offered to give me a 50% refund. The coat isn't even worth 50% of what I paid for it. And because they're an independent seller who can set their own policies Amazon won't get involved. Horrible customer service for a horrible product. Don't bother with this coat or this seller. I wish I could leave zero stars."
1.0,The band it cute but VERY Large. To big for me.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt hold any of my stones
1.0,"Cheap quality. It left dark marks all over my hands and dress, so wear with dark clothing only. After one wear, several links came apart and were missing, so I can't wear it anymore. Make sure you inspect and close the metal links with plyers since there are gaps, and they will fall off. I doubt cleaning it will prevent any of the metal from rubbing off tho."
1.0,"Don't loose your money whit this. Completely different from the description, and the material with which it is made is of poor quality."
1.0,Watch does not work!
1.0,"Not even close to photo. Sort of the same color, but fit is ridiculously bad.<br />Also this literally came on the slow boat from China. I ordered this in July, delivered in mid November, so keep that in mind."
1.0,"Like many clothing items I have purchased off Amazon, it came from China and is to small."
1.0,I bought this dress from the seller in black and navy in the same size. The navy one was way too small and a different brand. Complete waste time.
1.0,From what my daughter says ‚Äúit‚Äôs cheap‚Äù.
1.0,"Didn't do much...probably should buy bigger pants!  Good idea, though."
1.0,Returned this product.  The material it's made from is cheap and disgusting.
1.0,They broke during the first use. I opened and closed them maybe about 4 times and the hinge came off.
1.0,"This is made of cheap, paperlike material that makes ridiculous noise everytime you move."
1.0,This material make me look bulky
1.0,Too stiff! Needs to be more pliable. Come on now...
1.0,Horrible dress. Nothing like the picture. It does not run big at all. You have to buy a dress 3x bigger than your regular size to get close to this style
1.0,This product was one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I threw them out. The size was a disaster. Big some places too small others. The pants also came complete with two different holes; one on the ankle and one on the waist and strings were hanging from the seams. Awful!!!
1.0,The fabric is awful! So cheap like felt costume fabric:(
1.0,It's a pretty color but is definitely too long.
1.0,"I ordered 2 different styles of this dress  - did not receive either one of them. One dress is supposed to be short - it is long, the other is supposed to be short sleeved, it is long sleeved. But I could maybe have lived with that if the material wasn't so cheap and award looking and feeling. The fabric description says &#34;cotton blend&#34; - that must be code for completely synthetic slip like material. It is shiny and stretchy and the print is nothing as shown in the picture - although bear in mind, that I didn't get what I ordered, so... Plus, the dress, size small is huge. I am 5 ft 4 in and about 115 lb and I would need a belt, and it would still drown me. Too bad."
1.0,&#34;One size fits all&#34; so it says. I usually wear a L- XL  .This hat was very uncomfortable to wear being tight in the temples. It actually gave me a headache after wearing just a couple of hours.  My wife tried to make modifications to no avail. It's in the trash!  Too bad seemed like nice fabric and color.(brown)
1.0,"The dress is completely SHEER with no liner or anything!! What on earth! Horrible, don‚Äôt waste your money on this."
1.0,La Talla es XL china
1.0,Cheaply made colors clash... junk... returning this product!
1.0,Extremely small even with the larger sizes. Fabric was extremely poor quality
1.0,"After watching the incredible 2 for one offer from Zoomies TV infomercial, I am 300% satisfied that Amazon customer feedback has saved me once again from buying a product that sounds 300% useless!!! THANK YOU AMAZON!!!"
1.0,Well didn‚Äôt fit as a shaper more like underwear
1.0,"The quality seems okay, but the item I received is not the item I ordered. I ordered footless tights, but received footed tights. Very disappointing. It‚Äôs too late to return these and order more."
1.0,The stones in the charm turned a chalky white color after wearing for about a week. Would love to return for something else!!!
1.0,Actually returned this product. Thin and cheaply made.
1.0,I bought them thinking they are soft and easy to wear on wrist. They are very stiff and gives a bad plastic feel.
1.0,This was too big!!! An extra small was the size of a large. Will never buy this again.
1.0,"I loved this and thought it was super cute, wore it less than 2 dozen times and it has a hole and strings coming off of it. It be catches the eye in an unflattering way. I didn‚Äôt expect it to last forever but I hoped it would at least last a month."
1.0,The decal is very blurry. Not good quality at all. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Not worn ones and broke by trying to put the pendant on. Would not buy it again.
1.0,Sent vack
1.0,This would be the perfect shorts if the zipper didn‚Äôt break right away. I would also suggest that the waist rope had a stopper on it to prevent it from coming completely off!
1.0,"VERY SMALL. I have small diameter glasses but these just didn‚Äôt fit around them. They look like a great product but just did fit. I tried to measure but unless your glasses are rectangular and narrow, they will be difficult to fit."
1.0,These are the worst goggles I‚Äôve ever purchased. We could not get them to stay tight at all. They kept coming loose and falling off. The rims around the lenses are so cheap and flimsy that they wouldn‚Äôt keep the water out anyways.
1.0,"Sent this back!  It doesn't look anything like the pictures.  The texture is jersey, not knit, and there is no blue in this at all.  Bummer because I really wanted what I saw in the picture.  If you do too, keep looking."
1.0,Misleading. There is no mermaid shape on the back pack. It's just the blue and purple colors. Mermaid material. Disappointing.
1.0,"I would give the men's mask no stars, the ladies one is much better. Dont get the set. I bot the blue phantom and ladies blue masquerade set. The material quality is fine, but the mens mask is tragically horrible."
1.0,The pants is a perfect fit but the jacket is horribly small as if the two don't go together and is not slim fit completely useless
1.0,Frame snapped first time I tried to change the lens...total crap
1.0,This is junk. Washed one time falling apart. Contacted seller with no response 3 times. Only 1 month old
1.0,"Even tho I ordered the large, the slippers are tiny!  American feet are good sized.  They are really cute and am hoping it will not be long before a grandchild can wear them."
1.0,"Cheap plastic...earring broken.  am sending back, very disappointed."
1.0,Have to drill the hole in yourself. Wasted money.
1.0,"Does not fit my fitbit versa 2. The straps were made wrong. It is possible that I could have just gotten a bad one. Either way, it didn't fit no matter how I tried to put them on."
1.0,"Stones fall out, don't waste your money."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt receive the silicone beads.
1.0,I felt that it ran a slight bit small. I don‚Äôt like that it was boxy. I also thing the material was thinner than expected and cheap feeling. I returned it.
1.0,"The pattern on each of the masks is adorable, esp for disposable kids‚Äô masks. HOWEVER, every mask has yellow discoloring going through them, as if their printer was running out of ink. Now I have a junk pile of Among Us, Spider-Man & Avenger masks‚Ä¶.disappointing!"
1.0,"Daughter LOVED this watch band, but was highly disappointed when it came broke 2x! The watch band seemed like it was not glued or sewn and never stayed together. We ordered a second one and same thing. Returned them both and waiting for my refund."
1.0,"I returned this item, it was listed as 925 sterling silver and it is not"
1.0,Material muy pl√°stico
1.0,Too tight. Better if you buy columbia gloves
1.0,"Gloves üß§ fitted just right, but it doesn't keep your fingers warm"
1.0,I'm 5'1 this dress went to my mid calf. And it wasn't as tight as i had wanted it. I wasn't i big fan of the fabric either. Felt like i was wearing a wind breaker.
1.0,"USED. These shoes have been used but were not advertised this way. The shoes arrived wrapped in paper with scuffs, stains, creases, chips in the materials, and bows held to the shoes with safety pins. I am returning this item."
1.0,"This product is so poorly made...I bought a pair and one of them broke the second time I used it.  The plastic nut inside the shoe stretcher broke.  When I received a replacement, the same thing happened.  The wood inside is not even shellacked.  This is what you get for stuff made in China.  The only reason I gave it one-star is because if the product was better quality, it actually works in stretching the shoes."
1.0,"I got a large because I am kinda chubby, and was met with pants made for a long, spider legged, model of a woman. Much too long, and I can't wear them."
1.0,Junk but they refunded.....
1.0,Too small not adjustable
1.0,Nice but too long. I returned
1.0,"Looks like a student of home economics in middle school made this shirt! Not impressed, will never wear! üëéüèº"
1.0,Not what I expected....to small...this is junior sizes ladies.. isn't women's sizes.
1.0,"Knecklace broke within two weeks and they don't replace because of breakage, then what's the point?  Not worth it!!!!!"
1.0,You can make these without all the excess for a fraction of price
1.0,Me qued√© con las ganas.  Se me rompieron al intentar pon√©rmelas!
1.0,did  not fit
1.0,I bought the Enimay Women's Jean Look Leggings Tights Pants Floral Design Fashion... I received the wrong pattern. They fit rather snug but the fit. Thinking perhaps there was a error I passed the first pair on to my daughter and re ordered the same pattern. Guess what.. wrong pattern again. Will not be ordering from this company again.
1.0,Horrible purchase! Doesn't even fit as a shirt it's so small!!!
1.0,Turns your neck green. You get what you pay for.
1.0,Metal is very dull.. shape is indefinite and does not look much like a starfish‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt waste your money!
1.0,No sirven para mi tengo mucho busto. Realmente son peque√±os aun en su talla mas grande
1.0,"This wig looks crazy. Do not buy, unless you want a weird bump on the crown of your head! Also they don‚Äôt do free refunds. So now I have to pay almost $4 to return the hideous thing! Ugh. Whyyyyyy"
1.0,It did not fit on the visors of three vehicles - very disappointing
1.0,"Very, very  disappointed .Poorly made , looks very cheap and it‚Äôs extreamly larger ."
1.0,Way too small. I rarely return things on Amazon but this went back
1.0,It broke the next day . Cheap stuff
1.0,When this was delivered it came all rubbery and soft and didn‚Äôt even look close to what I had ordered. The face was weird and it smelled like burnt plastic.
1.0,The fit was fine - until they went into the wash and shrunk by more than half their size.
1.0,"I thought that could get my prescription lens put in these frames because I liked the style, but everywhere I went told me they could not put my lens in because the frames would melt.  So I just wasted my money on these and I can't even use them."
1.0,I‚Äôm not sure if this is just the jackets that I received. I bought one white jacket and one tan jacket in both of them have a ton of lose seams. So disappointed bc these are great material and super cute!
1.0,It broke with one use
1.0,The dress was very pretty but had to return because of the sleeves not fitting well on my daughter. Maybe it was just the one we got. Maybe going up a size will help with this but then maybe it will be to big in other places.
1.0,I bought this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer. When I read the package it contains lead. My daughter has sickle cell and I was upset they don't people these things and allow us to decide if we still want to buy the product. Don't  buy this product.
1.0,After a week of wear the finish is already coming off. Poor quality for the cost.
1.0,"Product does not help with glare, all it does is turn everything yellow plus glare"
1.0,"Cheap quality, see through."
1.0,This product is not a good quality.  Buyer be ware.
1.0,This was so cute and exactly the colors I needed for my purse. I enjoyed how it looked for a whole nine days. Today I looked at my purse the pompons had fallen off and all I had left was the gold key ring with hook that's probably worth a quarter. So I don't recommend this at all! Zero stars if that was an option.
1.0,I really wanted to like this. But the sizing is way small and so it won‚Äôt work for me. I guess if you‚Äôre on the smaller end and size up you may be ok...
1.0,I ordered a xxxl i normally wear an xl... its way to small its barely too big for my 10 year old daughter who wears a childrens petite 8 girls
1.0,"The portion of the dress from the waist down fit perfectly, however the white was see-through. The top half was extremely large, it would have been better in a smaller size for the top half."
1.0,"First, the cups I received are not 18 oz as advertised.  They are 16 oz.  I have another brand of 16oz and wanted larger or I would have order the same as my last order.<br /><br />Second, the rim is course and not pleasurable to sip out of.<br /><br />Disappointed."
1.0,I groom dogs and was so excited to wear this cute apron to work daily.. sadly the pocket ripped the 2nd day after wearing it.
1.0,Though I received this product in a timely manner it was dicolored and looked almost tarnished. The quality of sterling silver seemed cheap too.
1.0,Super thin material and there was a seam down the front that was definitely a sewing error.  It was way too long in the front - regardless of how tight I tied the knot.  Very disappointing.
1.0,Everyone made fun of me.
1.0,"I should start by saying that this item kept saying it was running late in being delivered but I already had it. What a pain to return it and get my money back. That said, it was quite a heavy piece and it kept digging into my head. Awful"
1.0,I wanted to love this top. It‚Äôs has a beautiful shape and color . BUT the sewing is awful . Lots of loose threads along the crochet part and the neck was sewn crooked. Returned it.
1.0,Need instruction manual as to how they think this will stay on my ear.  It does not fit!
1.0,"Received a belt with rotten buckle, cheap made material, send it back the same day."
1.0,I wish I would‚Äôve read the reviews before purchasing. It is see through before wet! And does not fit as expected. It is very cheap!!
1.0,I was able to wear this ONCE and the band that holds the dress to its shape above the stomach broke before it was even washed. Cheaply made product. Very disappointed.
1.0,"It was a bit tight,but had to use for thr wedding the next day. Would have sent it back if i didnt wear"
1.0,I bought this item for my work ID. I was hoping because the pull had metal instead of string that it would not break but it did and faster than the string.
1.0,pedi con la imagen de MICKEY y sale como si hubiera escogido una de MINNIE
1.0,This is the cheapest piece of jewelry I have ever seen.  I could have bought it for a quarter out of the gumball machine.
1.0,"Waist trainer was fine, zipper is very cheap and broke after wearing for 1 week. Also wish the straps were wider"
1.0,I did not expect for the shorts to fit like underwear for my son. They fit like speedo shorts.
1.0,"BAD QUALITY FABRIC DESIGN AND FINISH BAD, THE BODY IS HORRIBLE TO BUY MEDIUM SIZE IS LIKE ONE PERSON OR MORE THAN 100 KILOS. DO NOT RECOMMEND"
1.0,"Bad fit,  When I wanted to return the item this seller will keep half the money and then you have to pay for the  postage.  I just lost $25 and I'm stuck with three bad fitting shirts."
1.0,The heels are slanted and break easily.  My shoe repair man indicated that it is a flawed design.
1.0,Laughable. This is clearly a fake.
1.0,"I was expecting more from this after reading reviews, I get the whole idea of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34; But I really did have a better expectation of this. The fabric is very thin and cheap like. Almost like paper but  a silk version. The lace is coming undone at the corner of one of the edges which is another disappointing factor."
1.0,"This pendant is very huge. I would never wear something of this size. I thought of just keeping it in my purse, but the gems look like plastic to me. And not sure the order of gems is accurate and I don't find anything for crown chakra. The description and the product details lists different set of gems. Not sure about this pendant at all. So returning it."
1.0,Returned it because it was WAY too small.
1.0,"The item I received was super shiny and plastic looking, not the cute matte bag that is pictured... I really want to find the cute matte finish bag. :/"
1.0,Fabric wrinkles terrible need ironing
1.0,Picture is nothing like the product.
1.0,"What a waste! Bought for my wife and it came stained and with areas where the threading is super thin. Hard to explain, but you can see in the pictures. The fabric is very thin and damaged in places. It also bunches weirdly at the waist. Only positive is that is has pockets. I think my Amazon clothes buying days are over."
1.0,Pink ball gag is dirty and looks like it was in someone elses mouth.<br />I will have to disinfect and wash before using.<br />Very large. The strap is huge.<br />The ball gag is hard plastic and is 6 inches around.<br />Not as described.<br />Very large.<br />Hard plastic.<br />Refund/return.
1.0,Took almost three months to arrive and had a weird smell to it that won‚Äôt go away
1.0,I returned it immediately. The strap was too difficult to open. I broke a nail.
1.0,They arrived with a torn back pocket
1.0,"Poor quality, the pockets already had stitching coming undone. I'm returning."
1.0,"This umbrella looked cute and I liked that it had more ribs than other umbrellas. And that‚Äôs it for the PROS.<br /><br />I took this on vacation to Iceland because it didn‚Äôt take up much space. It was pouring when we arrived to pick up our rental car and I pulled out this umbrella and opened it up and the part that holds the umbrella open, clicked and fell off. I don‚Äôt know if this is a one off or not, but I spent the rest of my vacation getting wet."
1.0,I bought this is XXL size and it runs very very small. Tried this garment on and seems to be a med-large size.
1.0,"Beware. This is not authentic. This is heat press transfer paper on a hoodie. When the one I ordered came, the yugioh symbol was upside down."
1.0,Very poor quality!  Returning!
1.0,While the mask looks great ypu cannot see through it. It's made with really dark sunglasses and we can't trick or treat because you can't see a thing.
1.0,"The smell is unbearable. I can‚Äôt try it on because I can‚Äôt stand to get close to it. Surely, this chemical shouldn‚Äôt be inhaled by humans."
1.0,"I only started purchasing socks online. I ordered brand name socks online from Macy's that are great. These are not great. I won't be ordering unbranded clothing like this again. Note, I did also purchase Under Armour socks online and I am disappointed with them as well. So even branded clothing can be low quality."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt like not as picture
1.0,"This would be a great case except it does not fully close. Kind of hard to sell a protective case when the case doesn't close enough to protect the phone. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND, AT ALL."
1.0,The band broke on me the first time I attempted to wear it!!!
1.0,"Poor quality,<br />Poor fit, loose strings, very thin, overall just &#34;ehh&#34; every time disappointed by this brand"
1.0,"This jacket fits small, so order a couple sizes larger than you would normally wear. Slim fit, nice color, nice lining; however, it is very cheaply made! Straight out of the package it was covered in frayed edges and uncut strings. That should have been a warning sign to return. I spent the time to trim the strings because I liked it, but on the second wear the buttons started coming off and coming apart. The attached picture shows one of the missing buttons and some newly frayed seams. I barely wore it twice and that's all the use I could get out of it. Wish I could return it. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,It was way to freaking small for him to wear. And I even ordered a bigger size. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this.
1.0,This was delivered filthy! Not just in one area but all over! Plus there is a large tear on the inside! Obviously this was used!
1.0,I didn't like because the picture don't show the earrings as being two separate pieces and the don't stay together.
1.0,The first time I opened it the ‚Äúscrew‚Äù keeping it together broke off and I am unable to get it back on. Looked cute too but now I can‚Äôt use it.
1.0,Ordered a small and am swimming in it. The dress looks super cute in the pics but is WAY too big and looks like a sack of potatoes when I put it in. The tie at waist does not help. Have to return it.
1.0,Cheap material and the color neon isn‚Äôt neon it‚Äôs olive color so disappointed on wasting my time and money .
1.0,Still feel cold
1.0,This watch does not keep time. I bought replacement batteries and it still didn't work...
1.0,Cheesy made. But a fun joke. Made for one time wear.
1.0,Run big. Not well made
1.0,"It‚Äôs a shirt. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, and it barely covers  my bottom. There is no way I can wear it as a dress.  I do like the soft material, although it‚Äôs very wrinkled- not like the photos. I might keep it to wear with leggings."
1.0,These seem to made for children.  A regular size adult male will likely not be able to keep this fitted as shown in the pictures.  It's even too small for my 5' tall wife.
1.0,"I ordered size 9.5-10. Based on the measurements in the description, it should be slightly smaller than size 10. It arrived in a package labeled size 10, and they are actually slightly larger than size 10. I truly needed size 9.5. It's too bad I live so far from town, because it's not worth the gas to return, so this is an annoying waste of over $6"
1.0,Smelled bad and had the most odd fit. Definitely not oversized.
1.0,The watch will not stay fastened.
1.0,Very cute but fell apart quickly
1.0,Shipping was extremely long. Product does not match description.
1.0,Product looks super cheap
1.0,Horrible swimsuit cover if you want to get it wet or wear it while it's hot out. Sweater like material. Very heavy and stretched  out if wet. Extremely hot if wearing on a hot day. Would not recommend this.
1.0,So disappointing that I haven't had this bag two months and its ripped already. Do not buy this bag!!!
1.0,"I picked out the leopard/coral color combo, and received pink/hearts pants"
1.0,"NOT REAL SILK , SOME CHEAP POLYESTER RAYON MIXTURE, TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !!"
1.0,"Very pretty,  but they showed in an envelope and needless to say the posts were bent to hell!!  Hoping bending back the post doesn't weaken them ."
1.0,It looked too cheap. It was too big in size.
1.0,Way smaller even though sizing up. Did not cover much in the front or back.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:102b074e0036c631de62aea39e8a393c]] Don‚Äôt waste time or money. These are going straight back. All 20 are Completely covered in glue and chipped.
1.0,"It fits weird overall. Too small in some areas, too big in others."
1.0,"I ordered XXL, but looks as Medium"
1.0,Broke one week after purchase.  Looks real nice but it will not keep the right time for more than 15 minutes.  Save your money
1.0,the material used with this size make the hat overly heavy. Also can not see well with the wide front.
1.0,These are HORRIBLY flimsy and paper thin. Too stretchy and just all around horrible.
1.0,"This top appears to be finished at the hems on the sleeves from the pics on this site.  However, when I received it the stitching on the sleeves is obvious and not hemmed under.  Likewise with the front of the top.  There is stitching on both sides going down the v-neck and continuing down the front.  As a result, the top looks cheesy.  I am very disappointed with it.  I don't know how it can be getting 4 stars.  I will say that the colors are nice and bright."
1.0,Poor quality and material.
1.0,Edit 2019: Got a bad rash after wearing my watch with the new band. I'm usually not allergic or sensitive to things but somehow this band gave me a rash. Tried wearing it a second time in case it was something else but still got a bad rash from the band.<br /><br />This fits garmin vivosmart hr 4je. I was nervous to get it since people said it doesn't fit the 4je. You have to remove the plastic piece on the side without the button. Fits perfect. I had to trim the band a little bit where the screen is just so it looks nicer. I do notice the orginal garmin band hugs the screen better so it looks flush. But this works especially for the price and the color I wanted. It shipped and arrived fast too.
1.0,The sizing is not even close to what is listed.  The shirt has pads which I missed in the description also.  This would be ok if they were anywhere close to where my chest actually is.  A total return.
1.0,"This has not worked out well for me. The chain loop breaks easily and the housing does not screw together, just covers the magnets. I cannot recommend this product."
1.0,While the watch looks good the minute hand is barely visible (In the picture it is pointing between 5 & 10) and the second hand is very visable. Terrible design.
1.0,Instead of this top I received a random white cropped hoodie in another size from another brand. The bummer part is that when I went to return that random item and order this one again it was completely sold out. Fail.
1.0,"If i could select a negative amount of stars, i would! Do not buy this cheap ish. It looks awful. The picture is false advertising. Please buy from real Africans. They take pride in their work. This dress is some spandex-old school biker shorts material foolishness! I donated this mess to goodwill..."
1.0,It sides not fit at all way to small for adults size it more like kids size
1.0,"Looks cool but it brakes, and wear off, really easily. It's just not a good buy altogether. I broke the first day i wore it."
1.0,There is no way this will stay put while I sleep.  My grandkids now use it as a Super Hero Belt.
1.0,"Large, not great material, and came with no tags so I couldn't return it. Lame!"
1.0,"Pretty but not full, more of a head scarf."
1.0,I was so excited to get these in. I put it on and it almost immediately peeled right back off. They don't work. Don't waste your money.
1.0,They came already rusty and discolored. I threw them away so fast I didn‚Äôt even get a pic.
1.0,"The material is just weird. It‚Äôs clingy, thin, feels like a sports jersey but much thinner. These also don‚Äôt fit as pictured, I ordered a size up to be safe and they still weren‚Äôt loose like running shorts. They were more fitted and very short."
1.0,i brought these for my nipples the basll didnt even unscrew i was pissed
1.0,"It's the tackiest, most unstable piece of jewelry I have ever encountered!! I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift!!"
1.0,All of the red stone/plastic pieces were broken off...not a problem just glued them back...but the necklace broke just sitting at my desk fell right into my lap. The clasp was unrepairable.
1.0,Changed into a weird pinkish brown color. Does not seem to be sterling silver.
1.0,The hardware to attach on one end of it was faulty and would not clamp onto my watch. The other end fit but now cannot be removed - will not release.
1.0,"The clips are peach, not gold as the ad makes it seem."
1.0,Material doesnt give bought 2 sizes bigger still to small. I will end up using material for something else very cute pattern
1.0,They were so thin the fabric was see thru. Will be returning these as they are useless.
1.0,First day wearing them tore a hole in the knee. Next time the entire crotch ripped out. During a basketball game.
1.0,Waaay too small. I normally wear a medium or large in shirts. Bought the large. Barely could get it over my head. Returned it.
1.0,literally would fit my toddler
1.0,Material. Construction. Look. Fit. Bad all around.
1.0,I loved this bag. I liked the compartments and how I could organize it. Then I used it for only three days... And the shoulder strap snapped. I'd give a higher treating but the bag is not even functional without the strap anymore.
1.0,I did expect this to be a little thicker fall type fabric but it is very thin t shirt material. Not what I thought I was getting.
1.0,Not at ALL what was advertised. Super sticky to the point that I could not get it off. My skin was red and irritated for two days. The video of how it goes on and can be adjusted is not true. My most disappointing Amazon purchase.
1.0,"The fabric was advertised as thick enough to wear without worrying about panty lines. This is not the case. The fabric is thicker, but still too sheer."
1.0,The WORST SLEEPERS EVER!!!!!<br />IT FELL APART IN A WEEK.<br />POOR QUALITY! JUNK!<br />DO NOT BUY THIS SLEEPERS
1.0,Material is very stiff no stretch even after you wash it and it was itchy
1.0,Too small too thin
1.0,Very cheaply made would not buy
1.0,It was more like a women‚Äôs small and definitely not as mans ex.
1.0,Poor quality doesn‚Äôt look as nice as the picture.  This dress is very cheaply made and it doesn‚Äôt look as nice as the picture. The quality is very poor and I would not wear it outside of my home. I returned it for a refund.
1.0,These were too small and the material was itchy.
1.0,Need to arrange return
1.0,Didn‚Äôt look like the picture. Had bell sleeves instead and was very poor quality.
1.0,"The pink is completely see through, you can even see the pockets through the dress"
1.0,Thin fabric. Not much more than a pocket a scarf. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again. Don‚Äôt waste your money on these.
1.0,The computer blue ray blocking or whatever that‚Äôs called is too dark - I can‚Äôt get a clear view to read a book or tweeze my eyebrows
1.0,"Let me start off by saying the color is WAY off. It‚Äôs not a burgundy or maroon like in the photo, it‚Äôs more of a straight up RED. Like star spangled banner red. Material is thick and uncomfortable and looks extremely cheap and unflattering"
1.0,I got a patch instead of the metal ranks like it was listed. That will teach me to read the reviews before buying anything again.
1.0,Fits narrow
1.0,I am five foot two and I ordered a medium and it fits fine I ordered the yellow one it is see through you have to either wear a slip or because the lining on the inside is so thin I needed this dress for a wedding and I have to go buy a slip or have a seamstress sew a thicker lining into it I would not suggest buying the yellow
1.0,"I was really looking forward to getting this hat. However when it arrived it had been rolled and folded to fit into tiny bag. It was misshaped and brim was so creased it could never be reshaped, so hat was all lopsided and unwearable.<br />Certainly not the pretty picture they advertise with. I returned it. Probably will never order a hat again fearing same result."
1.0,This item did not work for me and I had to return it.  Was a good looking watch but needs to work.
1.0,Worn out looking very quickly.  would not buy again
1.0,Such junk
1.0,This looks super cute in the photo BUT beware coz it is nothing like in here. It is extremely cheap material and runs really small. The top reminds me of a thicker stockings but the cheaper kind so it needs extra care when you pull it out of the bag. The ribbon that comes with it is already Broken and wrinkled like crazy (same with the skirt part of this lingerie) if I can give this 0 stars I will!
1.0,"Great style, hard to see out of. Terrible reflection."
1.0,I bought this set for my daughter who lost all her jewelry in a fire. I will not give this to her because it's cheap painted metal not the 925 it was advertised as.  The only bit of silver was on the tab stamped 925. The rest stuck to my magnet and was thrown in the trash
1.0,"The jewelry ended up discoloring... Since I can‚Äôt really see too close in my ear, my husband noticed... and it literally happened the day after the return window closed. Figures... super cute but since it‚Äôs a new diath piercing I had to take it out"
1.0,Did not like it once it arrived...it looked CHEAP!
1.0,The dress is four inches too long and four inches too tight in the chest. This maker needs to study the American market and Amazon needs to give guidelines for quality to its sellers.
1.0,"Cargo shorts, by definition, should be roomy.  These are snug."
1.0,they put the dress on backwards on the manikin...
1.0,When I removed the shades from the package one of the lens fell out of the frames. Wheh I tried to put it back in the other lens fell out. Neither lens would stay in the frames. I returned the shades.
1.0,"Material and style as expected and what is shown in the pics. However, the size of the shirt was too small. Ordered the XXL and felt more like a Large. Returned it for that reason."
1.0,Didn't come with a gold bow and lost its silver color
1.0,"In the morning when I put these on I was pleasantly surprised by the fit and comfort of these socks. When I took them off at the end of the day, there was a hole in one sock near the toe.<br /><br />After one days use."
1.0,"Do not buy this, it is junk. The strap in between your breasts is made for a straw. I ordered a 36, and I‚Äôm a size 6 in life. All the straps are too short and they‚Äôre so cheap you feel of you stretch them they‚Äôll snap."
1.0,Other better products on Amazon for about the same price.
1.0,"Very confusing, I'm not sure what hole fits these earrings. The holes in my ears are of standard size, these earrings are to thick to fit in my ears. LOL, I will use them for cufflinks, yeah that's it cufflinks."
1.0,"Product is made of polyester, not cotton, nor flannel."
1.0,Battery falls very fast
1.0,Get what you pay for.  Cheap product.  Lens is foggy.  More of a toy than an actual pair of sunglasses.  If you want a party favor this is the product.  If you want something to function as a pair of sun glasses stay away from this product.
1.0,the key chain arrived broken. The elephant was split into 2 pieces. The quality is poor.
1.0,Bought a size up because of the reviews and I was very disappointed because it is extremely tight and now I need to go through the hassle of returning it:-(.
1.0,Barely fit my 6 year old
1.0,"Too long and looks odd on my babies head, regret buying as I wanted something more fitted. Good quality hat though."
1.0,They were way too small for an extra large. When I did not get a reimbursed for all 3 I took back I think I only got reimbursed for one.
1.0,"I bought these for a more than 12 hour flight to Auckland, NZ thinking it would help with the circulation while sitting for so long. I don't think it worked. These socks are EXTREMELY tight. When I could finally take them off, the burning pain lasted for over an hour and when I finally had the courage to see what the damage was, this is what I saw (keep in mind this is an hour after removing the socks). The pattern from the argyle stitching is still imbedded into my skin and I have fever blisters all over my legs and it still hurts if anything touches the skin. I'm in a strange country and I have to deal with this now. I will strongly recommend not purchasing these socks. They will cause more harm than they will help."
1.0,The fabric is very thin and see through.  I honestly can't imagine someone wearing this blouse in an office setting.
1.0,Thin and poor material.  Waste of money. Made in China. Reviews indicate that quality deceased over the years I think.
1.0,"I know what I was ordering when I bought it because I ran out of the one I had and absolutely love it for my  Heritage RedWing boots, but upon opening it I realized this one had already been opened and used. Love the product but not happy to receive a used product when it was listed as new."
1.0,Looked & felt like plastic
1.0,Had high hopes since it has so many reviews and is highly promoted. I have been sized by more than 1 bra specialist as a 38G. I ordered the 1 Luxe as suggested by the size chart. I had major side boob spillage. Indicating it is too small. You would think a smaller incorrect size would atleast mean a tighter fit. Nope. I have boob spillage and still way too much movement/bounce during cardio & HIIT. Wish I could return/exchange.
1.0,Absolutely no shine. Very disappointed.
1.0,Wouldn‚Äôt even turn on. Pissed.
1.0,did not like.
1.0,Great looking but that's about it.<br />It's tight and as you can see in the pic you can barely see the image.<br />As you can see the ends roll up.<br />Very long.
1.0,"Poor product . Not cotton, bleached."
1.0,Do not order! These are way ton small for your nose.
1.0,"I ordered the one with ruffle all the way down the side, not the wrap style. Very disappointed in the fabric. It is similar70's shiny fabric that looks like cheap polyester. I've like other Grace Karin dresses. Bummed on this one."
1.0,broke first time worn.
1.0,Order your size. The chart told me I needed to go up a size n the crap was to big
1.0,"I have 5-6 pairs of sunglasses and I want to organize them. Well, this doesn't worth the price at all. First, this case smells, really really smells.<br />second, the quality inside is not very good. I can feel the cardboard under the velvet and the interlayer is not sturdy.<br />Third, the most important part, none of my sunglasses can fit the size. It cannot be completely closed after I put my sun glasses into it. And even my toy frames (without lens) cannot fit. It is only suitable for the normal glasses! Not sunglassesB Not satisfied at all.I shouldn't be in such a hurry"
1.0,The color of this shirt looks like you washed in with a bunch of red items and the color soaked in the shirt. It looks like a pale pink in the picture but no. I won‚Äôt even wear this out. It actually looks bad.
1.0,it was too small.
1.0,"when it arrived I noticed it was in a felt bag, no padding, when I opened the package I noticed 1 loose, that's when I saw it was broken and bent... very sad."
1.0,This material is so thin and see-through. This Gator offers zero protection against anything.
1.0,It unraveled after two days
1.0,"I carefully chose a pair of pettipants that would not be polyester, only the rayon this item is billed as.  Lies!  It is polyester, and hideous.  Plus being not proportioned well for Western bodies.  To return means shipping back to China, already more than the item is worth.  I will never buy anything on Amazon that ships from Asia again - too many horrible wastes of time, money, and disappointment."
1.0,"disappointed, very small looked just like photo though"
1.0,"Product does not properly fit snug, they kept falling down. I ordered a large because I like to be comfortable, but leggings kept falling off my butt! So, not cool!"
1.0,It looks and feels super cheap. You get what you pay for I suppose.
1.0,It was right product but wrong size. Do not go based on description because it is misleading
1.0,The fit was just completely weird... anyone giving this a good review must have tiny tiny hands as the pockets were tiny like they were really just for show and not for actual use. it was both tight in some places and loose in others just weird!<br />I hate it.
1.0,My son put these on his shoes yesterday and today they are already coming apart.  So disappointing.
1.0,Way too small for a large!
1.0,Smelled like rotton formaldehyde on the inside ü§¢
1.0,Don't buy it. It is a piece of junk.
1.0,"The top does not look like an a half band tee. The color is not a washed or faded black. It‚Äôs a solid black and thick material. The print does not look faded or worn. It‚Äôs very vibrant and colorful. When you are purchasing band tee‚Äôs you typically get the grunge, washed worn look. This isn‚Äôt it. This resembles a district full cotton tee made at home with a cricut heat press."
1.0,The shirt was way to small & the material was very thin.
1.0,Terrible product. There was very little ahedisive around the edges. It would not hold it against the screen so your touch didn't work without pushing really hard. You can not use with outside case it would push the screen off. I wasted my money. I would have given it no stars but it wouldn't let me.
1.0,Obviously these are not pink like shown in the picture. Daughter very Disappointed!! Look more like men‚Äôs glasses
1.0,"April 2019.  I had ordered these about a month ago and now I wish I would have waited.  We just got out disney magic bands and these do not fit the bands for our kids.  I believe WDW recently switched from one band type to another so maybe that‚Äôs the issue.  To be fair when I say they don‚Äôt fit, technically they do but only once I tried to stretch it out and then also I literally have to try to pry the thing into place once the magic band is on my kid and twice my kid said ‚Äòouch‚Äô.  I had also ordered adult sized ones for my husband and I.  They actually fit better than the child‚Äôs size one.  Slightly loose but I think my kid would have to intentionally move it to get it into a position where it wouldn‚Äôt work.  So I am now pitching the kids size ones and luckily we still have time to reorder additional adult size ones for our kids bands."
1.0,Do not like the way the scarf sheds.
1.0,ITEM RUNS SMALL ....BEST FITTED FOR A TEEN. THE ELASTIC SNAPPED WHEN I TRIED TO PUT IT ON. BRACELET BROKE AND BEADS FLEW EVERYWHERE. VERY CHEAPLY MADE.
1.0,Product itself seems ok but I got a single bra when it said a 3 pack.
1.0,Horrible and very cheap
1.0,"I liked the color and the look, however I didn't have the purse two weeks before the strap broke. Then the zipper started running off the track. The worst purse I've ever purchased."
1.0,Tried these for bridesmaid dresses. The material was cheap and it stuck out on the hips making you look way bigger than you are. Horrible customer service if you can‚Äôt get it as a prime item.. If you can‚Äôt get it on prime you‚Äôll be stuck with an $80 dress you‚Äôll never wear.
1.0,"This looks nothing like the picture provided by seller. There is no bling, it is bling like cloth. There were no reviews at my time of purchase otherwise I would have never purchased.  The seller also changed the description from the time I ordered to now."
1.0,"I ordered the pink Easter one but it is only held together by a single string in chest area, waist area is uncomfortably small on my kid no stretch at all , shes 2 years old & wears 3-4T even if I sized up The pants area or something would‚Äôve been big in other places. This is an outfit that probably only works on petite kids not a chucky babies like mine."
1.0,Sloppy paint job and the helmet broke in half with one drop.
1.0,Purchased because i have years old sets of these and the new ones already have strings breaking and the toes have bunches of stitched seem material making some of them unwearable
1.0,I ordered these in Every size. Cute style.NONE FIT! Asians have no curves. Don't order if you look like a woman.
1.0,"I bought this sweater too meet my sister at the airport, with my other sisters in attendance. I wore this sweat 1 time, it worked beautifully, but when I put it on again, only one light lit up. I am an older lady and I'm very easy on clothes, I had this sweater on for literally 2 hours, and when I put it on for an actual Christmas gathering none of the lights except one lit up. Very very disappointed. So DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,Cheaply made damn things fell apart less than a year
1.0,"These pants had a nice fit, but the stripe and logo are PINK!  Men's basketball pants with fuchsia details.  It looked red online, but when it came it is pink.  I bought these for my son, however when I saw they were pink I tried them on.  They were nice pants, but the color is awful.  No problem with the return as usual."
1.0,I was so excited to received this dress. The first time i wore it the back seam fabric shredded. It was discovered by a parent at my school as I was walking off campus.
1.0,no where close to 4xl  more like xl.
1.0,cheap broke easily
1.0,Nunca me llego el art√≠culo
1.0,"Bought two pair, one as a gift and one for me and BOTH broke within a week"
1.0,"I don‚Äôt know if my pair is defective or what but I feel like I‚Äôm standing on my hardware floors barefooted I just don‚Äôt feel the coolness of the floor. These aren‚Äôt even that cozy feeling bedroom shoes that keep your feet warm, your feet will slide out of them very easily. I‚Äôm returning these ASAP!!"
1.0,"The bracelet is pretty but the problem is that it's sized to fit a 4 year old child.  Unless you have teeny, tiny wrists this bracelet won't fit you.  I even attempted to try the bracelet on my 13 year old daughter and it wouldn't go around her wrist either.  I'm not happy and I think you should have had the diameter listed in your product description."
1.0,"Very low quality runs much smaller than normal, extremely short"
1.0,It is very tiny I usually fit an extra large this would maybe fit a four year olds waist
1.0,"Terrible, would never ever buy from them again. Bad construction and the material was hard and had no flexibility."
1.0,Watch arrived with the tiny latch already broken. There is no way that this watch latch would be strong enough.
1.0,Pretty but too tight on legs. Would not buy again. They are not one size. And I'm not even big.
1.0,Ordered this and lights were scattered all over the box on top of my other items - turned out that I was missing 4 packages of 4 lights.
1.0,The straps are not adjustable. It would seem that one size fits all adult munchkins.<br />None of the markings on the hat that I saw were in english.
1.0,Basically pantyhose for your arms.
1.0,I'm 5'6'' - 130 pound - got a medium although I'm a small - medium was still too small. Gonna return and get a XL
1.0,"Product arrived on time, however material was cheap and Emotional was spelled wrong it said ‚Äúemoticnal‚Äù"
1.0,Rip in the back of the dress after one wash. Only wore it once. Washed on a delicate cycle too. The pictured dress also had pockets and the dress I received did not.
1.0,Not at all like photos. It was tight in the wrong places and saggy in the wrong places. I do not recommend.
1.0,"These are hands down the worst leggings I‚Äôve ever ordered off Amazon. They are tight in the stomach, so loose they hang off my legs, have a tight band around the waist that bunches and rolls."
1.0,Was for myself
1.0,"The striped and the checked material seem to be different materials so the whites do not match...Not what I expected, will be returning. I wanted it for a winter sweater, not a summer."
1.0,The clasp was broken on the necklace as was one of the earrings.  I don't understand how it can be mailed out this way.
1.0,You slip at every step. The little rubber band is not strong enough.
1.0,Some don't work. Obviously cheap. Weak üß≤.
1.0,Very poorly made. Both ear loops broken. Fabric is very thin. Not going to help protect from COVID19.
1.0,It didn't say anywhere in the description that it was completely sheer. I really loved the pattern but my back is tattooed and I can't wear sheer tops to work. I had to return it.
1.0,"I never write reviews but this was by far the worst item I‚Äôve ever received off Amazon! Does not look at all like the picture, belongs in the dollar store, paint chipped off when it arrived, maybe is about 10 I‚Äôm in total length do not buy complete waste of money! Would like to give negative stars but wasn‚Äôt an option"
1.0,One of the stones fell out within a day!!! Didn't even last a whole day of wear.
1.0,"Junk. It is base metal, not stainless steel. It turned my skin green the first time I wore it. Not happy at all."
1.0,My son wore these for a few weeks and a hole already wore through the bottom
1.0,"These shrink like crazy the first time you wash them. The original size was perfect, now that they have shrunk they no longer lay flat and are constantly popping into baby's face."
1.0,"Very cheap materials.  Backpack came with stitching already undone and the zippers broke within the first 2 weeks of use.  Had to throw it away.  Still have the lunch bag but it is already tearing up.  When you buy it, know it isn't going to last long."
1.0,"The masks are good, the straps do not hold up well, very poor material"
1.0,"It's awful. Like a thin fleece blanket, seams aren't finished looks as if it was originally a long sleeve item that they cut the sleeves out of. Strings everywhere. Contacted customer service they offered I keep and use this item,  which was intended for a gift although I'd be embarrassed to give, and they refund 30% I then messaged that the item was unusable and they messaged me back to say they aren't in office and can't help me. Poor product and poor customer service in my opinion."
1.0,2 pairs I ordered have ripped at the seem after one month. Bummer
1.0,"I have seen soooo many beautiful bracelets, most are wearing multiple at time and they are gorgeous. The ones they picked for me were very ugly, colors very ugly and none matched so can't wear any of them together. I was very disappointed but I can say the shipping was very fast !"
1.0,I see why they were so cheap. I bought size 7 to fit snug under his clothes without bunching.  The pants didnt even cover his butt. They fit more like a size 5. The shirt was fine. Going to see if i can return
1.0,Very cheaply made. I guess if you just want a ‚Äúwatch‚Äù to tell time that looks decent that‚Äôs the one for you. But if you actually enjoy watches this won‚Äôt do it. Very light. Bracelet very flimsy and noisy. Feel very cheap made all around. Almost afraid to touch it. Returned it.
1.0,These briefs are made in such an awkward fit....and took a long time to arrive.
1.0,The ends of the straps don‚Äôt allow the temples to enter.
1.0,The product shows in picture is not as in original.
1.0,"Gave me an instant rash and turned my skin green. I GAVE AS A GIFT, TOTALLY EMBARRASING!!!"
1.0,Upon opening the box a stone had already fallen out! Complete bummer!  I thought spending alittle more money would mean they'd last a lottt longer than this! :(
1.0,The top is very cute but for me runs very big.  I ordered a Large and it's huge.  The shirt is poorly made.  The sewing is crooked at the bottom and they left several strings hanging over the shirt.
1.0,Beware of sizing before ordering. I wear a size 16/18 and I thought I was more than safe ordering a XXL. NOPE! I understand that they are high compression so they are going to be tighter but I could barely get them up my legs. I think there is something seriously wrong with their sizing.
1.0,too thick and not as described
1.0,I purchased the glasses for a classroom activity. The glasses started falling apart because the screws fell out. My students were deeply disappointed that they could not wear the glasses. I had the students throw out the glasses due to safety concerns. I would not recommend these glasses for use with young students.
1.0,This fabric is rough. Not silky.
1.0,Liked  the look üëÄ not true to size.
1.0,"I'm returning the gloves.  They look nice and are soft, but they smell like gasoline !  My hands even smelled like gasoline after trying them on. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,"I was excited to get these pants, even sent them to the cleaners for a crisp crease. They fit in the legs butt were extremely big in the waist. The belt is use less it's for decoration, didn't stay in place or hold the pants up with only 2 loops..The worst part is when I stood up to walk into a room of people to find the zipper busted open. Thank God for spanks and safety pens."
1.0,These were a birthday gift for my boyfriend. He put them on after opening them so we could go hiking and the zipper broke off literally the first time he tried to zip it.
1.0,Not good for beginners.... the tunnels are impossible for me to put them in. Even went up a size to put them in and still no luck
1.0,This charm was beautiful pictured. Very disappointing when finally received after first package they lost. The names are almost invisible. The chain wasnt even 925 it was like a chain from a gumball machine. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,One star!
1.0,Item was delivered with dead batteries.
1.0,"If you are a size medium, order a size large.  Shirt is very small"
1.0,"You must be kidding me!!!<br />I wonder who can use it?!<br />Terrible quality!<br />I wished I didn't trash them, so I would take a picture of them! The eyes were crooked as hell! Even my nieces at the age of 1 can assemble it better!<br />It was so disrespectful!<br />I don't who the people are here giving 5 stars!<br />If I was a manager in Amazon, I would never allow this seller to work with Amazon!"
1.0,Cheap garbage lasted one day on vacation
1.0,I am larger chested & this was much too small. The arm pits were very long on it too which was wierd. Lastly the dress was super long. Maybe if you were a tall skinny 6 foot girl this would work well for you.
1.0,No chain. No clasp. Pre-selected stones (what's the point of showcasing birthstones in it then?).
1.0,"Runs really, really big. Ordered the small and I am swimming in it. To be fair I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù and petite but still, this dress runs very large."
1.0,To short and it kinda dip and dap
1.0,the fabric is not good quality
1.0,Not at all what was advertised!  Too small in every way. I made sure I ordered the correct size according to the company‚Äôs size chart. The seems were bunched and crooked. It‚Äôs just not good quality.
1.0,"Love Pattyboutik...adorable sweater...true to size and very cute on...but came damaged. Not 1...not 2...but 3 holes in the sleeve. There could be more, but I didn‚Äôt want to look any further. I planned on wearing this tomorrow for a work holiday party which I purchased it specifically for. Now instead I‚Äôll be returning it tomorrow. This is the second time this has happened to me with a Pattyboutik item and that is probably what hinders me from purchasing all of their clothes. Very unfortunate and extremely disappointing. Even though I‚Äôve received a damaged item from them before, this will be the first time I‚Äôm leaving a bad review. It‚Äôs sucks when your day was already pretty bad and the most exciting thing you had to look forward to was to try on your new Pattyboutik sweater and it turns out it‚Äôs unwearable. Insult to injury."
1.0,"Well made belt, however, the attachment system is the weakest point.  Simple nylon strap that goes into the belt buckle.  I see this as the single point of failure.  The website does a very poor job of explaining this.  Left over webbing just hangs there, no Velcro to secure the strap.  This is going back."
1.0,"This piece was advertised as a bathrobe, but because it‚Äôs polyester, it is not at all absorbent. It‚Äôs more of a pajama robe. Very disappointed; kinda gross feeling to put it on my kiddo after the bath."
1.0,the quality if really poor and tear apart first time I wear it on a hiking trip. Returned it for refund
1.0,"I can‚Äôt really say this is the worst product I‚Äôve purchased, but it‚Äôs close. These are absolutely horrendous. One will fit, the next won‚Äôt. (No matter how you bend it to fit your ear). Don‚Äôt believe the hype."
1.0,It was a good product but too small  for me and I am a regular size adult male (it was more like a child's size).
1.0,Does not keep your feet warm
1.0,Can't give these sun glasses one star the screws all fell out two days after I purchase each side had hanging love the eye wear sorry they were poorly made and not checked before shipping
1.0,El material no es de muy buena calidad / The material is not of very good quality.
1.0,I was so bummed when I tried this dress on.  It was cute and all was going well until I looked down.  This dress falls mid-way between my knees and ankles!
1.0,The hat was not shaped correctly. Looked very weird on my child.
1.0,"These should of clearly be marked &#34;children's socks&#34;. Very upset about this one. I watched these for awhile before I bought them. I'm a size 8. To top it all off 2 of the 5 pair were snagged. Not even worth it. They are cute for little, little kids. Save your money!"
1.0,"Horrible, doesn‚Äôt fit.<br />It has no hold and the wig itself looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,"So, the little bikini top and bottom aren't terrible - actually pretty cute if a bit skimpy, and the top is lined. I bought this for the rashguard portion, though - and this was so poorly made that the entire zipper and collar were VERY noticeably off center/asymmetrical and made it look awful. Maybe if you got lucky you'd get one that was better made and better centered. In terms of fit, the L fit me ok with a little extra room on the rashguard for me at 5'5&#34; 135 lb (usually wear 6-8)."
1.0,It was super cute. But the ring broke almost perfectly in half.
1.0,"soft and luxurious feel, small enough to be easy to carry but you can pack a lot of stuff in there. i love the style and the feel of the leather. the color is true purple and matches a lot of my wardrobe (purple being my favorite color)<br />i am very happy with this purse<br />I am writing this addition two and a half years later and am very disappointed - the color is totally peeling off from the handbag with very little use. I loved this bag and am hoping that I can contact someone in customer service and send them a photo. little pieces of leather all over the place, with white patches from the loss of - I guess it's paint -"
1.0,"I am a 37 D and ordered a large. This would only fit if I was an A or B. Of course its not prime, so I can't return it for free. Seriously just don't buy it if you're larger than a B cup, regardless of how skinny you are."
1.0,I was disappointed that this dress was way too small.
1.0,I liked what it said on key chain
1.0,"Ewwwe... don't smell up your house with these. Besides the stink, they fall apart to the touch."
1.0,"This shirt runs really small. I wear a large, and wanted it to fit very loose so I ordered a 2X. It fits fairly snug, not what I expected at all. I gave it to my daughter who wears a medium, and it fits her pretty well."
1.0,This was poorly made! Fabric is cheaply made and it looks like my granddaughter could have made it.
1.0,I‚Äôm returning it. It has too much polyester
1.0,Demasiado el√°stico
1.0,Clasp will not stay closed therefore useless to wear and risk losing it.
1.0,"Looks like horrible panty hose. They fit fine but are thinner than most tights. These are NOT LEGGINGS. they're tights, trust me."
1.0,"Photochromatic THESE ARE NOT.<br />Got them was excited. Have had Photochromatic lenses before, not from Saucer tho. Opened package up. Put them into my Oakley Jawbones, went outside..stood in the sun..and waited...and waited...and waited..and waited. Stood outside nearly blind with clear lenses for 35-40 minutes.....<br />Tried to cold start them. (Put in freezer for 5 mins then out in light to activate Photochromatic properties....Clear lenses)<br />I am not impressed. Would not buy Photochromatic lenses from Saucer again."
1.0,Material was cheap with poor stitching. A definite thumbs down.
1.0,Not a good watch
1.0,Very disappointing as the leather part was worned out and became black after a couple of weeks wearing it only !!!!!
1.0,Was expecting something different.
1.0,Not great logo imprint.<br />Lousy delivery time!!!!
1.0,The plastic on the earring was extremely sharp. I had to use a nail file to dull the post. Wouldn't buy this again. Shipping took a while as it came from another country and I think it is overpriced. Exspecially after the cut I got when I went to put it in.
1.0,The liner in the purse came ripped which isn't shocking since it‚Äôs made by the cheapest material. Do NOT waste your money!
1.0,"Cool hat, unfortunately was shipped wadded up in a bag which ruined its shape beyond ever being wearable."
1.0,Just couldn‚Äôt wear it because it is not true to size in the States!
1.0,This dress has no tapering at the waist. It's completely shapeless. The material has zero stretch and is a little too see-through for comfort. I'm really disappointed. The shape of the dress is absolutely not flattering and looks very cheap.
1.0,Stones are barely visible and the sizing was way off.  Was very very small.  Obviously this was returned.
1.0,I just received my second order. The first one I got the wrong size so I had to order it again and when I received (one day late) when I tried it on I couldn't believe that on my left sleeve is ripped as I shown the picture. I am very disappointed.
1.0,The backs of the earrings do not even fit the earring itself. Junk
1.0,"Though the jewelry is nice, it‚Äôs not practical. They didn‚Äôt have enough lip to stay put in my ears. Too heavy to be like that."
1.0,Bottom of dress fits good but top is not appealing and straps are too loose.
1.0,I ordered these a half size larger than what my daughter wears and her toe was peaking through the hole. The material was flimsy and the hook part is very sharp which could stretch your little one.
1.0,Don't like that it had a slit AND ruffles. They just don't work together on a sheath dress. Gave dress to my friend.
1.0,I have only had this vest for a week and the pocket snap already broke.
1.0,"I did not like the way this top fit me, the peplum part looked strange and it fell at a weird place. I bought my usual size and it was very unflattering."
1.0,Terrible stretch
1.0,"on time ,extremely well packaged.  When it first  came it was so pretty  and I was so happy. Then with normal wear, not even  every day  all of the stones fell out.  I'm so sad because I loved this ring so much, it was my princess ring. Now it's just junk.<br /> ."
1.0,Alot smaller than I thought. I even ordered two sizes up.
1.0,"The wideth is to wide, the name brand of the shoe was sewed on crooked and the fur comes loose easy."
1.0,"They're beautiful, but the listing shows Pluto and it is not in fact on the bracelets and the seller will not correct it."
1.0,"This is one of the most uncomfortable sandal I have ever worn. It might be due to the material of the sandals, they are extremely &#34;stiff&#34;. I thought they would become more &#34;flexible&#34; and comfortable after months of wearing, but that wasn't the case. It was still extremely uncomfortable and I'm so angry after discarding it, I feel the need to write this review. I don't recommend this at all."
1.0,I ordered this key fob because it depicted the 4 buttons which is the key that I have.  I received however the key fob with three buttons.  Unfortunately I have to return it.  If they sold the key fob with the 4 buttons I would purchase it
1.0,"This sweater was too small and when I opened the plastic it was in it had a strong, strange chemical smell. It was not soft at all. I returned it ."
1.0,Ugly baggy what more can I say... don‚Äôt waste your money. Doesn‚Äôt look like pix at all.
1.0,"From the front it looked great, but the back was puffing out in a weird way."
1.0,Horrible just dont fit right. I got a medium.  Cant get it over my thoughts and its wierd when I put it over my head i cant get my arms in .its made wierd
1.0,One my dogs collar for less than 2 weeks and heart sepersted from hook. Too expensive for that poor quality
1.0,most of them are really small ...they don't even fit .wouldn't buy again
1.0,"bag is too big, color is off too, not good.<br />also not amazon prime, returning it cost you money, don't buy it"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4fc038724e9e91946ec57f5cfb6d51d4]] Diameter is slightly to big. This causes the umbrella to Shift/Sway/Shake back and forth.
1.0,terrible fitting
1.0,Nothing like pictures. Looks most like 4th picture. Would not recommend unless you like sandy yellowish jeans.
1.0,"The gloves are soft and works on those touchscreen gadgets.  However, the workmanship of the product does present some problems since I work the gloves for only several days for only a few hours and one starts to tear with big hole between fingers."
1.0,"Product was TERRIBLY package. Practically hard to remove the wrapper from the entire thing. Although each pair of slipper were individually wrapped, these definitely will NOT be comfortable or add any type of value to your hospitality. Slipper itself is practically like cardboard with a piece of paper on top.<br /><br />AVOID! This is a CRAP product, and immediately chucked the entire thing in the garbage. So disappointed in myself for thinking I was getting a bargain, only to be bamboozled."
1.0,I didn‚Äôt but this item but it looks like it‚Äôs a great target to steal even if you‚Äôre broke.
1.0,soles are heavy and are to grippy or carpet
1.0,Hello as much as I like the fit just wear it only once and it reap off instantly and it happen infront of my friends that have already been proud of about it I'm  so dissatisfied and disappointed
1.0,Developed a hole in the armpit right away
1.0,"The magnet isn't strong enough to hold it in place properly.  Therefore, this thing has to be so far up your nose to stay that it looks as fake as it is.  :-/  Maybe I have a weirds nose, idk."
1.0,"Title says polarized, description says non-polarized. Please stop with all these deliberate falsehoods!"
1.0,Not magnetic -_-
1.0,I have ordered small size and I got medium size top and its way too big for me.
1.0,"I bought this product without reading the reviews. I actually just looked at the star rating. Big mistake!!!! Initially, the socks looked really cute. The socks fit my 3 year old son perfectly. I was really happy with the purchase until I washed the socks. They shrank so much, they now fit my 3 month old daughter!!!! Please do not waste your money unless you have a small baby that can wear them after you wash them."
1.0,Too thin not how it was described
1.0,"Tried this on, laughed, & immediately sent it back. The sleeves are too short, the inner arm area is seamed so far out it looks like bat wings, & the rest of it fits like a potato sack. The pattern was different & the material was shiny."
1.0,"Same bag from a different retailer. The rest of the bag is pottery durable and roomy, but the top seam, where the hanger is, ripped right out."
1.0,"I NEEDED this to work for my birthday party tomorrow. I was so excited. I put it on & it completely just flopped down in the front. I tried the strap in the back but because there no structure support, the cups just flopped down exposing my chest. Now i wasted money and have no bra options for the dress"
1.0,The case is NOT leather
1.0,I must have a huge head bc it didn‚Äôt even come close to fitting. It did however fit My 4 year old
1.0,Dress is very ugly.... looks nothing like the pic
1.0,"Fabric is terrible, pantsuit didn't fit properly, and had a few stains on it."
1.0,Came totally smooshed like other reviewers mentioned...
1.0,"Don't buy this Asian stuff, it's never good quality and always sized ridiculously small - especially in chest area...like they've never heard of a C cup...."
1.0,I did not like the feel of the fabric. It almost felt plastic. I sent it back.
1.0,I‚Äôm pretty sure these were made for someone with ears the size of bunny rabbits. They are MASSIVE and absolutely won‚Äôt stay on your ears. Waste of money for sure
1.0,no support at all
1.0,Very cute but order the next size up
1.0,"I ordered these for my daughter who is 99lbs, I got the smallest size and they actually fit me (I am 145lbs). They are also just really ugly, do not look like the picture at all."
1.0,"I purchased 3 pants, one of them is ripped. I did t bother returning since i will have to return all of them when i can easily fix it. But for the price? You would know its a low quality. The reason i purchased it is coz description says its versatile. Its supposed to be all weather, long lasting pants."
1.0,Do not like anything about this shirt..not as expected
1.0,"I bought this dress after it was recommended on various blogs that I follow. However, this dress was a HUGE disappointment. It seemed to run at least one size large. Not to mention, the dress already had a rip around the neckline when it arrived."
1.0,I have a 10 year old. These were super tight and did not work like they were supposed to.
1.0,I bought two of these for my son they both broke in a very short time I would just save your money
1.0,it started to make my finger ache to the bone
1.0,NOT NO SHOW BOAT SHOE OR LOAFER SOCKS!  Just received these today and they are definitely not no show boat shoe or loafer socks as advertised. I've got several pairs of boat shoes and loafers and there's a lot of sock showing on all of them. They'll make for fine casual lace up shoe socks but not for what they were advertised. VERY FRUSTRATING!
1.0,It broke on me out of nowhere on the hook so no it sucks never recommend to any one ever
1.0,Iam absolutely disappointed this runs horribly small
1.0,"Dress does not look like the pictures. The description of the material on the page says it is made of polyester and spandex. The dress I received is 65% cotton and 35% spandex so it is not comfortable. Also, as stated in another review, the band at the top barely fits under the bust area. In my opinion, this product has been very falsely advertised. I will be returning it."
1.0,"I know I clicked on the white clear with blue, but the tortoise showed up. I am reluctant to give any stars as I am dissatisfied and have to pay for return of item I didn't want."
1.0,Size mis leading. Did not fit as expected even when choosing a bigger size
1.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 180 pounds. The rear seem ripped out the first day i was wearing them. I have to send all 4 pairs back. üòê
1.0,cutie idea but the curve on it is very weird and long. you can see it from the front of your face and almost looks like a clip in or something. i‚Äôm gonna bend it to make it smaller but the curve is just weird.
1.0,Not as pictured. For just a gold dolphin. Not with blue inlay.
1.0,Muy mala calidad no lo use lo regrese
1.0,Took almost 3 months to receive.  Broke 2 on the first use.  It is comfortable easy to breath. Very thin foam.  After one use it is trash
1.0,do not buy this it doesn‚Äôt look lime the photos at all the material is see through and super cheap
1.0,Very skimpy and small even for XXL in kids. The XXL is like an XS.
1.0,This shirt is not a hoodie or a sweatshirt. Just a cheap poorly made $5 tshirt.
1.0,I can‚Äôt get the lens to fit the glasses.
1.0,"Google the instruction manual, THEN decide if you want to own it.Good luck with that!"
1.0,Nice coat just the wrong coat
1.0,Pocket for phone is to small for iPhone on small size.
1.0,"Slippers looked great when they first arrived. After wearing them for 15 minutes, the heal portion is flat. The entire inside feels flat after a week of light wear around the house. I'll need new slippers again next week."
1.0,Cheaply made excesories
1.0,The color fell off in the first few days.
1.0,"Bad quality, very thing product. Definitely a disappointment."
1.0,Cute purse but that doesn't matter when it's poor quality junk. The first strap fell off within a couple days and then the main shoulder strap broke within a couple weeks. Don't waste your time or money on this poor quality purse.
1.0,Too small and does not look like the one in the picture!?  Very disappointed!!!
1.0,"I bought and returned this item twice fir the same reason, each time I opened the skirt (it's folded up) the black seeps onto the white leather so it has a bunch of smeared black all over the areas that should be all white. I returned and bought again in the hopes that the first time it was a fluke but when the 2nd one came, it too had smeared black areas. Terrible because I was really looking forward to wearing this and have the perfect shoes for it. I do NOT recommend anyone wasting their money on it. I tried TWICE **insert eye roll**"
1.0,"Turned color after a few weeks, it looked good other wise."
1.0,COLOR NOT AS PICTURED&#62; SORRY _ I RETURNED THIS. thank you .
1.0,"Ordered a blue sweater, it's purple."
1.0,"I bought this dress in three colors. The fit is very clingy, the fabric is thin, and the pattern of the dress isn‚Äôt like the picture. It‚Äôs more like a column dress. It‚Äôs super unflattering. I‚Äôm keeping them and wearing them as pjs because they are very pajama like."
1.0,This item has been open none original packaging plus was used
1.0,Wears like a robe. Looks nothing like the image or as described. IT LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE WEARING A BATH ROBE.
1.0,But the heel was higher than I anticipated and I returned them.
1.0,I just received the bag and it is horrible.  The buckles and all other metals are all rusted (fasteners/snaps too).  It's moist for some reasons with a very strong smell of chemical not even the smell of the leather itself.  It is dirty and filthy.  I am going to return it ASAP!  What a waste of time!
1.0,"Poorly made. Soaked them in alcohol to sanitize them like every pair of earrings ever, and the red color started to dissolve off my Goron's rubies. They're painted red with nail polish! Then, the gold ""plating"" dissolved off too. Now they look plastic and awful.<br />I have sanitized earrings, but very ugly ones. Cheap! What a waste!"
1.0,Fabric is is thin and cheap. Garment runs small. Slow shipping.
1.0,Plastic lock broke after 17 uses:( cannot find a replacement part.
1.0,This isn't even symmetrical. Also took about two months to arrive.
1.0,My issue is I bought this because it's suppose to be leather and it is not.
1.0,"After only three months of regular business use, the stitching on the zipper is coming undone and leaving a big hole in the bag. This review will be updated based on the response to this"
1.0,They are cheap and don't fit anything like the picture
1.0,Looks and feels very cheap. Something you'd pay a few bucks for.
1.0,fits more like a medium than XL. I NEED TO WATCH WHERE MY CLOTHES COME FROM BECAUSE CLOTHES SHIPPED FROM CHINA SEEM TO BE DIFFERENT SIZE EVEN AFTER LOOKING AT THEIR SIZE CHARTS
1.0,Very disappointed in the size
1.0,I liked it but its a little different from the pic. I thought it as really wide leg.. But it is a nice trouser.. Thanks
1.0,"Did my research on umbrellas and decided on this one.  Had the most number of positive reviews, and not that many bad ones.  The bad reviews were mostly of the umbrella not staying open.  I thought I'd get lucky and get one that worked. No so. Bought it early enough in the week so that it would be here by Friday....it came Saturday.  Assembly was very easy, instructions were pretty self explanatory.  It was just what we were looking for.<br /> The umbrella opened just fine; however, it wouldn't stay open.  The clicking sound you are supposed to hear when opening didn't happen, it happened when closing it.  Makes me wonder if it was assembled in the factory backwards.  I emailed the company and they were prompt to reply with suggestions on how to troubleshoot the problem and they offered to make it right if those suggestions didn't work.  They are aware of the problem of them not staying open, but that doesn't help us since we wanted the umbrella for the weekend.  We decided to box it up and ship it back and get a refund.  We didn't want to wait to receive another one.  We went to our local chain home improvement store and bought one that actually worked.  A little more expensive, but well worth it so far.  If it breaks all we have to do is drive across town to return it."
1.0,rusty the second time i wore it..
1.0,Cheaply sewn and thin. Broken shoulder strap on the first day
1.0,most cages dont close properly they were compleatly tarnished in a week and the loop to put your chain thru is tiny i tryed with several chains most didn't work
1.0,I would like to return this product but I can‚Äôt I got this product wore it and before you know it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt on my neck the chain was cheap. And all this happened within hours of me wearing it don‚Äôt waste your time
1.0,"This dress is perfect fits like a glove !!! Very well made , material is very itchy o had to take it off after 2 minute as I couldn‚Äôt stand it on my skin . I cannot imagine goin our and suffer the all time , is a shame because the dress is very well made"
1.0,Print is of bad quality. One gentle cold wash before use and it was faded and didn't look good.
1.0,"Wasn‚Äôt at all like the picture or description. The gold was an ugly green color, I returned."
1.0,Runs small and looks nothing like the picture
1.0,"This was too short, it was a like a shirt, its built for shorter ladies"
1.0,"I spend about eleven dollars on my overalls at Forever21 when they go on sale. I never pay more than that. They usually only have denim during the time of theri sale because everything goes fast and I never go in on time to purchase a black overall/jumper. I decided to pay the twenty one dollar price listed here because of the rave reviews. I do not own a black jumper and I thought it would be nice to wear one in this blasted heat! Baggy overalls are in, after all, and it is more comfortable loose fitted and light weight than my baggy, thick and weighted denim overalls from Forever21. I wish I could give my own rave review on this product, because Allegra K USUALLY doesn't disappoint. But that isn't the case with this jumper. I'll include some photos for references. I JUST ordered this jumper and wore it ONCE! The quality of the clips are so cheap, that It just snapped off. I'm going to email the seller if I could return it. I did nick the center of the jumper with my nail, just by putting it on. Overall. I wouldn't suggest this jumper. The quality of this jumper just doesn't match the asking price of twenty one dollars. I'm also 5'3 and the jumper doesn't sit above the ankles like it does on the picture model. Even when it is rolled up, it is still quite long on me. Definitely returning this item.."
1.0,Dont fit at all. 2nd pair.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:5b3a22be469e607a1dee19b6147b4db4]] They are okay but I expected them to be a little smaller
1.0,This product was made very poorly. The edges are already coming undone and I haven't even worn it yet. Do not purchase shirt!
1.0,We bought these less and less than a month they were  frayed. Very disappointed.
1.0,Not the product shown in picture!!!
1.0,The neckline was slightly different than shown - wasn't a sharp &#34;V&#34; and therefore looks like a female shirt when worn.  No Bueno.
1.0,"This bed jacket seems fine, except for the very rough an scratchy fabric.<br />I would not recommend this."
1.0,"Although the bracelet arrived on time and was very pretty, it fell apart the second day I wore it."
1.0,"These are terrible. They are thick and ride up. There is no breast compression, and the waist compression is negligible. I bought a small and doesn't do anything but make you look bulky. Also, the fabric is ribbed, and remains so even after you put it on. It's visible under most clothes. It's just junk."
1.0,Got the biggest size and still fit too small everywhere
1.0,"The photos and size chart do not in any way accurately describe this.  Nothing like photos!<br />At 5‚Äô8  113#, a small should not have sleeves hanging past the tips of fingers and arm holes reaching elbows.<br />Extremely thin so if you do buy get a nice tank or cami for under.<br />Nice for a winter beach coverup but nothing else."
1.0,It is completely see through and way too large.
1.0,Wrong size. I wear a 1x and still bought a 2x but still didn't fit
1.0,The shoe in the picture is not what the shoe looks like in real life
1.0,"I had high hopes for this product as it was exactly the material and lightweight fit that I was looking for. However, the product had loose threads everywhere and a small hole in the armpit. For the price, I was expecting a better constructed robe. Returning."
1.0,The most awkward fit ever. These are made for someone huge with an abnormally long butt. It‚Äôs completely baggy and looks horrible. Wish I tried on without taking the tags off.
1.0,"I ordered a 0 to 3 mos & this is more like a 6 mos! My granddaughter is due in June so I ordered it so she could wear it for summer,but at this size it wont fit till winter then it's too cold for it! Guess I wasted money unless they refund me. Very disappointed!!!"
1.0,Hat is very cheaply made.
1.0,Loved the top but made extremely small for size.
1.0,It didn't fit the way I thought it would
1.0,The fit was good but tore up in the wash I would not buy  I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,Had it for only a day or two and the wing charm fell off. Amazon was great and refunded my money right away but I was upset I wanted the keychain. Much smaller then expected as well.
1.0,Its totally different from the picture. Its ugly and you can tell that its a cheap item. Dont buy this. Not worth a dollar.
1.0,Confusing sizing. Looking for a boys small (size 6) and got a size 8.
1.0,"Felt great but only received 1 mask, not 10 as advertised"
1.0,Dress is not as seen on the image
1.0,"Cheap, bad stitching & the color is not as pictured."
1.0,Extremely thin not what we thought
1.0,Wow! This doesn't just run small - it's TINY. I can't even imagine what size I might be if the XL is this tiny.  Maybe 5X?
1.0,"Very unsatisfied. Posts were super short so they did not fit well at all, and the bottom of the post (flat part that goes against inside of lip) was super sharp. Diamonds were cheap, and package did not come with 10 lip rings. Returned and purchased from another seller."
1.0,This is a piece of junk.  I opened it and the first thing that happened when I took it out of the box was the latch hardware fell off.  lol.
1.0,Can't fit to my size unable to fit my size the jewelry store couldn't remove the clips
1.0,"Waaaay too small. If you have a small chest it may work, but for my normal sized chest this is a no go. It would be pretty on my under developed 12 year old cousin probably."
1.0,Baby dress was cute but even after being washed something in the neckline irritated her skin. Toddler dress was too low cut in the front and nothing but string in the back. Not a very age appropriate design.
1.0,"Very cute earrings that matched my outfit perfectly.  However, they pinched my ears very tightly and I could not wear them. There is supposed to be a way to loosen them, but I could not make them comfortable at all..."
1.0,I thought these based on the excellent reviews and was sorely disappointed. They do not stick like others I've purchased for less money. I do not see myself using them again.
1.0,"I am a size 6, and when I put these on the heel of the sock was up well above my ankle. The distance between the heel and toe is quite long."
1.0,Not good quality.  Gets the job done though.
1.0,ugly way to big
1.0,"I have ordered this item twice in a size large, but both times it has come as a small.  It was for a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I finally sent her a gift receipt and she will order something else.  Too bad though.  I thought this was super cute and comfy looking."
1.0,You get even less than you pay for. Not even cute costume jewelry. Colors bled together and wires melded together. Ugly!
1.0,it says when you buy that this runs small but they do not say 'way too small'
1.0,broke so easy
1.0,Tarnished in 2 week
1.0,Cheap fabric<br />Came with seams popping off<br />Came super wrinkled
1.0,They were broken when they arrived
1.0,The color is not black-green and not the same brand name. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the same jacket
1.0,Loved the color and pockets. Unfortunately the fabric has pilled up with just using seatbelt. Looks like was bought at a yard sale after 2 washings. Very disappointed!
1.0,VERY cheaply made. Son didn't even use it once and it came apart in several pieces.
1.0,What a scam.
1.0,company too cheap to show better pics.  cant understand how to use them and wow a pic of them in a pkg. guess if they were any good they'd show it on a pair of shoes. should have read thru the lines . guess my first bad experience with an amazon product. but they were out sourced so your ok amazon. not your fault
1.0,I hate them. They are miserably uncomfortable to wear. And the nose pad arms are so long that the lenses are too far from the eyes.
1.0,It was a piece of junk it came broken its in trash now
1.0,These were ok. The material was very weird. I would compare it to tent material. They were a little long and they seemed to have a bump below the smocking. I am sending them back.
1.0,It came in short sleeve instead of long sleeve. The description said long sleeve and the sticker on the bag even said long aleeve
1.0,Completely let down with this necklace! They also show different shades of blue in the photos and I expected a light blue but I got a dark blue... NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!
1.0,Not disturbed style or length. Disappointed.
1.0,Quality horrible. Length is vey short and color faded.
1.0,Cute dress. Poorly made.  1St time my daughter wore it it tore in 3 places around the waist. I will not by buy another dress from here.
1.0,"I purchased these glasses in May, 2021. They are lightweight and comfortable. The seller was quick to remedy a problem I had. Great customer service! I will absolutely order from this seller again!<br /><br />I am changing this review on 9/4/2021. One pair of the glasses broke less than 6 weeks after I received them. The seller seemed to be willing to replace them. That was 8/19. I still have not received the replacement, nor have I heard anything more from them."
1.0,The 8-9 size or 130 is way too small for my 7-year old. I wish they would have indicated the metric size in their description. It would have prevented an unnecessary purchase.
1.0,These shoes did not last long. My daughter got off the bus and the entire rubber sole had ripped apart from the fabric. Very poor quality.
1.0,I am so disappointed! The earrings are very small. Just for a little girl. But the design more suitable for an old woman.
1.0,The band itself is nice but it does not seems to snap together well. During the day you will notice while wearing this that it comes apart. The band is longer than expected. You would think it would come in different sizes as the one size fits all is not working. This band almost is so long it clamps together right at the start of where the band connect to the watch. These bands should be used for people who have large wrists. Not excited about this purchase at all. Will return!
1.0,i needed wide
1.0,Absolutely trash. There is no difference wearing these at night. Not one. Total waste of funds. 0 stars if I could.
1.0,"Great quality, I was so excited to receive this for my husband. I purchased an xl and it‚Äôs more like a 3 or 4x it‚Äôs waaayyy too big! I‚Äôm so disappointed because it‚Äôs too late to return being as it was for Christmas gift."
1.0,Nice style but quality is horrible.  The seem<br />on the bottom of the top came apart and I<br />Lost a button on the first time I wore it. ( I had washed and hung it up to dry prior to wearing)
1.0,The back of the watch broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,They advertise the lens to be glass but they were the cheaper poly carbonate. The code was 580p but the description says glass. Nothing wrong with the polycarbonate if thats what you purchased
1.0,"This shirt was shorter than it looked on the model, even just when holding it up. The material isn't stretchy at all, so it doesn't give any when you put it on.  The XXL was more like an M."
1.0,"I had very bad experience with this case, when make calls people can hear me or hear me badly. If you buy just to take picture under water is ok, but then you have to swap to another case."
1.0,"i could not even get this on my wrist, it was too small and saying one size fits all is misleading if you have large hands"
1.0,The blouse I received does not resemble the picture on ad.  The blouse that was delivered is a cheaply made and looks nothing like the photograph I viewed online.<br />This feels more like a scam rather than an honest mistake.
1.0,"Cheap fabric, I wouldn't recommend. I want to find a swimsuit like this but I'd say look up the style and find a real store that has this, I don't think I'll ever buy clothes off Amazon again."
1.0,Not what I ordered 2 times.  Wanted 10 small colored feet to use on plaque with 8 hooks.  Two times I received 4 natural colored.  Unfortunately I returned first 4 before second delivery arrived. Packages labeled with picture of 10 brightly colored.
1.0,"I weigh 115 lbs . I ordered size  large and the shirts are too small. They are also shapeless. They do not have waist. I ordered several t - shirts before from Amazon (probably about 20)  and they all had this nice, flattering  hour glass shape -but  not these. They are go straight from bust to hips. Pretty bad.  Not recommended."
1.0,"This dress was ridiculous.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and it hit mid calf on me. I ordered an XL...which according to size chart should have fit great. It fits like a small. The pockets? Ha! Those are hilarious 3 inch deep little flaps that refuse to stay tucked in, and as an added bonus to this dress‚Äôs worthlessness... one pocket is sewn way above the other. No symmetry at all. This purchase was a total waste of money."
1.0,looked great. wore once washed once and it came apart at the seam
1.0,The glasses are nice & like everyone one else stated the temple tips of the shades are sharp. I was very disappointed after I try to order the gold shades with grey lens twice and was delivered the blk frame with blk lens both times.I kept the first incorrect shades due to the fact that I like them for the summer after the second error I return it and won't be ordering again.
1.0,"The zipper on the bottom of this item breaks. I originally ordered two, one for each daughter. One of the onesies arrived with a broken zipper. The other daughter‚Äôs onesie broke the same way within a day."
1.0,The rubber nose protectors fall off when you clean them really easy to lose. Poor design
1.0,The product is see through and the waist tie is basically a shoe lace. Very cheap and can't even be worn as a cover up.
1.0,Ordered red and got black
1.0,"Does not form to your face at all. Leaves huge gaps around your nose, so you might as well not wear it at all. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs protecting you. Also comes with a weird insert. Why not just sew it into the mask itself? It bunches up inside the mask and makes it flare out so that it won‚Äôt form to your face. Taking the insert out doesn‚Äôt help much either, the mask is just too baggy. Very unwise purchase."
1.0,The color was wrong twice! My mother wieghts 112 lbs and is under 5 foot. This was to small for her.
1.0,I am the size of most NFL tackles and this glove is way too small
1.0,This product is the worst. Each pair was a different size. I order 2x but could pull up over knees. My granddaughter is a size 10 and they fit her tight. Misleading
1.0,"P√©rdida de dinero,"
1.0,these are so incredibly tiny!!! Wont even stay on my legs without rolling off.
1.0,"Charged more than retail for the hat, which didn‚Äôt include the pin. There is supposed to be a sunglasses pin (as shown in the picture) but this shipped without it. Disappointed and feel the product was misrepresented."
1.0,Stiff as a board and wont get soft
1.0,I thought these were more like capris but are shorts and not true to size normally ordered.
1.0,Definitely way too big for a nose ring but works ok in my ears.
1.0,I was so excited to receive my bag yesterday. I used it today and the zipper already broke . Super cute bag but its already falling apart amd i haven't even had it for a day. Not happy at all.
1.0,Ordered a 2XL and it fits like a small/medium. Fabric is also really thin and the lettering is different as pictured. Would not recommend.
1.0,Did not fit :-(
1.0,I was so excited to get this and then the outside zipper broke within a few days.  I can't even use it now.  Poor quality.  Will not buy any yaluxe products.
1.0,do not fit correctly
1.0,"I wanted something to use for lap swimming my backyard pool that gave me a larger field of view than traditional goggles.  These worked the first time i put them on, but then leaked when i tried them the next day. They immediately start to fill with water no matter how tight i adjust them."
1.0,It was a tent..... And a  not-very-flattering tent....
1.0,"Not the best.  Threading hanging from bottom, extra material sticking out in the strap."
1.0,Bought as Christmas gift for my daughter. She tries on jacket to find its ripped. I am so upset and am not looking forward to the return process.
1.0,Way too big and some of the headbands were twisted so the knot/bow didn't lay nicely. Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,"Band is coming off.  Wanted to return because I've purchased several of these hats, so know that shouldn't be happening.  Bought a couple of weeks early for a bday gift, and didn't hear back from my giftee until they had used a week or so after getting, but &#34;is past the time for returns&#34;.  It's defective, and it's soon, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Not happy and disappointed in the return policy--30 days when purchasing online and giving a gift is too tight to know if there is an issue or not."
1.0,Nothing like the picture and the material is cheap
1.0,I loved these earrings but they keep breaking. Returned the first pair because the pave ball broke off while the stem was in my ear. The second pair they sent did the same thing.
1.0,La gente se volvio loca? Quien va a pagar esa cantidad de dinero sin estar seguro de ser aut√©ntica?
1.0,Backings are cheap/poor quality.
1.0,"Poor quality, stinky. Absolutely different what you see on photo. Do not recommend to one one buy from this seller. I have a problem to return it back."
1.0,This was very disappointing it's see through thin fabric that looks like it would fall apart the first time it was worn.
1.0,This crap
1.0,The material of the dress is nothing like the picture. The dress looks like a cheap night gown to sleep in
1.0,"The print in the hat is just a really thin plasic print. Looks cheap, shiney, and I'm sure will wear off quickly. World not have purchased if I knew this.  Not worth the $"
1.0,Cheap fell apart after wearing for a few days
1.0,Broke and lost on first wear. Damn.
1.0,"I just bought a REVLON kit because the quality of the blades in this kit is very poor. it causes the nails to split. THIS is one of those items where generic brands just won't do. After I got the REVLON replacements, I threw away all three clippers that came in this kit."
1.0,Purchased as new and the item came with the tag cut out and it was way too small
1.0,"Don't try to clean the post with rubbing alcohol, you will damage the material of the earrings. I don't know about you, but I just don't put studs in without proper cleaning so I don't know what to do with these. I have cute earrings that I can't wear. The picture was the first day I worn this design."
1.0,I ordered 2 of these and both were sewn wrong. The white lining was showing on both. Had to return them
1.0,These are NOT LINEN and Amazon is out of line for continue to allow false advertising.
1.0,Ordered for use on Halloween. Disappointed! Wont be using this product. Poor quality and bent. Throwing in the trash...
1.0,Don‚Äôt even think about it
1.0,This the fourth hat that I have bought but this one is a bit different. Instead of being in a box it was in a sack so it was wadded up like scrap paper. I won't be buying any more hats.
1.0,I never ordered these mask.
1.0,Completely cheaply made.  Bought as part of a gift for my niece and am so embarrassed to see the poor quality of the top.  Looks like something I'd buy from Walmart or Rainbow Shoppes.  Stitches clearly showing and flimsy material.  Looks like it will rip in a washing machine.
1.0,My wife wore this 2 times and the stitching is coming apart in the seam that holds the top together. This swim suit is pure crap. Dont waste your time or money on this.
1.0,Bad quality material Nd fit. It looks nothing like in picture. The dress came in tight A line fitting with cheap material. Hated it..!!
1.0,It held nothing in. Returned it immediately.
1.0,Don‚Äôt waste your money. Cheap and has an extremely awkward fit.
1.0,"This dress is laughably small. I ordered an XXL. I'm a size 18 but it fits my aunt, a size 8, perfectly. 10 sizes off? Ridiculous. Took forever to get here as well."
1.0,product does not fit at all.  My arms can't even get in the dress lol.  Definitely need to go up a size or two.
1.0,"Thought these would be nice for a multiple earring look. Sadly these are heavy & do not hang correctly. Would not recommend, I returned them ."
1.0,Wore these TWICE and there's already a hole where there shouldn't be. Cheap cheap cheap.
1.0,Unusable due to the wire being disconnected from the contact.
1.0,"it was lovely, but poorly made.  I got size small and thats what I always wear  This was so small and tight, I could not get it over my head. It was smaller than a xs.  I actually had go to my front porch and thankfully across the street was my lady neighbor outside and I had to call her over to help me get out of the top of the suit.  I didn't try the bottoms on<br />as there was no sense.  I bought my daughter the same pair and size and hers was better in that she got it on, but it was tight under the arms.  She aid what I thought,  I wish it fit better as it is a really nice PJ set.  No more PJ's from this company..."
1.0,Only worn 1 time washed on gentle and no dryer.  Fell apart at waist seem.
1.0,"The necklace looks nothing like the picture. First, it was a horse and not a unicorn. Second, the back and neck are to make the part of the heart and it was the hair. The heart was odd shaped."
1.0,doesn't even look like they tried with the image. it was blurry and smudge when it arrived. I personally wouldn't even pay $5.00 for that lame attempt at that apple watch band!!!
1.0,"The high magnification must be the cause of the ""coke bottle"" fit of glasses and frames.<br />They fall off my face constantly."
1.0,Very much over priced for the quality and fit...  I could have done much better with a $5.00 China Town deal.
1.0,"If you order this product, you need to order 1 to 2 sizes too big. Product runs very small."
1.0,If you‚Äôre purchasing over a M and have any kind of curve this dress is not for you. Looks cute on the model. Looks horrible on. It was straight static coming out of the shipping bag. I put it on and felt like a ruffled cabbage patch doll. I could have sized down (between X and XX normally) and the elastic around the waist was more like around the fupa area. Immediately returning
1.0,One of them was not properly sown
1.0,"The shirt is made up of three separate pieces of fabric. The one I received was sewn incorrectly, so the grey lines were twisted. I was not impressed."
1.0,The colors are not vibrant as it looks in ad. The colors are washed out and dull
1.0,Bought for husband to replace champion jacket he loved. Shiny material with large emblem on back were non starters.
1.0,They turned copper and green after 1 wear
1.0,Came without a back
1.0,They look really cheap. I have purchased similar products from different sellers and regardless of price they are not cheap looking. The stud part of the earring looks like it is being held together by white caulk instead of the grey appearing substance in the picture. They were not meant to be a long lasting pair of earrings but I likely won't wear these at all.
1.0,"I bought this jacket in size that were specified on the size scale, but I had a very small size. I'm not happy. Very bad."
1.0,"This is the worst hat I have ever bought, if I could give this a ZERO rating I would. The hat pictured IS NOT THE HAT THEY SEND...it's really small and really thin...please don't buy this hat I promise you will hate it"
1.0,"First off, this is way too big for my wrist.  I looked into cutting the band, but in order to do so you would need to cut the band.  The clasp you have to bend in order to get it off the band, but then it can't clasp properly.  Second, the band is so stiff it isn't a complete circle.  It doesn't sit right on my wrist and the cross seems to tilt until it is upside down under my wrist.  I don't like that.  It is a lot thicker than anticipated as well.  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
1.0,No tiene sinturon....
1.0,"These shoes are not as advertised or listed. The fabric lining is not cotton as advertised, but polyeurethane foam-backed polyester batting; it is 100% synthetic. The bottom insoles are polyester covered foam, and beneath the insole is PVC plastic (vinyl) that lines the entire leather interior sole of the shoe, and the insole is heavily glued to the plastic sole liner. Your child's foot never actually touches any leather whatsoever on the inside of the shoe, only synthetic materials, which does not allow the foot to breathe--therefore goes against the entire point of a leather moccasin. How do I know this? Well, my 4 YO daughter has never had foot odor from any shoe, but after only one day of wearing these, her feet were sweating profusely in the shoe (not breathing, a telltale sign of synthetics), so much so that the lining was soaked with sweat after wearing them at school, and her feet smelled (this has never happened to her with another shoe). I was then very skeptical of the shoe but she loved them and insisted upon wearing them again the next day, and at the end of another school day, after only 2 days--not only did her feet smell again, but the lining had fallen apart and started peeling and falling out. (Note this also, from other reviewers.) Once unglued and turned inside out, I was able to fully see the floral polyester fabric construction batting lining backed (glued to) with a thin, puffy layer of polyeurethane foam (very easy to spot for one who understands fabrics and textiles); and when the polyeurethane foam insole had fallen out, I was totally shocked at seeing the fully clear PVC plastic-lined bottom of the shoe, where I thought leather would be. No wonder her foot cannot breathe! I was shocked; shocked at how unhealthy these materials are for a growing foot, at the misleading advertising (knowing that moms want leather and cotton and not synthetics and plastics), and at the price of this shoe advertised as if it is high quality materials (which is what moms like me are willing to pay extra money for), when it most definitely is not.<br /><br />God only knows what all the glues are made of that your child's foot is breathing in (onto the skin = into the blood), as these are made in PRC; and we already know how unhealthy PVC plastic is. Also, because they have already been dishonest about the lining being cotton when it is not, the fact that the shoe's leather never touches the foot and they feel the need to fully line it with a fabric, it leads me to wonder whether it is scrap leather or uncertified leather (which can contain lead, often used to treat and soften leather) that may not meet or be compliant with US regulations/requirements and therefore must be covered so that it is not in contact with the skin. At this point, having discovered the truth about the shoe, I wouldn't put it past the quality standards (or lack thereof) of this company. I am deeply disappointed in these shoes and this company and highly suggest they tell the truth about their products. I cannot recommend them and returned them for a full refund. (Photos to come.) There are other companies out there that make certified, safe leather shoes with safe materials for babies and children, so you'd be better off investing your money elsewhere, with transparent companies and products that can bring you peace of mind."
1.0,"Not put together right. The left sleeve is slightly askew and feels much tighter than the right sleeve. The seam doesn't go straight up leading to a weird look. I washed as instructed and hung dry after first wear and just washing caused a hole in the collar area. The stomach fits weird too. I am usually a medium however this is too snug in all the wrong places....my hubs said I looked bloated. And it is really long, almost could be a dress but not quite. Regret this purchase."
1.0,Retuning website says 14 inches but the description says 15 inches and 2 inch extender VERY DISAPPOINTED ITS TOO BIG I WANT A CHOCKER THIS is not on me
1.0,I would give this no stars if possible. These are basically just really terrible quality red and blue goggles with some tiny paw patrol stickers on the side that Would surely come off if wet. Save your money!
1.0,If you're buying this wallet for your back pocket...It is very large.
1.0,It came broken!
1.0,These run incredibly small. I'm a 9 in women's and it feels more like a 7.5. Very stiff when walking. Returning asap
1.0,"The thing is crap very thin cheap material,  the sleeves were two different lengths,  it said size runs small so I  ordered 2 sizes larger and I couldn't even get my arm  in the sleeve,  when I contacted the company for a refund they said sure but they won't cover return postage for which it would cost me over $100. Don't buy from this company ever or you will regret it!"
1.0,"So tiny I cant even opening the claw! I wanted it for my purse, but its so tiny!"
1.0,Very disappointed. Ordered for a fitbit flex. The fitbit won't go into holder. Doesn't fit well around a standard size strap. Wasted my money
1.0,It looks like the beads are small. But they aren't. I thought it was a much smaller bracelet. It's very pretty but bigger than I thought.
1.0,did not like product.  Was cheaply made and a comfortable fit at all.
1.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù with a larger lower body. I bought their largest size figuring it‚Äôd compensate for my figure which seemed to be the resolution until I turned around. This dress literally just covered my but- any slight movement and Im mooning the world! It‚Äôs a shame because I really really like this dress.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre a bit larger on the bottom then this isn‚Äôt the dress for.
1.0,"More of a costume hat,"
1.0,"Ugliest hats ever, wouldn't recommend. They dont look as cool as in the picture, look like turbans almost."
1.0,This pant is nice but try to get a bigger size
1.0,This fabric is cheap and the fit is frumpy. I ordered a small and it is baggy and just hangs there. Sad :(
1.0,Size runs small. Straps are thin and cheap.
1.0,"Awful, to me.  Fabric is shiny and slick like cheap nylon. I sent back a sleeveless one in same pattern with nice fabric- will be reordering it to wear with a light sweater or jacket.üòí"
1.0,I bought these glasses because they said they were fog resistant. They fogged up within the first hour! Very disappointed and will not buy again
1.0,"The material is something you would expect from a costume. The sleeves have white mesh material and not what the product looks like as advertised. The length of the ""shirt"" is shorter than expected as well."
1.0,"I bought these for my daughter since they said they were ""gold plated"" and she needs to wear gold plated post earrings. I received them today and took them out of the package to see the posts are NOT gold plated. I think the front may be gold plated, but that isn't what I was looking for! Very upset.  The actual fronts of the earrings are cute, so I'm debating whether to keep for myself or return.<br />DO NOT buy these if you're looking for gold plated posts.<br /> Edit: Found these exact same earrings in Walmart for $3.00 a few days after purchasing them here. So mad I was ripped off and didn't return these."
1.0,Romper is really cute and fits as expected but the strap was ripped off when I opened The package
1.0,"Ordered a slouchy, wide-neck, thin sweatshirt. Instead, I received a short-sleeved, very small cut (like 2-3 sizes smaller than expected) paper thin tshirt. Immediately returned. Not sure what the game is here, but will definitely beware of this seller in future."
1.0,Disliked that I didn‚Äôt even have it a month and it failed to keep its elasticity. The edges started fraying.
1.0,Despite following size guide item is too small.  To return I must ship to China at $45.  Do not purchase.  Never have I ever had to ship back to another country!
1.0,Did not receive the color I ordered. The hat was huge no way would it fit an infant. The quality of the garment is awful.
1.0,"My mom asked me order this dress for her because she liked how this dress looked in the pictures but she wanted me to make sure the dress is not too light. I see some review say the dress is made of heavy material, some say very thin. By looking at the picture of the material, it does look heavy to me so I thought I‚Äôd take a chance. We received the dress today and she was not pleased with how thin the material is and asked me to send it back. Also, I wanted to say that the size chart is incorrect. She measured XL according the the chart but after reading some comments I decided to buy a medium which is the size she normally wears and it fit just right. I wonder if they make a heavier version of the dress but I have no idea how to contact the merchants. :("
1.0,Poor quality.  Cheap material. Logo was crooked.
1.0,Slight green tint maybe.
1.0,"Washed this item for my daughter for xmas photoshoot. The white strips are now pink and the shirt is so tight. My kid isnt even 2 yet, got a 3t (clearly knew it was china size, so I went up) and the shirt is literally skin tight. Brand name clothing that is 2t is loose on my kid. Wish I would have put her in it before buying another set to make up for the white being dyed pink. Going to hang dry the next set.<br />*Advice... wash cold, separate and hang dry."
1.0,A large hole developed along seam in pants after one wash.
1.0,The &#34;voice&#34; is sword noises I have never been so insulted
1.0,I have really been disapppointed in the appearance of these earrings. They look like play/toy jewelry with to much eye blinding glare. Clearly not for everyday use. I can‚Äôt even give them to my 7 year old grand daughter to play with. Ugly pieces. There was nothing inside the package. No receipt etc so can‚Äôt return.
1.0,The color is awful.  I bought them because they're 4.00 which has been impossible to find in my area. I tried painting the rims with nail polish and would send them back but I lost the packing information. Order No. 105-70777665-9376206 but I don't see a product link.
1.0,"It looks so good, but the cord around the hoop unravelled less than 2 min after putting my glasses on it. So disappointing. Rather than trying to fix it myself and making it worse, I sent it back."
1.0,So unflattering. They looked like scrubs
1.0,Had to return. Product runs small. Ordered a toddler size 9 & it was really closer to a size 8 when I compared it to another similar clog.
1.0,This dress is very small and very long
1.0,fell apart as soon as i got it
1.0,This is made out of such thin cheap material I doubt it would stand up to more than a couple of washes. Sent back.
1.0,It is too small if you can change it. I will appreciate that.
1.0,It‚Äôs stiff material not very soft
1.0,My husband hated it. Looks too cheap. Need to return asap
1.0,"WHEN THE NECKLACE ARRIVED, THE STONES WERE OUT. I HAD TO GLUE THEM IN. ALSO, ONE OF THE STONES WAS MISSING. SO, I HAD TO REMOVE THE MATCHING MISSING THAT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE. I VISITED BEAD CENTERS WITH NO LUCK TO REPLACE THE MISSING STONE. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!"
1.0,The lenses keep falling out
1.0,"I bought a set in March 2017, and within the first week or so, one of the nose pads fell out.  Another week later, one of the lenses popped out.  Lather, rinse, repeat with the other 4 pairs, making me find replacements within 4 months.  I like to strategically place them around my house and like to keep a pair in my purse.<br />Did I learn?  NO!  I thought the price was worth the disposable glasses and reordered them last October.  Repeat the first paragraph.  I use them while refinishing wood furniture.  The missing nose pad would give me a slight headache and wouldn't stay in place... unless I wanted to superglue them to my nose???"
1.0,Broke in 1 month...
1.0,The shirt did not look anything like the picture shown. It was short and no pockets
1.0,"Stickers are hard to remove and are very uncomfortable, will only work for very small breasts. not practical at all"
1.0,Rips easily through the crotch. Just purchased and already have holes in seams. Don't waste your money. Returns are a hassle.
1.0,Lost the gold color  on the charm
1.0,Material very flimsy and see through
1.0,This came extremely dirty and really misshaped. I was able to clean it and stuff it with a few shirts to re shape it but still.. come on.
1.0,"I don't know what kind of torso this is meant for -- the holes aren't even close to lining up the way they, ahem, should.  I actually bought 2 sizes because I didn't know which one would work (and they both had free returns so I figured I'd return the one that didn't fit), but neither one was anywhere close to fitting.  Too bad, bought this to have some fun in the bedroom but returned both because they're terrible.  Don't bother.  Pass, seriously."
1.0,No. Very ugly. Somehow blocky. Returning.
1.0,Such a cute looking pair of pants too bad they were made out of such thin see through material
1.0,Cheaply made...a wear once kind of item
1.0,These earrings are beautiful but too big for my face. They do not look so big in the models in the add. I believe the ones they are wearing are smaller than the ones I got!!! I wish they were a lot smaller!!!
1.0,I ordered the XL for myself. They were tiny and They fit my nine year old.
1.0,Loved the hat but size was too big.
1.0,Cheap fabric . No shape .
1.0,"This material is awful, and smells nasty ü§¢, will never purchase again‚Ä¶"
1.0,Had to return - it was much too small.
1.0,Items broke after first use!
1.0,It‚Äôs crap if there is even the slightest slightest wind
1.0,Buckles that wrap around the pant belt straps where on backwards & before I knew it the adjustable part broke off
1.0,"The bottoms run really small. I wear a size 6 shorts at Old Navy and I got an XL and it is too tight. The top did not fit either, it was too big. I originally ordered a large and had to return it because the bottoms were too small."
1.0,The strap tore off the second week I had it. üòñ
1.0,"Beautiful product, Broke within hours. Need to get it replaced üòï"
1.0,At least one of the &#34;stones&#34; was made of plastic.
1.0,"The wires were too small for size and had to be taken out, the bust without the underwire has no support, and the straps were way too long, even adjusted to the shortest length."
1.0,Don't waste your money. Plastic clips break as soon as you take a purse off the hook.
1.0,Product was too small...I want to return it but don't have a printer to print out a return label...so I'm stuck with it I guessüòí
1.0,"I purchased the black ones, and while I had no problem getting into and out of them, the quality is why I will be giving them away; and YES, they do smell loud and will need to sit outside overnight. I did have to use an insole for a more snug fit and they still caused pain after wearing them for only an hour or so. One get what one pays for. If like me, you‚Äôre use to a more high-end quality shoe, these are not the boots for you."
1.0,Fit good until I washed it and it shrank in Length
1.0,Picture speaks for itself.  This is child sized. Nothing like the image.  Wish I could return it. Do not fall for it.
1.0,So the suit looks great.  It feels great.  I loved it until I noticed the rear seam had about an 1/8 of an inch gap which you can see through.  THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE!
1.0,The material is so rough that it actually chaffed the inside of my arm while I was working out. I bought it to use for working out.. running.. in these high summer temperatures.<br />Fit is somewhat smaller than expected.
1.0,False Advertisement
1.0,Terrible and cheap looking
1.0,Very light weight. Started to tarnish after a few wears
1.0,No good. To small...
1.0,Lens do not darken in direct sunlight.  False advertising!
1.0,"Ordered two sizes up, but still too small. Seller discouraged returning for a refund. Offered a ridiculous 8 percent refund to keep & not return. Will not order from this seller again."
1.0,Does not look like the photo at all. You can't even tell what it is! Very poor quality!
1.0,"Not what I expected.  They are clunky and don't sit on my ear right, making it look awkward (which it is)."
1.0,"This is marketed as a fleece cardigan. It is really just a thin polyester cheap cardigan. 95% polyester, 5% spandex. The inside is not as shown, but rather the underside of the polyester. It both looks and feels cheap. Steer clear of this."
1.0,Not for women over size 36. Maybe not even 34.
1.0,Received almost a month later than promised and has one of the names wrong... :(
1.0,"The color and look is nice, but the band pops off regularly. I have purchased other bands and never had this experience. It‚Äôs garbage."
1.0,"Muy mala calidad, y corre muy peque√±o"
1.0,"Ridiculously small.  Couldn't even get them on.  Material seemed like it might be OK, but had to return because of the size."
1.0,The rings are extremely poor quality.  They stretched putting on and one hard tug they will break.
1.0,Did not look like picture. I threw it in trash!!!!
1.0,"My wife bought these and was excited as she has seen several wide and soft headbands that would keep her hair secured as she bikes and works in the food industry constantly cooking and prepping. But when they got her she was shocked at the quality and purity of color. She overlooked the color because she realized they are the colors she requested and decided to give them a shot. First she inspected them, her first response was OMG I think i got taken advantage of because i spent money for someone to just cut the leg of their yoga pants and add a tag.  She decided to wear them and liked how she could manipulate the size of the bands and thought they would be great as moisture wicking. So she wore them to work and was upset that they kept bundling up and slipping out of place or rising up in her head making her look like somebody put on a do rag and forgot to tie the back down. they did moisture wick and looked soaked during her shift and picked up the smell or the onions and peppers she was cutting. We washed the one she wore and guess what...it shrunk. overall, not a great product and she feels really ripped off; also we cannot return them as she wore the one. Overpriced cut up pants that took to long to get here, just not a great experience. not using this seller or brand again."
1.0,Horrible ! Ordered exact size but all buttons open up
1.0,Had to return. Runs very small. Sharp piece inside toe
1.0,I exchanged it the first time because it was too tight in the chest. Then I got an ENTIRELY different product that wasn't close to the first. Retuned that & I'm STILL waiting on my refund.
1.0,"Too big, cheap material. Had holes from loose seems when I opened the package."
1.0,Don't waste your money buying these Apple watch bands. Put the band on my watch today and it fell apart.
1.0,This product was way too pointy. Made you look like an ant eater.
1.0,"It's beautiful dress, I really like the style and color even though it is not as orange as it showed in the picture. But the material is so cheap, the seam starts to show tear before I put it on. I think I am going to return it. :("
1.0,"While the jumpsuit is beautiful, it is WAY too big. The 0-3 month ""newborn infant"" size is big enough for my 2 year old! I'm very disappointed."
1.0,I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SWEATSHIRT. It was so little and the hood wasn't even an actual hood.. Was not impressed.
1.0,Talla xsmall parece no talla M es s√∫per peque√±a
1.0,"Runs far, far too large."
1.0,"Very beautiful but they broke from my waist while standing on my first day, a complete mess."
1.0,"I just missed the return window, but the size 6-8 was way too small for my 6-year-old.  Buying a new one and will donate our unused one."
1.0,Fun and intersting but not really functional
1.0,This is a large for maybe a 4 month old infant! Ridiculous.
1.0,Returned because of flimsy material. Not at all acceptable.
1.0,Cheap dont do it! Just dont.
1.0,"Convert the cm to inches and decide if this sizing will work for you. Sadly, if the size is as off as it is, it makes me really wonder about the integrity of everything else!"
1.0,"I know my correct size and even measured to be sure, but these jeans fit my very big husband and you would have to be 7 feet tall for the length to fit."
1.0,"Got a hole in it after 1 wash, very poor quality and much wider fit that the photo shows. Should have returned"
1.0,"This is the thinnest material I have ever seen in a t-shirt! A cheap, poorly made import shirt from China. Thanks to Amazon and their generous return policy, I have already processed a return."
1.0,We returned this item - it did not fit properly
1.0,It was way to small. It fits my 1 year old granddaughter. Definitely not a large adult.
1.0,I loved the old Amanda jeans.  I don‚Äôt know what happened but they are not the same. I bought a pair that were 3 inches too long. They don‚Äôt sit as high on my hips. They have more stretch to them then before so after I‚Äôve worn them for a couple of hours they start sliding down. The material is weird now too. Sometimes they smell like chemicals and it takes several washings to get rid of it. I hate these jeans now. I‚Äôll never buy another pair from a store again. The only ones I buy now is from thrift stores. Even they are getting hard to find. I‚Äôm sure this was all done to save money. The quality is gone. I noticed that the ‚ÄúGloria Vanderbilt‚Äù has even almost all washed off a pair. I wish when she sold the company she would have stipulated that they can‚Äôt change one thing about her jeans. I doubt they are jeans she would want her name on anyway. I guess it‚Äôs good that it washes off.
1.0,"OMG, the hood on this top was sewn on backwards!!!!  Get what you pay for."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt fit well/look flattering at all. Fabric was kind of scratchy (didn‚Äôt keep it long enough to see what it was made of) and very thin. Sealed back up and returned within minutes of opening it.
1.0,"I bought the green jacket and ordered XXL as I would for any top that is 100% cotton. When it arrives, it was a lighter green and had silver snaps, not the darker snaps. The fit in the shoulder is boxy, and the fabric is itchy. It was a little big, so I adjusted the waist and cuffed the sleeves but decided it would need washed and maybe be a better fit. Unfortunately, that's when I found out the jacket was dry clean. Only. For this, I had to return it. I didn't want to take the chance of washing it as it probably had chemicals giving it a stiffer feel, and this was the reason why it would need to be dry cleaned. It is chemically treated to make it stiffer this explains the boxy look and the itchiness of the fabric.<br /><br />UPDATE: Buyer beware! There is no free return, they charge for shipping, and this is a knockoff from overseas. I wish I had more recourse than this review."
1.0,"not vintage. made of cheap plastics. misleading headlines suck.the rose is made of plastic,the chain is plastic pretending to be metal. don't buy."
1.0,This product is very see through. I have been a small in many other brands and never have had the fabric so sheer. Felt amazing but maybe would be that way if you go a size or two bigger.
1.0,"Low quality, the frame on these cracked within a day from removing from box under light use. I do have a second pair that haven't failed yet.... So possibly a fluke..."
1.0,These are cut wayyy small go a size up from what you normally wear trust me it won‚Äôt fit if you do your normal size
1.0,Absolutely terrible item. Not sterling silver. Some sort of plastic that could bend without effort.  Worst purchase ever
1.0,Received the wrong size. I ordered a large and received medium.
1.0,"This is great for a few uses as an accessory. The quality is not very high, but you get what you pay for.<br />They are a cute addition to my sunglasses.<br /><br />Update: Right after I wrote this review I brought it with me to use a second time and the plastic part broke almost instantly. I might be able to jerry-rig this to get it to stay, but I'm not happy right now. I should have been able to get more than 1 use in."
1.0,Nothing like the picture!! False advertisement! Will never order from this vendor again! Reporting this vendor!!
1.0,"Clasp won't stay closed....Very Sad, this Imitation metal looks nice... but sadly the clasp is poorly designed. there isn't a latch, lock or even a bump to keep the clasp closed. And Now I've missed my window for return, very bummed."
1.0,L-XL too small for my size 12 feet.
1.0,I was so disappointed when i got these. It looks so cheap and has bubbles in the blade. Not happy.
1.0,"I love watches and would like to say I'm a watch collector and enthusiast in the beginning stages. I own a tungsten watch, however it's not coated and shines brilliantly silver/platinum like shine. I've been searching for a black coated tungsten watch for a few months already, and when I saw this one it was EXACTLY what I was looking for. I hardly ever take chances on low priced Asian products but I just had to on this one, the only reason why I tried it was because it was backed by amazon prime. However, to my demise and disappointment, it was too good to be true. I was hoping that it wasn't 60 bucks original price, but they dropped it from the advertised 160 to get people to buy their watch, and was of 160 dollar quality. Since there weren't any legit reviews I decided to take a shot and see for myself, couldn't let up such a good deal!<br />REVIEW:<br />The watch face itself looks great, at first glance the whole watch looks good. The hands were functioning just fine no anomalies apparent. Upon closer inspection you can notice the inferior quality, particularly in the links. The links feel flimsily put together, not firm by any means. The clasp is also feels very flimsy. The package included a link remover, the instructions were all in Chinese like writing, the intro to the manual was in English but the actual instructions, uselessly weren't. I've removed links from watches before, this one didn't have tiny arrows to indicate the direction you're supposed to push out the link and the manual was useless on the matter. Took a wild shot, attempted to remove a link from the side which the crown sits, and the link completely chipped and broke, I used a small hammer and was lightly tapping it, even with that, the link broke. (the wristband is ceramic, not tungsten at all) . Seeing I probably came in the wrong direction, the next link I did the other way and the same thing happened. I decided to stop and call it quits with this watch.<br /><br />If this seems too good to be true, its because it is. Take my word for it and spend a little more money on a trusted brand. Never going to take a gamble with shady foreign goods, with even shadier descriptions. I honestly feel robbed, I will attempt to return it to amazon under these conditions.<br /><br />*Update* Amazon didn't hassle me at all over the return, and was returned the 60 dollars in full and promptly as well. That's why I do prime purchases only!"
1.0,"Once you receive this item, you'll see it looks nice in the picture. However, it really looks like a toy chain. It's plastic like. Not worth the purchase. Even if it's $3.00 save your change."
1.0,"Gave this a a gift for my nephew, he was so excited when it tried it on. Following day wheb he was ready to go out and show off his new sneakers, lights went off on one shoe.  It was charged and wouldn‚Äôt turn on. Never saw him so sad."
1.0,Cute but doesnt last. Broke after wearing for 1 day.
1.0,stone is nice but came marred.  I didnt know they made a chain this small.  If it tangles it will take two needles and good eyesight and about thirty minutes to untangle.  Thats what it took me.  If you like the stone plan on buying another chain.
1.0,Item ordered was XL fit more like a medium. Super sad - cause it is cute!
1.0,Does not even look like a heart. Theyre both lop sided and the top heart doesn't even line up with the bottom
1.0,"Very bad watch not worth a cent. not conformable, water get inside the watch you can see the water under the glass and freezing a lot."
1.0,"based on the pictures they have on the item, and the other reviews for people of similar size to be (6ft, 190lb), I thought this shirt would be perfect. Be warned. It fits terribly. I have a picture of me wearing one of my other shirts for comparison. In addition, its very tight in the arms. I bought a large, and the sleeves dont make it to my wrist, nor can I pull it up towards my elbows because it's too tight on the forearms. If you want an athletic/slim cut shirt, look elsewhere.<br /><br />As a side note, the material matches this price point. It is not a nice feeling. It doesn't feel like plastic like a cheap tshirt, but it also doesn't feel like a nice polo material like you might expect based on their images"
1.0,"UPDATE: Reordered these as I needed some replacements. The new bands are nothing like the originals. Very thin, basically have to wear 2 to equal one from my original order. Basically worthless.<br /><br />Old school terry cloth works great. Yea, they are thicker but the newer thinner ones reach saturation too fast and are useless for me. These absorb a lot of sweat. If you bike, you will need to adjust your helmet for the added thickness but it's great not having to stop several times for the sole purpose of wiping sweat out of your eyes."
1.0,Locket is not Illuminist. Appears the inside had something in it as there's either glue or some other dried out sticky material is on the back of the locket. Also there is a hinge on the bottom of the locket which scratches the neck.
1.0,Good started chipping after a week
1.0,These are super ugly in real life...and a large would fit my 11 year old.
1.0,I wore them one time not even two hours later there was a hole in the crotch. I think I will stick with el-cheepo brands they last longer.
1.0,Sure buy this if you enjoy staph infections.
1.0,SUPER CUTE! But broke before I could even get it on... I‚Äôm totally bummed cus I was so excited to get them! They came fast! But didn‚Äôt last :(
1.0,It shows a Blue Shirt with Silver hearts and blue stripes on the sleeve in the pictures on amazon. I received a shirt that was blue and had some ugly brown hearts and different colors sleeves. I returned this item already.
1.0,The breast cups were huge! Even for my large busted sister who tried it on.
1.0,"I order these because I really need the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù but when they arrived they were not white at all, in fact they were closer to yellow than white! Very upsetting! Do not get if you really need white!"
1.0,"I have a hard time finding shoes in my size to begin with, so I was very exciting to get these in a US size 15 Men‚Äôs.<br /><br />When they arrived I could immediately tell they weren‚Äôt even close. They were labeled as a US men‚Äôs 15 but they were more like a size 8."
1.0,Stolen art.
1.0,Inappropriate for little girls
1.0,"bottom too small, top too big"
1.0,"fits very small, cheap material."
1.0,"The glasses I received was bifocals and not multifocal. The focal area of the lens was very pronounced, unlike no line lens. Glasses had a noticeable tint. Looked cheap."
1.0,"Cheap, no ties on the back of it. No extra piece of material to lace it up with like in the pictures."
1.0,Was mid sized by a lot
1.0,can't even wear this because it's so small.
1.0,Not as described poor poor quality cheap quality
1.0,"THE STRAP BROKE, POOR QUALITY. COULDNT WEAR IT"
1.0,"If I could give these 0 stars, I would. My sister ordered these leggings and told me I should as well because she loved hers. However, like others have said, if you purchase these leggings and they don‚Äôt get fulfilled by Hawthorne, they are not the same. They are cheap, gross feeling material leggings shipped from China. Mine were about 2 sizes too big and the crotch is so long that I can literally pull them over my boobs. Horrible horrible experience. Won‚Äôt be ordering again. I‚Äôm really disappointed by the quality control."
1.0,"Material was terrible like plastic,legs had no stretch. I couldn‚Äôt even put it on. Definitely order a size up"
1.0,"Item was way to big, sizing was completely wrong. Plus it had lose threads and was cheaply made."
1.0,Was not true in size too small.
1.0,Flimsy and not worth the value it's listed as. I don't appreciate paying 12 dollars for something I could have made with my own crappy crafts skills because that's how it showed up to me: ready to fall apart.
1.0,No bigger than a dime. Very  misleading.
1.0,Very cheap would not buy again
1.0,"The dress is see through, you can literally see everything under which is very disappointing. The dress constantly rolls up and just not worth it at all"
1.0,literally came undone on the 2nd day.
1.0,So disappointed! Picture shows them to be a nice size. As much as they cost it‚Äôs ridiculous! Will be returning
1.0,"Couldn't even get it all the way on. The size charge said I'd need a 2X so I ordered a 3X, but it wasn't even close to big enough. I want to order another one because it looked so nice and the fabric felt super comfortable, but who knows just how high I'll have to go to get the right size"
1.0,It's wasn't what I wanted.
1.0,Nearly lost my new Fitbit.  Without any warning the band disconnects from the Fitbit.  I didn‚Äôt bump it at all.  I called Fitbit to make sure I was attaching it correctly and I was.  Thank goodness I was at home and found it on the floor.  This happened 3 different times.  (At home of course cause I would never have trusted it to wear outside.)
1.0,the clasp broke after 2 weeks of wearing! it looks ok but isn't durable. I am giving up on my swatch
1.0,Does not look at all as described. It cost 20 dollar‚Äôs to return.
1.0,The shoulder strap is too short to be useable in any fashion. The straps for the paddle board itself are of proper length / circumference to use on the board. The shoulder carry strap needs to be twice as long at minimum to actually be useable.
1.0,It was easy to attached to my watch and low cost but it‚Äôs junk looking for another brand it keeps snagging all my clothes ruined new shirts already not smooth on the edges not well made Iike my last one picture shows the new one in the watch and the old one replaced it because it‚Äôs started snagging my clothes after 2 years .I added another pic you can see how it snags clothes I tossed in garbage after this last shirt I ruined üò°
1.0,really oversized - can't use it.
1.0,Crappy zipper but a pretty good light tool bag is what I use it for
1.0,Wish I could give it a minus 5 stars.  I am a Large and ordered an XL based on reviews.  Receive one without sleeves and it may fit a small thin boy.
1.0,Not true to size chart!!üòû
1.0,"Blue coating is coming off after two weeks. Total junk, don't waste your money!! Have bought rinngs before from other company and blue never came off."
1.0,I am shocked! The earring came not attached to the post!!! How am I supposed to put this in my ears? I don't even feel like sending back. Beware because mine came broken. I needed these for photoshoot. Smh
1.0,"I don't understand why anyone gave this so many stars. It's a dress shirt made out of wind breaker material. Like literally. When you move around, it makes noise. It's ridiculous. And I had to order a size larger than usual based on others reviews (not that I'll ever wear it)."
1.0,"They were all shoved into small plastic bags, and then shipped. When I opened the bag, half of the jewels were in the bottom of the bag from falling off, and one chain was completely broke. I could glue the jewels back on, but the chain was completely broke off."
1.0,Warning- this is not sweatshirt material.  The material is slippery and shiny.  It looks horrible!
1.0,"Was not secure in wrapper, clasp not poped in place, wrapper was open. Ear rings randomly in box, and missing clasp. Beautiful if all pieces were recieved."
1.0,These things are huge. They are novelty glasses. I really expected John Lennon style glasses that I could wear to go out. This is great for Halloween.
1.0,"This product does this exact OPPOSITE of its sales pitch. Every one of them bunches up, making it uncomfortable to wear"
1.0,"It came not working and a friend and I still couldn't get them to work. Total waste, not worth it to attempt a send back."
1.0,"I attempted to get service on a watch I bought locally only to discover they are in receivership.  It is a law firm that now controls their web domain.<br /><br />Per their Whois.com registration:<br />  Registrant:<br />  chapter 11 group<br />  2020 ne 163 st Ste 300<br />  n.miami beach, Florida 33162<br />  United States<br /><br />  Administrative Contact:<br />  diener, ashley<br />  chapter 11 group<br />  2020 ne 163 st Ste 300<br />  n.miami beach, Florida 33162<br />  United States<br />  (305) 944-9100"
1.0,"Disappointed,  expected them to fit my face better. Entirely too small."
1.0,"They claim to be adult size, but they must mean for a very small adult.  Not even my wife who is 5.3 could use this."
1.0,I guess you get what you pay for. Cheaply made and don't fit properly. All but one broke on me.
1.0,"This hat broke after first use, opened it just 4 times and it broke. I purchased early for a wedding so the return date has gone by. VERY POOR QUALITY...GOOD LUCK"
1.0,Poor explanation of product.  Daughter received so called sneakers and she said they feel like water shoes not sneakers.  Totally mislead!
1.0,These earrings look cute on but the post broke after only 2 days
1.0,Very cheap material -_-
1.0,Received smaller piece without any explanation.
1.0,The bottoms fit so weird. The gathered in the crouch like they were backwards. Really uncomfortable. True to size .
1.0,Broke the day I used it. Don't waste that money whether.50 cents or 500 don't just throw money out
1.0,Not as pictured give it away
1.0,The first thing my husband said was ate those pajamas? The product doesn't look anything like the picture. The material feels like a children's Halloween costume.
1.0,"Cheap, but cute. Broke before the Halloween party was over, and we left early!"
1.0,"The thing was smelly, and I started itching the moment I put it on. Garbage."
1.0,material is to cheap
1.0,My XL bra barely covered half of my chest. I threw this away--it suckkkkkkkkd.
1.0,Returned it. Doesn't look like picture. Not good quality. Also runs small.
1.0,The socks got holes right after wearing it once. Poor quality. Don't purchase.
1.0,Not a great fit and fabric is uncommonly uncomfortable!
1.0,Broke in less then 2 weeks
1.0,"Took forever to get this, and it was poor quality. The icon was super stiff and it smelled like plastic"
1.0,"I‚Äôve had them for less than 2 months and this has happened.  Very upset, feel like I wasted my money!!"
1.0,Broke easily during my clinical rotation.
1.0,I bought it for my nephew and it broke the same day. Cheap
1.0,"I loved the leggings, the fit, and they looked good on me, but the seam split on the side only a couple hours into wearing them. Super bummed they are so poorly constructed. Definitely not worth the 2 hours of wear you get out of them."
1.0,"Honestly, it is a beautiful bracelet, but the gemstones are not properly secured, the person I gave it to for a gift on the first day of wearing it, in less than three hours it was already missing a stone.  Rather embarrassing for the gift giver (me) and then for the receiver to have to tell me that happened."
1.0,"Shirt is too small. I wear a size L, I ordered a xl just in case. The shirt received looks like a size small.  Waste of money!"
1.0,"They shredding all over the house, it‚Äôs terrible!!!!"
1.0,"not happy with this item, it was to hard."
1.0,I purchased the Thermal Gloves and Thermal Socks.  Neither of these kept my hands or feet warmer than any other non-insulated glove or sock.  I wouldn't spend the extra money on these.
1.0,"It just didn‚Äôt look as rich in person as it does on model, I feel like it‚Äôs about the same dress"
1.0,"I thought they were all push tops and not screw in and unfortunately, they were extremely difficult to unscrew.  Hence, I returned these."
1.0,Too big and heavy. Falls off my uniform.
1.0,This is such a beautiful shirt.... if it came out right. Tooo small and I got a xl!! It fits my 10 year old sister and I'm 25. Definitely need to change the chart size to kids only. Or change the measurements to fit an adult.  Material was super thin. And shirt wasn't exactl white. More like creme.
1.0,First it doesnt come with battery. Plus the dial screen is totally different then it was described
1.0,They broke 1 day after return window closed.
1.0,I just got these in the mail ansbauper confused and one some of the pairs have this random price coming out?
1.0,"Unless you are over 5'7&#34; and stick thin like the model, the dress looks like a silk sack.  Too bad, the fabric is wonderful."
1.0,Crystal came out of one earring atready.
1.0,"Bought for my son.  Of course they're made in China, of course they're cheap - did it have to rip in 24 hours?"
1.0,"These are terrible, not what I was looking for at all. They're extremely thin, thinner than most leggings even, and see through in some places. They were also really long but if you're close to six feet tall they might work for you."
1.0,"CHEAP AND WORTHLESS, DESCRIPTION IS NOT ACCURATE, FLIMSY HAT"
1.0,I‚Äôve ordered this brand nightgown before and loved the softness and comfort. I can‚Äôt believe this is one of their products. The material is stiff and scratchy.<br />I sent it back.
1.0,Loved how these looked in the picture. Read the reviews and got a size larger. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 135 lbs. I bought a large which was supposed to be a 12-14. I wear an 8. They were two sizes to small. More like a 4-6. They were also about 4 inches to long. Sent them back.
1.0,"My daughter has had this thing for about a week & it is already falling apart ""pissed""<br />I wouldn't be pissed if it was $5 but it wasn't so freaking pissed"
1.0,Had to return order..
1.0,"I run everyday and loved the price of these-but that‚Äôs about it. Here‚Äôs 2 reasons why I‚Äôd pass on these...<br />1. They have the removable pads that bunch up when you wash them and are a pain to adjust through the little holes.<br /><br />2. Even after multiple washes, they‚Äôre still bleeding. Here is a picture after today‚Äôs run (and before you ask- yes- I‚Äôll still wear them when I‚Äôm running low on laundry."
1.0,House slippers
1.0,"Wish I could give 0 stars. If you have big boobs, forget it."
1.0,Colors are pretty similar to the o8cs but the sizing is a joke! Its 2 sizes smaller than what the tag says so be mindful of that.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:25e7bbcb735a5614ba6fd603f1728614]] It was too big, only for curvy people, if you are thin like me, these will not fit"
1.0,"Loved them at first. She wears them to hip hop, doesn't spend a lot of time in them, and one shoe already quit working. So disappointed because they are adorable. She only gets one or two classes out of a charge too."
1.0,I can fit a small in both tops and bottoms and this was absolutely TINY on me. It was also very tight and uncomfortable. Plus it looked very awkward on my body type. Don‚Äôt recommend.
1.0,Did not like that the nose was open. Will not use but failed to return in time
1.0,They were way too big. Amazon refunded my purchase
1.0,No where near true to size . All 2x are baggy on me and this one I cannot get past my breast . It does not stretch either .
1.0,The top is extremely tiny the arm holes are so tight on my daughter. The bottoms fit true to size ‚Ä¶unfortunately the top is totally unusable
1.0,They did not fit any where close to size.
1.0,This product broke the third day I wore it.
1.0,"The necklace came with the chain attached to itself and the clasp attached like a pentant (unable to open at all). I'm literally unable to wear this necklace. I'm sure if I get it fixed it'd be great, but I haven't gotten the chance."
1.0,"So..., The jacket is ok, but a little tight for someone with a 42"" chest.  You may want to use a little boob tape to hold the front closed.  The bigger problem, are the pants.  While the are elf length, the are also somehow able to focus the attention of others, directly at my nethers.  This made using the pants useless, unless for a ladies night party.  Also, the hat was made for someone with child size cranial cap and was not long enough to cover my ears.  The only completely useful item were the covers.  They looked ok and did not distract for the costume.  My recommendation is to spend your money on a nice coat and pair of knickers."
1.0,"This was a disaster. Poor finishing, poor fabric quality. Returned"
1.0,"Item arrived completely destroyed. The item was shipped with zero protective material, literally a cheap box in a plastic bag. The screen was so damaged it was unreadable. I've requested a return only to discover I have to pay for the return shipping... seriously? As if the damage was my fault."
1.0,The lace was not attached straight to the hat. Very cheap!
1.0,Material malo
1.0,Will bleed on blue on clothes and sheets.
1.0,Very poor quality.  0 Star really but don‚Äôt get that choice
1.0,"I love this belt. I somewhat assumed it must be adjustable when I ordered it, as there was no size mentioned on the the description. When I received it, there was a tag with a size large marked on it. I‚Äôm very small in my waist. I‚Äôm returning the belt but would love to have it in a size SMALL if any way possible. Thank you."
1.0,"Even though it is beautiful, but it turns green in my ears. So not healthy in the long term."
1.0,The belt was nice but as soon as my husband try to put it on it broke
1.0,Too short bottoms tight not a true plus size fit
1.0,"Not &#34;tall&#34; at all. These are just regular A-shirts, they may have &#34;tall&#34; stamped on them, but I could not even tuck them in."
1.0,Is definitely not as &#34;classy&#34; looking as the picture provided.
1.0,Only received one of the two hats although I got charged for the &#34;pair&#34;. I would like a refund.
1.0,Starting to tear at top of bag with just light use with light objects placed in it
1.0,Tight fit. Chain is not good quality. Broke after 3 days.
1.0,"I bought this lion onesie as a gift for my son's girlfriend, and we did a FaceTime video chat so I could see her wearing it. She put it on...and I was embarrassed: the front bottom had a huge ""crotch pouch"" that happened, and it wouldn't go away. The crotch of the pajama bulged out in embarrassing fashion. But she dismissed it, and then commented on the convenience of a ""butt zipper,"" and tried to show me how great a feature it was (she was fully clothed underneath).<br /><br />Another embarrassment occurred: the zipper jammed completely, then went off the tracks altogether. I watched her carefully try to unzip it, and the disaster happened in spite of her care. This was a bad purchase, but she doesn't want to return it. I'm going to try and convince her because I'm ashamed I bought it. Buyer: beware."
1.0,"Do not waste your money I ordered the 17in. chain is short lightweight cheaply made. The chain itself should be 17 in, even with both clasp on the ends it barely reaches 16 in."
1.0,Want to return. The crochet literally ripped in three different places while I was wearing it. Not worth buying
1.0,"Shorts did not fit and the time had expired for me to return. I'm so dad because I was really looking forward to them. For my big girls with thick thighs, do not buy."
1.0,would not stay hooked to watch. clasps do not fit properly
1.0,Fell apart within 2 or 3 daysüëé
1.0,Was an xlarge and was way to small and I normally<br />Where a large
1.0,This is so tiny. Not what we had expected or hoped for
1.0,To small an handle is not good
1.0,I ordered this in 18g. Too large and would not go through. Held it up against my other 18g rings and they could fit inside this. Shame because I loved the look.
1.0,"The product I received was obviously used. It had no tags, had hair on it and smelled so bad (a mix of body odor and essential oils). Someone had obviously worn it multiple times and returned it. While that is not the company‚Äôs fault, they did send it out again. That is something that should be checked. So the low stars is more the quality of the company than the jacket itself. The jacket itself seems well made and the color seems pretty true to what I saw on my screen. I would have kept it if it were new. I won‚Äôt buy another though as I don‚Äôt believe the jacket‚Äôs quality to be a $40 jacket. I bought it for $25 on a lightning deal and I feel like that is a fair price."
1.0,These started coming apart after the first wash. Several pairs started tearing at the seams within the first couple wears.
1.0,I will be returning this bag because the smell of it is horrible. It is also very flimsy and doesn't hold its shape. Looks great in the picture - I wish the bag in the picture was more representative of the product.
1.0,"Huge disappointment;  opened each shirt, happy to feel how soft they were.  Unfolded them to find they were covered with slits in the fabric.  When I called to return them I requested the replacements be inspected before shipping.  Was assured they would be.  They weren‚Äôt,  were as damaged as the first ones.  Am not ordering a third time, being refunded.  Sad."
1.0,"Found it awkward to use. Personally, would not buy again."
1.0,These were broken when I received them so I could not enjoy them at my company ugly sweater christmas party. Returning them for a refund.
1.0,Every single one of these ripped and tore the second I put them on. They are the biggest waste of money!!!!
1.0,"Boy, what a disappointment! I understand these are inexpensive, but that doesn't mean they should last less than two months. I essentially only wear this watch to work and gets little to no abuse. About two days ago, I noticed two cracks forming on either side of the top strap hinge and knew it was a matter of time before the strap would come off altogether. Well, here we are. I also wore this watch into a hot tub for no more than 15min and there was condesantion on my screen for a few days afterwards, so water resistance also leaves a lot to be desired. Overall, I'm bummed because I really liked the watch and how light, simple and easy it was to use. Now I'm on the hunt for another inexpensive watch that will hopefully last more than 2 months."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this shirt for Halloween only to be severely disappointed. I usually wear LARGE and I wanted a loose fit so I ordered XL. Holding the shirt up, It didn't seem like an XL. So I would say it runs small. And they don't have the next size up in stock, however that is not the only reason I am returning the shirt. The purple color that it pictured is not the color purple that I received."
1.0,I asked in the questions section and the seller replied that they fit.  So I purchased them just to find out that they DO NOT FIT!  I want my money back.  Stay away from this scam product.
1.0,Loved this phone my iPhone 7 fits perfectly
1.0,"Very cheaply made, the red part fell off before I even wore them"
1.0,It came smashed and stuffed in my mailbox. Also super cheap looking. I should have read the reviews before buying.  Returning.
1.0,cheap fabric and would need an additional skirt under it. Fits very large for size and I returned
1.0,Hat great quality but I only received the hat. Will return‚Ä¶.
1.0,"They sent me a pink dress when I ordered it in black. And now I don‚Äôt have time to order another one before I go on vacation. :(<br /><br />I‚Äôm wearing a size large in this dress. Normally wear a medium. I am about 5‚Äô2 150lbs<br /><br />The neckline doesn‚Äôt have much stretch, so it‚Äôs pretty conservative up top. The material is very thin, so it‚Äôs pretty revealing on the bottom.<br /><br />I would have gave this more stars, but what am I supposed to do with a pink dress on my Halloween vacation?"
1.0,They sent me to left shoes üò© and their super cute but useless I have to order again ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1.0,Very cheap looking clothes
1.0,I had to attach the gem to the gauge. I also had to replace the ring cause it was cheaply made.
1.0,Snapped in half in about 30 seconds. I picked them up after opening them and they pretty much crumbled. Very cheap quality but could expect that since the price was cheap.
1.0,"do not buy it, wish i could still return"
1.0,"This certainly isn't a sweatshirt. It is some sort of cheap polyester like material. I ordered a medium. They said sizes were accurate, however this medium is HUGE. There is not 1 single tag on it! None. No size, no washing instructions. I can't argue tbe size because There is no size tag. They don't know what they shipped and I don't know what size I received. To sum it up, I would stay away from anything Farsays has to offer. I know I will."
1.0,Pretty but very big and heavy.
1.0,Returning. Purchased XL and they look like child's XL.
1.0,Prttty disappointed ... these look nothing like the picture and are even good fakes. I would not recommend these if your looking for anything that looks like a stone.
1.0,"Very cheap looking but not lightweight, I'll give them that. However, what I don't like is that they are completely flat. There is no curve at all to contour to the face as in typical sunglasses. I returned them without even wearing them."
1.0,"This is by far the worst purchase that I every bought. Both shoes weren‚Äôt even glued together. Sad very sad that they can‚Äôt take enough time to make sure that their products are made right. Don‚Äôt waste your money or time . Big Mistake, never again"
1.0,"I would not recommend this particular necklace to anyone.<br />It looked nice and my son really like it, but there were issues with the clasp.<br />Yes, it was cheap. That doesn't matter if you can't use it.<br />Within an hour, the clasp blew apart.<br />My son was outside and we could not find the lost part to even attempt to glue it together."
1.0,"The material is somewhat cheap.  There hem was not neatly finished. Although I liked the length of the dress, it did not look elegant on me. I returned this product."

1.0,I'm a lg/xl so I ordered a xxxl which DID NOT FIT I'm bigger in the chest and ended up giving it to my gf
1.0,"Snaps are cheap, hard to open and come apart easily. Ordered 2, this one I sent one back for a refund when snaps broke when shirt was unsnapped to try on."
1.0,Would not recommend any of their shoe‚Äôs . I tried to cancel before they were shipped and they would not cancel them and can‚Äôt send back. I received today and they aren‚Äôt true in size. They are smaller in what I wear. The strap‚Äôs barely wrap around my heal.  These came from China.
1.0,"Terrible size, terrible design, terrible materials. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody, there's nothing good about it, I never even used it cause its disappointing."
1.0,this is not the Marine Corps logo
1.0,"Strap broke during first use, inside bunched up so much I couldn't even get my fingers in the gloves. Returned for a refund."
1.0,Please do not purchase this necklace! The chain is very flimsy and dull. The stones have zero sparkle or shine! I've never spent $72 on such a disappointing piece of costume jewelry. It tangles every time you wear it. You can get nicer pieces at Target or Wamart. This tangled mess is in the trash after spending 90 minutes trying to untangle it. I only wore it twice. Please do not waste your money on this inferior junk!!!
1.0,Sized for pygmies.  Problem with Chinese merchandise.  Made for very small people
1.0,Material was cheap. Didnt like the quality
1.0,The sewing was all over the place..  the center tie straps are so off it‚Äôs embarrassing. I trashed it as soon as I tried it on. Possibly my worst Amazon purchase ever. Save your money.

1.0,Ordered the smallest size and it was too big and frumpy on me. Had to return.
1.0,I had to return them because they were too thin to use for even a burp cloth.  They did arrive quickly and in a nice plastic pouch.
1.0,"I bought these pants along with others and none of them fit my son. I ordered a size 30 and length 34, and I received a size boys 12 and length 28. Never again will I order something like this online I‚Äôll continue to go to the department stores or order online from companies within the states."
1.0,This shirt runs verrrrrrry small.
1.0,Does not look like picture writing on the side is supposed to say mustang but looks like waves horse looks like it's got problems it was a waste of money
1.0,It broke after wearing it only 3 times.
1.0,Chain is flimsy and it broke as as soon as she put it on. had to return and get a refund. She didn't even get a chance to wear it.

1.0,"I would have given this bag 4 stars except for two problems.  One the colored strap has a portion that the color is messed up on, really faded.  Two, there are some brown discoloration spots one side that do not wash off."
1.0,Description says waterproof but when you receive e the pants it says water ‚Äúresistant‚Äù which not the same at all. They also list them as down;  two things one if they are down there has to be a very tiny amount put in them and two I don‚Äôt think they are down at all (that part of course is just my opinion). I would not recommend
1.0,The body chain came broken. I needed it for tomorrow.
1.0,"My apron was way too small!  I truly believe they are made for very slender people... go larger... maybe even 2 sizes... I would!  My apron was VERY small and could not completely wrap around... I am usually a medium (American, if that helps)"
1.0,I normally would wear medium sized shirts.  I ordered a small because these shirts looked like they were cut generously. It was humongous!!! The shirts are very long and VERY loose fitting above the cinched area. I loved the way it looked from the bust and up. Everything else fit very odd.
1.0,Disappointed that the Velcro isn‚Äôt stitched to the band.  The Velcro comes off and the band is useless.  Just returned the. And bought the real Apple band.  Yeah they are $50 but they last.
1.0,Don't know why I bought this. Cheap cheaper cheapest.
1.0,They don‚Äôt stay up when I bend over. Waste of money. I have big thighs & a booty so I was hoping these wouldn‚Äôt ride down wit movement

1.0,"Too big, maybe I should have ordered 2 sizes down! Returned it!"
1.0,"As soon as I washed it, all of the buttons fell off and got lost in the washer/dryer. Reviews said size up because the arms ran right but they're baggy on me."
1.0,They weren't 100% cotton. Got a refund.
1.0,"The blouse does not look like the picture; the fabric is of a very thin and cheap quality and the sewing was  poorly done.  The gathering around the waist area was uneven and the elastic is area is very loose.  The shade of orange in the picture is  tanish  orange, the one I received is loud orange I am disappointed."
1.0,It didn‚Äôt come with any instructions on how to clean or how to use.
1.0,"I wear a size 8 shoe, and these socks do not fit tightly enough to allow me to wear them during the yoga poses that require traction, for example down dog, or the warrior or triangle series. They start sliding off or around my foot so that the sticky party's are no longer where I need them to be, and I end up removing them. They may be fine for walking around the house and not slipping on floors, but they did not work well for yoga."
1.0,"It is not what you imagine comparing to the photos of the dress online.<br /><br />This dress was bought for a wedding of a friend that I really love. Us (the bridesmaids), we live in different states and it was very difficult for us to buy the bridesmaids dress together. We thought that it was a good idea to buy it on Amazon.<br /><br />FIRST OF ALL, the dress is very large. I followed the measurement chart that appeared by the brand but when I had it on it was bad. A part that it is horrible, the top is really vuloptuos, the breats cups are poorly placed and are really CHEAP. NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTOS.<br /><br />Do not buy this. The dress is CHEAP. It‚Äôs not wort $90.00. This dress is worth $20 max. The customer service was fast and the refund too. But we had to actually buy the bridesmaids dress in a store and try it on first before buying it."
1.0,"Bought this for my granddaughters 16th bday.  Not at all the correct color.  Suppose to be a beautiful blue, received a grey instead.  Disappointed!"
1.0,"The photo shows that the sides are a bit shorter, however I ordered a size up (bc made in China things like this tend to run small) and the sides went all the way up to my bra while the front and back went almost down to my knees."
1.0,The cris cross straps in front are very awkward and loose. I would no recommend :(
1.0,"poor fit it is made for a 7 year old child!  the vendor did refund a small partial payment after telling me I should sell it to a friend!  it was cut completely wrong, which is why it does not fit.  so it is defective!"
1.0,"I ordered these because I have a very small nose and most hoops are too large in diameter to fit. Unfortunately they are 3-5 millimeters too small in diameter, and not only that, but I have an 18 gauge piercing and the rings I recieved have to be 12 gauge. The quality of the rings themselves seem good, although I haven't been able to wear them to find out for sure. If you have a (small child) sized nose or a very low nasal or septum piercing, this would be great."
1.0,They are the worst sock I Ever bought<br /> The inside are full of strings and very hard to put on
1.0,The package arrived today as expected although on the back of the vest there‚Äôs no belt to tighten. I‚Äôm not sure if the wrong vest was sent to me or if my item is defective but I have to return it now.
1.0,I previously said good product but this turned my ears green don‚Äôt recommend
1.0,"Unfortunately the padding in these shorts fall short on providing comfort.  Very thin compared to others purchased on Amazon, these will go back."
1.0,They don‚Äôt stick!! I put them on and pulled it up rubbed it down and nothing the sticky part don‚Äôt stick at all these are useless to me!! Garbage!! Don‚Äôt waste your money!!!
1.0,The glasses frames I received were Guess & were green but they are not the ones in the picture. The ones I received have smaller lenses & are darker green....I kept them anyway & my 12 yr old likes them.
1.0,Order these for our flower girls and they are so cheap looking I gave them all to the neighborhood little girls.
1.0,"Wow, should of listen to the reviews! Would give 0 stars if I could! These are ridiculously tiny! I mean for a child maybe and the cubic zirconia you can't even see so small! Need magnifying glass! Lol<br />Looks nothing like the photo! Cannot recommend!"
1.0,Zipper doesn‚Äôt stay up
1.0,Very difficult to close dt the flaps that cushion the zipper at the top and bottom getting in the way.
1.0,Estoy muy molesta porque dice art√≠culo elegible para devoluci√≥n y resulta que no es asi.<br />No es la talla correcta
1.0,You can barely read the message on the bracelet which is the whole purpose of the &#34;message&#34; bracelet. To me they just look cheap.
1.0,Insultingly small. 3xl might as well be a large.
1.0,"These pants are incredibly expensive for not holding up. I'm bummed I paid for them as I need to throw them out now, a couple months after purchase."
1.0,"Not made very well,and the read is orangish in spots."
1.0,Update: These streched out on my face and slip off now. I probably used them 10 times over the last year and they've become too big.
1.0,Shoes are hard and uncomfortable very cheap.
1.0,Turned finger green 2 months later and the &#34;white gold&#34; tarnished off looks like crap now very displeased.
1.0,Very disappointed in this purchase. Received the wrong color. Didnt want to go through return hassle.
1.0,Fits more like a juniors top
1.0,"TERRIBLE quality product. Handled carefully yet they simply fell apart rapidly.<br />Replaced with a pair from Walmart for half the price, 10x as durable, and still going strong."
1.0,It was a nice quality of fabric but runs very small.
1.0,"The earrings were closed and I couldn‚Äôt close them because they had no hole, I‚Äôm so disappointed. Never again."
1.0,"Two separate pieces delivered, cut, dirty and incorrect. Not even a a full outfit. Just two pieces of scarves that are different colors. I would not recommend."
1.0,"HEAR ME OUT!! Very dissapointed and so bumbed.<br /><br />1. I ordered the dress 9/4/2019. Did not arrive until 9/13/2019 though it was in stock. Did get an email stating they were sorry for the delay but no reason as to why.<br /><br />2. I picked a very pretty olive green, floral print wrap dress. What I recieved was a light green and white polka dot wrap dress with very stiff fabric that felt awful.<br /><br />3. I read the numerous reviews. I sized up to accomodate my bust. I will say I am very well endowed,(42 DDD) but the cut would not even begin to cover. All open and gaping down to wear it would tie. I weigh 210 and wear a 14W or 16 pant and 1 or 2x shirt dress comfortably.<br /><br />Moral of the story- be careful if you are busty with this dress. I will say the fit around the waist was nice, material is NOT forgiving or stretchy. Length was at top of shin just below knee."
1.0,Nothing good about this product
1.0,"Rather ""Lack luster"", no sparkle at all and very cheap looking! sorry.."
1.0,Product didn‚Äôt fit... forgot to send it back now I am stuck with it

1.0,"I opened the package, and right away I knew that my plus size was NOT universal. lol I went up a size just to be sure and still fit me like it was my little nieces shirt. I did return it, which was very quick and easy thank goodness. I was very pretty though...sad I could not wear it."
1.0,I will be shipping it back.  It looks very nice on the images posted but in person it is cheap looking.  Grest for kids dress up games if that is what you are purchsing it for but to wear as an adult it looks too cheap.
1.0,I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù 108 lbs and not curvy. I usually wear a small but sized up to a medium because I figured they would run small. I couldn‚Äôt even get these over my tiny thighs! A large or even X-Large would probably not fit! They have no stretch at all and waistband is terrible! And the fleece is super thin. Do not recommend these to anyone! You get what you pay for and with the price I should have known they would be bad!
1.0,There were threads hanging from seams and buttons popping off just by buttoning them. I knew this was acrylic...but I didn't think it would be this bad of acrylic! I know how to sew - but if I buy a garment new I don't want to have to repair it before I can wear it.
1.0,It is not 100% Cotton and I don't like at all the plastic feeling this leaves on the skin of my son.<br />It s like a wet suit texture. Not Happy with this purchase.<br />I did not expect that the 5% would make that much of a difference.
1.0,Students doesn't screw into piercing...bad..not happy
1.0,It did not fit on anyone's wrist. Not even my 12 year old.

1.0,I received this product in the mail today for a gift and the bow has a small stain on it!!
1.0,I will have to remake the loop to accommodate the pearl.
1.0,There's no battery so I will be taking it to my jeweler and may be changing this review if it doesn't work.  But it is a little prettier than it appeared online.... I took it to jewelers to put battery  in it but it still didn't  work.
1.0,"The description touts these earrings as clip on. They are not, they are for pierced ears. I guess I should have examined the pictures more closely."
1.0,They have no elasticity they don‚Äôt stay up
1.0,Poor Quality. Not wool.
1.0,"This dress is cute but you can see the pads on the top, the fabric is see-threw."
1.0,Product broke in less than an hour of wearing them.
1.0,The dress received looked more like an empire wasted flower girl dress versus a formal for a full grown female.  It was cheaply made and of course it was sent back.  Don‚Äôt waste your time or money!
1.0,crappy product
1.0,I ordered using the provided sized chart and was incredibly disappointed in how small it was. It didn't even fit over my head/shoulders
1.0,"Very disappointed with this purchase, I got this dress as a present to myself for my birthday, one side of the dress is longer than the other and has blue pen ink by the button area. Awful‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt recommend it to anyone.. Not worth the price."
1.0,"This is a cute bag. I had it for two weeks before it broke. I used it for both a short trip and for work. The strap ripped right off, under the weight of about 15 lbs total - a laptop, a notebook, a book, some clothes.  I would take a hard pass on this unless you are packing lighter than 15 lbs."
1.0,"I was expecting a Tie dye graphic t shirt. When it arrived, it‚Äôs a stretchy weird material and the tie dye is printed on‚Ä¶ not actually dyed. Not a fan."
1.0,Tiny - not ‚Äúflowy hem‚Äù.  Will maybe work for my 11 year old granddaughter.  Shipping took forever. Wish I would‚Äôve cancelled and got my money back while I still could.
1.0,Update 12/31/2018. Second bracelet is Trash too! I had to tie a knot. I packaged up the first one and sent it back. I‚Äôm over this company and the junk.I My bracelet is falling apart after only wearing three times.
1.0,"This item looks NOTHING like the photo in person. It‚Äôs a terribly cheap spandex/polyester-like material that distorts the pattern with even the slightest bit of stretching. Fortunately, I was able to return for a full refund."
1.0,"These pants are terrible. They fit great, but very poor quality. I bought 3 different colors. The first pair I wore ended up getting a giant rip in the crotch that I didn't notice until the end of the day. I threw them away right away. I tried another of my new pairs the next day and they got a rip in the calf area just about 10 min of wearing them. Not recommended!"

1.0,Flimsy Material. Very dissappointed in this. The split at the back is way too high!
1.0,Fabric is cheap. See through. Poorly designed and equally a poorly sewn garment. The hem was uneven and not as photographed. Last time I by any garment on Amazon. Too many vendors no supervision for what is being sold. Very sad.

1.0,i wear a extra large and they are like a medium they run very small i will give credit to they are really cute just not my size
1.0,"These earring are beautiful, they are very nice in the silver which is what I purchased. I have three separate pairs in different sizes. Every pair fall out of my ears VERY EASILY at the clasp is VERY, very loose fitting‚Ä¶ sad!!!"
1.0,I bought this for my mother  and This is absolutely  garbage. The fabric is like  paper. Don't  waste your money.
1.0,Not quality material. long and thin. some fell apart and sparkly glitter everywhere. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Not an off shoulder sweater.  The shoulder arm seams are just pulled down to sides.

1.0,Material is clingy and doesn‚Äôt have great shape.
1.0,Absolutely large. But cute and VERY WARM.
1.0,Looks better on the model than it did in person. Was like wearing sack and moomoo all in one. Not good at all.
1.0,"Horrible, scratchy material, sizing was off(waist too big) bc of the way they are made.  Hard to explain...wish I could be more helpful but I would steer clear of these if your like me...you like soft materials & pants that fit normally in the waist(no draw string either)"
1.0,Definitely won‚Äôt be purchasing again.
1.0,No don't pay this price! The time set you can't  see in the day time or night without a light. I was very dissatisfied with this buy. This one is third one in the military watches I have bought like the color the band feel like cheap plactic. I wish I never wasted my money on this one. Sorry Topcabin for this.
1.0,"glasses do not fit, made for kids glasses, not happy"
1.0,To short for full figure person
1.0,"I bought the basket pictured: with elegant, stitched leather handles. The basket I received after weeks of waiting had completely different handles: narrow, raw leather, different thicknesses on one side versus the other, plus four handles, not two. The woven part is fine but this is not the style that is advertised. I have returned it."
1.0,Very cheaply made and it took 2 weeks to get to me even though it was promised in four
1.0,Looks like a pretty necklace - but the clasp is impossible to open. I still have been unable to wear it.

1.0,I ordered my usual size S. It was too big in the waist; overall poor quality/cheap looking :(
1.0,This belt doesn't stay ratcheted and you have to constantly keep tightening. Extremely poor design. A belt that doesn't stay tightened is worthless since it can't do the ONE job it's supposed to do. Don't waste your money on this belt...
1.0,Very bad quality.  Ripped right away
1.0,Too damn little.
1.0,I returned these the very next day after I received them. My husband simply ran his knife across it and cut through BOTH sides of the glove! As a chef Ithat's constantly writing with sharp instruments I can't take a chance like that
1.0,"Ordered size large. Could barely pull them on. I'm a normal sized 5' 10"" guy. Their sizing guidelines do not work. Good gloves for kids I guess."
1.0,The size is horrible. I gave them to my 12 year old neighbor! I am very disappointed!!!!!
1.0,"This skirt came relatively quickly although definitely not prime fast. It looks like the photo but smells like chemicals and oil like you wouldn't believe. I hung it up to air out and the whole apartment stank. I hid it in my closet and all the clothes next to it smell like it. I'm going to try to soak it in hot water and then wash it for a thousand cycles and maybe it will be useable, but I anticipate I'll end up throwing it out as I'm not sure this level of sulfur from hell smell could ever wash out. If you don't have a nose, it's cute though."
1.0,I requested return. They said they don't accept return. Dont waste your money. Quality is so bad. People will laugh if you wear it.
1.0,It‚Äôs cheap and a medium hangs on me (130 lbs and 5‚Äô6‚Äù) but still doesn‚Äôt cover my butt.  If you weigh over 140 and are under 5‚Äô2... you might like it.  Nothing like the picture
1.0,Don‚Äôt waste your money . Super cheap material . Nothing too it . Way too big as well
1.0,Your product wouldn‚Äôt fit a Barbie doll
1.0,"Came pretty fast, material seemed to be nice and thick and long lasting, was bought for my 10 year old as a reward for keeping up on chores during this crazy time with no schooling.. First the letter i is missing from the warriors, and it‚Äôs pretty noticeable, and within a few days all the letters are peeling off on the front and back, haven‚Äôt even washed it yet, my son is very upset, he still loves the jersey lol, I‚Äôm not impressed!!! Would return but he loves it too much, I will just have to spend the extra money and get something else."

1.0,"No stretch in top as others said it had.<br />It's cute, but cheaply made. Returning."
1.0,Love the decal but it is very tight across the chest but has out of the ordinary large arm holes. Impossible to wear.
1.0,i returned this item.  looks very good on the photo; material is very poor in quality.  do not waste your money.
1.0,"The fabric is extremely low quality. I thought at first someone had tried it on while wearing deodorant and left white splotches along the side, but it's just the way the fabric looks when worn outside. The shape and style are cute, the cheapness is just unfortunately really palpable.<br /><br />It also came as a lighter shade of blue than the dark blue that was advertised. Overall just a questionable product."
1.0,"The  onesie was really poor quality and had a blue tinge to the fabric. It reeked like diesel fuel. Even after washing the onesie, it still smelled. I was afraid to even put it on my LO because of the odd smell. The bow on the headband was hanging on by a single thread. The neck area of the onesie was huge. I would NOT recommend this to anyone!"
1.0,"If you want the standard Garmin quick release band.  Don't buy these, they dont have it.  Keep scrolling üëç"
1.0,I purchased this as a gift and it did NOT keep my friend's gold Rolex watch (men's) wound.  I returned the item and exchanged it for a new one thinking the original may have been defective. The second one worked no better than the first. I then tried it with a lighter women's gold Rolex and it did not work for that either.  I would NOT recommend this product.
1.0,i don't know how i will ever afford this.
1.0,"When I received this it was already broken in a way that I couldn't even put it on my watch, but that wouldn't have mattered anyway because it's still too small for my wrist. I will say if you have small wrists, it is cute. Looks just like the photo."
1.0,"The ribbon on this bracelet is red, not pink! It is described as pink in the product details!"
1.0,"Mask is huge, if you push it up to cover your face correctly you can no longer see the design or read the words. It fits and feels awkward."
1.0,Was skeptical about it. And i was right. I got it all dent and believe theres no way to get it straight! Was for a gift but nevermind
1.0,"Return item, it looked like a fake and one of those 3 d glasses at a movie theater"
1.0,"The shoes are comfortable but the structure of the shoes does not provide support for the sidewalls.  They are constantly trying to rollover and your feet are trying to slide off the soles.  At a cost of $49, I expected much higher quality construction. When I replace them, they will quickly find a new home in my trash can.  Bad purchase!"
1.0,"the 1st pair i ordered arrived quickly, but one of the shoes was ripped across the top side.  did a return and replacement pair arrived quickly.  the second time he put them on the shoe split exactly in the same spot just like the 1st pair was."
1.0,The sweater is fake and I was embarrassed when my son saw it.  It took forever for it to arrive and had a HOORIBLE chemical smell.  To add insult to injury it was missing a letter!! How do I get my month back for this fraud of a hoodie..
1.0,fits too large horrible quality
1.0,I could see all the way through the shirt. VERY EXTREMELY THIN.
1.0,I didn't like this item. So small it couldn't fix my 4 year Grand child
1.0,"Wanted to love this necklace, but the teardrop pendant arrived with the rose gold plate completely worn/chipped off. Don't know if I was sent someone else's return, or the retailer has quality control issues. Either way, it reinforces my reluctance to buy inexpensive jewelry.  Have already returned it."
1.0,"Amazon should pull this off there site , waste of money! Read the reviews !!!!!"
1.0,started falling apart at the seams after the first wash.
1.0,Blue die wore off in a month and is now white...
1.0,The band is beautiful but broke after two wears. I‚Äôm terribly upset because it was my favorite
1.0,Did not fit well. Too tight and short.
1.0,"The material is very thick and lined as if for cold weather. There is no way it could be worn in spring or summer. It is also unflattering and does not look like the picture or fit the description. I will be returning, very disappointed."
1.0,The glasses are very cheaply made!<br />Didn‚Äôt do much for me in the sun...<br />Waste of money
1.0,"Love the style and the fit, still have and wear my black pair from two years ago, but went through two green ones in a few months. The teeth literally just fall out like the shorts have some extreme case of tooth decay. The second pair I zipped up very slowly and carefully because I loved everything else about the shorts, but once more at work the teeth fell out and I had to spend a bit too long in the restroom fixing the zipper so it would at least stay closed to the end of the shift...not a fun situation when you work with the public with out something to stand behind."
1.0,The product description claims 100% UV protection.  I work with UV light and so as soon as they came I checked them.  They have 0% UV protection.  It is very dangerous to make such a faulty claim.  Returned immediately.
1.0,BE WARNED!!!! NO RETURNS....
1.0,"In order these earrings thinking I was getting silver gold and rose gold instead I got silver and gold only, the whole purpose was getting one of each, not happy!!!"
1.0,These are cute but not kid size. These did not fit my six or ten year old they were way to big.
1.0,Both earrings are cut the same so one is inside out when you try to wear them.
1.0,I give it a zero!!! do not waste your money!!! made entirely wrong!!!!
1.0,Crotch ripped after 1 weekend wearing as work pants. Garbage.
1.0,Even when my arms are not big they were falling all the time
1.0,Made my daughter finger turn green
1.0,"Way, way too small for an adult woman."
1.0,"I used it once and they were completely dark, they are beautiful but have no quality at allüòê"
1.0,This product is not as listed. The masks are too large for children and hang off the chin.
1.0,"received this item and I only got 10 not 40...half of lights did not work, I would not recommend this item"
1.0,Uncomfortable and strange to fit
1.0,Don‚Äôt bug this item it‚Äôs not as advertised. I was given thx run around to return and the return windows closed.
1.0,Like the socks but they came with a cut in them.  I can't wear them.
1.0,"My husband begged me to order a pair for him after a TV advertisement,reluctant I did. Received them today and I put one pair on to look at the back yard but was not able to focus on any thing, a beautiful red cardinal sitting on the fence looked like a red fuzzy ball.There was no packing slip or any paper in the package that stated the amount of the purchase, or a way to return it. I got a little suspicious and checked with the credit card company to enquire about the charge for that transaction and I got the shock: $88.80 instead of $25.90.Tried to contact Apg Zoomies to no avail so I called back the credit card company, reported the episode and cancelled the card. Sure do no trust those people. Big scam."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this but all of that joy disappeared when I received the package. The only reason I even opened the plastic was to make sure I wasn't seeing things. This item is NOT satin, it's cotton, like a tshirt which totally defeated the purpose of my purchase. I don't have a picture to share because I returned it the same day I got it and have no intentions on purchasing another from this company as it's not as described."
1.0,Sadly this is not at all what I had expected. The color looks nothing at all like advertised and it feels a bit cheap. I‚Äôm returning it sadly but if the color had been right I would have just kept it.
1.0,"They say they‚Äôre comfortable, thick and padded and it‚Äôsa bag lie.<br />I got my order today and it‚Äôs the most horrible material and quality I have ever seen. I‚Äôm returning them. It‚Äôs so frustrating trusting the description they give about the items they sell and they make money with items that are not worth. The fabric is super thin, the soles are not padded and don‚Äôt have the anti slippery foam soles"
1.0,I had to saw the arms since there wasn't even a inch sawn. Her little chest was showing so I had to add a ribbon to help hold it up.
1.0,I would give zero stars if I could. This strap is NOT as described. It is not blue its purple! Very unhappy and returned it immediately.
1.0,it  broke
1.0,"There is nothing worse than a bra that rides up and these did just that.  In addition they make me itch.  They are pretty bra's and the cup fits well, when they are where they are supposed to be.  But unfortunately it was a waste of money for me."
1.0,This was cheap plastic and didn't look like the pictures.  I sent it back.
1.0,I was not happy. It was not what I expect it. Not happy at all. Way to small. Never again. The earrings look bigger in the picture.
1.0,Child size leggings!
1.0,This mask is a joke . It‚Äôs made of cardboard for the design and is very heavy and non breathable and does not light up . You can not return it so don‚Äôt waste your money on this useless mask ...
1.0,"Nice lenses, except for the fact that fell out of the frame not even two months in."
1.0,"If you are a skinny woman, this will not work. It is huge."
1.0,"Runs large, cute top but not for me"
1.0,cheap. broke too soon
1.0,"I have a 8 month old that in the course of crawling around a bit the first time he wore them, ripped the lace and scuffed the hell out of them to the point they are unwearable. I wouldn't recommend these for any baby that is actually mobile, they will not last. One time wear, not very impressive."
1.0,Not strong at all. Just putting them on they tear and are super thin. My nails are short but still manage to puncture them when I go to grab anything while wearing these gloves. Will not buy again.
1.0,Run small. Broke
1.0,"I bought this tank top, and when it FINALLY was delivered I put it on and it was a crop top on me. Returned."
1.0,Do not order if you want them within a certain time frame!
1.0,This dress is super sheer. You won‚Äôt be able to wear this without something under it. Paper thin and see through. I would not recommend. Total waste of money.
1.0,Don't fit my watch
1.0,These were not flattering on the body.
1.0,Terrible!!!! This is for a MENs sweater right? Because the first time I ordered it I got a women‚Äôs. I thought it was an innocent mistake so I did a return on the item and ordered it again. And today I opened my package to another women‚Äôs sweater. Idk what‚Äôs going on but you need to get this figured out.
1.0,would not recommend. very poor cheap quality. see through top and bottom. top was like a peice of fabric cut from a fabric roll used as a 'TOP' very poor. and plain.
1.0,"The metal fastener holding the pieces together came apart as my daughter was unclasping them to put them on her watch.  In the package, they come joined together by the ball of the clasp through the notch.  All she did was separate them and the metal mechanism completely came off!  I'm returning this!  Don't spend your money on this item."
1.0,"What the hell is this you guys sent me ? Because it certainly isn't what's pictured. What I got sent was a trash bag . I should have known when it said &#34;one size fits all&#34; this blouse would have been a no go . This top is not cropped at all . Way too big and long . I'm  5'7 , I'm not tall and I'm not short . So this top should have fit normal on me . I was expecting a top similar to the one sold by Zara, but i didn't want to pay 50-60 bucks for it . Seems like I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and buy it from Zara , because it's clear you get what you pay for ."
1.0,"One of the worst Amazon purchases I‚Äôve ever made. I love Amazon and order at least once a week on here. I‚Äôve never been this disappointed with an item.<br /><br />It arrived literally balled-up in a bag. There were several  loose threads hanging from the dress. And then I discovered the tag was stuck in the zipper. I can‚Äôt believe this package was shipped like this! üò§<br /><br />Despite all of this, I still tried it on. It was very loose and just not flattering on me. I ordered a large because that‚Äôs what the chart recommended. Not satisfied with this purchase at all."
1.0,"I should have read the reviews before I bought this shirt. It‚Äôs not like the picture. Cheap fabric, parts of the shirt weren‚Äôt even colored at all. Just bad"
1.0,Very disappointed in north face. Inside layer is only a 1/4 of the hat.
1.0,"Very low quality. You seem to get what you pay for with this band. Sharp edges, uncomfortable to wear in my opinion. Had a hard time making the curved ends fit. Never did get it right. Would never buy again."
1.0,Fit EXTREMELY small.  Ended up returning for a refund.
1.0,"It is much larger than expected, mostly clear resin with tiny flecks of stone. Not at all like photos."
1.0,I'm very disappointed in this order. The pants is poorly made and extremely short in length. The material is also very see-through and cheap
1.0,"So many things wrong. 1st, I ordered a xs and on package it says it is supposed to be a xs and it's not. It is a small. 2, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Super cheap look, feel and obviously made very poor!"
1.0,The goggles are comfortable but it is impossible to get them tight enough on my daughters head to keep the water out of her eyes.  Disappointed these didn‚Äôt work
1.0,"I did not receive a tank dress, it was a short sleeve dress. Not what I wanted but I packed it for a vacation and had to wear it as I didn't bring extra!"
1.0,broke when I received it
1.0,It is Sooo small in everything! the length of the arms is to small the dress length and it's so tight I'm 5'2 100 pounds and it was too short I ordered a small!!
1.0,Misleading false advertisement
1.0,"Horrible! Not the same material, size, shape, or color! Do not order from these people!!!"
1.0,It‚Äôs not a compression fit as anticipated and the colors are more gray less black
1.0,"Do not like this set at all.  I bought it for a recent trip.  Should have left it home and returned because it was a problem for the whole trip!  No handle on bottom for lifting. No expansion zippers (it appears to have one on small case, but it is only an opening for flat items.)  Outside zipper areas allow very little flat space for storage.  Could only fit a few pair of underwear or a thin pair of pj's in large outside pocket.  Wheels seem out of balance ~ or at least not cooperative much of the time.  I doubt they will allow me to return since it has been used, but very disappointed.  I will need to purchase new set for my next trip in November!!"
1.0,looks and feels great quality - but fits like a womens extra small.
1.0,trying to return item as it is too small. can't find a code to take to ups
1.0,Nice glasses but the colors are no where near the colors Display
1.0,The dress arrived with a stain on the arm and the seams were crooked and the bow was crooked. Very poor quality and craftsmanship. Strings still hanging from the very poor sewing job. The black trim that is sewn into the dress is crooked.  it goes in further in some areas and out further along the same line. This is consistent throughout the dress.
1.0,The worst purchase I ever had through Amazon.
1.0,"This button down shirt looks nothing like the photos. Its big, bulky, and all around just a terrible fit. The material is also dreadful and has a horrible texture. Not at all anything I will ever wear."
1.0,Cheap dress. Strap broken. If you have large chest do not buy !
1.0,This shirt looks good on the picture but doesn't look as good when I got it. The material is thin and seems to be of inferior quality. This is the downside of making online purchases of clothing.
1.0,"The watch face arrived broken, I requested an exchange but have yet to receive it."
1.0,The dress is very tight in the breadth. The length is fine. The fit. I am a 12 so it should be fine. THE SIZE of bust from front to back is the width of the bodice. IT is a size small or XS. VERY DIsappointing. i will never order other clothes from AMAZON. 90% it is a disappointment
1.0,This item is a waste of money.  It does not fit properly and it is not the same one that is advertised with the loop on it.  DO not waste your money it also crawls and does not stay in place.
1.0,"The wood ear piece snapped off within the month, leaving a sharp, jagged end.<br /><br />Too bad, as I liked them while they lasted"
1.0,Came so tangled I couldn't even use it
1.0,VERY BAD QUALITY! will unbuckle with the slightest of pulls.
1.0,First 3 photos need to be removed! It's not even the same shirt! I should have read reviews first or I would have never purchased this shirt. Super cheap looking & no real pocket!
1.0,It doesn‚Äôt look good in person
1.0,"Slim, but not sturdy. It arrived damage. Not recommended"
1.0,"Cute bra- but way too small, returned it"
1.0,DO NOT BUY AND WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!<br />Sizing was totally weird. I‚Äôm normally a large. I ordered an XL and I couldn‚Äôt even get them over my hips. Had a friend try them on who is much smaller and she said they were baggy in weird areas. Do not waste your time. Now I have to pay for shipping to return them.
1.0,I ordered one size up.  Should have gone up about four sizes.  Tiny.  Not designed for a chest and hips.  Liked the material.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"I love the color and fit, but the stitching is on the outside of the shirt!"
1.0,"Do not buy this watch...I purchased this watch on 9/5/17 and on 10/25/17 it stopped working<br />Directed to call a service number, I receive a BUSY signal at all times I attempt a call.<br />I guess poor quality does end up on Amazon as well as on the street corner for a &#34;quick sell&#34;"
1.0,Stone fell out and she lost the stone.ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1.0,"I wish I would've read the reviews first...I was expecting a KNITTED cardigan. What I got, however, is a very thin open front nylon material top. Would return it but I don't want all the hassle over 15 bucks. Very disappointed. Will never buy from this company again"
1.0,"It feels like it would be comfortable, however i was sent the wrong size. It was supposed to be a 38DDD. The package says its 38D. It already broke and front closure broke. It's awful!!"
1.0,I charged these pants overnight press the start button it never heated up nor did the power button light up
1.0,Does not fit. Returning
1.0,Sent back. Too big
1.0,I love the fit of the glasses and the weight but the lens are blurry....UGH
1.0,It‚Äôs just really cheep
1.0,They are beautiful but so heavy they stretch my piercings.
1.0,These goggles do not over glasses.  I returned them within 24 hrs after receiving.
1.0,"did not return mone back ,I return it."
1.0,Very pretty fit the ear well....but Is a heavy earring and makes your ear lean out...looks odd. Honestly will probably just sit in my jewelry box for years or I'll give it away..
1.0,This must be a women's size 9. 2/3 the size of my existing Men's size 9 vibram heel.  Ask for dimensions before ordering any size of this model heel. I could not use this for Men's size 9 boot.
1.0,Very thin material... no support<br />Didn't work for what zi was looking for
1.0,Very cheap quality not worth any penny . Size is huge than my regular size. Return it right away.
1.0,Soft rubber. Floppy. Gems fell out the  first day.
1.0,"For the price of the coat, I was extremely disappointed in the quality. It is definitely not like what's in the pictures!!"
1.0,Horrible quality. Very flimsy. Definitely not worth the price.
1.0,Very confusing. Not worth the money
1.0,The charms fell  off.  I lost two of them on  the second day I had them  on my crocs.
1.0,ES MUY MALA CALIDAD
1.0,This thing doesn‚Äôt cover anything. Kinda defeats the purpose!
1.0,"My husband works in the Fashion Industry and he said the photos shown with the toddler's wearing the zip cardi is not what you are getting.  Here are his comments:<br /><br />(1) It is clearly deceiving that they used a stock photo from another supplier and made their own version.  The fabric of the hooded cardi worn by the kids is made either of a boucle, felt, or fleece type of material... much thicker. The one you are getting is a heather light weight french terry fabric.  You can even see in the photos there is edge stitching on the dinosaur pointed scales, but the one you get does not have this.<br /><br />(2) The workmanship and quality inspection is non-existent.  There were a lot of long loose and untrimmed thread inside of the garment, especially at the back bottom hem.  At the top of the kangaroo pocket, the stitching just runs off onto the body instead of back-stitching on the pocket.  At the bottom of the Zipper placket, the single needle stitching was not back-tacked either.  As a result, the thread is unraveling.<br /><br />(3) Zipper gets stuck at the top of the kangaroo pockets, and I don't know why.  I don't see anything interfering with it but it gets stuck, then I have to give it a harder yank to get it through.  The only thing I can think of is maybe this is where the garment was folded in half and maybe the zipper tape can't flatten out.  Either way, not good.<br /><br />(4) The Care Instructions state: ""Wash Separately, Professional Dry Clean Recommended.""<br />However, the Care Symbols are: Hand Wash Cold, Low Iron, Do Not Bleach, Drip Dry.<br />This is very confusing and contradicting from the Care Instructions and Care Symbols.  What parent is going to Dry Clean a child's 95% Cotton / 5% Polyester garment?  But then again, the garment is falling apart and would probably need to.  It should at least be:  ""Machine Wash Cold, Gentle Cycle.  Only Non-Chlorine Bleach When Needed.  Tumble Dry Low.  Medium Iron."""
1.0,"Ordered this sweatshirt and a different print arrived. Super bummed as this was a Christmas gift for my husband and he would have really liked the option shown. Instead I now have a Cubs sweatshirt that reads &#34;We Didn't Suck&#34; which I'm fairly certain he won't wear. I'll likely return this one, but tomorrow being Christmas Eve, this really does suck."
1.0,"I‚Äôve had this band for exactly 2 weeks.  At first I liked this band okay enough. It is larger that other large bands that I have purchased but it‚Äôs okay because there‚Äôs holes all around it.  The excess band that hangs past the loops kept getting caught on things.  That is annoying but I tried to over look it.  Well today, after a couple days of random itchiness, I took the band off to see if something bit  me and noticed a small rash and peeled skin.  (The picture was taken a while after I took the watch off to allow it to air out so it looks much better now.) I do not have sensitive skin at all but I have had some kind of reaction to the metal part of the band.  I will not be wearing if again and I hate to even try to return it since it‚Äôs been worn however, this is not okay.  Please don‚Äôt buy this."
1.0,No dislikes. This product was very satisfactory.  Love it
1.0,Ordered these a while ago and loved them. Reordered them recently and they are totally different pants and are way too long. They are not the same pants as the ones pictured.
1.0,Horrible quality. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend
1.0,"Ordered the 2mm 16inch black necklace and the Clasp came right off the string. As soon as I opened it from the package!!<br /><br />I do have the 18 inch and that one is amazing. But the 16 inch was broken upon using, 16 inch has no durability!!"
1.0,Horrible dress!! Cheaply made and junk material. I would return it if I wasn't outside my return window
1.0,Its smaller than expected and as thin as a long sleeve tee shirt. The Ghostbusters emblem was deformed.
1.0,This has zero gold on it or in it or near it. Weighs as much as a gum all machine ring.
1.0,"From reading the reviews for these I thought these might help my heel spur, but if anything they made matters worse. Waste of money. Very disappointed."
1.0,The button edges are razor sharp. Sliced my finger!
1.0,*****UPDATE*****after wearing 3 Times the elastic in the stop broke and  there‚Äôs no wearing it anymore<br /><br />It‚Äôs cute! BUT the biggest issue is it‚Äôs completely see through in direct sunlight/light. So you either need to find a shift you can wear under it or only wear it in dark places
1.0,The pants it‚Äôs so small
1.0,"Wish I would have returned this, but it looked nice enough. However it quickly deteriorated based on how the clips to attatch it got be watch face were designed. Eventually I caught it on something small and the clip itself bent. Maybe I could have repaired it, but the band was already ripped so I threw it away. Maybe three weeks of wear totally. Took it off when washing my hands, washing dishes, and even when it rained."
1.0,I ordered this a month before i got married and a diamond fell out! not even 2 months later another diamond fell out!
1.0,Necklace was broken at connection of chain and pendant.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:7943bcbd6d2f21090504c2a57831caa2]] For high intensity workouts it won‚Äôt stay in place.  It was moving around it don‚Äôt stay where it should.
1.0,Worked for a good 10 minutes
1.0,Good product if bottom don‚Äôt peel off. After one wash it‚Äôs worse.
1.0,Don't like this purchase
1.0,Super thin... 2 to 3 sizes too small... nothing like pictured or described. It fit in my mailbox. I definitely sent it back for refund.
1.0,Works good  but after while the lining in hat came apart and then and now the speakers keeps coming apart ans moving around in the hat sounded good for however long that it did last
1.0,"Bought my usual size in this dress and was so excited, but it was an absolute joke to see on my body. The chest area would not even go over the first half of my chest. I could size up and it probably still wouldn't go over my chest area fully"
1.0,Cheap from over seas I guess plus to them is a size 8
1.0,"If you are looking for slouchy socks that don‚Äôt stay up, then look no further."
1.0,The quality is awful and they even look cheap. Will not by again
1.0,See above. Do no buy for softness  or sizing.
1.0,Sizing is way off. We measured and ordered per the sizing instructions. The bottoms are way too large and has very thin fabric. The swimsuit took weeks to arrive and the cost to return is astronomical and not worth it. Beware before purchasing.
1.0,"The leggings looked old and stretched out after 1-2 times wearing. Leggings were not durable at all, lasted only a 2-3 weeks."
1.0,The ankles and up are hard to pull through.
1.0,"Easily ripped, very thin, garbage"
1.0,"Received the two pack, thought they looked good, liked the draw string.  Put them on and immediately they felt tight around the thighs.  Now I am not a small guy so I bought 3x because these were for around the house, comfy pants.  They fit at the waist however the thighs and leg cut is very tight. Couple this with the zero stretch factor and they ripped within minutes after doing my first set of chores in them.  Garbage."
1.0,Simply put:they don‚Äôt work. The magnet is not strong enough to get through my nose. Could be cause I have a thick nose lol but they need to be stronger magnets
1.0,Hate them. They fit  awful. Only gave them one star because it made me in order to post
1.0,The clothes have a stain the can‚Äôt come off
1.0,Dress was to short and to tight. Buy 1-2 size larger.
1.0,"The bottom stone looks blue in the picture, but says it's purple in the description. Yet when I received then the stones was crystal."
1.0,I will be returning the artist aprons for kids because they<br />disintegrated inside the bag. This picture shows how the aprons completely fell apart. Will not buy again.
1.0,i got this bag for a hiking trip and is tiny and useless. even too small for my kids school books. I got a couple of bottles of water in it and a poncho and that was about it was going to let my boy have it for school but the bag is so narrow that his books couldn't go in it ... had to return it. do not for any reason buy. this bag if useless.
1.0,Not what you are thinking if you wear a Stormy Kromer hat.<br />Not a plaid flannel.
1.0,Material is too thin and look cheaply made. These pants run very small and do not stretch much. I ordered an xxl which is one size up from what I usually wear and I could not pull them all the way up. Not worth returning to China when you have to pay for shipping. This was a waste of money. I would not buy again.
1.0,Ordered  2  both ridiculous.
1.0,"I liked the shirt when I got it. It‚Äôs the soft kind of t shirt, slightly fitted. The actual graphics on the shirt felt a little cheap and thick. After I washed it the first time I took it out of the wash and the thread at the bottom of the shirt was unraveled and half the bottom has come apart. So turns out the shirt is very cheap. I contacted the seller 3 days ago to ask them what I should do since I‚Äôve alreqdy worn it. I never heard back from them. Don‚Äôt buy this."
1.0,"I placed an order for a medium black pin stripe, received an XL. Returned that to order correct size and received a 2XL.<br /><br />I‚Äôm done!"
1.0,They are not what I expected the material is rough and the shoe is to wide
1.0,"This dress was ALMOST perfect!  Unfortunately, I'm 5'6"" and it the dress was higher than mid-thigh.  Other than that, the material was nice and the design of the dress with the tiers is adorable.  I would suggest this dress for shorter girls."
1.0,after one month the belt fell on the floor and the metal pin actually broke off. no kidding.  unbelievable.
1.0,They do not stay up on my calf.
1.0,Don't waste your money. NOTHING like the picture.
1.0,Fit good üôÇüôÇ
1.0,This did not stick and would no detach from the contact paper.
1.0,These are worthless.
1.0,"These leggings are an absolute joke. I‚Äôm very surprised at Amazon would sell a product of this low caliber. The leggings are not really ripped, rather, the ribs are in the fabric and it looks like they are ripped but they are not. They don‚Äôt have a button or a zipper either that‚Äôs also in the fabric. Super tacky! I would not be caught dead in these things!"
1.0,Double vision under water.  Yes the outside protective film was removed.
1.0,"Pendant is heavy and nicely made. Necklace is not same quality as pendant. Necklace is flimsy, weightless, different color"
1.0,"Too small, not for average adult female or teenager, and they charge $5 for a return fee."
1.0,Poorly made.  Manage your expectations.
1.0,Se puso negro desde el primer d√≠a que lo utilice
1.0,"Used once, fit my needs perfectly, wrapped in tissue paper and put away for next use, took it out and the gold color on the clasp was half gone! Useless now."
1.0,I had these for approximately 4 months and then the lens started fogging up. Totally unwearable after this starts to happen. Save your money and look elsewhere.
1.0,Too small- sizes are off.
1.0,Ordered 3 not 1 update or help to get an update
1.0,"DO NOT buy this dress. it is terribly made, it‚Äôs unbelievable itchy on the inside and it‚Äôs not made at all to the quality that the photos portray. it is clearly just rows of sequins sewn on, no sparkles, just sequins.. i would never wear this dress- such cheap quality."
1.0,"Not sized properly, they run on small"
1.0,I weigh 105 and these are so tight I can't even get them on. Hoodie? NO they have no hoodie but that's fine with me since I don't like hoodies. LOVE the material so much. If you order go up 2 sizes not one. I'm so disappointment because they are perfect in every way if I could wear them. I've been looking for this exact style forever. Guess I'll give up.
1.0,Item is terrible had two months and already coming apart. Doesn‚Äôt keep my hands warm either. Can‚Äôt believe I spent money on this item.
1.0,"these shoes are terrible. They shed glitter everywhere. All the glitter off the fronts we‚Äôre gone in 2 days and they had huge holes in the toes after like, 6 days. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money."
1.0,Very poor quality logo with white blotch. Unwearable in public
1.0,"Gorgeous however the clip is not put on well; I reordered this earring since the clip broke the first time I wore them and the same thing happened to the second pair. Returning as ""BROKEN""."
1.0,I purchased a medium and it was about the size of a small
1.0,Stiff material.  Not comfortable at all.  Will be donating these.  Size way off.  Not made in USA
1.0,Material felt low quality and the item was not pretty. The size small fits more like a large.
1.0,"No Warranty or way to contact manufacturer. Stem came completely off somewhere within 4 months making it non functional.  Guess I should have stuck with a $15 Casio digital with buttons.  Forgot how much functionaityl is missing from analog watches (no month indicator, day counter which indicates 31 days in every month and thus has to be reset.  Inexpensive with a relative nice looking fabric/leather strap which peridically would come unbuckled.  Using it to ""decorate"" my dresser with other deposable junk."
1.0,Item runs small. Buy two sizes up
1.0,I purchased this watch for a Christmas present. When it arrived the glass was broken so I began the return process. Since it was a Christmas gift I ordered a replacement right away. The second watch showed up today and was also broken! I am requesting a refund and will not be ordering it again!
1.0,The finish on the skull rubbed off in a few days
1.0,I was looking for a very dark lense that you couldn't see my eyes through.  However I wanted to see out of them.  These are so dark that you can't see out and for sure no one can see in.
1.0,Cute rings but they turned my fingers green. I liked one so much I tried to coat the inside with clear fingernail polish and wear it anyway but it tarnished and ended up looking bad anyway.
1.0,Very sad. Bought this as a gift and it broke right as he picked it up. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. üò™
1.0,Ok had it 2 weeks and already coming apart
1.0,Attempted to wear once; wouldn't stay on well and when pulled tight it was painful.
1.0,Not worth the money I paid for it. It was extremely flimsy and the yellow sticker on the front was crooked.
1.0,"The shirt material is substandard , and is see-through."
1.0,Not good both hats i ordered the logo was not put on correctly it is not acceptable for professional use i guess if you don't mind your logo all disorientated but I care both beginning and end d are not right and the colors are wrong there should be no white. I wont be ordering through them again.
1.0,It did not fit at all wasn‚Äôt even close to fitting
1.0,After 6 weeks the stone just fell off the ring.  Had to return it<br />Dp
1.0,"The jeans, fit as expected but did not look like picture. There were no ease creases across front. The Denim-was stretchy but very light weight. It felt like it would get peels and tear easily."
1.0,Very unsatisfied with this ring!!  Diamonds start falling out in less than a 4 months!! Cheap craft made be aware.
1.0,"I do not like the cut, it is too wide in the ass, although the waist is normal, and the disproportionately narrowed at the bottom."
1.0,These are not cotton sweatbands. The are not absorbent and the fabric is horrible. Please don't waste your money.
1.0,I  ordered these and I do not climb up your ear like it says they do.  Very disappointed.  Helps through your ear
1.0,Did not receive the bag in the picture. Not a bowler bag. Got some dome shaped studded bag with bows all over.<br />How do I get the bag from the picture and description?
1.0,"I order a size larger for comfort and it was still tight and looks way different in person,would never order from them again."
1.0,"I am returning these earrings.  The french wire on the earrings I received does not match the ones in the photo.  On the earrings I received, the french wire is thick in parts, uneven and won't even go in my ear.  I'm very disappointed."
1.0,I got a 3x and it would usually be baggy but it was to tight
1.0,Just another low quality item
1.0,DO NOT BUY THESE if you do a lot of walking!!!! I work on a golf course and own a landscaping company . I do a time of walking. These underwear Suck! They lasted about 3 washes. The are Light duty at Best. Suck Suck Suck. Amazon should quit selling these.
1.0,They do not stay up on ear.
1.0,One post back was missing
1.0,I had expectations that these boots would last a couple of years. But lasted only 2.5 months. I wear these to and from work; I wear ski boots for work.<br />First the tab at the rear fell off. No big deal. Then I noticed the laces needed be replaced. No big deal. Now I noticed that the black rubber upper has cracks in both boots. Now that's a big deal and renders the boots useless especially in CO.
1.0,Not at all like it looks in the picture! Very short and poorly made.
1.0,The suite was labeled XXXL and was very small for a medium build man.
1.0,"WAY too small. Like, not even a little bit the right size. And almost no padding. ‚ÄúAdd a cup‚Äù my ass! Also, with all this COVID crap going on they should have extended their return time limit,  but apparently I missed the window by a few days. Which means I‚Äôm stuck with a too-small, completely useless bra that I really needed the money back to buy a different bra. NOT HAPPY!!"
1.0,"Loved this at first, wore it to the beach as a dress and a cover up, but after that one wear...the back seam started to separate. Item fit loose as expected and reached my knee, I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 220 lbs."
1.0,I was super excited when this item arrived and put it to quick use. Within 3 days of use it started fraying and eventually broke.
1.0,"The cloth quality is very cheap, very light weight. The style is not as expected. The cloth becomes unusable after few washes."
1.0,"Terrible product. From the picture, it appears 1/3 of each wrap expands with the chilling beads. Not in reality. What I received was 2 wraps with about 1/8 expandable and 2 wraps about 1/4 expandable. Also, the part that was expandable was improperly sewn on two of the wraps, so the 1/8 or 1/4 expandable part wasn‚Äôt expandable all across. I understand my description might be confusing. I am trying to describe poor quality control, incorrect item description, and an unusable product. I requested a return and refund."
1.0,"This dress runs very small. I ordered an extra large as recommended by everything I say (I'm 5'4, 200lbs, size 14-16) and I couldn't even get the dress over my head."
1.0,No the same item as pictured. They have a flat metal back. The ‚Äústones‚Äùare plastic.
1.0,Way too small. Returned.
1.0,Disliked everything about it
1.0,As mentioned...expensive pair of long John's with a Polo logo in them. They get stretchy and flimsy. Glad I got them on sale. Would not recommend.
1.0,"This doesn't seem comfy or cozy. The material is almost like a flannel type of clingy thingy. I felt like I might combust, the complete opposite of anti-inflammatory fabric. I sent it back without a second thought."
1.0,Me enviaron un mensaje q la hab√≠an entregado y nunca recib√≠ nada.
1.0,"I ordered these glasses in Aug 2020. Seven months later, after only light usage, they broke. I'm quite disappointed in the quality of this product."
1.0,I gout the largest size. Too small. The sizing is Asian sizing the US sizes. Make sure to check the measurements to make sure it will fit. I had to give mine away to my cousin. It fits her and she wears an 8 ....I think?
1.0,Very very misleading!!! Ordered a large. Instead is a small. I couldn‚Äôt get it on
1.0,Fitted smaller than I expected.
1.0,"zero stars! not at all as pictured! I wanted a wig that looked like garth from Wayne's world. this wig looks like an 80s hair band member would wear. sure, garth was a FAN of those bands but he didn't look like he belonged in one. super disappointed that this totally threw off my costume."
1.0,These are junk.  The back tab to secure it to the wallet pocket tears in about two days.
1.0,It was laughable how small this was. It barely covered my boobs. So maybe it would of been fine if I was an A cup and not a DDD.
1.0,Receive the product today and it was broken.
1.0,I never got to wear them. Both the posts came out and the 2 front teeth also came out.
1.0,material is SUPER thin. I always wear smalls and this one was a size a child would wear. don't waste your money
1.0,"If you're buying this hat because you truly belive what it says,  then you should go to the airport and buy a one way ticket out of this great country.  America is the greatest country on earth,  if you don't belive me move to North Korea for a little while and see for yourself"
1.0,I love the look .. but i bought it and open it to try it on and it broke.. didn‚Äôt even last more than 10 mins.. and my wrist is not even big but somehow when I went to tried on the finger piece that‚Äôs when it broke
1.0,Material was way too thin
1.0,At first the worn look on the decorative end was fine but to see it on the teeth of the key is not ok. Poorly crafted jewelry!
1.0,"Design come off after first wash, didn't even get to wear it."
1.0,"Cliff Note Version (Because Neither This Product Nor Its Vendor Are Worthy Of Your Time): Avoid this China vendor and their extremely small, poorly printed products.<br /><br />Full Review: I recently bought a half-dozen different Apollo 11 shirts to commemorate that event's 50th anniversary this year. This shirt is leaps and bounds cheaper than anything else I received from multiple vendors. I can't recommend this vendor, but if you do throw all caution to the wind and place an order make sure you select a size at least 2 sizes up from what you normally buy. I wear a Large, and based on the vendor reviews decided I better order 2X Extra Large. It just fits.<br /><br />Also, the design is really tiny (Apollo logo not much bigger than a quarter; see photo). The product photo must be of a Child Extra Extra Small shirt. I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The print quality is terrible (see photo again). The words ""Apollo 11"" in the logo are barely legible, and ""United States"" wording on the Saturn V is entirely unreadable. If you thought the picture looked fuzzy because it's a low-res web graphic, it's not. It's fuzzy because the printing is blurry. There's a fuzzy ghost halo around much of the design. A high-res photo would look no better.<br /><br />Finally, this vendor is in China. I was suspicious at this price and specifically checked the vendor listing, but they're extremely cautious not to list one word that suggests this comes on the slow boat. I was still unable to determine the shipping location until I actually received tracking information.<br /><br />Bottom line, avoid this vendor and their extremely small, poorly printed products."
1.0,Why are all dart flights designed for women pink? We aren't all about pink like men think we are. So unoriginal.
1.0,It's a little hot.  It does have good coverage. I would prefer if they had different colors
1.0,"Reason I bought this product was I wanted a decent pair of socks and gloves so I can grip my yoga mat better in practice. Hot yoga makes it difficult at times to get a suitable grip on the mat.<br /><br />Well... I bought this product because it said one size fits all. Not true! The product was for a small medium person, obviously. I did get it to fit on my feet and hands but it pinched and hurt my fingers and toes. I can't practice yoga if my feet and fingers are in pain! So I am returning these and warning others that if you know you have big hands and feet these won't work."
1.0,Tha masks were much too small and pulled on my ears. They may be more suitable for children or youngsters.
1.0,"I wanted to love this crop top. I did. I tried and it did not work. The material is not see through at all and does have an excellent stretch, but I cannot over look the fabric choice. It was sort of like a cheap bathing suit material mixed with some cheap costume. Unfortunately, this is just a no."
1.0,NOPE
1.0,Ordered two of your duffle bags and one of them the zipper is broken so I sent it back just noticed the other one after using it this weekend is broken too. Not very good quality. I ordered one from China and wow what a difference much better quality sad to say.
1.0,Runs very small!! Not true to size.
1.0,"This is a rag don,t buy it"
1.0,I bought the one in the rainbow color. the color is not as vibrant at all it‚Äôs iridescent but a pale iridescent so if you‚Äôre looking for vibrant colors do not purchase this bracelet I‚Äôm very disappointed
1.0,So disappointed. I was looking forward to these pants. They feel like sandpaper and the fit is atrocious.
1.0,"Very light, cheap feeling and looking. Not what I thought I was getting. I returned product."
1.0,I am sad to say how disappointed I was in this charm. I had it professionally added to a bracelet for my granddaughter who is 12 years old. In a very short time the charm actually broke in half. Based on the price I expected better quality.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and it is way too large for me let alone my kid. Returning.
1.0,My earrings came in broken.  One earring had part of the clasp completely missing and the other one had a bent clasp.  Other than being broken they look nice.  Big and pretty light weight.
1.0,Shirt is very ugly and cheap looking in person. Absolutely different from pictures as Amazon clothing usually is. Shirts made in China and definitely looks it
1.0,"Very bad quality, it is a 100%  worse than the pictures on web.<br />I will never wear it..."
1.0,"I haven't even worn the rings yet and they're already tarnished. Really disappointed, especially since the other reviews were so good."
1.0,I bought a med.(I'm a solid med.) and it was way too small. I then bought a large and it was too small as well. I finally bought an xl and it is wearable but small for an xl. Now I'm afraid to wash it and dry it per the instructions for fear it won't fit after that.
1.0,"Bought the blue one with link flowers, as well as a couple of others. The others were great - fit/quality matched. This blue one is a COMPLETELT different materials not slinky or stretchy, more like cheap t shirt material. And its fully 4 inches shorter than the other dresses in the same size."
1.0,Cute but one of  The earrings was broken
1.0,I'm 5'5 and the dress reached just below my knees. Definitely a misleading product!
1.0,"This is not the cute sweater you think it will be. It's this weird material, doesn't feel like knit anything and the the neck trim is like 2 inches wide. Belt was at my belly button."
1.0,I was so happy when it arrived only 2 unpack it with a busted zipper and i need it in 2 days
1.0,It broke easily with in 2 day I received key-chain
1.0,fell apart after just a few weeks
1.0,Too small. ....  sizing isn't accurate.
1.0,This is fake‚Ä¶ The item is not as pictured at all and I‚Äôm super disappointed‚Ä¶ Not only is it not off the shoulder it is way too long‚Ä¶ even the fabric looks and feels completely different than in the photo... I am extremely disappointed and feel scammed‚Ä¶ Do not buy this
1.0,"Do not buy! Hard to breathe, hot, clostrophobic.  To wash, must soak for 5 minutes in 80- 90 degree distilled water and wash gently by hand and dry naturally.  Thumbs down.  Made in China."
1.0,Have ordered Jessica Simpson shoes before and knew they ran small but I ordered 9.5 instead of my usual 8.5 and they still fit tight.<br />The straw on the bottom of the wedge is incorrectly glued as well as the leather being faded and old looking even though they just arrived today.
1.0,went ahead and kept them but they are way too SMALL !!!!!!!!
1.0,"No me gusta ,lo voy arregalar ,feo ,cuadrado ,un color opaco ,dif√≠cil de poner y peor para quitar"
1.0,Really cute design.  Was very smelly and didn‚Äôt feel safe to breathe in the material for any length of time.
1.0,"Just got a band (silver) and 1 side won't clasp to watch .. bummer .. returning, wish I would've read reviews first!"
1.0,"I diligently read all the positive reviews and checked the pictures before purchasing. Unfortunately, I failed to notice all the good ones were over a year old. Not sure if they are trying to cut costs in 2020, but the material was SO thin, SO scratchy, the hems barely sewn together, that this dress WOULD NOT be appropriate or comfortable to wear anywhere. The most hope it has is to be part of a cheap Halloween ensemble (think plastic prepackaged dress quality) but not even close to worth the price tag. Stay away."
1.0,"Poor quality, dry clean only"
1.0,The material is cheaper than cheap. The cut would work except it drops by two sizes in the chest.
1.0,"Bad quality and fabric. Nothing I‚Äôd wear or recommend anyone wear. Very flimsy fabric that could pass for underclothes. Also if you decide to return, it‚Äôll have to be on your own fine. Scam China company!"
1.0,It‚Äôs already broken. I bought few days ago. It‚Äôs very low quality. I will not recommend anyone to waste money
1.0,"The necklace looks just like the picture and it‚Äôs light-weight. I REALLY liked the way it looked. However, it broke within minutes of putting it on. I repaired it with a safety pin to attempt to get through the night, and it continued to break in different areas of the necklace."
1.0,The fur looks nothing like the picture ..<br />Wanted the cow print ! Not all dark fur !
1.0,"I really really liked these frames a lot, from the wood to the wayfarer silhouette. Until they broke on me as I was putting them on, the right eye framing snapped as I was putting them on and it just made me sad. I really thought that I was a going to have a long relationship with this pair but sadly i was robbed from that. I don't even want to attempt in super gluing them, im just so sad at this point."
1.0,The ends where the necklace crimps are are coming off. Which means it will not hook since the crimps are coming off! Will not buy ever again!
1.0,Just give to my sister I don‚Äôt like it it‚Äôs too big to me
1.0,One slipper is wider than the other
1.0,Was a really cheap gag but failed immediately don‚Äôt buy
1.0,"We loved the look of the bracelet, but it has a poor clasp and won't stay on."
1.0,"Horrible quality, especially for $10 a piece. They are beautiful in person, got them as a gift for me and my sister. Had them for 2 days and one of the earrings has already broke. Highly disappointed, don't waste your money."
1.0,This fits very weird. I got a size large (bust 36-40 with a small waist) but I couldn't button past the bottom 3 buttons & the back was kind of baggy. This runs very small & I would of needed to go 2 sizes up in this.
1.0,These jeans are HUGE and I ordered a small.
1.0,This band broke the second day I wore it! I gave it one star only because you have to make a selection
1.0,cheaply made runs small
1.0,Junk . Fell apart
1.0,"I ordered a xs and it was WAY to big looked like a large. Disappointed. Wouldn't even give it one star but I had to, to submit my review."
1.0,I did not appreciate one of the reps contacting me about changing my feed back. That is why it went from a 3 to a 1.
1.0,Way too small maybe for a child this will work not for an adult
1.0,"This ""Deputy badge like Sherif Cowboy style Metal Enamel Lapel Pin Badge"" is not badge-sized. Yes, you could wear it on your lapel, but it is more like a tie tack. It's about the size of a postage stamp, and not a large postage stamp either. No size measurement is listed in the description other than ""Deputy badge like Sherif"" (misspelling included)."
1.0,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. She loves fidget rings to keep herself from picking on her nails. I gave her the silver and kept the gold for myself. The first day I wore it I noticed within 6 hours it had already started turning my skin green! I washed my hands 1 time. I have attached a picture, you will also notice the beads are changing colors and losing the gold tone. Such a waste of money! Don't bother!!"
1.0,"very small and tight, but a size up"
1.0,Terrible spongey material..
1.0,"I was really excited to get these. I am transgender, kinda curvy. This fit about as well as a condom fits over my air conditioner. it didn't fit at all. After adjusting the back as far as it would go, I managed to clip the front, then all of a sudden it ripped. I would have been able to recover the forms had the seam not ripped with the latch. So I hope that the company I bought these from enjoys their free $90, because I certainly won't be able to use their product. Thank you for the con."
1.0,Shape and fit was very odd. Do not size up.
1.0,Black is rubbing off already.  Didnt think this could happen.  Too late to return for a full refund I believe! If it is still possible I want a REFUND!
1.0,This is not as pictured! The skirt doesn‚Äôt have 3 tiers nor does it feel anything like a cotton fabric! So disappointed! Plus the waist size might go around my cat!! I wear a size 8 and ordered a large in anticipation of a tighter waist size but this was ridiculous!
1.0,It had a bad smell and was making me sick. Had to put it in the garage.
1.0,"Received the rings, but they were two shades of yellow. I paid good money for my custom Oakley and decided to touch them up with these custom parts. Unfortunately, with the rings pair not being the same shade of color degrades my customization. Returned the items."
1.0,"Too big, Pattern ugly"
1.0,"Very bad fabric, having bobling withing few days. First time, I  REGRET because it was expensive and quality was not according to the brand name.  My worst online shopping experience."
1.0,Not cotton. Pattern smeared. Thin material.  Hem is frayed. Dry clean only.
1.0,"This is a very cute but poor quality bathing suit. The bottom half is very thin, the top half on the one I received was very poorly stitched together where the straps were. My daughter wore it two days before the straps broke while she was swimming. Which was a pretty embarrassing scene for an 11 year old. I tried to hand sew it back together as best I could. By the end of the vacation it was in tatters. The look of it was nice, she loved it initially. Comfortable, well sized. But thin and poorly stitched."
1.0,the pants i got are literally a different pair of pants then in the pic. when i got them they were like weird silk pajamas pretty much. they had no fly but had a belt loop and they a were really weird lengths. definently would not recommend these pants. they looked like something some dude would put on when he got home from the bar and was super drunk and didn't care what the butt his pants looked like. like their literally silk and nerdy and look like a buttcheelk
1.0,Not happy that we‚Äôve had these for just over a month (only wore them about 5 times) and my son bent over to pick something up and the entire crotch ripped open. He‚Äôs thin and the sweats aren‚Äôt too tight. Not really thrilled with spending almost $40 for something that is unwearable about 5 times.
1.0,Didn't match the picture of the product
1.0,Disappointed with this product. It looks very cheap and I have purchased several pendants but for some reason this on as not as good üò´
1.0,"Get what you pay for- these are less than useless. Size is all off, material is THIN, these are junk."
1.0,"As you can clearly see, the advertised picture of the item is a dress that falls at the knee on the model. My picture of tge dress I received shows it is well above the knees, more like a mini skirt, at mid thigh length. I am of average height and build. I would never have purchased it if the product picture was accurate. I requested a refund due to inaccurate description and they granted the refund but required me to pay return shipping. I wrote again to request return shipping be covered by them because the item I received was not what was advertised. They said their item was fine and said I needed to then send them a picture. I did that now. They should fully refund with return shipping and send a confirmation email. Just want to warn others so they don't have to go through all this because I am disappointed with this company's product and unprofessional protocol to address valid customer concerns. This is not customary for products we purchase through Amazon and this company should be red flagged for not being able to resolve such issues promptly and courteously."
1.0,"Disappointed, these were defective and will probably fall apart the first time they are washed. Otherwise, they fit well and are nice overall."
1.0,After one hour I got an allergic reaction my ears were on fire!
1.0,Aweful....the length of the dress doesn't match the description. It is a complete waste of money. No way I can wear this dress and it can covrr my boobs. Needless to say the material is not good at all. If anything I would like to return it. I am giving it a rating of one star b/c I have to rate this item otherwise I would have given no star.
1.0,"I purchased the Harry Potter Slytherin compression socks. While they arrived on time, the only good thing about them, they are terribly made and look like they were made with dirty socks or rolled up while the ink was wet. Uncomfortable and terrible looking. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
1.0,White dress is see through
1.0,Fabric awful.  Very unattractive
1.0,Runs small. Could not wear the ones I ordered.
1.0,Very disappointed. Necklace is very small and exceptionally thin....looks like something you would buy at a 99 cent store.  Don't waste your money!!!
1.0,"Too ""old maid-ish""."
1.0,This one was a mess ripped faded and just not a good brand. Have previously gotten this bag in other colors and this bag did not sit well with me . After a few wears this bag did not work well. Don‚Äôt waste your money hate it with a capital H.
1.0,"My package arrived with good timing and seemed sealed, once opened the package it came in a ziplock type baggy..<br />I ordered 2 and only recieved 1.<br />Once i opened that, the bra had looked as if it was already worn multiple times. With adhesive peeling everywhere and the edge has black lint.<br />I definitely will not order again."
1.0,"This dress is very thin. You can see right through it, especially in the sun."
1.0,It doesn't stick to my tongue
1.0,"Cheap and off balance, never sits right when wearing."
1.0,"I don't know why this is advertised as a swimdress because it is not. It is not made of swimsuit material, it's see though and at best could be used as a swim suit cover up but its so poorly made Inwouldnt even use it at that. It looks nothing like the picture and the straps were barely even sewn on. When I tried to put it on the strap broke off because of how poorly constructed it is. I also went by the size chart and it is huge."

1.0,Don‚Äôt waste your time. The 3XL looks like a medium.
1.0,Worst quality neck gaiter / buff I‚Äôve ever bought . It doesn‚Äôt stretch much . I have a small bead and was tight getting it on.<br />I bought o e fir my boyfriend as well but there is no way he will be able to get it over his he‚Äôd .<br />It‚Äôs not made from stretch fabric like all my good quality ones.<br />I only bought them because the doxies on them . It‚Äôs cute but useless
1.0,I purchased this watch a year ago and the numbers are falling off where they should be
1.0,I thought I was ordering Bamboo fabric underwear.  The actual underwear says 100% cotton
1.0,I guess the Chinese that made this shirt can‚Äôt spell?

1.0,Too small for me and seems to break easily
1.0,The sizing was way off. They are cute but had to return.
1.0,This Product Is Nothing As Described. I was basically sent a huge t shirt.
1.0,Will not keep the water out if it rains
1.0,Very thing plastic material. I returned it
1.0,"I paid $32 for these because they were advertised as sterling silver.  I cannot wear plated jewelry, as it tarnishes. Although they are very pretty, they tarnished within a week.  No way are these sterling silver.  I‚Äôm out 32$ and lovely earrings."
1.0,"These were much shorter than the cover-ups pictured. I will not use them, nor will I order clothing from you again"
1.0,"These are horrible, cheaply made, they shrink about 2 sizes, thin material,<br />Do Not Buy"

1.0,Poor quality.  Fell apart.  I regret making this purchase

1.0,Too small - not at all true to size
1.0,"Ordered according to the size chart, way too small...."
1.0,This pendant is very nice but the chain came knotted and I can't get it unknotted. I'll have to go by a separate chain because it's a present and dont have time to return before her birthday.
1.0,First off these gloves are defective. They have threads hanging off of every finger. Second off there the thumb is not covered as shown in the picture. The finger tip cover doesn‚Äôt even cover enough of the thumb to keep my thumb warm. If I could I would give a rating of zero stars.  Due to Amazon putting a promotional credit on my account and not a gift card credit I can‚Äôt even get my money back on these awful gloves. This is the first time that Amazon has refused to make a bad situation right. I‚Äôm truly disappointed.
1.0,"Not what I expected sadly, it isn‚Äôt black but blue, quality is very low, and the design is only on one side... very cheap!"
1.0,"Love the style and quality of the sandals.  Due to it being too large, there's no support. The straps are too loose and size 7 was bigger than I expected.  Wish you offered a size 6.5. So I gave mine to my sister. It's such a hassle to return it."
1.0,Does not fit to size. I ordered a XXL and it was more like a medium.
1.0,This is very cheap and a terrible buy. Can go to Walmart and buy a real on instead of this plastic on.
1.0,It broke right away. Displeased.
1.0,This was terrible I put this on and the ball fell out the next morning. Didn‚Äôt want to give one star.

1.0,They were not sized as advertised
1.0,Awful quality!!! Tarnished and looked used. Very upset
1.0,Didn't work. Wouldn't stay on my glasses. Followed instructions. Waste pf money.
1.0,This is not true to size. Very very small.
1.0,This skirt was def not what I expected. It looked nothing like the picture and the material was cheap. This skirt did not flow at all. I'm usually satisfied with the items I purchase from here but this was a waiste of money. Hated it. Gave it to my kid to play dress up in because that is exactly what the material is made of.. Doll clothes. Smh
1.0,"They're supposed to be thicker and warm winter socks, but they're not any different than other socks at a store. I am very disappointed with this purchase. Not good for the New York snow and cold."
1.0,Seems more like a large kids shirt instead of a small women's shirt. Very boxy and odd fit. Didn't get a chance to try it in time since I had a baby the week it came in. Otherwise it would have gone straight back!
1.0,This size is horrible it's say 2xx and it's maybe a large. We will never order from here again
1.0,Won't wear this.
1.0,"The knit was so bad on one side, it looked like it had holes in it."
1.0,"Poor quality , dumpy looking dress that does absolutely nothing for your figure. I am 5 ‚Äò2 116 lbs. when I tried it on my husband said ‚Äúoh no‚Äù he said I looked like an old lady .  I hate returning things so I guess I will just try and give it way."
1.0,It makes you look like a big balloon if you are not small chested
1.0,Two of the four pair eye glasses' plastic frame are broken in six months. I total bought four pair of this eye glasses and two of the plastic frame broken. One of them was broken during the time I wared it. I had other pair eye glasses used for years
1.0,One simple asphalt fall and this thing was a goner. Now it‚Äôs tie-dye. üò≠
1.0,"I bought this niceEshop(TM) Fashion New Swarovski Elements Crystal Four Leaf Clover Pendant Necklace 19""-Olive Green, because i just love shamrocks,and like to wear my nationalities symbol for all to see. For the price i did not expect a whole lot, but what i got was far below my expectations. First of all It was broken, right out of the bag, upon opening. The clasp did not work and the chain is so cheap it looks like something from a bubble gum machine. The chain is very short and would have to get another chain in order to wear it. I will never buy another thing from the niceEshop."
1.0,It broke the first day my daughter wore it. I expected it to be cheap but not that cheap.
1.0,Very poor sewing
1.0,This is very cheap and the seams are not even closed!
1.0,Very blurry image on front.  NOT Five Finger Death Punch specific logo.
1.0,Shorter than I expected. Returned the top. Nothing wrong with it I just wanted something a little longer.
1.0,Dress was shorter than it looked.  I didn't like the fact that it only came to my ankles.
1.0,The dress is very thin and made of very harsh material. It‚Äôs feels like you are wearing a cardboard. Probably the worst dress I ever bought
1.0,Half the watches don't work. Waste of money.
1.0,These are so small it made me laugh...I threw them away.
1.0,Cheap I guess u get what u pay for lol
1.0,Color is orange and not red belt falling apart as I took it from the packaging.
1.0,"I knew that the product would run small, just not that small. I wear a size 2x so I went up one size larger on the order which is a 3x that fits likes a 1x. The material is great and very smooth. I would recommend that u go up two sizes when ordering this product"
1.0,"Pulled it out the package, put it on, and the hook fell off almost instantly. And I missed the return window so I'm out of my money. It's cute though."
1.0,White one is completely see through. Had to return it. Not sure what kind of lighting they used with the model to make it look the way it does in the pic
1.0,So it all looked cute when I pulled it out of the bag. But the thigh highs do not have the think band at the top like it shows so they didn‚Äôt look right once on. The eye covering came apart as I was tying it. I was better very careful with it too. Always fun when the costume you planned to wear ends up in the trash and you have to get creative real quick.
1.0,I bought this for my 15 ye old granddaughter. Middle stand of beads broke the first day she wore it. Second strand of beads broke second time she wore it.
1.0,Only washed twice and the hood is already coming undone from the neck of the jacket. I have previously purchased russel athletic sweatshirts before. Horribly dissatisfied with this quality control. Will update review when exchange is processed.
1.0,One side of band would not attach to watch. I will reorder.
1.0,Get a size smaller
1.0,False advertising. Does not have flaps for eyeglasses
1.0,"Cute. But runs small. I'm usually a. Size 6/8 and ordered the medium, I have to return it. The pattern on the fabric is very pretty but the fabric is polyester so I think it will be too sweaty on hot summer days. I'd prefer cotton shifts. Since this runs small, I reordered this in a large and after 3 weeks of waiting and several inquiries, I finally received notification that they were out of stock. It was frustrating since they sent me a tracking number for the shipment that never actually shipped. At first they claimed the shipment was lost, then they informed me that it never shipped due to the item being out of stock."
1.0,"This product arrived, but the fit is small, and the pattern is not as shown. I also ordered this thinking it would be a dark charcoal gray, and it arrived and is a very very light gray, almost lavender/white color. Not slouchy or loose as shown in the picture. Very disappointed and will be returning it."
1.0,Item was not what I expected. The leather/ imitation was very stiff and it had a strong fuel like order.
1.0,Bought for my mom for her birthday and the clasp was broken.
1.0,For the size indicated on the product it fell short.  The only piece that our grandson could fit was the zip up sweater.
1.0,Coat seems to be built for left-handed folks; Material is super-cheap. Will not keep you dry. Waste of money.
1.0,Horrible sizing!!!
1.0,"These are so cute, and they look to be of decent quality, but the sizing is terrible! I ordered a size large for my five year old who wears size 11 (I thought I would order it a bit big), and these are so tiny my three year old can barely wear them! So if you order them, order much, MUCH bigger than you think you need!"
1.0,Size 2xl is really a large
1.0,It broke when I first got it not good quality at all it is Where is the money do not buy this it is a  Rope off do not buy at all and don‚Äôt waste your time on it
1.0,"I like these shorts just not for the price, don't like the double layer inside shorts. It makes them to hot to wear."
1.0,Broke with in two day. Were advertised for sportsman but did not stand up. I was protest a new but never saw them.
1.0,"I bought this thinking it would be fun... but the minute I touched the fabric, I realized it was incompatible with skin. Even after washing it was extremely scratchy. I'll just rip it apart and use the pieces as a pattern to make my own in a fabric I actually enjoy"
1.0,Not worth the price... I was so exited to get them and got them but they're to big!!!!! As soon as I put them on the fell off! Probably cant return them now that they're scratched from hitting the gravel in my drive way
1.0,"Well this is a nice watch, however, it would be nicer if it actually worked! I am trying to charge it now but so far nothing is happening. I am very disappointed and embarrassed as it was a gift. Way to go vendor!"
1.0,"Super odd material - couldn't wear this anywhere - returned.<br />Fit and color were fine - as expected. But it is a super shiny, slick, weird material"
1.0,The chain was very fragile... like VERY fragile. It's for a kid obviously but they did not make it kid friendly or kid proof. Would've spent the few bucks elsewhere had I known
1.0,Their XL is a size 0 in the USA. I was so disappointed when i received the pants.
1.0,The fabric is awful. I wouldn‚Äôt even call it fabric. I can‚Äôt even touch it let alone try it on. This is the cheapest garment I‚Äôve ever seen.
1.0,Cheaply made started to fall apart after 2 months of use. Would not recommend getting this even slightly wet. The magnets are strong and held watch in place well but again the leather is not real and fell apart
1.0,These jeans were horrible. I ordered a xxl and it literally felt like an xxs!!!!
1.0,"I bought this to give someone as a gift. I could not give this as a gift because it looked like 'used' product, lo tabs, no labels, smells like perfume or something and etc... Not happy and returning..."
1.0,"This was not supernatural inspired at all. Don't waste your money. It's simply charms with different religious icons. Wish I hadn't bought it, because I had to buy another gift for the Supernatural fan I was giving it to. I wish sellers would actually KNOW what they are selling and their audience."
1.0,I received it with a stain and broken zipper and had to regretfully return it.
1.0,"If I could give it a zero, I would! Poor fabric quality!"
1.0,"What I have received looks absolutely nothing like the color as pictured. I received 2 pack of some kind of yellow green color cream VERY disappointed, the say the least!!! Why posting the wrong color with the correct name written on the container. That's definitely misleading."
1.0,Ridiculously short
1.0,The sizes were quite off. The shoulders extremely larger than was listed.
1.0,"way too small, i think the sizes are like girls sizes not womens, got an XL and it might fit a size 0-2 woman"
1.0,Not the color it states
1.0,I did NOT EVEN receive the dress I paid for i received a whole other dress. Very disappointed !!!!
1.0,This is total trash. I am no seamstress but I swear to god that I could have stitched a couple of blankets together and produced a better-quality product than this ridiculous bunny coat. My 9 year old started laughing so hard when she tried it on and told me that it was ‚Äúso stupid‚Äù. The sizing makes no sense and the quality is almost comical. There are no convenient returns for a reason. The seller knows their product is junk so they make the return process inconvenient and economically unfeasible.
1.0,***DO NOT BUY***<br />The information on the site is inaccurate. The bottom piece fits fine but the top doesn't fit a size S/M. It is like if it was cut and assembled wrong.
1.0,"A jeweler wasn't even able to adjust the band, so it's unusable. The band is big enough for a man."
1.0,"I‚Äôve learned that I can‚Äôt trust the reviews on Amazon...I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 140lbs and ordered a medium, these were huge on me! The crotch was really baggy and when I pulled it up to be high waisted it just looked terrible and nothing like the pictures. It‚Äôs too bad because I need pants and stores won‚Äôt let you try on pants because of covid. Also, these smelled funky and left a weird film in my hands after handling."
1.0,"actualy i was shocked when I got the wallet, it very cheap quality and the sleeves are very small so they are not fitting the credit cards at all."
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt like anything about this. The fit was awful, large but not in a good flow way. Just awkward. Colors are a bit different too. Material is cheap and thin. I sent it back."
1.0,"The leggings were comfy and soft but they‚Äôre thin and see-through. You could see my whole butt. The seller advertises free returns on the item page but when I went to return the leggings, they said they were going to deduct return shipping from my refund. Ao just save yourself the headache and don‚Äôt buy these."
1.0,Does not fit the size snaps as stated
1.0,Does not fit a fit bit versa 3
1.0,"I returned them as soon as I opened them...they felt like paper, not cotton, but paper. That's the best way I can describe the fabric.  No way was I putting this on my baby."
1.0,Arrived in bad condition
1.0,All three pairs had holes in them
1.0,Broke 20 minutes into wearing it.
1.0,Not as expected. Belts don‚Äôt hold up pants well after adjusting to where you want it
1.0,"The jacket is cute, but it is definitely not waterproof. It's not even water resistant. It very quickly absorbs any liquid that touches it.  Should not be marketed as a rain coat what so ever."
1.0,I‚Äôm usually a size 6 or medium and these shorts would not go past my knees LOL
1.0,Very cheap fabric and it keeps falling although I ordered the right size.
1.0,"I recently lost my pair of premier earrings and was happy to find them on Amazon, however the earrings arrived and are not the same nor do they even look like the image presented by premier. The earrings that arrived are more metallic and have a plastic feel."
1.0,"This is a portable/small but thin, lightweight, and flimsy umbrella. The first time I used it the wire-frame of the umbrella spokes was bent, and the plastic handle felt like it would break off with a gust of wind. It did not hold up to a strong gust."
1.0,"Love TNF own several jackets. Strange, This jacket sleeves are huge, and long way past my fingertips. How could sizing be that off? Doesn't TNF have quality control? ""Gotex"" Feels like a wet suit not comfortable. Had no choice returned."
1.0,I was so excited to get this dress to try it on so I knew whether or not I wanted to buy more styles/colors. I pulled it out of the bag and it had a big hole in the side and someone's else's deodorant marks on it. I didn't even want to put it on! I couldn't put it back in the bag fast enough!!!! How disappointing!!!!!
1.0,Runs super super super small.<br />It's ridiculous.
1.0,Bathing suit synthetic like icky material. Feel itchy. Fits tightly regardless of size. Doesn‚Äôt look anything like the photo
1.0,"Edit: April 15, 2021<br />Well, this watch did not last. It wasn't the case that was the problem, it was the knockoff quartz movement used. It started with the stop watch functionality failing. The buttons stopped working reliably and then the stop watch hands got even more out of whack than they had been. Then after about a month and a half of regular use, the time started to be off. Way off.  Now this could be a battery issue, but the watch was brand new and had a plastic stopper on the stem when I got it, so if it is a battery issue, then they put a bad battery in it at the factory.  Either way, the watch is now not really usable.  It's a shame that such an amazing looking watch that got me so many compliments was torpedoed by cheaping out on the movement. This watch goes from 5 stars to 1.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />One of the first gifts my wife gave me when we were dating was a wood watch. It held up surprisingly well until the crystal got cracked. I threw it out and have regretted it ever since. Upon seeing this watch by Arlsano, I was reminded of the one I‚Äôd tossed and decided I had to get it.<br /><br />Yesterday I decided to wear it to work where I spend most of my time interacting with customers. No less than three people commented on my watch, complimenting its appearance and style. I wear different watches fairly regularly and very rarely do people say anything. This watch got three compliments in one day! Astounding.<br /><br />The watch comes in a nice white box with gold foil embossing on it. The interior packing material is a block of foam with a cutout that the watch fits into with a smaller block inside the band. In the box is the watch, the watch manual and a plastic pin press for removing links from the watch band.<br /><br />The pin press was a nice surprise because I‚Äôve seen much more expensive watches than this one just include a metal pin driver that they expect you to use a hammer on.  This thing allows you to pop out the band pins with mechanical force. You put the band in, align the pin press and turn a screw. The mechanical force of the screw slowly drives the pin out. I can guarantee that this pin press will be used on more watches than just this one.<br /><br />On to the watch itself. With a case and band almost entirely made out of wood, this watch manages to have style as well as functionality. And seeing as it is made of wood, it‚Äôs ridiculously light! For those of use who usually wear big heavy metal watches, it‚Äôs a nice change.  It‚Äôs light enough to be almost unnoticeable when worn.<br /><br />This is not a thin watch, which isn‚Äôt surprising given that it‚Äôs made of wood. The watch case is among the thicker ones I own. The band is made of 5 columns of wooden links with some texture on two of the columns to give them definition. The clasp is a deployment style clasp, silver in color.<br /><br />The best thing about this watch other than its light weight is the watch face.  I like a lot of dials to balance out a design in a watch face as big as this one, and this one certainly has them. The watch has chronograph and date functions in addition to telling time.<br /><br />Including the main dial, there are three dials for the chronograph, counting milliseconds, seconds and minutes. On my watch the millisecond hand is about a second forward from the 0 position when at rest. Oddly enough, the image used in the listing also shows some of the hands out of position. This is definitely an issue that speaks to quality control.<br /><br />I love the design of this watch face. The combination of the dark blue background and the almost tan color metal pieces with white accents gives it an expensive classy look. This watch looks more expensive than it is and as a result is a head turner. You could put this watch face on a watch that costs three times as much and no-one would bat an eye. Combined with the nicely carved wooden case, it definitely stands out. My experience with 3 compliments on a single day testifies to that.<br /><br />The movement is quartz and it seems to keep reasonably accurate time. It‚Äôs a stem set watch and setting it is easy enough, though the date function gets a little fiddly with the knob not always wanting to stay in position as you turn it. Chronograph (Stopwatch) functions work reliably.  I have no idea if this watch is waterproof or not. Given that it‚Äôs wood, it‚Äôs probably best not to get it wet very often.<br /><br />On a last note, this watch was made in China, clearly. The manual does not say anything about waterproof ratings or a warranty (though it does contain a ‚ÄúThe Registration Form‚Äù and is filled with the usual poorly translated English.  It does, helpfully include information on setting the watch and how to use the pin press.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />I‚Äôm really impressed by this watch. At $50 (at time of writing), it‚Äôs not that expensive for a watch, but what you get for your money is a watch that will attract notice. It‚Äôs an attractive watch with a face design that makes it look like it has a better pedigree than it does. It does have at least one quality control issue in the hand placements and the manual lacks information about the waterproof rating and warranty. Neither of these issue would convince me not to want and use this watch, however. I love this watch. Seriously."
1.0,I bought a medium 34‚Äô length in three colors. And they are all different lengths. Only the navy blue pants are actually 34‚Äô length. So that‚Äôs annoying.
1.0,"This is horrible, itchy acrylic, not polyester. False information seems to be an increasing Amazon trend."
1.0,"Way too long and I accidentally ordered two! My return window closed so now I'm stuck with two... Don't order if you're 5'3 or shorter , it's too odd of a length . Nothing flattering about it."
1.0,"Nothing like the product shown.  Thin shirt, no distressed-look, funky armpit material (like spandex), and grey color, not black.  Keeping because I do not want to go through the return hassle.  Will probably use this shirt to lounge or work outside in.  Nothing special about it.  Could have purchased something just as ugly at Walmart. Would not buy again from this seller."
1.0,Don't waste your time ordering these. The gold finish rubs off almost instantly and they run very small
1.0,Was not explained that a battery back was needed and not provided to charge items. Scarves can‚Äôt be charged or heat produced without pack.  Totally useless.  Not happy and will not waste money on additional purchases necessaryüëéüèª
1.0,Material is way too thin! No way will I wear these to work out.
1.0,Liars it doesent come with a hoodie or poketsüò°
1.0,"Zero stars if they would let me. So many things wrong with these ""jogger pants"" I do not know where to begin. The pictures are definitely misleading.  At no time ever would I ever wear this item. The material used to make this thing has no business being associated with jogging or pants for that matter."
1.0,"Black, not silver. Couldnt figure out how to wear the crossover in back. Returning"
1.0,Cheap material. Not what I was expecting. Ordered a youth medium. It‚Äôs baggy.
1.0,Doesn't have a wire at the nose and sits too high on my nose and it has a pointed front like it's not made right and poufs out.
1.0,"The luggage set is pretty nice looking, but the bigger one lost a wheel at LAX at first trip..So do yourself a fever‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt buy it."
1.0,These eyeglass chains are made cheap. Two have broken already.
1.0,"The bra was extremely comfortable, fit well and stayed in place. The only problem was that it pushed my ‚Äúgirls‚Äù together so they stuck straight out like the 1980's Madonna metal bra. Did not like the way it made my body look."
1.0,Llego roto de atr√°s  y no lo puedo usar
1.0,"Cute rings but seems they run small in size. Other then that, we'll worth. Sweet. Received in great timing and will buy again from them"
1.0,It was cheap looking
1.0,"bought the watch because it looks beautiful, when it arrived, the box was damaged and falling apart, seems like a used one there were finger prints all over the watch and a noticeable scratch/ ding on the watch where it holds the straps. I did file for a replacement so we'll see how the replacement looks once it gets here."
1.0,Not even we‚Äôll made.  Crap crap crap
1.0,This dress has no lining - completely see through
1.0,"I couldn't dislike these pants more. There is zero tummy control--in fact they were quite opposite and I had to keep pulling the pants up because the waist just slid down. The pants were the right size, but they had no staying power"
1.0,"Super cheap!! They are so small, not durable at all. I never wore them"
1.0,Material look very cheap
1.0,The design is not screen printed. It was peeling off when I received it so i returned it. Cannot recommend this distributor. Truly disappointing.
1.0,"Initially I reviewed this as good because fit well and child liked, but within a week the toe area ripped from sole. Terribly made."
1.0,"Dictionary definition of ""minute"": 2. a sixtieth of a degree of angular measurement (symbol:  π). Well, that's what these so-called leg ""warmers"" are. They will fit you if you are a 4-6 year old girl or an Asian teenager. I have very slender legs and these were actually tight at top and bottom AND very short. No warmth, not cute! Returned immediately."
1.0,These sun glasses are nice looking but because they are rubber they do not fit on children's heads well. It's like they are completely stretched out. My daughter is four and they are too big for her head.
1.0,Liked the belt however it broke within a week. Had to return it.
1.0,These don't hold or last. The first shrug of shoulder or lift if arm they break
1.0,The slippers are way too small had to give them away to somebody with a smaller foot
1.0,Compre talla 12 y me quedo muy grande. El vestido es bonito.
1.0,The red looks more pink and it‚Äôs not dark enough The glass over the logo it‚Äôs foggy

1.0,Very thin swimsuit material. Not flattering.
1.0,Very cheap quality. Not even going to use it. Back to the drawing board.
1.0,atrocious. feels like thick sandpaper.
1.0,A little too tight for an average sized adult female. I use it mostly for a headband as its uncomfortable over my face.
1.0,I would give this 0 stars if I could.  It is very poorly made and the fabric is so thin you can see straight through it. You are throwing your money in the garbage by ordering this dress or anything else from this seller.
1.0,NOT flannel but a plastic-like synthetic.
1.0,Sorry to say that this particle watch was damaged when I received itüò¢
1.0,So uncomfortable.
1.0,"The gloves were soft and fairly warm for how thin they were which is what I wanted.  However, after wearing three times the end of the index finger came apart so mow they are useless and being returned."
1.0,The shirt is descent quality but cut two inches smaller than the same style shirt from other manufacturers.  I have several others from different makers and all are the same measurement  and fit well.  I ordered it because it was a few dollars cheaper than from other sellers- MY BAD!!!<br />Very Disappointed.
1.0,The suction cups are deformed so they don't form an effective seal and do not stick to the mirror as intended. Looks like they might have been deformed by heat.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the hair sticks to the bib and is hard to brush off.<br /><br />I will also note that the materials are overall very cheap. I think I'll just buy a proper barber's apron
1.0,"I purchased 2 of these rings to put one on each side of a solitaire that I also purchased.  I received my rings in just 2 days which was incredibly exciting.  However, I knew the second I put only one of these rings on that they would be going back.  I have never felt a ring be so uncomfortable.  The settings of the stones stuck up so high that when you put the ring on, it actually hurts to put your fingers together.  The picture on the description really didn't depict a good representation of the actual height of the settings.  It probably would have been OK had it not been an eternity ring with the settings all the way around the ring. Other than that, the rings were very beautiful.  The Asscher cut is really pretty.  However, I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase."
1.0,Bought it for Glinda‚Äôs wand in a Wizard of Oz production.  It broke the first performance.
1.0,"Turn colors,,not at all happy"
1.0,This ear rings look stunning however they broke the first night I wore them. The post bent and broke off completely. They are poorly made.
1.0,"This watch is listed as a automatic windi g movement, however it is a quartz watch. Buyer beware of misleading description."
1.0,Horrible has not formed to do with the photo
1.0,It‚Äôs not a good material it‚Äôs broken
1.0,This blouse smelled bad right out of the package. It had body odor
1.0,"Cute design, poor quality. Smelled terrible like chemicals right out of package. Everything from Liky Boutique is bad!!"
1.0,The letters are so small that you can‚Äôt read the words
1.0,"Lovely, but broke in half within a week. Soft metal."
1.0,I ordered an XL but the item might of said XL but it definitely wasn‚Äôt my daughter wears a small it fit her perfectly... don‚Äôt figure!!
1.0,These were smaller than advertised I sent them back but never received my refund
1.0,"If you want the fez pictured and described here, don't order this one. What you get instead is a very cheap, bright red, pseudo-felt fez edged in some sort of basting fabric with yellow cord and tassel.<br /><br />I even returned it, explaining the problem, and got the same thing as a replacement. Either no customer service, or they just don't care."
1.0,No idea why this description includes Galaxy in the name. It does not work with any samsung Galaxy watch which is what I thought I was buying. Seems like an ok band but doesn't fit my watch. Read the fineprint!
1.0,These earrings were SO disappointing! I ordered the 8mm ones and they are like 6mm or even smaller! soooo tiny! and I ordered a bunch of other stuff from them too and they were so awesome and also I could've compared them to these ones for size. SO tiny!
1.0,"I bought this same off-the-shoulder-shirt on another website. It was from ‚ÄúAwkward Styles,‚Äù same as this one. It was not even close on the sizing. I ordered a 2X, which should have fit loose. Instead, it was so small, I could barely get it on. Once I got it on, it was so tight, I had to struggle to take it off! It was easily a L or XL, yet labeled 2X. I really wanted to wear it to a holiday party. Sending it back. It‚Äôs cute and colorful, though."
1.0,"I loved this sweater!  BUT, I washed it once and the seam came undone all the way up my arm!  I was so disappointed."
1.0,This was very cheap and it came damaged around the collar. I am returning this item for a full refund. For some reason the system will not all me to submit a return. I hope I am not out of the cost of the items. Not happy with this at all.
1.0,It looks cute for a brief moment. The straps broke the first day. Sad face emoticon
1.0,Theses ear rings are pretty but to overwhelming for my earlobe. They are very big and pull downward.
1.0,"Cheap, awful, I do not recommend to anyone. Very disappointed. Can't tell what the initials are supposed to be. The edges are rough, not smooth. Bends like a piece of cheap metal."
1.0,Super cheap looking. It was a very thick chain and looked like a mister T necklace
1.0,Looks nothing like the photos and fits very small.
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to wear this belt for an hour. It broke in the Uber on the way to my event. I know it‚Äôs inexpensive, but I would have liked to have gotten one night of wear out of it."
1.0,This is  disgusting I received this dress inside out with make up all over it this was totally used not what I was expecting to receive I cannot believe this was marked as ‚Äúnew‚Äù when it certainly was not. I wish I could give this no stars
1.0,The elastic that goes around the ear is not well attached. Some were even  detatched in the package. I needed the masks so I glued the elastic to the mask with Elmers.  It holds the elastic in place nicely when given a day or so to cure.
1.0,"The soft interior material is only at the ankle and did not appeal to my nephew who has sensory issues.  We were able to find pants for him that had smooth, soft material lining the entire garment, allowing him to wear the pants without feeling the rough side of the material on his legs.  I was disappointed that the image shows a soft, dimpled lining, only to find out that is apparently just for asthetics and doesn't line the inside of the pants."
1.0,This shirt is gross. Shame on you. Supporting Yulin Fest etc. NO ONE BUY THIS DISGUSTING SHIRT
1.0,I ordered XL and I wear a Medium - but everything sent from China is way to small.  No way to send it back and took 2 months to arrive.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY<br /><br />These socks are terrible.  When you out them on, and the socks stretch, all you see is white.  Its as if these have been spray painted.  Total rip off.  Unfortunately they were a gift from my wife who purchased early for Christmas and is unable to reject and claim refund.  So, the worst quality with a ridiculous price.  THEY OWE MY WIFE A REFUND"
1.0,Bought a second one (purple) right after receiving the first sweater (bear). The color is pretty but the quality is bad‚Äîthe sleeves are broken as the picture shows. Really disappointed.
1.0,They are WAY smaller than 34&#34;
1.0,"Thr material was to thin, using it for church with air condition on high."
1.0,I purchased this skirt. I really like it but it is so tight around my waste. I wear large but purchased XL. I think it is a great skirt but the waist is off.
1.0,Way to big all over
1.0,"No me gusto , muy mala calidad!"
1.0,Produced a rash on my wrist and neck
1.0,It looks nothing like the PICTURE very disappointed its CHEAP LOOKING DONT BUY THIS
1.0,I wish I could give it zero stars. Came super knotted. And it looks higher quality on the picture then it actually is. I sent it right back and said screw it
1.0,"You get what you pay for. They look like other Old West boots, but they have man- made top and bottom, thin, cheap, barely qualifies as ‚Äúleather‚Äù. It‚Äôs too bad no one thinks kids need good stuff, too. Wouldn‚Äôt last a little cowboy any time at all. Sent back."
1.0,Now way item was a 5X
1.0,"This shirt is nothing like the picture. Horrible fit, not long as pictured."
1.0,"Good compression, but the toe seam is so uncomfortable I had to take them off. And the pattern made it impossible to wear inside out."
1.0,Missing one earring which I was willing to overlook and when I tried to screw one in it screwed through and popped the stone out (using my hands). I was able to return for a full refund.
1.0,Hat poorly made. Came crushed inside the box. Will be returning it...üëéüëé
1.0,"The color of the top was totally different that the skirt, and didn't match any of the colors in the skirt.  Wouldn't recommend this color"
1.0,This mask is NOTHING like advertised. This seller is selling false mask make.  There is no bling or glitter at all just  a cloth mask. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!
1.0,"I‚Äôve bought plenty of cheap rings off amazon at similar price points and this one is the worst. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even metal, it‚Äôs lumpy and too big and doesn‚Äôt look like the pictures. I could get a nicer ring out of a gum ball machine"
1.0,"I loved the design, but it cracked/ripped across within a month so it didn't even last until my vacation, which was the whole reason I bought it."
1.0,This dress fit nothing like I thought it would. I returned this because I could not wear it at all.
1.0,Worst purchase so far and I really liked them.  9 received and down to only 4 because they kept falling ooff and getting lost. Found some of pieces.  Not even giving them 1 star.
1.0,"There is NO Opening on this Bodysuit for you to put it on. I suppose you are to pull it on through the unstretchable neckline... Cut Outfit, maybe I just one that was messed up. And the Leggings were sewed onto the bodysuit????"
1.0,We like the fit but after the second time of wearing it the picture ripped in half and the letters peeled off. The hoodie hasn‚Äôt been washed yet and it‚Äôs coming apart. Please don‚Äôt purchase this hoodie.
1.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt buy this for $2 at a thrift store.  Winter be leaving the house in it.  Tacky fit - straight down, no contour on waistline, shabby fabric, cheap printing.  My 7 year old neighbor girl would say it looks trashy.  Impressive miracle worker shot the photos‚Ä¶made a silk purse out of an ear no self respecting sow would admit to being hers‚Ä¶felt cheated; vendor should be ashamed of themselves.  I don‚Äôt usually write negative reviews, but this was an EXCEPTIONALLY BAD PRODUCT.  The best tailor couldn‚Äôt salvage this mess, fit is NOT the problem (but it‚Äôs a factor).  AWFUL!  Embarrassed to donate, into the dumpster is the only thing to salvage this problem."
1.0,No it had a big cut on the side so unhappy
1.0,Too big gave away
1.0,"I really liked this pair of glasses. Looked good, fit well.  Then out of nowhere, I mean I was sitting up l hear a snap and the bottom of the left frame breaks from the lens from literally nothing! So so disappointed!"
1.0,I ordered my package October 10th and it said it was going to arrive 22nd but it has yet to arrive and it is now the 26th.. I need my consume soon and it gave me no warning before hand that it would take this long to arrive. Then I was checking on my order and it completely disappeared from my orders list.. my money is still gone and not my order disappeared. I would not recommend this costume! It‚Äôs is very expensive and not worth the money!
1.0,Tried to return this item because it was very small.  It turns out that I am expected to pay postage. The amount of postage ranged from $17.95 to $109.00.  The item only cost $24.00!!!
1.0,"I really liked it, looked nice on, got to work and within an hour it broke at the clasp, not sure how it can be fixed"
1.0,Broke before I could get it on watch üò°
1.0,"I was trying to buy what I thought was a similar top to another ribbed tank that I received from Amazon. This one was not even close. The fabric is pretty thin, and after one wash, it shrunk and threads were coming out everywhere. I knew that this wasn't exactly high quality, but I expected better."
1.0,What a waste of money. You cannot even separate the tape to use it. If I hadn't already shelled out about $20 to buy it and get it delivered quick I would return it. Instead I'll just throw it away. Don't waste your money!
1.0,"It doesn‚Äôt look real, doesn‚Äôt feel good on, and there were little stones missing, but for the price I didn‚Äôt expect much."
1.0,"Cheap, shiny material, returning!"
1.0,"This was one of the worst items I have ever ordered.  From experience I know to order large, so I ordered an XXL and I'll be surprised if it first my size 5 daughter.  I won't waste my money sending it back, but I have come to expect a better quality product from Amazon.  Buyer beware!"
1.0,Runs small and not loose fitting as featured
1.0,They send a tool to adjust band size but ZERO directions on how to use it!  And now after two weeks the hour hand does not line up on the correct spot.  Do NOT buy!
1.0,"Fits on shoulders and chest. Waist is too big, not form fitting"
1.0,"Every mask smells like gasoline, it is impossible to breathe with the smell, I had to remove it right away, don't buy this"
1.0,"Dont waste your money and time.<br /><br />I initially rated it 5 stars, until pieces of metal became loose in the dial and I had to return it. I got a second one. The second one doesnt keep time for more than a few hours even with spring fully wound and ok an automatic winder. Plust the second hand doesnt move smoothly and gets stuck at 3, 4, and 5, and then jumps as if its getting stuck.... VERY VERY POOR QUALITY YOU WILL END UP RETURNING<br /><br />Edit: No longer able to even set time. When you pull the pin out to the second setting it no longer turns, feels like the teeth are slipping.......<br /><br />Edit Edit: NO LONGER WORKS! ONLY 3 MONTHS LATER :O"
1.0,If i only had one foot all would be well. But this does not make sense.  These shoild be sold in pairs<br />Ridiculous
1.0,Thought the dress would be a little oversized. Material is made of some sort of spandex and does not have enough stretch.
1.0,"Super cute dress but i could tell immediately that I‚Äôd maybe get 3 wears out of it before it fell apart. Welp, I got 1 wear before a hole began to form in the side at the seam. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
1.0,"Worse rings to buy. We got these for our kids bdays and I tried one on, shortly after I got an allergic reaction! I've tried on many mood rings before and this was the first time I've EVER had a reaction like this. I was scared to let my kids wear them in fear they would get the same reaction- cause its painful! Not even the packaging was nice. Only 4 boxes came and one of the had the 5th ring stuffed in the same box! DO NOT BUY THESE RINGS!"
1.0,They cut a cheap t shirt with scissors and are trying to pass it off as a nicely designed tank. PASS!
1.0,I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend and he‚Äôs not even gonna be able to wear it due to low quality zipper and bad design.
1.0,"Product is made terribly. Horrendous printing job and the words all have errors like the peeling. Shirt fits awkward and is boxy. Definitely runs large. Just overall a highly disappointing shirt. Words are too big and like I said, already peeled the first time wearing it for less than an hour. Annoying. Don‚Äôt buy it. Material is super cheap"
1.0,These are the worst I've ever tried. Small size is teeny -- for kids' shoes -- not for heels as suggested. I cleaned my soles and the sticky side stuck great; too bad the grip paper didn't stay on the other sticky side! Slid right off into a roll and I couldn't unroll it and stick it back on. Had to chuck both pairs.
1.0,Very poorly made. Awkward fit. Doesn‚Äôt fit anyone face properly. Just ugly. Save your money.
1.0,I loved how they looked but putting the screw back on irritated my ear lobe so much I couldn‚Äôt wear earrings for several days. Had to return them.
1.0,Beware these run really small in size. I sent mine back.
1.0,This product fits but it is too short. Not a mini dress. Length is AT mid butt. Long enough to be worn as a top.
1.0,"The strap is very light, also since the watch is a little lose the strap makes noise like I'm carrying around cheap metal. The design is nice, but the feel is not. I guess you get what u paid for, for $16 it's not bad but definitely had better expectations."
1.0,"Waste of money!! The clasp was on backwards, the leather stamp was stamped on top of the band, which should of been on the bottom. It looks super cheap. I was sent the wrong color I think or their rose gold looks gold. I would not recommend at all."
1.0,not what i expected too small and cheap
1.0,The leather had a weird smell and got kind of green/moldy looking after a little while. This is not a quality leather bag.
1.0,"Not cotton, too shiny, very wide, not much length, weird material bought a medium for my son, he‚Äôs not going to wear it .  Cheap fabric"
1.0,"HORRIBLE!! Nothing at all like the description! Worst piece of clothing i have ever bought in my lfe! The stitching is awful and coming apart everywhere. The front is way shorter than the back, not even the same color or fabric as advertised. Looks nothing at all like the picture.  Horrible fit.. the arms are way too short and the sweater fits like a garbage bag. A 5 year old child could make a sweater better than this... the stitching is awful and coming apart everywhere. Do not order this, you will be very disapointed"
1.0,Boots would have been great had they not shown up in this condition. It looks like they‚Äôre used. Scuffs and dirt on the insides of both shoes. :(
1.0,"These are basically pajamas. Will last about 10 wears/washes until it shrinks, pills and fades."
1.0,Very disappointed in these. We bought them for at a water park we went too and they were shredding and coming apart after an hour. The inserts came out and I basically threw them away. Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,Didn't fit right to lie on shoulders feel exposed
1.0,Sizing is way way off
1.0,Looks nothing like what's expected. Not at all satisfied.
1.0,"Multiple reviews indicated the shirt is a true fit to size. This information was false in my case.  Once the shirt arrived, visually I could tell the size was too small. The material was also harsh to the touch. If you are ordering this shirt I would recommend sizing up."
1.0,"Not like pictures and there's change in color<br />I ordered grey,,, and comes in black color"
1.0,BUYER BEWARE!!!! I wore this chain for the first time and it left a trail of bumps where it was in contact with my skin. You can literally see the outline of the chain around my neck.
1.0,"I loved the item but it stunk so bad that I couldn‚Äôt wear it!  I didn‚Äôt notice the smell until it hung in my closet for a day.  I washed it once and it still stunk.  I‚Äôm washing again and will see if the smell is gone.  If not, I‚Äôm stuck with it as it‚Äôs now considered worn!  I will make sure in the future that any clothing items I order will be smell checked before I consider keeping them.  Very, very disappointed."
1.0,Thin and NO support
1.0,"Very thin material, it is completely see through. You can't wear ANYTHING underneath, but at the same time you absolutely need to wear something underneath."
1.0,This cover up is not flattering at all because it has no shape. Looks like a hospital gown. Low quality material.
1.0,If I could return it I would it was complicated to return
1.0,False advertising; the item was not long and baggy like the pictures; I purchased two sizes up and it was still short and tight! Don't purchase
1.0,Very poor quality. My five-year-old received this as a Christmas present & she was very excited to wear it . The first (and only) time she wore it the shirt begin shedding all of the silver sparkles all over the house leaving behind yellow spots that made the shirt on wearable. Then she sat down Indian style in the crotch ripped out. Overpriced with poor quality.
1.0,slight discoloration that easily noticed
1.0,It came with alot but jewelry tarnished after 1 day of washing my hands lol. And my neck turned very green
1.0,"I have ordered and purchased the same size and same product countless times over the past 15 years - supposedly high waist cotton panties from JMS. There is no consistency in the product so I can only assume they are being made in various other countries and apparently they haven't given them patterns and standards. Sometimes they fit just fine, other times they are too small. Sometimes the elastic is not tight enough so even though the panty is too snug, the elastic is very loose and doesn't stay up.  Up until about 8-10 years ago the panties were consistent and honestly, now the ancient ones I have in a smaller size from 15 years ago fit and wear better than the larger size I started buying when new ones were too snug. The best ones were back when they ""actually"" had a high waist, the waistband was wider, with wider elastic and read JMS in italics across the band and the elastic on the legs was not fabric covered.  The order I received prior to this latest one the panties fit, but then once again the latest order they were too small and slip down in front and back every time I sit or walk. Very hit or miss product!"
1.0,Don‚Äôt like the metal.
1.0,"Have no idea, bought for a gift."
1.0,They broke.  Not much wax on the laces either. They‚Äôre only shoe laces but they need to work and these didn‚Äôt.
1.0,Turns easily ! Not durable
1.0,Very cheap. Not worth 1.00.
1.0,When I go for my long biking or walking adventures I drink a lot of water. These shorts are not MALE friendly. Enough said...
1.0,Nothing like the picture... Looks like kid jewelry from a gum ball machine!
1.0,"Extremely disappointed in these. I purchased them last year in a mixed color pack (white, grey and black) and they fit great, the size was perfect and they were flexible. I purchased using the same link and chose all black instead and they came with torn sewing on top of being sewn unevenly and definitely not the same size/ material as before."
1.0,Piece of junk! Broke in two places after wearing once for a few hours!
1.0,Horrible returning! They didn‚Äôt fit on min husbands or moms head!!  Super flimsy sending them back
1.0,"The material, faux leather, is too stiff, it hurt my ankles, I had to return them."
1.0,"I originally posted that I loved this, and it is beautiful.  However, it broke within the firs two weeks with minimal use. Broke in two places, first the elephant separated from the rest of the chain, then the middle piece came off.  The actual metal broke."
1.0,"I loved this bra so I ordered 3.  The other two were great but, This one all in black IS THE WRONG BRA and it runs horribly small.  Return started. As you can see in pic, the bra they sent is not the cross-cross like what I ordered - the straps make a basket weave pattern.  This is all fine and I would have just kept it- but the same size that fit in the regular criss cross, is two sizes too small in this bra.  To me that indicates poor quality control.  But now I have to deal with going to UPS to make this return."
1.0,Only half of them actually worked. I  had to sit and go through each one and throw away half of them. Very disappointing.
1.0,"But the noses and mouths are twice the size of any human being. If you are looking for realism, don't bother."
1.0,"Huge on my face and totally unwearable, but it's kinda cute. It's a lot more loud than I expected it to be, but if you're into big CZs this is totally for you."
1.0,Cheapl material.  Didn‚Äôt even wear ot.
1.0,"I am very angry about this T. I love this brand's regular t-shirts and have had no issues with them. However, this shirt, after a half dozen washings, went from burnout to COMPLETELY see-through. The fabric seems to barely exist, its so thin! I dont know what process it is they use to create their burnout t's, but I have never had this happen to a t shirt before. Of course, the return window on this item is now closed, but if there is any way I could return it, I most certainly would because it is completely defective by my standards."
1.0,Extremely low quality.  I've got small hands and my fingers barely fit through the finger parts.  There's sloppily placed glue everywhere.  The fingers are partially glued to the palm areas making it impossible to fully open your hand without tearing them.  They feel like they're going to fall apart immediately.  The photos were taken seconds after opening the package.
1.0,These are poorly made and took forever to ship. The mask has splotches of light and dark colors and smells horrible.
1.0,"These bands are just TOOOOOOO huge for the average wrist. I suggest the offer a S/M size option. Other than that, awesome, but uncomfortably too long. As a result, it now lives in my ‚Äúwould‚Äôve been nice‚Äù draw."
1.0,Awesome but waaay to small.
1.0,not as seen here color is different
1.0,cheap and tarnished!
1.0,Cute bracelet but not a good quality. It broke after wearing it once.
1.0,"I bought this for my 10 years old because the description is for boys/girls child watch.  It's so big.  It's a size for a man.  Even for a woman, it's too big."
1.0,It fits great but it's so short ! Can't move in it without my area showing
1.0,This fabric is cheap and rough and arrived to me with ripped seams and stetched out. Boo!
1.0,The pin in the watch band was missing and I had to fix it myself
1.0,"Not a fan, hard to open/close and an odd size."
1.0,short band
1.0,"Cheaply made, plastic stinky, returned"
1.0,I loved the items but both had holes and snares to visible to wear.
1.0,THEY SUCK THE WRIST BAND OR SMALL EVEN IF YOU HAVE AVERAGE  SIZE HAND STILL WILL BE A TIGHT FIT
1.0,"Looks cheap. The sweatshirt is really boxy, but mostly the zipper is cheap looking and the arms are short."
1.0,Too light weight and this have no balance. Earrings stick out in an unattractive awkward manner
1.0,"I loved this, but it didn't last 30 days.  I guess you get what you pay for as it fell apart."
1.0,One of the eye holes on the cap was not stitched.
1.0,just use a rubber band. It'll be about as effective.
1.0,too large and color fades
1.0,It hardly works. I tried it on two different rfid locks. One doesn‚Äôt take at at all and the other opens one out of every ten tries or so.
1.0,Over sized And not as cute as in the picture
1.0,"I was so excited because I got this shirt, it was so soft and cute but I didn‚Äôt even get to wear it because when it was folded up the lettering got stuck like this and peeled off. :("
1.0,"I bought a petite size for my Mom who is 5‚Äù1‚Äô when arrived I held them up to my waist and leg hit the top of my shoe, I am almost 5‚Äù8‚Äô. I am returning."
1.0,"Not a robust product at all - purchased for my daughter to give to her friend, it was broken within hours even though all she'd done was put it on and wear it - disappointing."
1.0,Most of the lights were either turned on when I opened package or broken already.... ie batteries fallen out and/or lens fallen off.  I would not purchase again
1.0,Zipper broke in 40 days.  Nice coat.  Poor quality.
1.0,"this is now my second pair that I purchased because the other broke 2 days after buying mainly my fault. I ordered another bc they fit well they weren't flimsy or falling off my face and I originally gave a 4 star review. Just got my new pair and they are SO cheap, barely stay on my face, are soooo loose! Terrible!!!!! waste of money. Don't make my same mistake in ordering these cheap glasses. Also gonna add the ear pieces are heavy and make your ears hurt after wearing for an hour or so."
1.0,This is not a sleeveless dress as described
1.0,"The socks are nice and thick, but there is a manufacturing defect on the right sock. There is an area where the yarn used for the pattern and color is not there, and it's just the see through base knitting. So I can see my foot through the sock. I know that manufacturing is outside of the control of the seller, but I would like a replacement pair."
1.0,"I loved this band, but after having it on for a few hours, it turned my skin green. I painted some clear nail polish on the inside to see if I could continue to wear it - this helped with the issue of green skin for about a day and a half. The pictures of the band here are just after three and a half days of use. The band itself is turning bronze. I‚Äôm very disappointed."
1.0,The band is the wrong size for the Swatch and the discrepancy was not evident from the information provided when ordering.
1.0,Not good at all you can‚Äôt see or breathe in mask like someone just didn‚Äôt care when making this mask
1.0,"Poor quality, thin like tissue paper okay for a one time event. Tore up in the washer"
1.0,Wire popped threw after a week. I did not even wash it in a washer.
1.0,"This product does not work right.  The sensor does not work, so you have to push the button on the head for it to work.  The suction cup is also not very strong.  this is now sitting in the bottom of my Halloween tub and will probably never be used again:(<br />Waste of money."
1.0,"I ordered this in an XL, I'm actually currently 7 months pregnant and thought it might look cute with the rushing.  I normally wear an XL and when this came in I put it on and it was ENORMOUS on me.  Wondering if that was just supposed to be the style (even at 7 months pregnant it was so big the rushing didn't even show, just hung down low on my legs), I decided I'd order a Large to compare.  That came in SKIN TIGHT!  I'm guessing their sizing is completely arbitrary, I returned both for a refund and wouldn't recommend wasting your time."
1.0,After inserting them in my shoes I couldn't even get the shoes on. Waste of money.
1.0,"Just nope. I ordered a 3x. I have a 30‚Äì30.5‚Äù waist. My hips are ample but it‚Äôs a full-skirted dress. My top is a general 38C bust with pretty thick upper arms but not linebacker arms.<br /><br />I wear a 12 (sometimes a 10) in jeans and a large top (depending on the style -<br />Medium works but if sleeves need a large.<br /><br />I ordered THE largest size. 3x, based on my actual measurements. I couldn‚Äôt button it up. It was so silly and ridiculous. And then I went to return it and I was refunded but they didn‚Äôt even want the dress back so it was donated. Sizing is clearly not US or UK standard. And measurements did not match in my experience.<br /><br />The fabric and construction was mediocre. Not substantial or particularly well made. Buttons look cheap."
1.0,Too short on the ankle and too thin.
1.0,"Cute and comfy, BUT the fur wore off (where the toes are) after wearing them for less than a week. I don't really like the soles either- everything sticks to the bottom of them."
1.0,"When I put these on my feet, I purred with pleasure; felt as walking on a cloud. Then the unexpected happened, they fell apart in less than a week - the stitching came away from the soul. I expected a better product from Dearfoams. Maybe a bad batch?"
1.0,Poorly made. The design was coming up on the edges all over.  For some reason the bust is made incredibly wrong. And i can't forget how the bust pads could probably only hold pair of lines lemon...then they both are sewn almost dead center. Very very bad
1.0,"I bought 2 with 2 freebies on their website.  Total cost was $51.00.  Seems that shipping and handling is over $15 per single set.  But they don't give you a final price until they process your credit card.  As to the quality of product, not worth the original $10.  The peephole is so small you can't get a clear view.  Stay away from this outfit and their products."
1.0,Material too thin in seat.  Worry underwear will show through.
1.0,"Cons: Very thin. Runs larger than expected. Feels very silky but it's not made of silk. The neck hole isn't even hemmed. It looks like they cute out the shape of a body suit, sewed some of it together and added buttons. The printing on it feels like an iron on patch that will come off in the drier. (I'll update this after I wash and dry). There aren't care instructions on the tag or a size on it. The legs are extremely short compared to the torso. I bought this thinking it would be a good winter outfit but I think it would be better for summer and spring. There are lose strings 4inches long on the leg hems.<br /><br />Pros: pretty color, the saying is kind of funny even though I don't know what &#34;rags&#34; means. Cheap.<br /><br />Sorry about the poor quality of photos, my daughter was napping on my chest. I finally got help from my 4 1/2 yr old son lol<br /><br />****update after washing and drying. Originally gave 3 stars. Dropped to 1 star. The white saying has cracks in it and some of it is coming off."
1.0,Every one of the bracelets were broken in several pieces on arrival. I managed to put one back together well enough to serve my original purpose as a gift. the others sit in a bag waiting for me to have time to try and rescue them.
1.0,Sewn poorly. Itchy nylon thread. Fits small. Returned and won't buy brand again.
1.0,"Wore them for 5 minutes, took them off, and the plastic part on the side frame had come off. Now whenever I take them off they pull my hair. Was really disappointed as the fit was great I loved the box and sleeve they came in."
1.0,I was expecting these socks to have extra cushioning in the ball of the foot area. There wasn't any which makes them not useful for outdoor sports. I think the product description was very misleading.
1.0,"Muy buen material, pero el sello izquierdo de la parte delantera no lo tiene.. nose si es un modelo nuevo por que lo trae detr√°s, del resto bien"
1.0,Very poor quality. Unable to sell as I don't want my name associated with this product!
1.0,"The item that arrived does not look at all like the picture. The fabric is different, the fit is completely wrong."
1.0,I washed this product before use and it still dyed my body and hands blue!  The blue also bled onto the white stripes making them now a light blue.  Such a shame as it fits nicely and is comfy.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6b68396eaf2cefbbd8fd5e8206d7990a]] Wth it says 60 peices and I got 10?!
1.0,Honestly this is a piece of garbage. I barely got it open and could not click it closed back even with pliers. I'm just eating the cost because I'm not sending something back that has my body germs on it.
1.0,Not Happy! The description specifically said 3 pairs and I received one.
1.0,was very disappointed in the size of this and after a week it became discolored.
1.0,Extremely larger than expected
1.0,"Cheap material, looks nothing like the picture, horrible return policy - you have to send it yourself back to China. Will update my review if the seller actually assists with returning it..."
1.0,"Took a chance on this even though it had zero reviews because it looked so cute, thought it would be perfect for a casual summer wedding. But nope. It‚Äôs pretty awful - material is cheap looking and feeling so it doesn‚Äôt fall nicely, it kinda clings like cheap spandex-y material, the skirt is not full as it appears in the pic, and the print isn‚Äôt even exactly the same as the pic. It looks like something I bought at Five Below. You know the knock off cartoon character merchandise that kinda sorta look like the real thing if you squint? That‚Äôs this dress :/"
1.0,"This shirt smells so bad! Reminds me of my great grandmother‚Äôs house. I have washed it  3 times and it doesn‚Äôt go away! I put it in my closet at one point, hoping it would fade with time, but instead it spread it‚Äôs awefulness to the sweater on either side of it.  Horrible! I‚Äôve never even gotten to try it on. It will be going in the trash."
1.0,"I own many leggings of this brand they have all been great, unfortunately these fleece ran quite small and are very uncomfortable."
1.0,I bought this top in a large... One of the armholes is large and the other is a medium...these people should check over their clothes before sending out to costumers.
1.0,"This dress looks really cute if you are built exactly like the model in the picture.  If not, it makes you look matronly.  I'm 5'7"" and 150 lbs and it was not flattering."
1.0,If I could give it zero stars I would. I literally sliced through the glove the first time I used it. Total waste of money.
1.0,"My 6 year old has a very hard time finding shoes that fit and don't hurt her feet. So, when I received these and she loved them, I was ecstatic! They were very cute!<br /><br />However, after only about a week of wearing them, the bow has fallen off one of them! I am very sad about the quality of the shoes. They were never worn outside!<br /><br />I would not recommend them unless you only need a handful of times."
1.0,These are not sized truthfully.  I ordered 2 sizes bigger than what I wear and it is too small.
1.0,Cannot use.  Ordered navy blue not cobalt blue.
1.0,Did not like the yellow lens.  Made everything look weird.  Returned item.
1.0,This is a complete joke they don‚Äôt fit
1.0,It was WAY to small.  The inside of the top part of the dress was almost like cardboard on the inside.
1.0,The side holes pictured above are not open they are sown closed. So you can not get them buttoned on the side. Why would they not be open? Also. I had to put the shoulder metal clasps on the pair of overalls. I have never bought a pair of overalls that I had to do that.
1.0,"Loved these bags til I washed them and ties break, useless after a wash"
1.0,This product is so cheaply made they the feathers feel off the wings before trick or treating happened.
1.0,"If you want to show everyone your undergarments, this is the dress for you."
1.0,I loved it.  The metal or plastic beads made my skin turned green. I used it with my Fitbit Charge 2
1.0,Mala calidad üòî
1.0,"The material is super see through. I could see them being used as leggings under a dress or something, but they definitely don‚Äôt pass the gym requirements- too cheeky cheeky! Also, I‚Äôd size up if you really do want to get them, not much give to the material."
1.0,This swimsuit runs small which is too bad because the Pur colored one is really pretty. I ordered an XXL since I'm a size 18. The top part was perfect for a B cup but the bottom portion starting right under the bust was really tight.
1.0,??? I want to give 0 rate.
1.0,Does not fit iPhone 6/6s. I don‚Äôt understand why I must pay to return this item.
1.0,Completely see through :(
1.0,Too smaaaaal! This is not XL size! Maybe M!
1.0,Only received 1of each clip very disappointed.
1.0,This is way smaller than standard sizing. My grand daughter fit the xl that I got for another person √†nd I gave away the medium that was way smaller than other mediums.
1.0,"The leather in this band is extremely brittle,  broke afret 45 days.  thus very poor quality. Would not buy this again."
1.0,Not made for women with big shins
1.0,"This was trash right out of the bag. It runs about two sizes to three sizes small. It‚Äôs almost completely see-through which would be OK if that‚Äôs what you expected but it‚Äôs made to look like silk in the photos. That brings us to the next issue this is not silk or anything close to it, it‚Äôs itchy there are threads hanging out and it has no stretch."
1.0,"This was a disappointing, cheap product that did not hold my watch.  Two of the posts were broken on arrival,  the 3rd broke within 1/2 of putting it on my watch.  I nearly lost a my watch and I'll go to a jewler instead."
1.0,One wash and it looks like it's been through a hundred times.
1.0,Was like a trash bag. Only had one pocket.<br />My son wore it once and threw it in the trash
1.0,It fit too small and bought the largest size. I normally wear a medium and bought a XL. And when got it on one of the straps tore in half. Very disappointing!!
1.0,Material looks real cheap!
1.0,Very see through and the fit was too small. It also arrived very wrinkly. Returned this item.
1.0,Not exactly what it appears. This is not an off the shoulder top.
1.0,"Not a good fit for a muscle tank it‚Äôs short and wide I‚Äôm 5,8 160 pounds and this think looked like I had on the dress of a small child"
1.0,"The product was supposed to be white, when I opened it up, the fur was pink"
1.0,Way to small and poor quality fabric seetrue
1.0,Too tight for a M
1.0,Cheap cheap feel. Strings coming out all over it. Stain on the front.
1.0,For them to have  been listed as new they were dirty; I will be returning them.
1.0,"cheesey,...from china."
1.0,Very cheap material. After the1st wash its not good anymore. Falling apart after the 1st wash.
1.0,Pesimo servicio cancele 2 prendas y mi rembolso no lo obtuve nunca
1.0,"The material was terrible and it was too small, I've wear an XL and have been for over 20 years. The XL was too small and the XXL was too small. Don't buy this product. No though was put into making this item"
1.0,"To big and gaudy, chain is way too small!  It looks dainty and cute in the pictures, but, when you get, your in for a shock!  I sent it back ASAP!  Looks like something your great Grandmother would wear!"
1.0,They broke... After four wears
1.0,I‚Äôm sending this back. The material is too thin. It is not at all what I expected.
1.0,"I don't understand how these got a good rating. Mine actually snapped, poor quality and barley glows in the dark after MUCH light exposure."
1.0,Thought i was getting 1 1/38 got 1 1/14 too thin sending back
1.0,"I expected a 1-star product as the reviews showed and they delivered as expected. The item description mentioned they run small and to order 1-2 sizes up. They were in fact pretty true to size, so now I'm stuck with 2 sizes too big.<br />Also, the description mentioned mesh liner. The liner is not at all mesh but more like spandex bike shorts. The outer layer is lightweight material and feels like it would be fast drying. The color is purple and by the photo shown I assumed I was looking at black shorts. Was caught off guard by the plumb color when the shorts arrived.<br />I guess I got what I paid for. I would've been better off to just spend a few extra dollars and bought from a more reputable seller."
1.0,Poor quality will return
1.0,Do not buy. Came with only one sleeve on it. Not joking at all. What a rip off!!!
1.0,Bought a 2xl and it looks like its a medium. Not happy at all
1.0,I did not like that the pieces do not fit together. Post doesn't go into backing.
1.0,"The size isn‚Äôt even my issue with this dress. Even if it had fit perfectly, IT IS ENTIRELY SEE THROUGH. I can‚Äôt even post a picture here, you can see every inch of my body through this dress. I bought a yellow dress, size small."
1.0,To thin. It fell apart after 2 hours at work.
1.0,"Son hermosos pero de muy mala calidad, con pocos d√≠as de uso cambiaron de color, perdieron el color dorado"
1.0,"runs slow, not worth the money to get a new battery."
1.0,"Its blue not olive, very cheap, not low cut like pkcture, more like a v crew neck, horrible"
1.0,Way to small but it was beautiful
1.0,Has nothing to do with thw picture. Its a really ugly dress never again will I buy clothes from Amazon.
1.0,Bad deal...we have to unhook them to get the shoes on...keep laces and your cash...
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt the color I expected and looked used. But It fit as expected .
1.0,"Very cute in the picture, but in person fabric is cheap and WAY too small.<br />I'm 5'0 and fit more like a shirt than a cover up. And I have pretty large breast who couldn't breathe in this cover up lol... Don't recommend it at all unless it's for a child."
1.0,So colorful I was so hopeful and wanted this to work. It has no stretch at all and not a breathable material... unfortunately I had to return as I knew there was no way I‚Äôd last an entire beach wedding in it
1.0,Returned. Not feminine at all. Doesn‚Äôt fit or look like picture on model.
1.0,Clip for shoulder strap broke on 4th day of use. Luckily my laptop didn't break when the bag hit the concrete!
1.0,Do not purchase this item! It does not follow even their own manufactured listed sizes!!! It is not a full length dress and if you need to return please know you are paying more to ship to Singapore! Asian clothes are amazing but if they are going to use the size different as an excuse they need to state that in their definition of the product. False advertising at its finest.
1.0,Wrong size sent can't even wear them way to small
1.0,Returned. Material thinner than expected
1.0,"Not even a leather band, more like pleather"
1.0,"I've worn these for a month and a half now and the front end of the sole has started to peel off. These are some nice looking boots, but I don't think they were made for actual use. Even before they start to fall apart they won't really do much to keep snow out either. After having and inch of the sole peel off I had to repair them with super glue...yes super glue. I'd recommend going with another brand, Timberland really cheaped out on the production of these. That is unless you're only going to wear them one night and only one night, then they might be perfect. If you are persuaded by all the positive reviewers who submitted reviews after trying them on in their living room THEN AT LEAST MAKE SURE YOU BUY SOME SUPER GLUE."
1.0,"The description says ""one size"" which means at least a large shirt.  The tag on the shirt says medium.  It is too small to fit most.  The shirt is thin and not very good quality.  It is disappointing because the picture of the shirt is adorable!"
1.0,"Had to return. WAY too small. Reviews said that so I ordered larger and still tiny.<br /><br />I'm between a 4 and a 6 (typically a 4 if there is any give). I ordered an 8, and it fit my daughter who is a 00. I had no chance of getting it on.<br /><br />It's stupid cute (really cute) but I doubt I could get I'm the largest size."
1.0,"I have this dress in 5-6 prints.<br />This review is for blue with pink floral.<br />This one seems cheap and the quality is obvious because you can see through it (even though it is royal blue with flowers).<br />I wore it to work and had people tell me you can see my legs/thighs through it, and see my bra.<br />One issue is the  material is thin and white underneath, so when fabric stretches - even a little - it looks white and see through.<br />It also doesn‚Äôt fit the same as the others. It is a couple inches shorter and doesn‚Äôt fit as well under the waist seam. So it is not as flattering as the others.<br />I wore this part of the day so far and it looks pillled. Partially because of the white under side of fabric. And because it actually is pilling after only 3/4 a work day.<br />I plan to contact company. I have spent a lot of money with them on the many dresses. And feel I should get my money back. Definitely a disappointment."
1.0,The his can‚Äôt be US sizing. Too small! Ordered 42DDD.
1.0,Shirt arrived with an oily spot in it- hoped that by having it spot treated and washing it would come clean but no luck -- otherwise the look and feel of the shirt is great just have to wear an oversized scarf to cover the spot
1.0,"Unfortunately, as with almost all plus size clothes, they are taylored for women with small arms and legs and big breasts and stomachs.  Those of us who are plus size all over with small breasts have a hard time finding clothes big enough in the arms and legs that aren't HUGE through waist and chest!"
1.0,"The size inaccurate they are too small, 2xl is the same size as a small. It would be nice if the size accurate."
1.0,Just received this.  The jacket is nice but the zipper does not work at all.  Returning.
1.0,"This is the worst charm ever.. The image is hardly visible, can not see that it says Momma Bear.. will never purchase again..."
1.0,I bought 4 pair of these glasses and every pair broke within 2 months. The last pair lasted about 20 minutes before breaking in half at the nose piece. The others broke right under the center of the left lens.
1.0,The silver beads were very tarnished when bracelet arrived and looked very cheap. Very disappointed to have to send back.
1.0,La franela est√° en la talla pero el short es muy peque√±o
1.0,The ridges irritate my ears so much that I can't wear them. :(
1.0,They are not at all like the description.  Def for taller bigger people
1.0,This ring does not look like the picture! It looks very cheaply made in person! Reminds me of the plastic rings you get in dress up kits!üëéüèª
1.0,Does not match Oakley Lizard 2. Original ones have large base that fit into the socket. This has like base like half of the original.
1.0,This item was very nice my husband loved it but it is most definitely not waterproof it is filled with water and a trusted and stopped working about a month after I gave it to him as a present
1.0,"Do not buy these. Plastic, not cloth/elastic. Will wear a sore on your feet."
1.0,They are nothing what I expected. They are very thin cheap quality pantyhose material with no firmness whatsoever
1.0,Right after unboxing I found a lot of stones are missing.
1.0,"My daughter would have loved this keychain to hang on her backpack. Unfortunately I've received and returned different keychains twice now, dirty rubber/ plastic ones that don't have the LEDs. Beware!"
1.0,If I could give it less stars I would! Came in a bag inside of a bag all balled up. When I opened the bag the tag fell on the floor. When I turned the dress around the zipper was already broken! This looks like someone's return! I am returning and will never buy again! Waste of time!
1.0,In accurate product description there are no ingravings of the word love on any of them.
1.0,"Looked great online, once delivered today, washed it on gentle before my son ever even wore it, and it completely frayed: belt, interior seams, complete mess! Not just ""fluff"" coming off as would be expected, but completely frayed. The interior seams do not appear to be ""finished"". The material also very coarse and rough on the skin. Very disappointed with this item. Was surprised, as it got so many good reviews, maybe I just received one from an ""off"" batch,but would definately avoid buying anything from this company again."
1.0,"Despite having OX3227 frames which are listed in the item name, these definitely don't fit."
1.0,At least Whitney got part of the necklace.  My package was completely empty!
1.0,"The feather on the back of the arrow is larger than I wanted/expected so it sticks out from the side of my ear almost 1/2&#34; inch which is unfortunate. This would have been something I could have lived with if the threads didn't get stripped in less than 2 months and I've only removed the barbell 3 times. The threads on my previous barbell lasted over 10 years and was removed from my ear HUNDREDS of times due to my job. It is also upsetting that most industrial barbells are made so that both ends can be unscrewed - not so with this one. It's ridiculous that the feather end is so HUGE but they couldn't drill it so that both ends could be removed. Lastly, the silver coating has already worn off on one end and, again, I've only had it 6 weeks and rarely remove it. Disgusted that I won't be able to get my money back or a replacement because it was purchased 6 weeks ago."
1.0,"They looked great when they aren't actually on,  once they are on you cannot see the actual picture..."
1.0,It‚Äôs was good! But it broke after 1week.
1.0,Shirt size seems to be about a medium. Material is very thin and see through. I honestly don't think it would hold up after a few washes.
1.0,never recive
1.0,I expected for the boot to have a little room but it's tight.. I'm giving them away to my daughter.. üò©
1.0,"I have purchased this on DressLily. It is exactly as pictured although lower quality than you would think. I spent significantly less on it. $20 is a rip off for the quality you get. The ‚Äúleather‚Äù choker piece is like wrapping hard, unforgiving plastic around your neck that refuses to lay flat. It also gets tangled really easily and is really difficult to figure out how to put on. Don‚Äôt buy this here."
1.0,Wore for 1 week and there footbed started peeling off!
1.0,Using rifles in an American flag is insensitive and callous after what happened in Uvalde. Amazon should be ashamed to sell this shirt.
1.0,it broke the first day i had it :( very cute tho
1.0,I couldn't properly adjust the  lanyard on my mask so it stayed  up on my head rather than slipping down over my ears and my hearing aid.<br />It didn't work for me at all.
1.0,It's to large in some parts and to small in others plus it's see thru and it just looks wrong don't buy but it did come sooner then expected that's why it got a one star rating.
1.0,"Purchased for my husband and would not fit, so the glove ripped since material was thin and poor quality.  Purchased for men but more like women fit"
1.0,This was broken upon arrival. Potter head daughter still wants to keep it but it's very cheaply made and the mechanism for opening it also changes the time and keeps it from running properly. Sad mom.
1.0,Run to big
1.0,"My first order, I found it strange that the collar tag was cut off. So I did a return. The replacement came today, and it's also missing the tag, and this time the jacket smelled like perfume or cologne. I'm not sure what's going on but it's unacceptable to sell something new and deliver items in such a condition."
1.0,beautiful jewelry. poorly made. barely holds up for one wearing.
1.0,"I rarely rate anything, but I want to warn others about my experience. First, the shipping I was charged was more than the shirt itself. I knew to order up, but I couldn't even attempt to put on a 3X. I am hoping that it will fit my sister who is a large. And lastly, it is neither tied died nor a sweat shirt. It is that weird cheap slippery material stamped to look tied died.  Horrible in every way."
1.0,Very disappointed with these. I went by there sizing chart but they were way too big & so cheap looking! I actually put them up to send back for a refund but forgot about them so that never happened...my bad but stuck with them. Uhhh....
1.0,The straps are to thick for the helmet. I had to rush and purchase a real quality zip chin pad from ‚ÄúDicks‚Äù which the straps was correct size
1.0,Dress arrived with a broken zipper. Very obviously broken which leads me to believe that this dress was not inspected. Returning for a refund.
1.0,"‚Äú Colors include pastels of pink, orange, green and colors as well! Leggings are picked at random from inventory and ‚Äù<br /><br />I received ugly brown!!!!!!!  Not expecting left over winter color.  Wanted the peach color in the<br />picture.<br /><br />The quality is good.  But beware of the color you get"
1.0,Miss leading size order for USA men!
1.0,This bag is a lot smaller than it appears in the photos. The material is thin and I don‚Äôt think it will last longer than a month. We‚Äôll see.
1.0,This product is nothing but cut styrofoam! It‚Äôs smaller than expected! Pass if considering for purchase! I only gave it one star because I couldn‚Äôt submit my review with selecting at least one star!
1.0,"The dress has two slits, the slit starts at the torso. In the picture the dress looks beautiful, however it‚Äôs not what I got."
1.0,"Cheap material, easily bendable and not worth the price."
1.0,Way too small. I ordered XL. I'll be returning it
1.0,the first night i wore it the buckle came loose and i lost the buckle but salvages the bracket
1.0,"Overpriced !!!  Would not have bought it if the material description was included. BTW any info was removed , so don‚Äôt know where it was made or what material it was made from."
1.0,"Doesn‚Äôt stay on cheeks, instant wedgie without even moving."
1.0,Its smaller than I thought and the picture is blurred. I also didn't know it was inside a bubble.
1.0,"Fits poorly. I'm 5'9 140 lbs got an XL because I need the length. Length is fine. Big in the waist and chest. However biggest problem, the lining of bigger than the suit and Hangs out on the butt and chest. See pics"
1.0,"It looks like a cheap imitation of the photographed product, which it is.  The hood is way too small to wear. The fabric is itchy as hell. All in all it just looks cheap."
1.0,"I love this ring, however it arrived with missing stones and it turns your finger green."
1.0,"The dress runs really small, My dress size is a 6-8 and I ordered a xlarge and it was too tight."
1.0,Snapped one on a pair of jeans and had to break it to get it off. The adjuster is the one with teeth and not easy to use. Very cheaply made item. Disappointed for sure.
1.0,"I have recently ordered shapermint items, I love the cami!  But this product, well, as a larger chested woman, this product does not provide the support needed.  I am not returning it, as it is comfortable and i wear it around the house or even to sleep in; but not something I would feel comfortable to wear outside the home.  Also, I went by the sizing chart, I think its a little large."
1.0,"Material is so cheap, Too big!!"
1.0,Ordered May 18 and received August 12!!! Horrible chemical smell and made of polyester. Went to return and said not able to return after August 7!!! Are you kidding me??? Took 3 months to get!! Do not buy!!! Horrible service and product. Also they were not Capri pants.
1.0,"BEWARE. These are fake. Please don't waste your money on cheap plastic junk with incorrect colors, rough edges and backing that says things like 'frist release'"
1.0,"These are nothing like the picture. I'd had my eye on them for a while and purchased when they went on sale (marked down to $18 from $45) but they're definitely not worth $18, let alone $45. They are solid dark blue and look really cheap; I think the &#34;stones&#34; are either plastic or acrylic and the metal irritates my ears as most cheap, impure metal does. Kind of a bummer, at least I didn't waste $45 on them though!"
1.0,I loved this dress when it came it. I was beyond hurt that it did not fit my 38DDDs. The dress is SEXY and will definitely turn heads. Silky material fitting right in all the right places except the BREAST. I bout got a medium and a large and M
1.0,Disappointed in the product. The size chart is not accurate. This is now another item ordered on Amazon that I wish I wouldn't have purchased.
1.0,"the pants would not stay up, and the knees wrinkled."
1.0,It looks like my kid has a turd on her head.
1.0,These are ridiculously see through. I only paid $8 for both pairs but had I known they were *that* bad I wouldn‚Äôt have even spent the $8. Truly terrible product.
1.0,"This beanie is too tight. It‚Äôs not one size fits all. The feel of the beanie is soft, but it‚Äôs not very warmed when you put it on."
1.0,It was way to small and made from a different fabric as the last one I bought
1.0,Hurt to take out eyebrow is infected now
1.0,The print is good but why would you print a MANS shirt on a WOMANS shirt! It's not going to fit and I don't have time to reorder and get it for Christmas
1.0,Just not what I need for my laptop.
1.0,I ordered this because it said it came in a pack of five boas. I only received ONE boa.

1.0,The material is really poor in terms of quality and it's not comfortable at all
1.0,"I purchased several sizes of panties for my 3 girls before they left with grandparents for the summer. The plastic package said size 14, so I packed the new package of panties for my eldest daughter. When she returned, we started putting all of her clean clothes away and all of her panties say 10-12, not the size 14 the box ordered. Aside from the wrong size being labeled, these already have holes in them and they're what, a month old? Disappointing."
1.0,Too small for even my two year old! I don‚Äôt get it!
1.0,Only received the visor. The description and picture indicate that I was purchasing an entire helmet. Do not buy your not getting a helmet!!
1.0,The earrings were very cute. But after 2 weeks of wearing them they started to turn  copper color. I guess You get what you pay for.

1.0,Se puso negro a la semana no es de buena calidad
1.0,I have a handmade leather belt and this clip is too thin to be functional. Works ok ion thinner nylon belts.
1.0,"44D Terrible fit! Barely covered breast and extension hooks did not work well, would not stay hooked."
1.0,"NOT EVEN REMOTELY SIMILAR TO THE FABRIC, texture color or fit as the pictures! This is more of a polyester tight knit fabric that wouldnt even fit the model like the photo.  All of these vendors seem to share pics and make these items out of whatever cheap fabric they can find!  Soooo disappointed!"
1.0,"The shoe just fits weird, got her a 10 which is her right size but it‚Äôs way too wide and looks awkward. Won‚Äôt be using it at all, I didn‚Äôt return it because I threw the packaging away."
1.0,The shirt has a metal fixture that broke instantly so now the shirt looks weird and I can‚Äôt wear it.
1.0,"It stained my legs, then I stained my furniture and bed sheets. No fun."
1.0,"immediately after I received it. Took it out of the packaging, put it on my ear, and SNAP - it was gone. Poor quality."
1.0,"most rings are very small, very cheap like out of a gumball machine, but I guess it was worth $1.82."
1.0,They were tarnish when they arrived. I had to returned them.
1.0,Fabric sleazy. So bad I didn‚Äôt even try it on!!
1.0,Their sizes are 2timed smaller than US sizes. Order accordingly
1.0,The green was olive.  Not kelly green at all.
1.0,Broke after only 3 days
1.0,the blouse is over sized at the top and narrow at the bottom.  It is shorter than pictured as well .  there is a lining bib on the inside that looks terrible when the blouse is worn.
1.0,The shirt had two holes in it!!! I had an elegant event and had to wear this bad shirts!!!!
1.0,These fit perfect...but then after two days of my child wearing them to school the strap broke. What a waste of money.
1.0,"It was made cheap, and size and color was way off. I usually a wear large, which is what I ordered This shirt was way too small. I ordered brown, and the brown color was so faded. Returned it next day"
1.0,The pictures show is nothing what this band looks like. It‚Äôs so transparent that you can barley tell there is any color on the band. Looks cheaply made.
1.0,This couldn‚Äôt be any shorter!  Best used as a shirt.
1.0,They were too big and didn't look good or slightly realistic
1.0,These earrings were beautiful but the way they were crafted was ridiculous.  They stuck out from the ear and looked awkward and heavy.  The thickness made them to heavy to fit against the ear and they were very just did not fit properly.<br />Did anyone try them on to check for this problem?
1.0,these glasses were not as advertised. They do not fit over regular glasses.  I was disappointed in the product.
1.0,These are great gloves but these gloves sold for under $20.00 when they were carried at Lowe's.
1.0,It seemed nicely made and it looked like the picture but I thought the arms were narrow and I returned it.
1.0,Product sizing not accurate
1.0,"Purchased on the 13th of Jan 22, by 7 Feb 22 the glued-on strip started coming off near the buckle, then on the band near the face of the watch.  Had to throw it away."
1.0,Cheap. Makes clicking sound when lifting. people can't see in unlike other's which are like sunglasses. Snapped after 1 month
1.0,"Shoes run very  big..cheaply made, and don‚Äôt fit your feet! I threw them away..They were not worth giving away"
1.0,The earrings are cute. They are not very good screw backs though. There is barely any threading on the post. My daughter was able to pull them out of her ears. I'm am extremely disappointed. I wish I would have tried them on her sooner because I would have returned them. Such a waste of money. We put the little purple flower screw backs in and she can't get those off. Don't waste your money on these if you're worried about your child getting them off.
1.0,"The fabric lays weird on this. It did fit because you had to tie it, so if you know your waist size, I‚Äôm sure it will fit."
1.0,I loved this dress but after a few washes it really goes downhill.
1.0,"I knew by the the measurements of the cord and pendant, it would be small.  I actually got it for my Granddaughter.  It is such an ugly color, I would not give it to her.  Very disappointed."
1.0,It‚Äôs okay I guess. The underwire is weird and seems to be a bit too high. The dress looks kinda cheap. I regret spending money on this
1.0,It's not cotton at all. It looks and feels like polyester and it looks cheep. I bought it for a Christmas present so didn't look too closely and missed the window for a return.
1.0,Too small. A joke. I had to send it back.
1.0,Two or three sizes small
1.0,"Sewn very well, about 2 - 3 sizes larger, and long sleeves on both size. Sewing quality is very good, the stuff is great."
1.0,"3X too small for 48B with one post-op shoulder, and other arm awaiting repair of cuff repairs was too sore for pulling up.  Probably would have needed 5X or 6X, if even made in that size.  Appears well made.  Will pass it along to someone who can use it."
1.0,The sweater is nice but it is not white.
1.0,Very misleading ad.  Shows multiple watch buckles but you will only receive 1 buckle.  Will not order anymore from this vendor.
1.0,"I was completely and thoroughly disappointed.  The item looks NOTHING like the picture. The picture must have been enlarged 500 times.  The item is not only tiny but the cord which looks like a thick rope in the picture actually looks like a tread. Save your money.  Do not buy this piece of junk, and do not believe the fake reviews of this product."
1.0,"I ordered a XXL and the package was marked XXL, although the gloves were closer to a size small.  Amazon made returning the gloves easy, although I was really hoping these would work as my isotoner gloves are in need of replacement.  Unfortunately these gloves will not be replacing them.  The quality was substandard too, not at all what I was expecting."
1.0,5 out of 6 looked okay... this one is all messed up and bent. Not what I wanted to give to my to be bridemaid. Thanks for giving me a crappy product

1.0,"With no rough handling, this broke within a week of use. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Fake and cheaply made, most had errors and problems. I missed the return window as we went out of town for vacation. These are fakes and junk."
1.0,"This hat is absurdly large.  When I tried it on, it slipped right down over my forehead.  Even my husband said it would never stay on his head.  He and I have other beanies that fit fine.  It's just odd."
1.0,The mesh back sucked seemed very cheap and the embroidery on front looked crooked (maybe it was me).
1.0,This product is not worth the 20. Worse quality than shein.
1.0,"I ordered this shirt to wear for my grandsons Jr ROTC competitions.  I was so disappointed when I put it on, the seam on you was not sewn and it had a cut on it. The sad part is I was away five hours away from home."
1.0,"Says it comes with a scrunchie,  has a picture with a scrunchie for the one i ordered and no scrunchie. That was the whole reason my granddaughter wanted it. She said she doesn't want it cuz it doesn't have a scrunchie so it will be going back. :-( the really shouldn't say it comes with something when it doesn't"
1.0,"Ordered XL, am 5FT 145LB and these were snug at hips, tight at thighs. I wont be able to even wear silk light weight long johns! Will be returning for refund."
1.0,"It was big on the top. I washed it before I can wear it, and the quality is poor."
1.0,Bottoms will fit‚Ä¶the top would literally fit me and I wear a size large..in women‚Äôs!
1.0,This product was defective when sent to me. Zipper was ripped and the were two holes in the material. It also has a terrible oder to it! Bad  vender!<br />One star rating only because it would not let me submit review without putting at least one!!
1.0,The size was not a 31 it was more like a 26 size
1.0,My wedge detached after only 3 weeks of use. Is it the vendor or manufacturer? Disappointed to say the least.
1.0,"Got the band for my boyfriend because he wanted something more breathable for work, he works in the heat. He put the new bands on less than 3 weeks ago and they are already wearing through where they connect to the watch."
1.0,"The color in the photo looks like salmon, but what you get is a bright pink. The top portion of the dress doesn't drape off the shoulder, like the picture either. The fabric has this awful polyester feel. I returned it promptly."
1.0,"I am so ready to send  this back but its not worth it. It looks likes something that came out of a gumboil machine. It looks so cheap. All of it. The ring, bracelet, earrings and necklace. The earrings the post is so thick I'm not sure how I'm going to get them in my ears.  It doesn't even look pretty. I have had other cheap jewelry look much prettier than this. I don't like it. Save your money."
1.0,I have owned 2 pairs of these glasses and they both broke a month after receiving them.  Junk.
1.0,I am so disappointed. I have not only return this once but two √ó3 larger size and it still doesn‚Äôt fit. I bought this for my godmother who loves these nightgowns. She is 53 and 195 pounds. I originally bought a IIx and it felt like a medium. I returned it for a 3X which fit exactly the same . So now I have to return it again and I will not buy another one.
1.0,Bad quality and came with a rip in the dress
1.0,Broke the second time I worn it
1.0,Not what I expected. Bought for husband but for 8 yr old son instead. Got medium men‚Äôs.
1.0,"No sirve, perd√≠ mi dinero, no es el color que se muestra y el size es un caos. No pierdan su dinero, la regale de una vez"
1.0,44mm. Too large.
1.0,"Amazon, really? You actually approved of the item from this vendor? Shame on you. Yes, it was inexpensive but sometimes you're pleasantly surprised. Not this time. I wouldn't even wear it to work in my fenced back yard.  Sending it back is a waste of my time."
1.0,"The hat was exactly what he wanted but it was shipped in a bag, instead of a box and the front of the hat was smashed. It still looks a little funny a month later, even when he wears it. It might be better to order from another site."
1.0,I returned the item as the rivets were not correctly finished and the band could not be worn
1.0,"The gloves are not of the quality that I expected based on the description on Amazon. I was expecting a much heavier and more durable fabric, an actual glove. Also, the edges don't have a quality finish and will fray and lose their shape. I could have cut off a pair of tights, put them on my arms and achieved the same result. I am highly disappointed in this product. It isn't close to being worth $27. I am returning them asap."
1.0,If you are a 3x -4x don't buy this
1.0,Don't do it. They do not block anything. Uv sun rays anti glare not true. Basically some clear glass lenses that are not going to do anything but be clear. Hahaha
1.0,Different parts of the necklace had different color stones. They were not consistent at all
1.0,This shoe runs way too small I could not wear them once . Get at least one size larger
1.0,Great but already a hole in scrotch area. Bought a month ago.
1.0,"Zippers are not good.  Broke almost immediately<br />Shorts are soft but zippered pocket was the reason I bought them, so I wouldn't recommend these if you want functioning zippers"
1.0,Size is good. BUT this is not real Ralph lauren but imitation. Very regrettable...
1.0,It did not hold my keys and id badge. They both broke.
1.0,Very cheap. Junk
1.0,"The Bands did not stay in place even a week. Very poorly made and as you tie both ends in your wrist, you will see them pulling itself from face of the body of the watch. What I am trying to say is that the pull of the two sides when clipped in the wrist does not keep the band in place where its attached to the body of the watch. It eventually came off and I bought 2 pairs and both did the same. I know they are aftermarket ..but would not recommend it for anyone as it was a total waste of my 25 Dollars. Apologies if this review does not satisfy you but we have to call a spade a spade!! no sugar coating."
1.0,Absolutely awful Fit. And the print felt cheap as well. Bad purchase
1.0,"Horribly large. I am plus size (14-16) , but I am not an elephant!!!! I measured before buying, so i was shocked when they came and were still not an accurate fit! The inseam is stupid. Too long of an inseam. A seriously idiotic inseam. The shorts came up to my bra, and I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù, not a short person."
1.0,"very poor quality, will not buy again"
1.0,"Very poor construction , long time to be delivered & Sizes do not match"
1.0,China has different sizes and Amazon  should know that<br />The L that I received is more like a SMALL in America and I gave it to a friend who wears a size Petite<br />it fit her perfectly
1.0,The item was super thin and didn't flow like the picture
1.0,"I purchased the shirt for part of a costume however as soon as I open the package I was overwhelmed with the smell of mildew. Since the shirt came the day I needed the costume I didn‚Äôt have time to wash it so I frebrezed the heck out of it. That did absolutely nothing to hide the absolute horrible smell of the shirt. The shirt also came damaged there were a lot of pricks and snags along with A questionable gray stain.<br /><br />Afterwards I washed the shirt and it basically fell apart, I found this to be a low quality product and kinda gross."
1.0,Not designed if you have an amble bossom.
1.0,"Too thin,  Too small , not of good Quality!!! I'd give zero stars if I could"
1.0,The earrings were totally tarnished and tangled.  It was a disappointment.
1.0,it was only one bra not a three pack missing  2 bras
1.0,"Two pockets were so small that I could not even get my hands into them. I ordered my standard size and was barely able to secure the button. Small size restricted movement such that I had difficulty climbing a stairs. Certainly not pants that would be comfortable for hiking or for most daily activities. Also, one of the pockets had a mask in it and it looked like it had been worn. I took them off after five minutes and returned them. I was surprised at the poor fit because I have another pair from this manufacturer that I like a lot and would give it a five except for pockets are poorly designed so that every time I sit down on a couch or soft cushioned chair, any coins, screws or other small items fall out the top of the pockets."
1.0,The belt itself is great the buckle has been rusting.  Don‚Äôt buy.
1.0,Size to big ..
1.0,"I received 3 pair each of the same color.  Beige / Ivory / Brown/Pink paisley.  They are not pretty at all.  I read the reviews that might happen, so not surprised.  However, these undies are not hipsters.  They are regular panties.  They look nothing like what is on the package picture.  I'll keep them for work panties, because I hate the hassle of returning stuff.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Too small for the size I ordered.  Even ordered 1 size up.
1.0,Oversized and poofy. My family made fun of me and called me the Michelin Woman.
1.0,This shoe is not true to size and it is now comfortable to walk
1.0,"I ordered the largest size possible, it comes all misshapen, very very thin and stiff, It will get donated to charity. Don't waste your money, not to mention it took forever to get here"
1.0,"BREAKS easily, DON't get their products. I adjusted it 3x and it broke."
1.0,"If you do decide to buy, order at least 2 sizes smaller than your true size.<br />Because you will be walking out of them by the second time you wear them. I made the mistake and ordered only one size smaller.<br />They look fine but the material of construction actually shrinks quickly and because on the the lack of top design<br />support you will be ""flapping around"" until you finally decide to take them off. That took me only three short attempts."
1.0,There was a rip in the dress and they don‚Äôt give enough time to return.
1.0,Wayyy too large
1.0,Very pretty and very comfortable. Sizing is accurate but top is a bit short.  Unfortunately after one wear the thread on the seam of pants and top separated leaving holes in the leg and top.  I‚Äôm very disappointed.  Contacted seller and awaiting a response.
1.0,Had the watch for 1 week and then the band completely broke! So disappointed
1.0,Terrible. So thin and completely unusable
1.0,This dress was very thin and flimsy.  It looks beautiful in the picture but is cheaply made and has snags.
1.0,I lost my watch several times because one bump by someone and the thing fell off.  It was cool to have two colts to choose from but magnets just not strong enough.  Highly disappointed :( it was very easy to remove lol and was comfortable for the moments it stayed in place.
1.0,Not even close to XL
1.0,Arrived broken. Cheap looking and very poor quality.
1.0,This belt is the worst the top layer of material started peeling after one use and the pin on the buckle falls off making it difficult to put on
1.0,"Did not like the quality, the size was not true. It is being returned"
1.0,I was looking forward to these Jack Rogers.  This is my favorite style.  They were too wide.  I have other Jack Rogers that are size 6 that fit perfectly but these were too wide.
1.0,This sweatshirt is horrible I use to only buy russel athletics sweatshirts and when I saw it on amazon I jumped at buying it but they are cheap now short and just not like I remember them at all! Would not recommend this product to any one!
1.0,Only 33 of the 48 lights actually work :(
1.0,These pants are listed to be sized from Small to 5XL.  I am plus size and wear 3XL.  I thought just in case they run a bit small because they are supposed to be slim fitting I ordered a size up.  When I took them out of the package I saw that there was NO WAY these were a 4XL.  They look like XL.  TOTAL WRONG SIZING.  Very very disappointed.  I gave them away to a friend that could wear them.  But now the pants I wanted to wear for my 50s themed 50th birthday are not. :(
1.0,"I kind of had this set before, but from some other manufacturer - and bought it because that was really good. This one is nothing like that - thinks made of molded plastic are rough, forkspoon is not practical neither as spoon nor fork, pans are made of the thinner cheaper metal, and the utensils itself are a bit scratched - probably thrown around during the transportation, but who cares."
1.0,"Great price, wrong size...  Says medium on the tag but is actually an &#34;Extra Large&#34;."
1.0,This is not solid copper as advertised it states many times and it is solid copper but it is not this is only electroplated copper on a base metal base this is not real copper this bracelet is only worth about $10 it's a piece of junk and not worth your time money or energy I'm extremely disappointed and unhappy I was expecting much more from the advertisement but the advertisements say.  THIS IS ONLY ELECTROPLATING OVER BASE METAL! !!!
1.0,"doesn't really work that well, too hard to use."
1.0,Zipper broke the first time i tried to close the bag with only one suit!! do  not recommend
1.0,I LOVED this little bag. It is roomy and bright pink. But now 35 days after delivery the strap broke at the bag insertion.
1.0,"Huge hat, could fit 2 heads. Doesn‚Äôt wash well, so you can‚Äôt get your t wet in the pool. I would not recommend this at all."
1.0,The black sleeves color bleeds on the pink at the first wash.
1.0,This collapsible hat broke after 3 attempts
1.0,Not TTS like it said. Not the softest material
1.0,Had for less then a month before it broke.
1.0,Terrible:( I guess you get what you pay for. After 5 minutes of use my nose began itching and I had to remove them immediately. Very cheap materials.
1.0,"Shirt runs very small<br />Material is thin<br />Design appears to be an iron on<br />If this doesn‚Äôt live through the washing machine, I‚Äôm returning it"
1.0,The side of the sole was detaching on the second use. Bad quality. Don‚Äôt buy
1.0,"I was majorly excited when my fiance bought me these sunglasses! They were very cute, and had the Realtree brand printed on them. I figured they would be of good quality. Turns out, the first time I wore these, I barely touched them and the whole side snapped in half! Won't be buying these again, but I have yet to find anything comparable unfortunately!"
1.0,Fit terribly. So loose around chin. Will probably throw out.
1.0,"Perfect dress for my engagement photos. Came in great time but came with a tear in the dress. The dress fit well but I figured I could go down in size. When I bought it, it could be delivered within a few days. But now that I need a REPLACEMENT and a different size... it‚Äôs between 3-4 weeks before I can get it. Makes no sense, I ordered way before I actually need it (Nov. 14)"
1.0,Broke immediately upon wearing.
1.0,Wish I could give no star rating! Too small... I haves request for refund and no one has contacted with regards to rerun slip. Very very bad product!!! Beware of stuff from this company !!! Very poor and not at all true to size ...
1.0,"Fit somewhat small, can't really wear them but nice if they were the right size"
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt stick at all
1.0,Item does not look like the jacket pictured. It‚Äôs a different color and is sewed so I look like I‚Äôm wearing a large bag. The collar is completely different too. Take note of the triangle collars in the adversemebt versus the puffy circular ones in my picture
1.0,"Useless, too small"
1.0,"A bit tight on the bust.  The bottom is made of a stiff cotton mix material and does not lay flat.  Because it lays stiff, it makes you look much sider than you are."
1.0,The G and T on Government sewn into and not readable.
1.0,Does anyone looked at it before shipping it?
1.0,"Broke the first time wearing it. The chain broke, then the locket separated. Would not recommend."
1.0,really cheap and tacky.  An adult would look silly using this.
1.0,Glass was sent broken and not worth sending back
1.0,Must be extra small not mdium
1.0,Not what I expected. It was very trucker driver-ish
1.0,Just don‚Äôt. It ripped when I tried it on.<br />It runs hella small. I tired it on and all you saw was my ass literally. It doesn‚Äôt flare out like on this model.
1.0,To big and they would not exchange them
1.0,"Not happy at all, received the order. Opened the case and the cardboard lining fell out!"
1.0,We only swim occasionally and they didnt even last part of the summer before they fell apar
1.0,"Really disappointed in this bolero.  The color represented in the photo is BRIGHT green. In reality, the color is a dull grass color.  The item I received had no tags and had orange fuzzies on it.  It looks used and stretched out."
1.0,"Even with he size guide, still too small."
1.0,It shrunk on the first wash. Whomp whomp.
1.0,This thing is see through and very baggy. Don't buy it.
1.0,I put the socks on for the second time and they ripped.  They worked great but they should last more than 1 wearing!
1.0,"Whatever size you need, order 3 sizes above that!"
1.0,"I'm 5'4 and 120 pounds with a heavy chest. I bought the apricot color in medium. I didn't care for how the dress fell on my curves. I also didn't like how sheer the fabric was, even with a slip. Can't recommend. Returned it."
1.0,"I'm not a big guy and most my baselayers and T-shirts are S and trim fit. But I'm buying this rash guard for weekend tubing trip and swimming, so I figure to build in some slack and order an M. But it is way too small and I can barely fit into it. It is skin tight and uncomfortable. The material seems nice enough, maybe I'll try a large size. But no matter what I have no time before this weekend's trip. I'll have to go without a rash guard and a lot of sunscreen. What a disappointment"
1.0,This has a great look. I didn‚Äôt expect a nice lining. Unfortunately. The zipper broke the first time I put it on.
1.0,Photo did not show metallic fiber which makes it unusable for me.  To feminine
1.0,It is intended for very small buttons and mine was larger.  I doubt it lasts even on little buttons.
1.0,"I like the co!our and the pockets.  It is NOT so much a-line and it is NOT midi length.  It would have to be 4-6 inches longer to be midi,,,, this falls just below the knee and I am 5'  6"" .  Very dissatisfied."
1.0,Theses were too big and bet really easily.
1.0,I bought this and it has a rubber band that you have to cut to get it to fit and if you cut it too short like I did you have a worthless watch!!!!!!!  there is no where to find a replacement band.  The clasp has no adjustments on it...great looking watch...I can make you a great deal if you have a small wrist.  Looks like I now have a pocket watch....majorly bummed
1.0,"These Accuratic Watch Winders look nice and when they work they are great. I have two multiwinder set-ups, a three by two set-up for six winder and a double winder set-up. The available brackets make it easy to configure the number of winders you have to your needs. But as other reviews have stated there are many issues. I have personally replaced 5 motors through time, had the stripped drum - which renders the winder useless, and jammed drums so nothing moves. I did not get these on Amazon but saw them here and wanted to give potential purchasers a heads up."
1.0,"Smaller than expected. Only could fit cash, small tube of gloss and maybe a thing of plural."
1.0,"This bag is not what it is, it's looks nice on the outside but the bag is made of hard plastic also inside of the bag there is cardboards to hold the bag in place didn't like it so I return it"
1.0,Item arrived not working. I was a little disappointed considering it took over a month to arrive.
1.0,Yeah this is my 5 time trying to get ahold of the company and I still ain't ever heard from them the necklace was gift boxes all cute and stuff but it's not what I wanted for my daughter it's not shiny or anything it scratched and plus the heart is way too big for the tiny thin necklace so of course it broke the same day my daughter wore it and it was a birthday gift all I want is my money back
1.0,The Rossettes fell off in less than 6 hours of normal use.  These are cheaply made and so disappointing.
1.0,Runs VERY small.  Beware and order a larger size than what you need.
1.0,Falls apart soon as you touch it
1.0,I've washed the gloves twice and they still have a strong chemical smell.
1.0,The scarf arrived wrinkled and there is a smell also there is no tags it looks used.<br />Returning
1.0,"I order my size according to the chart supplied by this company and what I found is the chart is so far off it was ridiculous. The chart sizing must be geared towards children because I could barely get them past my thighs, I normally wear a size medium and when I took them out of the package they looked to fit a 12 year old."
1.0,Very disappointing! I thought it was made for adults but seems like it would fit a child instead! Was way too small! I love grumpy cat and now I'm out $18 . Too overpriced!
1.0,"I have been looking for pink masks forever, so I was happy to find this product. After I used it the first time my face started to feel red and itchy. As much as I love the pink color I have to stop using it due to an allergy issues."
1.0,Don't like the way they fit on sit on the nipple. It's also difficult to get the hearts to face the same way. Not what I expected.
1.0,I was stunned when I opened the package and pulled something totally different then the picture. Looks cheaply made and nothing like the picture. Don't waste your time.
1.0,3 of the so call diamonds fell out
1.0,Cute belt but when it came it smelled like a swamp. I had to return the belt the smell was horrible.
1.0,keeps military time
1.0,"I am Updating my review from 2 stars to 1. After two washes, one pair got a huge run in them. They ARE NOT seamless at all and I‚Äôm actually embarrassed to wear in public lol<br /><br />I got these to lounge in.<br /><br />The fabric feels okay. Not SUPER soft or comfy , but standard seamless material. They are Stretchy and PRETTY true to size, but honestly, I‚Äôd size up if you‚Äôre on the fence. I got small - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 128lbs, and they‚Äôre snug. The range of colors is nice.<br /><br />The fit IS NOT okay. They fit somewhere between boy short and bikini, cutting into my buttcheek, and giving me a double butt. They also roll up, which is what caused me to dock stars. They‚Äôre not sexy, but i at least wanted them to be comfy. Sadly, nope.<br /><br />They held up well in the wash, and I didn‚Äôt notice any shrinkage. Seem to be made well. I didn‚Äôt wear them out with clothing so I can‚Äôt comment on how ‚Äúseamless‚Äù they really are. I‚Äôm sure these may fit some bodies wonderfully, but they don‚Äôt work for me."
1.0,Cheaply made and way too big. Returned them
1.0,"Horrible quality, paint came off within a couple of hours"
1.0,"Sunglasses arrived missing one of the screws that held the right arm on. The screw was not in the case. Complete waste of time. Better quality control on gas station glasses. Clearly would not recommend these unless you love the look, in which case order two and you may be able to make one working pair."
1.0,Disappointed with the size. Cloudy color.
1.0,the  shirt pills terribly--poor quality--
1.0,This thing broke as soon as i got it. It hurt my ear turned it red and would not stay on. It was not well crafted. It is the worst thing I have ever bought off of amazon. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS A SCAM!!!!!!!!!! T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Waist of money after about 2 weeks the handle to the reel fell off and got lost
1.0,Not as pictured. Item is cheaply made and much smaller than advertised.
1.0,The pic shows it being orange when actually it's a peachy yellow color. I don't like it.
1.0,"I bought these bras to wear under a couple of maxi dresses that had necklines that were too revealing.  They offer no support at all, which I expected, being a very busty woman.  While I expected to have to wear my regular bra underneath these, I didn't expect the fabric to be so sheer that my bra would be fully visible.  Terrible, extremely thin fabric. I'm very disappointed, because now I not only have to return the bras, but two maxi dresses as well."
1.0,"Cheap, flimsy, junk. Would've bought at Walmart for less if known it was this flimsy of jewelry."
1.0,Pretty much a waste of my money and time
1.0,Came with a hole in it already
1.0,Runs small and cheap material.
1.0,"The mask was appropriate for a size SMALL.  The shirt was probably a size LARGE, NOT AN X-LARGE.  Would not order online because the sizing was so poor."
1.0,"Garbage, if I could rate it a zero I would. Terrible customer service save your money"
1.0,Ordered a size up..XXL ...and it would most likely fit a small/ medium .... very disappointing. Giving a 1 star because it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to leave a lesser rating!
1.0,"The peacock and everything is fine! But, the feather is very badly attached or not properly packed. The feather makes the chain look very ugly! I don't recommend to buy this crap!"
1.0,Absolutely horrendous. Only half actually lock (which I thought at first was a good idea) the ones that don‚Äôt fall out and I stepped on a nail. The ones that do lock cannot be taken apart and need pliers to rip them out of your pants. Do not buy. Not worth it. Not to mention they are painful on tour waist band because the pin backs are so long
1.0,This mask may not fog but does sweat.  Awful !!
1.0,"This bootie was cheaply made, the inside seam of the zipper was falling apart as soon as I got it. No support or structure to the bootie. Unfortunately I returned them"
1.0,I was given a 70 meter rope when I'm sure I purchased an 80 meter.
1.0,Lesson learned - don't go for the cheapest even when it's only going to be used for dress-up. This had a hole in it when opened and the wires were popping through as soon as we ent to try it on.
1.0,The watch didn't even work!!!!
1.0,"Way too big!! And the clasp keeps coming undone. I would have lost it if I wasn't wearing it inside the house. Otherwise, the colors are pretty."
1.0,"Honestly, the fit isn‚Äôt bad but it‚Äôs so cheap I don‚Äôt even want it. Also back flap is not actually a pocket. Lots of corners cut on this product."
1.0,"These shirts are so small, in a large and medium, that they will fit my tiny 12 year granddaughter"
1.0,Seams don‚Äôt line up
1.0,First day wearing them and they broke‚Ä¶.I may have had them on 2 hours. They looked really cute but made very cheaply.
1.0,"I went tubing on a river last weekend. Three people brought these tubes, and only one survived the trip. In my opinion, they should not be able to sell this model, as it has a severe design flaw causing the strap to rip a hole in the side of the tube. Could be dangerous, but it's definitely inconvenient. The round tubes by Intex, however, are just fine and all of them survived the trip."
1.0,Not the best material. ... more polyester to me than cotton. ..
1.0,Normally I love Grace Karin products this on was great quality only it was to big
1.0,"Although the description says ""item included: three pack"" there is only one headband. Colors are much brighter than pictured... flowers were falling off and will need hot glued"
1.0,These shirts suck. They shrink really bad. Horrible I'd rate with a no stars if I could.
1.0,"So disappointing!!<br /><br />I just bought three of these in various styles (at $9.99 plus tax and a fairly hefty shipping fee for something that could fit in a first class envelope).<br /><br />Description says for kids 4-12.  Well, they are all going to the four year old boy because there is no way they fit the 9 year old girl.<br /><br />Quality is ok. Not great compared with the similarly priced but much better quality adult masks I own. There is one layer of fabric (so no liner) and the ear loops are non adjustable.<br /><br />Who on earth sells a Harley Quinn mask that only a four year old could wear?"
1.0,"Very UNflattering.<br />Did not like the fit.<br />Wish it clearly said return by certain date, bc Amazon used to allow returns anytime. Very disappointing."
1.0,"When I bought this, not only did it not arrive at all and I had to contact Amazon for a replacement. The necklace we received as replacement broke immediately when I put it on. I loved the pin and earrings, but the most important part of the purchase was the necklace. Had to return and will not buy this item again, looking for an alternative with better quality."
1.0,"Kind of fit like an old potato sack, not feeling it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 140 pounds with a pear body shape. It didn‚Äôt do much for my figure and the medium (my normal size) was extremely baggy. It looks like I‚Äôm going to a college toga party, not my friend‚Äôs baby shower I was planning on wearing it to in a few months. Material feels like paper mache. It‚Äôs going back."
1.0,"I ordered these glasses for night and fog driving but can't say they help.  Also, and the reason I gave it one star is they are not polarized, maybe that would make a difference."
1.0,This item is not hemmed. The cuffs and the bottom edges of the fabric are frayed. It will probably become unravelled in a day or two. This product is in no way worth 30 dollars.
1.0,"This is my first Stone Mountain purse, I always thought they were too expensive. I loved it! Until the zipper got stuck. I believe I‚Äôve had it a year, maybe year and half. I change my purses a lot, mostly seasonal, so I can keep them for years. The zipper is sown so close that it‚Äôs just coming apart. No way to repair, would be way too costly. Very‚Ä¶.very‚Ä¶..disappointed‚Ä¶."
1.0,HORRIBLE!!!!! These are not at all worth the money. Do not waste your time. The sizing chart is total BS. I‚Äôm a size 0 and ordered a size Small. I should of bought a large with the way these fit. The stitching was already falling apart as well. Super disappointed. Also the pop fit customer service is super rude. Don‚Äôt waste your time
1.0,"Had issues with the power button from the start.  A regular push wasn't enough, had to press it hard for it to work.  Called in not long after we purchased it because it wasn't working any longer, and was told to hold the power button for 30 seconds to reset the watch.  It worked initially but after several months (son barely used it, never dropped or damaged it in any way) the button no longer works therefore we're not able to turn it on... It charges, but since the power button isn't working it's useless.  Come to find out the warranty was only for 30 days which is way to low for something electronic.  Please help, my 6 yr old son really liked the watch when it was working.  At this point it feels like my money went down the drain on this purchase.  Please help."
1.0,The elastic in these bracelets are exceptionally stretchy or big. I put the bracelets on and had a hard rime keeping them on my wrist as they would fall off when I moved my hand. I returned them two weeks ago and still waiting for a refund.
1.0,"NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!!  I bought this product for my son. He only ware them at home not for a long time. But within a month, they are already broken. Very bad quality. Very disappointed.  I hope I could return them !"
1.0,I wear an XL/2xl top and ordered a 3xl knowing It ran small.  It was soooooooo small my back couldn‚Äôt move.
1.0,In the process of returning this watch... It looks great but the overall fit and finish just isn't worth the $130 price tag. Clasp does not close properly on bracelet. For a moment I considered buying another bracelet but I'm not going to.
1.0,"My coat is too small and am having much difficulty getting a return label, or my refund! The coat is nice, just too small and it doesn't come in a larger size, I just want my refund."
1.0,"There were only 2 pairs, not the 3 advertised"
1.0,At 32 degrees farenheit you feel the cold.
1.0,Very large and didn't fit a child or an adult
1.0,"I was so excited to get this shirt only to see how skinny it was. The length was extra long, but it is very thin in the stomach area. I normally wear a large, but read it runs small so I got an XXL and it still looked tiny. I went to try it on anyway, only to realize that the shirt wouldn't open! When they put the letters on somehow the glue had seeped through into the backside and glued the shirt closed in many spots. I contacted the seller and am getting a refund, but I would have rather gotten a new shirt. Very disappointed."
1.0,You gotta be kidding me! These socks look nothing like the ones they show on their picture!
1.0,Beautiful looking bag but the center stone fell out 3 hours into the wedding I just attended. I handled it with care because it‚Äôs clearly a delicate piece but it still didn‚Äôt hold up. Terribly disappointed.
1.0,"When they say random they mean RANDOM. You will not be receiving any of the ones you see in the pics. You will be getting peppa pig, baby disney princesses and so on. If you have small small children this would be great. Out of 30 I couldn‚Äôt find one I would wear. So just be forewarned you won‚Äôt be receiving any of the ones out of the picture."
1.0,Returned bad fit very slim and skinny and long and my granddaughter is small so can‚Äôt imagine who this would actually fit
1.0,The shirt is nothing as far as color goes as the one in the picture. I ordered a large and got a medium. I haven't washed or worn it yet. Not satisfied with this shirt at all. Looks like something the kids would do at home
1.0,photos cuter than product.
1.0,Turns your skin green.
1.0,The keychain came apart. I need a refund
1.0,"I have bought probably several dozen of these rings in many styles, colors, and sizes. I have never received one that looked this bad. Half of the stones looked rotted inside. They were half dark brown, partly green, and partly orange. For the first time, I am returning.  Might be a fluke...take your chances..."
1.0,Legs are way too long. Material feel horrible on your skin and very cheaply made.
1.0,"The dress got torn the min I put it in I had to spend 50 to fix it and get it back to what it was like,really nice dress but material no good."
1.0,"The straps do not end with piece of leather that will protect the metal rings from scratching your camera. So if you would mind deep scratches on the body of your camera or case from the metal rings, do not buy."
1.0,First off the first time I washed this robe it shrunk 2 sizes and I probably could have made another robe from the lint it left behind.  The hood has a large tear down the seam and very cheaply made.  Very thin and not absorbent. Not impressed.
1.0,This looks like a dress. Definitely not what was expected. Fabric is extremely stretchy. Pattern is so cute. I wish they had gotten this right.
1.0,It came broken. The class was shattered on the edges.
1.0,"Posts were too big, returned."
1.0,"the sizing chart on their page is WAY off! I normally wear an XL - 1X in women‚Äôs plus sizes. I ordered an 8X AND IT‚ÄôS TOO SMALL! Doesn‚Äôt button over my bust which is a 44. Ridiculous. Waste of money- don‚Äôt bother. Material is nice, but, not made to fit Americans."
1.0,"Pearl fell out of cage, very upsetting."
1.0,Tore completely around the collar after the first wash. Cute but a waste of money.
1.0,Didn't use them threw them away too cheap looking
1.0,"I am 6'1"" and 200lbs with an athletic build. I ordered a medium based on other reviewers saying the product runs large. The medium was far too big on me. The cut is also very wide and boxy. BEWARE that there is NO free return shipping. In the end, you'll pay as much to ship it back as you did on the actual product. So be prepared to just burn money if you are not satisfied."
1.0,I made the mistake of thinking this was a seersucker short...mostly because it said it is.  It is not.  It is a synthetic fabric that will wake everyone in a 2 mile radius any time you move.  It is basically like wearing a doritos bag as shorts.
1.0,I ordered an XL Navy and received 3 black dresses. The package said xl on all 3(I only ordered 1 dress) but only 1 fit and it was still tight ( I'm 5ft 2in and 190lbs.i normally wear an XL) it barely reached my ankles
1.0,The colors faded to almost nothing after one wash.
1.0,Terrible fabric! This is not a winter shirt. No way it‚Äôs going to keep you warm.. I donated it to a charity shop.
1.0,I ordered the green skirt .... it was not the same skirt shown on the picture ... it was pleated and loose fitted.
1.0,"The wire is so thin and, not surprisingly, broke off after a few months. Would NOT recommend this product."
1.0,I expect something greater
1.0,Do not buy if you have any kind of hips or curves but going by the size chart. I can‚Äôt even return them bc it‚Äôs a hassle AND I HAVE TO PAY SHIPPING TOO??? So disappointed!
1.0,Sema was right down the front middle of the dress
1.0,"Return window expired at 30 days and at 45 days, the show separated from the sole.  I could have bought TWO PAIR of Sketchers flip flops for the same price and they would have lasted longer.  GARBAGE."
1.0,The feathers on this product fall out and make just a big mess.
1.0,"Fit is very disproportional, not able to wear"
1.0,When I got this shirt I noticed that there was not tags to be found. I ordered an XL and this shirt fits like a small.
1.0,Keeps popping off
1.0,completely different from size chart. ordered an xl and the size looks more like a women's small
1.0,The strap broke after wearing for less than an hour. If I could return it I would. It‚Äôs non returnable.
1.0,They don't stay up very well.  Disappointed for Steve Madden
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Mine broke just after a month. Just came apart.  Can‚Äôt return.
1.0,"I purchased this for my sister who is having a hard time wearing watches on her wrist. She picked out this necklace and was excited to get it, but the watch didn't work at all.. some of the dial was broken off as well. Disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,Quick Google search says this is not worth it price wise
1.0,"I ordered a two pairs of these types of pants from the same supplier, but different color, and different item number. I received two pairs today, but they are both the same. I'm unable to print a label or return them, so I'm stuck with two pairs of the same pants, and in top of that, they're too small! See photo."
1.0,"I wanted to love this necklace, and I really did when it came in the mail. It is very dainty with a thin chain and even the letter/pendant is thin, but I was okay with that. However, it broke the first time I wore it!! So, 1 star review from me. Had to return"
1.0,"I realized that the scarf is made from polyester as soon as I touched it. I own true silk items and have familiarity how silk feels. When I checked the label it said &#34;100% silk touch&#34; which is funny way of saying &#34;100% polyester that we hope you will take for the silk&#34;. Maybe it is interesting way of labeling but description on the Amazon website saying it is silk scarf. Now, that is false advertising!"
1.0,"Not a fan, they don‚Äôt stay on your foot, and keep falling off your heal."
1.0,"This chemise is pretty but completely doesn‚Äôt last even with a nylon mesh bag which I use for all underwear or delicate garments. Unless you‚Äôre willing to hand wash, don‚Äôt expect it to last; all the fibers started to unravel. I‚Äôve only had for less than 3 months. So sad."
1.0,"Maybe it's the way I walk, but the tops of the sandals kept hitting the ground. My feet kept riding forward and the shoe rode backwards, creating an awkward walk, to say the least. A couple hours into wearing them, the top of the shoe scaped the pavement, leaving a pretty large and noticable gash. I promptly returned home and threw the sandals away. I wish the shoes would have worked out, though."
1.0,This is pseudoscience nonsense
1.0,"The purse arrived stuffed in a flat padded envelope. I took it out of the package and had to struggle a little to open it up. I'm disappointed in the quality, there's a defect in the black outlining where it doesn't connect. I'd return it but then I'd have to pay an extra $10-$20 to get it back to them. Not worth it. If you're looking for a cheaply made bag, this is it. The color is cool but that's about it."
1.0,Is not what I expected does not have a chrome tip and feel upset
1.0,"Not so great quality, also smells bad"
1.0,These glasses fit way too small and feel cheap. They look and feel like children's glasses I will be returning these
1.0,"Product description states that this vest has a TWO-WAY zip front.<br />It doesn't, so I will be returning this vest.<br />But if you don't mind a standard zipper, then you will love this vest!<br />Thank you."
1.0,"The hoodie we received is sewn wrong. The hood has the pink on the outside and the white on the inside, which is the opposite of what is pictured and what we expected to get when we ordered."
1.0,The do not fit. My head is too big for the size of the strap.
1.0,"Loved the fit and look at first. Super comfortable and cute. Been wearing most days for the last 4 months, but now one of the rings has the gold wearing off and discolored. Looks cheap and gross"
1.0,"After the first band's buckle came apart on my wrist, I sent it back in time for a refund. I liked it si much I ordered another one. Same broked buckle, this time in 5 weeks, too late for a refund. Great looking band with a problem buckle. Stay away!"
1.0,tried to put money in and it was like forcing a square peg in a round hole.
1.0,"This top was totally out of proportion.  It was nice  material  but it was cut too wide and too short in the body. And the arms were skin tight, and I do not have heavy arms. Would not recommend."
1.0,Nothing like the picture different pattern looks like a night gown insted of a dress
1.0,"Almost two inches shorter than it was supposed to be, also clunky and poorly made."
1.0,Doesn't fit like the picture. It doesn't hang. And it make sure you look frumpy.
1.0,"Don‚Äôt even bother purchasing this mask. It will not fit your face. The placement of the Velcro, is way off. Not worth the money!"
1.0,Dont pay for this
1.0,"Not fleece lined leggings,  but thin see through tights.  Very upset that I did not recieve what I paid for."
1.0,Cheaply made. Band Fabric is just cut. No hems or stitching
1.0,Es horrible la impresi√≥n.. no es lo que est√°n vendiendo ...
1.0,I ordered the yellow one true to size. It had no shape and the ruffle hits at the hips. I returned it. Quality was to be expected with the low price.
1.0,Gave this as a gift and it broke the next day made really cheaply but the price was cheap so what do you expect
1.0,"These stones feel plastic and are completely see through! Don't waste your money, extremely disappointing!!!!"
1.0,Lock started to tarnish in very little time.
1.0,It doesn‚Äôt come with the message on the card. It comes with a blank card. Cheap quality.
1.0,Very cheep looking. The wire used is very tight. Unfortable.
1.0,garbage!  It‚Äôs not even ok for donation. Cheap fabric and poorly sewed. Junk and waist of money.
1.0,I got this delivered  pretty fast. Bad part is one side of the hat is bent up so much if she puts it on and it looks horrible. I don't even know if I can fix it.
1.0,"Disappointed. 2 pairs of the pack came with holes in them. Other than that, they were great."
1.0,"I just ordered this a a suggestion from Amazon and I am completely disappointed, quality was not that good and the size completely wrong did you measure it, isn‚Äôt 5‚Äô long short."
1.0,Very cheap material. Do not fit well or zip easily
1.0,"Came wrong item ,"
1.0,"The shirt looks great before you wash it, the style is nice.<br />However, the 98% cotton thread is very thin so wrinkles terribly.<br />So expect to iron it every time you wear it.<br />The label states hand washing and line drying or drying on low heat.<br />It is quickly fading after 2 cold water washes.<br />I would recommend different shirts with a better fabric blend and heavier thread."
1.0,We returned this product. The color was horrible. The fabric was weird and it just did not look good on my daughter.
1.0,Pros:<br />NONE!<br /><br />Cons:<br />If you don't get metal poisoning from the high lead content it will only be because they fell apart completely before you could!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />JUNK! Returned the same day they arived.
1.0,"Arrived in an envelope.  Earrings were squished flat, and nearly ruined.  I had to manipulate them with my fingers to make the part where the fabric is inserted rounded again, but that wasn't all that difficult since the metal is thin and flimsy.  The metal is most definitely spray-painted gold.  Everything about these screams ""CHEAP JUNK"".  The photo online looks so much nicer than they look in person.  I was going to order two pairs and give one to my daughter.  I'm glad I only wasted money on one pair."
1.0,"I pay a fee for Prime to get free shipping, but this company charges, I paid 3.75 for shipping the band didn‚Äôt fit, so I had to pay $3.75 to send it back and then had to pay $3.75 to re-order, so in total I paid $42.00 for a 29.99 watch band, after all of that I found the same watch band a Best Buy for $19.99"
1.0,"Dislike, the material. Feel like plastic material. Also run small.. Didn't like the quality."
1.0,"Top is way too small, top fits like a B cup with little support for anything larger."
1.0,"I purchased two hats one black for myself and one blue for my wife.  Although my wife has a small head it is by no means small enough to fit in the hole provided.  The elastic is VERY tight and hurt her ears and head.  As you can see by the two hats side by side the head size is remarkably different.  I ordered a second blue hat just in case tight elastic was a quality control issue.  The new blue hat arrived just as small with very tight elastic.  Both were returned.  I really hate to give this review, but a look at the pictures proves the point.  The Black hat fits perfect and the quality is very good.  I could not possibly wear the blue hat with out cutting off the blood supply to my scalp."
1.0,The material was a weird blend that didn‚Äôt feel very nice. It also ran small.
1.0,"Didn‚Äôt fit me well, but it is cute."
1.0,this jacket is NOT the jacket you receive!!!! The jacket shown on picture is not what you get it. The jacket takes months to arrive and to receive it and it looked like S***. Do Not purchase. I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE THIS JACKET. If you do don't say I didn't warn y'all.
1.0,Not returnable unless you pay shipping!!!! Ordered an XL for an even more oversized look and what came was labeled an XL but it is actually like a medium.  It is a China XL but a US medium
1.0,Color is not as displayed....I bought the green but I looks more like a brownish green
1.0,Returning... way too small<br />Order a size up
1.0,It's not really comfortable
1.0,"This dress was poorly made with holes in some of the seams. Also on the black fabric the seams were sewn with white thread, very tacky!! I am not able to wear it and it‚Äôs too bad because it‚Äôs a cute style. Save your money!!"
1.0,"I got it on July 6, and wore it everyday.  Today (Aug 22)  I realized the elastic string is fray and getting loose.<br />Since I only noticed it after 30 days, and it is over the return time frame.<br />Sad, and lost my $20.<br />I would suggest to stay away."
1.0,"This looks like a 3rd grade art project.  It is FELT! Felt with some cheap things attached to it.  The clasp and metal connector don't even rise to the level of costume jewelry.  TERRIBLE!!!! I figure, I can wear it this halloween."
1.0,"When I opened the package this thing was as big as a 3XL. Well, I figured maybe since its 90% cotton it'll shrink to a large, which is the labeled size. Nope. This thing is an XL. Like some of the other reviewers have said, it's a big shapeless bag. If you're dead set on buying one, get a size smaller."
1.0,Dont waste your money on this. Dont waste your money on this. Dont waste your money on this.
1.0,"I guess u pay for what u get, very cheap"
1.0,Nice belt but when you Oder it is not for a &#34;normal&#34; figure. Maybe a preteen. I ordered XL and there is no way I could wear it. gave it to Goodwill.
1.0,Not sold as pictured. Prints in photos are not what were received.
1.0,Velcro has deteriorated way to quickly and now less that 20 times of wearing them the velcro no longer stays on. Front of brown has peeled off from gentle wear alone. Unfortunately the quality seems to be very low.
1.0,Is see through not thick material nothing what I expect to be like doesn't bring your butt out didn't like it
1.0,Way way way small and really thin fabric.  Jacket style/cut is nice but fabric is not nice.  Almost pajama polyester fabric.
1.0,I was very disappointed that this had no calorie ingredient information know how to make them nothing it was just a package of a product I have no idea how to use
1.0,Pants were way to thin you could see through them... returned
1.0,Ordered a size 12 at first. I had also ordered a Green Lantern ring in a size 12. The Green Lantern came first and fit on my ring finger. I wanted the Deadpool for my pointer finger which is slightly larger than my ring finger. I returned the size 12 Deadpool ring and ordered a size 13. Just received the second Deadpool ring today. The box says 13 but it is the same size as the size 12 I returned. This one is getting returned today as it does not fit my pointer finger.
1.0,Las patas de los lentes son muy abiertas
1.0,Thin fabric and very tight. Not as expected.
1.0,"The item came crammed into a very small plastic envelope and crinkles persist several days after being freed. What's worse, is a very dark brushed ink stain (mascara?) in the center of the scarf, on the lightest background.<br /><br />Do not order, especially for gifts, since you may get embarrassed, when they open the package. I am glad I opened it at home.<br /><br />There is a tag saying it is 40% silk and 60% polyester, with care instructions: wash in lukewarm temperature (30 degrees Centigrade), no bleach, do not tumble dry, iron on lowest setting (one dot), dry clean in any solvent except for trichloroethylene (P).<br /><br />I tried washing by hand  and removing the stain using alcohol - the stain is permanent. Maybe it is the same dark brown stain that was used to make the design. In this case it is a factory second, which should be marked as such."
1.0,"This costume should not be listed as one size fits most.  It would fit a petite woman or junior.  I am a size medium adult and it was very tight, with no stretch or give.  I am returning.  I would think it would fit size 2 or 4 women's max."
1.0,I had to return this item. It is too sheer for my taste.
1.0,"It‚Äôs okay, there‚Äôs no stretch to it, I ordered a large and fits like a extra small"
1.0,Do not buy this.  It is a fake and does not work.
1.0,This thing is flat out tiny!!! I ordered a 3x. As instructed by some of the reviews. I'm between a 2x and a xl. This thing was like trying to squeeze into a medium.  The fabric is ultra thin as well.  Returning it.
1.0,"So cheap and super high neckline not at all what pictures, so unhappy"
1.0,The photo on this ad is very misleading. Terrible quality and the material is nothing like it looked in the photo. The buttons are large white plastic buttons and look very cheap. Would not recommend.
1.0,Horrible fit. The holes for the breasts are way too big and there is absolutely no support. I will be returning.
1.0,"Here's what this watch winder has going for it: It is quiet. It is very pretty and appears to be well made. So what's wrong? It won't wind my husband's watch. I bought this about a month before our anniversary so by the time I gave it to him as a gift and we discovered that it won't wind his watch, the return window has closed and I'm now left with a seventy dollar paper weight. We tried every setting the winder has. We left the watch on there for weeks. It doesn't wind the watch. It won't even maintain the charge the watch has when it's put on the winder.  It IS quiet. And it's lovely. It just won't perform the function I purchased it for. My advice is that you don't buy this for a gift. By the time you've tried everything you can think of to make the winder work, you won't be able to return it."
1.0,"Stretched out immediately. Would not stay in place, very thin."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:8427f1652391a60d1f1de4aaf03b04e7]] I am so disappointed with this product,  is a poor quality,.I try to take out the puff. But it doesn't go away.. I would like my money back please"

1.0,"Bought an XL, wouldn't even fit a normal 12 yr old child. Very dissatisfied."
1.0,This item is not age appropriate. This is not the product I intended to purchase .
1.0,The clip wouldn't hold on to my shirts. It'll work for belts.
1.0,Waste of money. Designed for small or youth faces.
1.0,"The product itself is nice, but it is not worth the wait...and the wait...and the wait!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,The tassels are much bulkier looking and doesn't lay like the picture. It almost looks like there's extra tassels. The chain and everything about this necklace looks super cheap. Returned.
1.0,"the product was very<br />short , tight and uncomfortable"
1.0,Didn't fit me. So had to give it away to someone else.
1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy, they are very unflattering and not really stretchy, seller didn‚Äôt refund me, bad business."
1.0,"They describe the fabric as Modal., but it looks and fits like spandex to me, which I totally dislike. It looks much nicer in the picture too. I waited awhile to get this and it is not worth the wait. Glad it has a free return."
1.0,Feels like a cheap $5 watch you buy from Walmart.  It scratched within a week of having it (I am very careful and take good care of things.)<br />I noticed the fogging during a temperature change in south Florida and was told this is normal.  Sorry I can‚Äôt see a navy seal going to check the time while on a mission to siberia and not being able to see because it‚Äôs fogged.<br />So I decided I would have the watch repaired and resell on eBay/etc.  to fix the glass it‚Äôs $88<br />So I‚Äôve paid over $200 for a watch that I can only wear when the temps going to be consistent.<br />Save your money. This watch is garbage.
1.0,"mine looked like a tee shirt that  was a little longer and thick tee shirt material not the flowy material shown and it looks pleated and mine didn't have that all and runs small I could barely get it on, very very disappointed shame on the seller for such deception"

1.0,This shirt was make out of acetate material.<br />Did not like the quality of this. I was hoping for a cotton blend.  The fit was tight - I returned this shirt
1.0,Way too orange for my taste....
1.0,"I got the biggest size they had and still could not get them over my 20"" calves... And the description said 20-22""... So I gave them away because I felt that someone else might get some use out of them... But I will not be getting this brand again"
1.0,Liked the look but made very cheap. Torn already.
1.0,This has a very bad disgusting smell to it. Threw it away immediately. Do not put this on your child's body.
1.0,The umbrella was broken when attempted to use 3 months later-it is really small and allows for only 1 person with limited coverage.
1.0,In the first photo flow is coming apart.  second photo the back is filthy and the last picture the rings to the clasp dont match.  I will be donating - not worth my time sending back.  I got what I paid for - cheap!
1.0,No me agrado el size corren  muy peque√±as aunq. se escoja  la m√°s grande. Una sugerencia pienso deber√≠an de ofrecer tallas plus size o extras xxx L para que corran como size regulares ABCDo DD cups o m√°s grandes en la parte de atras.Gracias
1.0,My son loved these pants until they started falling apart after a couple washes.<br /> The waist tie eyelet rings fell off and the seam has started to come apart in the leg.<br />Great looking pants while they lasted tho.<br />Wish the return time was extended longer on these.
1.0,Way too long to be a beanie
1.0,"This outfit was so cute until, I stuck my hand down the pocket there was rip inside. Then I saw a rip on the both outside pockets and a rip on the front. The material is very thin but nice and bright."
1.0,"Super hard to put in my ears bc the posts are curved.  Also made my ears sore.  Once in, they looked cute, but was more of a struggle to put in than I would've liked."

1.0,Very small.. Nor for an adult
1.0,"100% Polyester, not viscose/spandex as in description."
1.0,This mask is tiny. I can't believe an adult could wear this comfortably unless you have a tiny head.
1.0,"This skirt was a total misrepresentation of the product I received. It was poorly made, with threads hanging everywhere along with the fact that it looked almost nothing like the picture. Buyer be aware! You totally get what you pay for."

1.0,The color was very different from the picture so I returned it.
1.0,I ordered a women's large and it arrived . But it is more like a med small. It also looks like a regular hoodie but it's made out of super thin fabric. Verry dissapointed
1.0,"Don't buy, not worth it. I ordered an XL andt was super large fit me like a dress and I wear a size 14."
1.0,One side wouldn‚Äôt clasp. Replacement was sent and the new band still had the same problem.
1.0,"I returned this because it was too small (I ordered an xl) but didn't repurchase because it has a seem down the middle of the whole shirt, very ugly to me but might be someone else's cup of tea."

1.0,"Well made coat,  the small must be  made for children . I take a  men""s size small I and couldn't even get the coat around me to attempt to zip .Could hardly get my arms through the sleeves."
1.0,Sad. The sizing was off by a size or too. It's too small.
1.0,"I thought these would be cute large frame fashion glasses with pink-tinted lenses. I was surprised to find they are more of a brown lens with a pinkish tint. Not what I envisioned based upon the product pic. Mine arrived damaged with one lens popping out and bent frames. They come with a pinch top pouch, so at least part of this product will be of some use."
1.0,Took forever to be delivered. Poor quality! Falling apart when I took it out of the bag! Don‚Äôt buy!!
1.0,"The stitching was off and I could not fit a single credit card in, returned it right away.  It also looked better on the picture."
1.0,"This is an awful product, of the 40 pcs 25 stop working within 10 minutes and 7 of them didn‚Äôt work at all."
1.0,"This shirts does not look like the picture. The picture shows a beautiful blouse this looks like something that you can buy at Rainbow. The sleeves itches, the fishing line that is used to add details to the collar and sleeves are poking out and sticking you while you are wearing it. The body of the blouse is form fitting with a little stretch to it. Bought it on 3/18 wore it on 4/9. Not one of my better purchases, I won't even attempt to return it and get a refund... I took the hit for you shoppers so you don't have to endure what I did . Do Not Purchase this item."

1.0,Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to even get the side off! Very annoyed about it don‚Äôt buy cheaply made.
1.0,Thought that it was supposed to be a necklace. It's an anklet!
1.0,The product quality appeared ok until I put it on. Sleeves were extremely too tight on the arms. The moment I put It on there was A hole in the dress from bad stitching. The color Is NOT vibrant like the photo. In all actuality it looks nothing like the photo to be honest. Very disappointed
1.0,finish wore off in less than a year of daily wear.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. I would have sent it back but didn‚Äôt have anything else to wear.
1.0,This not an authentic Tiffany product. The business selling this knock off item is ‚Äúyiwushijimaodianzishangwushanghang‚Äú ‚Ä¶.when you click on the hi-lighted Tiffany and co business link it takes you to the real sellers page.
1.0,Got them. Waaaaaayyy to small. Had them go back to their maker. Amazon still hit me with the full fee. :-(
1.0,"Total waste of money. Yes the sandals are comfy and they look cute right out of the box, but don't rub you foot against anything because it will remove the top sole layer, revealing a very white base."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt fit!! They run super small!!

1.0,Item is too small and broke to easy. I will never buy one again
1.0,"Oh golly, the worst fitted pair of jeans I have ever ordered!<br />They were baggy through the crotch and hip area. If I had a huge pair of saddle bags they may have fit. If that‚Äôs not bad enough they were fitted snugly over the calf... can‚Äôt you say riding britches?<br />These were jodhpurs!<br />Finally the cropped length was off, they were just about 2 inches of being the right crop length.<br />The stripes could have been cute, but these jeans are cut all kinds of ways wrong."
1.0,Chain broke within one hour.
1.0,Should have gotten xl lg way to small
1.0,"this is a very cheaply made product from china. I bought it to wear for virus protection, it is too thin, cheaply made. I would not recommend. oh and it took weeks getting to me."
1.0,The dress doesn‚Äôt even come close to the sizes that the seller states. I am a typical American 3X and I could barely fit an arm into the dress had to return.
1.0,"It‚Äôs not cotton. It‚Äôs a thin, silky polyester type of material. It‚Äôs poorly made, and the print doesn‚Äôt look anything like the pictures. Size fits good, but that‚Äôs about the only good thing."
1.0,Looks NOTHING like the photo. Shirt is very boxy square cut and front and back are same lengths. Zipper is on black material sewed into shirt. Very cheaply made.
1.0,This item is garbage. The quality is terrible and fits way too large. Coloring is completely off from the photo and there is no black inside lining like the picture leads you to believe. Stay away!!!!
1.0,"the quality of these earrings is terrible, there's still some metal hanging between the paw pads and the toes, and the metal itself has obvious flaws and bumps in it.<br /><br />as you can see, BOTH earrings dont even have a full round toe pad on the second toe."
1.0,Too dark. .looks brighter in the picture. Did not know the design was all hearts.  Did not like that.  Did not try it on.
1.0,This looked like somebody‚Äôs old grandma made this with some extra material that she had laying around the house! I didn‚Äôt like it. The material was cheapy like. I returned it.
1.0,I really liked this!  The 2nd time wearing it part of it came apart .  I‚Äôm sure I can fix it.

1.0,WAY TOO SMALL! not worth purchasing.
1.0,"They‚Äôre awful, honestly. They fell apart after one wear and they look terrible in person."
1.0,"Pictures are misleading. The actual necklace and earings are large, bulky and of poor quality. I would buy these from a dollar store but not more. Do not be misled by the images, you definitely get what you pay for on this one."
1.0,"la tela, la forma todo horrible. no se parece a la foto. P√©sima compra"
1.0,Too small too short. Bad quality material
1.0,run super small (length)
1.0,"cheap, cheap, cheap,  I could tell even before pulling them out of the plastic that they were very cheap fabric and cheaply made! Not worth $18, maybe $5, but if I wanna spend 18 plus shipping then I may as well go to a store and find quality ones for that price."
1.0,"The absolute worst thing I have received. I could have bought this for $0.50. It‚Äôs broken, missing a stone, and extremely flimsy. Do not waste your money"
1.0,Terrible thin fabric.
1.0,Came with all of the seems inside completely broken and the plastic adjustment on the back was not secured into the hat.
1.0,"Both earrings arrived broken, the flowers were completely detached from the posts."
1.0,"This leotard, size 8-10, was too small for my 7-year-old, average size, granddaughter. She was very dissapointed."
1.0,"I wear size 39 inch shorts, so I ordered the XXL shorts. After receiving my shorts I tried them on and they are way too small. If I had to guess, the XXL (38-40) might fight 32 or 34 inch waist. I also noticed that the crouch stitching was subpar.<br /><br />Shipment took 18 day from China"
1.0,"Similar to a previous bracelet purchase, the latch doesn't lock properly, therefore, the bracelet falls off so I don't even bother to wear it. Waste of money. Disappointed because I want to wear it and show it off, but cannot for fear of it falling off and being lost."
1.0,The edges is too narrow not enough to block the sun.
1.0,If I could give it a 0 I would. Its total trash. Made out of plastic and tissue paper. The plastic adjustment on the sailor hat was broken off. Threw in the trash
1.0,"I turned back after one week's wearing, it is in bad quality."
1.0,I bought this item and hoping it would fit but it was so tight and snug. The fabric was not great either.
1.0,"This dress was VERY VERY cheaply made.  I guess I should have expected that for the price.  It fit weird - size wise it was fine, but it had gaps in certain places, and just didn't look nice at all.  I have returned the item, and ended up wearing something I already owned to a wedding I had."
1.0,Very large and the ball fell off the first day and lost the earring
1.0,Super thin (like nylons!) and came with a hole. Returning!
1.0,"large, very pretty with the rose gold setting<br /> August 2018 update: unfortunately the setting of these earrings has turned dull and causes a very large green area on the entire ear lobes when worn - and is very difficult to remove! It's too bad, as the stone is still very pretty. Have tried cleaning, but to no avail üòê"
1.0,"This would be my third purchase of these pants, first time they fit great and I still love them, second time they were probably 3-4 sizes too small figured that was just an accident so I ordered them again, made sure to check the tag and it said 2x so I thought I was good until I tried them on and they were a little too tight and way too short. Will be sending these back, and I would definitely not recommend that you purchase from this seller/company."
1.0,Inside pocket tore through after using for 1 week. Like bro 1 week
1.0,Not a fan. Color looks like a very glamorous goldish tone in the picture but in reality  it is more of a pale yellow. Material is very very flimsy and cheaply made. Will be returning.
1.0,False & Misleading advertising ü§¨ I want my money back. Waited for over a month for crystal to receive a rock and no where near the carats that are advertised. Highly dissatisfied and not looking forward to the other 2 crystals I ordered from youüò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨üëéüèæ
1.0,broke in one day
1.0,So upset it was broken in 3 places.
1.0,"Received item completely broken. I was able to piece the charm itself back together but there‚Äôs nothing to do about the broken chain. Disappointed, but at least it was cheap I guess."
1.0,How dare this man be compared to only God and Lord Jesus Christ!<br /><br />how dare you !
1.0,"I originally gave a two star because I didnt like that they were too long and didnt fit right but since then 1 star, one ring broke off into pieces while I was out and could t find it, another jammed under the clicker hole and how to be pried out of my nose with pliers. Returning."
1.0,The material is incredibly cheap and uncomfortable. I‚Äôm consistently a medium and ordered my normal size but I could have probably sized down twice. I‚Äôm returning and I recommend saving your money. What you get is not worth the price.
1.0,Fit. Is good.  Soles fell apart after about 2 months.  Very cheap construction.
1.0,"Warning: Do not buy from this company. The photo is not representative of what you are buying. It shows a cotton printed shirt. What you get is a plastic polyester printed garment. Not wearable fabric, not breathable as the cotton in the photo. There is no drape. It's cut out of thick cheap polyester. The advertising is completely misleading. Sizes are too small because there is no stretch as cotton would have."
1.0,Fell apart literally after using it twice.
1.0,"Thin material, not put together well, and cheap. If that's cool with you then get them. If you have any strength at all, you're going to tear into these like a fat kid into cake"
1.0,"I‚Äôm surprised Nike would even put their name on this product. The quality of the fabric is poor. It feels rough to the touch and the fit is ridiculously tight, even the sleeves. Anyone who is really working out and sweating does not want a clingy, tight shirt. Yuck. Hated it through and through."
1.0,Only received 1 earring.
1.0,"I was really excited about this until I received it and tried it on. Really poor fit for taller girls. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and it awkwardly came to a point at the outer side of each pant leg. Also I took the advise from the reviews and sized up only to be very disappointed with the fit of the pants around the crotch area. The top fit okay, but it wasn‚Äôt good enough for me to keep for the price."
1.0,"The material is not chiffon. It's not even close to chiffon. It's this weird waffle-scratchy-gauze material that reminds me of a terrible hospital gown. It's also made short and wide, so not really tunic length, but really baggy on the sides."
1.0,An arm broke off the first time I put them on.
1.0,"It's very high waisted, in easily wrinkled, slippery fabric. It's all just a big mess."
1.0,Cut way to low
1.0,Really? Wouldn‚Äôt fit my Barbie doll. Teeny tiny.
1.0,"Not only was this jacket not waterproof, it was extremely thin and cheaply made.  Came in a ball of wrinkled mess.  Recommend you keep looking."
1.0,Biggest piece of JUNK ever!
1.0,"These shoes are not comfortable at all, with no arch support.  The material feels flimsy.<br />Then, the seller has lousy shipping and return policy.  I had to pay for shipping both ways.  They also charged restocking fee.<br />Anyway, no way I'm keeping these shoes."
1.0,Nice colors and the size is right but these started to slip within minutes of putting them on.
1.0,"I ordered the color white 1, and it does not look anything like the displayed picture.  When i chose the color white 1, the display picture looked beige, so I thought that is what it would look like.  When i received it, the jacket was white.  It is very soft, have lining in the the back and on the inside of the sleeves.  The lining on the sleeves is longer than the sleeves when i wear it.  It does not look professional.  It looks very casual.  I ordered a size medium and it did fit.  The medium fits close, so if you do not want it to close too your body order up a size."
1.0,Got this as a gift for mom. It was lovely until it turned and the sliver rubbed off. Should have looked for something Stirling Sliver.
1.0,I liked the bracelet but it broke and went everywhere.  Cheap.
1.0,"The fit was nonexistent. Not flattering and boxy, after one wear out was falling apart so much so that I had string tailing behind me at my event."
1.0,"One leg is shorter than the other, approximately 3 inches. The fabric is not soft."
1.0,Order a xxl and the waist line is a 9
1.0,The fit is too small. I'll buy 2 sizes bigger if I choose this vendor
1.0,"I got this for my grandmother's birthday. This gift looked gorgeous on the outside! When I gave it to her, she said it was the most unique, beautiful gift anyone had ever given her. It had a little shell, a pearl to put in the locket, and it was kind of like a ritual where you got the knife and opened it, made your wish, and put it in the locket. It was perfect (a little difficult). After a little while it came apart. Didn't last long at all."
1.0,This is a counterfeit pin based off of the original Linda Panda Catpuccino pin. Don‚Äôt support this knock off.
1.0,"I have both the 3/4 and full length Little Donkey Andy pants, size Large. Both of those products are excellent. These shorts are a different stretch fabric that isn't as comfortable and are ill fitting. The front pockets are ""puffy"" and the belt is a joke. Not recommended"
1.0,"The fabric feels extremely cheep. It is very poorly down, loose string everywhere. I bought a Small, it fits very loose, like a medium or large, the only thing that makes it ‚Äúsmall‚Äù is the length of it. It‚Äôs very square. It says it‚Äôs slim fit but it‚Äôs extremely baggy. Overall a terrible purchase."
1.0,Not as pictured. No gathering and ties at side of legs
1.0,Could not try it on because the zipper was sewn into the seam incorrectly!
1.0,Liked it but did not love it. So I returned it. When I say small I ordered a size up just as reviewers stated it was still to small in the arms especially.
1.0,Broke after only 5 days.
1.0,Smaller than what I expected won't order agsin
1.0,This shirt runs about 2 sizes small and is not a sweatshirt as advertised.  It is extra thin tshirt material.
1.0,"This belt is so teeny, I doubt it would fit a young girls waist.  I wear a medium in most clothes, size 8, small waist.  This belt has very little stretch and give, and after an hour of wearing was very uncomfortable.  This is the second belt I have ordered that ships from China that is completely off on sizing.  I will be returning ASAP.  Shipping was quick though, packaging good."
1.0,Runs super small. I am a 36DD and ordered by size chart and the cups only cover half my boobs. Terrible fit and super flimsy
1.0,No support built in! I've never worn them!
1.0,"This would be a nice little set for 5-9$, but, is WAY overpriced for what you get. The quality is terrible. this was meant to be a gift but I would never give it to the person because they would think that I purchase their gift at the dollar store..."
1.0,Hated these. Feels like plastic underwear.
1.0,Extremely poor quality! Had less than a week and case broke the first time it fell on a semi soft surface. Would never recommend!!!
1.0,"The dress came with the lace discolored. Some ot look black, some navy & some was a faded blue with a purple tint. The arms were fitted too tight for the size. I am trying to send it back for refund but since it is in China you have to pay the freight. Not what I expected from the photos. :("
1.0,Write up regarding slippers indicated that they were made in Australia.
1.0,"I never even got to wear it once, since the catch on the band broke the very first time I tried it on.  Very disappointed, as I loved the watch, otherwise.  Threw it in the garbage.  ;-("
1.0,"At a glance, anyone should be able to see that it is impossible for these to work.  They lack the very basic technology needed for good binocular vision.  Look at a pair of REAL binoculars...see how the front and back lenses are offset from each other? That is because there are some form of prism in them that allows your two eyes to see the same image.  See how the eyepieces are very small? That is because it needs to be about the same size as your eye's dilated pupil to allow the focused image to actually enter your eye.  See how there is distance between the objective lens (furthest from eyes)and the eyepiece? That is because lenses have a focal length, which is related to the distance the lens needs to be from your eye in order to see a focused image...different sizes and shapes of lenses require different distances.  Zoomies obviously have none of this.  A little bit of science goes a long way."
1.0,"These shoes are shoes are garbage. 1st, they look nothing at all like the photo.  2nd, they literally show up in a bag, not even a box.  3rd, when I opened the bag I got the overwhelming smell of PVC. 4th, cheap construction from China, poorly made, thin sole, cheap eyelets, cheap laces, arrived damaged, so probably wont last but a few wears. Stay away."
1.0,Ped√≠ 2x porque es mi talla y me llego mas peque√±a aunque La sudadera dice 2x creo q en esta tienda las tallas vienen muy muy peque√±as tendre q regresarlaüò•
1.0,False advertisement! Says it has the ear holes but it doesn‚Äôt. Too small. NOT FOR MEN!
1.0,"Look how long those chest straps are!!! They just hang to your belly button, nothing like the photo where they outline your breasts. So ridiculously long like they don‚Äôt give a crap about their customers and trying to make what they sell us!! Beyond mad at being scammed!!  You can see from placement just placed randomly inside where the front tie criss crosses! It would be so easy to add straps like their photo that‚Äôs what makes me feel scammed. Almost takes more effort to do it like this then to make it correctly like their photo."
1.0,Purchased these for picture day and it was a bust! They had a white stain or mark on them. And it was a huge inconvenience to have to go to the store the day before picture day to look for a pair of pants. I returned these back.
1.0,"Very sheer and small. I ordered a size bigger but it‚Äôs still too short, tight in the hips but very low cut. Spend the money on something more expensive with better fabric."
1.0,"Thought they would be cute for the youngsters in the house with the little hands holding onto their glasses. They do look good, unfortunately the soft silicone cord ‚Äúgrabs‚Äù hair and will not let go. The youngsters were not happy and to add insult to injury I had to put baby powder on the back of their head to release the cord. Still lost some hair in the processing."
1.0,These were all wayyyyyy too big for my neck! I am 5'6 and 110 lbs......Just a warning for everyone - Jane Anne
1.0,Very poor quality. Strings coming out all over the bikini and i haven‚Äôt even worn it once.
1.0,i dont like how its loose
1.0,I thought like I was swallowed in this dress
1.0,"I got these for when i work on lights, didnt need them for a few weeks, but when i did, they broke within the first week of use. The glasses are tight on the head and while putting them on, the stress broke the frame.  I got these for work to go over my glasses to work on Lights. Very little stress on glasses, frame is just brittle. 30 days were up, so I guess I just have to deal with it. Not expected for the cost of the glasses."
1.0,"This product comes in pieces, with 3 little plastic gizmos for each end. There are no instructions. I'm an engineer and I cannot figure out how to assemble this thing. It is worthless to me."
1.0,Poor material Poor Quality Looks like a sleeping cloths don't buy
1.0,Chain is bad quality and ripped on the first day I wore it. Would not buy again.
1.0,"Item arrived with an LPN label (a return) and the interior contents had obviously been ripped apart and half hazardly thrown back together.<br />Paying as much as I am for these, I would expect a brand new item, not something someone else returned"
1.0,"Well, lets just say. I cancelled this order with the seller before Christmas(a day after I place it)and just recieved it about a week ago with no return information. He even confirmed my cancellation asking if I would like to switch it with another. Kind of peeved, but don't need to be bothered right now to ship it back. I will find someone to give it to. Originally I was buying it as a gift for a friend, but she had one almost just like it."
1.0,"Half of these earrings have the screws on the wrong side, which means that if I want to wear them, I have to put them in from the back of my ear. I tried switching them around, but even with pliers, it's not happening."
1.0,Was comfortable but had a  strong chemical smell.  Returned for refund.
1.0,Blurry as heck!
1.0,I would give zero stars if I could. Material was horrible and see through  returned as soon as I opened the package
1.0,Not fit. Doesn't stay<br /> Returned
1.0,"Do not purchase! The shirt is nothing like the picture shown; it is very poorly made sleeves are short, the fabric is extremely cheap and way too small. When ordering I took into consideration the fact that they are claiming Asian sizing so I ordered 2 sizes larger. I felt like the incredible hulk and with any movement, I would have torn the loosely sewn shirt. Since returning I am still waiting for a refund after almost 2 weeks!"
1.0,Read the reviews went up a size. Got this today. It is sooo small. Absolutely no stretch. Would like to return and go up yet another size but not sure if that would fit either.
1.0,"It‚Äôs smaller than it was pictured, was able to fill it up to the top but walking home it was damaged with holes I had to carry! It good for short ppl whose under 4ft tall not for 5‚Äô3‚Äù won‚Äôt get again ‚òπÔ∏è"
1.0,Dude can't be serious... Just threw them away
1.0,This was a laughably small fit for choosing my correct bra size.
1.0,It doesn‚Äôt center in the middle of my but in the back so basically i can‚Äôt wear it poorly made waist of moneo
1.0,Sizing was completley  wrong.
1.0,"The lenses are not mirrored and on a sunny day, it looks like the lenses are clear. It actually looks ridiculous. I do not recommend purchasing these."
1.0,I wanted to love this shirt.  It's quite boxy and didn't hang/drape off my shoulder the way I wanted it to.  The head/neck opening is quite slim.  It's hit and miss with ordering clothes from A.  This one was a miss.
1.0,I didn‚Äôt have high hopes for it considering the price point but come on...this was literally laughable. Do not waste your time buying this and having to send it back.
1.0,The fabric is very thin. The length is very long. Unless you are very tall alterations will be needed.
1.0,Can't return cuz I moved and it is way too small.
1.0,It‚Äôs just too large
1.0,Poor quality and look cheapest
1.0,"Doesn't actually look like the pictures...Tried to return the two swimsuits that i ordered due to sizing, i was offered 1/2 off of my re order."
1.0,I like the color of the dress I like the design of the dress the dress was too big for me and I actually got a large it would‚Äôve been a good church dress I just didn‚Äôt like how it looked on me wasn‚Äôt flattering so I sent it back but maybe somebody else would look great in it but I just didn‚Äôt so the dress is just OK
1.0,"Discoloration in fabric upon arrival, had a faint purple tint to the white shirt"
1.0,"This is a TINY stone & the chain is not very nice either, you can't really slide the stone up & down the chain.  Not a good buy for the price"
1.0,Didn't expect much for the price. But it should not be listed as kids watch. It id way to big unless Popeye Jr. is going to to wear it.
1.0,Does not look the same at all. The badge stuck to the Velcro is the original version and the lighter badge on top of the bag is what I was sent. I wish I could give this zero stars because what I received looks nothing like what was advertised!
1.0,U get what u pay for. Super cheap. Stone weren't glues center.
1.0,Had to remove  a link wore the band for couple hours pin came out and lost the fitbit and band would not buy this again
1.0,"Was excited when we saw how it worked and all the different colors and patterns of the lights, BUT my 10-year old daughter only got to wear these shoes for about a week or two before the lights stopped working in one of the shoes and halfway worked in the other, even after charging all night. Was a Christmas present. So disappointing."
1.0,Don't waste your money.  Fabric wears/tears after two uses on bottom (see picture).  Poorly designed and improper located protection feet.  Swiss Gear refuses to stand behind their warranty and claims this is damage due to mishandling.
1.0,"I purchased diamond hoops from Dazzling Rock in the past and they were great; however, these ruby earrings were very disappointing.  The earrings were a different setting than shown and the rubies were so small I could bately see that they were red.  They were returned for a refund, but I will consider Dazzling Rock in the future."
1.0,dose not  look like it dose in the picture
1.0,Odd looking in the front once you put it on.
1.0,"I would give this zero stars if I could. This turned on me after just a week of wear. I wore it 24/7, in the shower, everything. That‚Äôs my intended use. I will find another one to replace this one. If you just want this for a one-off, it will work."
1.0,Chart is wrong
1.0,Printed feathers on cheap fabric. Waste of money and I had to pay shipping!  Was also shoved into a box and now all out of shape.
1.0,"It was way larger than i wanted it, but i felt it will take a long time to return it back and get the new size of it so i decided just to keep it and maybe give it to a friend."
1.0,So I ordered these and was super stoked because they were cute and the large would fit me perfectly! Well I was completely wrong!! My hips are 40 (which would be a large) and these were like a small. I ended up giving them to my daughter. The size chart that they made with a description of sizes (which I attached) is way off. It's so frustrating especially when you find something you really like and it comes to you and it's not as described.
1.0,It is to big .if it was half size it was perfect.
1.0,Nowhere close to 180 db as advertised.  Total garbage
1.0,These are beautiful but they are super tiny. I was so disappointed.
1.0,It is more like a long tee than a dress.
1.0,Returned on first day. Very cheaply made. Not worth a price
1.0,"Fine, cheap glasses. Nothing wrong with them. Look good. But literally the only reason I bought them was for the polarized aspect. These ARE NOT POLARIZED. It's in the title and everything, but still not polarized. Don't get me wrong, they would be fine for like 5-8 bucks. But I was essentially tricked into buying these falsely advertised &#34;polarized glasses.&#34;"
1.0,Was shipped in a bag and arrived mis-shapen/dented. I‚Äôve tried to get it back to it original shape. I bought the burgundy color. The color is good but the pic DOES SHOW A SILK-SCREENED IMAGE. But what arrives is a cheap iron on. Bummer! Don‚Äôt buy-keep looking
1.0,Epic fail. See thru. Fits odd. Not for plus size women. Returned
1.0,The watch was way too small
1.0,Cheap and flimsy .packaged badly.
1.0,Terrible fell apart after less than a week
1.0,Product was smaller than I thought and missing the chain
1.0,Hinges. Plastic not very strong. They easily broke
1.0,Broke after about three weeks
1.0,Comfortable pant but if you carry anything heavy in your pockets then the friction tighten belt slips causing the pants to slip downward. The belt is built in and another belt cannot be substituted for the original. I have two pairs and the same problem exists with both.
1.0,"There are only yellow and bronze starfish, nothing colored like the picture. Lame"
1.0,"The description says that the material is 95% Cotton, 5% Spandex, but the tag says 95% Cotton, 5% Polyester. It may be a misprint, but I cannot trust it."
1.0,It was cute when it arrived. Then I washed it per instructions and it's TINY! It's not useable. I'm very disappointed.
1.0,The shorts are sized horribly.
1.0,Junk. Husband wore it twice and it broke.
1.0,Received the bracelet and the clasp was broken. Bought it for a funeral and I was so disappointed .
1.0,Cheap piece of crap took forever to ship. At least my daughter thinks it is pretty.
1.0,"Fits good, but not the same color as in the picture but I will deal with it. Very disappointing that I did not get the color I wanted. Probably will not be ordering clothes on line because almost all of the six shirts I ordered that day have something wrong. Still waiting on one."
1.0,"Not a fan at all, the embroidery looks pretty but the fabric on the jumpsuit is thin and easy to see through! Item returned."
1.0,Very cheap material. Runs very small and I am returning it.  I should have ordered 2 sizes bigger. Small waist
1.0,Received the watch and didn‚Äôt work?
1.0,It is not cinched in the front as pictured.
1.0,This watch is too small to wear the way it is in the picture.
1.0,Material is great...but the middle belt section is not stretchy at all so I could hardly get it over my upper body. Don't buy!
1.0,This is supposedly meant for the fenix 2 but it isn't compatible at all.
1.0,My daughter has purchased replacement bands for her watch about once a year.  We ordered the red one and it fit perfectly and felt great but cracked within the first week of using it.
1.0,"It should be stated that it doesn‚Äôt fit small hands, so gave it away üòñ"
1.0,"Very poorly made, was too small & bought a size too big. This ships from overseas & took weeks to arrive. The dress was open at the shoulder seam & torn, I took it to a seamstress and she was unable to sew it back."
1.0,Size too large. Looks like a regular size pair of glasses.
1.0,This cover-up is NOT white. It is a light beige yellow color.  And it has a strong mildew smell. I will be returning it.
1.0,Got them in mail. Immediately returned. I laughed. The fabric and quality is nothing like the photo. Nothing but wrinkles and poor stitching. Cheapest fabric imaginable.
1.0,"I ordered a Khaki colored skirt and got a Cream colored skirt which is not even a given option when ordering. I saw another reviewer saying the samething. This is a uniform skirt for school my daughter needed, we waited a long time for it to come in the mail, then it comes in the wrong color and fabric is also VERY cheap and very thin, almost see through. The fabric is not thick like discribed in the description and the shorts underneath are see through. Horrible product, not happy for pay $22"
1.0,"No queda bien, las mangas no caen y la falda muy larga ajusta en la cintura"
1.0,"Absolutely awful customer service and the top is nothing as expected.  I would give the company another try, only they have ignored my request to return.<br />They have cute things just not this product."
1.0,Smelled horrible and toxic. Left then to air out outside for several days and the smell was still there. Returned.
1.0,"I'm 5'4"" and this is at least 4 inches too long. I can't wear it. It's a $ loss. Didn't realize this until the time for refund expired. Live and learn!!!"
1.0,Poorly made. Fake suede & Shetland. The Shetland falls off & sticks to your clothes.<br />Returning immediately
1.0,Poor and cheap quality. The silicon is ‚Äúoily‚Äù and the clasps are flimsy.
1.0,"Poor quality, looks crappy."
1.0,Too small.  The tag said &#34;one size&#34; even thought there were size choices when ordering.
1.0,3piece pant suit did not fit  pants one size top another duster another
1.0,These are not a proper mask. The whole thing constantly falls apart. I ended up throwing them away.
1.0,"Terrible fit, tiny in size, not stretchy at all, weird fit and cut, skirt smelled funny, overall terrible. Returning"
1.0,I purchased this hat for my grandson for Halloween night I spent $17 hours on this hat to have it arrive defective. It does not light up now I should not have to go and buy new batteries to check and see if that is in fact what the problem is the product should come working very unimpressed with this company
1.0,The shirt is not correct in size. The bear pealed off after one wash. I ended up just using the shirt as a rag! I wish I didn't spend money on this shirt!
1.0,Bottom of bag is not solid or hard allowing tools to scatter around and bag is poorly put together. Wish I hadn't bought it.
1.0,"Only one lens is polarized and after the first use, I threw it away, others are not comfortable too."
1.0,Seriously? no kidding people were talking about the cups...I ordered a 38B and it ended up feeling like a 40 F....it it was even a 38 C feel I might have kept it and just stuffed it...but it also doesn't exactly provide support either...I wanted this bra because of the wide band (I got enough boob fat so to make more boobs I did not want and thought this would be it)
1.0,"It‚Äôs not pleated, could hardly open the mouth, there‚Äôs no space to breathe. Not recommended. Sorry!"
1.0,Despues de un mes de uso se empezo a dehilar y el material no es como el de una cinta negra
1.0,"Hmmm,, how to review<br />I would never wear because it's too short. Not the length shown...and I'm short-5'2 1/2 , I'd LOVE to know the size of this model? I even stretched and stretched thinking it will grow..not. Seriously, how tall is the model?<br />Bottom drawer"
1.0,I bought this necklace set and the pearl one broke when I took it off. I am very upset as I had the necklace for 5 minutes so it is clearly low quality. I would like to receive a new pearl necklace as I paid money and cannot even wear it.
1.0,Very disappointed in the color. The picture shows a ruby reddish color almost see through. The Carnelian that came with my order is a dark brown and looks nothing like advertised.
1.0,Useless. You'd be better off just wearing a sweater.
1.0,"Besides being sized for a child, there was no inner tie. Ridiculous."
1.0,Not what I was expecting it doesn‚Äôt look like the pic not good
1.0,"The men's large pants tore at the crotch, in both pairs purchased. With my husband and son the pants didn't even last 24 hours. Really disappointed."
1.0,these slippers are for wide feet
1.0,It came folded so small that I could not get the creases out.
1.0,"Unfortunately I need a thicker quality of dress. Cheap piece of cotton, not worth my purchase."
1.0,"Not what the pic looks like at all. Its not stretchy. It has a zipper in the back. Its tight. Not what I was expecting. Also, you need to order a size up. Very disappointed."
1.0,"They're too big, even though I thought I'd be good. They don't stay on. üòû They're pretty disappointing."
1.0,"***Nothing like the photos.***<br />Pink butterfly shirt is much darker in person. It is also VERY cropped. I ordered a large and it Barely covered my chest. Collar is also different. Black moon shirt is super boxy, not fitted like the photo. Sleeves are Way too short and one is even a few inches shorter than the other. Returning both."
1.0,Tried to return item. They sent a mailing label in Chinese. Post office would not accept.<br />Not sure what to do at this point.
1.0,Necklace has no sparkle and arrived tarnished.
1.0,Not waterproof. Band broke. In the trash after 3 weeks.
1.0,It was cheap thin fabric so it didn‚Äôt hang.  It clung
1.0,Terrible quality and terrible fit.
1.0,"I usually don't leave negative reviews, but this thing would fit a 7 year old! I cannot even get my arms in it. Very disappointing."
1.0,It says Cotton and they‚Äôre all 100% silk extremely disappointed.
1.0,"Don‚Äôt ever buy from these sellers!!!!<br />Made of cheapest material, rough under the foot so the child cannot walk with it! No grip under the shoe ! Just a bad deal altogether! Very disappointed! I will never use this company again!"
1.0,"Very poor quality; don't waste your money here. The sock had a hole in the toe at the end of the first day of wearing it, and the seller is unwilling to do anything to help."
1.0,The material was corse and the shirt was huge. I bought the item as a gift (off the gift recipient‚Äôs list). The seller offered to refund 20%. I did that instead of the hassle of a full return.
1.0,The  scarf is very small
1.0,"It's child sized, and not slouchy at all. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Not as described. These are vinyl nitrile blend not all nitrile as described. Not happy with these. Don't stretch, rip easy."
1.0,Popped very easily after 2 days
1.0,"Completely different bikini bottoms and the size runs super small !! The color was the only thing that was correct. Amazon need to take this listing down, completely false advertising !! And a waste of my time !!"
1.0,"I lasted one day - cute, but the card slots don't have an end, so by the time you get to even the middle, good luck getting those cards out, especially past the flaps of material inside the pockets . . . . .I was wondering why it was so cheap - that would be why.  I donated it to Goodwill after using it one day."
1.0,This dress is not flattering. It shows every bump you may have. The material is thin. Actually the dress has very little shape. I returned this.
1.0,Watch looks amazing and solid..after one week with very light use its starts to fade the color and becoming black..soon I'll upload some photos.
1.0,They were much larger than expected and too slippery to wear in wet grass. An accident waiting to happen.
1.0,Necklace broke all over the place the first time I wore it At work and I lost it all:(
1.0,so  so
1.0,I love the material and even the bottoms. And I know sizes don‚Äôt run true.  But this was kid sized . It literally fitmy 9 year old daughter on the top half.  And I ordered a size large. If you are smaller chested this will look amazing. But anything above a b cup it won‚Äôt look good or fit.
1.0,Beautiful but I received it with the stitching starting to come apart (showing) at the neck line. Sending back.
1.0,Both broke within 5 minutes.  Not worth the $$
1.0,"waist doesn't seem tight enough, even tied to slides down"
1.0,Chain was not strong it broke in two days
1.0,"did not came in as described. iit said &#34;one-size&#34;, and you'll assume it will fit everyone. the shirt stay was too short, and I'm only 5'7. so i have to stretch it more than i regularly do to other brands that I own.. which makes it hard for you to move, ie: sit down and get up, raise your arms, reach for something. i suggest buying the military style shirt stay. it's longer and adjustable. save $"
1.0,I was very disappointed that the item that came was not the item pictured. The details are not comparable. This is very misleading and a waste of money.
1.0,This item was nothing g like it showed to be. Fits wierd. It is almost like a shirt not a dress. Chest fits odd. Company want to refund cause too far away. Not my problem.
1.0,"Poor quality, it tore when I tried it on. It wasn't too big or too small just the buttons made the entire shirt tear, I was so upset."
1.0,Poor quality.  Free return ONLY if I take to UPS drop.  Not indicated previously.
1.0,Earrings didn‚Äô Look anything like the picture. They were very dull with flaws.
1.0,The bow clip fell apart in my hands and the needle almost stabbed my fingers.
1.0,They are great for sleeping with but whatever is under the gold isn't gold. Likely brass and it tarnished after a week. Very disappointed. I wouldn't have purchased these if I had known they were an overlay. My ears are sensitive and I had a new piercing and they didn't irritate my ears (old or new holes) but I felt like they should have been clearly marked that it was 14k over brass or whatever it is cause it's misleading. The backs are very tiny but I found them not difficult to put on with a bit of practice. Definitely want to keep the stopper on the sink shut and use a well lit area to put them on in case you drop the back. Kinda wish the post was longer too as I felt the screw a few times when putting them on or cleaning them.
1.0,"First time having them on and they just fell apart while putting them on.  I was pushing them onto my face since water was getting in and the eye piece just popped out.  Tried to put it back together and it popped out again.  It is cheaper then cheap goggles you get at CVS.  They felt great on the face, super sad they don't work!"
1.0,Not good quality shirt
1.0,Cheap chain broke in the first week
1.0,This hat is just too cute for words! But it is way too small! I purchased it for my 6 month old son and I ordered the 6 to 12 months size. It does not fit him. His head may be a little large but definitely not larger than a 12 month old. So disappointed because this hat would have been adorable on him.
1.0,"I rarely order something too large. I tend to read the reviews before purchases. According to the size chart & the reviews, a Large should have been just right (I am an L-XL in most things). This dress was actually baggy on me, apparently I needed a medium.<br /><br />Also, according to the pictures the blue one should have had a longer skirt, it didn't. I ended up looking like a prostitute who couldn't even afford a dress that fit. If you want to look like a hooker, this is the dress for you!<br /><br />*Note: the material used was soft*"
1.0,Small like a quarter
1.0,Big and heavy!!
1.0,Felt very cheap and came in the wrong size
1.0,Big fan of Laurel Burch since the 70's. Couldn't get it over my head so small. Must be made in Taiwan. Disappointed. This is the 2bd time I've bought this shirt. The largest size is XXL. I've list 60 lbs since last year so I figured it would fit this time. Nope. No way. XXL is like a medium. I wear Large and I couldn't get this past my shoulders. Also live in Florida where it's hot & humid most of the year. The material is like wearing a plastic bag. Fabric does not breathe. Both times I was forced to return.
1.0,Very thin and undurable. Too small and too short
1.0,I ordered this according to sellers description of measurements. It was a lot smaller and the fabric has no stretch at all. Order at least 1 size bigger than the measurements tell<br />You. They are not accurate.
1.0,"Please don‚Äôt waste your money. Instead of black as the picture as the picture shows, my shirt arrived in brown where you see black. But it didn‚Äôt even have brown or black surrounding the neck and sleeves. The shirt is the same color all over."
1.0,Made short cheap and thin had strings peeling off before I tried them on super disappointed
1.0,Color does not match picture
1.0,The shorts I received look nothing like the picture. Horrible!!
1.0,Trash! battery dead and cheaply made.
1.0,This item has the words &#34;wifey&#34; embrodered across the front. For me this made it completely unwearable. I reviewed again the picture and the description and this was nowhere in either.  Disappointment and now inconvenienced with having to return the item and get something else.
1.0,Not bite resistant. Very thin and allows even the smallest teeth to pierce your skin.
1.0,Misleading
1.0,"First, the description is wrong....EASY TO USE ‚Äì Comfortable to wear and easy to insert these durable barbells helix piercing can be screwed at the front. well made‚Äì The colorful cz fasten tightly but unscrew smoothly making the ear cartilage studs are easy to use......well the back ball is what unscrews which is fine for earlobe or helix or somewhere easy access to back of earrring but for me, I have major difficulty with that style for tragus piercing and I was excited when the description said the front screwed and the colorful cz fasten tightly.  Nope.  Comparing this bar to others of my 16 guages I would say it's 18 bc it is smaller. But that is no where in description either  even though the length is nice length and the cz are pretty it's a return for me.  You do get a pair of each 12 colors in pic"
1.0,Looks absolutely nothing like the picture.<br />I should have listen to the reviews. What I received looks like a plain white short sleeves t-shirt. Picture is deceiving.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:a7105e53ea314f26210230b549763eb4]] The material shown in the picture is not the material of the actual item at all. I was hoping that it wouldn‚Äôt be a dud..
1.0,This only looks good online not in person. And it runs reall small.
1.0,I ordered a women‚Äôs large and it would have fit my 10 year old perfectly. Sent them back...
1.0,Muy trasparente si no tienesxun cuerpo bien formado lactela no hayuda a ormar el cuerpo
1.0,"There is NO bling to this mask and the butterfly is dull and faint. Also, the mask is oddly constructed and fits poorly. Plus it's way too big for women. I wouldn't be caught dead in it."
1.0,The lines do not match up and it does not look right in the most obvious of areas.  I loved the fit but returned it because it looked cheap given the material so off on the design.
1.0,Purchased for my mother who wears size 8.  She said they slide off her heels and thus makes them useless for her.
1.0,This mask is hard to breath through. And very big too
1.0,This was ordered 11/16/19 and just arrived today 12/31/19 which was too late for a Christmas gift.  The qualify feels poor and the fit is a bit small.
1.0,NO 2 ARE THE SAME SIZE.  THE SIZE DIFFERENCES ARE VERY NOTICEABLE.
1.0,"Had it less than 24 hours and it broke in half. It‚Äôs a piece of junk, thin cheap foil type and it turned my finger green in a few hours. It‚Äôs really bad. This is my first negative review, I always find something nice to say but this product is plain junk!"
1.0,"Everything about these pajamas is wrong.  They're about 2 sizes off.  And the fabric is cheap and uncomfortable.  In a nutshell, they are just horrible and I will be returning them."
1.0,Awful...fell apart in mail!
1.0,This purse was purchased for my mother for Mother‚Äôs Day. It arrived with no zipper pull. I have purchased a couple of Kenneth Cole purses off of Amazon before with no issue. The other purse in this order was for my MIL and the zipper on it broke after one day.
1.0,Cheap and ugly. The buttons don't taper like in the photo. They are straight down the middle. The collar is thin and has zero carstock in it to keep it from flapping around.<br /><br />Even one star is too high a rating for this atrociously ugly vest.
1.0,"Great space and lots of pockets. Unfortunately the inner, waterproof lining peeling off after only three days of use."
1.0,Had holes
1.0,Not even close to a 3X. More like a small teen. The fabric is ok and shipping was very fast. Quick refund and easy customer service.
1.0,I always thought the purpose of goggles is to see underwater with them on!  These goggles I bought recently are the worst seeing goggles. You‚Äôre better off using your own eyes underwater then using the aegend swimming goggles.
1.0,Today was only the 3rd time I used them and they already ripped.
1.0,It was not worth the money
1.0,"The quality of this product leaves much to be desired!! After just a week of use, the gold handle began unraveling and shredding. I had to cut it off. The golden chain turned an awful greenish color and left my hands smelling like tarnished metal. I replaced the chain with a red, white, and blue length of paracord which worked much better than the chain and was much prettier...But the blue color on the entire outside of the clutch also rubbed off! By the end of the second week of use, all of the outside edges were turned completely white, along with surfaces that are handled the most. I am extremely disappointed with the poor quality and workmanship, and I  would not recommend this product to anyone! This product is too expensive anyway, especially for such a shoddy accessory that can no longer be used!! Do not buy!!"
1.0,Cheaply made. My wife wanted because she is a server. For her pens wait book etc. Very cheaply made only things are good for is a child's craft class one use throw them away. I would not buy them again.
1.0,I wear the bracelet one time and the string they used to hold the beads together just popped when I was taking it off and it happened to both bracelets.
1.0,Ordered an XL for my husband who's 6ft tall and usually wears a size 34....they fit him like tight capri pants.
1.0,Not really one size too small and I am size 10
1.0,Bad marketing
1.0,Bags were cheap and the drawstrings were coming off the bags.  Bracelets were tarnished in color.
1.0,was soooo small....more like a hand towel
1.0,Very small.  Would be better for a child not an adult
1.0,This was too small in the chest area even though it is my size. Outside of the return period so it is sitting in a bag un-used. :(
1.0,Not at all like the pictures.  Its a photo copy pic on paper glued to a pendent. Why are yall even selling this garbage?
1.0,Prongs on the earrings were bent and the backs did not secure properly I am not satisfied with my purchase
1.0,The fit would have been great but it was patchy around the bust and then too long.
1.0,Junk!  Watch arrived broken.  Not worth sending back.  Would NOT recommend this product
1.0,returned it as it looked really cheap and was broken to boot.
1.0,"First time I opened the umbrella, one of the spokes broke from the threading on the end of the rod. Do not purchase."
1.0,"My son had been eye-balling this sweatshirt for awhile now so I was excited to order it for him. I was expecting an on-trend hoodie, but that is not what I got. It is very very thin fabric, and had a satiny feel/look to it. It would be ruined the first time an 11 year old wore it as it would be all snagged up. It is being returned."
1.0,"Dress was too heavy for the wife, there was no slit in the bottom as advertised. The return was a hassle. Company is no good."
1.0,Did not like the shiny fabric
1.0,They need an Obama smile for brown folks.
1.0,The band is super comfortable but the magnets literally came unglued in less than 3 weeks. Pretty bad considering I've only used this name for about a week total
1.0,"I bought these packing cubes because I already own a set of 3 from a different brand and I love them, they make packing so much easier.  I wanted this pack of 7 because they had a wider variety of sizes and I liked the color and I'm planning on doing a lot of travel this year.  I was so happy to use them on my spring break trip.  Unfortunately, on the first use it was clear that these are a poor quality product and not as sturdy as my other packing cubes.  First, they feel and look flimsy, that should be your warning sign.  While packing them to go on my trip the zippers on two of the cubes pulled apart.  I though, ok, it's not that big of a deal since I managed to fix one and luckily the other cube had 2 zippers, so I resigned myself to only using 1 of them and moving the broken part as far to the end as possible.  However, on my return trip, I packed them and all was fine, but by the time I got home and unpacked my suitcase the large cube had completely torn apart at the seems from various different sides of the cube.  It is completely unusable.  These are flimsy and don't hold up.  And I didn't even over-fill it.  There was plenty of room for more shirts but it still fell apart.  Meanwhile, my original packing cubes are still going strong.  Looks like I'll be buying a new set soon from a different company."
1.0,"Not recommended. Quality was poor. Clasp was off center. Edging around flap was sloppily seamed. Cheap product, not worth the price."
1.0,My wife ended up returning this item the locked is broken.
1.0,"Material was cheap, not worth price. Looks like costume made with thin fabric."
1.0,This mask was too small and too tight. Doesn‚Äôt provide the space needed for choral singing.
1.0,It is not as pictured<br />Runs small and very very short<br />Waste of money
1.0,I bought these leggins at Burkes and loved them. I bought them on here and they are huge!!!!!
1.0,"One of the lens came off and I couldn't find it.  So, it is kind of waste."
1.0,Total crap!!!! One pair doesn‚Äôt have the correct shape to even be worn as an ear cuff  earring and the other pair snapped instantly! The only pair that I liked are actually blue instead of white/clear stones. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this garbage
1.0,I expected the  resin epoxy dome to be a nice hard surface that rose above the bottle cap trim as it looks like it does in the picture. Instead it was just a puffy sticker that apparently was glued but fell out when it arrived.
1.0,I love the feel and look of them but they‚Äôre not practical. They roll the moment I start pedaling.
1.0,Received item very fast. Unfortunately it was cracked.
1.0,Missing buttons and Very. Very Poor construction! However the colors are pretty and it will be repaired.  I only paid  $16.00 so what I paid for...I got.
1.0,It broke when i wore it only 1 time.
1.0,I revceived the dress with a stain. I want to return it and change it for a different one.
1.0,I read I should avoid these caps but I tried anyway. Don‚Äôt bother. Sizes fit no one. The shape doesn‚Äôt even make sense. Avoid.
1.0,The material shrink after a wash. Not a good quality at all. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,These leg warmers are for children or people with legs the size of most adults‚Äô arms.
1.0,This ring is pretty & all but it really disappointed me. It's definitely not sterling silver. It left a blue mark on my toe.
1.0,Washed it once and it turned my entire load of laundry PINK!  Ruined a brand new shirt.  Buyers BEWARE.
1.0,"Pretty bathing suit,not made for someone that's bigger than a B cup"
1.0,Sticky mess in the drier! Damaged my leggings
1.0,Looked hideous on my size 12 body. Had to return it.
1.0,"I thought I was ordering a 95% cotton shirt.  Turns out, it is only 60% cotton.  The description is wrong, wrong."
1.0,Terrible material. Dress is see through
1.0,It was making my toes get blisters
1.0,So cute but XL is tiny & short. Perhaps they sent a mismarked size?  I am 5'2&#34; 120 lbs. no way this will fit me
1.0,"I have 15 year old upper cartilage ear piercings that have gradually become sensitive and I‚Äôm not sure why. Anyway, after realizing that I want to prevent them from closing, I‚Äôve been on the hunt for plastic ear retainers. These were the first ones I‚Äôve ordered but unfortunately, they still made the holes sensitive. I had to take them out after about 5 hours when I couldn‚Äôt take that tingling feeling anymore. Sadly, I‚Äôll have to return them."
1.0,"This top is so small I can't  even get it over my head. I DO NOT HAVE A PRINTER TO PRINT A RETURN LABEL.  Amazon tried to send me to the seller's ""return "" page but repeatedly failed.  This is a mismarked and unusable throw away..don't deal with this seller!"
1.0,"The material on this dress is rough and scratchy. It makes you SWEAT because it holds in body heat like a sauna. This is not a cotton blend or anything summer-friendly. The design in person looks pixelated and almost blurry. You can definitely tell the quality of this dress and where it came from. Sometimes things on here are a great bargain, but in this case you get what you paid for. There is so stretch to this dress and it is a straight line dress. There will be no flattering shape to this if you have any type of bust, waist, hips or booty. This dress works best for a straight line silhouette. Like I said, no stretch, unflattering shape, and cheap hot scratchy plastic-like material. My skin was itching non stop wearing this. It had a terrible smell. Not to mention the seller sent me the wrong dress and refused to accept it back. The seller said this is what you get when you order the ‚Äúblue‚Äù dress. Just so you ladies are aware, they will send you any pattern they have in stock. So I tried to make the best of it and tried it on.  Wow. I was dripping sweat and itching before I even left the house. I gave this away to a coworker for free!"
1.0,Can't wear it much too small. Not worth the price to return. But it's really cute so if you order 2 or 3 sizes larger I think it's cute
1.0,Shirt is huge and is solid light grey. Color is not ombre as pictures. Will be returning.
1.0,too too small for an xx large
1.0,"Well, I've put it off as long as I can. I really hate leaving really bad reviews. You kind of get the impression you're buying an item that is hand made, not mass produced in China. It comes sort of attached to a card that says made in China on it. The quality is appalling. It arrived broken. The rose on the ring had come off. I don;t know where they get their measurements for a wrist, but it's clearly not from a human adult. The part that goes on your wrist couldn't possibly be expected to fit an average persons wrist. What you can't see in the picture is the extender chain. Yes, a lot of bracelets have them. But, usually you don't really need them. Maybe an extremely anorexic person could wear this without using the extender.  The glue used to hold the rose and other decorative parts is obviously very cheap if it can't even last long enough to make it to the buyer. The entire item is so poorly made and obviously slapped together on an assembly line. Not handmade. The chains are not metal, as they appear in the photo. Most of it is cheap plastic and the clasp is uneven. To be honest I have purchased much nicer items at The Dollar Store. I showed it to my neighbor and she said she could make a better one. Looking at some other reviews I see this is a problem for others as well.<br /><br />I did contact the seller. They responded promptly and offered to send me another one and even provided a link to the item. However, it was not for the in the picture. It was for a white one with a completely different design. This says to me the seller may not have even taken the time to look up my order and see which one I had purchased. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,Does not come with everything it list!
1.0,Too small and turned rusty. I‚Äôve only had them for a few days and haven‚Äôt got any water on them. Disappointed
1.0,"After a week of use, the knobs of the watch fell off. So much for that..."
1.0,wayto small
1.0,Not even the brand I ordered.. And they were too small not like the ones I usually buy
1.0,La calidad no fue lo que esperaba y el tama√±o esta peque√±o compre un L y parece M
1.0,This does not have a built in bra as described
1.0,It's like a medium size. Would not recommend it
1.0,I could only use the shirt because everything else was too big. Visor is unusable as it‚Äôs way to big and shipped flat. Poor quality all around.
1.0,"While band still works, logo has faded in less than 6 months of normal daily use."
1.0,"Watch was good quality and loved the color/texture. However, the watch was not working straight out the box. The ''seconds'' hand had a chip or scratch on the tip of it; it looked like the product was already used or was a display item in a store."
1.0,Item is cheaply made and sleeves are too long. The inner sleeves have to be pulled back in after putting arms through. I wore it once and probably would not wear again.
1.0,I bought two air of petite short. One was to long the other to short. Very sad to have to change products
1.0,"The workmanship is very poor, and the thread will burst once you wear it"
1.0,"This mask is absolutely garbage I had to end up cutting holes in the mask to see. it was extremely difficult to breath and the mask was just one color , a white/grey."
1.0,These cufflinks came from a third world country with a twisted view of quality. Awful is a step up from what I revieved.
1.0,"I ordered 2 large,  2 small received 3 out of 4. They are not loose fitting, the small and large look the same size and they are not this grey color they are light grey and stiff with no pockets.  Had four my girlfriends and gave to them but wasn't happy.  Still haven't received mine I'll be surprised to see what I receive!"
1.0,"Product sucks. Thin, uncomfortable, not cut for men. Also arrived dry later. Do not buy!!!!!"
1.0,It was not like pictured. I bought this because I was going flying out of town and when I got it it looked like some life‚Äôs Halloween mask. Not a good fit because the openings on the sides were wide open. Just not safe.
1.0,"This product should be under the childrens section.  I usually wear a 2X to 3X but since it was a slim fit I got a 4X.  I could not even get one arm down the sleeve. I'm a tall guy, 6'4 245 lb but for a 4x to be so small I couldn't get both arms in the shirt come on.  Unfortunately I didn't wear it right away and now can't get a refund so just a warning don't trust the sizes on the item."
1.0,Not women size more of juniors.
1.0,It looks like a mumu without shoulders. It‚Äôs literally hideous.
1.0,I ordered the same order in the same pants from last time which was a size 32 waist. How did I get a 40 waist? They are completely useless to me Please contact me to know what to do that was a waste of $36 I need my money back or some new pants. I already opened them out of the plastic I did not put  Them on.
1.0,"This ran very small for a 2X.  They feel more like a pair of leggings that have been cut off.  And, tbe elastic in the waist band has rolled and feels twisted after 2 times of wearing them and they have not even been washed yet."
1.0,The print was so small it could not be read at all. Very dissapointing
1.0,Do not buy this product ...
1.0,Sizing not true to size
1.0,"Insanely heavy, I couldn't wear them for more than a few minutes. The blue is really dark so you can't see it in dark hair. Shipping took forever but less time than they said so I couldn't adequately anticipate where to ship (work or home). And too expensive to return. Pretty in the pictures on this website but don't waste your money. There's beautiful blue earrings all over this site. Spend your money elsewhere."
1.0,Not true to size. If you wear size 8-10 go for the large or extra large
1.0,Arrived Broken! Don't waist your time.
1.0,i returned it.<br />but will order the smaller size
1.0,Ordered an XL.  Can't possibly be any more than a medium.
1.0,Beautiful but two stones were missing necklace was a missing stones when arrivedüò©
1.0,"They shipped me the wrong size and style, but since they fit, I kept them.  I should have sent them back; bad quality.  After about a dozen times wearing them, the left heel fell off. They smell very bad too... a rancid smell. Wolverine told me they are not covered under the warranty since they were purchased from an unauthorized seller."
1.0,Rather not give this item any stars!!! Links constantly fall apart. Definitely not worth buying.
1.0,very cheap. broke right away
1.0,"I will never by another watch like the one I bought at amazon,It was a great price but for the money it wasent worth it."
1.0,"Looked nice at first but doesn't last long.  Poor quality!  I bought 4 of these as gifts and 3 of them broke the first time worn, the other one I don't know if it broke or not, the person I gave it to didn't tell me."
1.0,Because I purchase it for my daughter‚Äôs birthday gift but the picture it‚Äôs not same<br />it like that the real frok so that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt like it I‚Äôd give you the one to start it
1.0,"I received this item already bent, down hull from there. If it catches On your clothing at all the metal will bend. Terrible quality."
1.0,"This kimono is huge. The fabric is cheap, very hot, and drapes poorly, ballooning out around you. I wear a L to XL size and this top was enormous, certainly NOT the kimono pictured on the model. DON'T BUY - it is a total waste of money. (Unfortunately I opened this just before July 4, after the return period had closed. It will be donated)."
1.0,Way to small! Had to return.
1.0,I received a regular Teeshirt?<br />No vneck.No curve at the bottom?<br />ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëÄüòè
1.0,I personally did not like the feeling of this on my skin. It feels like paper. Hospital gowns are more comfortable. Had to return. Would not recommend.
1.0,WAY to tight and wouldn't stay up
1.0,I got this and it was much shorter than expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 130lbs so not real tall but when I bend over my butt definitely shows to the world
1.0,Received this order in Friday.  2 of the toe rings broke not even 24 hours after putting on
1.0,These masks are very thin and for most they either the nose wire comes out and pokes you or the string breaks.
1.0,I ordered these for my Mom; she had no idea how to use them and neither did I. I'm returning them
1.0,"Swimmers; Beware of false advertisement.<br />I bought a swimmo watch during the end of November 2020. It arrived early January 2021, the tracking service was not reassuring. Once I received the watch, I started trying on my swimming training. The first thing I noticed is that the first time the watch connect to the app, it takes a long time and even several tries. The app is not really nice for data analysis.<br />During the training, the watch is accurate for swimming styles but for swimming drills, it missed the mark. It does not detect laps (0% detection) on kick drills with board and it supposed to have a feature for kick&Drill. There are several drills the the accuracy is 50% at its best. Therefore, at the end of the training routine your data is off by 30% or more (depending on your training). I have sent several e-mails to their customer/technical center and their response is always respectful but not my expectation of a responsible company. On several e-mails they state that some of the drills are like changing swimming style in the middle of the lap and should be avoided (in other words, you should adapt your training to your watch and not the other way around). After 2 weeks, I contacted customer service for either refund or help. After 3 weeks of no results I asked for a refund and they denied the refund because of it has to be within 14 days of the purchase and it has to be a hardware issue (not a Firmware issue, that according to them is my problem).<br />My takeaways:<br />-Swimmo Watch only works for just swimming styles.<br />-it is not very comfortable<br />-You have to hit it very hard to use the options<br />-Connection issues with the smartphone<br />-It must be used in dominant hand for better results<br />-Customer service is polite but you'll never reach results<br />-Inaccuracy makes the product useless<br />-Refund is hardly an option<br /><br />My advice: STAY AWAY from Swimmo"
1.0,Broke after the first use. Still using it with tape around the clasp.
1.0,My daughter loves these but after just a few wears they have completely broken
1.0,"The package was super ugly. They wrapped it like trash. Is my first time giving a negative review like this but I have to be honest;  buying this is a waist of money...its  very small, none like other crowns  from  different sellers i got this same crown for my princes when she turned 1 and it was really  nice well packaged and It was  looking authentic and far  bigger .This one looks like as if they use a regular paper and painted it. Total trash, I would  have give it a negative star instead one."
1.0,The belt loop is actually already lost because it's not actually attached to the belt and reverse side is plain and ugly.
1.0,"I liked the hat till I wore it in the sun , stains appear around head band and on top of hat where it touches the head due to sweat. Tried to wash but hat is permanently stained , if you wear this hat , stay out of the sun."
1.0,I understand I only paid a few dollars for it so I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be an amazing quality. But when I opened the package it was broken. All the charms fall off constantly and are very cheap material. I DONT recommend.
1.0,Bag was nothing like what is pictured!!
1.0,Too small.  Its not a 3x.
1.0,These pajamas were soooooooo cheaply made. The fabric is of the lowest quality and the material is translucent. I'm extremely disappointed.
1.0,I only received one sweatshirt while they said both were feliveref
1.0,"Liked material. Disliked buttons,for a men's sweater were on the left."
1.0,"These boots would not last fifteen minutes in a Nebraska winter. Very thin, not the quality I was expecting from Sorel."
1.0,I bought this set in a xl it fit me like a small very disappointing I was really lookin forward to wearing it
1.0,Does not look near as cute as the picture
1.0,After only the 3rd wash on medium hot the design completely came off!!
1.0,The bracelet fell off!
1.0,Worst Make. Half inch scratch on left glass. Cheap look
1.0,I loved this bracelet but it didn't last long at all! The chain broke from one side of the eye after literally ONE day of wearing it!
1.0,cheap and dumb looking. dont waste the 2 bucks or whatever this thing costs.
1.0,the video i saw on these shoes - is soft and you can bend and almost roll them up.<br />the shoes i rec'd have a little give but not that soft at all.<br />they look like the pillow slides but i dont think thats what i got. i will return and try another.
1.0,Broke the same day purchased.
1.0,The clothing arrived not fully sewed.
1.0,"This shirt was the strangest fitting shirt I could have possibly purchase. I actually purchased it a couple years ago but I was going back through my history looking for a different shirt that I wanted to reorder and I ran across this one. It was such a strange fitting shirt I felt compelled to leave a review. It was very frumpy and the little pieces of material on the chest were too large and draped off of me in the weirdest, sloppiest way. It was like somebody took my Grandma's old shirt and try to make it trendy."
1.0,1. Real color looks baby blue<br />2. Got a medium fits like and extra large<br />3. Very unhappy with this purchase
1.0,I was expecting a longer tank top. Silky material that I did not want
1.0,This shirt is comfortable but is very small.
1.0,Item has clearly been worn and returned before. Deodorant stains all over it. Not new. Also color is more black and not a true navy as expected. Very disappointed. Looked like a cute dress but obviously is used. Returning.
1.0,Horrible dress cheap material very ugly I bought it based on good reviews but I returned I do not recommend
1.0,"This dress was hideous, it looked nothing like the photo.  I have been battling with this seller for well over a month for a refund and at this time have not received it.  Amazon has also not been helping with this seller.  It states ""free refund"" when purchasing but that is not the case.  Stay away from this company, Yangzij"
1.0,Dress was ill  fitting
1.0,Mine just came WITH NO NOSE PADS! WTF?
1.0,I ordered a large and received a Chinese size large which would have fit my size 4 daughter.  Dress is pretty and would be perfect for date night or a night out with friends.
1.0,way too small and i got an xlarge
1.0,"Really poor product. They immediately started causing my earlobes to itch, so I'm returning them. I had the plastic in my ears for seconds, and my lobes still itch 30 minutes later."
1.0,Too small in the shoulder and front coverage. It also had a very small whole in the fabric in the front!
1.0,These are the biggest pieces of junk I have ever purchased.  My wife tried to warn me about the low price.  They came broken!  Never again will I try to save money on cufflinks
1.0,"First of all, the main reason why I'm giving this watch 1 star, is for the simple fact that it's not being accurately described. This watch is beautiful looking and I won't talk about the movement and or mechanism, others have covered that already. The main issue with this watch is that it's not made from steel, in fact the only steel this watch has is the Case backing. The part that touches your skin. Other than that, the Bracelet and watch case it self are made entirely of BRASS, chrome painted BRASS. Why do you think you the watch is less than $40? If you don't mind a watch that will turn copper color in a couple months, then buy it. I would have gladly paid $90 it was really made of Stainless Steel but it's not."
1.0,This dress was dirty and it was missing sequences. Eww.
1.0,Had a big crimp in the cup. Washed it and still couldn't wear it.
1.0,We're too small how can I return this item
1.0,I had to return them. They were too small. I didn‚Äôt read close enough. I thought they were one size!
1.0,"Apparently the previous reviewers understand mechanical items better than I do. The 4 panel miniature manual is worthless. I have 30 minutes into this. It took about 10 to figure out how to open the ""groove door"". It was easy to size & cut; though the manual is a bit confusing as to which side to cut, common sense tells me that the thin front part needs to be left alone. I have spent 20 more minutes unsuccessfully trying to put it back together.  If Go-Tan would like to contact me through Amazon & provide customer service as to how to use the belt, I will revise the review. For now, I can't use the belt at all."
1.0,"Do you want a pale neon orange sweatshirt. I don‚Äôt. The color is awful.<br />I offered it to a female friend of mine. She laughed and said, ‚ÄòNo Thanks!‚Äô<br />I am very disappointed."
1.0,Way to small. Don‚Äôt buy
1.0,Bracelets are pretty but very disappointed bc of the sizing. I bought these for my 11 yr old daughter and most of them were too loose when the string was fully tied. Same for myself as an adult trying to wear them :(
1.0,Silver plating came off . Was not sober at all
1.0,"Overall I liked the style and length of the dress, and the pockets are really handy. It is unlined and the fabric is stiff (has a hint of 90's gym 'swoosh' pants). It definitely runs small. I normally wear an 8/10 in dresses (medium usually), but I sized up to a large in this. I am petite in the rib cage but endowed in the chest, it fit snug around my chest and ribs, even the elastic around my waist was snugger than I prefer and my waist measures 26.5 inches. It definitely did not feel like a large.<br /><br />The dress I received had 2 defects. The one shoulder strap was set farther inward in the front than the other. It was quite obvious to look at and also caused the outside edge of the top to rumple. The buttons were also not sewn of straight. I would not recommend this dress and am planning on returning it.<br /><br />I decided to return the dress due to the defects"
1.0,"Nothing like the picture. So disappointed, I wanted for an activity."
1.0,"not at all a slouchy beanie.  So far I have not been credited with my return, I paid more for the shipping for each hat than I did for the actual hat! And I returned them all...  no bueno."
1.0,If I could give 0 stars I would. These are complete trash. It is like someone superglue the ball to the ring and most of them arrived bent all to hell. Definate waste of money.
1.0,The description says Woman's XXL (should fit up to size 14)  I cant even put it on. It is more like a Woman's 6-8 I am a busty size 14-16 woman's tops and this might be a Teen xLarge. So disappointed.
1.0,Cute but way too stiff to be comfortable
1.0,Not worth $30+
1.0,It fits very weird wasn‚Äôt for my body type
1.0,The dress I got looks nothing like this.
1.0,way too small and crappy fabric - good will donation
1.0,"used for like 3 months, pink came off in a few pots..started showing the black through just about everywhere. This is after hand washing and hanging dry."
1.0,"Maybe for a crappy Halloween costume, not attractive at all."
1.0,Do not order...very thin material....rips very easy and runs very small
1.0,"This jacket looks NOTHING like the photo.<br /><br />First off, this is a JACKET, NOT a COAT -- I live in Texas and this thing is nowhere close to warm enough to be called a coat. Hoodies are warmer than this.<br /><br />The photo shows a herringbone type wool with a heather type grey color. The actual jacket  is more of a cheap fleece fabric and a solid bluish-grey color. The fabric looks very cheap, and seems like the type that will pill and look horrible after a couple of wears.<br /><br />The photo also shows a soft, plush, sheepskin type lining inside the hood. The actual jacket hood lining is closer to flannel, or a very thin fleece.<br /><br />About the only thing represented well in the photo is the toggle closures, which are cheaply sewn on, attached at a piece of cheap black vinyl with crooked stitches.<br /><br />Ladies, if you are shopping for clothes online, invest in Amazon Prime! I am sending this back for free and getting a full refund because of my Prime membership - it's worth every penny"
1.0,"I generally wear an eight, but this was so small you think it was  intended to be a tight dress or something....  not a swim cover up in the least. Bummer because it‚Äôs cute, it might fit my nine-year-old niece, but not a grown woman."
1.0,When this item received to my house it was missing the little silver piece that's for the extension for the lock.
1.0,Not a fan of the hat. Meant for people with large square peanutheads and doesn't fit my normal personhead shape.
1.0,Ordered a 2x and it fit my son's gf who wears between a medium and large
1.0,The flag is upside down. I like it but it needs to be right side up.
1.0,"My husband purchased this bracelet for me on April the 15th of this year and it fell apart,what can be done about this?"
1.0,"Please STOP selling this incorrectly sized Product as a size 3X, when it is obviously no more than a Size Small. I have bought the same Cardigans from Amazon by a few other Designers and they Fit Perfectly, the Isaac Liev Cardigans are inaccurately Sized advertised"
1.0,"The llama isn‚Äôt as nice as the similar  K Adler llama but it is okay, just a bit cruder and rougher overall. It did arrive with a broken neck and two broken legs, requiring gluing and internal splinting so that it could stand up again and not have its head fall to one side. With a Peruvian wife and Christmas closing in, I opted to fix it but its quality abd condition was truly disappointing. I don‚Äôt know if it was used or just abused; it simpky was in sad shape when it arrived."
1.0,Sliders damaged
1.0,good for summer outfit
1.0,"I typically wear a size small tshirt but I ordered a size medium and it's WAY too small. It's closer to a child's medium than a woman's, I had to double check to make sure I didn't order a child's size by accident. Not worth the money and took forever to ship/deliver."
1.0,Pants way to big and top to tight cheap material
1.0,I can‚Äôt believe I received the same dress that is pictured and with a hole! The material is if the dollars store sold material to make dresses. This dress is one ugly dress and definitely not worth over $30 bucks. It is getting harder and harder to buy clothes on Amazon that are good quality.
1.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 I got a small and it was still too big and too short
1.0,"Cannot be a nose ring, too tiny"
1.0,The whole front of this suitcase was smashed in. I wouldn't even give this one star.
1.0,Calidad no buema
1.0,Not good material.  Super sheer.  Seems not well completed.
1.0,"Returned immediately. This dress felt like it was made out of paper ‚Äì the materials used were very poor quality. There was not even a label on it with washing instructions or materials or anything like that. On top of that, the ‚Äúbelt‚Äù that it came with literally fell apart as it was removed from its packaging. The color did not even match what I was expecting. The picture showed it as red, but in real life, it was more of a coral. Do not buy this dress. It is not good for anything."
1.0,"Nice looking but keeps terrible time. Runs fast, several minutes per day. Winding stem fell out of the watch after two months. You get what you pay for. Junk"
1.0,There is an odor even after it was aired out
1.0,"The fabric was cheap and the seams crooked. The cutouts extend farther in the front the expected,"
1.0,"The sweatpants fit well, but are made of a very light material, not really sweatpants. Seams were fraying and cheaply stitched."
1.0,it broke as soon as i got it. so i couldnt even wear it one..
1.0,"I loved this sweater when I first received it as it was lightweight and I could wear it and not get so hot. The third time I wore it, I noticed it had started to pill all over the sweater. If that wasn't bad enough, I had a large hole under my arm that I didn't even notice until the end of the day.  So this is a poor quality sweater IMO. The return window has passed so I won't even be able to return it."
1.0,Ordered the 2 pair and only received one. No red bag to keep them from getting scratched. They were thrown in the box in an open plastic baggie and were scratched from being in a box with a bunch of heavy stuff.  Not happy.
1.0,Would give this item one star but won't let me.. got this outfit for my granddaughter for school.. she wore it once and pants split where it's not fixable.. the whole crotch area is ripped like material was dry rotted.. awful!
1.0,The product was marketed towards me as a replacement band for my 1st gen galaxy smart watch and not only were the pins not long enough to install properly but after replacing them with the proper size they still constantly fall off
1.0,Small and tangled.
1.0,"I love a dress with pockets, but this dress isn't cut correctly for them.  I have a fairly straight figure, a bit of a belly, but no hips to speak of.  This dress makes me look incredibly full hipped because the pockets add so much volume.  Also, the cutouts around the neck end up showing parts of my bra unless positioned just so. Wish I hadn't thrown out the packaging so I could return."
1.0,super ugly. nothing like the picture super upset
1.0,"I did not like this dress, The neckline is not scoop neck but Very high on the neck. Its also totally see through"
1.0,"These shirts are advertised ""Made in USA"". The plastic bags they come in are labeled as such, but the garments have no label at all. No material care instruction label and no marking indicating where they are made. Made in America is why I bought these particular shirts. The ad says it like the seller is proud of it, the bag label says it, but mysteriously the garment is not marked at all.<br /><br />In today's world, there are FTC  policies that establish what it takes to mark items as ""Made in USA"". Company's trademark product images and names like Jeep. I thought it was odd when I didn't see a trademark registration anywhere when the Jeep image was displayed, but thought maybe it doesn't have to have one since the word Jeep isn't used?<br /><br />Then I started looking for the standard manufacturer material make-up and country of orgin label. Nothing. Seems to me that IF these shirts are really made in America, there would be a label of marking stating that fact, clearly displayed on the actual garment.<br /><br />Seems like these are more likely Chinese made to me. Buyer beware, Not a big deal if they are, except that they are advertised as Made in the USA."
1.0,This product it not worth the money time or effort. I brought it thinking it was going to fit me but I was wrong.
1.0,Arrived and it was already broken.
1.0,"This top looks nothing like the photos. It is very thin, very cheap looking. Returned."
1.0,This was not a Banana Repulbic shirt as advertised. It didn‚Äôt have a logo at all and was a brand I‚Äôve never heard of. I returned it.
1.0,the stupid pads don't stay in place in the bra when working out or in the wash. They are not stitched in place so they drift everywhere. The fabric doesn't wick sweat away.  Not recommended AT ALL for larger girls.
1.0,poor quality product
1.0,It fell apart before I even got a chance to wash it. Don't waste your money!
1.0,"Too big (long, vertically) for what I was looking for."
1.0,Dress was cheap. Tried to return and Amazon wouldn‚Äôt let me even though I have returned meilun items previously
1.0,"Received a returned, broken pair.. Nothing I can really say."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6ecef6e7b4cf3df59926c428c8a7b87b]]
1.0,"Nice belt, but it‚Äôs brown ü§Ø"
1.0,"I liked the idea, but these don't do what I had hoped. I need reading glasses, and I get tired of wearing them on my head when I'm not reading. The very top portion of the lens is fine, but the middle portion is too powerful and makes it impossible to wear when walking around or driving, since it makes everything blurry. The bottom portion for reading is such a small area, that it's hard to read anything. You literally have to turn your head slightly from side to side to find that miniscule spot that is magnified for reading. I guess I'm going back to glasses on the top of my head!"
1.0,No breast support. Not a good choice if you have large breast. Every where else fit.
1.0,I received solid pink dress. Picture shows two colors. Also size runs larger
1.0,Way to small for us Americans. Sending it back.
1.0,The lanyard is superrrrrrrrr smalllllll omg.
1.0,This shirt is awful. The material is a slick type of material and extremely thin. Nothing like the pictures shown.
1.0,"Photos shows birds facing opposite directions, but face same direction in reality."
1.0,Does not look like the picture. Very cheaply made. Bottoms when stretched the print looked distorted.
1.0,After hours of searching for just the right glasses I was so disappointed that I received a pair of sun glasses in the mail that looked nothing like the ones in the picture or the description. The ones they sent me are honestly the ugliest pair I've ever seen and so strange. Purchase elsewhere to avoid hideous glasses.
1.0,"This is very soft, but NO support what so ever! The cups have padding that bunch up when putting them on. The shoulder straps fall off shoulder since not enough elastic in it. I do not recommend these unless you are a very small person"
1.0,They where not the size and color as in pic
1.0,Has a horrible smell to it!!!!! I've tried soaking it in laundry detergent and hand washing it and the smell is still lingering!!! It's a good looking necklace but I'm afraid to give it to my son due to the pungent smell!!!!
1.0,"Horrible, did not fit correctly. The band was huge and the hat part did not fit my head. The module that turns on the headset was detached from the modual buttons. Very unhappy."
1.0,"Item doesn‚Äôt work.<br />Batteries are on, battery pack lights up but mask lights won‚Äôt turn on.<br />No happy since this was tonight‚Äôs costume!"
1.0,Poor quality high price
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c40b75737027303ca3ab262a9126c205]] One earring was broken. They don‚Äôt look quite like they‚Äôre supposed to either.
1.0,This item just about fit me when I got it. I washed it on gentle in cold water. It no longer fits at all. Wasted money. One star because the color is beautiful.
1.0,"Very disappointed, waited for this shirt when it arrived it was to small I mean too too small . Will not purchase again."
1.0,Quality of fabric poor.  Fabric is sheer. Pockets visible through the material.
1.0,I had to give it away it was supposed to be an sx but it was huge
1.0,The worst company to deal with!!!!!  I was never unhappy with Amazon as with this  third party. Jacket quality was wonderful but try to return it if you need to
1.0,‚ÄúJ‚Äù Pendant fell off the first time worn . So sad cuz i loved the chain
1.0,"As many had mentioned the seam before / above your toes pills and rips into a hole.<br />Had mine for 6 months before I noticed a pair with a hole.  Looked at the other pairs and yes the seam pills into a ball before it forms a hole.  Looks like material disintegrated instead of ripped.<br />I have a lot of socks so much so that these are barely broken in and cushiony still.<br />I am extremely disappointed with how quickly holes form.  Even cheap Hanes socks last longer.<br />Also, seems to have a lot of synthetic materials.  Enough to make your feet smell."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:14c0c2ce05625f8e18ac14b4e82246e5]] Out of the box looked like plastic, I would never normally set something on fire, nor should anyone try this, but I burned it to see if it would act like leather or pu leather.  Real leather is naturally flame retardant.  This caught on fire and burned up.  Looked cheap, and failed the leather test."
1.0,No me gust√≥ este producto para nada!! No pierdas tu dinero la tela es p√©sima se transparenta TODO!! lo trate de utilizar con ropa interior sin costuras y a√∫n asi se ve√≠a literalmente todo que l√°stima lo espere por bastante tiempo ir√° directo a la basura. üëé
1.0,Wand looked black in the picture.  Actual wand is greenish dark brown.  Disappointed.
1.0,"This is very poorly made. The material is thin and see through, no tag with care instructions and all of the sewing is very poorly done. Threads everywhere. The side pleats are not even on each side."
1.0,Either I got the wrong product or they look nothing like the picture. Either way I am sending them back.
1.0,"I purchase this band for a  Rolex sea dweller men‚Äôs watch, due to the information in the add stating men‚Äôs and woman‚Äôs strap. Well if you have any size to your wrist at all it just will not work, looks  way to so small."
1.0,"Weird shirt. It's wide, but short. Too bad it's too late to return."
1.0,"I got this watch band on Monday and put it on my Moto 360 on Tuesday. The quality seemed decent, but you could tell it was pretty inexpensive. Granted, I am comparing that to my other $100 - $500 watches. The edges are pretty sharp and the clasp was a little sticky, but figured that was due to being new... However, on Wednesday (the first full day on my wrist), I got home and &#34;attempted&#34; to remove my watch. To my surprise, I couldn't get it off. And when I say couldn't, I mean couldn't. Something was preventing the band clasp from opening no matter what I tried. I even had my wife try it since she could use both hands. Ultimately, I had to pry it open with a screwdriver which bend the locking assembly pretty bad.<br /><br />So, do I like the band? Yes, it looked nice for a $15 band. Would I recommend it? Not unless you have good health insurance because you may need to use it."
1.0,This did not come with a mask even though it says it‚Äôs included
1.0,"I was wearing this watch as I emptied my pool skimmer basket.  Fogged up immediately afterwards.  Don't waste your time.  Also back of watch is glass so if you try to remove it to de fog your watch, your screwed.<br />Keep looking"
1.0,Product arrived with zero felt pads.
1.0,"This is nothing like the photo, this is a long sleeve T-shirt out of the boy section of Walmart. The sleeves are too short, the neck is so tight, it is not the same material as pictured, it is not slouchy, this is worth $12."
1.0,Bought these because I thought they‚Äôd make great little key chains. I placed one on my key ring and within 48 hours I was picking it up off the ground after pulling my keys out of my pocket. Then it happened two or three more times. I ended up taking the thing off and just hanging it on the wall in my office because undoubtedly it would have fallen off and been lost forever if I didn‚Äôt. Would not recommend
1.0,came broken and bent  had to throw out
1.0,I never even got to wear it . It broke right as I pulled it out of the package. It was cheaply made
1.0,"It looks better in the picture,"
1.0,This dress is made for someone with a small chest & a petite body. Not happy with the purchase.
1.0,I bought the pin because I‚Äôm running a campaign and it helps with looking more serious. At first the pin remained flushed with my suit jackets - not sticking out or being bulgy. But then it loosened over the course of like two weeks and stuck out and constantly ended upside down. I didn‚Äôt like that.<br />After that it ended up just coming  a loose and falling off. If I weren‚Äôt constantly looking at the ground around campus I‚Äôd have lost it by now.
1.0,I was so excited when I ordered this product. When I received it I took it right out of the package and started loosening it so I can for it to my body. I noticed that it felt and looked very cheaply made. It looked like it belonged more for a costume than that everyday shapewhere. I was skeptical also because of the price. It was so cheap and I almost didn't buy it because of the price. Sometimes its better to buy the expensive ones. I will not recoment this to anyone and I will never buy from this brand ever again. I'm very dissapointed.
1.0,"Of course the product sounded too good to be true, at least for my use.  I had hoped these glasses would help with the halo effect on lights that I have driving at night.  The only thing they did was cast a yellow hue on everything."
1.0,Terrible quality...do not purchase!
1.0,The quality is great. Colors are vibrant. I will definitely be a returning customer. For more cute pieces.  All the best
1.0,"The glasses are very flimsy and it's hard to bend ear piece to fit your ear. One pair came with the nose guard missing. I tried to send them back, but I had trouble doing that. Very unhappy with the purchase, don't waste your money."
1.0,"I can‚Äôt even get the clasp open to wear it. It‚Äôs pretty, but not wearable, if I can‚Äôt get the clasp open to put it on."
1.0,"I ordered 4 of the same shirt (or so I thought), in 4 different sizes.  When they came, 2 of them were peach colored, and 2 were dark rose colored.  The medium fit bigger than the XL, and the L.  These totally aren‚Äôt the shirt that they show in the picture.  Not even close to the color."
1.0,I received the completely wrong item from what was pictured and what I purchased. Wrong style and size. I guess you get what you pay for!
1.0,Tiny and doesn't stretch and the clasp was broken.
1.0,The sizing on this garment is waaaaay off.  Disappointing.
1.0,No GOOD!!!!!THEY HURT!!!
1.0,Pants fit nicely especially on the hips and thigh area. Unfortunately the quality is so cheap and thin. Does t even feel like cords.
1.0,"It broke twice on me and I was lucky to find it both times.  I understand it isn't made out of strong material, but it really was disappointing that it broke and now for me to wear it again I have to find away to fix it.  It was really pretty and it didn't turn my ankle green I just wish it would have held together better."
1.0,Cheaply made. Didn't work on arrival. The ears are made of felt.
1.0,"Product not as described. I ordered a 2-tone gray and black bra, but a solid gray bra arrived. Branding is also different - shown as a Babylea brand online, but Ekouaer brand was delivered."
1.0,It breaks easily. I wore once and it broke in less than 1 hour!!!
1.0,"Nice material, but we received yesterday and she wore it to bed and this morning and there‚Äôs already a rip (picture attached) do not recommend because of this"
1.0,"My fault I guess, I SHOULD OF READ THE REVIEWS FIRST. THIS WAY I WOULD NOT OF GOTTEN STUCK. 1) REAL THIN CAME APART THE FIRST NIGHT. 2) SAID 3 PIECES ONLY GOT ONE PIECE. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE BLOCKED FROM USING AMAZON."
1.0,Having to buy another different pair of shoes  within the month they are tore up !?!
1.0,Cute but the 2 pins in the back of the pig will not unlock from the enamel pin.
1.0,"Good quality - runs extremely small. Bought in three colors for my husband. I'm hoping to simply exchange for a larger size, but haven't been able to find a way to do so."
1.0,"Too large, didnt like the material, i thought it would give a jears material looks, none of that. It's not flattering at all. I dislike it."
1.0,"This watch does NOT automatically set itself. Even worse, after you figure out how to set it to the right time, it still somehow changes to the wrong time. The buttons are tiny and a visually impaired person cannot reset it. Terrible product."
1.0,It‚Äôs pictured as grey and pink but bright blue and pink arrived
1.0,"The seller advertises that these earrings are sterling silver. That's not true. They are not marked with a stamp as all real silver and gold are required to be. When I contacted the seller about this, they claimed the manufacturer ""forgot"" to stamp them (a federal violation if it were actually true). The black dots on the earrings also flaked off all over the place and the hook that goes in your ear is very bendable and got warped just wearing them for 9 hours sitting at a desk."
1.0,"This is a cheaply made HUGE dress! It was a light knit sweater dress.... forget it ..it looks like t shirt material and everyone said length is fine.. it drags on the floor.  There is nothing here that i like.  Save your money. I am hoping it is so cheap that it will shrink......,,"
1.0,First time wearing them do not buy them junk
1.0,"I pulled the rose gold earrings out of the package to wear them for the first time tonight, and two hours later, at least eight of the little stones are missing. I‚Äôm really not happy."
1.0,"Had to return, this coat ran way too small"
1.0,I did return sent back the dresses  already because  bad quailty and didnt get my refund
1.0,"You get what you paid for.<br />Cheap plastic,<br />cool looking glasses.<br />If you're a person can't stop losing your shades, these are alright for you."
1.0,Poorly made strap. Both keepers broke on day one. Have to use a rubber band now to keep the long end in place until I find a better strap.
1.0,"Beware, I got these for my 6 year old... if your kids have sensitive skin, they shouldn‚Äôt use these... not good for prolonged use..."
1.0,Was soooooo ugly looked nothing like the picture
1.0,Extremely small for xxl. Very thin
1.0,I thought having Prime would take care of last minute items like this but it arrived broken. I changed the batteries in hopes that was the problem but no luck. Disappointing but at least I knew to have a back up plan just in case.
1.0,very small through the shoulders and chest
1.0,Order larger than you normally would for a belt. I'm a 32 waist so i've always purchased my belts 34. I ordered this belt size 34-36 and i could not even use the first hole in the belt.
1.0,"Returned the following day, the watch did not work. After setting it, it would only take a few minutes for the watch to stop working altogether. Very cheaply made."
1.0,Only had them for a week because one just fell off at that time and the metal post bent on the other prior to that
1.0,This fabric might as well be used for car repairs
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:c502775c8be092509a1ffa23f2accb51]] It looks nothing like the picture. It's not even the same shape. It's so far from the picture it's laughable. It's like someone saw the photo and said, ""I can make that"" then blindfolded themselves and tied their hands behind their back and tried to make it from memory with supplies found around the house."
1.0,"Works poorly, no instrucion"
1.0,Need to send back
1.0,"Didn‚Äôt look anything like the picture. It‚Äôs very tiny, dark, muted grey, and you can‚Äôt even make out that it‚Äôs an elephant. I‚Äôll be ordering a different one elsewhere."
1.0,Got this for my son for Christmas and it wore it about 2 weeks and the thing has already broken.  It broke at the little aluminum wire were the paracord ties in.  Not worth the money.
1.0,"I normally wear a small or medium but ordered this in a large because I wanted a big comfy sweatshirt to wear to a casual Christmas party. I was so disappointed when this arrived. Fit more like a small but even worse, it wasn‚Äôt a sweatshirt. It is a very cheap thin polyester material. And the Santa/wineglass design is weirdly placed halfway down the front of the shirt. Tried to return but the seller has not responded to my request."
1.0,"First of all the size of this shirt was a joke. I ordered a XXL thinking even if it runs a bit small it should be fine. WRONG. The XXL would barely fit a middle school child.<br /><br />The hems inside the shirt were unfinished, so if it had fit by some miracle, the first time washing it it would have done poorly.<br /><br />The actual shirt vs. the photo are similar, yet incredibly different. The most accurate thing about the listing vs. the actual shirt is the color. The shirt looks more like a youth league sports jersey instead of a blouse with flowing bell sleeves."
1.0,"Mask is very cute, but package was open and string broken on one side.  Obviously not inspected before shipment.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"It was just very unflattering, between the cut and the material not great<br /><br />I ordered an xxl and it fit like a large"
1.0,"Don‚Äôt waste time or money.  Received, put on and it broke.  Requested return and they sent a label but I have to pay return shipping for a broke item."
1.0,not up to zattacas standards
1.0,Ordered a necklace but received a bracelet but still paid higher price.
1.0,I ordered 8 and only got 7
1.0,"The costume came packed up tight in a bag which is fine, but the hat was separate and was packed with the costume bag tightly in to one of those Amazon shipping bags. It was absolutely crumpled up. There's no bringing this hat back to life. Amazon did a terrible job packing this and my son is pretty disappointed.<br /><br />I bought a toddler size and the gloves that came with are sized for a small to medium adult man or would fit most women. Not sized for a toddler.<br /><br />The hat was an adult sized hat.<br /><br />The shirt part looked good and fit pretty well, a little big but still reasonable."
1.0,Comes unlatched when I bend my wrist or when a jacket pushes against the latch.
1.0,Cheap construction--I'm sending it back.....
1.0,"This dress fits like a t-shirt.  I threw it in the wash after wearing it for the first time and all the little straps at the top snapped apart.  Right in the middle, I can‚Äôt sew it back together."
1.0,The balls are too small and very hard to get in as cartlidge piercings.
1.0,Do not buy this leggings as the quality comes very cheap and have holes upon receiving.
1.0,No room in the bust area!  Really pretty dress and I liked the material but the size does not compensate for women that have a bigger chest.
1.0,I was very disappointed with this bag! The side pocket ripped from the rest of the bag after a few uses.  The pocket was not overstuffed with items either.
1.0,You get what you pay for. Should have went with Dr. Marten's from the get go.<br /><br />Says leather in the title description.  Only to mislead and actually says it's fake in the other section description.
1.0,I want my money refunded and don‚Äôt waNt the hassle of returnIng it.  It‚Äôs CLEARLY DEFECTIVE I SHOULD NOT BE INCONVENIENCED FURTHER
1.0,Children sizes
1.0,THE WATCH IS GOOD LOKING BUT THE BAND DIDN'T LAST 4 MONTHS
1.0,"I ordered these because I see her stuff, on HSN.  And I fluctuate sizes and though what the heck if they don't fit, I can send them back. Well needless to say they didn't fit,they were comfortable but too big. So if you order them DEFINITELY ORDER YOUR TRUE SIZE. I tried to send them back but turned out it was cost effective enough, so I kept them and gave them away."
1.0,Runs VERY small. Material is thick. Nice slant pockets on the side. Ended up giving it to my 8 yo though & it fit her perfectly.
1.0,Super cheaply made waste of money. Don‚Äôt buy.
1.0,This outfit stretched out so quickly that I can't wear it. It was cute but now it is a dress.
1.0,I used the size chart but couldn‚Äôt even get it over my thighs
1.0,Cheap if they break who cares.
1.0,Every thread is sticking out and it came with the zipper broken. I‚Äôm angry. I got this dress for my wedding and it looks like my little sister made it out of a pillow case
1.0,No lo esperaba m√°s bonito pero est√° muy sencillo
1.0,It did not have any stretch and it is needed when going over the chest area.
1.0,Super stretchy but super clingy doesn‚Äôt hang straight it clings to each other.
1.0,battery died at the 6 month mark and is virtually impossible to replace.  Do not waste your money.
1.0,It's not sized properly I purchased it for my 10 month old goes on great large neck opening but face opening is very very small so it doesn't even fit him I would repurchase if it adjusted the face opening
1.0,La tela muy fr√°gil
1.0,Not sure why the photo shows this as a flowy long angled shirt because it is straight across. Doesn‚Äôt look one bit like the picture. Sending it back!
1.0,Broke on the second day :(
1.0,The material is super cheap feeling and uncomfortable to me
1.0,It had already turned green in places an looks super cheap. Yes I know it's not top dollar jewelery but this ring looked awful in person. My review is being blocked by a sensitivity thing but it's blocked because I told the truth about it turning green before I even received the ring!!
1.0,See through and cut fumnt
1.0,Ordered medium cushioned but received light.
1.0,"I was really hoping the gaiter would work the way reviews on here said it did.  Nope.  Made of lycra and nylon and made in China.  It was hot around my neck and did not wick moisture away, at all.  The only redeeming quality is that it is easy to lift up over your nose and mouth as a face protector."
1.0,One of the straps is twisted and you can't undo it to fix it
1.0,This looked very different than the picture and would not suggest buying unless for a costume.
1.0,"It's beautiful in the picture, but it's so small, you can't hardly read it.  I don't want to complain too much, it was only $5.99.  But it is misrepresented in the pictures.  It's not as thick, and it's not as big as the pictures make it look.  I see no trace of Rose in the silver either.  It's just silver.  I believe this is  referred to as false advertising."
1.0,Got these glasses on Sunday did not wear them until Tuesday today is Wednesday and they are broke...they were cute
1.0,Too small...i asked for a large and got a size 2
1.0,I like it just wish it fit like it should
1.0,"Waste of money,"
1.0,I wear a medium in juniors I got this dress an was way to short. A medium was the size for a bug kid . its black an white not beige an black . very disappointed!
1.0,"Item size chart is not reliable. Too small, item feels cheap material is dull and ugly"
1.0,"The quality is very low, It does not look like in the pictures"
1.0,Not as they appear..there is absolutely no shine other than the stones.  They are also very heavy and both posts were bent horribly.  Sad day
1.0,"Exactly 1 month to the day and the thing is dead! Won't charge, won't turn on...<br /><br />I charged it up 2 days ago and ended up not using it. Today, I really needed it and it wouldn't turn on. I assumed that maybe I had left it on by mistake and tried to charge it. Wouldn't charge. Save your money."
1.0,First Time I wore them they would not stay in place. Kept working their way down my thighs while peddling.
1.0,This is advertised as 925 sterling and I loved it on first sight. However I noticed that the clasp is getting an orange cast to it which means it is a base metal and that is deceptive. I would never purchase an item that is base metal because I know it is a short wear and is usually a one and done
1.0,it was too lose and it gave me no shape
1.0,I was so disappointed to find that every zipper on the jacket was either stuck or broken.
1.0,"While this jewelry was comfortable, I was sadly disappointed to receive it without some of the gemstones attached. I returned one of the necklace sets because I could not repair that myself. I was able to repair the missing gems in the other. Some super glue and all was fine. Though after one wear more gems fell out and now I cannot find them. I was really disappointed."
1.0,I am not sure how long the product supposed to last but this one broke after 7 months.
1.0,These socks came with holes in them that were noticeable as soon as I opened the package. I am not pleased.
1.0,There are two things I have bought on Amazon I have not been happy with.  This is one of them. Yeah it runs large and I expected that. What I didn‚Äôt expect was buying something I can‚Äôt get the wrinkles out of from packaging. No one professional or amateur can get the wrinkles out. So into the trash it goes. Lesson learned.
1.0,"They said the product was made in Switzerland but are actually made in China, and by hard case they mean plastic zip bag. Also they have the product number on the lens which you can‚Äôt remove"
1.0,Blouse was too short. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,The pictures of this product is not what actually received. I am very disappointed and I hate that I wasted even a $1.00 on it. Worst money I spent to date
1.0,literally broke the day i got it. Very poor quality. Ive bought less exspensive watches with more quality.
1.0,Cheaply made. The charm had air bubbles on it. Returned.
1.0,"I adore the fit and feel of these spanx.  It does exactly what I need it to - smoothes me out and snatches my waist perfectly under pants.  I‚Äôve gone through several pairs and like many others have stated, my biggest criticism is the quality for the price.  I bought my first 3 pairs from Macy‚Äôs and then I bought the next pair from Amazon because it was $10 cheaper.  I‚Äôve gotten anywhere from 3 to 8 wears out of each - and that‚Äôs always with me being incredibly careful with handling.  As soon as there‚Äôs even the tiniest snag, it grows into a huge hole almost immediately and then the garment becomes useless.  Sucks because the material is the perfect thickness - it‚Äôs just not durable.  If it was $10, hell even $20, I wouldn‚Äôt mind as much.  Absolutely unacceptable at almost $70.  I just purchased another pair from Amazon, hoping to take advantage of the lower price.  Unfortunately the price-point is now the same as Macy‚Äôs.  And when I opened the package upon delivery, there was a huge hole in one of the legs.üòï I returned it immediately.  I guess I‚Äôll go back to my fail-safe: cutting the feet off of medium-support stockings - and wearing under pants to get the desired effect.  I‚Äôll eventually purchase another pair from Macy‚Äôs when I have a coupon to offset the price..."
1.0,"I ordered a size 6 which is equivalent to a small... I received a 2XL! WHat‚Äôs up with that??? Worst part is, I planned on wearing the dress for a wedding the next day!"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ba8506c18ab2ea8e77b026ecde6c64e8]] Wrong age!!!
1.0,"These can't be put together without ripping them. Each in different ways!  I'll have to use tape on every single one of them.  Total garbage.  If my son hadn't already seen them and want them for his party, I would have returned or thrown them out. Never again."
1.0,"Didn't like it. I kept fussing with it as I was running, it didn't stay in place."
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt stay in place and makes protecting boot useless and dangerous for shifting because it hangs on shifter.
1.0,"ordered a 2x, will have to gift it to a size 12 friend."
1.0,"Buyer beware!!  I am huge on reviews, so believe me when I say this sweatshirt is crap!  I have been buying from Amazon for years and this is the first time I‚Äôm100% disappointed!  I actually disgusted!  This sweatshirt is not even close to the picture.  No quality what so ever to it.  The material is so cheap.  I bought the xxl and is more like a small.  Do NOT waste your money!"
1.0,"I wanted to love this, but it's paper thin, came super wrinkled. It's totally see through"
1.0,"You can't tell from the picture, but the cutouts in the shoulder are elastic which cheapens the overall look of the dress. Looked like a cheap bag on me with holes."
1.0,"Worst ever.  No matter how I wash and even hang to dry on a bucket to keep it straight, it just folds right back into itself. Too flimsy to hold a shape."
1.0,"It wasn't bad it just didn't fit quite right,which was a bummer."
1.0,"I had to return due to the size, very small, width and length."
1.0,these are kid size XL
1.0,"These are really flimsy. I didn't get to wear them because the long thin, post (the thing that goes through the piercing in your ear) broke off as soon as I took one of the earrings out of the package.<br /><br />What a waste!"
1.0,"I purchased the 6mm multi color model.  This hoop is the perfect size, I spent $15 on it and let me warn you now, they're garbage.  My septum is completely healed, I have a clicker and two 316 surgical steel larger hoops I alternate.  I purchased this to coach soccer at a school where they didn't want pronounced piercings.  I spent extra for titanium as it and 316 surgical have never given me an issue.  I wore this for less than a week when my nose got extremely irritated.  At first I thought it might be something else but swapping back to the other piercings cleared it up.  Gave it another try later and within a few days it was irritated again."
1.0,"Don't buy this pc of crap, Not worth it, This is nothing but a 99 cent pc of crap, the seller buys them for 50 cents and sell it for an up-charge of $5.99. this is nothing but a bubble gum machine item, looks nice on display, but it looks like one of those cracker jacks surprise toys,  I would send a picture, but it's so tiny on my hands"
1.0,About 2 sizes too small.  I gave it away.
1.0,The shirt arrived with wholes and the glitter was absolutely everywhere.  It's like they used glitter for crafts rather than clothes.  Don't waste your money or time!
1.0,Looks NOTHING like the picture !! It does NOT look or feel like Denim it looks like a old ladies Mumu and its way to big !! I tried to return it to the seller & I contacted them and they Never responded so i am stuck with this Ugly oversized Potato sack.. AWFUL DRESS !! Thanks for Nothing to this Seller !
1.0,"This product did not work for me.  You have to be completely flat...no pillow under your head for this product to work.  Maybe if my TV was farther up on the wall, it would have worked better.  But for me...it's a no go."
1.0,"It was just too flimsy of a fabric for my liking. Too long for a short, plump frame such as mine."
1.0,The most ludicrous watch strap design ever conceived..plus it doesn't work
1.0,We tried two of these bracelets the first one arrived broken the second one broke the first time she wore it. Love the bracelet it is very nice but falls apart too easily.
1.0,"The material is super thin ,almost see through. When you walk the anti slip ‚Äúsoles‚Äù can be felt and I found uncomfortable. My shoe size is 8.5-9, They felt small. It isn‚Äôt worth the time and effort to return them. I gave them to my daughter who is a shoe size 7narrow. I told her if she didn‚Äôt like them for her yoga class to throw them out."
1.0,"""Buyer's Don't Buy this item""!ü§®"
1.0,the firsr day i had the bracelet one end came loose had to glue it back together and a few days later same with the other end
1.0,The dress was cute but it was missing a button right at the top and they didn‚Äôt include replacements. Obviously not great quality. Had to send back.
1.0,This shoe was ordered twice. My shoe size doesn‚Äôt vary. Each time I ordered they were way small. The second pair did fit but the toe area is so tight (thin) it hurt n scrunched my toes all day (I was at work). Glue around front looks cheap. Too expensive for what they‚Äôre selling. Not much support. Go with Sketchers Go Walk! On sale a few places.
1.0,"not good quality and the color of the ring I got was very discolored. it came in a cheap ass bag and is not real silver or anything close to it. was very lightweight and flimsy, couldn't even gift it."
1.0,Defective joycon straps.  Strap adjuster is not oem. See picture.
1.0,This thing is a piece of CRAP! Do not buy it!
1.0,"Both toes arrived scuffed right out of the box. These appear to be an onion-skin thin layer of pleather atop material so where the pleather is gone, the material pokes through. No fixing that. They fit tight and there‚Äôs a bulge on the instep of the R boot that causes pain with each time you put weight on your right foot. If you‚Äôre a one-legged cowgirl, no problem. Need two legs, no bueno. The heels are scuffed in an odd place - where the heel meets the boot. That could be because the heel is too big for the boot and it juts out weirdly. Idk. If I were to ask someone to buy me the most ridiculous, uncomfortable pair of boots possible, these would be it. AND WHERE WAS THE CUTE ACCESSORY???"
1.0,"Beautiful print and full skirt, but the top is laughably small, even for a petite frame. There isn't enough fabric to cover my chest without wearing a cami underneath. That's a deal breaker for me. I would say order 2-3 sizes up. I had to return."
1.0,I'm a size 11 so I order up a size 12 and it's shoe it's still too small!!<br />Sinding back
1.0,la mascara esta muy bien lo √∫nico malo que no te mandan la talla que pides no recomiendo esta vededor<br />no la compren
1.0,Worthless if you're plus size!!!! NO SUPPORT IN THE BUST!!!  This is a strapless dress!!! Boobs need support. Returned immediately
1.0,very inaccurate .I returned It. Ordered an M it looked and fitted like an XS
1.0,Looks nothing like picture. Not for petite.
1.0,They did not fit . couldnt even get on my foot.
1.0,I bought these because in the pic they look like they are pink and green..... but in reality they are red and green. Plus they were a tight on my head. I sent them back
1.0,Fell apart immediately!! Never got a chance to wear it
1.0,These shade fell part after a couple days.
1.0,"This dress took forever to arrive, I ordered it because I was a bridesmaid. Once this dress arrived I opened the package and it smelled soooooo bad like rotten fish! I washed it Several times! It still had a slight smell at time of the wedding. The whole dress makes no sense, the slit is in the wrong spot, the built in bra is awkward, not to mention the material doesn't breath at all! I ended up just throwing this dress in the garbage after the wedding. Not worth it for the price at all"
1.0,"Enormous. Cheap fabric, and does not look like picture."
1.0,The plastic shield is small and makes my face sweaty.
1.0,Been a month and both rubber ringlets snapped.
1.0,the material was very stiff and firm. i have tried to wear the mask more to see if it wouldnt be as stiff but nothing. my boss has one and her material is completely different. hers is soft and flexible but firm enough to stay in place. im very disappointed
1.0,Just got this and in trying to open the cuff to look like the picture (as it was bent to where the tail touched the nose) it broke. Didn't even get to try it on.
1.0,Fell apart the fabric did
1.0,What an absolute waste of money.. the thing barely covered my nipple!
1.0,This product is not like in the picture. The chains are short & tight pulling the bracelet up onto your hand and not fitting right. Very disappointed with it...
1.0,"I received a dirty worn top with deodorant stains. Also, the stitching on the shirt was not quality. There are many frayed  strings hanging from the top."
1.0,These look very cheap and are much smaller than they look.
1.0,The buttons fell off immediately. Basically as I was taking it out of the sack they fel off . So cheap/
1.0,"Yep, the leopard print is extremely see through. Also runs a bit small. I'm a large and would try an xl."
1.0,Not good. Started to fall apart as soon as I took it out of the package. Feathers everywhere. I ended up just throwing it away. Was very disappointed.
1.0,"If I saw this in a store, I would not pay $4 for it. The material has no structure, and the straps are flimsy. The band does not adjust, and the end result is a sloppy looking. I am normally a 32dd, and I ordered a large. It barely fits, but I won't wear it, not even for 5 minutes of fun. But, hey, it only took 6 weeks to get here."
1.0,"Bad material, so big and cheap"
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt even the right color or size
1.0,"I found that the quality of these shirts was less than stellar. They are very thin, not flattering and did not fit true to size."
1.0,"The initials were very sloppy and blurry, not clear at all"
1.0,I was excited to wear this dress at the beach but it looks more like a 1980‚Äôs granny nightgown. V-neck is not low as it is shown and described in the product details. There are 2 layers of fabric because the top striped layer is somewhat see through. The the white 2nd layer is hemmed directly in the front/center of the dress... not on the side which is how all clothes are hemmed. It is 95% polyester 5% spandex- cheap  feeling fabric looks more like a Halloween costume- Maybe I should be a 1980‚Äôs granny this year! Total disappointment. I will be returning this item for a refund.
1.0,"The color was not the same at all, it has purple in it, very thin and cheap looking, and not flannel. Plus they charge $4 to return it and mine was still in the plastic! Dont waste your time or money"
1.0,"Junk, didn‚Äôt work"
1.0,Does not look like the picture. The green is a different color and it's a different material!
1.0,Looks like a dress.
1.0,Not as described at all... Definitely cheap and not worth it.
1.0,I had to return this because it is obviously not for American plus sized women.
1.0,cheap material:( ripped before I had a chance to wear it. its hot but they need better material.
1.0,Fabric was thin and flimsy and was too small.
1.0,Ive had my boots for less than 2 weeks and the stitching is fraying the lace just broke and one of the places the lace crosses up the boot broke my 4th day of having them. If your looking for a steel toe work boot please trust me and spend a little extra for a better quality boot. I already need to buy a new pair. Total waste of money
1.0,"I could make this mask myself, but it still wouldn‚Äôt work.  This face shield is a rectangular piece of plastic with two strips of sponge-like material at the top and bottom of the plastic shield (just as pictured on Amazon).  There is no indentation for the nose, so you are left trying to position the sponge under your nose, and it doesn‚Äôt stay.  The mask is supposed to be held in place with elastic straps, but there is no way to adjust the length.  The straps on the mask I received were too long to hold the mask against my face.  I regret that I spent $15.22 on something that is cheaply constructed and doesn‚Äôt even work."
1.0,The material is so thin that it‚Äôs see through. DO NOT order as a thermal.  They are okay as pajamas if you don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs see through.
1.0,"Horrible product.  First off, all 3 shirts were made of different materials. Second, all 3 shirts, while labeled XXL, were different sizes. Third, NONE of the shirts that arrived were men's XXL.<br /><br />I wear XL in nearly every brand. I'm 6'2"", 240 lbs. Each of these was above my waistline and fit tight like a wife beater.<br /><br />Absolute trash. Do NOT order."
1.0,Was excited when I got it then I noticed you can see through it. Bummer
1.0,Not a flattering cut for the mature figure.
1.0,Arm holes are too small
1.0,Came chipped on the bottomüòíüòû
1.0,"DO NOT PURCHASE! This product is hideous. This is more of a long sleeve shirt made out of cheap material with a hood, it definitely isn‚Äôt fleece lined, and is very awkward. The images that are supposed to be on the sleeves, are actually on the elbows. I‚Äôve never had such a poor experience when buying anything on Amazon, this is the WORST!!!"
1.0,This dress did not like anything like the picture. I ordered a size 10 for my daughter and it was so long. I had to return the dress. Very disappointed.
1.0,Loved it when it came in. Soft and warm. BUT .... the seams came undone after just one wear. Poor quality. I wouldn‚Äôt waste my money. Buy something higher quality.
1.0,Material was thin and cheap feeling.
1.0,"I bought this after my daughter was born to wear while my other compression band was being washed (it's the $17 one on Amazon). The material was not very sturdy and I felt like whatever compression was taking place came from the seams. No matter how tight I put it on, it still felt like there wasn't enough support where I wanted it the most. The material also snagged really easily when I washed it. The edges rolling up was another major drawback. I was always having to excuse myself to straighten it out again. The other one I had didn't do it nearly as much. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this. The cheaper one was the best one."
1.0,"I usually wear an xs/s in tops, needed a large. The arm holes are cut small and in a very unflattering way. This is not cut like majority of tank tops. The design starts far too low on the shirt‚Ä¶half the design is on my butt."
1.0,These are extremely thin and in my opinion poor quality!
1.0,This does not stay in place. Keeps slipping.
1.0,Product doesn‚Äôt remain in a straight position. Very cheaply created.
1.0,Not 1 of these snap in. The top literally just falls right off. Wasted my money.
1.0,Does not fit a 35 chest as recommended in details could not even close jacket and paid 30 dollars for rush shipment Xx large is a small
1.0,"This swim suit is a bright blue, not a soft dusty blue it shows. It has a white trim around it and the stitching looks extremely cheap. Not the same suit at all as pictured. It looks much classier in the picture."
1.0,It turned color in three days.
1.0,The arm length is very short.  The material is super scratchy and itchy.  Thin and gross.
1.0,"We bought two of these costumes... The costume zipper ripped on the first use. We bought another one because we needed it for our school fundraiser. After one (light) use, the bottom of the costume developed holes. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,Wore once and looks cheap
1.0,Looked different in picture. Cheap material
1.0,Lenses are not dark at all. There's another review showing the difference. Not even worth the hassle to return.
1.0,"I purchased this to use as a carry-on bag when I travel, but it‚Äôs not usable.  It doesn‚Äôt smell bad - it stinks.  There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd put clothes in it, and I wouldn‚Äôt subject fellow passengers to the odor it emits, especially during a long flight.  Purchase at your own risk!  I cannot recommend it."
1.0,The dress itself is beautiful. But it was way too tight in the chest area. I got it one size bigger too. Followed chart for it. Zipping to the chest area was too tight and moving my arms was risk of ripping the dress. So chest and arms area not great. Hip area loose and movable with no problem.
1.0,It's a horrible fit nothing about it fits a person of my size never buy anything from them again okay
1.0,Wasn't built for a short person
1.0,Was a little small for the size i got. I got a large and it was too short and wide. Also stitching was kinda crooked. Not good quality.
1.0,Needed to be in the juniors category.
1.0,Its see though and no covid protection
1.0,Doesn't fit my Garmin 35.  I should have believed the other 1 star reviewers that it won't fit.
1.0,Fit a very tiny lean person.
1.0,Not satisfied with  appeareance
1.0,Didn‚Äôt last long before it turned ny wrist green
1.0,Pants came with holes in them!
1.0,Only received wristbands. No headband. Rip off for the price!
1.0,They were extremely small.
1.0,My nine year old great niece couldn't wear them.
1.0,"Arrived broken in half. Ordered as a gift for my son's masquerade dance and very disappointed he now won't have it. Also, didn't realize when I made this purchase that this product is non-returnable. Not worth the money in my opinion."
1.0,Not as cute as I anticipated. Appears to be very cheap quality.
1.0,Tht the color wasn't red it was more like burgundy with glittery spects then solid red
1.0,"Absolutely, not what's advertised!!"
1.0,"At this point I‚Äôm so tired of trying to find a good leg warmer on Amazon. This is the second pair I have bought that has come and has been disappointing with the quality. The leg a warmers came and definitely do not appear as the photo. I thought maybe they had a design I. The fabric due to the picture but they don‚Äôt, ok fine I can get over that, however also in the photo it shows a very nice thick band at the top and bottom of the leg warmers. Mine had a small band only two finger lengths wide. The picture definitely makes it appear that the band is thicker. The material is. It super thick. I‚Äôm interested to give these a try to at least see if they hold up on my leg unlike the other pair I had bought. All I. All don‚Äôt bother buying, especially if you like the appearance in the photo.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />2/10 leg warmers are now falling apart at the seems. Very upset as they shouldn‚Äôt be falling apart already"
1.0,The fabric was odd and not nearly as cute as the picture.
1.0,Horrible broke as soon as I got it.
1.0,My bracelet started to discolor after just a few wears‚Ä¶
1.0,Made in china. Says it might cause cancer! No thank u! Return!
1.0,To big for my wrist. Had to wrap it 3 times nd still to big. Cross fell off within hours of wearing it. Would not purchase again. Beads were nice just a shame it's so big.
1.0,Cute dress but one of the straps broke
1.0,"I loved it when I initially opened the package, however, I wore it once to my high school reunion and by the end of the night, it was tarnished and dull.  It was definitely a single-use item."
1.0,Too  big.. looks cheap
1.0,"Returned.. Hangs like it was on a hanger no shape. Flimsy material wanted a dress to wear to lunch. Looks like a nightgown, no body. Cheap."
1.0,"If you are looking for a super tiny, somewhat flimsy, kids size rollerboard, this one is for you. Otherwise try something else."
1.0,Broke in four months!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:950ec4e68908cf14b7a3466f230be5f9]] Fresh out of the package and tried it on. Took it off and all the aliens are falling off.
1.0,Not impressed. The heads were not wrapped up for protection. Not the size I ordered
1.0,Thin see through material. Cheap. Too bad.
1.0,Was for my coworker‚Äî‚Äî-can‚Äôt give them to her‚Äî‚Äî
1.0,One earring! Don't be fooled!!
1.0,Really!!! The half-island Cremea is a part of Ukraine!!!
1.0,I could not wear them even though I do not have a thick instep.
1.0,I've said this before -- the size is about 2-3 sizes smaller than US sizes.
1.0,These masks are completely flat and not mask shaped at all. The material hangs very loosely past the chin and over the nose sort of defeating the purpose of a protective covering.<br />10/10 do not recommend
1.0,How do you wear the skirt and not let everyone have a show?!?!
1.0,"Cheaply made, too big from straps down so I dont get the support I need. Throwing it away..I wouldn't even sleep in it."
1.0,"But these pants should definitely be 15$ not leather or even leather looking, they remind me of a garbage bag, I was upset, the 1 star is for the good shipping"
1.0,I have had these shoes for less than one month and there is already a hole through the side! I expect a pair of shoes to last longer than one month  I do not recommend these shoes! Save your money!
1.0,Terrible!!!!!!! Do not buy. Go look on Amazon for something better. There are so many options of shorts and this isn't it!!!! Save your hard working money. These shorts are a rip off.
1.0,Looks very very cheap in person. The bracelet is much nicer. I wish they'd have wrapped this in the same material as the bracelet and put it on a leather cord. Would've been much more appropriate than the cheap gold chain.
1.0,I rarely leave a bad review but this crap product left me no choice. Day 4 and the strap broke!!!! Wasted money.
1.0,"The shipping was immediately; however, I am giving 1 star because the charm only  lasted 2 weeks. It is really beautiful but you can't wet it. The words ran down and the charm silvery colour  discolored really bad."
1.0,No sirve los dijes se caen y el trabadero igual muy mala calidad
1.0,Such a cute tank. Wanted it for working out but it is WAAAAY too small!  Went to return it only to find out I also have to pay for postage and a possible restocking fee. Forget it....I'll just give the shirt away.
1.0,"My belly button rejected these baddd. Ended up having to take out after I had major swelling, pain, puss and redness. I‚Äôve had my belly button pierced for 11 years now and have never experienced this with any other jewelry."
1.0,Nothing cotton about this dress not as expected
1.0,Horrible material and looks better on someone that is thinner
1.0,The black floral Kimono is not what is pictured above: the sleeves are much shorter than what is shown. Overall the item itself is also short and doesn't have the nice open sides as shown. If you're looking for something long and flowly....then definitely don't purchase this.
1.0,poor quality material.  poor fit.  Came with holes where sewing missed it's marks.
1.0,"I opened the box & the watch was already ticking! Meaning the battery life is already in motion! Now I'm going to have to get a new battery soon. If they're going to ship with the battery already running, please include a new replacement battery. Just pitiful!"
1.0,The material is very scratchy. It‚Äôs very flimsy! The legs are too short and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô4. The elastic around the waist has no style and isn‚Äôt even causing a section in the back to bulge out. I was really surprised by the poor quality of this!
1.0,Not big enough to be a adult necklace
1.0,Not at all to size.. ordered a large as normal and it only fit on my back.. so gave it to my daughter who is a small normally and doesn't even fit her too small... worst waist trainer I've ever purchased.. so you might have to order triple your size if you get this product..
1.0,Three earring pieces were broken upon arrival! And I called to let them know and I was asked to return the whole package even though not all were broken.
1.0,"Arm holes were very large and the sides of my bras were hanging out. Tried different kinds of bras, still didn‚Äôt cover"
1.0,"I purchased these leggings for a trip to Scotland.  What a mistake!  When these legging arrived I noticed they were pretty see through like tights, not leggings.  Since I was wearing them with a very long shirt, I kept them.  Big mistake.  The material these leggings are made from are rough and scratchy.  These were nothing like the solid black leggings I bought from the same provider here.  However, the blue ones were awful. I bought a second pair of black ones and they were as soft as the first.  These are made by a different company.  I wore them on an airline flight across country and by the time I got to Washington DC, I was rummaging through my carry-on looking for my black pair.  The blue ones had rubbed my skin raw.<br /><br />Buy the black ones but skip the navy pair.  These are way to see through to be called leggings.  If I hadn't thrown away the packaging I would have returned these horrible leggings.<br /><br />Zero Stars"
1.0,You can see the stitching and it's uneven. Super Sad about it!!
1.0,Shoe was too large.  I wear 9-10 and this 10 was not a good fit.  Was very wobbly as quality was not great.
1.0,I wouldnt buy this. I've only worn it twice and the stone fell out
1.0,"Fell apart really fast, never had converse do that before?"
1.0,Really like the look and feel of the product. Unfortunately within the first hour of wearing the it the stitches in the underarm came loose to create a lovely hole. Not a real good look at work!<br /><br />By end of day it completely ripped down from the armpit to waist. It‚Äôs found a home in the trash immediately when arriving home.
1.0,"Was excited to find this oversized cotton/poly blend white sweatshirt. Price was ideal and photo reflected exactly what I was seeking.  When the item arrived, it was a HUGE white knit sweater, 100% polyester, with 4 inch rolled up cuffs at end of each sleeve.  It was definitely not what was reflected on the model photo.  Returned item promptly next day."
1.0,Wore them once and the arm broke
1.0,"Have had the watch for literally 3 days and it‚Äôs already broken. Tried putting it on and tightening it to fit my wrist, when the metal clip broke off. Now I can‚Äôt wear the watch."
1.0,This shoes are for babies not tweens!
1.0,"The neckline was not fitted properly, you can‚Äôt tell front from back.<br />Advertised as free returns, Attempted to return the item and there is no option to return at all!!<br />Do not fall victim to this company, it is a scam!"
1.0,"These are not girls sizes, they were toddlers.  Wouldn't even fit over 10 year old's head."
1.0,Turned black inside earrings
1.0,didnt like it at all
1.0,"The colors are nice, but I am definitely disappointed that I was leaning over my desk and the untractable reel  got caught under my desk and broke off. I have only had it for about 3 weeks."
1.0,"This item was badly sewn, I have requested a return from manufacturer which can take 2 days to respond. In a couple of days I will update with photos. If I can return it for refund, I won't post pictures. I will just update that I was satisfied with transaction. Fits fine, Very Warm. It looks cheaply made. I thought I ordered it from Amazon Prime, which makes returns much easier:( No one wants to spend $60 and not be able to return for a refund."
1.0,It broke And the second day I had it it‚Äôs not me very well at all
1.0,"Sunglasses are shown as polarized and do not pass the simple reflection test. Unfortunately, this is just more garbage that awaits us as a buyer.<br />I hope you read this review before you buy"
1.0,"Cheap Quality Fabric, Thin. Returned."
1.0,These look like they came from the $1 bin at a party store... they look cheaper than the photo.
1.0,"Very disappointed with this.  My granddaughter was thrilled to get it as a Christmas gift, but I discovered yesterday that the decals had all washed off after a few washes, and she is now left with a plain sweatshirt.  Such a disappointment."
1.0,These earrings are junk.  They absolutely will not stay on your ear.  The earring on the model's ear must be glued on.  They are too long to stay on the ear.
1.0,"I really liked the dark color so ordered it in med, was too small, then ordered it in large, the only difference was the arms were a bit bigger, not bigger around the shirt,  the large came with tags in the bottom of the bag, off the shirt and buttons close to falling off.  don't bother with it, not worth the hassle of returning the thing!"
1.0,I didn‚Äôt order this item and I don‚Äôt understand the how to use it
1.0,"Was lovely when I first got it.  Perfect length, shimmered when I moved.  At first I loved it.  By the end of the first week, the part that touched my neck had turned dark.  I thought it might have been tarnishing from the oils in my skin but when I took it off and looked closer I realized that it was only silver plated and was about to turn my skin green.  Sorry that I didn't notice it sooner so I could return it and very disappointed over all."
1.0,Looks a used pair of pants and WAY TO SHORT!
1.0,"Great color, but too short & too small"
1.0,"The backings were on backwards so shiny side doesn‚Äôt show. Didn‚Äôt want to bother with return because they weren‚Äôt expensive, wearing them anyway with the dull side showing."
1.0,It was not as pictured when I received it.  It was sent in a flat envelope.
1.0,It's extremely cute but the ring part kept falling off. So eventually it just snapped when I walked on it long enough. Unfortunately only lasted me a few hours.
1.0,Style is cute but had to return because it wasn't true to size. You have to order 2 to 3 sizes up
1.0,Purchased for my seven year old it they are WAY TOO SMALL!!
1.0,Product was too large. The material is very thin and cheap. Feels worse then a costume. I'm very disappointed that I wasted money on this I'm 5'2 102lbs double D and the Xsmall dress was too large went way past my knees too big in the chest and waist looks like a giant orange sack.
1.0,I wore bracletfir 1 hour. To lunch. I took it off soon as got home it didnt just chip it totally. Broke the whole braclet...wouldrate zeri star but not option
1.0,did not fit. poor quality. i threw them in the trash.
1.0,It was all damaged with tint.
1.0,Very dumb
1.0,"There wasn't a problem with the order.. this was the second purchase... the first was too large so I gave it away.  The second one (medium ) fit, but offered no support. I am a 36 C.. and this bra gave no definition at all to my &#34;upper body&#34;.  It looks terrible when I wear it unless I wear an extra large tshirt. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this if using for walking or running or working out."
1.0,Broke in first use :(
1.0,The neck is so big it falls to the side. Awkward pattern for a shirt.  WIll never buy from this seller again.
1.0,"Cheap, not well made, no good"
1.0,"good looking, colours vibrant. few came loose out of housing<br /><br />update (from 4 to 1 star:<br />after 5 months new (still in package) begins to loose its color and have black spots (seet picture)"
1.0,Very cheaply made. Returned. Felt they would have fallen apart the first time they were worn.
1.0,I only got one earring in my shipment.  I needed two.  I had no idea it was just one or I would not have ordered.  I can‚Äôt imagine the reason I only got one.
1.0,"Very small hat, more a child size. The knit section separated from the &#34;fur&#34; section in about 20 minutes."
1.0,they came broken
1.0,"Bought these a few weeks ago and the inside is already tearing apart. Buy some more expensive ones that will last longer, I am!"
1.0,"No grip. Slip hazard. Asked for refund, company ignored me. Stole my money and sold me a dangerous product."
1.0,"NOT WIND PROOF IN THE LEAST.  There's a GIANT gap between the lense and the frame of the goggles, A GIANT GAP!  Absolute garbage...  The gap is so big I wouldn't even trust these to play Airsoft or Paintball in...  Absolute garbage, don't waste your money."
1.0,The shoes were ok for the most part. But they did not fit and I even got the 6.5-7.5. I wear a 7. They send you clear bra straps in order to get the shoes to stay on and they did not help at all what so ever. So I was wearing floppy sandals the whole time basically.
1.0,"Not impressed! Was super excited about this dress sadly it is cheap fabric, super short dress. I'm 5'1 and 135lbs I could not raise my arms withou it showing my lady parts."
1.0,It‚Äôs cute but can‚Äôt breathe in it
1.0,Got this bands for my Galaxy Watch 4 and this watch bands design is just horrible.  Does not fit correctly and it just looks bigger and does not fit well.<br /><br />Waste of money üí∞
1.0,"SMALL! i wear a L-XL so i ordered the XL and it fits like a medium. The under skirt doesn't even cover my butt and it definitely won't zipper closed in the back. Pretty dress, but cheap material. but you get what you pay for. So, order at least two sizes up."
1.0,"I did not receive the product pictured here. The top (more like a dress) that I received did not have the cut out shoulders and it was slant to one side only, more like a side slit, rather than high in front and low in the back as shown in the picture. Clearly I received the wrong item."
1.0,This dress came in a dark hunter green color (not an emerald green as shown) it does not have any white trim and isn‚Äôt a vneck.
1.0,"May work for a child, woman or small man.<br />Material is like a pair of panties."
1.0,"The ends break after about two-three weeks of use. Otherwise, these things are awesome. Just sucks that the rubber ends that attach to the glasses break after awhile."
1.0,"I ordered this item for a gathering and I couldn‚Äôt wear it because it was to small, I ordered the size I typically wear and this item did not fit not sure if there clothing runs small or if it was the material but I‚Äôm really upset and I can‚Äôt even get my money back."
1.0,Ring is very poor quality
1.0,The snaps stick and they hit my knuckle and made me bleed. Look out!
1.0,"The glasses arrived broken, with one arm twisted out of shape.  They are the right size for my small face, and would have fit well and looked great, had they been at all wearable."
1.0,The style is cute but way too thin of material
1.0,I ordered a men's large. The shirt I received was way too small very disappointed. Will not order from this place ever again. My grandson was very disappointed. I gave it one star because I liked the graphic
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt even fit it‚Äôs totaly poor quality
1.0,I was so disappointed with this dress. It looked so cute on in the pic online.  Not the case when I received it and there were a lot of loose threads everywhere that should have been trimmed before distribution.  It didn't fit me well either.  Probably would fit better on a small chested woman. I ordered a medium so the length was good but the seem hit right in the middle of my breasts so it looked really awkward on.  I'm a 36C (sometimes 34D depending on how the item is made) so that may have had something to do with where the seem landed.
1.0,"Horrible material, extremely cheap and I'll-fitting and had a hole in the front right when I opened it. Save your money, I wish I could get mine back."
1.0,The fabric is not of good kind.
1.0,The watch is not working. No numbers are showing. It seems the battery dead. I need this matter resolved right away. I was looking forward to getting my watch but end up with a broken one.
1.0,I usually wear a XXL in t shirts with room to spare however these fit like spandex and the material much the same. Not what I expected cotton to be.
1.0,"I've purchased four shirts from the Allegra store that fit according to size; very pretty too.<br /><br />Unfortunately these shirts, both in black and pink are very long and do not fit correctly; we purchased both small and medium in the pink. Also, as mentioned by others, the pink is very PJ looking."
1.0,Boots arrived on time but leather was completely covered in mildew. Returned.
1.0,I am so bummed! Dress is darling but the large is made for someone with a size A cup. I happen to have double Ds and I couldn't zip it from mid back up. It fit everywhere else and the length was perfect. It also came 2 days late. I needdd this dress for an event and now I have nothing and no time to get something else.
1.0,"very cheap, not at all what was advertised.  the straps were spindly and the padding was mishapen."
1.0,"Floral print is junk, not a cover up at all just a super thin blouse dress and runs waaaaay small"
1.0,They are NOT CAPRIS and very very high waisted.  you need to be at least 5'8&#34; not joking if you are short these will come to your tits!!!! Im 5'5 i look like  erkil. description is terrible and material is more like yoga pants not leggings
1.0,Breaks very easily after wearing it once. Needs to be constructed better. Very disappointed!  Had to glue the ring and regarding link the chain.
1.0,5 of 6 pairs have holes in the seams either upon opening the package or wearing once.
1.0,"This should  have laser longer but taking it a jewler and told me over paid for this chain since its stainless steel, not silver. The joke was on me especially since I've tried to contact the sellers and got nothing in return."
1.0,"THESE RUN SMALL IN SIZE,  I ENDED UP SUEING ONLY AROUND THE HOUSE CAUSE THEY ARE TOO SMALL"
1.0,every day use not good lasted a short time
1.0,"This is a terribly inferior sandal. Within a week of purchase, the soles were falling off and the elastic in the heal band, was breaking down. We contacted Amazon and they said they'd do a &#34;one time&#34; replacement. The new pair came and the same thing promptly happened. Although my wife has always liked Born sandals, these are no good. I bought her a pair of Clark's that are working out fine. Don't buy these, they're awful!"
1.0,Definitely not what I expected. Never even wore it
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt look like the picture and is honestly really ugly.
1.0,"This is a really neat idea, but it is in no way silver. It tarnished and changed colors a week after I got it. Very disappointed."
1.0,"These socks are a terrible product. I just received them. The first day I wore them, when I took them of my feet were COVERED with the material from the sock. I was at home doing chores around the house. I would recommend you look for a much better product."
1.0,"Nice band, bad allergic reactions"
1.0,"Bad quality, I had to return the product. Also, I got a Lg, but the chest area did not fit properly."
1.0,"These were advertised as ""blue blocking"", but actually only block the ultra-violet, not the blue spectrum.  In the insert that came with the glasses it says it blocks ""UVA / UVB"" (ultraviolet) and does not claim to block anything in the blue light spectrum."
1.0,Very small for a size medium
1.0,"Cheap plastic, broke in under a month, had to toss."
1.0,"These stockings do not stay up! They are poorly made, the color is streaky. I had them on less than an hour before i threw them in the garbage."
1.0,"Won‚Äôt stay running after being wound. Bought a second one because I waited to long for return.  Stupid move, won‚Äôt run after being wound.  So what that it is a neat looking watch, it‚Äôs useless. But, the $500 dollar ones are the same. Directions are useless."
1.0,"I would like to give this company a ""no star"" rating because the item which was advertised on Amazon has been discontinued by Pollard and American West. I was informed of this yesterday. The item (bracelet)  should not show up as an option for purchase on Amazon, yet it still is.  I purchased this bracelet as a birthday gift for a friend who just turned 81, and I was happy to be sending it to her. From the description, ""American West Sterling Silver Multi Gemstone Choice of 5 Different Colors Interchangeable Cuff Bracelet Size S, M or L"", the ad is extremely misleading. I learned yesterday from a C. Pollard rep that there are NO interchangeable gemstones (as shown in the photo) that come with the bracelet. Furthermore, the item has been discontinued but unfortunately still being advertised and sold on Amazon under C Pollard and American West."
1.0,"way too small for me.  I could uncomfortably get it on but it looked terrible and cheap.  Nothing great to say about it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. I test every product before reviewing. My experience may not match every other reviewers but my experiences are what I base the reviews on. If you felt I was helpful, please click yes below. If not, please comment and offer suggestion on how I can improve my review for you"
1.0,"Way too small, tag not right, I measured."
1.0,Fake as hell cheap nasty
1.0,"Extremely synthetic material. You cannot use sanitary napkins because nothing sticks. These panties are like made of thick panty hose material.<br />Also, you put them on, they look fine. In a couple of hours, the elasticity is gone!! They are for one time use only."
1.0,Was from China. No size tag in shirt. Fit was tight for xl
1.0,Dress was extremely too big. The stitching made the dress look extra cheap. Purchased a number of dresses from this vendor and this is the first dress I was very disappointing in the buy.
1.0,"I gave this one star only because the color is accurate. I thought this was a good deal. The zipper doesn‚Äôt work, the fabric is flimsy, and it looks so cheap. Pay more for better quality. I can‚Äôt even try them on because the zipper doesn‚Äôt work!!"
1.0,"It was TERRIBLE, too small, and ugly. Cheap too. Do not suggest buying it unless your kids head is shaped like a hot air balloon and likes the feeling of metal on their temples all night. This will not fit an adult unless they have a small head and very thin hair, if even."
1.0,This dress material feels like a swimming suit and clings like one too. Does your camisole have a hem? That'll show. Does your bra line leave a blip in your back? That'll show. I'm a little baffled by the good reviews. Every imperfection shows in this dress. It's going right back!
1.0,"Came completely crooked defected out of bag, super flimsy not worth the money at all. Very disappointed. Not even costume quality. Worst then that. Not uv protective"
1.0,"keychain is cute but diamonds are falling out, sad.."
1.0,Too thin and cheap. They unfortunately snapped the first time I wore them.
1.0,"1 star because if they weren't so cheaply made they would be very nice pairs of dangles. So much potential to be better! One red dangle is darker red than the other and may come with missing chains. Moon dangle will break right off the gauge because it's heavy and cheap. Both too fragile to even put on without falling apart and when I returned, my replacement came broken too lol huge disappointment as I needed them for a wedding."
1.0,"This is my second pair of earings from this company. The first pair broke at the base of the stud and fell into the center of the ball. They looked amazing but did not last but a few months. Thinking my Fianc√© might have damaged them by mistake, I replaced them with an identical pair. They broke again in less than one month. If they weren‚Äôt so flimsy they would be a quality earring. Don‚Äôt buy."
1.0,Looks like a good idea and that‚Äôs it
1.0,This dress was awful. It looked like a shower curtain. The fabric was stiff and wrinkly. The dress had no shape and was way too big and way too short. I returned it immediately.
1.0,I bought this in navy and it fits perfectly but this one is double the size and the seller didn't let me return the item.
1.0,The dress fits fine but fabric is very thin. As a result it looks cheap. I'm sending both back.
1.0,I don't like this hat. I think the embroidery is very cheaply done. A person could barely make out what the words say even up close because the letters are so close together. I'm returning.
1.0,You get what you pay for this is total and utter garbage don't waste ur money turned my neck green after a day
1.0,Ugly and doesn't fit properly
1.0,[[VIDEOID:752cb78f692e95c3368db97b16ae1490]] I received the wrong dress but I like the dress
1.0,Runs three sizes too small
1.0,I normally wear L so I ordered an XXL to be safe and it‚Äôs so tiny that I can‚Äôt zip up my devils fruit...üòë
1.0,"Way to small for an XXL, It fits my daughter and she usually wears a M."
1.0,"Cheap material, orangy red color, too short- even when worn off the shoulders, loose stitching everywhere, and cut on the smaller side. No tag inside- looks like it was made by an inexperienced seamstress who was just starting out. Can't find one redeeming quality about this top and definitely cannot recommend. Sorry!"
1.0,"I've had a Coolibar Fairway Golf Hat for a few years and it was time to replace it.  I bought the first one directly from Coolibar and it was shipped in a proper hat box.  However, when I ordered the hat through Amazon, it was shipped in a small rectangular Amazon box, and because the hat is not packable/crushable, it arrived damaged beyond repair (see photo).  I returned it and ordered one directly from Coolibar.<br /><br />The hat is great, but the shipping is ridiculous."
1.0,Stone in the center fell out before it got out of its package
1.0,This tarnished my skin and degraded the metal within a day. Don't waste your money.
1.0,where is the rest of the sweater... is this a m in youth or children?  no where is there mention of a crop sweater.  If you want a crop sweater this is PERFECT.  if you are wanting a sweater in the proportions of the image ... BEWARE!!!!
1.0,"It's Cheap, Thin, Thread is sticking out of every seam and I'm embarrased to give this as an Xmas present to my daughter. I'm not one to give bad reviews but I didnt see many for this item so I figured I could save someone from possibly making the same mistake. The item did ship fast though."
1.0,"These things hold great, there's no denying that. However, they ate the sides of my legs up. I've got scabs on the outside of both legs where these dug in so much and I only wore them for two days. If you're sitting at a desk all day, they should work great but if you actually have a job where you move around for a living and have to walk a lot, I wouldn't recommend these."
1.0,No cleaning instructions...shrunk first wash
1.0,Not true to size. Fits too small. Returned.
1.0,"Literally awful. The fabric is super stiff and not shaped AT ALL like the pictures showed. The sleeves are really loose and it‚Äôs generally unflattering. I consider giving it two stars because my husband and I got a good laugh out of it, but I definitely would NOT recommend buying the long sleeved dress. Considering giving the short sleeve one a go because the reviews seem to be slightly better, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1.0,"The style and quality of this coat are quite good, and is a bargain at the price.  The problem is sizing...this coat is definitely NOT a misses.  These coats are junior sized.  I ordered my usual size small and I could not even button it, so I tried a medium and it also was much too small.  I am a small woman (size 6) and these coats are just plain tiny.  They would fit a junior high aged girl, like my 12 year old slender granddaughter.  I was very disappointed.  If the fit was accurate I would give this coat 5 stars."
1.0,"Metal color is not gold, it's brass :("
1.0,Not as wide leg as picture shows which wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for
1.0,Bought XXL. Fit more like a large. Very small especially in arms.
1.0,Bought a size larger than I usually wear and it was still too small. They need to figure out the sizing on these things.
1.0,"I ordered a size up so it would be oversized and it fits perfect, which wasn‚Äôt my goal. If you want it oversized I recommend 2-3 sizes bigger. The material isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôm returning this if that gives you any reason not to buy this."
1.0,"I'm currently wearing a 2XL NFL licensed jersey very comfortably. I read that I should by a size or two larger than normal, so I bought a 4XL only to be disappointed in the size. The quality was terrific, but it was tight in the chest and waist while the length seemed fine. I then considered buying a 5XL, but feared the length would be far to long and 5XL does seem extreme. The return was fast and easy."
1.0,Do not buy...cheap material...u get what u pay for. Then they expect u to pay for shipping return. Not worth the time or money.
1.0,Very cheap materials used.  Probably wouldn't survive a trip through a washer.
1.0,was not easy on or off!
1.0,They arrived in a more dusty off white colour vs the pure white it advertised
1.0,Sent this watch back..I didn't like the way it fit and looked on me
1.0,Don't buy item. I am not wear it changes color
1.0,This must be made for children. I ordered a large and it barely came to mid calf and my belly was showing. I wear a size 8/10 and I am 5'5.
1.0,"Good dress for the price. Casual summer dress. I really like the ruffled sleeves. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 in 180 lb, L fits perfect. I would buy again.<br /><br />>>>>After using the dress twice it began to fell apart. A hole started to form but I am not able to saw it because if I sew this kind of fabric I would make a bigger hole.<br /><br />It is very sad because I really like the dress and it‚Äôs too late to return it."
1.0,Poor quality runs extremely small
1.0,Cute. Runs way to small. Disappointed.
1.0,"The dress is a great color, but it has black stains all over the front of it, also has about a quarter inch of excess material protruding from the top of right shoulder seam, and it runs along the seam about four or so inches. as I know hoe to sew I know this is not right. thank you, please give response."
1.0,The buckle does not latch well
1.0,Turned my entire wrist green.
1.0,Take a good look at the picture they provide. What you receive barely resembles that picture. First off they send it in a envelope. Good luck with it surviving the journey. It was crushed of course but then I doubt it ever resembled the picture. The interlocking NY was very small. The material was just some floppy cotton. I guess I can wear it when I do yardwork.
1.0,"These are not the same glasses as the photo. I ordered the glasses from these people before and wanted a second pair, but the ones they sent me look like they came out of a cracker jack box."
1.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but for me it was a bit too tight. Also, the 2nd time I went to put it on, it snapped & beads went everywhere :("
1.0,ugly glasses
1.0,"The umbrella began rusting within 2 months, now we are just waiting for it to fall apart. Very cheaply made. Do not waste your money."
1.0,"Very kool look, but cheaply made."
1.0,Visually they look good but they are terribly uncomfortable. I got blisters on both feet within 5 min of walking in them üò£ Material is very cheap and cracked easily. Definitely not worth the price they have listed.
1.0,Was not the style I was expecting at all. The first couple of pictures advertised is not of the same dress received.
1.0,Keeps breaking - not very study or well built.
1.0,"I bought 4 pairs because they look and feel so great.  But of these 4, 2 already broke within a couple of weeks.  One pair fell off my desk at work and shattered.  Maybe that is too much on me, but I've dropped plenty of sunglasses in my time and that didn't happen.  Bummer!"
1.0,"The fabric was very thin and synthetic feeling. It didn‚Äôt have that warm cozy feeling I wanted.  I bought the blue and it was a very bright cornflower blue. Some people may like it, but I didn‚Äôt. It just seemed very cheaply made. Returned it."
1.0,This is horrible. Nothing like the picture. Very thin and cheap
1.0,It was crammed in a small bag upon delivery. It smelled absolutely disgusting like old cheap jewerly. Gave me hives. Ripped it off my neck (with little effort the clasp broke) and tossed it in the trash.
1.0,These shorts did not fit right and I would not recommend buying them because this company does not take returns. They said to contact Amazon  I suppose to plead my case. These were expensive shorts for my grandson.
1.0,I hope the brown and black flecks on the tail inside the dirty bag are old food and not bugs or something worse. This was disgusting. By far the worst Amazon order I have ever had.  Yuck.
1.0,Too small! Large size is probably a size 5 if not smaller.
1.0,Was excited to receive but the colors are not as vibrant and they look cheap very cheap. At least they sent extra backs and they were wrapped like expensive jewelry üòê
1.0,size is nonadjustable and it broke very easily
1.0,I total disapointed with this product it said that it fit 4 cards on it I just put two on it I can't get them out is so hard<br />I lost my money on this product it is really awful
1.0,Its made super cheap. Didn't fit runs small ber small
1.0,I got my size and was not my size
1.0,"This shirt was very cheaply made, way too small, terrible fabric."
1.0,"These are thongs, not briefs."
1.0,"It arrived as a wrinkled mess. The fabric is awful, like the material you'd use for a flag or something. Not light & airy as in the picture, but thick heavy, non breathable stuff. I ordered the biggest size they have (I'm 5'4"", usually a XL, average to small chest) and I couldn't even get it over my shoulders/chest. Needless to say, it went back immediately. The best part about this was that they offered free returns."
1.0,"Bag was fantastic until I put it on my back and the straps came apart because for some reason they're attached with small clips. Really awful design there, clips either need to be heavy duty or just have normal backpack straps."
1.0,"Was disappointed in how thin the material was, especially for the price! PAPER THIN!"
1.0,"I bought this product and after no long it turn dark so I clean it, but the next day immediately turn dark again so I don't think is real 925 sikver, silver don't turn dark like that"
1.0,I can barely get the time to appear! It takes so much effort and then the time stays on such a short time that this was an entire waste of money
1.0,Says women's size but I received a kid size
1.0,They were just what I wanted & fit great!  Until the crotch split the first time I sat down.  Very disappointed at the poor workmanship.  I should‚Äôve read other reviews that the sewing is not up to par
1.0,Very pretty shoe but it was bigger than the size was supposed to be.  Ordered a toddler size 9 but the shoes were more like a toddler size10.5.
1.0,"As soon as I received this dress I fell in love with it.  I hung it up in my closet and saved it for when I would be newly installed as a officer into my professional organization.  The picture did not do it any justice and the dress was gorgeous and comfortable.<br /><br />So this past Saturday for the first time at my organization and I had another individual pull me to the side to tell me that I had a hole.  This was the first time that wearing the dress.  I noticed that the chiffon along both sides, from the under to the under arms to the waist was frayed as it the material dry rotted and frayed.  I was not only extremely embarrassed but also disappointed.  I will be contacting the seller."
1.0,"And the criss-cross lines that are shown as cold shoulder, the strings were included, I guess for me to sew on the shirt  Ridiculous and so cheap."
1.0,"Never had issue with wool but these break me out, even after 3 washes. Had to toss."
1.0,The inside is itchy. Not comfortable without a long sleeve under it
1.0,Poor quality and it smells bad.  It's not fluffy like the picture either.
1.0,"Poorly built, not very comfortable"
1.0,Material was too cheap. It did not look or fit like the model picture. I still haven't wore it.
1.0,This product is a lie. There is no gel inside of it at all. I even cut it open to see if there was. This thing is filled with air and will only hurt you more than help.
1.0,"Not as pictured. The shorts portion are much longer, and there's no tapering at the waist. The best use for this costume is as scrap fabric. Returning."
1.0,Didn't support as expected
1.0,Skirt saggy in the front which is strange because I have big hips.
1.0,Cheap made. Fits wrong
1.0,4 of the 12 looked like a 6 year old made them. I need to wear one of the decent looking pairs this weekend so I can‚Äôt return them.
1.0,Was not slip resistant
1.0,No me quedo ajustado.
1.0,Nice metal for your dogs collar. Unfortunately hardware that attaches it to dogs collar failed after less than a week. Metal fell off and disappeared. Nice idea. Manufacturers need to substantially improve the hardware that attaches it to your dogs collar. So much for that investment.
1.0,Poor quality. I wore it once. Very disappointed
1.0,Ran a size and a half smaller. Look in the picture the sole of a size 2 Nike is bigger than this 2.5 DEDU. It did not fit at all!
1.0,"So tiny that they will hardly cover a small lobe,very disappointed."
1.0,Disappointed in quality.
1.0,"If you're paying full price for the watch strap, it should come in the ACTUAL Daniel Wellington case. It makes me question if this is a knock off"
1.0,Size states 41-45 inches which I thought meant that those are the sizes the belt can be worn at. The belt I was sent was 41 inches long total which means it was too small. Plus the holes do not start for another four inches which means it is for waists about 37 inches and smaller.
1.0,Not at all worth the money. Instructions are worthless.
1.0,Ended up causing more pain and damage to my piercing than the normal size ring.
1.0,"Garbage shorts. Put my phone in pocket, bent over and ripped pocket wide open. Returned"
1.0,"don't have a large head but long face, and much too much pressure in  temple area of head,  and not too much of quality look cheap and part of if fell off when tried it on,  wish they would make these things where could adjust width and length of head/face hate them very disappointed.  waste of time and  money."
1.0,Cheap crap. Grommets pulled out on day one. Definitely don't buy this.
1.0,Cheap expensive trash that broke after a few uses. What a shame. Would not recommend.
1.0,Very unappealing look. Battery stopped within 2 hours of use. So disappointed. Was not even worth the energy to return.
1.0,Didn't wash well
1.0,Teeny. Pics are not depicting what I received.
1.0,They were great for a week....... THE TOP LAYER FLAKES OFF SO EASILY.. WASTED $
1.0,"They weren't even close to the size I wanted.  I needed the plus size ones and I was lucky to get my toe in them.  Very disappointing, the day I got them I sent them right back.  I'll guess I'll go with the more expensive lularoe ones...."
1.0,I seen it thought it was nice wedding attire but when I finnnnnnally received it I was in disbelief due to it not having any shape not true to color and really resembled a shower curtain maybe have a close connect with a seamstress to work it all out
1.0,I don't like that the left sandal is way to wide. Don't know if I will buy from them ever again.
1.0,I don't recommend. Looks cheap and runs small.
1.0,"Looks pretty in the picture, but it's made of tshirt feeling material, very weird for a non casual dress."
1.0,Uggg.  They hung down on my ears and they were awkward.
1.0,"I purchased white trousers (I thought). Imagine my surprise when heather gray arrived to my door, inside a bag labeled white. The workmanship on these gray sweats is also poor, one of the seams has a hole already."
1.0,Threw it away complete junk broke after one song üéµ ridiculous üôÑ
1.0,Lens is too thick to fit in frame
1.0,Bought a 4t for my 2 year old. The fit is not true to regular us sizing. The slip under the lace has no stretch and where the frill at the bottom is tapered limiting movement for a toddler. Limited movement for a toddler is a terrible situation to be in especially if this is bought for a party. Not satisfied! Waste of money!
1.0,The edges weren't finished like in the picture. the pinbacks don't hold properly. Both of these ribbons fell apart and are gone. I can't return them obviously. Waste of money.
1.0,Frustrating
1.0,Fake Pearl's.
1.0,Order a size up if you like this kind of dress otherwise you‚Äôll never used it .
1.0,"This is NOT an infinity scarf, it is a square piece of material and not at all the 38x64, measurements that was described in details. This is NOT even a regular scarf, much less infinity, this is an Arabic scarf to be used as a hadjabi(?spelling) . I am a regular Amazon shopper and have always been satisfied, but I am totally disappointed with this order, not even worth sending back, would give zero stars if possible!"
1.0,"Great price, not so great quality. Some of the bracelets were unfinished and scratch the skin."
1.0,Ripped and falling apart when I got it.  Went to return it but never sent it back because I didn't have time before my wedding. Kind of bulky and cheaply made.
1.0,Not happy with this purchase. Only 19/20 headbands were included. All of the headbands are multicolor. This is not what was advertised at all. Flowers fell off and were loose in the package. Flowers have pieces of polka dot fabric behind them; also not what was advertised. Need them for an event today so I can‚Äôt exchange. Horrible purchase.
1.0,Wore these pants twice.  After that they had a stretch mark on the right front of the thigh.  This usually only happens after wearing stretch pants for a long time.  Unfortunately my 30 days just expired. Would love a refund.
1.0,"Did not work bought twice, both time did not work, totally dead!!!"
1.0,broke within the first hour
1.0,Looks nothing like the photos.. very cheap and colors are totally different than photos.
1.0,"This is advertised as an ID bracelet, which is isn't.  It's a cute bracelet for a birthday gift bag, but it's definitely not an ID bracelet."
1.0,"This is a very nice looking bag. It is leather; however, I do not think it is lambskin, as stated in the description. The bag is very rigid; the flap is especially stiff and difficult to hold open. It's frustrating trying to get anything out of the bag. I definitely would Not recommend this bag to anyone."
1.0,Requested a return to small no response
1.0,Cheap material. Very thin. I am 5'5 and 160. I ordered the xl. The straps are loose. Hard to use restroom. Material came a part after one wash. A waste of
1.0,"Did everything needed - bought a sturdy base, kept it down unless we were using, etc and the main pole for the umbrella is bending. Totally not usable and now out of the return window.  Don't buy it."
1.0,The souls are put in incorrectly and have wrinkles in them that you can feel as soon as you put them on. It makes them very uncomfortable. I would not recommend.
1.0,Expected three pairs as listed.
1.0,Flimsy and much larger than they appear in picture. Avoid
1.0,Poorly made. They both broke the first day. Wast of money.
1.0,After arranging my new purse and putting my belongings in it I moved the purse off my table to the chair and the handle broke. I returned it for my money back. The product was also very very shiny and fake looking.
1.0,i have had to buy three because mine kept breaking DO NOT RECOMMEND
1.0,"Waste of money, not the ring in the picture, in fact it‚Äôs a picture from another company who actually sells what in the picture."
1.0,the charm was way to small pretty for a little girl but not for an adult
1.0,"Fresh out of the box the lights on neither shoe worked. Nothing happens when you plug them in to charge. It is not user error, I did trouble shooting. They're overpriced for the quality/make as well. Please note that the entire inside is furry which makes them hot with socks on. Would not buy again."
1.0,"Cheap, faded, poorly made, waste of money.  How did this get rated Amazon's Choice?"
1.0,"You can smell leather a mile away, this has a plastic smell. just got it and I haven't used it yet, but I'm certain this isn't worth the money I spent."
1.0,I want a refund arrive broken
1.0,This necklace is too big and bulky for kids!
1.0,"WAY too small in the waist, awful quality and they sent the incorrect color. Returned"
1.0,horrible looks nothing like the pic
1.0,stiff and way too small.
1.0,Did not fit at all despite my ordering it 2 sizes too big.
1.0,dress runs very small also way to short in the front
1.0,Se rompio la correa con solo 4 dias de uso
1.0,"I ordered a medium, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 130lbs. The waist is ridiculously tiny- like for my 10 year old tiny. Yes, it‚Äôs stretchy and I got them on, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt comfortable. AND, they were SO short! As in, my entire ankles and some of my shins are showing, kind of short. Who designed this?! Ironically, the butt fit great."
1.0,"A great idea, poorly executed. They hold the shirt tucked in until you move. Try to tie your show, and they snap loose;  it looks like black elastic bands are shooting out of your backside. Very amusing to those around you, but not what I wanted. Absolutely -- not -- what -- I -- wanted."
1.0,32 days and they broke. The company asked me to send back but that means I have to pay shipping. I payed $27.00 already and they are extremely cheaply made. The first day one of the lens popped out but I was able to pop it back in. Don‚Äôt waste your money on these.
1.0,One earring literally came without the part to go in your ear. The color is cheap looking and already slightly tarnished but I guess that‚Äôs expected for the price. But At Least make it possible to put the things on.
1.0,Im a 36DDD i got the large. The top fit around but way way to small cup size. The bottoms fit in waist area but not tight. The front coverage was good an butt ok. But after getting in the water i had to keep pulling the bottoms up on my hips and out of my crack.
1.0,This is a terrible unraveling mess after one wear. It started unraveling at the fringes before I even put it on my daughter. By the time we were at her photo shoot it was unraveling everywhere and her little hands were caught all in the mess of thread. I‚Äôm hoping it does not show in the photos. I would return but I passed the return date as I ordered it early for her photos. Cheap mess.
1.0,"I don't mind a snug fit, but this is just plain stupid small, dishonest small, we-sold--you-a-little-girl's-dress-and-charged-you-for-a women's-dress small, we-were-too-lazy-to-check-our-sizes-with-industry-standard-sizes-small, we-got-a-good-deal-on-a-half-yard-of-fabric-and-pretended-a-skinny-tube-with-a-hole-for-your-head-and-two-arms-is-a-dress-small, I'm-sorry-are-you-unable-to-breathe-in-this-tournequete-dress-why-are-you-turning-blue-small.  Don't buy it.  It's a striped trap."
1.0,Cheap and one side didn‚Äôt have a thread so it wouldn‚Äôt screw on. Came to me broken
1.0,Broke the first time I opened it - flew backwards and all the wires twisted. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,The product was being sold as Army green but it isn't army green or the green in the picture by far it's olive!!!! Buyers beware!!!!
1.0,The ring is of poor quality and it is not worth it.
1.0,"After three months of wearing these boots, both boots have a crack across the bottom that goes all the way up through the sole of the shoe.<br /><br />Aside from the lack of longevity, this is not something I recommend for construction. The composite toe is not sturdy. The center of the toe in both my boots has a dip in the composite toe that pops in and out. Not particularity comfortable. I wouldn't hike in these boots.<br />A+ for customer service. The size was a little small for me, and returning and buying a half size up was easy quick.<br />D for quality."
1.0,I ordered this for a trip but I did not receive it in time. I had multiple trips coming up the next few months so figured I could use it then. I did not even open the package. I really wished I had because the product did not hold up to packing for the trip. The material is very thin and the zipper felt flimsy. I added clothes to the largest cube then zipped it close. There was still room so I unzipped it to add another couple of items. The zipper broke off and I could not get it to work. It happened to the medium-sized one too. I am so annoyed I did not use it sooner because I can no longer return it.
1.0,"Don't waste your money as inexpensive as these are. The caps are cute enough but they stretch out after first wearing and can't really be worn again. Washing might snap them back to wearable condition, but having to wash after each wear isn't really inconvenient. Would not recommend."
1.0,This was not a well made watch. The plastic face was broken off before I even opened it
1.0,My husband purchased these earrings.  They did not appear to be new and were dirty.  Trying to return.
1.0,This hat looked like it had bleach spilled on it. Color quality was terrible.
1.0,huge and ugly. Can't wear them because they look like clown glasses. Wouldn't recommend these unless you want to look funny.
1.0,"I love all of the others I bought from this company... only this one was sewn improperly in the back along the elastic band..<br /><br /> Well, it has been a few weeks now and I have yet to hear from anyone at Amazon or the manufacturers about the problem with the terrible sewing at the back band... the elastic is twisted and sewn into the seam.... This totally mess' up the way the material lays in the back..."
1.0,Dress is supposed to have a loop on both sides of the chest area to hold the strings. My dress only has a loop on one side.
1.0,"I am returning this item. It‚Äôs way too large. I bought a M. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and athletic slim. I did not find a return form in the package, will be writing a note to them I guess."
1.0,"Really????  This women's XL free size is VERY misleading!!!  My 8 year old niece who is thin and trim was able to fit into the top perfectly.  The bottoms were baggy on her butt.  I am an XL American sized women and when held up to my chest, this top literally covered one boob and could barely stretch across to the other one.  The outfit it ADORABLE and will give it 10 stars for the look but the size is really rated about a Negative 10!!  So disappointed that this does not fit properly!<br /><br />This is not one of those jacked up companies that will not take your return back, so that is a Good Thing in returning the product with ease and no out of pocket money.  5 stars in customer service!!"
1.0,I ordered an xl. This is the first time I have had an Amazon clothing item run big.  The xl is equal to a plus size 3x.
1.0,"My gear fit2 has fallen off now twice in the last two days since I started using this. I was using this to replace ANOTHER replacement band I got from another seller. Neither of them stays on - the connectors let loose even if you are very careful to click them into place. The original one from Samsung can barely be removed, but these come loose on their own, resulting in an almost lost watch. :(  Thankfully I had a big winter coat on and the watch got caught in the cuff so I didn't lose it."
1.0,Same as a couple other customers. Maybe it works for smaller but not for D ladies at least. Just deformed them or buckled at the sides or wouldn‚Äôt fit in the right position. Not at all like picture.  I‚Äôd be better off with nothing honestly. Waste of money the search continues
1.0,Fake fake fake
1.0,Usually wear xl but ordered xxl. This is like a medium.
1.0,I did not receive this dress. They sent me a completely different dress. I will say the dress they sent is absolutely beautiful and very good quality and fit my daughter amazing. But it was a short dress and I needed the long dress for a photo shoot. She was also disappointed that the dress she wanted did not come.
1.0,"As you can see, the point is bent or glued on wrong. I tried to use it to see how it did and it was so off that it went to every side that the angle was pointing. It really ticks me off! The pictures when I bought it showed a pretty polished stone‚Ä¶..it is NOT! I think or hope my pictures show what it really looks like. It‚Äôs a shame and I feel ripped off! I do not recommend this item!"
1.0,This item did not come like described. It is very flat at the bottom and does not give the shape portray. I ordered a large and it is extremely small. I was not satisfied with this purchase.
1.0,"Didn‚Äôt like how it looked, my daughter was very disappointed with it."
1.0,"The graduation hat part of the keychain was completely broken off when received (the part that would attach it back to the keychain was broken, therefore impossible to re-attach)."
1.0,This shirt is so small it didn‚Äôt fit my young daughter. I ordered an XL according to the measurements. The description says it‚Äôs a loose fitting top. On who!?!
1.0,look very cheap.. low quality product.. but very easy installation..
1.0,"It came with the light button detached, without glue. Noticed immediately after taking it out of the box."
1.0,Tight. Pads move. Choose another set.
1.0,no way this is the size it states it is.
1.0,This dress cloth is very cheap! It's is not what is describe... my friend that wanted this dress for a special occasion was very VERY disappointed.
1.0,About a size smaller than I thought it‚Äôs be
1.0,Very thin see through fabric-thin t-shirt type material. Returned. If the fabric was better quality it might have been ok-I just couldn‚Äôt see myself trying even with a slip underneath. I bought the black in small.
1.0,To type with my legs in causes them to hurt
1.0,They are nice but the back piece that screws on is cheap plastic and broke right away. I had to superglue it cause i had no other plugs this size !
1.0,old gloves ...
1.0,"Did not work. Put it together, turned it on and it never produced steam. After 20 min it shut off. Complete waste of time and money. Stick with a name brand they work."
1.0,These items fell apart on first washing.  I have purchased these in the past and reordered them as I can't find these pajama bottoms in womens clothing.  I reordered a set I ordered last year and they fell apart on the first washing.  They are poorly constructed and do not merit purchase.
1.0,One of the clips is sewn on backwards so my relative can not wear them. Waiting to get them back so I can return them.
1.0,Came a total different color and style than picture
1.0,The length of the 2 straps were completely different. So one Hung down ridiculously low. Not even worth $1
1.0,"I bought this sneakers for my son and after 1 month of use they look awful, absolutely worn out. Definitely not what you expect from $92 boots.<br />We used to love Geox, so I don‚Äôt know what happened with the Geox quality."
1.0,Beautiful dress but had some faults. It‚Äôs light weight and very comfortable but mine came ripped. Poor sewing seen as the white thread is easily visible.
1.0,It was for someone else for Christmas.
1.0,"Also fabric was like parachute, not cotton."
1.0,Looks very very cheap it is like a swim suit material not cute or sexy I would not recommend buying it also has ripped after just trying it on
1.0,"See update at bottom! First off, I'm a real consumer and received nothing for my review. Nice pants, bought to wear in Mexico for dinners etc. Comfortable, light weight, decent fit. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the are a little long to wear with flip flops. Probably could have hemmed a couple inches off and they'd be perfect.<br /><br />*update Will never buy again. No care instruction on tag. Since I wore them in Mexico where it was hot and humid had some sweat marks. Washed with all my whites including other linen cloths, used bleach in the bleach dispenser and there are now holes in them like the bleach ate the fabric. I washed cold and tumble dried low just like all my other linen cloths called for. See pics. This was the first wash."
1.0,"Cool design, grew up on the old jd soundguard tractors. Pin was snapped off when I opened the package so couldn't even use it."
1.0,"Not really sure what I expected from buying such cheap jewelry online... but I generally trust Amazon and thought this would be worth a try. I was wrong. In less than a year, I‚Äôve cycled through each piece (only need one at a time) and they have all broken in one way or another. I was most exciting about the angel wings, and they broken the soonest. Not worth it, very disappointed in the poor quality of this jewelry. I wish I hadn‚Äôt spent the money on it."
1.0,It‚Äôs very itchy.
1.0,This broke after one use. Very disappointing and has to return.
1.0,"Cheap finish. Material looks cheap. Sadly I can not return it sense I already worn them. Sizing is small, not accurate."
1.0,Did not see there was a confederate flag on it until it arrived. I just threw it away
1.0,These broke apart fairly quickly.  Not something that will last very long.
1.0,"La blusa est√° bi√©n para el precio,  le doy una estrella porque me enviaron una blusa usada, con mal olor horrible a sudor y desodorante y mal olor en las axilas. NO la devuelvo porque me saldr√≠a muy costoso, pero realmente es una falta de respeto para el cliente, no creo que vuelva a comprar en esta tienda."
1.0,"The material and overall look of this item is cheaper in person than it looks in the photos, more costume material than beach cover up"
1.0,"I received this and at first they were great. Then after about a week my tongue was in a lot of pain and a lump formed. I pulled it out once I couldn‚Äôt eat, drink or even move my tongue without pain. I gave them to my sister; after she used them a week the same thing happened to her. The quality of bar &/or balls is poor. Had to repierce my tongue again after lump rescinded."
1.0,runs very small!!!
1.0,I wont buy anything from this place again.  Sizes are so small. Was at least 5 sizes too small
1.0,Nt happy as yr corduroy product has No Give- is inflexible. Shld nt hav the category pajama jeans...can hardly sit down in them!<br /><br />so happy wit yr new fabric in white and all the spring colours. Couldn't imagine any of yr products wld b a disappointment!! Lydia Bach

1.0,way bigger then described. be aware!
1.0,"It won't let me attach the photo but the skirt came with a stain on it and I missed the return period which sucks. Otherwise it was pretty much what it looks like, cheap material though."
1.0,One of the prongs broke and this was seldom worn
1.0,"The quality is worst than expected, won't recommend to anyone. Scam site, made in China. The hood looks crapy on head that's why no one is wearing it in there picture."
1.0,Threads stripped the first time my gf put them on
1.0,"Way too small, measurements weren‚Äôt correct."
1.0,"Theyre really small, the stone that screws to the piercing broke really easy."
1.0,Looks like a nightgown
1.0,"The quality was excellent, the FIT was too small, as though the model was a very short, tiny model"
1.0,Way too big<br />Would not fit most nose piercings
1.0,"I knew they were cheap.look it in the picture but I said well it comes fast so it was my only option.they are to hard to bend even closed..imagine open.its not possible.They broke all but one and we just got it yesterday..a couple broke yesterday ,then today, really anytime you touch it,.and they are like in the picture,, so you have some with no pairs and im clueless what you can ;kind of do with one earring..I just really didn't want you all to waste your money because I think 50 cents jewelry or home made stuff would last longer than this..It wouldn't even make it the day I needed..osi tried to use it broken and the medal is then and to sharp making that not really possible."
1.0,button fell off before i ever used it
1.0,"What they don't show in the photo is that the pleats flare out a lot when you put them on. Also, unless your figure has zero fat on it, this skort will show any extra weight you carry no matter how little."
1.0,"did not like the print, fabric"
1.0,"Wore it 4 times and the support rib poked me through through the seam. It's happened just after 1 month, but hopefully the company will exchange it for another or give a refund."
1.0,Broke as I was putting it on. Never even wore it.
1.0,Do not order. Only got jelly and would not overnight a peanut butter
1.0,Very poor quality and construction.
1.0,"Love the glasses and lens colour, fit too.<br /><br />What I don't love......that they were clearly a customer return, both lenses are cracked in several places and the box had been re-taped to seal it back up.<br />If you are going to ship 2nd hand product Amazon......you should state so.<br /><br />No direct Contact link to the seller either, so I can't even ask for a replacement.<br /><br />Not impressed that this practice goes on, if you pay for new items......that is what you should receive!!"
1.0,I wear a size medium in these bras. These bras need to say that they fit one size smaller than you need. DONT BUY THE SIZE YOU NEED BUY BIGGER!
1.0,These things fit super small
1.0,"These shirts are not moisture wicking, they‚Äôre not breathable, they have very irritating material and they will cause breakouts if you have sensitive skin."
1.0,"Updated review‚Ä¶<br />I‚Äôve demoted this review down to only a 1-Star rating because on the second day of wearing this watch band the floral design has already started to PEEL OFF!  I‚Äôm guessing the rest of the floral design will not last much longer now that it has started to peel off the silicone band. This is really sad that the quality of the floral design application is so poor that it didn‚Äôt last one full day. Don‚Äôt waste your money on a watch band whose design doesn‚Äôt last more than one day.<br />///<br />I love the floral pattern on this watch band! Too bad the band is made for a person with a huge wrist. When I removed it from the package and compared it to my old Apple Watch band (in the photos my old watchband is pink) I noticed how much longer this band was. It‚Äôs an inch longer. That might not sound like much but when you have a slim wrist it‚Äôs a lot of extra band length that has to wrap around your wrist.<br /><br />My wrist circumference is only 5 3/4‚Äù. When I put on my Apple watch with this floral band I have to use the smallest opening/hole to secure the watch in place. Then the excess band length has to be tucked into the slot and pushed underneath the main part of the band, with the excess wrapping around my wrist. The band is so long that it passes from the back of my wrist to the front/top of my wrist AND still extends under the actual watch for about 1/2‚Äù.  A watch band shouldn‚Äôt be this long for a good fit.<br /><br />Given the floral design of this watch, I‚Äôd guess that most people who wear this band will be women, who have smaller wrists than men. This watch band is likely to be very long for most women and they may want/need to cut off the excess length to have it fit better, or choose to wear the band looser like a bracelet.<br /><br />I‚Äôll probably eventually cut off an inch of the band at the end, but I‚Äôm worried that it might damage the floral pattern on the rest of the band (possibly causing the pattern to peel off where it gets cut.) I‚Äôll wear this band as-is for a while and see how it feels. If I do end up cutting off some excess length, I‚Äôll update this review.<br /><br />If you have a wrist circumference that is 6 1/4‚Äù or greater, this band will probably fit you pretty well. But for those with a small wrist like myself, you may not like having the excess band length to deal with. But the floral pattern looks adorable and the silicone band is very comfortable, so you may decide it‚Äôs worth dealing with the excess band length, which is what I‚Äôm going to do. (Knocking the rating down to 4-stars due to the excess length.)"
1.0,The band is junk. Color bleeds fades. It broke after a week. The pin came out of the band and wouldn‚Äôt attach to the watch. The print is blurry.
1.0,Does not stay in place. Constantly rolling up.
1.0,it was too big bought a medium and I'm 145 lbs 5 foot tall and I didn't realize it wasn't cotton. Not my favorite fabric for this type of dress. Pass
1.0,"The XL that I ordered could not go over my head.<br />Runs really, really small. The material was also inferior."
1.0,"What happened? The sewing machine must have run out of thread or the bobbin did, because the garment was unfinished. I love the Pam Grier look so I will try again. As for size, I went by my hip measurement and went with an XL. It was huge. I am a medium and will retry this one. Hopefully it will be a completed product. As a designer, I only purchase when it is most economical to do so. Here I go...again."
1.0,Small very
1.0,Threads ripped as soon as I put them on for the first time.
1.0,"Edit; reduced to 1 star because the stone fell out less than a year after I received the ring. I only wore it about one a week.<br />I like the ring. I wear it frequently, however, the cutting of the stone was done without skill. You can see the lines through the stone easily. It is still very pretty and sized properly."
1.0,"I am an optical engineer. I bought these because I thought that the concept was interesting.  I use a diopter rating in the center of the published range for these glasses. There is no setting on these glasses in which I can obtain a proper focus. By proper focus, I mean a clarity equivalent to that which I would find on a pair of $15 budget, reading glasses. Also there is no way to remove dust from between the two lenses. These were badly designed, badly manufactured, and a complete waste of time.  The cobalt blue color of the sides of the frames is kind of fun. That's about it. I did not even bother to return them. They went out with the trash."
1.0,"This dress has a very odd fit. It gapes at the chest, bunches at the waist, and is generally just not at all flattering."
1.0,Not very large or floppy
1.0,Get a size three times larger if you want them to fit.
1.0,This shirt is super short! If you have bigger breasts.. this won‚Äôt fit well over them!<br />Wish I did but barely covered my chest and I got a large. I‚Äôm a 36 DDD
1.0,This belt was not worth the money. The outer layer started to separate within a month and showed a red under surface which made the belt unusable. Would not order again.
1.0,"Poorly made . Too small, too doesn‚Äôt fit at all."
1.0,Broke within three months
1.0,I wish i had took a picture before i returned it but this was definitely not the item i paid for it was a completely different color looked huge like a blanket and was just ugly
1.0,"Extremely cheap fabric that was delivered frayed, the fit is small and oddly fitting."
1.0,The image is syc low quality. It is pixelated and looks as if it was just a lower quality thumbnail that was enlarged then put on the shirt. It's a shame because it looks very cute. But not nearly the quality in real life that it is in the image. My roommate told me it looked like I was &#34;still loading&#34;.
1.0,Material is very thin and the hood is twice as small as it should be. It‚Äôs not long enough to go over my head.
1.0,"Junk, broke in 2 days"
1.0,Took a long time to arrive and fell apart the &#34;glow in the dark&#34; center is just an odd shaped ball of who knows what I refused to even touch it. The hinge doesn't hold at all and the chain is very weak.
1.0,3x was Way way way too small. This is not US sizing.
1.0,The socks were too tight to pull up over the heel (women's shoe size 7). Could not wear them.
1.0,"It‚Äôs a nice fob, but it fell apart within a weeks time."
1.0,"The product I recieved is not the product the model is wearing, at all. The shape is not the same, nor the material. The slit on the side is not nearly as high. The dress shown is a completely different dress."
1.0,This suit was tiny!  It runs much smaller than typical suits!  I am unable to wear it!
1.0,I‚Äôm super upset because the clasps on these are similar to flimsy ones from the 80‚Äôs and they do not stay on your ear. I wore them for less than half an hour before I realized one fell off my ear! They‚Äôre super cute and everything but what‚Äôs the point if they don‚Äôt stay on your ear?? Mine is forever lost because I went walking outside when it fell off. I‚Äôm pretty upset and wish I would‚Äôve known the clasp was so flimsy and cheap.
1.0,This was like cheap costume material. Fit was super baggy and weird. Absolutely terrible!
1.0,"This bathing suit has proportions that aren‚Äôt even. The suit is too large yet the bust (molded cups) is way too small.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù, 220 lbs and wear between 16-18, or L, XL. I ordered a size 20, as usually bathing suits run one the small size. Very saggy in the bottom, tightening only affected sides not how bottom fit. Would not recommend. Pretty color though. Will be returning."
1.0,I'm super disappointed. This was such a pretty anklet and it broke within an hour of putting it on. Not worth it at all!
1.0,This necklace tangles very easily and is almost impossible to straighten out.  I don't recommend it
1.0,"I wanted to love this band, I really did. It looks fantastic, easy to put on and adjust. But, when it arrived, I noticed that the black and gold were both painted on very poorly, to the point there were parts visible that showed no black or gold. Within just a few weeks, the paint really started to come off, showing just how cheaply this band was made. And I've been out on leave from work because of surgery, so it's not like the band was being abused in any way, for the most part I couldn't leave my bed or chair. For nearly $30, I expected a lot better quality than what I got, I honestly feel ripped off. I wouldn't waste your money on this band, look elsewhere and get something of better quality for your money."
1.0,I have 2 pair of these pants in black. I love them. The grey ones are a completely different fabric - thin and shiny. Returned them.
1.0,They did not fit my watch
1.0,With the first wash there was a tear. It appears the fabric is thin...you can see sunlight through it. I wouldn't recommend this product.
1.0,Loved it until I tried it on and found the cut to be awkward on me. The sunflower billowed out weird and was to high up from my waist. Nice fabric though. Bummed it didnt fit me properly.
1.0,"The rings are very small. For a young child, perhaps. Plus, they are cheap. They turned my daughter's fingers green."
1.0,Comfort softness and stretch is great seeing sucks
1.0,This was way too small definitely buy the largest size. What a waste of money
1.0,broken after open the box.
1.0,"Not true surgical steel, they crack when you stretch them open and caused an allergic reaction with both my piercings in my nose and ear."
1.0,Horrible... it does not work and cannot be returned... do not waste your money.
1.0,"super cute,  kids love them but buy them at walmart!"
1.0,The quality is no good. Cheap.
1.0,My grand daughter says her hands slip on the monkey bars and she doesn't want to use them.
1.0,Returned this. It was WAY to small. Barely plus size at all.
1.0,Bought a 2x for my husband and they fit more like a large. They were way smaller than the size listed. I would order up!
1.0,It had started spelling off. I never wore it. Looks very cheap. It's in my junk drawer.
1.0,Didn't meet my expectations non of my orders does horrible
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy this shirt. I ordered a medium which usually I am a small and can‚Äôt even get it over my shoulders and the arms are for a teenager.
1.0,"Beware.  This was ordered in women‚Äôs XL, and the garment was too small to even try on.  At 5‚Äô3 and 155 lbs I normally wear an XL.  Do not recommend."
1.0,"Unless you're one size all over, not everything will fit. I'm a L in tops but an XL in bottoms. So the top was a little too big and the bottom was way too small. If you aren't one size for both top and bottom this probably won't fit. The material feels nice but if it stretches too much will be sheer."
1.0,Very cheaply made and arrived broken
1.0,"Boots looked nothing like picture: color, heel etc"
1.0,"Not cute at all. And when I bent over, the zipper made me look pregnant."
1.0,"I loved this band, but it broke when I took it off tonite, just 4 days after the return window closed. So disappointing."
1.0,Don‚Äôt support comunism. Don‚Äôt buy these shirts.
1.0,This product is extremely small.  I ordered my usual size and I could not get the top or bottom on!
1.0,Ripped the first time I used it. Just awful!
1.0,Get one size above what you actually wear
1.0,Immediately tarnished poor quality
1.0,Broke immediately and even after I fix one area another breaks.
1.0,"These overalls either have severe dry rot or are made out of paper. The bottom of the pocket was incorrectly sewn to the leg seam of the pant so right off the bat the fit was weird and because of that error, the overalls tore in three places as soon as I sat down for the first time. They would tear if I looked at them funny the material was so weak. Don‚Äôt waste your money"
1.0,This just didn't work. Im not sure if the one I received was dried out but it just didn't shine silver at all. I have tried it on both silver (90% silver) and sterling silver (92.5% silver).
1.0,"Too too small, plussize sizing way off."
1.0,I bought this for my husband but he only had it on his keychain for a couple of days (less than a week) before the keychain broke. Cute idea but cheap.
1.0,The item was very small for an XXL. This size arrived looking as a size small. The item also arrived in the wrong color.
1.0,further stained my shoe. The only difference i see is now i have a bigger stain on my shoe due to this product.
1.0,I was waiting at the door when it came because I was going to a party and excited for something new. I was running late and it turned out that there was about four stones missing ... they were in the bag but I would‚Äôve had to stop and figure out how to put them back in with glue and all that. So I wasn‚Äôt too happy with it and the fact that it was very flimsy.
1.0,The description says ‚Äúengraved‚Äù this is just a printed sticker put onto and acrylic piece. I do not see it lasting very long as a key chain. It didn‚Äôt even come with the silver parts to be able to hang it. Do not recommend.
1.0,"The shirt was labeled XL, but it fit like a small. It was a birthday gift to someone and and such a waste of my money. I am returning it, but now have no gift, so thanks for that humiliation."
1.0,This shirt was not advertised having red stripes in it  looks nothing like the picture shown
1.0,These did not fit my Fitbit Versa.
1.0,Cheap glasses
1.0,"Waaaaaaaaaay too small, even after ordering up in size.  Also, I didn't realize the material was going to be like a dri-fit tshirt.."
1.0,There is NOTHING about this product that is compression. Plain nylon mesh tank top. Nothing special about it. Buy another product.
1.0,Does not float. It will not even keep keys floating much less my phone (which I purchased it for) I am returning.
1.0,took over a month to receive.  Product sucks.  doesnt charge effectively
1.0,When I bought it I loved it but 8 months later something inside broke free and it keeps the day and date but the time function does nothing.<br />I paid $98 for it with a complete watch repair kit. Trashed today because it cost more to fix than I paid!
1.0,The chain is super cheap looking.
1.0,It turn green after 2 weeks
1.0,This is a knock-off.  The real Nike shirt is buttery soft.  This is so scratchy I can't wear it.  It is thin to the point of being almost see-through (even in dark blue).  Waste of money.
1.0,I've used similar products in the past with good results. For some reason these will not stick to the lens.
1.0,Came in two different knots !!!!  Not happy.
1.0,This product is not silver at all or antique silver. I got 50 pieces of bronze martini charms. Do not buy picture doesn't look like what you will get.
1.0,"This ""face"" is so distorted it's like a stretched balloon.. I ripped off the bordering to use on some other mask. Looks not funny, not like a face."
1.0,Poor quality for price
1.0,"This mask does not fit properly as it is too narrow and the earpieces are too long, it does not go all the way to the chin so it keeps sliding. The design is also not big as in the photo."
1.0,"Product is not bad, just too small for an adult."
1.0,Great idea. Turned finger green immediately. Also ring pinches your finger due to its ability to make bigger and smaller
1.0,The tassels are so super short  and you must have am very small waist. I am a medium and couldn't get it around my waist. I am returning it
1.0,Went to try it on my son and the Nike swoosh started to peal. May just be a defected item but definitely not worth the money. Will be returning.
1.0,Absolutely terrible. Completely see through. No liner. Cheaply made. Returning ASAP. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,It is very smart
1.0,"Two sets of these silver hoops have broken, both within a 4 month period. Just fell out of my ear in peices. Beautiful,  but poorly made.  I'm so disappointed."
1.0,The fabric at about the unicorn's hip was not connected so it could not be fully inflated.:( Disappointed kiddo.
1.0,Bought these to wear to a Jimmy Buffett concert. I ended up not wearing them. They felt too plastic and cheap. I though they were of better quality when I looked at pictures. These are more for kids.
1.0,One of the worst purchased i've ever made. It is nothing as described. You have to put it together and it is most definitely not one size fits all. Do not buy this item unless you have seen it in person.
1.0,the bone fell off. i used this as a key chain memorial for my puppy that passed away. the bone became detached :(
1.0,Item did not fit over the regular glasses.
1.0,"Nothing like the 1st one I got ,missing the yellow symbol on the ball plus broken."
1.0,This cheap after market band would not snap into place and kept falling off my arm!
1.0,This hat is NOT built for women or kids (or even adults with normal size heads). It is gigantic and very cheaply made.
1.0,Don't stick well tried multiple times always fall off after a couple days.
1.0,The ring is ok but it turned my finger green.  Kind of disappointed.
1.0,"After just 4 months, every pair has holes, some are in tatters.  Bought these to replace another brand that I've had going on 4+ years---some of these are in better condition than these more recently purchased.  Will not make this mistake again."
1.0,"I was hoping to find a long double strand of pearls and thought that's what I had found with this.  However, what I received was two separate very long strands of pearls."
1.0,"I ordered the size that Amazon suggested for my wife, and it was too small. Went to return it and found that the process is not easy.  I am waiting for a label from Gobi so that I can return the vest.  Very clunky process."
1.0,"Loved it when I got it, basically came unbraided within a week. Can't wear it"
1.0,"I wanted a cheap pair of comfy slippers for around the house.. ordered these for $18‚Ä¶<br />The fuzz was only on the outside and the bottom was lumpy cardboard<br />Absolutely awful and very upset, quality is disgraceful. Shame on you for allowing these for sale."
1.0,There is a hole in the fabric. I am trying to return it for a full credit
1.0,The wand didn't work. I checked the batteries to make sure they were installed according to the diagram too. It still doesn't work.
1.0,"Very cheap, thin material. Will not wear"
1.0,The hat had been worn before and I assumed returned.. it had been steamed into a cowboy hat shape rather than as a flat brimed hat...<br />Tried to return to its original shape but failed..<br />Sucks that it was a return and resold...<br />would not trust the supplier
1.0,Did not like the material or smell
1.0,If you have any cellulite these will<br />Show it all.
1.0,Initially they were the best underwear I've put on... After one wash and dryer they were completely ruined.. Fabric is cheap and care instructions apparently should say do not put them into the dryer... Had to throw them all away
1.0,Top bra & underwire is not sown to the actual tank so the material bunches on the sides & in the middle. Weird fitting top I will be returning as it‚Äôs not wearable.
1.0,"Cheaply made, to small, and over priced!"
1.0,Can't pry them open to actually wear them.
1.0,Headband broke on first try
1.0,Quality of the fabric isn't hat good.
1.0,"The bone charm fell off the first day the dog wore it.  He's a small, old dog. he doesn't run around or get rough. He went out to relieve himself and I noticed a while later it was gone.  Can't find it. Very disappointed. It was cute."
1.0,Took long time to come and broke in a day we used super glue to fix
1.0,"Sizes are not traditional US sizes. I keep encountering these cheaply made garments from overseas that run EXTREMELY small. For example, a 6X is the equivalent of a 1X in the United States. No exaggeration."
1.0,These pants are cheaply made<br />Where the pants are sewed has holes after wearing first time
1.0,"The product was a joke! Bought as a stocking, it was smaller than a child's sock, and twisted all up."
1.0,"I have been Meilun fashions for three years. This is first negative review of their product that I have had to write. First the packaging was off.. usually Meilun clothing comes in a Meilun brand zip lick closure bag. This did not.<br /><br />Meilun has in the past been high quality bandage material, but the skirt I just received was of light weight material and was very large for a size small. In comparison to all of my other clothing by Meilun this product by far did not live up to the quality that I am accustomed to. Hoping that this is not the new normal for the Meilun brand."
1.0,"Like others have experienced, the fringe frayed with the first wear. I trimmed all of those loose strands but it happened again with the 2nd wear, and again with the 3rd. I guess I will cut off all of the fringe and if that doesn't work, throw it away."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:af7531a87f85b22283e96f70139e62b0]] It doesn‚Äôt lock , so it falls down . Don‚Äôt have time to be returning bad products ? Do not buy it !"
1.0,I only got a top when it's suppose to be a romper a full suit and I needed it for October 13 I'm not paying 23 dollars for one top when it's supposed to be a romper I'm so upset
1.0,After reading the reviews and knocking this was an Asian size I ordered a size larger and still couldn't get them over my hips. They were more like 3 sizes too small which is too bad because I love the jeans. They asked if I'd settle for a partial refund and Jeep the jeans because shipping back to China would cost more than the jeans. I knew I shouldn't have ordered them from China but did anyway. Lesson learned.
1.0,"Tooo big, cheap material"
1.0,"The end of the shoe lace broke on the 2nd day. In addition, the shoe laces are way to tight to get the shoe on without major struggle. I would not recommend this product to those looking for an easy fix to tying shoe laces. You‚Äôll have more issues putting the shoes on."
1.0,Never purchase this item. Total crap. Worst purchase ever.
1.0,Did not fit as described
1.0,Cheap as heck....
1.0,"If by xtra large you were referring to a toddler, then ok.  But not for this girl.  5'6&#34; 150 lbs size 36C/D depending on top.  This did not even come close to covering any part of me.  Not even worth returning for how cheap it was.  I will see if I can pass it off to someone who is a size 2."
1.0,First set broke a few blocks from the house the first time wearing them. Returned and ordered another. Second broke putting them on. Won't order another.
1.0,Washed it the first time (cold water) and the heart went from jet black to the dullest grey on earth.
1.0,Cheap material can see through it.
1.0,"Falling apart without wearing it, nose came off as soon as I open it, and then the ears one by one"
1.0,Broke after wearing first day
1.0,Way too short and small
1.0,"When I went to wear the earring for the 4th of July, I noticed that one was significantly shorter than the other.  By about an inch!  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
1.0,"Ill fitting, Shiny polyester and very transparent."
1.0,I took measurements against the chart to makesure I was ordering the right size. I even ordered up 1 size. What i got was at least 3 sizes to small.
1.0,The hourglass part in the middle dumps sand from one side to the other because the opening is so wide. I thought it was a defect so I ordered another one but had the same issue. Just crappy production.
1.0,Please don‚Äôt waste your money!
1.0,I did not like the material at all.  Very poor quality in my opinion.  The length was shorter than pictured and it hung like a sack.  The only way to obtain any shaping is with the strip of matching cloth (belt?) provided.  Returned it immediately.
1.0,"Complete garbage. I ordered the 16g 8mm ring and it took me forever to open it and once I opened it, it wouldn't close. Don't waste your money. I sure wish I didn't. I wish I could get a refund because it was absolute sh*t."
1.0,"Cute, but not the best quality. Broke one the 3rd day of use."
1.0,"Piece of garbage without any instructions for the parts. Yes, I can see there are holes which the filters go into, but even when trying them both ways it still doesn‚Äôt work and no clue how to correct it. Made in China..."
1.0,The length did not sit right. Wanted to return same day could not find option to return. Very disappointed
1.0,Not true to size at all ordered woman's xxl. Looks like girls mediumits thin and short not like the pic at all. In the pic hanged to girls thigh. What I got probably at waist on a normal person.dont buy it
1.0,Poor quality. Looks cheap. Had stains on it and thread runs. Returned it.
1.0,Not iridescent.... it‚Äôs tie dyed super sad
1.0,I liked the feel of the bra but wasn't my size at all. Smaller than truly is.
1.0,"Not true to size I got a large in which I normally wear large shirts. Couldn't get it passed my sides. My 13 yr old was able fit it well she's a size 3....poorly made after 2 wears the seam at the zipper started coming a lose. Doesn't stay in place so not sure how it supposed to trim the waist, rides up to my burst. Yes its cheap but also a waste of money for anyone who has a little weight on them. Spend the money for a better one."
1.0,Looked like the material used for a Halloween costume! Awful!!
1.0,looks like the puffy pirate shirt from Seinfeld.  Tacky and cheap looking. returned.
1.0,"They are very pretty but SO heavy I had to take them off after 30 min and my earring holes were huge and green, very sore and caused a scab to form overnight.  If very heavy earrings don‚Äôt bother you then by all means they look great. I don‚Äôt have sensitive ears or need to have gold or silver posts and can wear some large earrings with no issue. Not these. I don‚Äôt recommend"
1.0,"This dress looks great on the models. But it‚Äôs paper thin and the farthest from true to size! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1, DD cup with a few extra pounds. I ordered the extra large and when I put it on, it barely covered my breasts. It fit like a small or medium would. It‚Äôs extremely disappointing."
1.0,"Size is incredibly small. My 3 yr old can still fit into 2t and these underwear are for newborn children or teddy bears. I am not sure, waste of money. don't order."
1.0,It broke the first time my daughter wore it. It is really cute but the quality is poor.
1.0,It is not possible to return item from Miami. Watch NEVER worked. Thank to Amazon I got refund and still have the watch at home if they ever want it back.
1.0,"If I could give zero I would. It was enormous! Like a joke,enormous. Please don't buy and if you do go 2 sizes down at least lol"
1.0,Cute but the back didn't stay on
1.0,Bra was not the correct size as advertised.
1.0,Love the gnomes on the front but this shirt is not like the sweatshirts that we all know and love.  The material is shiny and not stretchy at all.  Definitely not sized correctly-I usually wear xl (who doesn‚Äôt love a roomy sweatshirt) but followed suggestions and went up to xxl.  Still too small.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"I really liked how they looked, but one of the backs broke off the second time I tried to put them on. I tried to bend the it as little as possible to get them on, but the material must be really cheap. Unfortunately, the return window had already closed by the time this happened, but I would still like to return them. I won't ever buy from Humble Chic again, total waste of money."
1.0,Bag is a replica don't buy
1.0,I didn‚Äôt not like these tank tops at all. They were way to small. I had to give this a one star rating but I didn‚Äôt want to give it any at all. They don not fit as expected like it was stated. I‚Äôm very disappointed
1.0,If you are attempting to purchase a Big Kids 6.5 boot the site will allow you to select this size but you will receive a toddler boot.
1.0,"Very pretty, unfortunately it looked as though it had been broken and glued."
1.0,The clasp would not stay closed for more than a few minutes whenever I put the watch on.
1.0,Ran small to size
1.0,"The size is misleading.. the ID slot does not fit a standard sized ID, it just slides around left and right, never staying centered. Super annoying and sits in a drawer now."
1.0,Won‚Äôt stay on !
1.0,"First band was great and still holding, the second band will not stay closed. I looked at it and the clasp isn't lining up and lets go at the slightest amount of pressure."
1.0,Terrible image that barely looks like what the photos look like.  I feel ripped off.  Don't spend money on this.
1.0,Not a fan of these. I bought then for my 3yo son and they are flimsy. The ear strings are thin. I wouldn't buy them again.
1.0,This top was such a disappointment. It's super cute in the picture not super cute in person. In the picture it looks way longer than it really is. I'm only 5 foot 3 and it came to the top of my jeans. The material looks more like jean in the picture and it's not. I did like the neck but the rest is horribly cut and bells out. I have already sent it back.
1.0,The color of the item received is not the light pink in the photo. It‚Äôs a magenta - a deep purple pink. The rating is a reflection of the misrepresentation in advertising and delivery of the wrong item.
1.0,This is not the wrong item.<br />This is a defective item.  The lights do not work on this item.<br />Will I get a refund?
1.0,Junk. Very low quality! Looked like they melted the cord all the way through. Very poorly wound.
1.0,I‚Äôm sorry I wasted my money on this. It is very poor quality. I‚Äôve only worn this twice and it‚Äôs already pilling in the front as evidenced by the photos and also in the armpit area. Really disappointing.
1.0,I am 5 ft 7 and this had such a short torso there was no blousing and a front to bag wedgie
1.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 150lbs and ordered a 40. I have other swimsuits that I use for lap swimming that are all 40s, this bathing suit was WAY too small. Fit around my butt but then didn‚Äôt come up high enough to even cover my nipples. This is with the straps as long as they can go. Will be returning it."
1.0,THEY THINK WE ARE ALL THE SAME SIZE AS ASIANS!!!<br /><br />Do not order these jeans if you are even a size XL. I am normally a size 1x or 2x but I just had a c-section so I went with a 3x  for the extra room ...it did not even fit past my thighs. My daughter who is a size small tried them on and they were right on her.
1.0,False advertisement not a great toy for chewing like I said did not stand a chance with my eight month old boxer
1.0,If you‚Äôre gonna sell a product make sure the picture matches the product
1.0,I WAS INSTRUCTED BY A FRIEND OF MINE SAID THESE JUST WERE NOT WORTH.
1.0,Product Doesn't match the photo
1.0,"I would not recommend this necklace. I only wore it for 2 days then it broke and when I tried to return it, they wouldn't let me.  I only bought this necklace 2 weeks ago. I am super disappointed with this product. It's pretty much a waste of money."
1.0,Frames break unexpectedly without any rhyme or reason.
1.0,Ordered adult hats for a reason. Definitely didn't fit.  Perfectly fit my toddler. Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheap piece of Chinese crap
1.0,"They are very thin and see through. They kinda look like spanks ... very odd for ""supposidly"" being Bike Shorts"
1.0,Broken zipper. Returned for refund.
1.0,"EXTREMELY SHORT! I'm 5'2&#34; 115lbs and a medium (in white) probably went about a generous inch below my butt cheeks. Not to mention, the back was about an inch shorter than the front. I can't imagine this would fit on anyone taller than 5 foot.<br />I measured the back and it was only 12 inches! I think the description said it was something like 14, which it definitely is not."
1.0,Absolute garbage. The material was terrible and after wearing them one day they ripped by sitting down. I do not recommend
1.0,"Had to send these back.  Very cute shoe, but I received a size right shoe 8 and left shoe 8.5.  Neither of which fit as expected.  They were both too small and narrow."
1.0,"I just received my sunglasses and there are no nose pads on them like the pictures. It was like they were just removed. You can see the notches on the inside where they should go, but they are not there. I‚Äôll be returning, but would like a pair that is complete. I can‚Äôt wear these! Very upset!"
1.0,"This mask was supposed to be new with its own new filter. Instead of getting what I paid for, I got a mask neatly folded back into the packet, the filter was already inside of the mask which was weird. When I removed the filter to wash the mask, it had clearly been used prior to my purchase of it. Thats nasty."
1.0,"See through, and too small"
1.0,Ca not get these watches set.üòë
1.0,Looked aweful!
1.0,THESES ERRINGS LOOK LIKE SOMETHING FOR A BABYS EAR MAY GIVE THEM TI MY GRANDKIDS ARE SEND THEM BACK AND THEY ARE VERY SMALL.
1.0,Very pretty and fit well but didn‚Äôt like the feel of material used
1.0,Did not fit my helix bought for nothing
1.0,very comfortable at first but it only took a month  to become very uncomfortable and these boots do not breath at all either. feet will be very wet at the end of the day even in the cooler months. would buy rock roosters next time. also after less than 4 months the soles started to fall apart very poor quaility
1.0,Terrible. The watch came with no battery. It was a gift to a friend. I was so embarrassed!!! It's so aggravating...
1.0,I ordered xl because I have a big bust and even with xl I looked like a busted can of Pillsbury biscuits.
1.0,They do not keep my feet dry if water happens to overflow my boots
1.0,"I ordered two different ones of these but only two of the same ones arrived. I opened one up (the one with crystals) and give of the ""gems"" already popped off as I was removing it from the wrapping. Cool idea but very cheaply made."
1.0,I wore these for 2 days before the bottom started to fall apart.  I would not recommend these at all! Horrible quality.
1.0,NOT AT ALL AS DESCRIBED!! MUCH SMALLER. I‚Äôm including a photo to prove it. SO DISAPPOINTED IN MY PURCHASE AND IN AMAZON FOR NOT SCREENING VENDORS BETTER. This was a Prime item and was shipped by Amazon.
1.0,Would not recommend this for purchase.  The art work on the front looks like it was done by a child and clothes quality is poor. First wash most  of the front gone
1.0,I was expecting color was a little righter than brown. Cream or beige would be much better.
1.0,"Very disappointed with the sizing, since my pair seems about 2 sizes smaller than expected.  There's no sizing chart on the page, there's little to no stretch in the fabric."
1.0,"I had to modify it to wear it, I cut it because the head didn't for right. It looked great for photos only. It was too hot and I had to take it off within 30 minutes."
1.0,"Really small. The x-large didn't even fit my 12 year old daughter who wears a women's extra-small. The cloth is very shiny polyester, the color part on the top hit me halfway down my breasts, and the whole thing smelled like cigarette smoke. I sent it back."
1.0,"The clothes came badly folded which immediately proved to be a clothes already tried before and when dressing I identified 2 big holes in the dress. If necessary I can send photos. Item has certainly been used before. Very disappointed, was a waste of my time and my money."
1.0,"My kids grandfather passed away, and we got one of these so they could keep his ashes close by to remember him. Less that a week after filling it up and shipping ashes off to be interned in the military cemetery, the top breaks off and the hourglass drops off and the ashes fall out and blow away! The crappy solder job used to hold the top to the three wires all broke. there is one miniscule little dot on the wires.<br />Choose something sturdier than this if you want to keep the ashes safe at all!!!"
1.0,"Legit it was a an early Christmas present or a late bday, whatever and it doesn‚Äôt fit. Your dimensions in the sizing chart are horrifically wrong"
1.0,This watch is junk. Within 3 months watch stopped working reliably. Moisture got inside crystal from some spay. watch was never immersed in water. Return policy per seller is 30 days. I thought is was longer when I ordered.
1.0,I am disappointed. The chain tangled and broke before I could wear it. This was not a good purchase for me.
1.0,SO SMALL! I ordered a medium (I am 5'2 and 125) It gave me an instant muffin top and could barely clasp the back.
1.0,Don‚Äôt waste your money! When I tell you every last one 8 charms had the black croc piece not attached to it I was soooo mad.. I don‚Äôt know what kind of glue is being used but it‚Äôs cheap as heck.. Buyer be aware that that are made cheap but they look cute
1.0,"Not of good quality, the fit was awkward."
1.0,I go to open the box and pink sprinkles are everywhere.  The shoes were already falling apart.  They are sparkles that are stuck with hard glue.  If you bend the sho you hear it cracking and the sparkles fall off.  What garbage!!!!
1.0,"First time I wore it, it has tons of pulls. Not worth it."
1.0,I didn‚Äôt like that I was charged for returning this item
1.0,"This item is adorable, but it's poorly designed.  Because there are only two little hooks to close it, you cannot pack a lot in this bag, in fact after spending time trying to close it, even when flush the lock won't move.  Super bummed and it's way expensive for how cheap it is.  I'm frustrated that I now have to find a box to send this adorable but ineffective travel bag back.  Annoying."
1.0,Keychain lasted 2 days before one of the dice came off. POOR QUALITY - would not recommend purchasing.
1.0,Cute cat print but it doesn‚Äôt matter when it breaks less than a week after you put it on the watch.
1.0,"If you're looking for a belt to wear to church x a wedding, or other light duty stuff, this isn't bad. It weighs about 1/4 of a ""real"" gunbelt.  I honestly couldn't see this supporting more than a buck folder knife on a regular basis. Save up... And get a real gunbelt. This isn't it."
1.0,Too small for Adults
1.0,Ordered two sizes large. They fit skin tight. Will not order again.
1.0,What u pay u for is what u get. Only 2wks used and the second hand is spinning around and the time is faster than the actual Time
1.0,I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to wash these (my baby has only worn them one time) and there is already a hole in the seam. I‚Äôm not sure if I got a fluke or if this is common. I so wanted to love these since they‚Äôre so soft and they clearly would have fit my baby for a long time but unfortunately with the holes already they won‚Äôt last.
1.0,Says it fits model but it soes not
1.0,FABRIC IS LIKE SOME KIND OF PLASTIC! IT IS TERRIBLE! FITS SMALL
1.0,I ordered this item for a gift it didn‚Äôt fit the seller was contacted 3 times for a refund the seller never answered it took several day in order to get a refund I‚Äôm truly disappointed
1.0,Horrible broke in 5 mins s***ty quality
1.0,It broke 1 day of use. Product is crap.
1.0,i am not overly endowed.  this bra needs suspenders.  constantly rolls up like a window shade.  will use for sleep or around house.  not suitable for public use.
1.0,Zipper broke right away. Argh!
1.0,This was a disappointment. The earrings appear much larger in the photo than in reality and the colours are a lot less appealing that they appear to be.
1.0,Bought this as a gift.  The finish began wearing off after a week.
1.0,"Dress was shorter then expected material was so thin you can see right thru it, request a return UPS came to my door and returned it but NEVER got my refund. I have no number who or where to call......"
1.0,This product is flimsy material and real small. I recommend not to waste your money on this product
1.0,"Very disappointed it is made of inferior metal, has snags in the metal, looks like plastic on metal"
1.0,I was SO EXCITED to find this dress. I had seen almost identical styles on several boutique clothing sites. Ordered it for our family pictures. Just got it out of the washer and dryer and this thing shrunk like 6 inches. I‚Äôm so disappointed. I was hopeful even after reading reviews that this would not be the case. Now I‚Äôm scrambling to find another outfit to wear tonight.<br /><br />I bought a size medium. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù & 155 lbs
1.0,Wa way way to small and I ordered size xl and I am a size 8/10
1.0,Does not keep you warm
1.0,It's not waterproof. It fogs up after contact with water
1.0,Save your time and money
1.0,This is not flattering and the material is like a bathing suit.
1.0,I purchased this product with the expectation I would receive 4 PCS labret monroe lip ring etc. What did I receive? Oh let's see 4 braided bracelets that have absolutely nothing to do with the product that you are purchasing. Complete failure and scam. I have included a lovely photo of what was sent to me.
1.0,"Received mask with cardboard glued over each of the lenses. How am i supposed to see thru cardboard? What really sucks is I paid $43 just because I needed the lenses. Also, there is no battery cover on this device. I would like a refund for this...."
1.0,Fabric awful
1.0,"If your using these for your Tragus like it says don't.. they are to short and it's impossible to put the ball back in inside your ear... the top doesn't come off it's the balky that comes off and it's just a big pain, I just left them out, wasn't worth the effort"
1.0,These are tiny tubes of cheap fabric that I could barely get over my toes. They look nothing like the picture. Even my tiny girlfriend who is a foot shorter than me could not get them on. This had so much potential to be fun but it failed miserably.
1.0,I ordered three skulls and got three spider and one of them was defective and two  looked like they were used (was not in any type of packaging)<br />To be fair the two seemed to work great for what we had planned but not worth the cost.
1.0,The width was accessive And the length is nothing like the picture. Very disappointed. It was for a party and with all of the commotion I missed the 30 day return.
1.0,"I am 5'6, 125 lbs and I ordered a small in this dress and it fit like a tent.  The arms were the only fitted part of the whole dress.  It was also way too long.  It looked ridiculous so I sent it back."
1.0,I just got the dress today. Overall it is a very pretty dress but its 95%polyester not cotton !!!!!
1.0,does not take in air to filter
1.0,I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She maybe has worn them one time a week and they didn‚Äôt last for much more than a month. Cracked and peeling in numerous places.
1.0,"These are advertised as 100% cotton but in real life, no evidence of this. No label & very scratchy like sandpaper. This is not the bandana you are accustomed to when you think of super soft cotton. I purchased them, making sure they said 100% cotton so I could use them on my sensitive skin as face covering during the pandemic. Slow to arrive and too scratchy for my face. Boo."
1.0,Mom shorts!!! Ugh!!!!!
1.0,I should have purchased the other brand that was more expensive as they fit as they should . Pay for what you get.
1.0,The product was missing the vest and the top did not match the sizing provided. The company takes forever to respond and it is never helpful
1.0,Bought for my seven year old for school mask wearing.  Very shocked at how small they were (almost didn't fit over his head) and two  broke before leaving the house.
1.0,These are cheap.wore them one day and got holes in them. they are not very sturdy.will notbuythese again
1.0,"waste of money, print poorly done, very small, not soft"
1.0,"If I could of given no stars i would of some that. It's not what is displayed in the picture. Cheap material .99 cents material, its short. It's just poorly made. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLLER! Do not make the mistake i made."
1.0,I was very excited about th sunglasses but they broke the second time my daughter wore them.
1.0,The glasses lenses look different in the photograph. The lenses are blue reflective and look very cheap. I got what I paid for.
1.0,I did not like the way they fit.
1.0,Mala calidad nomas duro 2 semanas y se rompio de entre pierna
1.0,"Does work for my daughter, I think she's a super soaker but, it goes right through."
1.0,Well....only thing I liked was the color. It took a couple of weeks for me to receive it and I was VERY disappointed due to the flimsy see through material.
1.0,The design is just dingy yellow on black. Barely visible and printed in low resolution.
1.0,This ain't no 3x my goodness can't even wear them as pants atleast what's up with these sizes TERRIBLE !!!
1.0,It broke within the 1st day  Give this to say I'm not happy yes ma'am
1.0,This ring is very big and heavy. I could not hold my fingers together when wearing it. It is a worn out looking pink. I expected the pink gems to be brighter. Costume jewelry only.
1.0,They didn't even smell . Was not impressed
1.0,"Did not satisfy with the product, did not fit correctly for my kid"
1.0,Previouly bought the 15-30 mm compression  in medium and they fit fine. However  the  20 - 30 mm compression were too tight!
1.0,The material is poor cheap quality and very thin. Not at all what I expected.
1.0,Thin cheap material. Not compression at all. Feels like  cheap halloween costume material.
1.0,Incredibly small for my 5 year old....we couldnt even force it over her head. We ended up cutting them apart and sewed in 4 more inches of fabric..
1.0,Too short and didn‚Äôt fit well. Poorly made.
1.0,This item is hideous and looks nothing like it looks in the picture. I was so disappointed. It looks nothing like blue jean material but instead looks like a cheap shirt material. Very thin.
1.0,"Returned, did not fit well."
1.0,The material is very thin and too small
1.0,"Don't BUY it does not fit phone, cannot be modified to fit, either"
1.0,No me agrado.  Se rajo con solo meter el iPad
1.0,"Totally not as described - there is no zipper; there are NO SEQUINS; it is not 6.5"" higher on one side.  I ordered a true red sequin skirt - what I got was a light red, non-sequined, non-shiny, non holiday basic knit skirt.  If I had wanted a basic knit skirt, I would have ordered one."
1.0,Didn't work very well.
1.0,"These are pretty, but too small for what I wanted them for.  I wanted to use them to tie around a ponytail in my hair."
1.0,"Common, if your going to sell something like this don't put up a false picture of 20 squares full of 20 styles of piercings because that's going to give people an idea that its actually this many. Its completely stupid as hell to even include that damn picture when its just a small little cheap organizer with 8 boxes and a bag of cheap little 18 gauge piercings. Seriously, this is the stupidest s*** I have ever bought. Learn how to put up the right sale and not a picture of something it is not. No wonder the price keeps going down and then up nobody likes your lie. If i could i wouldn't give this even one star."
1.0,The image was distorted. Bad quality.
1.0,"maybe arms, no legs"
1.0,You get what you pay for.  This is junk!
1.0,Shirt would have been nice without all the material around the collar of the shirt. All the material around the collar causes the shirt to fit awkward in the neck area.
1.0,I brought two of these umbrellas for my kids but they are poorly made. It is difficult for the locking mechanism to catch by the handle to close and lock properly. Plus the metal frames were so sharp that I ended cutting myself trying to pull the umbrella close. Not appropriate for my kids and will definitely be returning.
1.0,"Arrived on time - thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Fit as expected based on reviews claiming these run small - I'm a 32 inch waist and I ordered a large, so the claims were right.<br /><br />Workmanship is shoddy at best, definitely not worth $20 when I have Champion shorts from Costco for half that price with $30 stitching and materials. Thread was hanging out the right side (too lazy to clip this off apparently) and back pocket was partially sewn closed (?!?). Too bad, I bought these specifically for the back pocket.<br /><br />Going back for a refund - thanks Amazon. Again."
1.0,Okay writing new on this bag it does hold a lot but the quality of inside material is bad. First the zipper on top kept getting snagged on material from inside linner so I sniped the fibers that stoped the zipper being closed. Now 6 months later the inside material is falling apart shredding and tearing apart sucks getting where there is no inside lining at all. Don't buy this bag if you're looking for quality this is really bad.
1.0,"These socks were worn once, washed and have a hole on the seam.  I would not order again!"
1.0,"My daughter had this necklace for about a week before the chain broke.  I know it isn't an expensive necklace, but she bought it with her own money and I would expect it to last longer than a week."
1.0,Loved the color and the look. Does not stay in tact and constantly falls off wrist
1.0,"These look okay, but won‚Äôt last long. They are very flimsy (feel like paper) and fragile. Not even worth the deal of $7. Looks like something you could get at the dollar store."
1.0,"Originally very pleased with product, but band broke after only a fee weeks of use.... disappointing."
1.0,Now I love these earring bought 2 sets of them I waited few months to write review and I was right me ear üëÇ turned out green and I am ocd when it comes to cleaning and removing earrings and etc
1.0,Soon as I got them the come A part
1.0,"I bought the shirt because I previously tried several different sellers from Amazon and the quality of the material was very bad. Well, this one was worse. There is no way the shirt has any cotton in it. When you touch the material it feels the same way a rain jacket or a nylon gym bag would feel. Absolutely horrible quality, will never buy a product from this seller again."
1.0,It doesn't fit on Samsung Gear s3.
1.0,"My daughter won't wear it because of how itchy it is.  In spite of my multiple washinhs, this is a no go."
1.0,Size not accurate and misleading
1.0,Just doesn't look good and was not breathable
1.0,These do not come as advertised. They hang down and are not cuff earrings. Tossed in trash.
1.0,"Bought this for fishing season this year, the item worked when I tested it upon arrival. 2 months later (now that fishing season started), did not work. I tested with 4 different external batteries and it would not power on. Very disappointed, had to cut fishing time since it was getting too cold being out with the vest not working. Garbage."
1.0,"too small, more like for a CHILD."
1.0,This was awful first thing ive returned from amazon. Cheap and did not fit at all says size 40 I wear 38 pants  and have other 38 belts that are fine this is way past maxed adjustment to almost fit.... cheap flimsy material. Return process was easy enough
1.0,"Poor quality, didn't fit right, and came with grey streaks on the right side shoulder area.  This thing should have cost 5 dollars, not 20 something..."
1.0,"Sadly, this was another baggy hat. I was really hoping for a nice, cozy, form fitting hat. Turtle Fur has always been a personal favorite and never failed to deliver.  I guess they've jumped into the ""slouchie"" beanie bandwagon. Too bad."
1.0,Surprising short strap - for child
1.0,"don't waste your time on these way shrunken socks. the add says their 100% cotton, but it says nothing on the package when you get it. i can't use them. don't bother. it says they fit 6-11. no way."
1.0,These were huge.  At least 3&#34; not 2&#34;.
1.0,"This shirt was very disappointing. It was more like a crop top. It‚Äôs also very heavy and stiff. Not comfortable at all. Would not recommend. Especially if you‚Äôre a big girl like me. I bought a 4x for extra room, I‚Äôm normally a 3x and it felt like a 2x"
1.0,Terrible fabric quality. They look like pajama pants.
1.0,The sizing is Weird and the fabric is absolutely awful.  This is a $5 costume top at best. I'm returning it.
1.0,Disappointed!!  hands do not glow in dark!.. smh
1.0,Had to return as I purchased small based on fitting chart!! Was WAY OFF‚Ä¶. SIZE UP if your ordering.
1.0,"For looks I would give it a 5. But for functionality defiantly a 1. It's hard and durable. But the problem comes when tou want to charge your phone or turn the volume up or down. Unless you have ling finger nails then the volume is very hard to control. You have to push very hard, and sometimes when you push down it will really go up. Also charging is an issue. Your charger won't fit if the case is on. So I literally have to take off my case everytime I want to charge my phone."
1.0,"Color is pale/lighter  than described, fit is not that secure, ordered size 8 could have used 7.5,  it's the type of material that'll create creases in the shoe after wearing a few days.  I plan to give them away. I likely will not buy this brand again.  Thank you but,  no!"
1.0,Nice concept but magnet in the one I got was way too weak to hold. Bought for my 12 year old and won't work on her tiny septum.
1.0,Product in no way looks like the product advertised
1.0,Go up in size
1.0,Unacceptable they came two days late and instead of 5 ring I received 3 very unsatisfactory
1.0,Literally just a big piece of fabric that you drape across your shoulders. No shape to it and definitely not a good look for people with broader shoulders.
1.0,"Snapped on 3rd time putting it on!  Extremely THIN, photos on here are very deceptive. Returned it for refund."
1.0,"Worked fine when not worn.  Lost 5 minutes an hour when worn.  Something obvious wrong inside, possibly loose mechanism."
1.0,So cheaply and poorly made im so angry i soed my money on this piece of crap. Frist use zipper broke shoulder strap is very weak .<br />Dont sped your money on this not worth it
1.0,I'm a grown man and they fall off my face. Too big!
1.0,Didn‚Äôt get what i expected. Felt like a regular undershirt. No compression what so ever! Rather pay more on InstaSlim.
1.0,Poor quality at least four size's to small no tags to disclose material or size
1.0,"The lizard doesn't screw back together, so I can't wear it. The ball on the butterfly broke, and the dreamcatcher fell off. The spider is fine so far, but I'm afraid to wear the cross because I don't want it to break, too."
1.0,Bought as a gift and gave about a week ago. My friend wore the boots this past week and boot has already separated from the soles.
1.0,I ended up returning them was not what I thought.
1.0,I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT THE SIZE OF THIS CAP
1.0,Makes outside brighter....
1.0,This is a scam
1.0,Clearly different product then the first time i ordered. They were so small and made so poorly I couldn't even fit over my hips.
1.0,I got the totally different bag
1.0,"I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase. I was expecting a shirt with the Yellowstone logo on it, but that is not what I received... I find the product that I received to be offensive..  it makes me feel like I am supporting something I am unaware of.."
1.0,Started to fall apart after 2 washes. Inside came out and is useless. Do not recommend:(
1.0,"I bought thus for my son, it took forever for it to get here. The packaging was poor, it did not come with directions for resetting th e time and it was super small"
1.0,Bracelets are poorly made and they started flaking as soon as they were taken out of their bags. Beads sent didn't fit in the bracelet tray. They claim to be adjustable but I'm not sure how that would work without damaging them. Not recommended at all.
1.0,Cheaply made . Supposed to be gold plated and after 3 days i have a green rng around my finger.
1.0,They were huge and heavy!
1.0,I received this in the mail but with only the wrist bands- not the headband.
1.0,"Wish I had tried the zipper before travelling all the way to New Zealand as it did not work at all. I was able to make due with the velcro, but very disappointing. It would not close the zipper at all and then would get stuck in the middle."
1.0,It worked fine for one week. It now loses about 5 minutes every hour.
1.0,Had to send these back and go back to the 3M once we'd had in the past. My 7 and 5 year olds didn't think these were as comfortable and they said they still let in a ton of noise.
1.0,"I have to say I was incredibly disappointed in this dress. I‚Äôve ordered dresses before and have been so happy with them. But this was one of those dresses where I didn‚Äôt even have to try it on, I knew as soon as I opened the package that I wouldn‚Äôt like it. Sure enough, I didn‚Äôt like it when it was on either. The style was not as expected, but blue is not a vibrant blue at all like what the model on the picture shows. It‚Äôs definitely snug, you will have to order a size up in my opinion. But the material and style just isn‚Äôt for me. Like I said, much cuter in the picture. I can‚Äôt return this fast enough."
1.0,cheaply made and runs very big for size
1.0,"Received today (Nov. 13, 2019) and  have started the return on this item from my office today (Nov. 13, 2019. First, the front part where there is the zipper and the section below the zipper containing two pockets do not line up; the pocketed section and the zipper part are off center. Second, the zipper is also flimsy and the item, although ordered in Large, is too snug - more of a medium. The item does not look nice like in the photo. In fact it looks like something a child just learning how to sew may have put together. This piece shows that there was no quality control."
1.0,The seams ripped on the first wear. Would not recommend
1.0,Runs way to small ordered an xl looked like a small
1.0,product is poorly made and absolutely huge.  Wouldnt buy again.
1.0,"it was supposed to be a new shirt,but it looked as though it had been worn ,returned,and stuffed into a plastic bag.there were no tags,no washing instructions.i was very disappointed.won't buy this brand again"
1.0,I bought them as a  early Christmas present but when my sister tried them on they were really hard to zip up.  She finally zipped them up and then could not unzip one of them.  We pulled at the zipper and the pull tag came off.  We could not get it fully unzipped.  So we pulled it off half zipped and my poor sister was in pain.  Terrible experience.  I want to return them.
1.0,I bought a bikini from here once before and I love the top but the bottom not so much. I think the bottom can be made a little differently.
1.0,"Way too short, much shorter than shown in illustration.  Returned them."
1.0,Made of weird plastic and terribly difficult to open and close
1.0,This dress is so incredibly tight. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 150 lbs.
1.0,Zipper was faulty and got stuck after trying it just a few times.  Do not recommend.
1.0,"Not as pictured. End pieces are cheap and loose inside the watch, the watch band does not match the description, the color/ finish is off, the band feels cheap compared to my other speidel bands I own. All said I‚Äôm very disappointed in a brand that I‚Äôve owned for over 20 years.<br /><br />I would not buy this product l, it is cheaply made in China and not the quality you expect to receive."
1.0,Very small. I can barely fit it around my neck on the last ring. I like it otherwise but now I have to buy an extender.
1.0,This Necklace Was So Small I Won‚Äôt Even Bither Wearing It. Major Disappointment
1.0,Good gosh this thing is tiny!!! Not even close to an XL. It fits like a small.
1.0,This watch strap is complete garbage. Junk is what you get. Save your self a huge headach and order something else.
1.0,Poor poor quality and no return availability
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:b252cf130c0a73b220c98f981ff7464c]] It doesn‚Äôt come with the rhinestones like the picture shows, and they‚Äôre misleading customers to think that wasting time and moneyüò°"
1.0,Too short and wide! Size sucks! Trying to get a replacement size was a joke! Waste of money for sure.
1.0,Only received 1 pair of glasses when it was supposed to be 10 pairs. Feeling kind of swindled. Happy 2022‚Ä¶I returned them.
1.0,Soft pot metal and falls apart in a few days. Pretty to look at but not wearable. I had to give at least one star??? Don't waste your time.
1.0,I didn't get the item pictured. The headband wasn't black nor was the feathers.
1.0,"These O-rings I think will be just about worthless for repairing watches.  I was going to put new O-rings in my watches when I changed batteries.  These O-rings were much thinner than what was in any of my watches.  I felt safer reusing the old O-rings.  Look closely at the picture of the package, it says they are 0.5 mm dia.  I measured these O-rings and they are 0.3 mm and my watches all need 1mm dia.  Complete waste of money for me.  I would not recommend these to anyone."
1.0,its very short - for a teen.
1.0,"Very poorly designed.  It took me almost  1/2 hour to put this on the first time. Going home was a little better, but no piece of cake. I have another from a different manufacturer but that one doesn't have a TSA approved lock. This is a good idea, just poorly executed"
1.0,A big nope. This watch is only for kids who don't see the value.
1.0,I ordered this for my friends baby girl for her 1st birthday. It was too tight do she couldn‚Äôt wear it. I wish I could return it.
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt like that it wasn‚Äôt true to size, and the seller wasn‚Äôt really cooperative about the whole thing, it‚Äôs a waste of money, I asked seller to cancel it before it was shipped because I wouldn‚Äôt have time to return it, & they didn‚Äôt cancel it, I don‚Äôt recommend this to anyone"
1.0,Started changing form and losing diamonds after second use.
1.0,Not worth it. I feel like I just let a poor over worked child in some other country loose a finger for it to not even be cute and I won't be able to get more than 2 wears out of it. I'm normally a xs in us sizing and a large didn't fit correctly. I feel bad for the over worked factory kid who made it. Its honestly so bad and its not even the kids fault. Like I feel like a bird because its that cheap cheap cheap material that they use for Halloween costumes
1.0,"The comfort and functionality are great. However, the hinge material that connects and allows you to tilt them is simply a thin piece of plastic that broke within a few weeks and not a lot of use. And not at all repairable. If you never tilt them maybe they would have lasted longer but that was the reason for purchasing. Unless they strengthen the adjusting hinge I would not recommend."
1.0,"I have the medium (which I love) and bought the small as I wanted it for everyday use - after triple checking that the description says ""Quick-adjust removable shoulder strap""  on the small , I ordered it as I could not see it in the picture , I ordered one . Well there is no ""Quick-adjust removable shoulder strap"" and no loop to attach one - so I cannot sling it across my body and am returning it.<br /><br />The product looks as well made as the other one I have and is rated 1 star as it does not meet the description or my needs - which coincide with the description"
1.0,Very bad quality. The size is much smaller than expected.
1.0,Sleeves were tight and fit was snug.  I like more loose fitting.  Not as pictured at all.  All products made in China and non-returnable.
1.0,"Ugly and cheap, these might be the flimsiest, cheapest-feeling glasses I've ever owned. I guess you get what you pay for. They're in a car pocket for dire emergencies..."
1.0,I was really hoping that this dress would be a ‚Äúto die for ‚Äú but it‚Äôs a big let down. I ordered up a size just because I‚Äôve been burned before. This dress wouldn‚Äôt even fit in<br />My right thigh. Buyers beware double check the sizing snd then ordered up 2 or 3 sizes.
1.0,"Received the necklace - was very disappointed that other than the moon, it's nothing at all like the picture.  The owl pendant, hits the moon and does not hang freely without hitting it, you can barely tell there is an owl as the ""picture"" is grainy under a bubble looking cover? (Think of it as looking at a picture thru a raindrop).  There is no square looking gem at the top of the necklace / pendant - it's just a cheap chain attached with a o-ring.  See my pictures ... the owl doesn't even look the same and you cannot read the letters AOE clearly, and the greek meander (or key = the square spiral around the outer edge) isn't even clear and barely visible. Waste of cash in my opinion. Only reason I gave it 1 star is because you have to give one."
1.0,These are too long dont buy them for military boots!!
1.0,"Very cheap quality, not as pictured"
1.0,Mask was small too few layers and smelled like rubber products even after washing twice.
1.0,I was very disappointed that this order only had 48 keyfobs not 50 like advertised. Buy at your own risk!
1.0,If I could give a negative 5 star review I would . This is not cashmere and the length and shape is awful . I can‚Äôt believe this company is actually selling this !!!!!
1.0,"This was bought for my daughter and my self as gifts from our family leprechaun. Hers lasted a day and mine lasted little more than that. Very cheeply made, the glass fell out and the chain came apart on both."
1.0,"These are absolutely horrible made, and started to fall apart the first time my daughter wore them."
1.0,I wouldn't even give this product 1 star. They are super cute but after wearing once they look horrible!!
1.0,With them being adjustable I thought it would b wide with
1.0,"Returned for full refund<br />The label said 100% cotton, but I don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs what the fabric really is made of.<br /> It felt more like a man-made fabric and like rayon. It also required dry cleaning üëéüèªüëéüèª<br />I have serval linen and cotton pants, and it‚Äôs definitely not made from any of these types of fabrics. ‚òπÔ∏è"
1.0,This is for a child not even a mans! So disappointed my 16 year old grandson really wanted these sweats. There is also a big hole under the left arm pit! My pics are of just a lg suit and I ordered a 2XL!
1.0,Do not buy this it's not a bathing suit.
1.0,Just wasn‚Äôt big enough and I order two sizes bigger than I am
1.0,Sent the wrong one.
1.0,I wouldn‚Äôt get this if you like soft cotton materials. It‚Äôs more like a shiny polyester
1.0,These are infact made with latex. The description lists them as latex free.
1.0,"After just two washings sweatshirt so pilled it is not suitable for anything but yard work.  Fabric very cheap and does not hold up well.  Also shrank more than most shirts.  Now a misshaped, under-sized, pilled-up piece of trash.  Spend more and get a better made piece of clothing.  This one was a waste of money."
1.0,"Not great material, super cheap, defiantly not a dress, at least not for someone that is 5'8"" it barely covered my bottom!"
1.0,Very flimsy.... not worth the price
1.0,Clips on strap broke right away.
1.0,Completely see through and very thing. Soft and cute but haven't worn it because how see through it is.
1.0,"The fit is tight and I got an XL. Also before I even got to wear it, the threads were coming undone. Horrible quality."
1.0,"Waited 2 months for this. Looks nothing like the picture. Big,  ugly,  and cheap. Nasty thing. Was going to give to my daughter as a gift,  but might be usable as dressup for kids. If not donate"
1.0,Purchased for my father and it broke as he was putting it on for the first time.
1.0,Ordered a xxl looked like a small
1.0,"Not sure who wrote all the other glowing reviews of this ring, but please don't waste your money! The stones are dull and metal so thin it wore through after very few wearings. I received no response to my request for help from customer service. Save your money, don't buy this cheaply made junk."
1.0,I ordered a childs 7-8 and it fits like an adult small.<br />Not for children.
1.0,The storage pockets are too small for most of my cords and plugs.
1.0,Do not buy cheap cheap cheap
1.0,Dis not come with a charger
1.0,"I just got these in the mail I ordered them for my boyfriend, they are nothing like the picture. I got some ugly black checkered tic tax toe board looking stud earrings. Super disappointed and Christmas is almost here."
1.0,Very strange fit. The mid section between your legs is extremely baggy like a diaper. I sent it back.
1.0,"Way too small,  not at all close to what I ordered. Such a waste of time to constantly return things that really don‚Äôt represent the REAL size of what you order."
1.0,"Not worth $26, feels very cheap.  Ships from China, expect to wait at least a month."
1.0,"Did not look as good in person, I had bought these as a gift for my mom. Would not purchase this item again."
1.0,"I personally did not like the fit on me , I thought it made me look old."
1.0,Skintight. Not for me.
1.0,This was not cotton like in any way. The shiny fabric did not stretch in any way.
1.0,The dress was super cute however it was WAY TOO SMALL. I returned it.
1.0,My necklace won't stay fastened.  I almost lost my FitBit Flex 2.
1.0,"Got a lemon set. Returned it. Even if it didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs was cheap quality and would‚Äôve still returns it. If I saw it at the dollar store, maybe I wouldn‚Äôt gotten it."
1.0,"I couldn't even get these on my ears. Putting on the back was impossible because I ended up just bending the silver front and I couldn't bend them back into place. Did not enjoy them, would not repurchase."
1.0,They ripped after the<br />First wash. Of note I did not dry them and they still were totally ripped.
1.0,"I wore it to a wedding, fell apart before the wedding started üôÉ"
1.0,I bought this Toe ring two years ago and just recently lost it in the ocean last week. I was very upset so I decided to go through my history and see if I could purchase it again. I was happy to see that they were still making this certain toe ring so I ordered it again it was only about five dollars more no big deal. It  was delivered yesterday I put it on and I was very disappointed to feel how thin and very fragile the gold was my other toe ring was very hard and sturdy almost hard to where you couldn‚Äôt mold it sometimes to your toe but it was fine because I knew it was thick and durable. This toe ring is very thin and flexible and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs going to last.
1.0,Glass is plastic and the watch is not so good. Just got mine and the watch is frosting from the inside
1.0,"By the looks I expected a tee-shirt or Jersey feel and fit. Unfortunately it is all polyester clingy, staticky, rides up and doesn‚Äôt breathe!  Being this way, it‚Äôd have to be twice the size to be comfortable as o don‚Äôt like fitted clothes when I sleep...baggy and loose."
1.0,"The photo is deceiving it doesn't even look like the photo at all it looks like something you would get at a vending machine for little kids, my girlfriend put it on this morning and an hour later it was broken already, I wouldn't buy this product it is literal garbage."
1.0,Took these leggings out hiking twice and got holes in them. I have 2 other pairs of these leggings in different colors and both of them hold up nicely. I think it is the material the black leggings are made out of- they feel cheaper than the other pairs.
1.0,Runs extremely small and isn‚Äôt as flattering as the picture. The color is more yellow-y than the picture too
1.0,sizes run way smaller than they say
1.0,No other color available to choose.

1.0,"Poor quality material, would not recommend."
1.0,Broken when receiving
1.0,They said height would fit up to 5‚Äô8. Yeah if that was 5inches shorter. Stockings came up to just above my knees.

1.0,"The tip broke off immediately, then another chunk broke off just because it rolled on my glass desk. Silly."
1.0,Super cheap material. You can see through it. It looks like if you wash it it would fall apart.  I will be returning it.
1.0,Sizing is way off. I bought an XL and I couldn't get it over my shoulders
1.0,"No  compression at all, thin material, maybe only for people who just needs minor smoothing, did not Work out for me."
1.0,"It‚Äôs $5 whatever but, yeah both suction cups are almost melted or badly formed and will not stick to anything."
1.0,"cheap looking, not easily stackable... I should have returned!"
1.0,"Once you've removed your current watch band, you cannot reuse them. Therefore, without pins in the new band, it's useless. Looks nice otherwise."
1.0,"This dress is not like the pictures, ordered the light grey, the stitching is crooked making the lines fall wrong on the body.  The material is very thin and stretchy so it hugs the body not swinging like the pictures.  It‚Äôs like this dress is a knock off of the one in the pictures.  Plus it will cost me $6 to return so disappointing üòìü§Ø"
1.0,"Love the style, but one of the earrings broke after only wearing twice."
1.0,"i don't think it would have fit my 2 year old. cheap. think material, thread snags everywhere. I threw it in the trash. whoever made it should be embarrassed."

1.0,"Mala calidad de tela. Luego de lavarlo la primera vez le salieron bolitas, desperfecto de tela como cuando tiene m√°s de un a√±o de uso. Mala compra"
1.0,Not true to size. And it is not returnable.
1.0,"Poorly made and fits weird. The cut is all wrong, tight in the sleeves and the yoke is poorly laid. I submitted a request to return it but it would cost more to do that than the amount I paid for the blouse. It's on the way to the Goodwill."
1.0,The last silver polishing cloth we purchased on Amazon was amazing. Worked great right out of the package. This cloth however did nothing except help me exert some effort and calories. Will trashing this one and ordering another brand.
1.0,The Taylor logo is an iron on transfer & the hat does not keep its shape.
1.0,If you want to sell in the US get the sizing right
1.0,Very poor quality.  Lasted a very short time of use.  Tears and holes .  Cheap material
1.0,"This sweatshirt is horrible! It is way too loose and the zipper hardly zippers. The material is very cheap. I tried contacting the seller to send back for two weeks until I finally contacted amazon. The seller then got back to me, but after having to pay the shipping to return it is not worth it. I will be throwing this into the trash. Don't waste your money."
1.0,See comment above.
1.0,This did not fit my son for who I ordered it and on top of that the material was cheap and was damaged when I opened the package cheap ratty s***
1.0,"This came fast, but was way too small. I couldn't even fit one boob in, and the zipper was bad quality.  If you order this order many sizes up/"
1.0,The description says sterling silver but it's not. After using it three times it became tarnished.
1.0,Was a waste of money! Terrible quality! Bought this dress for my daughter's 11th birthday. She just loved it but it only last for her to just try it on as the zipper broke. So now she's really disappointed that she won't have a dress for her birthday. So don't waste your money on this as its just terrible quality.
1.0,The straps are so small that it‚Äôs really unusable for my lifestyle. Will just be gifting it to my niece because it‚Äôs perfect size for a child
1.0,very poorly made. It rusted within days!
1.0,Bought for costume one-time only. Poor quality. Top keeps rolling down the leg. will never wear.
1.0,"This shirt is beautiful, but sadly it came with no buttons. Also it fits on the bigger side. I will have to go buy buttons and try to put them on to actually wear it to work."
1.0,Did not like the fit at all. Tight in spots too big in others.

1.0,"Really liked it at first. Very strong magnet stayed in place on golf cart. Would have given it five stars until now. The internal magnets have come loose that seal the lid flap closed. Now LASER is in danger of falling out of the case. Of course, it‚Äôs now past the return window, which ended just three weeks ago, so I am stuck with it. Would not recommend buying."
1.0,I've only worn a pair of these 2 and they ripped.
1.0,Fell apart when I open it
1.0,Cheap..Save money
1.0,Too short for plus sizeibart women
1.0,the area under the bust is so tight and has no give. I read the reviews and went up in size and it was still way too tight in just that one area. The rest of the dress would have fit perfectly.
1.0,horrible material it is not your typical workout material it is paper thin and see through if u squat they are thinner than leggings. Unless u have a flawless body go for it but if your using it to work out dont do it.
1.0,"all of the gold has fallen off after two months, I had to get it repaired. I am very disappointed."
1.0,"Purchased these Solar PVC Light Caps about 3 weeks ago, 1 out of the 4 came out of the box broken. It was packed differently, batteries were loose in the box. Now another light has recently stopped working, not a premium product, should have purchased 8 cheaper lights and had replacements. Update, I purchased the Duracell green 5 year batteries and now they work. Their batteries were bad. Very disappointing!"
1.0,Worn once - ripped & frayed.
1.0,"Absolutely adorable looking mask, but there is a horrific toxic smell that I could not get rid of.  I literally scrubbed it several times with various soaps, a vinegar and covered it overnight with baking soda...nothing helped.  It still smells a month later."
1.0,These were way bigger than USA sizes. There was blood on the laces...<br />Return was simple and easy.
1.0,Ordered 5 boxes of these to hand out to kids @ 4th of July event as outreach for church.<br /><br />There appears to be about a 1-4 success rate.  So out of 4 lights we got a bad one.<br /><br />Bad ones ranged from:<br />Dead batteries or faulty switch.<br />VERY dim.<br />Didn't stay bright long.<br /><br />Odd ball issues found were:<br />Wrong color LEDs in plastic.  Example:  Red light in blue casing.  Yellow light in white casing.<br /><br />Very disappointed in the product.<br /><br />Good thing:<br />1) Arrived quickly.<br />2) Nice cardboard box they arrived in.
1.0,"Terrible quality,seams fell apart almost completely down the sides, had a 2‚Äù hole in the seam when taken out of pkg. Slip seemed to just barely be sewn together."
1.0,Very cheap chains were breaking and wouldn't lay right only a couple days after buying.
1.0,Nunca fue entregado no recib√≠ esta art√≠culo porque tengo que darle una estrella si yo no se si es bueno.
1.0,"Ordered an XL as a gift, and it is so huge 3 people could fit in it. If you want one to fit a regular size guy, should probably order a medium at most."
1.0,To small especially in the sleeves.
1.0,Looks terrible and cheap.
1.0,"This purse is adorable, but the strap has already broken off!!!!  I was careful qith how I wore it. It was not beat up in any way.  Less than 4 months and it is broken!!!!"
1.0,Ordered this bracelet for my son not true to size what so ever more for new borns my son is 2!!!
1.0,"The wallet looks great in the picture, but when I actually received it, it was very thin and you could see the yellow material it was made out of"
1.0,My wife ordered this for a beach cover-up. She ordered two sizes larger than normal size. The material is like tissue paper and the sizing is very small.
1.0,Not a good fit. Pants too long. Vest too small.
1.0,These were not Polo Ralph Lauren Thompson Relaxed-Fit Jeans. They didn't even look the same as the pic. They're some kind of a knock-off but not Polo Thompson cut.
1.0,"This jacket is so ugly, material so horrible,"
1.0,It is very unfortunate that this bracelet only lasted a week. My daughter received it for Christmas and In a couple days the main charm fell off. We have fixed it twice and it keeps coming off. It bends very easily and is poor quality.
1.0,"Buyer beware:  This watch only lasted 9 months.  The second hand works still, but the other two flop uselessly around the dial, governed by gravity now.  They pulled completely free of their gear it appears. You can no longer set the time, or read the time.  $130!!  I feel so gypped.  I wouldn't buy this again if it were $25.  Long Island Watch: you're running a racket charging people 10x what a watch is worth.<br /><br />I should mention the watch designer decided to bevel the crystal right over the markings, leading to diffraction and double vision.  I was disgusted, but kept it anyway.  Also the acid wash/antiquing on the metal case wears off easily due to your sweat.<br /><br />The watch looks good with an olive 20mm  NATO nylon strap.  It comes with a mousey brown &#34;leather&#34; strap, not the rich orangey brown strap pictured here."
1.0,It was a lot smaller than it looks online.  I threw it away
1.0,When putting the strap in the plastic clip or Release Buckle the strap slides out and will not hold tention.  I had to sew it in place in order for it to not fall off of my wrist. Good quality every where else but unless you want to staple the strap down or sew it then I would not buy it.
1.0,I wanted 3X comfortable this shirt fits like a medium it's not comfortable when I have to give it to one of my kids to Tiny
1.0,The dress is a linen material and flowy but it‚Äôs completely see through! You could see my skin color through most of the dress! I‚Äôm really sad because the fit was amazing.
1.0,Do not order this!  Sequins fall off after wash!  It‚Äôs horrible because it‚Äôs so cute but not worth it!
1.0,Looks better on line
1.0,"Pretty earrings, but I gave these to my sister as a birthday gift and broke the same day. Would appreciate a refund and a new pair."
1.0,"Like others have said, this is made with very cheap quality."
1.0,"Very Flimsy, one of them broke already"
1.0,Fit a lot smaller than what was expected
1.0,Muy grande la medida y para el frio no sirven no son calientes
1.0,"This was the wrong color, olive green, and I ordered a little boys small and got an adult small."
1.0,Nice stiching does not fit
1.0,this boxer is extremely short it should not be feature when a search is done for long leg boxers.  long leg means that it fits down the thigh not up in the seat.  It is not even 2 inches good from the seat of the boxer.
1.0,not worth it.......made from cheap fabric. I guess you do get what you pay for
1.0,"Junk made, and it states about the voice change. That is the screaming as the cheap plastic is cutting your skull open"
1.0,"Turned my nose blue after 2 days wearing each. Sad because I wasted my money. They are pretty, but not worth the skin irritation."
1.0,"I wear size XL. So knowing how overseas sizing is so much smaller than USA sizing, I ordered this ZICUE women's short sleeve V-neck dress in size XXL. I received it....after a period of time....this dress is a size Medium by USA sizing standards!!!  I ordered another dress from a different maker (different name anyway) in a size XXXL. And it certainly is the correct size. Therefore, I cannot wear either dress!!! I won't be ordering any more clothes over the internet!! Lesson learned."
1.0,"Did not like the feel of the pants, and also one of the pair of pants tore in the pocket seam very easily."
1.0,"The idea is good, but very thin material, with no padding underneath. Overpriced for what it is."
1.0,Kept sending me the wrong size. Not bad looking but definitely a bit wide and short.
1.0,They lasted 2 months before the arms broke off. Waste of money!
1.0,"I thought that the pattern was a little more muted in color. It was very bright and bold, which made me feel less bohemian and more ‚ÄúFloridian Retiree!‚Äù I‚Äôm sure many people would love it, but it made me feel like I was in a housecoat ready to drink coffee and do a crossword puzzle."
1.0,Incredibly hard to put on. My first shower with it the red Handicapped logo got washed away. They didn't say to not shower with it.<br />Now I have to figure out how to put some permanent red in there. If that's possible. And I payed $15.00 to get it engraved other wise<br />I'd want my money back. First bummer I have ever bought on Amazon.
1.0,"This is a fantastic looking watch, it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted and I love the look and functionality of it, my only issue is it‚Äôs a struggle to keep the battery from going down to ‚Äúlow‚Äù I work outdoors and am in the sun A LOT and after a weekend of not going out except a bit during the day and mostly at night the battery jumps down to medium and already once it‚Äôs gone down to low and went into a power saving mode. I‚Äôve had regular casios for years and the battery never had any issues the main reason I wanted this was to not worry about the battery dying and it‚Äôs all I worry about now with this watch."
1.0,The layer on the Lense washed off when cleaned it with water.  Now it has spots that the blue layer is missing.  Not recommending it.
1.0,They looked great when they arrived. But after the first wash you lose most of the length. So what was a large is now a belly shirt. Kid does not like the fit at all.
1.0,"The feeling of this bra is ""inflated"" and huge puffy lining; I returned it."
1.0,"The dress came and fit as expected. However, the headband came broken and without the 1/2 printed on it as advertised.  This was very disappointing as we needed the outfit in 2 days and don't have time to exchange it. üòï"
1.0,"Stoopid me - bought these not realizing that I DID want the side loading for cards, NOT the top loading inserts like these (so that cards can fall out of the wallet if it's tipped upside-down).  Fortunately., I just found one of my last old order of side loading inserts, so I'm OK for a few months until it starts to crack apart or get brittle.  Anyone need my 4 other inserts?"
1.0,"received wrong item.<br />Ordered a XL and receide a medium<br />quality is not the best, but we expect better for this price.<br />anyway is size was correct the deal was not too bad...anyway not recommended"
1.0,Would not recommend! Way over sized
1.0,"Nice glasses however when I cleaned them with the supplied cleaning towel it scratched the lens. Update: Lens just popped out, returning glasses."
1.0,"It only lasted 1 year, that is why I am buying a new one. I would like to change it by a metal one."
1.0,Nothing compare to the picture
1.0,It is ridiculously tiny- as if it were made for a child.
1.0,"not well made - the 2 sides of the heart wouldn't stay together & the funnel didn't come w/ the product, disappointed"
1.0,Looks like a cheap childs costume rather than a nice light weight cloak. Looks like felt and poorly made. Very disappointing. I was really looking forward to wearing it.
1.0,This was so ugly. Looks a like a beige garage bag.
1.0,jewel fell apart while i was putting necklace on
1.0,Just broke the second day that I had it I do not advise anybody to buy it it falls apart
1.0,La calidad mala muy mal terminadas nada resistentes
1.0,"Save your money. Bought this necklace wore it once and the chain and letter tarnished! Very cheap, too bad bc it‚Äôs supper pretty"
1.0,Needs to be used with a belt. I need one with clips.
1.0,"One side of the scarf was WAY longer than the other side.  It was very soft, but this is about the only thing going for it.  And it took forever to arrive.  It went straight to the Goodwill box."
1.0,"This shirt is thin, crappy metal buttons. Piece of junk!!!"
1.0,I am allergis to synthetic fabrics. The band around chest is completely plastic or rubber or whatever and not covered by fabric. Waste of money for me.
1.0,Bought the burgundy and it looks nothing like the picture. It is way lighter and it is cheap looking material. Not sure how they can charge $50 for it. So disappointing. Really wanted to love this. Size xl fits a bit oversized.
1.0,"Lenses are foggy, hazy!"
1.0,Save your time and money. I bought it for todays LSAT exam. The watch did not work at all. Just don't bother with this.
1.0,I can‚Äôt rate this dress because unfortunately it looks like someone wore it before me and ripped it sent it back and it was packaged back up and sent to me wow
1.0,This is not a true Bera Bradley purse.  It‚Äôs a knock off being sold under the Vera Bradley name. I have had multiple Vera purses of this style and this is for sure not the real deal.
1.0,"I purchased this for the easy-on quick-snap clasp in order to convert our retractable leash to better suit my mother's arthritic hands. BUT IT BROKE this morning, letting our guy loose!! DO NOT USE ON A LEASH, or in anything else you don't want to loose!@"
1.0,"Disappointing a lot of loose threads, they look cheap"
1.0,"I've worn this for maybe a month. Never wear it in water and this is what has happened to it. Get what you pay for, for sure on this one!"
1.0,"The print on Bottoms is the only positive thing that I can say, didn't expect great quality for the price but material and workmanship are terrible. Proportion were way off on top both sides were completely different sizes and bottoms front panel too big and back panel smaller than front (thought for sure I had it on backwards) laces that are on sides of bottoms don't even line up I could keep going but needlessto say will be returningand will never purchase from this manufacturer again. I am 5'3"" 120lbs and bought a medium which is a size bigger than any of my other suits."
1.0,Beautiful dress but completely sheer.  I returned it
1.0,Material not as pictured. Don‚Äôt waste your $$
1.0,Not a long cardigan as seen on model. Back barely hits top of pants. Be cautious when buying....
1.0,This shirt did not fit well at all! Very disappointed in it.
1.0,"Injured skin behind ears, a piece of junk"
1.0,Did not fit as expected. Material very thin and see through. Not pleased.
1.0,As it was posted on display it looked like a set but it was a single item it was valued high for the purchase of just the top.<br />So not ‚Äúvalue for money.‚Äù
1.0,"We recieved these jammers yesterday and my son only wore them once swimming for couple of hours. The fabric around the back/bottom area already shows extensive wear and has faded away with some threads pulling. The fit is also really strange, fits right around the waste but the legs are super loose, almost looking like shorts. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1.0,Gold rubbed off on my dress and discolored it.
1.0,"Not the color I was expecting at all. Pretty cheap looking. The ankle strap is so loose, very unflattering. I tried flattening out the ankle strap but no luck. Looks terrible and cheap. The color is not even close to the picture.<br /><br />When trying to return they completely ignored me and now I'm so upset I ever bought these!!! Now I lost $35 on some stupid shoes I can't wear!!"
1.0,First pair was broken in package returned And received replacement. Was given as gift product broke again didn‚Äôt even make it 1/2 a day wearing before earrings fell apart.
1.0,Beautiful idea but didn‚Äôt come with instructions to size photos or adhesive as noted in the product description.
1.0,Do not buy these laces unless you have a 5 eyelet sneaker or shoe. The laces are incredibly short AND they are hard to thread. The end pieces are not standard and are fairly large.
1.0,It's super cute but broke after wearing it twice
1.0,"The material of the waist band and leg holes was so uncomfortable they were unwearable for more than a few hours. Body material also wasn't very soft, even though the fit was better than I expected from what they looked like. Overall I ended up throwing them away, waste of money."
1.0,Broke within an hour of wearing it. Sending it back and really disappointed.
1.0,Not close to what picture shows. Weird material and sizing is way off
1.0,"Garbage. Both rubber bands have now snapped due to the plastic/carbon plates being too sharp and eventually cutting through the rubber bands leaving you with a pocket full of loose credit cards and id's. If you like this concept, it would be cheaper to buy a bag of bubbler bands and band your cards and id's together. Very disappointed, wish it wouldhave lasted."
1.0,"Worst product ever, sizes do not meet expectation at all. Basically this is a scam product."
1.0,Dislike it. Too small
1.0,Pants were sewn backwards. The tie is in the back the pockets go the wrong way
1.0,Product quality is garbage. Buy one locally.
1.0,I got this for my wife she is a medium... we received this it fit my 11 year old lol
1.0,"Not bad product but it was WAY too big for my sons head, it won‚Äôt fit a 1 yr old."
1.0,Not as pictured. Material is very cheap - not soft and it doesn't hang nicely. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Beautiful and perfect length!!!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and it hit the floor. But the product came with a giant hole in the armpit
1.0,It had a scuff and lots of bumps on it very cheap looking!
1.0,"Way, way too small. Usually wear a 14/L .. ordered the biggest size they had and it would maybe fit one thigh if I‚Äôm being generous.<br /><br />Otherwise cute."
1.0,Mareos
1.0,"It was ok the color was cute the caller was cute but the fit was just way off, it clung to my body and the sleeves kept riding up my armpit."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Had to trim threads off of the outfit all over! The bows on the shirt are glued on and fell off during the very first wash.  Had to stitch them back on. The tag says dry clean only...Seriously?! Who dry cleans toddler play clothes that are made of cotton and polyester?
1.0,Poor quality of material.
1.0,The factory must have workers sewing in the dark?
1.0,I just received my multicolor evil eye bracelet horrible !! Looks like they colored the eyes themselves . Looks like it was bought from a dollare store .. Looks nothing how they show. Only reason got one star was cause I had to . It deserves NONE
1.0,It was so large I could not how to figure out how to try it on!  Too much in the front
1.0,This was a Christmas gift so I was very disappointed that we couldn't get the clasp open. I should have read the reviews before ordering!!!
1.0,The carabiner is shaky and cheap. I bought this and wanted something else but when I went to return they made me pay for the shipping and were gonna refund me like 3$ after cutting out 6$ for return shipping.
1.0,These were so cute but according to reviews I ordered a smaller size well those were absolutely HUGE!!! Would've probably fit a women's smaller sized feet. Had to send back because he probably wouldn't have fit in them for at least the next few years. :(
1.0,Cute but not usable!
1.0,If it doesn't fit nothing else matters
1.0,"Poor quality.  I've worn them twice, (as leisure pants, haven't worn them to the gym) and there is a rip from the top of the pants all the way to the inner thigh.<br /><br />Not worth the money."
1.0,"I've got a Maxxsel M5006 bought from this company in May. Finally put it on (weather turned cold) and discovered the right sleeve cuff is actually a left sleeve cuff. You don't notice these things till you snap the cuff twice. Mine is a snap model.<br />On second use, the left sleeve cuff on the right sleeve, snap pulled right out of the material. With both parts. I tried using a pliers to clasp the snap base to the cuff material, got part way there, and the second snap in bit went in. Unsnapping pulled out  the snap base along with the snap in piece. Right cuff is totally useless. Note all my technical terms in this paragraph :-)<br />It IS warm. Until the rest of the snaps pull out and it becomes a dog bed.<br />I think my complaint about this purchase is that nothing in the item description said it was made by some other company I'd never heard of. Woodland Supply, in this instance, is just selling Chinese junk clothes. The tag still in mine says &#34;$79.&#34; I paid $24. There's a lesson."
1.0,Not at all what you think it is. It‚Äôs boxy and the fabric is so cheap.
1.0,They are extremely low rise. They were lower then my underwear. Also the sell makes it very hard to return no free return. Never would have bought them if I had seem that. DO NOT BUY!!!!
1.0,Too small no bale on this charm .totally useless
1.0,The leggings I received looks nothing like the picture. Truly dissatisfied!
1.0,It is very pretty dress however it fits large. I am a size 10 12 in any brand. I ordered this one in 12 it was way too large.<br />I would recommend to size down. The fabric is stretchy and pretty colors.<br />It is confusing the size chart. They should explain better which chart read.
1.0,Blasphemy is not cool or funky. This is offensive and could be considered hate speech. Don't support this product.
1.0,Very bad fit. I am a classic medium. All Mediums have fit me perfectly but everyone was complaining it was to large and long so I ordered a small and it was awful! Still to large!! It has elastic around the inside of the top opening and it bunches up like a granny dress. I have decent wide shoulders so this was surprising. It didn't fit around the boobies either. It gapped around the armpit and under the boobs. Ugh! Don't be deceived by the picture!
1.0,"These were terrible. The second I went to stretch them to put them on, they tore. I am only 5'6. I bought these previously from the same page but they were the ones that clip to your socks. These ones are just useless"
1.0,They are nice but they need to be stretched out so they are wearable
1.0,"The women's shirt is very small, I ordered an XL but it was more the size of a medium.  I love the shirt but unfortunately the size will not allow me to wear this as anticipated."
1.0,"Arrived completely smashed, can't get it to shape.....Very disappointing"
1.0,It's hardly been a month and the second hand has already stopped moving rendering the whole watch useless.
1.0,Don‚Äôt recommend  it. I am a size medium and the product fits like a Xl.
1.0,"Cheap, too small, not wearable."
1.0,This hat is VERY cheaply made.  The bill is flimsy and didn‚Äôt seem to be able to hold a shape.  The dome is very shallow.  Poor quality and execution.  Don‚Äôt waste your time on this
1.0,"The design is stamped on the fabric unlike regular bandanas where the design was woven into the fabric.  The stamped designs quickly chip away after a few washings.  If I wanted colored fabric, I could have made these myself."
1.0,This is trash. Super thin and cheap. I ordered a size up and was still to small. It looks like a silky trash bag. Total junk.
1.0,"Good quality, good fit. BAD LOGO DESIGN. Shame on me for not noticing the shirt says ""Average Toel"" instead of ""Average Joe's"". Do not buy unless you want to look like a dummy."
1.0,The material was not flattering for my body type and it was too small. Not true to size. Shirt ran small. The design was great. I liked the was it looked. Just not on me.
1.0,Was way too small !
1.0,i go a nice shirt but mot even close to the item i ordered
1.0,"Very beautiful pocket watch. Didn't feel inexpensive, but unfortunately right out of the box the second hand was stuck ticking in place and wouldn't move."
1.0,"Yes, the ruler shows the size in the ad but it still seems incredibly tiny in person.  Not appropriate for a slide, in my opinion.  It is overpriced for the size."
1.0,"They are pretty, but I can‚Äôt get them to stay in place to be a true climber earring. Defeats the purpose."
1.0,After for wearing for about an hour...they totally lose their stretch. Have to hold them up with my my hands! Totally unuseable
1.0,"Waste of money, I know know the importance of polarized sunglasses"
1.0,What is the contact number for your company ? Jacket fits but pants are way to small in the waist
1.0,"fell apart as soon as I barley tied it 3 of them feel apart immediately ,"
1.0,"They aren't oversized. They don't cover my husband's glasses, but they did fit over mine."
1.0,These fit rather loose so it displaces the breast shields.
1.0,"I was very disappointed with this purchase.  I bought 2 chains,  one was broken on arrival and both were very cheap looking."
1.0,Doesn't look like the product you are advertising. It is not 18k gold either. Attorney General and BBB will be notified.
1.0,Not exactly what I expected. Kinda boxy looking and that Ian not what I was going for.
1.0,"Was wayyyyyyyyy too big, was for a 3 month old $ it could have fit a 2 year old. It was also super cheap fabric & see through"
1.0,This could have been a great shirt but that faux layered hem at the bottom looks wonky ‚Äî¬†especially because this is a lightweight knit. The fabric is thinner (not see through) so the fake layered look just doesn't make sense. I'll be returning it.
1.0,"We bought these to use with our youth kids, and the flags were too small to fit around 90% of the kids. Which is ridiculous because none of them are very big at all. We tied them around our arms instead or held them in our hands. The actual flag part is cheaply sown to a velcro latch that gets put on the belt and it is so horribly sown that after one game of capture the flag, most of them were ripped from the velcro pieces. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND, especially for the cost. They are not good quality at all."
1.0,The band snapped the first time my wife put it on!
1.0,Beautiful but stone came off first time wearing simply opening a drawer and lightly touched to top of drawer. Disappointing
1.0,it was broke when I opened the package. I put it in the trash.
1.0,"Ordered the clear ones, was excited too. Received a pair of black glasses, too small. Disappointed."
1.0,"These do not look like gradient lens glasses because  the bottom of the lens is still VERY dark, so they look solid tint.<br />Disappointing because otherwise they are nice, comfortable glasses"
1.0,These shoes did not even last a month. They started peeling the second day he wore them and continued to get worse.
1.0,The description of this dress says it is cotton. It is not! It's 100% polyester. Big disappointment.
1.0,"Deceptive photo. I just received today, 10/22/15, and the ears are 1/2 yhe size pictured and the tail is 8&#34; long. It's headband barely covered my head. The proportions are for an 8 year old girl!!!!  Buyer beware. Why the previous reviewers didn't mention this is beyond my comprehension."
1.0,"They came in 2 colors, black and hideous green. Not what I thought I ordered at all! Yuck!"
1.0,Disappointed! It's so cheap lookingüòû
1.0,"horrible product , very thin and see through , will not be ordering again."
1.0,It was so tight on my eyelids that I couldn‚Äôt open them and my nose was pushed flat to the point of looking like a pug. Sending them back.
1.0,The stitching of the EGA is horrendous and the size albeit adjustable is still wrong.
1.0,"I love the design, but I completely forgot about my last experience with Geox high-tops. Even with the zipper I cannot get my son's foot in. So disappointed....really wanted these to work."
1.0,An anklet is made to be worn in summer weather conditions.  I loved the look of this so much and it fit perfect...and then I wore it.  After it's first exposure to sweat and sunscreen it tarnished and ended up dying the white string rust colored and left rust and green marks on my skin.  Not worth the money unless you only ever wear it in air conditioning.
1.0,I've never worn XL pants and these things are still way too small. Very tight and short. Nothing like the pictures.
1.0,"Dress is super cute, but it arrived with a hole in the seam attaching the sleeve to the body and a hole in the pocket. I didn‚Äôt discover it until after the return period."
1.0,Cheap item. It stained my skin.
1.0,Fake pocket. Returned
1.0,"The fabric is disgusting! Cold, slimy and thick. Smelled like chemicals. Absolutely would not wear this."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy this if you have a bigger chest, it was completely see through at the top of the dress comfy but tight on top."
1.0,Was not impressed with this shirt at all.
1.0,Gloves are not true to size. They are way too big for a medium. Gloves reas Mediun but are more like a large
1.0,"size is way off, and quality very poor"
1.0,Purchased this top because many women in my mom's group were getting it so that we could match each other. I put it on and my skin immediately began to itch. I would not recommend this product. I took it off shortly after grabbing a picture so that I could show I wore my shirt.
1.0,Did not include the whole costume and was unopened. Missing mask and wings. What a scam.
1.0,Was so excited to finally purchase these. My husband installed and I had them for one day then one came off. üò¢
1.0,I am sorry to say that the watch stopped working the first week.
1.0,I want a refund. I'm stunned this dress passed quality control. These seams are all messed. Including photos cause im literally laughing at how off every seam is. I bought this to wear to my sister's wedding. Thats gonna be a no yall.
1.0,"Only rated this a one star because you can't select &#34;0&#34;.  Watches doesn't keep time even after setting and resetting. Long lead time between order and delivery.  Horrible, cheap, crappy watch! Don't waste your money!!!"
1.0,"I lost nearly every single ball for this cheap jewelry. They‚Äôve fallen off, leaving the cylindrical attatchement that they are mounted on to screw onto the spiral. Seriously. Don‚Äôt buy this. Get a better product. I‚Äôve taken them out and went back to my labrets after switching to the horseshoes with the red shiny balls, and they same thing happened to them within DAYS of putting Them in. Also, I got sent two left hand spirals, and I could never get them looking right or turned the right way no matter how I twisted them. Never again will I buy a product fo put in my skin especially around my mouth and ears, on Amazon. Thanks for the lesson learned üòä"
1.0,"This is the worst  purchase  I have ever made.  It was sent from  Kentucky  (according to the label)  and  has a awful odor.  I am sure that the sweater was saved in a basement. Smells like a mold. I washed 3 times and still smells.  Also, it is a very poorly made. Unfortunately, because of my job schedule I can not return it. It will go straight to garbage..."
1.0,Came orange :(
1.0,Blue color stained my hands unpacking the hat. Not well made.
1.0,You get what you paid for. Very cheap looking. Was only able to wear one once before the golden fade out
1.0,this watch broke 5 days after i received it took it to watch shop to adjust band
1.0,"It is made in China.  I am terribly allergic to the sun.  I want USA made, and worst is no sun protection at all.  Hate it"
1.0,I opened the package and pieces of the necklace fell off.
1.0,I was very disappointed in this watch. I bought it for my son for Christmas. And it pretty much just fell apart and stopped working. I would not recommend this watch to anyone. If you noticed the second hand fell off the minute hand is extremely loose it's just poor workmanship.
1.0,Received them broken. Returned them and got my money bk
1.0,Only for a child‚Äôs head. Way to small. Cheap quality I returned
1.0,to small by far need to let folks know will keep but very close.
1.0,"They were the correct size.  3 packages.<br />Opening the first package, all the enclosed briefs had a perfect dime size hole in the seat.<br />Opening the second package, all of the briefs had round black circles the size of a pencil eraser all over them.  Looked intentional and similar size.  ODD!<br />I didn't open the third package.  I returned them."
1.0,Material eont last a day
1.0,It also faded with one wash. But most importantly the diagonal snaps and the lack of full opening down each side do not make these a best choice for shoulder surgery patients.
1.0,Delayed review. I bought this in November and pulled it out of the box christmas eve to wear and its garbage. Bluetooth does not work at all. DO NOT RECOMMEND WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS.
1.0,SCAM!!!!!!
1.0,"Turned my nose green after one day, ‚Äúrose gold‚Äù coating faded after the second day and was hard to remove. Do not buy , not steel."
1.0,"I bought this for my prom, however it did not meet the length requirement and it was striped in the worst way possible. Waste of money."
1.0,The material frays after a short use and breaks about six months after use. It looks ok but you can tell right off that the material is cheap
1.0,This is sized to fit a child and has this sparkly silver accent thread that is not pictured. the lace and beading was nice and the strips the beads were on was nice too. just too small and unwanted silver.
1.0,"These are very expensive flip flops. I got mine because I have plantar fascitis and wanted something with more cushion and support than my Olukai's, which I love. They feel great, but I have had them less than a week and they are already toast. Was playing ping pong with my son and took a step forward and the strap snapped. I have had Reefs and Olukai's and done basically everything with them and never had this happen. Not worth it for the money if you have to treat them like roller skates."
1.0,Love this purse but have been using it for a month and it‚Äôs falling apart! I hope the seller contacts me so I can return.
1.0,The bag is of poor quality and a foul smell.
1.0,Was much larger than it appears and paint was already chipped. Chain is uneven and uncomfortable. Very unhappy with this purchase
1.0,"I never even got to wear it! I charged it but it kept cutting off and on, wouldn't set! Fortunately, the seller responded quickly and I've already received a refund. Don't buy this one, it's not good!"
1.0,"The hands were falling off in this pic. I shall be requesting a refund, an upgrade or both. As this was bought as a gift for my boyfriend."
1.0,"What a HUNK OF JUNK!!!!!!! The description says &#34;Constructed of sturdy, durable, shiny chrome that makes your message POP. Constructed of chromed steel.<br />Images are applied with a permanent adhesive weatherproof decal. UV and water-resistant.&#34;<br /><br />The frame itself is in fact sturdy (metal?), but the image is not at all what you would expect from the description. It's just two stickers sloppily stuck into the frame. Every corner of the stickers were coming up when I took the frame out of the mailing material. There is nothing permanent about the attachment of the stickers to the frame, or professional for that matter, and zero weather resistance to boot. Unfortunately it is not an amazon prime item, but at the $16 price point plus the $4.99 shipping I will definitely be getting at least some money back on this because it is NOT going on my vehicle. I am SO DISAPPOINTED"
1.0,Es un robo ni es si quiera para la patita de un perro que horror deber√≠a n devolver el dinero pues esto no es es un fraude
1.0,"The crowns came with one long string of ribbon not an elastic band, and the crowns didn't have any holes to feed the ribbon through in order to wear them as a hat. Also when assembled the crowns did no sit evenly. They were really cute and the perfect amount of sparkle but I had to return them because there was no way I could have used them as hats."
1.0,"Feels, smells, and looks cheap, like something from the swap meet. At most its worth $5. On the shoulders, the shirt rises and its flared up. Definitely not a masculine look. I purchased a small and felt like a small so the sizing is correct."
1.0,Thing doesn‚Äôt even work it acts like it‚Äôs going to blow up. Not happy need to return but don‚Äôt have the box.
1.0,"the hat is not deep enough to get in and stay in the head therefore seats high up in the head and falls out. horribly made, i didn't realize it because i didn't use it until few months after i purchase it."
1.0,"The picture shows the emblem small and In  the middle of scarf. Not so!  The emblem covered most of the scarf and was too stiff and heavy for the yarn of the scarf. Scarf  was also overly long, could have fold in half and wore like a regular scarf ."
1.0,Says pin set there was one pin
1.0,Already  broke
1.0,"The design of the top is cute,  the picture that you see....is not what you will get. The color is much lighter and the stitching is different. So for that I give it a 1 star"
1.0,This is a size small-NOT xxl!<br />The waste band won‚Äôt wven fit one of my legs<br />Should‚Äôve read more reviews<br />DO NOT order this unless you are short and very thin!
1.0,This was tiny. Barely big enough for a doll. Waste of money!
1.0,Literally took them out of the package and one of the lenses fell out.  Geez!
1.0,"I do not recommend, if you want to return any dresses they want you to return the dresses to China. They tried to talk me into keeping the dress which I did not want because it was too small! It has been nothing but a nightmare dealing with this company! The quality of the dress was not bad but the return was a nightmare!"
1.0,I expected more to this bracelet then what it was for the cost.  Very over priced
1.0,"color hideous, awful, threw them out"
1.0,Too large. Colors are dull. The material is so thin it's almost see-through. Not what I expected at all.
1.0,Won't purchase again. Smaller than expected. One pair came broke
1.0,"Cheaply made watch, broke 2 weeks after intermittent wear."
1.0,Order the Wine color. It is more pink than wine/red/burgundy.
1.0,"The quality is pretty good but the bags are tiny, way too tiny!<br />I specifically bought those for my hiking boots (as advertised) and I have to struggle to fit one shoe per bag.<br />This is pretty useless as I do not see the point of having two separate bags for your shoes.<br />I guess they would work OK for flip flops or sandals...."
1.0,"THE CUTESt BRACELET!<br />BUT every single one of the chains was such an awkward size it wouldn't just stay on my arm! It slides and catches on everything! After wearing it about three times, two chains came off with almost no force applied! I understand its cheap, but you're paying for more than this is worth! I ended up cutting off all the chains and hooking sturdier chains to the top antlers creating an AWESOME necklace. That is the only thing i would have someone buy this for is to make other jewelry with it. PIECE OF CRAP! But not too much money was spent, so lesson learned."
1.0,"I bought this after carefully reviewing the size chart.  Despite that, the sizing is completely off.  The jacket fits, for the most part, but the pants and the shirt are both approximately 3 sizes too small.  It's almost like I was sent the wrong sizes in those two garments but the right size jacket.  I think it's too late to return this, otherwise I'd definitely be sending it back.  Also, the ""sweater"" vest isn't actually a sweater--it's just printed on cheap fabric.  Honestly, avoid this costume at all costs.  AWFUL."
1.0,"Like the material, BUT, the cap isn‚Äôt round as shown in the picture. It sits higher and the corners are pointy."
1.0,Quality not as pictured. Looks cheap.
1.0,I have tried to adjust them to stay.  They keep falling like a dangling earring.
1.0,"Purchased one for my wife for Christmas , vest didn't work so I returned and replaced, received second one and after a full charge doesn't have much heat not even remotely Hot at top setting. Very Disappointed, desperately wanted it to work wife loved the concept but unfortunately its going back as well."
1.0,What the f  is this! This my freakin order! Really come on people. Be nice!
1.0,"Please take a look to what I received. 5 lanyards they said, I ended up receiving 1 functional one. Total garbage though. Do not buy. Had to mark a star, but only to send this review. No stars for this purchase."
1.0,"The shirt was much much smaller than expected. I ordered a 3XL and this wouldn't even fit my daughter who wears a misses medium. I would say the 3XL was closer to a juniors medium. There were a lot of strings coming off the shirt so I don't think the quality was very good, although I did not even try it on and it's a very inexpensive shirt. It is very pretty and would have looked nice under a black jacket to wear to work. I was very disappointed at how small it was."
1.0,"I bought the golden yellow double ruffle version and it's thin, cheaply made, and unattractive in person. The color is not the same as online. I returned it. Also it seemed as if it was too much material."
1.0,"The fabric seems to be okay but the print is so bad, I just have to return it.  City people in the third world will refuse to wear this even as a pajama shirt."
1.0,These are cute pants but not the quality I was expecting. I'm accustomed to a thicker fabric in Chino-style pants. I returned them.
1.0,"Not satisfied with the product or the seller, poor customer service.<br />Thin shirt, felt like pjs, not a shirt my husband would wear."
1.0,Stitching has already started to come unravelled..... Super disappointed
1.0,got my 13 year old this for halloween.. wires broke after a few mins. we fixed them and than it broke again after hanging on for 1 min
1.0,Very small. Material was scratchy. Padding was terrible. No support.
1.0,Buckle does not fit through belt loops. Nice idea. Poor execution. Buckle needs to be smaller.
1.0,It‚Äôs practically a crop top...it needs little more length.
1.0,These are warm and comfortable however the shirt stitching came apart after one wash. Not a fan of cheaply made products. I would recommend a different brand.
1.0,Earrings are poorly made. Does not look the same as Ad pictures. Very disappointed that they only allow you to return it after 1 day.
1.0,I did not like the material and it came with a huge hole in the pocket.
1.0,"It was marked XXL, which I ordered, but fit like a M.  Terrible.  Now I have to hastle sending it back."
1.0,"Its not just too small, its hilariously too small.  I should have taken a photo before I donated it."
1.0,"It was perfect for my use, but the strap broke on the 2nd use."
1.0,They broke very easily‚Ä¶ poorly made unfortunately. Sad because I got compliments on them
1.0,It wouldnt fit my watch and when trying to return it the cost of returning it cost almost more then $5.00 waste of money.
1.0,This hat was very small and did not fit so I had to return it.
1.0,Worst quality ever. Threads came apart after one wash.
1.0,Does not match the listing. The colors are basically sheer. Not happy.
1.0,This does not look good on my ear at all. I also ordered the gold one but it came looking like the gold was rubbed off.
1.0,The material is decent but the sleeves are very long and the torso is very short. Say goodbye to lifting your arms at all. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
1.0,"Not a women‚Äôs large more like a youth medium. 5‚Äô8 140lbs and not able to fit this large. Very disappointing in the sizing. I would order 2 sizes up if you order this. Other than that, it‚Äôs cute and comfy in the 5 minutes I could wear it"
1.0,The material is weird. It‚Äôs like a bathing suit material. It‚Äôs comfortable but different... I wouldn‚Äôt buy again. For the cost I expected it to be better.
1.0,Wayyyy too small!
1.0,Hi . My friend told me abt these great bags for on te go..being the type that likes things organized and easy I purchased your le sac bags..after taking them on an overnight trip I was disappointed  to see that two of them tore along the seems ..and one zipper broke..i was expecting better wear and tear..thanks
1.0,"I ordered this despite the mixed reviews and I really regret it. I was aware it ran small according to other reviews so I went crazy and ordered a 5XL. It came and I was super excited because it seemed ok quality (not great but just ok). Put it on and I successfully recreated the ""fat man in a little coat"" scene from Black Sheep. I then gave it to my wife who wears a MEDIUM and the 5XL was to small even for her. Just plain don't buy this. Not worth the hassle, I promptly returned it."
1.0,Tiny is an understatement. Would have been petfect for smsll child if backs weren`t so long.
1.0,"Too large, so I returned it."
1.0,"Loved the look, wore the band 2 time and it broke!  I was so sad I had waited weeks and then to just wear it twice was such a let down :("
1.0,So disappointed! My granddaughter wore it once and the readjustable plastic buckle snapped!
1.0,Looks NOTHING like what's is the description picture. Material is uncomfortable and fits odd. Not for me.
1.0,I had requested a return label‚Ä¶due to jacket too big<br />Had to contact Amazon‚Ä¶they were very helpful and contacted business<br /><br />Their reply is they would give me a credit if I kept the jacket and give it to someone‚Ä¶.I asked what the credit would be‚Ä¶.NO REPLY
1.0,Did not fit to size Did not fit to size
1.0,Very disappointed with this purchase! Not a single barbell matches the ones I  the picture. All I received was a pack with a bunch of duplicates with the same 4 colors
1.0,I will never get screw together plugs again!!! The moon got stuck in my ear and had to use 2 sets of pliers to get off!!!! Damaging my ear and plug in the process!!
1.0,The comfort was ok. the sturdiness was not there. It was too big
1.0,I gave this dress 1 star because it was firstly too big and the measurements were very off. The material and everything else just looked cheap.
1.0,Very cheap material does not keep you warm it is not Valore it said that it‚Äôs velour but when you have real Valore you know there is a complete difference between this and real material. The inner lining is ridiculous.
1.0,It is just a thin t shirt not worth the money  I can get a pack of T-shirts six in a packs for $20
1.0,that item is not as it seems  poor  quailty and  seller is  refunds very difficult . I gave up
1.0,Returned immediately. Flimsy material. Looks nothing like picture.
1.0,Large is more like a small.
1.0,Color nice. It looked much bigger in picture.
1.0,Poor quality fabric. Weirdly tight sleeves.
1.0,I typically order large but ordered XL to be safe. Item seemed like it was made for a 6 foot twelve year old. The torso area was incredibly too small. Especially since I was under the impression I bought this in the plus size section. The material seemed very thin. It was completely see through. It was as if somebody took a flag and sewed it into a dress for tall twelve year old girls. Defiantly NOT what I expected. The picture and description is very decieveing.
1.0,"Really a bad product,<br />the strap is not good quality.<br />The buckle keeps opening up itself even after locking it.<br />I thought to use on Oris aquis.<br />I changed it back to original strap and dumped this belt to dustbin."
1.0,"The size is accurate, and the material is quality feel."
1.0,You guys put a real close up picture.  It‚Äôs so tiny it looks like a children‚Äôs jewelry
1.0,Even being 38 weeks pregnant this dress in a size small fit too big.
1.0,The item itself looks great but the chain is paper thin I don't think it's a good match since the pearl is heavy definitely not the one in the picture
1.0,Dont waste your money!
1.0,Looker way to tight and hot for adult head
1.0,Online it‚Äôs a different color. At home it looked like a wrong turn mask.
1.0,I only received 50 blue masks not the whole prder
1.0,way too big for me the sholders strips very loose.. bad fit
1.0,"Cheaply made, flimsy. Would not suggest purchasing."
1.0,So the shirt itself fits really nice and the material feels really thick but not hot. But after the first use and wash. It has started to come undone from the seams all over the shirt. I bought both of the color options and the other one did the same. I feel like they're really expensive for them to be doing this. I also bought one of the Hawaiian shirts and now I'm nervous that it will do the same.
1.0,Not 925 cause it turned my girlfriends finger green Also the stone fell out 2 days of wearing it
1.0,When I opened the package it smelled of strong chemicals. The shirt was really stiff.  I immediately put it in the sink to hand wash it and the water turned black. I rinsed it over and over and the water stayed black. I would be afraid to wear this!
1.0,Hate them. They are way too small and have poor quality.
1.0,"The shirt felt soft and nice color, but the lettering is of poor quality.<br />Returned item, refunded money minus shipping charges."
1.0,Started leaking after one use! Had it less than an month. My son is so upset about it. Definitely a waste of money!
1.0,Cheap flimsy materials.
1.0,I owned this for a few months and the pin holding the clip in place fell out and my keys fell on the floor in my office. I‚Äôm just lucky this happened near my desk and not over a grate on a NYC street
1.0,"I loved this dress initially, but I washed it in cold cycle and then dried it on low heat only to have it shrink to the size of a shirt. It seems like everything needs to be hang dried this day of fast-fashion and cheap fabric. What a mistake this purchase was. I wish I could return it or get a refund."
1.0,"If you would like an infuriating way of putting a watch band on, then by all means by this. It doesn't have a buckle that you would slide the other velcro part through, it is just a basically double sided piece of velcro. Have fun with this especially if you have limited hand mobility. absolutely a garbage product."
1.0,"Nice color (orange)and my son says they are very comfortable.<br />  Update...the 2nd time my son wore these they tore.  I was able to exchange them very easily.  Sadly the new pair we received came out of the washing machine with tears in the same exact places...unfortunately when I tried to return them again I discovered that the return ""window"" is based on the original order date so basically we're out of luck.  I think it's safe to say that since both pairs tore in the exact same spots there is a defect.  I'm very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend."
1.0,not a leather band
1.0,"It is very warm, however the Pom poms first on top came off then the left on and I had to take off the right one."
1.0,"Didnt survive it first trip to cabo, so sad :("
1.0,"I don't believe these are actually stainless steel. I am sensitive to different metals. Stainless steel is one of the few that I can tolerate. I had a reaction to these. I am returning them for a refund. Have already started the return. They are having me ship them back. Pretty frightening! Sure hope they don't sell to someone else. I've worn them! I can't believe they are paying for shipping to return an item that should not be re-sold.<br /><br />Dear Amazon, please don't resale them! That's horrifying!"
1.0,Not comfortable at edges where very rough.
1.0,"Do Not waste your money on this thing!!  I can't even call it a hat. The photos are totally deceiving!!! Its like a play hat, for a little girls dolls or stuffed animals!! I can not believe I bought this. It comes all rolled up and squished. It Smells like barbie furniture. The hat part that goes on top of your head/hair, is made of thin, flimsy plastic and the hat doesn't even fit or stay on your head!! It just slips right off the top of your head!!! You literally can not keep it on top of your head. Its a total peice of crap! I couldn't get this thing returned fast enough... it arrived and withing 1 hour after opening it, I was already driving down to return it."
1.0,"Horrible, to small and had it on for 3hrs and started to fray!! 5'0 &198lbs ordered XL"
1.0,Too flimsy.  Nothing like the San Diego Hat Co. hats.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"Buyer Beware, Very Disappointed;<br />I showed my husband this watch in hopes that he would get it for me for Christmas. I thought the price point was good. I was so happy when I received this as a gift for Christmas, I absolutely LOVE the design/style and overall color of this watch. There weren't any reviews at the time (prior to my husband purchasing it), so it was really anyone's best guess on the quality, pro's, & con's. As soon as it was removed from the box I seen that I would need to adjust the band as it was huge! So as I looked at the band I seen the band links weren't/aren't removable. The only adjustable portion is on the clasp which still left the band very large and loose. It actually needs to be 2-3 inches smaller before it will stop sliding off my wrist all together. So now I have a glorified paperweight. If you are thinking about buying this watch my advice is; 1) only buy it if you have shrek wrists, or if you want a new paperweight. 2) if you like this style look at other brands/sellers, fossil has a similar one on Amazon for about $100. Granted that's just over double but fossil is well known and uses adjustable bands. I would've returned it but my husband couldn't find the receipt/order information that came with it."
1.0,"Mask is nice and big.  However, I thought I would be getting two."
1.0,I ordered a size up and it's still too small
1.0,It's too large I ordered L and got XL
1.0,Very cheaply made. I returned it right away.
1.0,"I want to give this product zero stars. The sizing on these pants is not ""as described."" I usually wear size 10-12 jeans. Amazon recommended that I buy size LARGE. I was looking for comfortable, lounging in the chair and reading a book pants... so I bought XL. The pants fit my size 0-2 daughter.... not me."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:37ad340d4016dda9840f034ee99a0137]] came damaged
1.0,Way to big. I ordered a medium and got an XL  companys fault
1.0,Very poor fit felt b like they were in backwards but weren't!
1.0,Horrible material doesn‚Äôt fit way to small
1.0,"States 8 pieces, you will get 4 drawstrings, and 2 pieces to pull it through, even that is only 6.  Fraud/Lies<br />gets no stars"
1.0,to bad
1.0,Foggy up when you breathe.  Useless at keep germs in or out.
1.0,"This product IS NOT AS PICTURED! The fabric is cheap, and there is only color on ONE SIDE of the fabric!! It‚Äôs white on the inside. Avoid!!!"
1.0,"I got these for my son and after being at the pool for 15 mins, they already have a very large hole in them. They were in a million pieces by the end of our pool outing."
1.0,Very cheaply made wont last long.. not happy
1.0,"Overpriced and innacurate picture. If they aren't sold by the pair, maybe use a single gauge in your picture. Gauge was also covered in black lint. Can't even send out a clean item."
1.0,The shirt was described to have glitter<br />This shirt had no glitter
1.0,During a workout it turned my skin the color of the bra!
1.0,Hard to close. Not comfortable
1.0,Broke the first time I tried to wear it
1.0,these are not leather and the straps are some cheap material which you have to hold to get on your feet then they are so big the straps poor fit and reprenstation
1.0,"This is my 4th pair of these sandals -- I love, love, love the fit.  However, my new pair must have been made by a different supplier -- they were made in Vietnam and my previous pairs were made in China.  My new pair (made in Vietnam) has a different material for the straps and the piece that goes between the toes.  When they get wet (for instance if I am out watering the garden), the black dye runs and stains my feet.  I mean really stains.  I've tried everything to remove the black stains from my feet -- scrubbing with soap, cleanser, nail polish remover.  After a week, the stains are finally fading.  I'll be returning these sandals, alas.<br /><br />In the past, I've also had trouble with the sandals stretching out after a year or so of constant wear.  Also the piece between the toes has sometimes broken on my previous pairs, but this was after many months of wear.  In my opinion, this was acceptable after many months of constant use.  However, the non-waterproof black dye on my brand new pair is completely unacceptable."
1.0,Don't buy. If you decide to purchase be sure to purchase two sizes larger an still the arms will probably not be adequate
1.0,No es el mismo zapato de la imagen.
1.0,Product came damaged. Very disappointing. Cheap material used
1.0,Nice looking watch. Too bad it could not last a month.
1.0,I had to take 6 inches in on each side......even though I followed the measurement chart
1.0,These are awful.  I have other viv collection Capri leggings that are buttery soft. These are sheer and as scratchy as the little white tights we use to have to wear on Easter 50 years ago.
1.0,"I should have verified this size, because this is more like a child's sized bracelet."
1.0,Good on me
1.0,"Total cheat! Not iridescent at all not even ""holographic!"" Looks like they took a photo of something iridescent and then spam printed an apron from it. Then on top of it they changed the sale images!"
1.0,Not enough support after liposuction surgery
1.0,Dress is very nice but way too short
1.0,This jumpsuit is made out of really crappy material and the straps in the back just twist up and don‚Äôt lay flat like the pictures show. The material doesn‚Äôt even look like what is pictured. I even bought the same outfit in a different rand thinking that it might be different but it wasn‚Äôt.
1.0,"Regret buying this cheap dress. It‚Äôs see through and I think it would better for a pool day. I can‚Äôt wear it in public, too cheap looking"
1.0,Returned runs way to small
1.0,CHEAP PLASTIC  AND FUNNY LOOKING.
1.0,These fit really weird below the knee. They are loose.
1.0,They don't fit my glasses frame properly and are not as thick as the originals. I wish there had been more information about this in the product description!
1.0,"This is a cheaply made blouse, the fabric is thin and the cut is poor. It looks way better in the picture. Will be returning!"
1.0,"The size was xs, I ordered XXL"
1.0,Not float at all like picture shows. I ordered a size up and it's still small.
1.0,I have never seen this before.  I washed the underwear before wearing.  I wore them.  After sometime I decided to use the toilet.  The dye from the underwear transferred from my butt to the toilet seat. It took 1/2 hour to get the dye off the toilet seat plus getting it off by butt.  I called customer service as well as live chat with customer service.  They don‚Äôt sell these anymore and told me to return to seller. I have other Spyder products.  They are so much better quality.  Don‚Äôt buy these.
1.0,The buckles broke off with in minutes‚Ä¶.
1.0,"The keychain is plastic. The ring itself and the hardware. I bought it as a gift, but would be embarrassed to give it. I will be returning this item. 2nd return out of hundreds of purchases. I am not picky, but this thing is total trash. Leather.... NOT. Don‚Äôt waist your coin!!"
1.0,Cheap and look cheap.  Seems like gold paint rather than metal.
1.0,I normally wear a S/M I ordered a large because of the reviews.  The tank was tight fitting and the scoop neck was extremely low.
1.0,"I ordered two pairs of these glasses and neither came as described. One were the green gradient pair which were NOT polarized and came with scratches on the lenses as well as bite marks on the plastic. The brown pair had no gradient even though they were advertised as having a gradient in the pictures. Take your business elsewhere, there is no care or attention to detail in this product."
1.0,"Everything about these are bad- the texture, the fit and the cone shape it gives to your chest.  Do not recommend."
1.0,These do not consistently work.  I almost lost a $3k diamond stud earring using these ‚Äòlocking‚Äô backs.  The only reason I didn‚Äôt lose the earring is because I had worn it with the original back and then this  behind it.
1.0,"Muy bonito, pero en la primer puesta se trozo, mala calidad o venia defectuoso"
1.0,ive had this watch for 1 1/2 months and it allready looses 3 hrs over a 24 hr day!!!! GARBAGE!!! TOTAL TRASH!!!
1.0,Bought it for my niece..the first day she wore it the sweet 16 charm broke off. Cheap !
1.0,They're ok. Just extremely cheap looking. I should've known though.
1.0,Really disappointed with the purchase process. This was a gift for Mother‚Äôs Day that arrived after Father‚Äôs Day.
1.0,A lot smaller then it looks. It might work for a little kid
1.0,"I was very excited about these pants and wore them immediately. Upon removing them the same night I noticed that the stitching in the butt area was uneven and would obviously split open and any time. I would love to exchange them as I love the color and the fit but do not have a printer currently. Very, very disappointed.<br /><br />Also ordered a black pair and the stitching seems perfect on them."
1.0,"My goodness! The SMELL! I received these in July 2017 and they reeked before opening the individual packs. I sealed them up to deal with them later. Today, I tackled this nauseating task... gloves, goggles and a respirator kept me from gagging. One oyster was just petrified liquid, the others were ok. There's a good biology lesson in the parasites on the shells.<br /><br />I can't recommend these for kids unless you are prepared for the horror show.<br /><br />The pearls are fine, I didn't expect gem quality at this price anyway."
1.0,Just saying
1.0,"Pretty in the picture, it looks average when your wearing it."
1.0,"The bracelet was okay, the color was fading into brown and began to tarnish. Also, the barbell on the bracelet was HUGE. It bothered me because it stuck out a lot."
1.0,Soooo wide. They don‚Äôt stay on
1.0,Material was horrible and fit was not right
1.0,Looks nothing as advertised
1.0,I received them with out a button to and the zipper broke when I tried to zip them before even trying them on. I want my money back
1.0,These are okay cuffs do not hold up for adult play
1.0,"Unfortunately not a good material for me , Good color , cheap cut"
1.0,"NOT as described.  This is 95% cotton not modal as stated in the description.  They are very thin, see through and unacceptable for even yoga.  Returned."
1.0,Poor quality. Broke within the first hour I had it. Chain came out of the socket.<br />I know this wasn't a very expensive glasses holder but it shouldn't have broken so quickly & easily.
1.0,"Bought these for my parent‚Äôs international trip hoping that they would be durable enough to withstand the airplane and bus that they‚Äôd be taking while abroad. These did not withstand their domestic flight, given I understand it depends on who is handling the luggage but you‚Äôd think they would get this dinged up. Pretty disappointed with this purchase, don‚Äôt quite think it‚Äôs worth the price if you‚Äôre going to be flying with these, may be better if you‚Äôre traveling by car and are handling them on your own."
1.0,These belts have a metal clasp that is used to adjust the length that pokes you in the back and will scratch your seats in your car or any furniture you sit on.
1.0,Not what I expected! Top cushions are very uncomfortable and the bottom runs small.
1.0,"Full of flaws, nicks, scratches. Item was returned"
1.0,Huge sunglasses on the side. For big heads
1.0,The color chips off of them after 1 use
1.0,Didn't get to wear these beauties unfortunately. broken on arrival.
1.0,It's a kids watch will not go around wrist
1.0,This band does not fit a gear sport watch.  I plan to return it to the manufacturer.  I purchased because they said this was compatible it is not!
1.0,Do not care for this product. The sole is thick and clunky. More like a slip on outdoor shoe than slipper for inside.
1.0,"Horrible smell and is not a blanket scarf. The images that are shown as a shawl wouldn't be possible with this product. While the product is long, the width is short and shouldn't be noted as 'blanket'. The smell is not OK. Not sure if this is due to where it's manufactured but my friend ordered one the same day as I did and her's stinks as well. I do not recommend this if your looking for a blanket scarf!"
1.0,It started flaking off within 15 or 20 minutes I would not recommend this product at all.
1.0,"These 2 pairs of biking/yoga shorts are not a &#34;2 for 1&#34; at all. They are not even made for the same purposes!  It's as though this company had a stack of shorts that were in great demand, and a stack of shorts that virtually NO ONE wanted....so they hatched the idea of &#34;hey, let's unload these crappy pairs as a 2-for-1 with the pairs that are already selling, and upcharge what people are paying for the single pair!!&#34;..... *whuan whaun whaun*..... I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER HAVE PAID $16 FOR JUST ONE PAIR OF A KNOCKOFF BRAND OF NYLON SHORTS, but that is unfortunately exactly what I have done.  :( :( :(<br />Basically, the pink pair is actually the 12&#34; mini pair as advertised, but the neon yellow pair is the 10&#34; micro size. The length of the pink pair is the only good thing I can say about that pair. It has a flimsy waistband that is easily 2&#34; larger than the neon yellow pair (that would be 2&#34; unstretched, lying flat), and there's no &#34;compression&#34; effect with the pink pair -- therefore all off the cuffs/bands roll up as soon as you begin any movement.<br />***AND NOTE*** These mismatched shorts DO NOT help with the chub rub !!!! There is no control factor with these. I am 5'3&#34; and 138 lbs. so my chub rub is not exactly &#34;excessive,&#34; but these shorts are of no use. If you are looking for a pair of shorts to be worn with the primary purpose of preventing your thighs from rubbing together, this is not the product to get !!!!<br />On the positive side, the colors are true to the listing photos, and the shorts are not as sheer as most due to the 90/10 nylon factor.<br /> I am posting several pictures I took of these immediately after opening the package....you be the judge."
1.0,VERY poor construction.
1.0,The color pink was totally not the one shown in pictures. Neither is it distressed. The material is not sweatshirt and more a t shirt. Highly disappointed!
1.0,"The add says that the belt will fit a a person up to 49.6&#34; but the the belt will only fit a person up to 46&#34; thus making the belt worthless.<br />I also think you add is very miss leading,"
1.0,This product was not as described.. It looks like a slip you put under your dress... Will be returning
1.0,For a sports bra there was absolutely no support. It felt like I was putting on a tube top from the 80's that you were determined to fall out of.
1.0,Cheap material that shrunk to 2 sizes smaller than what I purchased. Would not rec
1.0,Poor overall quality poor customer service
1.0,Very poor quality.  I could not give it as a gift.
1.0,"Sadly, these are way too heavy."
1.0,Didnt help
1.0,"This item is ridiculously, horribly undersized. I cannot stress enough how small this thing is. The material is some type of thin synthetic material, NOT cotton."
1.0,"What you get IS NOT THIS SKIRT, you receive a sloppy made mimic."
1.0,Very cheaply made and extremely light. If I wore it it would probably slip off because even though I ordered my size it was too loose. Also looked more like a woman's ring.
1.0,A little small. I ordered a 2x. First washing the threads in the side seam unraveled. Not quality
1.0,"my daughter loves gymnastics, she was getting really bad blisters and saw all these cool girls wearing gloves. We decided to surprise her with these gloves. My daughter used them for one dat then said ""it makes my blister worse it just makes me lose my grip on the bar, not keep it."" so don't buy these gloves unless that is what you want."
1.0,Definitely not one size fits all. Ordered these for my wife that size large normally fits very well. These are sized more in the small to medium range.
1.0,Great Fit!<br />Material very itchy!<br />Returned order.
1.0,"Ordered a 9, got an 11. They smell awful and are terrible quality. Should have known better!"
1.0,Washed this once and hung it to dry but shrunk 2 sizes. It looks like it'll fit my 10 year old now.
1.0,This is nothing like what I thought it would be. Horrible Ugly material.........and print was so cheap and fake looking!!‚òπÔ∏è
1.0,"I ordered a similar sweater and saw this one and decided to add it as well. It was a little less expensive than the other one I purchased but the same style, different colors.<br />The other one was received and it is very nice. This one is an entirely different fabric. It reminds me of a sponge bob Halloween costume that we have. I am a little angry that someone sold this. It‚Äôs gross."
1.0,"I put these on all our bags at the start of our trip. Unfortunately, half of them have fallen off before we left our first destination. I was not able to return them for a refund because (1) we did not return from our trip within the return window and (2) I no longer have possession of some of the items because the item failed."
1.0,"The key chain is so fragile, I dropped my keys on the floor and it broke . It should be more durable"
1.0,"Wanted to like this. Zipper broke during first trip. Hanger hook keeps snagging internal netting, ripping the netting. It's a perfect size for my items, just not durable."
1.0,Hasn't been determined yet
1.0,"FABRIC IS LIKE PAPER, AND IT TORE BEFORE I WORE IT, NOT HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM."
1.0,"This is the absolute worst quality item, in general, I have ever received. There was hot glue still hanging from the headband, the wig is falling apart as I take it out of the bag, and the body suit feels so flimsy and not at all proportional. Definitely not worth $80, I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôd pay 10 for it‚Ä¶"
1.0,"Nearly every single pair was broken upon arrival. My fault for not checking in sooner, but now it‚Äôs too late to do anything about it"
1.0,"Bought this for my Graduating 8th Grader. Overall its beautiful, solid and the inscriptions is meaningful and in a delicate script design, but, the area around the Bangle is very sharp and it is too big!"
1.0,Mailed to Ferrari to replace watch band they said No. Ferrari did not step up and send a REPLACEMENT! The watch band broke in less then a year - do I really need to say anything else!
1.0,"NOT AT ALL AN AUTHENTIC UNIFORM! I am a hooters alumni girl, and the material is cheap, and the sizing is WAY OFF! I‚Äôm not as tiny as I was in my 20‚Äôs, so I got the large shirt and medium shorts and crossed my fingers and prayed they would fit SINCE hooters uniforms are made small. I got 2 sets, all black, and white/orange... they are HUGE! And if you are wanting to show some ‚Äúhooters‚Äù not a chance. The neck line is super high. Very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è Pretty sure this is made to fit a man..."
1.0,"This dress looks gorgeous online, but in person I was incredibly disappointed. I ordered a 3X because i'm pregnant and thought I would rather it be too big than too small. I am normally a 2X, and this dress was closer to a L. It was almost comical when I put it on. The polyester like material clung to me in ways that I never want to experience again. The sizing is not my only complaint, either. The floral print that is gorgeous on my computer screen came out of the bag as almost curtain like- it was ugly! Even if it had fit me, I would have returned it immediately. I'm very disappointed in this purchase and have started the return process."
1.0,Needs better quality control
1.0,I ordered a 2XL looking at the specificitions using the size chart  but when I opened the pkg it was very small . Not happy at all . Have to return
1.0,"Bought this for my daughter who was very excited to receive the Wednesday ""Raven Dance"" dress.  Unfortunately despite measuring her to order the right size, the dress was loo large.  Not only was the size off, the material was so itchy she didn't want another in the correct size.  Disappointingly poor quality considering the price of the dress."
1.0,Casing that holds strap pins broke! Through the damm watch away!!
1.0,This sweater came to small looks green instead of gray and it's see through very itchy material üò°üò°
1.0,The sticker peeled off plus it took like a month or longer to arrive.
1.0,Horribly transparent. Very cheap.
1.0,Poor quality. As stupid as it looks.
1.0,"NOT TRUE TO SIZE, Very uncomfortable ..."
1.0,terrible shape/sizing despite following the chart. felt like i was wearing a box of art deco
1.0,My shirt is cute however it smells like someone had it on and wears those stinky oils. I'm going to wash it and see if that smell comes out.....I think one of your employees is wearing clothes and putting them back
1.0,Sized larger then listed
1.0,Ped√≠ un par de zapatos y enviaron un cintur√≥n ..
1.0,I order a 3x and couldn't even start to close the pants.
1.0,"Easy to lose pieces, very difficult to put on by yourself"
1.0,"Had to return it.  It was my size, but the underarm holes were so small that I could not move my arms at all.  And I have thin arms."
1.0,Material is cheap looking
1.0,To small & also to short! Add my blue dress shirt 4 pick up !!
1.0,"I sized up to hopefully have a good fit in the top, the band was way too big and the cups were ridiculously small. Returned immediately."
1.0,"Very poor quality, wired plastic feel, cheap zipper, too small."
1.0,I wear lots of fitness tops but the pattern makes the fit look off or<br />Crooked.
1.0,Unfortunately it doesn't fit around my husbands luggage in a criss cross fashion so we had to cut the smaller half off. Disappointed
1.0,"Cheap but not so cheerful<br />*there's definitely a problem in the production process, whether the fabric is defective or just cheaply made.<br />*They are beyond cheaply made. Seams do not match either. The two stripes on the quad make me look like I had elephant thighs (I'm 5'6 130lb)."
1.0,The size is more like junior or child‚Äôs large. I wear 14-16 and the large might fit a friend of mine who wears a 0/2. They really need to resize these to American sizes. Complete waste of $50 because they don‚Äôt accept returns.
1.0,Snapped within a week. ):
1.0,"I wish this dress looked like the picture because I love the style.  Sadly, the fabric is wimpy and shapeless.  Not what I was looking for.  Returned."
1.0,"I couldn't wear this retainer for more than 10 minutes. The flat end is rough and it scraps, against the roof of your mouth. Do not recommend."
1.0,Way way too short ...but nice fabric and style
1.0,Medium size is TOO LARGE!! Had to send it back.
1.0,These are crap. I literally got them & threw them in the trash. Will not buy from this seller ever again. Jems fell out of base when I opened bag. So clearly won't stay in my Monroe piercing. My sign is NO my number is NO you need to let it go. Lol no no no.
1.0,"I wish I would have seen the &#34;runs small&#34; fit.<br />Look super comfy, but to small..<br />Pants string broke within days of a friend using them."
1.0,"This jacket looked really cute on the site, and I ordered up in size because I have broader shoulders than average and intended to tailor the waist to fit; however when the product arrived, I found it was too short to tailor.  I'm not even that large--a medium in most tops--and I wear supportive undergarments, but still the waist and chest were set so high that it was unwearable.  No way to tailor that, unfortunately."
1.0,"Do not like them at all , doesn‚Äôt stay on foot and they are supposed to be no show well they show with every shoe. I have ordered a lot of items from amazon that I‚Äôm not happy with at all and it‚Äôs impossible to return anything to amazon üò°"
1.0,"I wish I could say I loved these bras.  I ordered 2 of them.  While wearing, the hook moves and it ends up sideways so all the material is bunched up in the corner as shown in the picture.  The hook on the first one broke the 2nd time I wore it.  The second one, the edges on the hook were not smoothed out, and irritated my skin.  I had to wrap the hook in a kleenex to continue wearing it for the remainder of the day.  Would NOT recommend!"
1.0,Returning. Really cheap fabric - feels AWFUL!!
1.0,I returned this dress . Has no shape and the fabric was wrinkled and hard and see thru
1.0,"Looks like fleece, feels like fleece. Description says promising 50% cotton, 30% linen but hey, this item hasn't been even near cotton fields! The label in the shirt/dress says 60% cotton 35% polyester. Blurry photo together with misleading description. Sizing is off too; XXL is more like tight L or even M."
1.0,"this item has no support & i am not going to return it, too much trouble<br />dissatisfied"
1.0,"The fit was good ,the material is very shiny so it showed every lump and bump ( like semi gloss paint on an old wall ).returning  not for me ."
1.0,"Although these were great quality, the sizing was WAY OFF!!! I wear a size 16 so I ordered and XL. It would have fit maybe a size 10. Very disappointed!"
1.0,My wife uses XXL for tops she wants loose. It said to order one size larger on the description. Ordered 3XL and they were very tight when she tried to get them on. Sent them back and ordered 5XL and they were still too small. Didn‚Äôt know they came from China.
1.0,"I was so excited to get these, based on reviews and pictures. Apparently, I got the reject pair, because they're horrible!! First issue, regarding sizing, I ordered a small (per sizing chart) because I am a size 4-6 and they are supposed to be roomy. I can't even get them past my thighs. Second issue, the button is barely hanging on and just spins/flops around. Good thing I never got the opportunity to even try and button them while on since I'm pretty sure it is on verge of falling off. Last issue, one ankle is clearly smaller than the other one. I could barely get my foot through that side and back off again. I thought maybe I was imagining things, but nope! I lined up both ankles and there is a definite size difference. Not sure who made my pair, but they seriously messed them up!"
1.0,Definitely would use it if it hadn't fallen apart the second I opened it. I know it was only a few bucks so I didn't expect much but I was hoping the clasp would've held together. Otherwise would've been perfect.
1.0,I‚Äôll begin with the positive. The bag was not expensive at all. It looks pretty from a distance.<br /><br />Now for the negative. The bag came practically destroyed already. Normally when these sort of items are purchased they come with dunnage to ensure the shape is kept in tact. With this particular purchase this was not the case. It was quite disappointing actually that the bag came with this pronounced seam at the bottom. When I opened up the packaging it literally flopped over. üò∂<br /><br />The bag was poorly constructed on the inside (trust me it looks pretty and shiny on the outside) and it feels really thin and flimsy to the touch even considering that it isn‚Äôt genuine leather ( I buy a lot of faux leather items and they have never felt like this). There‚Äôs no type of reinforcement on the inside so the bag really just collapses. If you are seeking a classy look I definitely do not recommend.
1.0,Before I put it on the button on the ear loop came off üò© when I took it out of the bag.
1.0,"This didn‚Äôt even fit me when I received it,"
1.0,"Totally NOT the photo! It feels like it‚Äôs made solely of polyester or other crap material, not soft, not cotton, not fitting at all, it took 3 months to get here, feels like you‚Äôre in a sauna when you‚Äôre wearing them and is probably fire retardant. This is the WORST clothing buying experience I‚Äôve had on here"
1.0,Esta grande y feo
1.0,"If you want a hat, this isn‚Äôt for you. Especially not a winter hat. This is a tissue paper thin head cover. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs $25. Returning."
1.0,Couldent figure out how to attatch to glasses
1.0,It isn't flattering on my figure
1.0,The first time I washed my hands one of the stones fell off within the first hour of wearing it.. very disappointed.
1.0,"This fits my 4' tall 8 year old daughter, not even a option for me (150 lb 5' 7&#34;). Cheap tiny Asian sizing. What a disappointment."
1.0,The XL size is really a Med. sizing not true!
1.0,This is what it looks like after 5 weeks of daily use.  I bought this because of the good reviews but this is not acceptable quality!  Past 30 days so no returns allowed for me üò¨
1.0,They look cute! But the sequin were falling off anespecially in the middle and some parts didn‚Äôt even had sequins so I expect everything falling off if I try to washed it out.
1.0,"This long sleeve shackef looking shirt is very cute but it VERY,VERY ITCHY. I would have loved it if it wasn‚Äôt as itchy as it is. As soon as you put it on you can feel it on your skin. It‚Äôs also very rough."
1.0,Looks and fits nothing like the picture. Horribly crafted.
1.0,One arm broke off after wearing it twice.
1.0,Product received was damaged and rusty. Bought it for a gift and could not give the person. Very disappointed. Do not buy.
1.0,I was sent a used item... the suit was faded and the gloves was dirty
1.0,They are too heavy so won't be able to wear.
1.0,Cheaply made .. Hoke first time I work it..a waste of money
1.0,Zipper broke for no reason.
1.0,This suite is sized two full sizes too small.
1.0,Weird fit. Didn‚Äôt fit nor look like the pic.<br />Do not buY!
1.0,I disliked that the 2g 6mm is missing the actual right size and I was given two of the 2g package which the other package was actually 0g in it. All of the rest except 00g was between 18g and 10g which was also disappointing since I brought these because the last set I order was missing 6g and 4g. Now I still have to move up to a 4g unless I go to my nearest professional piercer shop where they have expensive glass plugs which after your stretch doesn't help your next stretching at all like these do. O well my loss. I don't like to complain much of the time.
1.0,It is designed in such a way that the chapstick falls out too easily. Can‚Äôt keep it on your key chain or hanging on your purse because you will loose your chapstick.
1.0,This is more of a sportswear material. Clingy and thin. Color is as shown but I did not like the shirt for my body type (pear.) I wouldn't spend $20 on this.
1.0,It's cute but doesnt last at all. Worn and washed once and already extremely pilly.
1.0,"I bought two pairs and was ecstatic with how they fit, so I immediately bought two mor (I love leggings). Much to my horror, within one wear of the original two pairs, there was a rip in the crotch. I figured it was defective and gave the benefit of the doubt and kept that second order. BOTH pairs within the second order immediately had holes in the crotch. Eventually, the 4th pair followed suit within 4 washes. Considering all I spent for worthless leggings, it's worth it to pay the extra for Victoria Secret."
1.0,This band would not stay connected to watch. I was only able to wear three times before it came undone.
1.0,The material is thin and cheap. It literally looks like a dorag when you take it out of the package. I didn‚Äôt know what it was at first. Definitely returning this item üëéüèΩ
1.0,It‚Äôs cheap and looks nothing like the pic. Should‚Äôve sent it back
1.0,Not as thick as I had hoped for and very short in length.
1.0,"Tried using on our shoes and something is wrong with the nozzle.  It would barely spray, and when it did, it was a straight jet and looked horrible"
1.0,"My daughter wanted this to wear with a matching cami underneath.  Cute, I thought, until she opened it.  Stupidly little and skimpy, no way it‚Äôs a size large unless your from a Pygmy tribe.  Even then, it‚Äôs probably a small!  And the worst part is that it‚Äôs completely see through!  Quite risqu√© and that‚Äôs putting it nicely, ugh."
1.0,These are incredibly cheap. Poor quality. I would not recommend at all.
1.0,So tight in normal size - not going to work if you are tall 5‚Äô10‚Äù
1.0,"I didn't get to wear,  these fell apart immediately."
1.0,"I bought two of these as gift to my kids. On one of them the year and day of week could not adjusted immediately after getting the watch. My kid was excited and wanted to keep the watch. The other watch worked in the beginning but, after a small drop, it stopped working.  Few days later the first watch also stopped working. Not all self winding watches are good."
1.0,This bracelet has stickers for the letters so with thst being said you get it wet the stickers are coming off it lasted about 2 days.
1.0,"This dress is not like I expected. The quality of the skirt is poor like cheap polyester - not jersey material at all, which is what I hoped for. I missed the window to return but will not be keeping it."
1.0,Nothing like pictured üòï absolutely disappointed....  One earring is missing and the necklace iis broken and missing pearls....
1.0,"I loved the look of these earrings, but the studs/posts were too large to fit in my ear. I had to give them away because I wasn't able to wear them without stretching out my ears."
1.0,These are the cheapest looking earrings I have ever bought as an adult. They look like kiddie earrings that little girls play dress-up with.
1.0,"I purchased this for my Great Niece in a 2T/3T. She is a very petite 2yo, who can still fit her 18mths clothing (play clothing in the house only) snuggly. I was anticipating the arrival of this dress. I had sandals that would match perfectly for her. But, once I opened the package, I was saddened upon inspecting it. The armholes are super large ( too large for the size of the dress). The sequins were falling off, and the thread holding the sequins was not secured to the tutu. It has loose threading. You can see how cheaply made it is. You're blessed if you get 1 wear out of it. Once laundered, it would turn to shambles. It's not worth it! Poorly made! I feel mislead by this seller."
1.0,It did not fit im 104 pounds way to big two people can fit in this there was not and option for xs
1.0,"I ordered the ""F Red"" color and it looked nothing like the picture the ""blk' was blue and the ""gold"" was an ugly neon yellow. Not only were the colors completely off but the scarf was huge! Granted I'm 4'11 but i think it'd be huge on anyone. It looked like I was trying to model a damn blanket around my neck.. an ugly one at that.. super disappointed"
1.0,"Will let you know later,when I opened up the glass bag had to put the lenses in the frames hope they stay in the frames, they should come put together"
1.0,Much too tight
1.0,they left terrible welts on his my husband's legs below the knees. He has skinny calves.
1.0,Itchy material on the inside.  I can barely stands to wear them.
1.0,I ordered a med and received an XL....So typical
1.0,"I‚Äôm not trying to be mean, as it takes time to ship things out and stuff... but Absolutely horrible for a serious event, or a long party. Something short is more suitable for these masks."
1.0,"It was not really denim, it had a denim look and was not thick like denim"
1.0,"My experience receiving these shirts was disappointing. debating to return them. stitching/seams are not going to last one wear. Shirt looks like it will last about 3 washes, maybe - the color won't. the zipper is disappointing and way too dainty considering placement/function (it is so insignificant I'm afraid to actually touch it or it might break). the material is super thin, color is not vibrant (ordered the violet, black and white - all are muted - none are as shown online).  This purchase is arguably excusable because i bought it off the internet but ... this is a one shot ""wonder"" and NOT a repeat purchase. was so excited to get these shirts and then I opened them.<br /><br />:("
1.0,"I bought two pairs of these boots in March 2017 and both of them now (on April 30, 2017) have tears in the sides from regular wear and the bottom sole separated from the boot, so water gets in. Very disappointing. I would be more understanding of one pair doing this but I purchased two in different colors and both of them have the same issue. Possibly something in the material wasn't made very well in this batch? The seller was very responsive to the concerns and issued a refund promptly."
1.0,Broke apart within 1 week
1.0,Left my neck green and itching I wish I can give it no star
1.0,Broke 2 days after receiving them.
1.0,"These jeans feel cheap and look cheap.  Zipper was bent and ""crunchy"" sounding.  Keep looking ladies because you will hate these.  Returning immediately."
1.0,Color was not accurate. The first dress I received was the wrong dress entirely and I feel like I should have kept it. But returned it and now the actual dress is not meeting expectations at all. The black on the bottom is glaringly obvious a different black from the top. I tried it on anyways and the fit is good. But I can‚Äôt use it for what I planned with the color how it is. I don‚Äôt like writing reviews much but this was bad enough I had to share.
1.0,Cheated
1.0,"I have a 11.5 shoe size and these socks are rated up to size 13.  Can hardly get them on my feet.  However, the fit almost perfectly on my wife's foot and she is NOT a large women.  I would NEVER buy again."
1.0,"It is beautiful but the writing is in other languages, I was thinking receiving one in English."
1.0,"The first time I put it on, it snapped and broke. Waste of money and cheaply made or lack there of"
1.0,"Too large, thought that it was smaller in size"
1.0,"Got this and the FIFA club world champion badges, but all items were from 2018 when Real Madrid beat Liverpool to win.  Almost feels like a troll move."
1.0,The light stayed on even when you weren't near the purse and the battery ran out in only a week. Returning it.
1.0,"It is a cute skirt, but once you wash it, you will have to iron each and every time.  This is for my 10-year-old daughter.  I wanted a cute go-to navy blue skirt, but it and its sash are wrinkled, and it is not worth the time of ironing each time she wears it."
1.0,This was a toddler size cape it‚Äôs says kids but it‚Äôs meant for babies
1.0,[[VIDEOID:4f7e7c3363b86de144b3dd01f273be70]] Bad quality. The ring rusted in 3 weeks and three of the gems fell out.
1.0,Cheap tshirt. Was a hole in the side seam and had to use fabric glue to fix it to wear to the zodiac themed birthday party I was asked to wear my birth sign somehow. Should have just gotten a necklace instead. What a waste of money this was
1.0,Really bad quality. The letters were rated and ran together. I returned the item.
1.0,"The picture on Amazon does not accurately represent the exact product I received. In big, blue letters it says ‚ÄúEtorix.‚Äù That is misleading to not have anything in the picture and then have some random and nonsense word on it."
1.0,was fairly disappointed this did not fit any where true to size
1.0,Broke the 1st day. Did glow though
1.0,[[ASIN:B001BCAFKQ Celtic Key Pewter Pendant Necklace]] The key broke the first time my grand daughter<br />wore her Christmas present. It was a gift she had asked for (Key Pendant ) The the top of the key came apart<br />and it is unfixable . It is a poorly made piece of junk-I would have gladly paid more if the item she recieved<br />was as strong as it appeared in ad.
1.0,I did not receive what was in the picture. I received instead a pack of 3 boho bands that will only work on a ponytail. Very disappointed. See picture of what I did receive.<br />Unfortunately it's not even worth it to return due to the postage.
1.0,This design is a cheap stollen/rip off version of the larger and better quality hard enamel pin design by 0liminalcraft0 on etsy.<br /><br />Do not support theft.
1.0,"Super comfortable. I am updating this review after wearing them the third time, I realized that there was a rip across the top of both back pockets and across the bottom of both back pockets. Only wore them three times if I could give zero stars I would"
1.0,First time I wore them a stone fell out. Second time I wore them the earring separated from the ear wire. I wrote them and they did not respond so I assume they aren't going to do anything about it. I won't buy from them again.
1.0,Broke first time using it. We were using it in the house....‚òπ
1.0,"It was a very strange neckline, felt a little like you were being strangled."
1.0,"Great look, terrible quality.<br />Most of these got holes the first day I wore them."
1.0,"The item showed up with the color very washed out. Not at all like picture. Wanted to return, but the seller informed me that since its over seas I would have to pay for shipping. That is almost double what the shirt cost."
1.0,These arrived broken.
1.0,Too big.Material was very stiff --- I don't think I will be using it.Not what I expected at all.
1.0,Tried to contact the company for warranty but cannot get a hold of them.  Really would like to get this 1 year warranty taken care of but seems nobody is able to help.
1.0,I returned these.  They were so small and thin it was disappointing. When I called to return they had no problem taking them back.
1.0,Very thin material with a raw cut edge. Not black as pictured. It is flesh colored rag with FLESH colored print! Whose brite idea was that..
1.0,Ordered the size I normally. It was way to small. Probably should move up 2 sizes.
1.0,Cute at first but the sole unglued 2 months after buying.  They weren't everyday sneakers either!  She wore them only a handful of times when we were out at night so now it's too late to return!  Pretty disappointed.
1.0,Ordered a 11Y dress got a size 2 T
1.0,It was supposed to be Royal Blue! Instead it is more like Navy Blue. Not what I needed!
1.0,Not happy with product
1.0,Unfortunately the quality of this product is very poor.
1.0,"This swimsuit was for my granddaughter's 3rd birthday and I bought size 3 for her , but we couldn't even get it on. It was so small , it probably would have fit an infant.By the time I got it back from my daughter in law to return it the return window had already passed. So needless to say, it was as if I just threw $20.00 out the window. I can't believe this item is made by Disney and they would make such a big error. I am a big fan of Amazon and have purchased many items and had never encountered a problem, but after this I will probably not buy certain items from Amazon."
1.0,"This product looks awesome in the picture, and it is portrayed as 316L surgical steel.  Beware, though.  The post is steel, but the actual anchor is made of shiny plastic that is somehow attached to the post."
1.0,This is not a nepal beaded bracelet.  The picture you show is a key chain or lanyard.
1.0,Dupatta I received (twice) was not a phulkari and definitely didn‚Äôt look anything like the picture or description. Please save yourself the trouble and Do Not Order this item.
1.0,I got these for my 3 year old son and could not get them on his hands. The material does not stretch. Had to return to Amazon.
1.0,These came in with the white outline. I already had the purple and white masks that were much cheaper than the purple on purple. I would not recommend this if you are looking for what was advertised
1.0,"Let me start off by saying I bought a 3X!!! I‚Äôm 5 foot and 190, this fits like a medium! The material is very thin, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend washing it in anything other then cold and hang drying it. Definitely on my regret buying list, you get what you pay for though."
1.0,"Fit is perfect, but material is cheap and very see through."
1.0,"This is NOT WATERPROOF. I tested it by running some water over it with my hand inside, and my hand got soaking wet."
1.0,The top part is designed for big breasts. I'm an A-cup and it looks horrible. It has a built-in paddig that's impossible to remove without braking the fabric. It's a pity because the bottom part looks very classy. Might work for women with full B or C cup. üòûüò™
1.0,The case is cheap looking.  The rose  gold color doesn't look like the picture. The case is really cheap. I brought two of the phone cases and there not wroth it.
1.0,Horrible quality. Made in China. Falling apart right out of the bag. Literal garbage.
1.0,"Color is not what it appears in picture. It fits very small, so order a size or two up. Material is very cheap as well, and easily rips."
1.0,wouldn't know cause I still haven't got it..a month  ordered back first week of September still waiting wedding is in a couple days. had to go get something else cause.im playing it safe.so.if I have something important coming up plan way ahead
1.0,"Didn't match the size guidelines, disappointing"
1.0,"This little romper was very cute however when I washed it according to instructions, it literally fell apart. It was returned and I was promptly refunded. Possibly just one that wasn‚Äôt sewn correctly."
1.0,Very fake looking
1.0,The lab coat looks like a long blouse. The scrubs material is not what you‚Äôd expect. It‚Äôs very stretchy and moves too much when you walk
1.0,"This product was poorly made. The buckle was not even sewn on but rather it just had the elastic threaded through the buckle. Of course, it would not hold. Needless to say, this product has been returned."
1.0,It is too much bad !!
1.0,The shirt fit a size or two smaller than most.  Had to return it. The material is also very thin.
1.0,Too small. Short and snug fitting.
1.0,Returned it. Was not at all like the photos.
1.0,Poorly finished. Too &#34;limp&#34; and does not hold any shape. I returned purse.
1.0,Absolutely horrible sizing. 3xl came in the size of a L.
1.0,I had bought these for my wedding and now I have to purchase other shoes because the strap around the ankle is too tight so that was a waste of money and time.
1.0,These pants were super cute! Unfortunately every pair I purchased separated in the back along the same seam shortly after the return window closes. I work in an office and am gentle on my clothing btw.  Very disappointing
1.0,Too thin and material was scratchy. No stretch in material.<br /> I returned it
1.0,The dress looked like an old table covering.  This is not my style.
1.0,NOT FOR YOUNG BOYS!!!! WAY TO LARGE
1.0,This product does not work as good as I thought! I placed these pads on the bottom of my soles and they within 24 hours fell off. I was in a meeting and one stuck to the ground and it was quite embarrassing.
1.0,The backing do not fit onto earrings.  Very disapointing!!!
1.0,It broke the same day I got it. Very poor design.
1.0,Cheaply made and has a funny smell to it. Will not recommend. It‚Äôs still in the package and never been wore. Will eventually put it in the trash since it‚Äôs too late to return.
1.0,I received a zip up not a pull over

1.0,"CALLER was nothing like the picture on Amazon, the jacket was so wrinkled in about two sizes too small."
1.0,Got this for my boyfriend - it fits well and looks like the pictures but has about 15 loose threads already and he's only worn it for two days.  It's basically falling apart already.
1.0,"This item was great at first, them within a week it broke.  The piece that holds the eye glass leg broke off.  Seller will not refund nor replace item.  It is on my do not buy list."
1.0,Terrible experience. I bought two pairs. On both the pants fit  but the top was two sizes too large. I was only allowed to return one pair at the UPS store. I went through the Amazon app several times trying to get a return code for the other pair and I cant. Very disappointed and angry.
1.0,Feels cheap..Too light of a band for my Luminox Watch. Didn't like it. Put the regular band back on my Luminox.
1.0,"Idk where the 5 star reviews came from because this looks nothing like the image. Color is like a Tang orange color and not beige/ivory like shown. Also the lace is completely different to what‚Äôs pictured. Lace detail is entirely different and though the quality is soft, it looks cheaply made."
1.0,"Not waterproof at all. After a snow storm we had, and extensive use in the snow the gloves were wet. Touch screen does not respond when touched with gloves.<br />They should really alter the description. Very deceiving."
1.0,strap broke after first week of wear merchant does not stand behind product
1.0,"I seemed to get a raised itchy rash from where the metal hits your wrist. I have no allergies and usually don't have a problem with cheap metals.  It's definitely easy to apply and the pins stay put unlike other wrist bands I've gotten, but wouldn't recommend for obvious reasons"
1.0,This shirt is very cheap quality. Very thin. Very wide and not long at all. Would not recommend. I ordered an XL
1.0,color is almost a yellow instead of off white and extremely small in size...
1.0,I had it for less than a week and the chicken wing came off the chain. Lost! Very disappointed.
1.0,This product is on a froot of the loom shirt and is wide and<br /> not long so short and wide and is not soft feels scratchy my past experience tells me with shirts like this they shrink up and stay wide so disappointing
1.0,Thought it would be cute for my 3 year old niece. Way to big for her.
1.0,"The earrings and bracelet are plastic. My bracelet broke right away. The hat is a different color from the jewelry. I was so angry, I threw it away. Wish I could rate it a ‚Äú0‚Äù. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
1.0,"Dangerous The heart actually came off The earring post remains in the ear securely screwed on Granddaughter is 20 months old Within 24 hours heart missing Left the post, front disc in ear Can't get out Can't get hold of disc to unscrew the back Not happy"
1.0,"Great price, delivered quickly. I bought these because I use computers a lot at work and I get headaches from this. However, they make me look cross eyed they way they sit on my face. Very big frames. Sadly, I won't be wearing these."
1.0,Looks like a 10 year old made it in  school for a project very thin and cheep
1.0,"This is not the think canvas you'd expect from a backpack.  It's quite thin.  The bag came with hole in seam, stitched it up but the seam just kept coming apart.  My daughter had this for kindergarten so there were never any real books in it.  I expect a bag to fall apart by the end of the year but we had to replace it by winter break and probably should have earlier."
1.0,Returned item. Nothing like what is advertised.  Unfortunate.
1.0,"Product was amazing love the color and length but only issue is that it was ripped from the side, and I mean little stitching will work but this is to big of a rip that can not be fix since it‚Äôs on the see thru part."
1.0,Not what I wanted I wanted glasses to go over your regular glasses to drive at night
1.0,"These earrings are junk. They look nothing like the photo, and they are incredibly difficult to get in and out of your ear. I wish I could include a photo with the review so you could see the difference, but they were so awful I basically threw them out. I suppose I could have returned them but I just felt icky returning something that had been in my ear. Stay away."
1.0,This product is pretty much useless. After trying for about an hour to use it I gave up and had more luck using my hands/fingers.
1.0,Not flattering on anyone but the model! Sizing is totally off! I normally wear an XL and the 3XL barely fit
1.0,Skirt has awlful odor
1.0,I was so excited to receive this as a gift for Christmas but the groove is so shallow the hairtie slips right off. Its a Shane because the rose golkd is so pretty. I would not recommend this product. Spend a little more and get yourself a better bracelet with another brand.
1.0,Would have been great but it fell over my face or off the back of my head.
1.0,Disappointed. The advertised photo does not show the bright yellow and purple colors that are included throughout the pattern. Returned
1.0,Polyester:  65% Not as described
1.0,The with was too small for most adult women to ware. I will not recommend it.
1.0,Way smaller than they appeared in the picture. Great for a little kid but not an adult. They actually look kind of cheap.
1.0,"I am really sad that this doesn't even come close to a 9-12 size. I looked everywhere for a size tag on the product and couldn't find one.... Perhaps it will fit my LO next summer, she will be 20+ months then and it may still be too big...."
1.0,Felt stretched out don‚Äôt stay on
1.0,Replaced battery and the hands fell off the front and kept spinning. No way to fix it..ony 5 months old!
1.0,"While initially pleased with the &#34;HDE holdover athletic yoga pants&#34;, now am very much not. Since I purchased them, I have washed them three times and worn them three times. This last time, I tried to pull the legs up a bit from just below my knee. The fabric stretched slightly and then ripped across the leg. Not along a seam, not at an obvious rip or snag in the fabric. Just straight across."
1.0,"This material is cheap, worse quality than Kmart or Walmart or even Meyer's. I mean, this is just really really BAD printing on the textile and it is definitely not cute like the photo shown. Don't be deceived, don't waste your money, unless you're super desperate for a poolside coverup. It's $10 and it sure looks like it too! Too good to be true. I'm returning."
1.0,I originally gave this 5 stars but moved it down to 1.  The product is cute and the message is sweet but after 2 Months of use the message part came completely off from the keychain and it‚Äôs no where to be found.
1.0,I loved the width and color and how these glasses looked on me. Unfortunately the hing on the glasses were broken upon arrival! I didn‚Äôt attempt to return them not knowing policy.
1.0,Not at all like the picture and unraveling
1.0,Order a large and it will not even fit a teenage.
1.0,"Does not stay on feet even tho has rubber. There are slightly bigger cotton ones that are much better for tennis shoes. This would work with flat, petite feet."
1.0,"Poor quality, doesn't match pictures.<br />Oversized and very boxey. I wear a lot of BoHo Chicken clothing..  This is NOT that.. Appears nothing like pictures.<br />Material is stiff..  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I ordered 6mm and received what looks like 5 or 4mm. They aren't the same size as my other 6mm stud earrings. The backs are so flimsy, they don't properly hold the earring in your ears. The stem of the earrings are so short and not proportionate to the stud. I am very upset with this purchase."
1.0,Have had this jacket about 4 months and only rode with it in about 25 or so times and now the elbow guards are coming off. So if you don‚Äôt bend your arms at all this would be a great jacket for you. If you are like a normal human maybe just pass and look for something else ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Terrible build quality. Also... cortech doesn‚Äôt directly deal with warranty claims through the buyer unless you directly bought your stuff from them.. so i made this claim about 3 days ago and still waiting to hear back about warranty -.- pretty annoying
1.0,Came broken sent them back
1.0,Ridiculously huge and completely see-through.
1.0,"one of the sleeve is stretchy, but other is cotton material and very tight fitting. The shirt fabric is very uncomfortable. I always buy tunic at amazon, but this is the first that I did not like."
1.0,I really love simple made blouses ilove  to dress them up with pretty scarfs  but these look really weird around the breast area but I do have large  breast I got the right size but they just do not  look right I will. Be sending them  back
1.0,they were broken when they arrived
1.0,Very thin and cheap piece of leather. It looked like a thick quality piece of leather in the pictures but what arrives is paper thin and cheaply made. I am not expecting this to last much longer than a few months at most. It may not be expensive but it is still a total waste of money.
1.0,"Does not fit the movado 2.0 as advertised. The connection bar provided is too long. Also, one side of the band is completely closed off and the connection band doesn‚Äôt even go through it so you can attempt to connect to your watch."
1.0,I was excited for this dress but when it came in the material was so cheap
1.0,"I've only been wearing the bracelet for about 3 weeks. And it's fading already, very disapointed"
1.0,It literally says your name here
1.0,"I‚Äôm sorry, but this dress is awful. Color and design is exactly as pictured. But the material is equivalent to a fabric shower curtain - ZERO stretch. I couldn‚Äôt even take it off without some assistance. You‚Äôll be well served passing on this one."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt come like pictures
1.0,Looks so cute in picture but like a maternity shirt when it arrived:(
1.0,Not worth it.  Material was very see through and cheap looking
1.0,The adhesive doesn‚Äôt work so it keeps falling off every time you pull your panties down.
1.0,It's a flimsy type material with a make believe pocket on the back of the neck! Why? It does not fit well. Hard to find the company address to return it. I want all my money back!<br />Not happy with this product at all!
1.0,"This product is cheap and the medium size fits more like a small. The fabric is really thin and seems like it will shrink after a wash. The graphic design on the t shirt looks nothing like the photo, it is faded and dull. I will be returning this product. Would not recommend"
1.0,"Size way , way off"
1.0,I normally wear an XL but after reading reviews I bought an 2XL. It was small!!! No give in the shirt either.  I immediately returned it!
1.0,I‚Äôm a man who got this for Halloween. Was a Grady twin from the shining. Had to dress it up a bit. Anyway. I don‚Äôt really have breasts. But a large was VERY tight on the chest lol. Like an Xs men‚Äôs T-shirt tight. So idk how you‚Äôd fit breasts in this. But I‚Äôd guess you‚Äôd need to go a few sizes higher than what you‚Äôd expect if you‚Äôre larger than an a cup.
1.0,thought it was more of a draw string on the sides not the sleeves
1.0,Too thin for cost
1.0,"Cheap, broke already."
1.0,I wouldn't call this material moisture wicking. It's similar to the plastic pants if the 80s and it's noisy with movement.
1.0,I would rate this ZERO STARS.  This product should have been recalled and should not be sold!!!!!  My baby 23 weeks old has to have surgery to remove them from his stomach and bowel!!!  He was able to crush them enough to swallow after they broke off the back of his harness!!  He may not make it!!!  YOU SUCK!!!!!!
1.0,broke as soon as i tried to put it on. its crap.
1.0,The clasp broke right away rendering it useless.
1.0,They are very cute suits but they are cut small. 14/16 is a bit loose on my daughter but with these she had trouble even getting them on.
1.0,This was supposed to be a birthday present for my niece and it arrived today with black splotches on it. They do not come off. It's like a defective pendant that had issues with engraving. Otherwise it would be very nice if not for that. I will be returning and hopefully can get another not tarnished one asap!!
1.0,Runs very small. Purchased a xl only for it to fit like a medium.
1.0,"Everything about this short sucks. The fabric is this verywierd shiny synthetic material. Not breathable at all.<br />The hem at the bottom is weird. It's almost like a banded shirt so unless you're a twig, expect to look like you have a huge gut.  It's sized like a small even though I ordered large. It took THREE months to get to me. So yeah. Save your 25 bucks."
1.0,Not comfortable shoes and sized big.
1.0,"No way these can be all cotton.  Feels more like polyester, elastane, maybe some cotton, and I'm not risking nylon.  I'm highly allergic to nylon."
1.0,Poor quality.<br />It breaks in 4 hours at work.<br />I use to wear Arctic shield system gloves is best in my life but it‚Äôs temporary out now.
1.0,Says 18 G & it's so much smaller than an 18G? Extremely dissatisfied
1.0,NO. just NO. you have hips or boobs.... look elsewhere don't waste your money
1.0,It broke after less than a month.
1.0,Guess I misjudged the width of this product. It is not compatible with all bra bands. Was hoping to use for my nursing bras as I lose baby weight so I wouldn't have to buy new bras every 3 months. It sucks that there's more bra extenders out there than tighteners.
1.0,"Picture looks so cool, but it doesn't look like that. It fell apart so fast, it frayed and fuzzied very fast and gets in my eyes constantly. It smelled like chemicals when I got it. Waste of $13.99."
1.0,I like the earrings ok but the backs r 2 big and fall off.  Had 2 spend time finding it b4 the baby.  Not good
1.0,The material was too thin
1.0,For USA buyer. I suggest buying two sizes up.
1.0,This band is super stiff and EXTREMELY hard to get off. I couldn't get it off and it took my husband forever. Very cheaply made. Super disappointed
1.0,"I was so excited for these dresses. I pulled it out of the plastic sleeve and the strap was already disconnected due to the really poor stitching. I bought this in both the mustard and the darker red. The mustard straps was already disconnected but I was able to put on the red and the waist stitching is barely attached. The dresses are cute but based on the recommendations, would‚Äôve been too big, so if I did get this product, I would size down.<br /><br />So disappointed in the quality!"
1.0,"Cheap, not a flattering shape."
1.0,"Sizing is Chinese so order 5 sizes larger than normal, do not follow sizing in description. I normally wear a sz18 but the 5xl would barely fit my sz8 sister.  If I had known it was from China, I never would have ordered it."
1.0,Too large for the size I ordered
1.0,Too small despite buying my size fabric is very cheap
1.0,One earring came broke but after I fixed it they are some nice earrings
1.0,"What you don't see from the picture online is you don't see the character faces clearly because of the way it's sewn. I tried to make them both visible, but it won't work, and even getting one to be visible makes a boxy look for the mask on your face"
1.0,It definitely had a strong odor but the company was great with the return and refund ‚ù§Ô∏è
1.0,"Product stopped charging after second use, just disappointment."
1.0,Was super excited about this. When I received it today it was in a smaller box that the brim of the hat is all bent and the straw is broken in multiple spots.
1.0,Looked like my grandmothers old nightgown.
1.0,Cheaply made the zipper covers half the bag. Ill be sending this back. I could of ordered off ali express for $4
1.0,The watch does not work at all the analog part of the watch has to be set twice a day and the digital watch part has to be set once a week. It does not keep time. Would not recommend it to anyone.
1.0,"After purchasing it, the seller changed it to not eligible for prime/returns for whatever reason it is. Not cool considering its quality. They are fashionable but very difficult if wearing for a long time. They cause terrible pain behind the ears. The ones I purchased are mirrored but one can still see my eyes through them which is another minus."
1.0,Did not work at all. Would not turn on. Total waste of time and money.
1.0,"I got the small and medium. Neither short looked like the photo. They were huge and looked like I was wearing balloon shorts. I'm 5'7"" 120 lbs. Also, I returned them a few weeks ago, and still have not received my money back."
1.0,"Very very poor quality.....this isn't a jacket...more like cheap synthetic shirt, not cotton, not waxed or canvas. More like a lined discolored button up dress shirt. Don't waste your money. I expected a nice jacket for that price I got 5 bucks cheaper shirt that won't fit a child.<br />Very disappointed.<br />Do not buy this."
1.0,These are not women's sizes!
1.0,"The neck line is Awkwardly high, almost like when you have an adjustable strap that is adjusted to the tightest setting, except these straps are not adjustable. Looks so odd on! Returned the dress. Too bad. Other than that, it would have been really cute."
1.0,The dress fit as expected and the color was nice. But the dress was see through and the strap broke after one wear.
1.0,I‚Äôve had my nose pierced for 11 years so I‚Äôve had MANY nose rings. I generally purchase a pack like these and they last for a year. When these come in I put one in any holy shit it hurt. Similar to the first time you switch out your original piercing for a replacement piece. I‚Äôve had it in for a few weeks and noticed today Major discoloring of the nose ring and my nose piercing itself - both black. I started to remove it to replace with a new one and it hurt like hell AGAIN. I got out a new ring and looked at it closely and it‚Äôs the ball on the end that‚Äôs the issue. It‚Äôs way too big. It‚Äôs bigger than the small stone on the other end. Trash. Throwing them all out and ordering new ones. Do NOT recommend!
1.0,The size is very very am small
1.0,Ugly in person and something feels off about the fabric.
1.0,The sizing on this shirt is not accurate at all. Based on their sizing I ordered up a size and it should have been loose but I couldn‚Äôt even put it on it was so small. They are also not flexible in returning the item even though it was not advertised accurately.
1.0,What were they thinking.Ugly purse.
1.0,The only thing I like about it was the face. It seems more like a woman's watch than a man's watch. The leather wrist strap is very thin and very cheap. I'm really disappointed I spent so much money on the rush delivery. I was hoping to give it to my boyfriend for Christmas but I don't think I want to see him pretend to like it. I definitely want to return this item.
1.0,I ordered an XL and it must be for a toddler.  They wouldn't take it back & only gave a $1.50 refund. which the blouse was more. Won't be ordering from they ever
1.0,I loved the earrings but they broke the first time I put them on.
1.0,"Super thin, don‚Äôt waste your time."
1.0,Never got them..prime membership not very sold gaurantee.
1.0,"These headbands were just the right size for my 6 week old, and would probably fit well for a while, but the amount of stitching just under the flower was too much and quickly left imprints in my baby's head. Also, the felt underneath the flower was very large, and would not bend to sit well on  my baby's head. It just looks stupid."
1.0,i was so disappointed it was so cute and when I tried it on the arm holes are way too small
1.0,This is a child size watch ‚Ä¶ for tiny wrists only.
1.0,"I was very disappointed , this is nothing but overpriced windbreaker."
1.0,"This is a design printed on cheap white fabric and is cheaply made.  It is a true wrap dress but does not have any tie to attach the first layer so it does not stay in place to the point I had to add a hook and eye to hold it in place.  The outside has a tie which works alright.  The length just barely covers my panties and only if I do not move.  The ruffle is just finished with  a surger on the outside edge.  The fabric is thin and noisy, it feels really cheap."
1.0,"Returned it , because it diidn't work in the car"
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture !!!  I wanted one with the button tab.  Very disappointed with the cheap look of the band.
1.0,Chain broke within first wear
1.0,Awful! Based on the other customer reviews I felt confident buying that shirt for my brother for Christmas. We ordered a 2X and upon receiving the package the shirt would possibly fit a large. The fabric was thin and very rough. The shirt was immediately returned.
1.0,I don‚Äôt like that it appears solid in the advertising but completely see through in person.
1.0,The hook itself was nice. If it's  something you're going to wear I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. The necklace itself is cheaply made.  The only reason it is getting one star because I cannot submit the comment without it.
1.0,"Top was cute but runs large. Return approved but instead of Prime free shipping, cost was almost as much as the top to ship back."
1.0,Loved these for the first ten minutes...then they fell apart...literally while sitting on my face.<br /><br />Very upset. These would have been amazing. Look for the same design in a high-end brand...
1.0,I certainly shouldn't have paid what I paid for it... It isn't worth the money I paid. Looks cheap and gold wore off after several days of use.
1.0,"Because the lens is flat, not curved, they reflect whatever is behind you, which makes them not only distracting but dangerous for driving. I also didn't like the way they looked on my face. I tried them on then went to Marshall's and got a much better pair for cheaper."
1.0,"All my Tom's are 10M. This pair was marked 10M, but WAY TO SMALL. Don't understand why, but they were returned."
1.0,I have purchased this time twice.  There's a defect with the fastener part of this earing.  I asked them to replace first pair I bought and and they did.  The second pair has same problem.
1.0,I got this for my husband and I to wear.  His is bigger than expect but that‚Äôs ok. Mines was like a small instead of large and I can‚Äôt wear it.
1.0,Sent back for refund...not of quality...don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,Band secure piece is designed to be pulled apart = pulls through and rips silicone.  Went through both bands in a few months or less.
1.0,Not the material I was planning on. Sparkling looking skirt
1.0,These shoes lasted right around a month before the velcro came completely off of one shoe. Total waste of money.
1.0,Poorly made. I ordered a large and as soon as I put it on and it ripped at the back.
1.0,The material wasn't soft it had a rough feeling to it . I returned it.
1.0,Did not receive the jewelry in the picture. Received a different style necklace not once but twice! Returned it the first time and re ordered hoping to get the style pictured and this is what I received.
1.0,These earrings aren‚Äôt as nice as they appear in the picture. Very poorly put together and cheap.
1.0,Too wide across wrist
1.0,Even the largest size was not large enough.
1.0,I could not screw on the end because it was too small
1.0,Too stiff and low quality.
1.0,"Was supposed to be a shirt, I recieved a dress rhat looked nothing like the picture. I waited weeks for it and got nothing like I ordered"
1.0,"Very nice watch for the price. Disappointed that the battery died two months after purchase, so actually not even worth the small price tag. Spend a few extra bucks on a watch that will last."
1.0,"Tag and bag was labeled XL, but barley fits like a Small. How does this even happen..."
1.0,The material is not as soft as the Heat shirts of similar style
1.0,Not a great dress. Runs at least one size small. More like a nightgown.
1.0,Bought in May 2018 and the left shoe sole separated causing me to trip. Lucky for me I caught myself.
1.0,"Posts are too short, delicate and easily bent.  I've ruined one already trying to get it in my ear.  Loss.  The backs<br />are tiny/itsybitsy/tiny/tiny.  NOT for anyone with arthritis.  This purchase was a disappointment."
1.0,"The outfit wasn't as cute as shown.  The top is huge and the shorts were extra long, so it looked awkward together.  It was very baggy looking, even if you get the right size it just doesnt look proportionate.  My girls are average size too."
1.0,This shoe was two times my shoe size like they accidentally sent a men‚Äôs shoe. It also looked very bad and definitely cheap.
1.0,I‚Äôm unsure if they are all just defective but none fit my septum ring. They wouldn‚Äôt screw in.<br />Good price but none of them fit so it‚Äôs pointless
1.0,CROSS SLIPS RIGHT OUR OF THEINFINITY  LOOP..JUNK!
1.0,So so so cheap
1.0,"I have to say, from the beginning, I wonder about the authenticity of the other reviews. Upon receiving this garment, the first thing I noticed was how utterly awful the stars and stripes were. Made from some sort of shiny vinyl or plasticlike material made this look more like a costume item rather than something you would wear out and about. To add to that, the seams around the decoration were not finished. With raw edges and, not even surged, it looked like it was made in a beginning sewing class.<br /><br />Now then, on to fit. I wear a large on pretty much everything from shirts to jackets and, understand what fitted means. It means it is snug but not tight. When I put this on, it was very difficult to get my arms through the jacket's arms. Then, as I was buttoning it down, it began to pucker between the middle two buttons causing an exaggerated gap. I couldn't even get the pucker out by pulling it in.<br /><br />In summary, I would have to say this is one of the worse items I have purchased to date and, I would not recommend it to anyone. Large should be medium, medium should be small and, small, should be for a child. If you order this jacket. Looks can be deceiving online. This is certainly one of those times. Save yourself some time, aggravation and, disappointment. Spend a bit more and get quality like Wrangler or Levi. You'll be much happier in the long run. No, I am not an employee of either one of those companies."
1.0,I ordered a 2XL and it did NOT fit. This outfit must of been made for a child and I'm a grown women. I was very disappointed and had to give it away to my mother an order something else. I will NOT order from this company again. I'm a plus size women that wears a 1XL and I assumed I would purchase the 2XL so I can have more room but NOT. The pants fit like spandex. Do not waste your money or time on this product or the merchant.
1.0,"The fabric is too thin, especially for a long sleeve dress. Very disappointed!"
1.0,They are too short and they only come up on the hip not up on the waist i will be returning them
1.0,Size is at least 2 sizes too small
1.0,Broke after a few uses...very thin and bendable material.
1.0,These are too ting for a 5 1/2
1.0,The cut was super small at the top and the arm area. Just no!!
1.0,Piece of crap broke after 2 weeks of wearing them. Poor quality product!
1.0,"I have a normal head, this thing wont even fit around my head to secure the Velcro. Invest a few more dollars and get a good one."
1.0,This is terrible fabric and it looks terrible and cheap too. Wish I could've returned it but missed the return window
1.0,Was fallen apart when delivered. My husband wears them all the time. But not these. Very üòû
1.0,It‚Äôs cute but it wouldn‚Äôt even close. Tiny although I sized up
1.0,"The product that they send is completely black, looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,Literally the worst leggings I've ever owned. They are see-through and itchy and way way way too tiny on the waist In about a foot too long almost as if they were made for a 6-ft tall size double zero person. The seam is also very awkwardly placed and no matter how I try to wear them my almost non-existent belly fat and love handles managed to bulge out over the top and bottom of the supposed tummy control waistband The biggest waste of money I've ever spent
1.0,The seller recommends ordering a size down as the item runs large.  This is not the case.  I ordered a size down from what I usually order and could not button the shirt.
1.0,"Would not recommend as these do not hold up. Probably had it on for a total of 10 hrs. Unfortunately, was 1 week past return window for Amazon so out of luck."
1.0,"I usually wear a 12 or 14. These pants are junk. Way room long, falling down, and cheap fabric. Will be sending back. I could get better quality at Walmart or Dollar General üòÇ"
1.0,"Saw other reviews about small sizing so I went up, still too small. Seams seemed loosely stitched and just over all poorly put together. The straps are very annoying if you have a larger chest."
1.0,"I bought this form my daughter for christmas present and as soon as she opened it, the butterfly fell off."
1.0,I can‚Äôt recommend these. They came apart after wearing them once
1.0,Bristles are too soft can‚Äôt use to clean anything. Definitely not for dishwashing. Don‚Äôt buy it. Complete waste.
1.0,I thought the print would be cute but this looks more like a sleep shirt than anything else. It‚Äôs entirely too small and material is super thin.
1.0,Horrible<br />Too small<br />Out of shape<br />Piece of junk
1.0,"Returned this due to extremely long sleeves!  They covered well past my granddaughter's hands, and she does not have short arms!!"
1.0,It looks nothing like what is pictured. It is just a basic sweatshirt.
1.0,"The color was really off from the picture.  The colors were not vibrant.  Very disappointed in product!!!  Material cheap.  Would like to return, but missed window to return."
1.0,Cheap quality material.  Badly sewed
1.0,"Complete trash. I broke the lsat watch I was using to practice 3 days before my lsat so I rushed to order this one. 2 days before my lsat it comes in the mail, open it, and it doesn't even work. I can adjust the minute hand but once I try to start the time nothing moves. DO NOT BUY THIS"
1.0,Feels like imitation leather
1.0,Se revienta con facilidad
1.0,Way too small for any man‚Äôs hands!

1.0,Cheap...cheap.cheap
1.0,"Poor quality,  I donated it, not even worth the postage for a return.Incredibly small and cheap."
1.0,"These were so pretty when I first got them. However, they went from a really pretty gold to almost a burnt color in a matter of weeks."
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt like the vertical lines on the dress. They were not straight and it was very noticeable. Also, contrary to what others said, the material is thin and see through. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Too small even for a small teenage girl, smell weird and fell apart after washing them once WTF!?"
1.0,This is bright red in person and very see-through. It's not very wide but it's VERY long. I'm 5'7&#34; and I would have over a foot of fabric dragging behind me. I sent mine back
1.0,After two days the watch no longer lights up ‚Ä¶..not good  for our three year old great nephew!!!
1.0,The pendent was so small you could hardly see it .
1.0,"In the photo it looks like pink and navy blue, but it arrived and was actually pink and royal purple.  Not at all what I wanted, didn't match the navy and pink theme I bought it for and there's no way my husband will ever wear a pink and purple tie.  Had to take a loss on this one, giving it away."
1.0,It was a navy blue liner or accent that is not part of the picture very disappointe
1.0,Very pretty but it does not hang straight and the first time wearing it the tree fell off
1.0,Chest area is see though when get wet !!!  Doesn't have that thin padding ALL bathing suites come with disappointed! And embarrassed
1.0,My daughter hates it
1.0,"Horribly and deceptively described. The pleather trim and colors of the various materials were as feminine as anything I've bought, and I can pull off pink! That they were described as lined/warm, compatible w/ touchscreens and specifically for men is almost comically inaccurate."
1.0,Shrunk in the wash on first washing - cannot wear again
1.0,"Quality is as shown...tassels are well made. It‚Äôs just not patriotic as described...it‚Äôs coral, not red"
1.0,I didn't like fabric.It wasn't soft.Also didn't like fit.

1.0,The rabbits fell off in just a few days .
1.0,Ran Very very very small
1.0,I got the biggest size and it was still way too small
1.0,"Didn‚Äôt realise the back was red. This necklace seems to have not sold as a red gem, so they have put the initial on the back and selling it as the new front. Very disappointed but still had to give as a gift because I had nothing else."
1.0,"This item is very very small! I think they are measuring this for boys. These pants are not meant for men. I ordered a size larger and they were still very very short, tight and small. I simply don‚Äôt understand this company‚Äôs measuring system. I think it‚Äôs a Chinese company, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure. Nevertheless, these pants are meant for boys ... maybe not even boys?"
1.0,"I liked NOTHING about these pants . I bought a large for my husband and they were so small I thought about my 12 yr old grandson , THEN I saw how thin they were and realized they are see thru ! WTH !!!!"
1.0,"I'm a size 10, I figured the dress would have fit looser since it is a &#34;One size fits most&#34; dress. I was disappointed in the fit,  but the material was good,  and the structure of the dress was good."
1.0,Came with cat hair yak returned
1.0,"Es de muy costoso para la calidad de la tela, lo pedi un n√∫mero mas grande para que quede mas largo y no, queda muy corto. Lo pedi para una boda en la ma√±ana pero solo sirve para ir al parque con unos zapatos bajitos."
1.0,This is very pretty and has a great shine. However after wearing them for three days (I purchased two) I have three stones that have fallen out. I am not happy nor pleased with the quality of this product.
1.0,Very thin and cheap silver.
1.0,"I will never order from this seller again. The dress is not as expected. Picture is deceiving. The dress pictures are not clearly stated. If they had been, I would not have ordered the dress. I am out of $8.00 in postage to send it back!"
1.0,Too tight to wear.
1.0,I was very disappointed with these earrings. They are really cute but have a magnetic closure.  I have long hair and it would be very easy to pull these off my ear. If you like a magnetic closure get these.  I don't like it.
1.0,Size isn‚Äôt correct. At least 1 size smaller than it states. Also. Sent back both shoes I bought and only received refund for one.
1.0,"I wish I could give this zero stars! I got it way later than I was told, and when it arrived the fabric was thin/see thru/cheap, and not what was advertised. I would say buyer beware."
1.0,When I wear the mask my perspiration fogs the plastic and begins to sweat. It‚Äôs gross!!
1.0,"too small in the crotch, baggy everywhere else including the waist"
1.0,"I have no idea how it fits.  Material was thin, see through and stiff."
1.0,"I received my ear cuff thing much earlier than the estimated shipping. Unfortunately it doesn't fit correctly and when I took it off after trying it on once part of the ear piece broke. So, now I can wear it."
1.0,This was my husbands birthday gift they were supposed to be black but came to us white and he wont wear them i am very üò° i would like a refund or a different color
1.0,I was really disappointed with this one. It is very dull and tasteless. It looks better on the website
1.0,I order the couple's necklace with the cat and the fish and instead I got a cross and some Jewish symbols. I like the cross so I decided to not return the product but one star for the fact that I did not get what I paid for.
1.0,"Used as cleaning rags. Seams are crooked , they are short like belly  shirts and most seams were on out side of shirts CHEAP  dont"
1.0,The color looks fake
1.0,"Really cute! 3 stars because the left leg is sewn tighter than the right so I had to stretch it out.. Also, part of the lace isn't even attached! So I'm going to have to sew these back together, thankfully it's just a small spot.. Overall, I like them and am happy with my purchase. Just a couple minor fixes and they're good.<br /><br />Okay, adding onto this review. After wearing them once, I can hear it ripping every time I get into my car. And they fit me perfectly.. The tear on the lace was easy to fix but a few more have appeared. Of course. The fact that one leg is tighter than the other is really driving me crazy and I've tried everything to fix it. There are loose strings all over, and not just strings, the thick lace ones. And I didn't even receive the bracelet it advertises you should get with it.. No big deal, I wouldn't wear it anyway, it's just weird and ugly, but what bothers me is the empty promise there.. I am pretty disappointed cuz it is a really cute skirt.. I'd stick to buying in person so you know what you're truly buying."
1.0,"Couldn't even get this ""XL"" over my head and I wear XL in all my shirts. Also noticed it is COMPLETELY transparent. Not a little bit, but completely sheer."
1.0,So this is definitely not a dress too short in the front to be a dress. Did not fit like a 3xl at all
1.0,"No shoulders at all, seams are cut super awkwardly. Runs SUPER small. Struck out on this one üòï"
1.0,Sadly the first Amazon Prime delivered piece of clothing I have purchased that was nothing like the photo.  Don't waste your money the fabric is cheap the fit is huge and baggy and the sleeves look absolutely nothing like the photograph
1.0,Unbelievable that you still this photo from this website and it's not even polka dots it's actually flowers!
1.0,Fake diamond fell off first day. Waste of money. I want refund.
1.0,these are about half the length that the pictures shows.
1.0,Lost two stones on first wearing. Complete junk.
1.0,"Looks and feels really cheap. Does not even look like the same fabric that is pictured. Pretty shapeless, felt like I was wearing a sack. Runs big."
1.0,My 4 year old was so excited only to find out they wouldn‚Äôt charge. And after an hr one shoe stoped working ‚òπÔ∏è
1.0,The string came out and the pants don‚Äôt stay up at all. They are also see thru.
1.0,They hurt my ears and also turned my skin green.
1.0,Hurt my feet!! Tried to wear with socks that was a big no for me too. Wanted to love these since I have all hard wood floors and work in my kitchen all day but these hurt my feet even more Will have to find something else
1.0,sleeves were ridiculously small!!!
1.0,"This is the third time that I owned a Glo Bag. I used to rave about my first and second bag, and turned many people at my gym onto it. But with each new version, the quality is worse. My most recent bag didn't even last a year.  The inner snaps all ripped off and the shoulder strap ripped, as others have mentioned.<br /><br />It's too bad. I was a devoted fan of this company."
1.0,"I purchased zoomies after watching a tv commercial.<br />Don't get them, they are very cheaply made, they don't work very well and the magnification is barely better than using just you're eyesight.<br />I wish I hadn't wasted my money, but I won't try to collect a refund, as they keep the shipping and handling and its not worth the return shipping for a few bucks.....<br />DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY!!"
1.0,Don't waste your money or time waiting for this item unless you are looking for a cheap one-time wear. I didn't even wear it for more than 10 minutes and it was so uncomfortable and the cups were everywhere. Save yourself and go to Victoria secret and spend the extra 15 bucks!
1.0,Doesn't hold.  Provides no support
1.0,"i had that purse for 3 days and the zipper  brok, realy after 3 days,"
1.0,"Honestly, this is the most ill fitting, unflattering item of clothing I have ever purchased in my 41 years.  I do not recommend it AT ALL... unless you want to look like a shiny, frumpy tablecloth!"
1.0,After 4 days the straps started to rip. Don‚Äôt buy this item.
1.0,Not true to size. Ordered normal size for my daughter and were way too big. One shoe came damaged in the package. The footbed had apparent cuts where you could see the next gray layer under the top pink cushion. Was so disappointed since most reviews were great.
1.0,Way too small even with measuring provided. Very short in the torso length. Will not recommend
1.0,This caused an irritation to my nose piercing
1.0,"Horrible material, looks comfortable but it‚Äôs not. Shrinks when washed and way too uncomfortable"
1.0,Completely disappointed with this sweater. The only thing I liked were the colors. The material was extremely thin on the sweater part. Thin enough I could see through it as soon as I pulled it out of the package. The sewing where the two materials was really rough and there were tons of strings hanging out everywhere. And the sizing was very very large. It was honestly closer to a mens 2XL.
1.0,I only got 1 of each earring. Double check the box.
1.0,The dress in the picture was nothing like the dress I received & it looked cheap & felt cheap. I thought I might use it as a Halloween costume which is what the material felt like
1.0,This things are horrible I  throw  then way  my finger hurt they feeel like you have rubber band in ur hand
1.0,Offers no compression whatsoever; no more than wearing a shirt made out of panty hose
1.0,This hat was advertised for an infant. It was way to big for my fianc√©'s head.
1.0,Rough edges and broke really quick
1.0,"Uncomfortable, did not stay in place. Couldn't wear it."
1.0,"Love the pin, but I only wore it a couple of times and it broke."
1.0,"Not worth the money spent!  Key pendant is thin and small, chain is  disproportionately long.  Finish look like tin instead of sterling silver.  I was dissappointed. Sorry."
1.0,shoes do not fit as expected. Although we choose the regular size of the othre shoes this one was too small. The finish of the product was not of a good durable shoes.
1.0,"I was hopeful, but these are super cheesy looking and I won't likely ever wear them.  You get what you pay for here."
1.0,"I waited 4 weeks for my ring. I was really excited to receive it. I NEVER buy jewelry for myself, ever. When the ring arrived, I was happy with the ring (metal) portion of it. The tongs that hold the ""stone"": in place were a tad roungh on my skin, but I am sure wear would have smoothed that.<br />but the stone...IT IS FAKE. So clearly FAKE, and a really bad one. Cleary plastic or some kind of resin. At the price that I was paying and the small size of the stone, I thought that I would be getting a real stone, its FAKE.<br />BUY FROM SOMEONE ELSE- THEY SELL FAKES>"
1.0,"Was cute when I first got them I went swimming and let them in the sun and then shrunk, very disappointed"
1.0,Very disappointed in this item.  Belt was at too small and not sized correctly.  Over priced and cheaply made.  Sent back upon receipt.
1.0,"Although the earrings look very nice, and I bought 2 pair for my wife... whatever metal is used is NO BUENO! Her ears are raw and crusty not to mention the 2 days she wore them she woke up with swollen eyes! I'm only writing this review because I can't seem to contact the seller- so please beware of these metal plugs!"
1.0,They are made from very thin cloth.  No padding at all.  I got the small ones yet they still slide down during the course of the day.
1.0,Small as hell. Not true to size. If your a 10 get a size 12. You‚Äôve been warned.
1.0,I got it on Friday and fall apart on Wednesday  price says it all ... looked great for almost a week
1.0,I returned it.. it‚Äôs not tee shirt material I learned from this experience to read closer to details
1.0,"it barely looks like Hillary Cllinton when it's in the package, and when it's on, the person looks more like Voldemort because it is so tight that it pushes the nose down.  Also very difficult to see through the material that covers eye holes.  Returning the product."
1.0,Is this a pair of earrings or just one side? I received mine today and it was just one earring. I'm extremely displeased. Will be returning for sure
1.0,I didnt like this waist trainer because it did not make my stomach flat as I thought it would. However it is good for back support.
1.0,"The top doesn‚Äôt look like the picture, the fabric smells bad, and there was a hole in it."
1.0,This dress is a waste of money!! First of all when I received the dress it was thrown inside the bag inside out. Secondly the material is really cheap and felt like I was wearing cardboard. Third thing I disliked was it had deodorant stains on it. I am returning this dress dress ASAP.
1.0,"I ordered an XL, and it looks like it would fit a small child."
1.0,Not supportive at all
1.0,Cheap. Just cheap looking shoes. Poor quality. Payless would have been better.
1.0,"Went on a cruise, and stopped at different islands.  Jamaica had these ""net coverups for bicycle shorts.  Much thicker than what I purchased, many colors, and half gloves to match.  My Granddaughter bought these coverups in Jamaica, but I was shopping elsewhere and did not see them until we got back to the ship.  They are not carried here in the US- only thing I found seem to be for strippers.  Too thin, not cute."
1.0,Just ugh gross
1.0,This is just transparent plastic no blue filtering or any protection
1.0,The color on the picture is nothing like the actual one they send me i ordered dusty rose they sent me a bright pink one !
1.0,Garbage quality. Sock has a hole in the toe after being worn for one day.
1.0,I bought these for my 11 year old in size 10/12.  She tried them on and they did NOT fit.  WAY too small!<br />Would NOT recommend!!!!  Only if you get 1 or 2 sizes up will it fit!!!!!!
1.0,the CHAIN BROKE. s***ty ass purse
1.0,"The photo shows a high quality looking-like longsleeve, but in reality it is a 1$ shirt with low low quality print on the back. VERY disappointing."
1.0,cheap crap.
1.0,When you first buy it is cold out of the package after that regular material
1.0,The eyes are not diamonds they are black very disappointed
1.0,"Ordered a 40D, fits more like a 32B"
1.0,What I liked about it is nothing. It wasn‚Äôt like anything that I had seen before. Total slop job.
1.0,It said one size fit all but came shown xlarge! It was very uncomfortable and very rough itchy materials.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.
1.0,XL fit my daughter that's at 9/10 not true to size
1.0,"Nothing small or slim about size small. You you could probably fit 2 of me in this sweater. Baggy chest, waist, arms."
1.0,"This is how they gloves arrive today.. They where for my 84 year old mother no instructions whatsoever . I even tried to look past the condition and spent $13 on batteries to ensure she had plenty. The gloves were Luke warm at best. Will be returning tomorrow. My mom really needed the gloves for her arthritis and diabetic nerve pain in her hands that keep her up most nights in pain. I have bought at least 100 items from Amazon and have never felt the need to Write  a negative report, even when o returned the item ."
1.0,The bottoms are cheeky and butt hangs out. They didn't mention this on the website description. This was brought for a teenager.
1.0,Just make it yourself
1.0,"I really thought for the price I'd be getting better quality eyeballs.  I was a little shocked at how small they are and that they were not a full eyeball, but just a half eyeball.  I'd send them back but they would charge me shipping!"
1.0,"It was a gift and it was not a low rise, whatever that is, so it was sent back"
1.0,Bag wasn't even the color I selected. Why have options of choosing color if your not going to send what was selected? There is no way this bag is 60 L more like 40L. It seems to be a good bag but description is very misleading. Internal frame more like thin metal sticks.
1.0,Very beautiful! Only reason I didn‚Äôt rate 5 stars was because it‚Äôs slightly bigger than I was hoping. Well worth the money though! Great value and super pretty!<br /><br />Edit: do not buy!!! Each of the studs fell out over a couple of weeks time! They fell in my ear and I had to dig them out. Very disappointed.
1.0,Item Came broken. Zipper won‚Äôt work and the coach leather tag that normally is attached by an chain came unattached and without a chain. Highly disappointed
1.0,It is not the same dress as on the picture or description. Wasted my money will never even wear it out its that ugly...
1.0,Don't do it. High sole sides make your feet curl up and they offer zero support. Knees ached after a few minutes. Not worth it.
1.0,The lenses were installed backwards! Requested a refund and an waiting for a reply. I should have trusted the reviews and there was one buyer who commented the lenses were backwards.
1.0,Ordered this shirt for my daughter to wear at her birthday party. Ordered XL which would normally fit her long and baggy. This shirt was short and tight. Was very surprised considering it was a Gilden T-shirt. Especially since it‚Äôs suppose to be unisex which usually run a little bigger. Definitely disappointed!! No time to return.
1.0,I was so bummed to receive these. I ordered a size 9 - they‚Äôre smaller and narrower than a size 8.
1.0,"Bought a XL for my husband as a gift. He tried it on and it fit like a XL. Washed it once, shrunk to a small. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"they didn‚Äôt look nice at all. the ankle area was so wide that the shoes looked weird. the boots were very thin but not in a light way, more like a ‚Äúi could poke through this with an unsharpened pencil‚Äù kinda way. i returned them and still haven‚Äôt gotten the money back. i‚Äôm salty bout it tbh"
1.0,Kept erasing my MetroCard.
1.0,Sent wrong size. Poorly made
1.0,"After first wash after a week of use sewing came apart on hem and both lock holder on neck, lots of static. Very weak sewing on neck area and bottom hem."
1.0,Not a very good product. The reviews looked promising but the product is very flimsy and just falls apart as soon as you wash your hands. So if you don‚Äôt plan on washing your hands after using the bathroom then I guess this product will be fine.
1.0,Didn't need the band but they will not accept returns.  Keep in mind if ordering one.
1.0,Not a good product broke right away not happy and they won't let me give it no stars so I have to give it one star sucks
1.0,Cheap plastic watch. Broke in 4 months. SMH
1.0,The dress I received looked ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like the photo!!! Only 1 star and that's ONLY!!!!!!! for fast delivery üñïüèº
1.0,"These looked good in the picture, but the straps are cheap plastic, not leather.  Way overpriced for what they are"
1.0,I had a pair of these I bought locally for about 3 years. I unfortunately misplaced them. Looked multiple places locally again unfortunately not available. Really wanted grey but blue was fine. The newer one are awful I use them driving my car to work in the winter. The grips come right off driving the car. Never had that problem with my old ones.
1.0,"I followed the instructions and soaked the shoes. I saw this didn't work so I tried again with more of the product in the water, still no change. Now I have made my shoes all wet for nothing and hope they stay in shape for my next try with something else."
1.0,"I hated the boning on the sides, if I wanted to get a wireless bra I would get one. Really want my money back. Not worth it"
1.0,The length was not as long as I like.
1.0,"Be sure to check your ""fit"" model number on phone app, apparently fit 2 have a couple of sizes. This band did not work with my R370 model."
1.0,"Ordered on July 28, Product arrived today, August 24th, broken and you can not read the words on it. It is Extremely poor quality. And I‚Äôm not even sure the shipping label is valid, also says postage required, and will probably cost more to return it than the item is worth. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
1.0,"Came with a lot of stains..I washed it, and kept..because is a New Year present..no time to order another one.."
1.0,"The glove itself was fine, but the felt fabric had already fallen off before I received the package. They were only $4.95, but wouldn't recommend for a full night out."
1.0,Lets just say that you get what you pay for . The watch is made very cheaply and the first time I wore it the clasp broke .
1.0,"Washed once (per instructions on the tag) and now the padding in the bra is all stuck on one side. I'd have to cut the bra open to fix it. After one wash, the bra is effectively useless."
1.0,"I want to start by saying I ordered the right size according to the chart, so that wasn't a factor.  Overall, it's snug.  The sleeves are too short (shocking, because usually they are too long for me).  It isn't see through, and it looks like the picture.<br /><br />I don't know what it is specifically, but it just doesn't feel right.  Maybe it's because it's too snug and satin isn't forgiving, or maybe it's the shoulder puffiness.  Or maybe it's how loose the buttons feel."
1.0,They weren't matte at all. Not what I expected.
1.0,"i bought this for my boss for christmas and i like the look of it, but when it arrived 2 of the crystals had fallen out, very disappointing."
1.0,Washed in cold water with a medium heat to dry and shrunk so much it is unwearable.
1.0,5 to 6 inches longer than it appears to be in the picture
1.0,The threading started coming apart the second time wearing them
1.0,"Ordered, returned, ordered, returned! I wear a size 8 and a xxlarge was still too small."
1.0,This pendant was nothing like the picture.  It was 3/8 of an inch tall and very crudely made.  The metal was very rough and not shiny at all.
1.0,When I received the tip it had a big run across the front and was poorly made. Zero stars. Sending it back
1.0,"This shirt is too short!  Even if I wore a tank underneath of this, it would still look so completely awkward because this shirt is just too short.  It looks terrible and I don't like the way it fits.  They won't exchange this or let me send it back, so I'm stuck with it..."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:14a26c170cc44cd1d2516ca7be2b7e6f]] I got what I paid for ,for the price"
1.0,"Not real thrilled, picture given does not match the quality..."
1.0,"El paquete nunca lleg√≥, me dijeron que lo hab√≠an dejado en la sala de correos y ah√≠ no hay nada! Quiero me devuelvan el dinero, estafa total"
1.0,"I don't really like quality, I had to return it."
1.0,"Nice material, but the color was all wrong. Supposed to be blue gray. It's light green. Other reviews said it runs SMALL, so I ordered an extra large. I could barely fit my arms in! Color and size are way off! Very disappointed, will be returning!"
1.0,No es la tela que esperaba
1.0,They are comfy BUT not warm and see-through!
1.0,This item looks nothing like what is in the picture. It couldn't look more dissimilar if it had been put together by blind squirrels.
1.0,"Rather ironic, made in China. Tossing<br />Zero stars"
1.0,Cheaply made  it fogs up very easly not worth the money
1.0,"I purchased two sets of these, one for myself and another to go along with a charm bracelet I purchased my 7 yr old daughter for Christmas.<br /><br />I immediately put them on my bracelet and they fit perfectly - here is my bracelet [[ASIN:B019PFHSYG Stainless Steel Starter Charm Bracelet Barrel Snap Clasp Unscrew END Fits Pandora Charms (7.5 inch)]]. However, the next day one fell off at some point and it is completely lost now.<br /><br />I gave my daughter her bracelet with several charms on Christmas Eve, they did not fit her bracelet perfectly like they did mine. The diameter of her bracelet was smaller, this is hers [[ASIN:B01H7HSKY6 6 Inch Sterling Silver Plated &#34;Love&#34; Snap Barrel Clasp Snake Chain European Charm Bracelet For Kids/Children]]. They did fit over the two raised areas, I'm not sure what they are called. Anyway, yesterday (12/28) one of hers fell off at some point causing her to lose two charms. I believe hers fell off at home so I'm hoping I can locate the lost charms. If I can't then these cheap stopper charms are going to turn into a very expensive investment.<br /><br />I am an avid Amazon shopper and like that I can get mid-range quality for a good price, but save yourself the trouble with this cheap item and look elsewhere before they cost you more in lost charms."
1.0,They are really thin and run very small
1.0,"For some reason, these sunglasses are completely flat and give me vertigo!"
1.0,"They lasted less than a week.  Cute, but not worth the $"
1.0,Way too small and very long.  I wear this type of knit blouse with suits in Florida most of the year.  Comfortable and easy care.  All of the shirts I ordered recently were way too small and too long to wear with a jacket.<br />I usually wear a medium; read the reviews that they run small and ordered a large.  I would need at least an extra large in this shirt.  That's 2 or more sizes bigger than I usually order!
1.0,Arms are cut way too tiny it‚Äôs just ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1.0,"Disappointing‚Ä¶ While the socks appear to be made very well, there is not support in the ankle as stated In the description.  If you are looking only for arch support this may be your product."
1.0,It didn‚Äôt even fit my wife who is 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 120 lbs.  These were from china most likely going to get corvid-19...
1.0,"These were not the earrings I recieved. I recieved cubic zirconias instead, sent a picture of the proof and still was not refunded the money. This ordeal happened last week. I'd like my refund back asap"
1.0,"I have an XL. Usually where a size 10. sleeves are too tight. Rather long for my 5'7&#34; height, but doable with heels."
1.0,Please be aware. This is a boys size sweatshirt. Please update the title.<br />No one reads descriptions.  Thank you for updating the product.
1.0,I‚Äôve had these shoes for three months. My daughter has a gross motor delay so she doesn‚Äôt actually walk yet. The sole is peeling off. Very disappointed.
1.0,Belt was awesome until the river fell out of the buckle and rendered it useless. Only wore it for two weeks.
1.0,made really small thru the bust area
1.0,"Gave it as a gift, but it was after the 30 days. Couldn‚Äôt keep it working"
1.0,"I ordered 2 of these for my daughters, who are the same size. One was OK - the other was WAAAYYYYYY too small - and I ordered exactly the same thing, same size, just a different color. Not happy."
1.0,"Cheap & not like the pic....this will be my last time ordering any clothes being shipped from China....They are stealing pics off retailers websites & passing it as their own. That is dishonest & misleading, you will not get the dress you see in the pic, it will be a bootleg cheap quality version that is too short & nowhere  near true to size and cheap material."
1.0,They are not made for the 007.  They do not work with it.
1.0,Top small
1.0,"Needed it for my 97 yr old father.  The picture looks like the face is easy-to-read.  It's not.  There's no green, high-contrast numbers.  It's unreadable."
1.0,"My wife wears medium size clothes. I buy for her all the time. The medium I ordered, though labeled medium was extra small. I then ordered an extra large. It was labeled X-Large but was smaller than a medium. Very disappointed. Too much trouble to send back. Gave to my granddaughters."
1.0,Fits fine. It is too thin for a light color so I can't and haven't ever worn it.
1.0,Heavy polyester blend. Not as described
1.0,I ordered the size that corresponeded with my daughters shoe size and they were way too big. Because I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion I contacted the seller to exchange for a different size and after 1 reply they never answered again.
1.0,Is not at all like a compression material. More like a thin material work out material. Not sure why it is listed as compression
1.0,"Although these were an Amazon Choice product,they are awful. They are all twisted,stretched and beyond usable. Do yourself a favor ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt!"
1.0,"Big no star rating!  These are a joke!  Makes nothing clearer, Day or night!  Bought 2 pairs.  One for a gift.  Embarrassing!"
1.0,Not as good as it looked in picture
1.0,"This was a nice looking band. However, the locking mechanism was faulty. It would not stay closed. Consequently, my watch kept falling off.<br /><br />I sent this back."
1.0,Christmas present for work gift exchange
1.0,This dress was disappointing for me. The size was not accurate via the size chart given.  The color was much deeper than the description and the way it  portrays on line.  And the fabric is not soft at all.  I did NOT wear this for the event I had purchased it for.  Also the top is not flattering for anyone medium or small breasted.  Not at all.  Price was perfect for my wallet  but I now understand why.
1.0,Scratches all over the coin. Was hoping for a coin to display 101 proud but was highly disappointed
1.0,very cheap feel to them
1.0,"It's been almost 8 months that I have used this wallet and I must say I am quite disappointed in it. The durability is awful. The hinge lost a pin within a couple of months, and the plastic card holding baffles inside has split apart. Also, the clasp doesn't hold it closed if you drop the wallet. All in all, I wasted $20."
1.0,"I love the idea of the hood which is why I purchased this.  However, the hood does not reach down as far as the pictures show.  I could not, no matter how hard I stretched it, get the hood to go down over my eyes.  Not a huge deal, I was able to turn the pillow from one side to the other to block the view of something bothering me like an open window with bright sunshine flooding in while I'm trying to sleep or some annoying reading light.  The worst part is that the back of the pillow is too thick and it threw my head forward when I fell asleep.  There is no way to get the thing to not thrust your head forward.  Once you relax the foam expands in the back and boom, defeats the purpose completely.  Don't buy until they modify the back of the foam to a slimmer form."
1.0,Disappointing. Color was peachy orange. Not even in the shade of red. The pictured appeared burgendy red that was why I ordered it
1.0,These looked really great but broke before a week was even up. I was pretty disappointed. I have ordered from this company before and never had this trouble.
1.0,"I so wish I could give this 0 stars, its less then a month old and it broke, complete waste of money"
1.0,Might work for kids but for an adult they are worthless
1.0,"The description says this came as a set of 2, but only 1 necklace was in the box. I will not return because my daughter has already fallen in love with the butterfly. Hope you have a better experience than I did."
1.0,The colors bled on the shirt so that the sleeves are now pink. The material is not soft. The shirt is stiff with giant seams similar to the fabric you would find covering a car seat..
1.0,My shirt cane with a little hole in it right in front. Also the size runs very small
1.0,So small sucks ass<br />legs very wobbly<br />Poor construction
1.0,I will be returning it.  It wasn‚Äôt what was expected according to the picture.
1.0,"It looked so great in the picture...but what a disaster in reality. The shirt has zero shape...well, I take that back...it's boxy...so technically that's a shape, just not a desirable one. The material is so cheap and the pattern just doesn't look the same...something is way off. And the sleeves...omg, I seriously looked like my Grandmother. Immediate return."
1.0,"Super cheap quality , generic , returning"
1.0,These anti fog goggles are the worst.  They were fine for a few swims and then they went downhill fast.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
1.0,I Ordered a 3-4 for my 3 year old and it came like A 6 Month old very Upset
1.0,"First 15 days it was as expected Fog proof,fit nicely, no leakage and all, but after 15 days its totally opposite. No More Fog Proof, leakage start before going from one end to other end in big summing pool. Over all not a good by and not happy with quality."
1.0,"When I ordered it I expected it to be my size. Instead you have to bend the ring ""weaking the metal"" to size. If I wanted a size 8 I would have ordered a size 8."
1.0,The chain fell off within the first couple days and the color was not as expected.
1.0,I thought it looked really nice but from it saying 3x and it's really not more like a large not 3x no we're close it and it's super thin
1.0,I‚Äôm not crazy about these. They appear to be of low quality. They tarnish. Very fragile. I don‚Äôt recommend.
1.0,Very disappointed with how this fit. I definitely should have gone up a size because the material had no give whatsoever.
1.0,Not meant for a man or someone over 8 years old.<br /><br />This bracelet doesn‚Äôt fit a wrist of a teen or man. The fit is extremely small and doesn‚Äôt come close to fitting my nephews wrist (He‚Äôs a 100 lb 13 year old boy with skinny wrists)<br /><br />Stay away from this product.
1.0,more red then burgundy
1.0,Way too small. More like a shirt
1.0,Lasted exactly one day. Paint chipped off the ball completely!
1.0,ordered a large and received a medium so did not fit!!
1.0,These pajamas have a tight elastic band around you thighs. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,Advertised as SIX clip suspenders but when received they were ONLY THREE!!! Very disappointed needed for tuxedo. Will need to find elsewhere. Poor advertising.
1.0,Very Disappointed! Didn't Fit As Expected! False Advertisement If You Ask Me! Never Again Will I Order These Small Socks!
1.0,"It doesn't fit just anyone's ear. It didn't fit mine, and months later I still, have never worn it"
1.0,its clunky and moves around alot when you wear it so the backside (which isn't pretty) shows a lot.
1.0,"Covered in stains!<br />The shirt vest and shorts looked like they all had been worn before and rolled up in a ball, the tags had been cut out as well.  Made of extremely cheap material."
1.0,Apparently they forgot to sew in the &#34;cold shoulder&#34; part of this top. Looks nothing like picture and material is awful. Returning.
1.0,Makes you feel like you're in a potato sack. And we got the 3x L
1.0,Yoga pants ripped in 1 day. Material is very cheap and thin. Not worth the price. Shop around.
1.0,Material was as spandex as I expected
1.0,como su nombre lo dise desechables no duran y algunos venian rotos.
1.0,"Disappointed, this was extremely small. I purchased 2xl. Will have to give it away because it took so long to arrive doesn't make sense sending it back"
1.0,not the right size at all and material is really thin. don't like this at all
1.0,"This has a really odd fit. I'm more of a straight body type, yet this pants is fitted around the butt but loose at the waist. The worst thing is the rough stitching across the middle of the legs that makes it REALLY uncomfortable when bending legs."
1.0,This is a joke NOTHING like the picture
1.0,WAYY too small. I got a 2x and my sister who is a size 2 can't even wear it the size chat is not correct.
1.0,These pants are LONG! I mean from my chest all the way covering my feet long. I ordered the small and they fit in the waist just fine. The red is more of a neon red/orange.
1.0,"I actually love these sunglasses. Which is why I ordered 8 pairs of them. The description says ""set of 4"" and the price (roughly $32) was appropriate for 4 pairs, and similar to what I used to pay at walmart. I ordered two sets of 4. Instead of 8 pairs of sunglasses, I got two pairs. These are good (cheap walmart) sunglasses, and I like them, but not enough to pay $32 per pair."
1.0,"Came missing stones, bent, POOR quality."
1.0,"SHIPS FROM CHINA. THE SUBTITLE DESCRIPTION SAYS ""COTTON"" BUT THE FINE PRINT SAYS NTLON COTTON BLEND... IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE A MASK THIS NOT EFFECTIVE.<br />AD IS DECEPTIVE, BEWARE!"
1.0,I gave it a 1 star because the size of the cuff was too small. But it came in the mail accordingly
1.0,"I ordered this skirt and it was very delayed & then finally reported as LOST! So, believing in 2nd chances  I had reorder and when it arrived it looked as if it had been either worn or washed it had balls on the fabric that develop over time after wearing. The zipper has issues and was very difficult to zip up it would only zip. 1/2 way. The second skirt I ordered  same skirt came quickly & had the same Exact issue! A waste of $$$!!! Very unhappy."
1.0,Worked at first but slowly loses its ability to stay tight. Constantly is slipping now.
1.0,there is a bad odor when wearing the mask.
1.0,It is way shorter than it appears on this model and the sizing is off! Returned immediately.
1.0,Really pretty glasses but lenses aren‚Äôt very clear. Disappointed!
1.0,I wanted to like this dress but it was touching the ground and I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù. The bust was too tight also.
1.0,I received a hat that looks like a crumpled up taco. I tried everything to fix it but the material is stiff and not flexible.
1.0,This product does not compress anything!!! I ordered a 2X. Its slightly short in length and has a loose fit. I would not recommend nor purchase this product again!
1.0,Waist is too small and cuff is too large...
1.0,Silver was tarnished - looked like Thai silver rather than .925 sterling silver.  Red wooden beads bled on my wrist.
1.0,"Cheaply made, it was not what I expected it to be. Save your money, do not order."
1.0,Tore first time putting them on
1.0,Too big and fame looking
1.0,turned my neck green after only a few times wearing it.
1.0,"Broke first time of use, what more can I say?"
1.0,Super super thin and cheap.
1.0,The material and inside was wonderful but in fine print didn't see it there XXX small I don't think any woman is that small this is made for some kid did not fit at all what a shame I shouldn't even put a woman on there just for kids leggings
1.0,"Definitely Would not recommend, the sweater came with a weird smell and was way too tight. I normally order mediums in my sweaters and this was really rough and not comfortable. It was just way too tight."
1.0,"I liked the material of these panties, except they are made with this stretchy, plastic-y material around the edges that *squeezes* you at every edge and does not in any way provide an invisible/no-show look under clothes.  Rather, it creates a look where even the smallest bulges are strongly accented. I wear a size petite 0 or petite 2 in clothes, so typically XS would be the perfect fit for me.  But, when trying these on, it felt like I was being ""attacked"" by these panties because of how they cut in and squeeze at every edge...I couldn't get them off fast enough!  Try them on at your own risk. ;)"
1.0,This shirt is way too short. It‚Äôs very uncomfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 128 pounds. It‚Äôs like a shirt for children.
1.0,"Ugly and poor quality in person. Its suited to be a child's play thing, at best."
1.0,Did not like the acupressure earrings.  They kept falling off with just the slightest touch.  Not sturdy enough.
1.0,"This product arrived about 1 month late.  It‚Äôs poorly made and the material can be compared to an old slip (ladies undergarment).  Luckily, the price was refunded.  No stars but that‚Äôs not an option."
1.0,I don't think I bought this item
1.0,Cute but they arrived damaged the posts were extremely bent I straighten them enough to use them temporarily until I can get replacements
1.0,Well after 45 days the belt mechanism broke while wearing it. I would not recommend. Belt needed to be returned my March 28. Missed it by 14 days.
1.0,the flat design is great. not adjustable to head size. falling off when in use
1.0,Straps do not work to keep suction.
1.0,Cheap Quality material
1.0,This is the second coat that I bought for my daughter and it is extremely too small and I am very sad because I want her to have this before Christmas very very disappointing but the code is cute and looks warm
1.0,This doesn't fit a daith piercing as was advertised.
1.0,"First off, I wear a Misses size 14. Many said they fit small, so I purchased a 3X. My Gosh, they must be a child's 3X.  I mean, these look like a little girl's pair of jeans. Tried every which way to stretch them, or to stretch myself into them, no way is that going to happen. Please don't by these. They are not worth the money. I DIDN'T think anything on Amazon could  be this bad, or fit this bad, but there is always a first! Will donate them, or give them to my niece."
1.0,I have been sent 2 of these now and NEITHER WORK. I am hoping the 3rd one will work....
1.0,"Good price and nice if you are looking for very wide watch band; too big in general.  Bought it for my 91-yr-old mother and chose a brand that advertixed &#34;teen&#34; size thinking it would be smaller, but it was even bigger than the adult version I'd bought elsewhere previously.  Had to return it."
1.0,"This product discolord within days. I thought that it was sterling silver but after my husband wore it for a  couple of days, it turned an ugly pale greenish/grayish color. I am very disappointed and disatisfied."
1.0,This fit me like a potato sack
1.0,"The material is not what was described. I ordered a two pack that was perfect, so then I ordered the four pack, same soze, and they‚Äôre trash."
1.0,1) No interior or exterior base/floor. As a result it does not retain it's shape unless it is packed to maximum content and only then does it resemble the shape in the picture. It requires a hard plastic interior base. I am in search of a hard plastic that can be mounted to the bottom interior of the bag so it has a firm floor and helps retain it's shape. 2. No feet on the bottom of the bag to protect it from wear. In short time of use holes will wear in the<br /> bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Disappointing purchase.
1.0,This sukx don't waste ur money
1.0,Didn't last very long the stick stud from the back broke off the same day
1.0,I thought the ballerina logo was supposed to go right side up and not upside down ? ü§î<br />How hard is it do do your job.
1.0,The bracelet was broken!
1.0,"I'm 5'7, the fringe hit my waist. It's a pity, it's a pretty vest. If you were extremely slim and 5' tall, this would fit as it shows in the picture."
1.0,"They are smaller than stated, incredibly hard to get on and close, or keep closed. Do not waste your money."
1.0,"5‚Äô8, 160 lbs, big booty. I was so excited to order this but it‚Äôs too small and not as pictured. The material is satin-like,<br />The pants are well above your ankles. It has a weird fit as you need to pull it up high on your waist to completely zip it. I looked liked Urkel!!!"
1.0,These are completely see through! They‚Äôre really big too. I ordered a small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù5‚Äô and 108lbs. They were like clown pants. They would really go way above my waist.
1.0,There was only ONE ear in the earring & the back of the earring is dirty as it‚Äôs been worn before.
1.0,Size runs WAY too small
1.0,Hole is too small with plastic and too big without it! NO protection at all. Horrible!
1.0,The seller should match the product with the right picture!
1.0,"The second I unwrapped these, the webbing on one earring broke, making it drop its center bead. These are so cheaply made, that both earrings looked like they would completely fall apart at any second.  Also, these are LITERALLY the largest earrings I have EVER seen.  They go past my shoulders and are SO gaudy, making them totally unwearable. Do NOT waste your time or money on this horrible  product!!!"
1.0,2 stones were floating around in the baggy the earrings came in. Stone quality is awful as well
1.0,"Misleading, picture and description makes you think there's<br />Shimmer, rhinestones on it. Very disappointed."
1.0,way smaller than size said it would be cheap material
1.0,"I am 5'8"" and 150lbs - this was far too short, and also too big around the stomach. Sizing chart was very off."
1.0,Not nice at all.  Definitely regret buying it.. I threw it away because it was just not good....
1.0,These are very thin and too big for my face
1.0,Not my type
1.0,It doesn't not look like the picture yes the leggings are the same pattern but the shirt while yeah it's the same print the style of the shirt is a normal shirt not oversized at all and it doesn't hang off the shoulder like it shows.
1.0,I love the band.  The problem is the design is peeling off the band.  I have not had it that long so do not understand why this is happening.
1.0,"Hated it. I looked like a farmer. Wide on top, tight at the waist and wide and long at the bottom. Returning it ASAP. Just not for me."
1.0,This dress was poorly manufacture. It was not like the description at all. I sent it back. I would not wear that in public. Very disappointed.
1.0,"The hat sent to me is NOT the hat in the photograph.  I have ordered the hat in the photograph before and worn it for years.  When I recieved the new hat it is totally different.  The brim is much smaller and it is stitched so the brim is stuck in one position.  I ordered the hat because my wife had already bought me the new one for christmas and i did not like it.  Now I have 2 of them.  I know Coolibar stopped selling the original larger brim hat and so I was ordering it from this site because it showed the old one and i hoped they had some left but I was wrong.  The original hat was amazing, wore it restoring prairie for 3 years without any problems.  The new version is nowhere near as comfortable, flexible or effective at keeping the sun off me.  Please change the image so you stop false advertizing."
1.0,LOOKS NOTHIG LIKE THE PICTURE AT ALL SUPER TIGHT AND SYNTHETIC SO DISAAPOINTED
1.0,It's weird and I don't know how to put it on it does not stay at all I could supposed to like the picture says
1.0,This case does not fit correctly on my Lenovo smart tab M10. It is very hard to get on and once it is on it causes the tablet to bend in the middle and is very noticable. I immediately took it off for fear that it would damage my screen or leave a permanent bend. The flap does not reach back across completely either so there is a space of the tablet screen that is not protected. Very dissapointed in this product.
1.0,I expected a bit more support. Not impressed with the material. Seems flimsy.
1.0,Dislike. this is not the size i ordered. its too small and your return policy is all the way in January and i wanted it for halloween. I am unsatisfied
1.0,Suspenders didn‚Äôt stay clipped and the hat was for a tiny head
1.0,The actual clock looks just like the picture.  The chain though made me have an allergic reaction after wearing it for a few minutes.
1.0,"These bracelets smelled like mildew and chemicals. Absolutely unwearable, which is too bad, because they're super cool looking!"
1.0,I‚Äôm good love no thank you
1.0,"Not only is the mask material thick - which makes it difficult to breathe, it has a pocket in which you're supposed to put this plastic-y insert for extra protection, which literally smothers you.  Fortunately, I only bought it for May 4th (""May the fourth be with you."") for school, so I'll only wear it briefly once a year.  I'll stick with my regular masks for daily use."
1.0,"I've owned Coach sunglasses... These are very cheap compared to another pair.  Plastic, the Coach symbol isn't the same, this model number is different than the original number for the design. Returned"
1.0,hated the material
1.0,"Okay, so here we have one of the many low end NATO strap kits for our Suunto Core watches that are available at Amazon. I originally purchased this kit hoping that it was some how a better quality kit than the others but it's not. The difference between this kit and the cheaper priced ones is just that, the price...this kit costs much more.<br />  The band started to fray within a week of owning it and the ring holes started to fall apart as well. You'll notice that two of the ring holes have unacceptabe wear for just about a week of use. I could never seem to find a comfortable adjustment point, that's why two of the holes have wear. One adjustment was a tad too loose while the other was a tad too tight.<br />  In conclusion, I can't keep this strap. I don't see it lasting even a month at this rate.<br />I get that this is a cheap kit compared to a quality strap but why overpay for this in the first place."
1.0,"Like the title says, garbage. Letters literally fell off after 1 wash. Do not buy."
1.0,pretty piece but came broken
1.0,"These look like real sized belly button rings in the picture but they are so tiny and are pointless to wear. If you wanted anything cute, you wouldn't get these"
1.0,Engraving has a word misspelled
1.0,"These socks are about the size I would buy for a small boy. For a non-elastic sock they depend on something to offer an enormous amount of stretching. These socks, touted as winter, spring, fall socks, are thin to begin with and become see-through as you try to stretch them to fit an average sized man's foot. They look like pantyhose when/if you can get them on. Do not, for any reason, buy these socks! The only plus is that the company is willing to offer a refund, but you better have a printer to print out a return label. No paperwork comes with the socks."
1.0,"If I could leave no stars, I would. The necklace delivered was not the one I ordered. It does not glow in the dark. It will turn your skin green."
1.0,"Sooo disappointed with this dress. I ordered according to the size chart, XXL and could barely get one arm through a sleeve. This must have been made for a size 0-2. I contacted the seller who advised me to &#34;give it away&#34; due to the expense  of returning it to China. Ordering online can be a hit or miss, and this was definitely a miss. As American women are larger and taller than our Asian sisters, it would be nice if our US sizes were made true to size."
1.0,Bought this for my 13 year old DD. Item arrived defect - it is poorly made with a very flimsy metal wire
1.0,"The items is very pretty.  However, it is cheaply made. Once I put it on and tried to clamp it closed, it pulled apart and broke.  Pearls scattered... it was a mess.  Do not purchase.  It should be sold at $5 or less."
1.0,The color just faded.
1.0,"I would give this 0 stars if I could. The material was so see through you could see the color of my nipples, it wasn‚Äôt silky, and it was horribly made overall. Don‚Äôt bother."
1.0,"Same as in picture but the fit is not a good one in my face , the glasses move around when I run"
1.0,i love the look of this ring set. the only problem is that it changed colors within an hour of wearing it. my skin is reacting to the ring and it‚Äôs not even silver anymore! not worth the money i spent.
1.0,"I am usually a Medium in any brand, but this dress was way too big. The pattern also wasn't as flattering as it looked online. Very old lady like. Maybe it was because I got too large of a size, but the straps felt too long and created an awkward neckline."
1.0,Fits great bit stitching is poor. Ripped at the seams the 1st time my son wore them.
1.0,I never order this item .and I didn't it not I received it.
1.0,"Too bad, I like the look of the slipper but the arch is so high it throws off my step. Can't walk in them. Can't wear them."
1.0,!!Buyers beware!! I got these pins and as soon as I removed one flag from its packaging the backing/pin holder thing never stuck back onto the pin. All 4 were the same. The pins are nice but you can‚Äôt place them on anything.
1.0,Horrible! I ordered for a last minute vacation. It arrived on time and I packed it only to find out the there was a HUGE HOLE in it. Had to purchase another cover up on vacation.
1.0,I got size 5 and it's way bigger than expected.  Also not skinny more like between skinny and bootcut. Dislike how huge the waist was compared to the size and no way to adjuay the waist. Don't waste your money.
1.0,I wore these once and washed them. The fabric is so thin that it had 3 holes down the back seam. I could not believe it and knew that they would not take a return after I washed them. Buyer beware!
1.0,"Extremely disappointed. Stitching isn't centered,  and isn't straight. Looks terrible."
1.0,It didn't glow in the dark like the dark.
1.0,"I bought this ring because I wanted a  ring with my sons birthstone gem in it. I received it and was very excited as it is very unique and gorgeous. However I wore for only 5 hours, no major activity and heavy lifting or anything that would stress the ring, and happened to look down and one of the stones were gone. Amazons customer service is wonderful & helpful. Perhaps ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Maybe I just got the faulty product of them all , all the prongs looked great. I have no idea how the stone fell out."
1.0,The sixth month old fit a 30 pound two-year-old  the 3 t is huge there‚Äôs not enough fabric in the front tire a bow so I had to turn it around  it will be sent back tomorrow
1.0,"The boots arrived broken-the clasps for one of the straps came off, but more significantly, they absolutely reeked of something toxic! The smell was so strong it induced a headache and I had to remove them from our home as quickly as possible. When my husband came home, after only having opened the package 20 minutes before, he smelled the stench too, even commenting that it smelled strongly of marijuana! Use caution when buying these ""Boots for Toddlers and Little Kids""!"
1.0,"I did not get a short bolero, I got a full, short sleeved sweater that went down pas my butt.  Maybe it was a mistake, not sure, but I am returning it."
1.0,shirk when washed in cold water
1.0,Product of very poor quality
1.0,"The item is very cheaply made. You can feel it in the material and the look of it.  I really liked this costume when I saw the picture and wanted to get it for my little guy. At the time of ordering, this was the  only one in stock, so I ordered knowing the risk of it not coming in time for Halloween.  A few days later I saw the costume pop up with 2 day prime and ordered thinking I can return this one.  Nope,  customer service is a joke and the refund email I got back was extremely rude.  I wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping it or giving it to a friend but the quality of the costume SUCKS‚Äîcompared it to the other costume I got.  There was no padding in the costume,  the material is rough and the stitch is awful. Based on the cost and the customer service, I would NOT recommend this costume to anyone."
1.0,"These are the worst socks I've ever attempted to put on. They have no stretch and because they are tall get bunched up and are impossible to get over your heal, off or on. I'm looking to send them back for full refund."
1.0,They are too small to fit over the underwires . To be sure of this I pulled out thr whole wire and then tried and then it split when I pushed harder. Very disappointed. I will fine some kind of little metal caps instead. This is a life long problem
1.0,Look Cheap.
1.0,I have a 26&#34; waist and getting it buttoned felt like I was being squeezed to death. The pleating billows too much also making the skirt stand out rather than fall gracefully.
1.0,Poorest quality. Connecting magnet failed to stay mounted. Lens came loose. Terrible waste of money. AVOID AVOID AVOID
1.0,Don‚Äôt worst your money. I have a big nose it these were humongous on me.
1.0,Favorite dress!!<br /><br />UPDATE: washed in cold water and laid flat to dry and it shrunk to two sizes smaller. Bogus.
1.0,"Very low rise, much lower than the picture. Looked terrible on."
1.0,"Small cups, short torso, and too big on stomach area. I'm 5'7"" 175lbs and ordered a 2xl. The torso was short, the cups were tiny and the stomach area is super loose."
1.0,DO NOT BUY - it does NOT look like they described!
1.0,"When ordering, order at least 2 sizes bigger."
1.0,The hem came completely out of the shirt the first time I wore it
1.0,Poor watch material very handsome design but not useful.
1.0,The glasses I received weren‚Äôt as wide as I saw in the pictures posted by other customers. They sit tall on the face instead and fit poorly‚Äîseveral inches away from the eye so offer no real sun protection.  They also have a very campy look to them unlike the cool vibe I expected.  The worst part is I can‚Äôt return the item and that was not specified on the product seller. Now I‚Äôm out of $15 for an item I‚Äôll never use. So dissatisfied!
1.0,I was excited to receive these but they ripped at the seam on the butt literally the first time I wore them. And it's not because they were too big - I ordered a size up on purpose and they're a little loose on me. Super disappointed.
1.0,Not happy at all!! I bought two different sizes based on ALL the reviews. Seriously?!?! I have no idea who these fit properly but besides myself and 3 other friends ranging from 10 to 14 can‚Äôt fit either pair correctly. I am done
1.0,One of the stones was not attached. It was loose in the box!
1.0,Save your money on shipping and buy a better product from Walmart or Family Dollar. This cheaply made knock-off is different than shown online. It's a painted rubber boot that smells of hazardous materials. And not worth the time or money to attempt a return.... Consider yourself warned.
1.0,Chain is so thin
1.0,"watch tells time correctly however does not keep correct time,what can be done about it?"
1.0,These are meant to be about pleasure not pain these grab skin and then try to rip it the center is way too long almost seems to be made for a man as long as they are
1.0,Mine broke trying to put them in my shoelace holes my thumbs hurt so bad. they are very hard to get into your shoes and you can't pull on them too hard or they brake like-minded three times. Cheap!! Don't buy
1.0,Were not as shown. Were actually very cheap and ugly gaiters. Asked for a refund and was refunded quickly and easily
1.0,"This dress is cheaply constructed, and very ugly. It might look better if I went down a size from what I normally wear. A belt would also be a plus."
1.0,Way too small!! XL in womens fits my 4 year old. Ridiculous!!
1.0,One of them broke the first time I tried to put them on. :(
1.0,These things are tiny. Maybe would fit an 8 year old
1.0,"The material is very cheap, not white enough, the open-back is too large"
1.0,"The buckle is simply designed poorly. Since it is much higher than the stock Garmin bucket, it digs into your wrist when you wear it. I don't wear the watch too tight either but you need to have good contact for the sensors to work. Poor design. Don't buy."
1.0,It's very nice but it Is to transparent..
1.0,the ties on these shoes broke off after wearing 4 times üôÅ
1.0,underwire in the bra broke the 5th time I wore it.  I loved it until that happened
1.0,"I retuned these sunglasses because they looked really cheap and I seriously did not like anything about them. Im not sure if I received an ugly pair or something but the pair I received did not look anything like what I ordered. I bought these sunglasses after seeing all the positive reviews.<br />I hope I have been helpful. I did receive this product for free in exchange of my free unbiased review. However, my opinion is my on and by no means influenced by the seller. ¬†If I was helpful, please click the (Helpful!) button below"
1.0,Unfortunately I purchased this Along with another one captain America. For my two grandchildren.  Captain America a big hit had to buy another. For some reason neither liked spider man
1.0,FOR A DOLL SO  SMALL
1.0,It started to come apart the first time i wore it. I ended up throwing it away. As it probably would have cost more to return it then it cost me.
1.0,Not happy at all..
1.0,The lenses are nice but they do not fit the frame of the ‚ÄúOakley Badman‚Äù like the factory lenses they fit loose and have gaps.
1.0,I am not sure who this is built for. It was wide but short and the sleeves were too short. Didn‚Äôt look good at all.
1.0,It‚Äôs absolutly cute. Just like in the photo. The hardware connecting the purse to the bamboo handle broke the first time I used purse.
1.0,Broke after my sister in law wore it twice.
1.0,I received my vest. It's super cute and fits great but I plugged it in to charge and it didn't turn on after that. It's really too bad. I was looking forward to this vest.
1.0,Cute color but looked awful. I returned it.
1.0,"Purchase it for my baby sis in Carolina &she,s a big girl.she says it was beautiful but too small for her..even though it was an extra large."
1.0,Will not stay in your ears.
1.0,"Bag lasted 2 days before the shoulder strap broke.  It's also very heavy, even without anything in it."
1.0,"This is not for plus size or typical ‚ÄúXL‚Äù ladies. The XL was too small, I couldn‚Äôt put it on. Will be returning."
1.0,"small, cheap material"
1.0,"A hole in the toe after 4 days. I have carpeted floors, slippers were perfect size. There is no excuse for this. I didn‚Äôt want Walmart slippers, wanted something a bit better. Jokes on me."
1.0,This watch did not come with the charger or instructions. I took it upon myself to buy a charger for the watch instead of returning it and the thing won‚Äôt even charge after several hours of leaving it on the charger ! This was supposed to be a birthday gift for my daughter What a huge disappointment!
1.0,"I purchased the Olevs watch with the black face and day window. I was so excited for it, I had been looking all over for something that would fit my needs.  Aaaaaaand obviously when it finally arrived today I couldn‚Äôt wait to open it.<br />When I finally did I didn‚Äôt find any watch. But I did find an Amazon returns bag from Seattle Washington that was empty. So I didn‚Äôt get anything that I purchased and instead I got trash. What a mess. I‚Äôm so frustrated."
1.0,"This thing is enormous, bought it for my Medusa And couldn‚Äôt use it."
1.0,"After one wash, on gentle, the color faded and the material started sticking together. I had to throw it away after only wearing once."
1.0,"This was no way a 4X, it was more like a 10-12. My 12 year old can fit it. Not a plus size item at all."
1.0,"smaller than expected, looks cheap, I would NOT recommend."
1.0,This is very thin and the zipper broke immediately because it‚Äôs to thin and cheap. Overall poor quality.
1.0,"Please be aware! Do NOT buy this strapless bra. It's one of the worst strapless backless bra I bought. It didn't stick and keeps falling off from my chest. I have to keep holding it, to make sure it doesn't comes off. It was so annoying."
1.0,"I washed them in cold water. Took them out of the washer, not dryer, and the decals were stuck together."
1.0,Very scratchy almost like wool. Not at all comfortable
1.0,"Ilrigiy I had written a glowing review about the studs. But the customer service SUCKS!! One of the backs was kind of loose, it fell off and they are charging $20 plus $7 shipping. What a crock"
1.0,These are awful!! They were so small my child could wear them and they are a womens large. I washed them and all the strings came out and the seem<br />Came apart and left a hole. Honestly do not waste your money!!!
1.0,Weird fit even after following chart.. It rides up a lot bcuz of the material. The shoulder were too big and just looked weird. Didn't send it back bcuz of the hassle. I will be cutting the sleeves and fixing what I can and just wear it to bed. Looks cute but just doesn't fit right.. waste of money for me
1.0,Don't waste your money.  Junkie
1.0,The necklace came broken! Chain was broke. I received a refund atleast
1.0,This was very poor quality. I sent it back. It looks very plain and very cheap. I wouldn‚Äôt even wear it to upscale birthday party. It was nice and long but that‚Äôs it
1.0,"After wearing the glasses for two days (maybe 3-4 times) they slipped off my head in my apartment and the left side lens fell off, hope that the other pair I have isn't as &#34;brittle&#34;...won't be buying from them again.!!"
1.0,üòëüòê
1.0,Not worth the money tarnished within weeks of having it!!
1.0,"I purchased this pair of earrings last month and thought they were beautiful; however, after wearing them 6 times, one of the pearls dropped off, separated from the clasp.  I was so disappointed and question the quality and workmanship."
1.0,"These shoe/booties are cheaply made no arch support completely flat inside. ‚òπÔ∏è<br />stitching on the boots are also different than what The cellar had pictured.<br />Even if I had wanted to wear them I ordered a size 8 but was sent a size 38 and in European sizes it should have been a 39, so it was a little too snug to be comfortable.<br />Color was supposed to be gray more like a weird muddy brown. Thank goodness Amazon gave me a complete refund. üòä"
1.0,it arrived broken.  i was very disappointed.
1.0,This coat is great. Love it. Always wanted a fur coat But the real thing would coat a fortune.  The color and it's so soft. Love it.
1.0,"I received my necklace on Monday. It is a very pretty necklace. Fortunately it was note very expensive since it broke the first time I tried it on. It is incredibly dainty and it separated where the chain was attached to one of the circles. I considered reordering because the necklace is pretty but I am afraid it will break too easily, again. Too bad since I liked the philosophy of the necklace."
1.0,Mirroring rubs off easily
1.0,"Not giving this dress in the ad the one star, I'm giving the dress that I received a one star.  I didn't get what I paid for.  Instead, I received a longer dress, V neck that was sleeveless with thin white vertical lines and no belt.  I've never had any issues before so it was quite a shock when I opened my package and discovered a totally different look."
1.0,Daughter never wore for the summer because it is way to big for her. It could fit a plus size kid.
1.0,It made my belly button infected. Wouldn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt be buying these again
1.0,The button for adjusting the pant (I.e. the whole reason for buying these) was missing.  Good thing I'm handy with a needle and thread.<br />Disappointed.
1.0,"Soon after opening the box, I found a decent size rip near the base of the head that would not let it inflate. It was also near impossible to position my head properly inside. I would recommend steering clear of this. Returning mine after 5 minutes of use."
1.0,It does not fit on head like picture. It is very cheaply made and you can see glue all over it. It came apart as soon as I put it on my head
1.0,Way to dark to wear. It makes It unsafe to wear while driving. I returned them.
1.0,Total crap. See through and had a hole
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL AND NOT SLOUCHY. Literally is sized to fit a toddler!
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt able to even try broken!!
1.0,They were adorable right up until the hollow middle of the plugs started RUSTING. Not something you want on your ears!!!
1.0,"I ordered this jacket for my mother who wears a small and after reading other reviews ordered her a LARGE.  It does not even come together to close.  Very, very disappointed!!!!"
1.0,"I ordered this band about 10 days ago.  First, I was surprised that it seemed completely black even though, although labeled on its site as black, it was shown as a kind of dark gray, which frankly, I would have preferred as my watch is Space Gray.  But I tried it on and decided to keep it.  I'd ordered a few bands for my new Apple Watch and opted to wear another.  Tonight, I changed to this band because I thought I'd wear it tomorrow and wanted the watch ready to go in the morning.  I put it on to fit it and wore it around for an hour or so.  When I went to take it off, suddenly my skin was caught between the latch and the band, like a bite.  No matter which way I moved the latch, the ""bite"" tightened on my skin and I was afraid, aside from the pain, that it would literally take a chunk (NOT like a cut, like a chunk!) of skin out of the tender, underside of my wrist.  Finally, I had the idea of trying to work some lotion around the ""bite"" to see if I could get it to somehow slide off my skin.  I worked at it for about 10 minutes.  It was painful, and finally, to my great relief, success!  It came loose.  Now, maybe 30 minutes later, the site is still painful and it looks like I'll have a bruise and a tiny spot where the skin was broken, but I'm free!  I will NEVER use this band again--or any other by this manufacturer--and strongly advise everyone against buying it.  It may not happen to many people, but you surely do not want this to happen to you!  And let me be clear, there was no pinching or puckering or wrinkling of my skin when I first put it on.  I did fit it snugly because Apple tells you to do so in order for certain functions to work properly (like the ECG or blood oxygen level), but it seemed fine until I tried to take it off.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!!"
1.0,"These are super cheap, do not buy!! The internal screw part is so shallow it‚Äôs hard to get the opal ball onto the bar. I took the ball off before putting it in just to see how to do it and the actual part that screws onto the bar came off on the bar and now I can‚Äôt use the earring. I‚Äôm having to return it and am now stuck with my current crappy set up. Do not waste your money."
1.0,"The torso is so thin that 5 X size isn't wide enough for tummy at waist.  I am so disappointed,."
1.0,"Although the quality of the turtleneck was good, I was very disappointed in the color.  It is NOT a true red."
1.0,This is a nice dress however it‚Äôs sizing is incorrect. I ordered an extra large. When it arrived it appeared to be an extra small. I gave it to a Very petite co-worker. The sizes are not the American sizing and it should be stated
1.0,These boots run very small! Not at all happy.
1.0,Very poorly made. No seams on the shirt at all just stitching which means everything rolls up. Very disappointed.
1.0,I bought them for snake bites. Ended up taking them out now my snake bites are closed cuz of scar tissue issue cant use them in allergic even tho I had jaw surgery in the past and have surgical steel holding my jaw together but tissue has grown over the metal but I guess lip was way different.
1.0,It was supposed to be 100 keys there are only 95 keys witch shorts me on my project
1.0,Very flimsy and cheaply made
1.0,Not for a small head.
1.0,"Product arrived missing the most crucial part, the ratchet click part. Was unable to return since it was discovered past return date allowed."
1.0,"The boots are very flimsy, more like slippers than boots, good as house shoes but I'm going to have to buy a different pair of actual boots for my daughter to wear outdoors. Definitely won't be ordering Bebe brand again."
1.0,Character design is stolen the owner has not given consent to mass produce terrible quality knockoffs.
1.0,I like the earrings but one of the pairs was missing completely.
1.0,I would give these 0 stars if I could. I returned them because they run way too small. The bike shorts underneath creep up and are way shorter than they look in the photo or say in the info. The over short was tighter than the undershirt. Hot mess.
1.0,Glasses came scratched and looked used. üëéüëéüëé
1.0,Too small. Ordered 11.5 and received size 8.
1.0,Doesn't even deserve one star!  DONT BUY!!! Picture on mask was so blurry! Photo shown on Amazon is very deceiving!!!<br />Sent it back right away!!!!!
1.0,I have toilet paper thicker than this material. I never took it out of the bag when I felt and saw how crappy the robe was. Save your money.
1.0,"Sent wrong color , then after wearing for 1 day 2 different earrings stones fell out"
1.0,"too stretchy , the peacocks look horrible on it. Cheap cheap cheap"
1.0,The sizing was way off and I didn‚Äôt like the material. I returned it
1.0,"LOVE the design, VERY cheap quality. Snapped in half just putting in a glasses case!"
1.0,Very cheap and thin this is how I received it
1.0,"Muy lindo, pero el cuello demasiado peque√±o, la cabeza de Mi hija no entr√≥ z"
1.0,Personalization wasnt on it very sad
1.0,"Got a medium and it's way too small, very short. I think I'll wear it as a coverup or as a long shirt with shorts or leggings underneath"
1.0,These were supposed to be a gift and they came broken. I will spend an extra $5 and go get a new pair at Boot Barn instead.
1.0,Very small for its size
1.0,ALREADY LOST IT. WON'T STAY ON EAR.
1.0,Pathetic--
1.0,"Much bigger and square than expected. Lenders is orange, NOT YELLOW.<br />Definitely not what I thought I was getting."
1.0,Very disappointed!! Quality was cheap. Dress was more like a poor quality sweater. Sleeve was also a poor quality mesh fabric. Very badly made.
1.0,Terrible.  Lasted one day before zipper broke.<br />Would have been better off with a large zip lock freezer bag. Do not purchase
1.0,"This product is coming from China, so direct to recieve it a month after you order, and forget about returns! I emailed the seller 4 hours after ordering to try to cancel and didn't hear back for a week- after it had shipped of course. The material is cheap, and halloween costume ish. I doubt it will hold up through a more than a few hand washes."
1.0,very nice for low price
1.0,"I broke my Fibula and I bought Physix Gear brand socks to reduce swelling around the ankle. Those were very good socks, but on the expensive side. I was looking for an alternative due to cost, but Sunfung is not a good alternative.  Pressure is not enough on the foot and uneven above the ankle. These are better suited for sports wear."
1.0,I recently purchased this item and it looks nothing like the one on Sex and the City. It's very small and paper thin. Way overpriced!!!
1.0,"Came broken, watch fell apart as soon as I put it on,  I think there is a little metal piece missing."
1.0,"Really likes this, but in less than a month of occasional wear the metal has become rusty which is visible through the clear resin. Just missed the return window, otherwise I would return. Too bad because it is cute"
1.0,Not at all what I thought it would be.
1.0,Didnt fit right and shirt quality bad
1.0,I ordered an XL size for this product and it fits like it was medium. I'm 6ft and weigh about 170 so an XL shouldn't be a snug fit for me.
1.0,"Actually runs 2 to 3 sizes too small. Bought XL, fits like a medium at best"
1.0,"Top Band is higher in the front than the back, but somehow the leg openings are shorter in the back.  Leg openings have virtually no elastic.  Material feels ok but I'll probably throw these away rather than be uncomfortable in them all day."
1.0,Can't get it on...
1.0,Buyer beware. I bought these for an overseas trip and the zippers broke on two of them and had to throw them away.
1.0,JUNK...don't waste your money.
1.0,Entire top half of the dress is cut wrong the bottom half is fine.  Really wish i did'nt have to return it.
1.0,Very weird fit. Doesn‚Äôt cover anything nor does it look like the picture.
1.0,One of the wings were bent and broke off taking it out of package.
1.0,Stitching failed on first contact when sliding in passport at very first use. Worst stitching and seams I've ever seen.
1.0,"I bought this belt because my old beater leather belt was getting to gross for me, but the pins located on the sides (they're what make the clicking sounds) keep on falling out, and then eventually the entire buckle fell apart while I was wearing it. While I may have a faulty product, I personally cannot recommend it. Unfortunate too, because damn is it nice looking for the price."
1.0,The sizing is all wrong.  Way too small.
1.0,I never got this item when I ordered two other chains
1.0,"Trying to put this bathing suit on requires assistance to figure out the backstraps--weird looping things which are impossibly tight and difficult to fit over your shoulders until you finally get them on when they become ridiculously loose and floppy. Once you get it on, the back looks flappy (again, you'll get a second person to spend a good two minutes just readjusting the many straps) and the front looks... just bad. Somehow this bathing suit makes your chest look small while trying to show off as much of your breastbone as possible--basically it destroys your cleavage while being too revealing in a deeply unsexy way. The back can't decide whether it wants to be a thong or not--it doesn't help that you have to make the shoulder straps super tight in order to deal with the strappy back and too revealing front. It does actually stay on while swimming, so I suppose that allows me to give it one star instead of zero. I didn't return it because there was no defects (though the design is so shoddy that a defect may have made it better, not worse). There is basically no reason to get this bathing suit. The design is unflattering, it's not particularly comfortable, and the straps mean that your tan line will look weird."
1.0,"The dress was super short on me, and I am only 5'1&#34;.  Was not flattering at all.  Like the dress shrunk or something."
1.0,"The apron in the image is MUCH longer than the one I received. It barely fits my four year old who is pretty average height for his age. The material also feels like a cheap, vinyl tablecloth. The image is okay, colors are bright, but with the material being so cheap I highly doubt this will last long. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1.0,Just received these and they have obviously been used.  They smell horrible and are stained with someone‚Äôs nasty arm pit scum.
1.0,Poor quality. Full of defects.
1.0,Not what I thought which is my fault.  I thought it was a soft headband. But if you are looking for a scarf save your money and go to the dollar store
1.0,"I love the hood and the color BUT do not like the zippers on the pockets. They're very uncomfortable. It's almost like you need to wear an undershirt. The zippers wear against my skin. Sorry to say that as much as I want to, I don't like this top."
1.0,"I expected a tankini top when I ordered this, but it‚Äôs a one-piece with the bottom sewn to the top. Am returning."
1.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 165lbs and the bottoms were high waters unfortunately. The fitting is also weird, baggy in the groin area. Not too happy with this purchase. Waste of money"
1.0,Must set time zone.  No instructions how to do this.  Voice time is two hours different than correct time. Have been unable to correct this.  Am going to return watch as soon as I know where to send it
1.0,Very uncomfortable and cup size is way bigger then it says.
1.0,The depiction of the photo doesn‚Äôt match how it looks. The cross over of the straps makes it look like a racer back in the front. The straps kept sliding down even after tightening and I didn‚Äôt like it at all. It was returned.
1.0,Watch fell apart on my wrist couldn‚Äôt put it back together threw in the trash
1.0,Nope. Cheezy.
1.0,Amazon screw-up!  There was no place on the order placement that specified SIZE. I am 6'2&#34; 210lbs and have muscular lower legs. The socks I received wouldn't fit my 8 yr old child. They are way too thin and cannot be stretched to even begin to put them on. Is this a SCAM?
1.0,El art√≠culo no estaba bien todos aplastado y no me queda!
1.0,"Ok, I don't have anything good to say about this shirt.  It's way too small--about two sizes too small--it should be marked L, not XXL.  The fabric has no stretch and while it feels ok in your hands--like t-shirt fabric, when you get it on, it just feels icky on your skin--doesn't breathe and is a little scratchy.<br />Add to that the fact that the word ""Christmas"" is in black, on a very dark red background and it's virtually invisible.<br />This shirt is in the Goodwill pile."
1.0,I have never seen anyone sell a chain like this and I buy a lot of chain and this is a joke.  I didn't read it right because I have never even seen this.  1 foot for over 3 dollars. Way to rip your customers off.
1.0,Way larger then expected compared to other clothing companies with same size chart. Disappointed
1.0,Don't like the material and dose not fit well.. Hate it.. I'm not even going to give it away or spend any more money to return it.. Its going in the garbage and considered it a loss..
1.0,The fabric wmis so soft and luxurious. I just wish theory bottoms were included in the order. I do not know how to go about getting them because they were supposed to be a set! I hope someone contacts me and let's me know how I can get the Panama shorts that were included.
1.0,These shoes are very stiff and have no give.  The back of the shoe digs into the child's heel.  Cute but not practical.
1.0,It had no shape :(
1.0,"Fit well over glasses.  Not good for any bending over task, will fall off head."
1.0,Missing multiple sheets of stickers so we were missing half the RBs and WR. They misprinted the board so after round 10 it said 6. Lol this board was a joke.
1.0,"They slide off. They fit rather loose, but unfortunately slide off as I walk.  Maybe too short from toe to middle of foot."
1.0,Very cheap she hated it
1.0,The material feels cheap and soo thin. Overall do not recommend.
1.0,This fits like their size guide says and is lightweight and perfect!
1.0,The quality of this product is poorly made. These sunglasses are not even and they sit crooked on my face
1.0,Not 5.5 inches
1.0,poor quality material  nice color
1.0,I purchased the red band with paw prints as a gift and it looks so awful.  The band itself is cheap looking amd the red color is not consistent across the band. It is faded in most spots.
1.0,Worn the set a couple of times. Love the look but the ends pop off leaving a sharp edge. Down to one last bangle. Very poor quality.
1.0,Not the warmest gloves in 28 degrees
1.0,"I returned it! The material is silky polyester, not like sweatshirt material at all and looked cheap."
1.0,Put in the garage
1.0,It didn't look the same in 3D so it was regifted for another's personal style.
1.0,"This is ever so cute but extremely too small.  I will probably keep it as I am losing weight.  I lose 5-7 pounds a month and I think I will be able to wear it next winter.  Seriously, I am not making a joke.  Today's date is 10-10-16.  I will update this post later and let you know what I decided.  Oh, and I ordered this coat one size above my shirt size."
1.0,Didnot work at all
1.0,"I would not recommend purchasing these shirts if you intend on wearing them. Don‚Äôt waste your time. I would have rated them zero stars if possible. I purchased two pair. First pair ripped apart in the crotch area on a hike with the family (all the way from the seam to the zipper). Figuring that was a fluke, I returned and replaced them. I took the second pair out of the package and the leg ripped as I put them on the first time. Upon closer inspection, the crotch area was separating as well, again, out of the package without having been worn. If these were $5.00 I would be fine with that. However, these are not worth what they cost."
1.0,Not what it shows .
1.0,"The yellow was completely see through. Very thin and cheap material. They were stretchy enough, but had to wear something over them. Overall, I bought a cheap product, and I got poor quality. Kinda expected."
1.0,"The sandals are comfortable at first but if you start walking around with it, heal side sink in and the whole sandals seems flatter. My foot pain came back. I don‚Äôt recommend."
1.0,"The watch randomly stops keeping track of time despite being on a full wind and the pins keeping the strap on came off merely by walking. Now imagine losing one of the pin pieces on a busy New York street on a Friday evening as a result. YEAH, not fun."
1.0,Ehh! I wanted to like this. Barely blends up my already chopped spinach. I think I will return.
1.0,Dress was really small and not flowy like it looks in the picture. Also it was so sheer you could see everything underneath.
1.0,"if i could have keep the 7 dollars in my pocket, i would have, it was so cheap so no lost though. but this looks wayyyyyyy better in the picture"
1.0,Was really impressed at first but one of the three shirts basically tore in half the first time it was washed
1.0,Pants are burgundy and bow tie is bright red. It is also not attached and is one of the cheap bow tie collars you buy for your dog. Very dissatisfied. Was supposed to be a Holiday outfit and only bought this one because of the matching pants and tie.
1.0,The zipper was poorly sewn. There was a wrinkle in the stitching.  Also the fabric was very cheap feeling.  I had great difficulty getting a refund.
1.0,this is a child's set.
1.0,Caused severe redness and irritation
1.0,I ordered a 4X for a friend and her arms looked like sausages. This is not true to size AT ALL.
1.0,"I loved these sunglasses and used them a couple of times a week for four months.  Today the right temple hinge snapped and now they are gargbage.  No unusual usage, just putting them on and snap."
1.0,This bag lasted 6 months then broke apart on me little by little :(
1.0,Terrible quality. These unravelled and fell apart after one wash.
1.0,"See, the problem here was the way it was supposed to fit through your head, couldn't fit my head in!!!  No way, and I tried!!! Quality control should check this Major issue, thank god I'm handy with my sewing machine, cause I made it bigger so I can fit my head in the dress and actually see how it looked on me, which was not bad, I like it."
1.0,Horribly cheaply made. Completely flat design and looks and feels like thin tin. Soooo dissapointed. Will not be caught wearing these.
1.0,"The ears are MUCH smaller than pictured on the models.  The bow is different as well.  They are pretty, but way too small in ear size for a grown up."
1.0,Looks nothing like the photo. Made of really cheap material.
1.0,very thin cheap shorts.. not good quality at all
1.0,Terrible material. It was so hard and stuff even after I washed it twice. I do not recommend this product.
1.0,It was 2 small
1.0,"It is a nice piece of jewelry as long as you don't use it, very flimsy. The hinges are weak and I would not buy another one."
1.0,Terrible quality.. strap broke after only wearing twice! Don't waste your money on these tanks.
1.0,"I loved these! Super nice. However, my first pair splintered after 2 wears. They replaced them which was great. The 2nd pair lasted less than 60 days üòí. Splintered in the grain like the last ones. I'm really disappointed. The warranty on them is only 30 days. I would have liked to at least get the whole summer out of them. Ive had dollar store pairs last way longer than these."
1.0,I have bought this brand before and a large fit but these after they were washed were two sizes too small. Very disappointed.
1.0,This socks arrived quickly.  The variety of patterns and colors is delightful... However - these have to be the worse socks I have ever purchased.  They are so thin that in less than 6 hours of wear - in house slippers - one sock developed a hole!  Also the back/heel of the sock rides so low the socks didn't stay on my size 8 feet.  I will be returning these less and probably won't purchase anything else from this product line.
1.0,Started to fall apart after first wash.
1.0,Edges are very sharp and kept cutting my wrist. The lock only works every so often.
1.0,"Pretty, but made cheaply and doesn't last at all. I am so gentle on my bags and the handles fell apart within a month."
1.0,Definitely not close to the pictures
1.0,First use on olympic bar one collar had the black tab on the release break off.<br /><br />Updated: found a chunk of red plastic on floor now.  It came from the other collar.  Returning tomorrow.
1.0,These earrings are cardboard with a picture.  No even cut around the branches!!  No worth the price....
1.0,"After wearing just a few times, these shorts split right down the leg in front.  Very cheaply made, do not buy."
1.0,Awful.  Too small.  Shrunk so much after first wash even on delicate cycle!!!
1.0,The fitting description is not as accurate as I hoped.
1.0,"It is very tinny and will not hold anything for child. I bought for my 4 year old son as a gift. After I opened the box, I was afraid to even try on him. It is very delicate for a child. I had to buy a longer and stronger chain and size it for him. Figen A."
1.0,I'm extremly disappointed because the entire green bling section fell out of one of my clovers.
1.0,The pin bent the first time I tried to use it.
1.0,"Hat did NOT reflect the quality of material which I believe to be represented by the advertising on Amazon.<br /><br />I was Very unhappy with the hat and couldn‚Äôt believe that JEEP would want its logo brand on this crappy of a hat. And even if I returned the cap, the freight to ship it back would be more money than it‚Äôs worth.<br /><br />Do NOT waste your money here."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:701131add32d5e7a7d58af2989837b4e]] Quiero mi dinero esa pulsera en nada se parecen y el color pa cuando
1.0,So this shirt is more for a man.  There‚Äôs no real chest room.  The material is like a super cheap weird material that has 0 stretch and shifts all over the place.
1.0,"Waste of money.  I do not know what the other reviewers did, but it did not work on my watch.  But I have never been a big fan of adjustable wrenches.  I would always have to get the right size.  In this instance, I would need a wrench that fit perfectly on top of the watch and you can turn it.  The points kept slipping and then the adjustable part slipped and you just get stressed.  Go to a jeweler and it will save you the aggravation."
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy. I was only able to wear twice before they fell apart. Very disappointed. Because they were beautiful.
1.0,The hoop was way too big size wise not gauge wise :/ would be better for someone with a bigger nose
1.0,Lace on shoulders ripped off way too easily. Only worn once due to this.
1.0,This dress is 100% see through! Not at all like pictured.
1.0,I ordered these after reading several comments. I wear a size 6 in pants and typically pick a small in leggings. These leggings are too loose around the waist and were constantly sliding down throughout the day. Because they wouldn't stay up the seams fell in the wrong spots creating odd lines underneath my dress. I wouldn't purchase these again.
1.0,It could be that I received the wrong item! It is not worth the time and effort to replace but will not buy again. Very very disappointed.
1.0,The button on the dress came broken and it came the day before my school awards and I am very disappointed with this dress
1.0,"Bought these for my wife for running.  She liked the fit and coverage, but despite the relatively thick frames and lenses, the frames fractured around the lens in only a few weeks.  I should mention that we have both used Ironman glasses over the years, primarily because the lenses are a little thicker which offer more impact protection.  But every pair has died prematurely because some aspect of the frame breaks.  We are currently using  ""no name"" sunglasses that we bought from a kiosk at our local military exchange store (2 for $20) that work great and still look new after 6 months use.  Cannot recommend Foster Grant Ironman any more."
1.0,Fit very loose
1.0,I think this might be Asian size I usually buy from Shien but this large I got felt like a small-medium and I wear a size medium most of time... this is crazy ..
1.0,"So bummed. I LOVED this romper, was the cutest one i have and it fit great. Brought it to Europe and i literally wore it ONE day and all the seams started splitting and one even completely tore! If i got a larger size it would be way too big and it didnt feel tight at all"
1.0,"The zipper on this is so poorly made, the dress fit perfectly but the zipper burst open. I brought it with me on vacation for a special occasion and then couldn't wear it. Very disappointed."
1.0,I'm giving it one star because I had to return product because it was a bit small but I did order it in the next size up.
1.0,Don't buy it. Not what you think.  Not enough leverage with the nails to dig or do anything as advertized
1.0,After only 3 weeks my Mare Azzuro reading glasses just broke off inside temple piece. I was very careful with these too! Paying for a Amazon label and a print charge not even worth what I would get back in the end.
1.0,"The item was not as pictured, the color was much lighter in person, the material is very thin and will probably become completely see through when wet, you can see the stitching and seams so it appears to be handmade, Also I ordered a size up because of the reviews saying it ran small and it ended up being to big, I'm 5&#34;11 140lbs lean athletic build, the small probably would of fit perfect, but I still would of ended up returning it due to the overall quality of this piece"
1.0,Fabric pills/ sheds.  Otherwise it would be a nice casual top.
1.0,"I ordered 12/14 and loved them, then I sent for 4 more just like I did with previous order and they sent me 16/18 way to big....now they are disputing with me saying it is my fault and they want me to pay postage to the UK....I wore one and before the day was over it was coming apart....The shrugs are not made well...they come apart at the seams. Well the old saying is...&#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; I have learned my lesson."
1.0,"This dress is cute and fits correctly but the material feels like pajamas.  After the first wash, the tutu started ripping"
1.0,"Absolutely massive, fits like a dress. Looks nothing like the photo - ordered a small and fits like a 2xl. Returned."
1.0,"Ordered one size, got a smaller one. Since this is non returnable, I effectively lost my money.<br /><br />This is not the first time, according to the other reviews. So, future buyer, beware."
1.0,"I was disappointed when I got it, it looks really cheap for the price I paid. It also looks very feminine so I'm not sure about giving it to the person it was intended for."
1.0,"This top is so ridiculously padded as to be hideous.  Even when I removed the pads, it fit like something you'd see in a 50s pin-up photo.  Very much dislike."
1.0,Body proportions were off and felt uncomfortable.
1.0,"I ordered the purple mask and the lights are like and LED color, just a super bright white... Also, while trying it on for the first time, the mask shocked the heck out of my face! There was a live wire just left inside,  BE CAREFUL!"
1.0,Cute but very quickly the color started to wear off.  Must be spray painted.  I have a black one too.  That is starting to wear.  Too bad because they are nice otherwise.
1.0,"Bought these for my son, he had a number of costume parties, Halloween and other parties coming up and I thought they would be fun for him. He wore them once, one shoe stopped working after 2 hours, randomly it would come back on and off (very infrequent.)  The other lasted almost 6 hours.  Also noticed one of the charging ports/buttons was sticking up higher than the other, almost out of the shoe and it couldn't be pushed back into the cloth."
1.0,This tag detached from my suitcase the first time I used it for airplane travel. Could have been a fluke.
1.0,"This band made me break out into a rash! It took forever to clear up, it took about 3 very itchy weeks for the rash to finally go away."
1.0,"This was horrible, I got it in the mail for my fiance for Valentine's Day. It was completely broken, it looked like someone tried to glue the part that holds the watches back on to it. There was also broken screws. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL."
1.0,Way to big - do not stay on keep sliding off
1.0,"Horrible fit, run very small, and I order two size up, but jean quality wasn't bad!"
1.0,"Put these laces in my boots, and they broke after one wear. I tied the broken lace together, so I could wear my shoe. On the next wear, the same lace broke again in a different place. They are completely useable now after only 2 wears. :("
1.0,"I initially really liked this umbrella...seemed good quality, and the lights were pretty at night. There were no instructions included, but attached the solar panel to the top of the umbrella was very easy....just make sure you don't leave it in the box and almost throw it away (I almost did). The solar panel is at the very bottom of the box, wedged between two pieces of styrofoam, so it easily looks like it's just packaging trash. Anyway, the umbrella LED lights worked for a total of 3 days, and then stopped working. I tried taking the umbrella down and reattaching the solar panel, but nothing worked to make the lights come back on. I tried flipping the off & on switch several times too. Super bummed that this item was defective. Even more bummed that they make you pay for the shipping to send it back. Definitely won't buy from this company again."
1.0,"Really cute, unfortunately the frame broke after just 1 month of use."
1.0,Can‚Äôt fit anything in here but lipstick
1.0,"Turns for about 2 minutes and shuts off. Absolutely trash. Followed the instructions, let it charge for 8 hours before us, made sure my watch was in correctly, went to run some errands figured I'd see how it went. Came not moving, started it again and watched it, made maybe 10 revolutions, and stopped."
1.0,Too big dont want a second order. Want my money back.
1.0,Ordered bigger than I wear and it was way small.
1.0,Looked really awkward. I had to send it back.
1.0,"Waste of money. I usually wear an XL and purchased a 2XL.  A 2XL would barely fit a child. Total misleading description and  a rip off.<br />Don't waste your money, buy AMERICAN."
1.0,"Don't buy poor product, no redress from seller"
1.0,Seam opened and separated after the second wear.  Not happy.
1.0,It‚Äôs a no for me. It‚Äôs so small it‚Äôs for a toddler
1.0,It‚Äôs very small..  in the picture looks very big when it‚Äôs not.. and it‚Äôs very fragile
1.0,They might work for a 10 year old kid. But too small for an adult.  Also they came with dangerous wires sticking out of them.  I returned next day.
1.0,Thin metal. Hanger was somewhat open causing it to fall off chain. Some of open spaces were filled in with plating. It was a nice size and for the larger snaps as advertised.
1.0,No ball ends as specified in the description.
1.0,"It was way too small, the material was very cheap. Returned it for a refund."
1.0,This is not at all like the picture. You can‚Äôt even see my knees and parts of it are half way down to my ankle. I ordered a medium and it is way to big. You can‚Äôt even see my hands. Returning it.
1.0,The strap broke on the first use! It wasn't even packed that heavily.
1.0,So I usually wear medium that is why i got a medium sized dress ..<br />I have a big bust so was really tight on the chest ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è<br />The dress as well as material is really pretty and nice ..
1.0,I ordered a 2x and it was still a medium in American size
1.0,Lost after a less than a week because the clasp came undone.
1.0,"""fit shoes for 6-11.5,One size fits most men.""  Yet the product was listed under ""Big and Tall"".  This is wasting everyone's time."
1.0,Used for two trips and the plastic tab for holding the adjustments broke off of two of them.  Bought two and it happened to both so I wasn‚Äôt just that I got a bad one.
1.0,DO NOT BUY! I had this dress on for not even an hour and it ripped in two places! I had to leave a party to buy a new outfit. So embarrassing! The material is so thin and stitching is so poor it just comes apart from sitting around.  Totally disappointed by this brand and amazon!  I hope at least they will give me the courtesy of a full refund and consider changing their material before other buyers have the same issue!<br /><br />*** Amazon customer service has been amazing! I appreciate their commitment to customer service.
1.0,More of a Mrs clause costume.. I gave it to goodwill
1.0,I got this set of bracelets for my teenage daughter and it's junk. The beads are cheap looking and the first one she tried to put on popped and beads flew everywhere.
1.0,"Description states 95% cotton, 5% spandex. It is more like 40% cotton, 60% spandex. Would not sleep in spandex. Please update your product description."
1.0,Post too short Size incorrect
1.0,"I have a small watch collection and knew this watch would be a perfect addition, however, it turned out to be junk, not holding the time at all.<br /><br />1. The watch arrived in a nice box with the watch, a bracelet, 2 adjusting tools, and the instruction booklet. I did note that the box was taped, which I didn't find appealing and was a heads up, but everything inside appeared top notch and in perfect order.<br />2. The bracelet was a bonus, but did not appeal to me: not my taste. But still looked nice enough.<br />3. There are 2 tools included which is a nice thing incase one is lost or broken.<br />4. The watch was wrapped as many are, in plastic on the bands and so forth. It appeared brand new. However, there was nothing stopping the watch from running. I usually get watches with a little device under the adjustment stopper that you remove in order to 'start them.' There was none and it was running. That said, a watch running should last a few years...<br />NOTE: I love the look and feel of this watch! It looks great and it's a nice weight (heavier) that I really love.<br />5. My wife has the better eyes and dexterity for setting watches, so she took that on as she always does. She said it was average for adjusting the band sizing: some have been easier, some harder, she'd put this in the middle. Once adjusted it sat well on my wrist. I was considering going down one more, but tried it at this size for 24 hours.<br />6. But there ended up being no use for adjusting: the watch DOES NOT WORK.<br />My wife set it when she gave it to me. Within an hour I'd noticed it was off it's time. We thought in her adjusting she might have reset it, so she set if for me again. By bedtime when I took it off, it was already 1.25 hours off. I reset it to match another watch I have, and laid them next to each other (10pm). The next morning I checked them (10am) and this watch was again slow by over 2 hours. It does NOT HOLD THE TIME.<br />7. Additionally, while it looks great, she was unable to figure out how to set the month and year. It read Feb 2024 and she was never able to get anything to change that. It's so tiny I couldn't see, but it's the point of the matter.<br /><br />In the end, while I loved the look and feel what is the point of a watch that doesn't work? Maybe it's a one off. But 1. Why was it running, 2. if it was running, it should still have a few years use to it, 3. why was the box taped, 4. if it's already broken and not holding time, why? In the end I cannot recommend. So disappointed, but..."
1.0,"Felt very cheap, way too big for an 8.5 and had a weird fit. I would not recommend these shoes"
1.0,Strap broke after a month of use. :(
1.0,"Do not waste your time or money on this item. I am 5'8 and slim and the suit is cut for very small bodies. I would estimate that if you are not super petite in height, butt size and chest, do not order this suit. Construction and materials are uncomfortable. The spandex is rough to the touch and the elastic is itchy to the skin and sticks out of the seaming. The photos are misleading for this product and the reviews seem false. I am extremely disappointed and will be returning this item."
1.0,Item smelled really bad!
1.0,The picture and description were misleading. I waited almost a month for this to come was very disappointed. It was definitely nothing like what was ordered. I will be returning.
1.0,The color is not the same as in the picture it is time lite
1.0,This broke within first couple of weeks.
1.0,Constantly deflates and never stays filled with air
1.0,"I am very small boned, and therefore have very small wrists.  Nonetheless, this bracelet is way too small for me.  It might be good for a child, but that's about it."
1.0,Very low quality.  Item is not red as described but more of a dark pink.
1.0,The frame was so thin and came in bent<br /> Was a compete waste of money.
1.0,Fits like spandex not cloth material
1.0,"It was too small for an adult head, fogged up when you breath"
1.0,"It's been 30 days since I ordered this item, and it never arrived.  Not much else to say at this point... I'll amend this if it ever shows up."
1.0,"Really cheap material, fabric smells like cheap plastic. Its look like old grandma style."
1.0,"Size large is really a small. Cannot even get my3 fingers to fit the cuff, sad....."
1.0,"Way too small, did not fit one bit. I ordered an XL and got what felt like probably a medium. Cheap material as well, very thin low quality. Which I assume is why it cost so little. Probably should have returned but it would have been too much of a hassle."
1.0,Looks like lingerie when you put it on!
1.0,The socks were very nice however we only received 3 pairs of socks when we ordered 4. Each package was supposed to have 2 pairs.  This was used for a group Halloween costume (4girls) which we didn't get to use because of the quantity. We were disappointed.
1.0,Turned green after 2 days
1.0,"This watch was fantastic until the first battery change. Then it went completely south. The second hand came loose and , being $15, I sure as hell aren't going to take it anywhere to get it repaired. Seeing I am equipped to disassembled micro-circuitry, I gave it a shot. The device looks great on the outside but a cheap POS on the inside.<br />I suggest that when the batteries (one for the analog side and one fore the digital side) die, just chuck the whole thing in the trash and by a Timex or Seiko."
1.0,One of the rhinestones were missing from a few pair. Unsatisfied with the product
1.0,To small nothing like the picture
1.0,Received a  white version of this but purchased a yellow pair with different lenses.
1.0,"Outer bag was delivered ripped, as such I‚Äôm not able to reseal the main bag. Also put into question the quality and security of the masks."
1.0,"This shirt is sized for children. I am always a size small in shirts and this shirt fit like a crop top. Tiny tiny tiny. If you're going to risk ordering it, get 2 sizes larger than usual I guess...very cute shirt but sizing is completely inaccurate"
1.0,Color faded after using couple of time. Do not buy it.
1.0,"I loved this band when I first got it.  Unfortunately I wore it about 3 times and it began turning my wrist GREEN!  It never got wet, it was not hot sweaty weather, so no excuses.  It now sits in a drawer.  I am very disappointed in this product."
1.0,"Per the description I was expecting silicone bands, but these appear to be some kind of TPU/TPE material. They are more rigid than silicone and will stain. So I returned them."
1.0,The mask looks very good but the visibility is abysmal.  I would be afraid to walk around in it.
1.0,It Chahiro and Haku. Sen was Chahiro. She was given the name Sen while working for Ubaba in the bath house.
1.0,"Not pleased. Received the wrong watch so I have returned it. It was black and white, not blue in any way."
1.0,Sleeves were way too short and the size runs really small. Was hyped about this until I tried it on.
1.0,"I got this for my wife and bought the size based on other reviewers, but when she tried it on it was about 8&#34; to long and at least 6&#34; to big around."
1.0,"Ruined my date last night!  I ordered a 3x and I had a date with this cop last night I got all ready and the last thing was the dress omg it was a 2x!  Normally depending on the material I can make it work even the material is GARB it's that hot non breathable fabic with very little stretch and not flattering for bellies that's why nobody posted a pic even tho they say it's cute...  It's not, I'm so upset I was so throwed off buly it not fitting it took me 30 min to find an alternative and he was already here the 3x orders are not being filled correctly"
1.0,Horrible quality. Ripped in the shoulder seam when simply trying it on??!! Very cheap/ poor quality. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with purchase.
1.0,"Pearl is strung on clear plastic. It was also too small for my neck, but to be fair I am a large person."
1.0,The product was cheaply made.
1.0,Saw this dress and fell in love... but then I got it and first of all it's TINY! The 2 XL turned out to be like a small size in regular size! The material is SEE THROUGH!!! I was crushed when I saw this!
1.0,Arrived broken! So cheaply made
1.0,So many items on Amazon are oversized . Small fits like a medium
1.0,"Horrible quality, and illegal. You are selling copyright material. THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL THRASHER HAT! It‚Äôs just a cheap iron on patch on top of a cheap snapback. Real Thrasher hats have a strapback, a thrasher logo on the inside of the hat, and is also a completely different material. REFUND MY MONEY."
1.0,These earrings are not as they look in the picture they're real big they look like a clown would wear them they were terrible
1.0,Bracelets broke within a week
1.0,It is polyester and looks like a box. I want to return it. This top was a return
1.0,"The was only one adult mask and the rest were for a very small child.  I was very upset and frustrated,  I had place an order and a better deal popped up.  Since it was PRIME Day I think it was the deal.  I will limit my ordering here on out!  I am sorry to say that I think Amazon is getting so large that it is unable to manage and check on all of its vendors.  The picture was not showing kids in masks."
1.0,Mala calidad no se ve como en la foto
1.0,Description never indicated a no return item.<br />Dissapointed.
1.0,Runs very short. Not long at all.
1.0,"I wanted a pair of silver delicate earrings that I could wear with everything. I was thrilled to find these earrings at a low price. Unfortunately, I got what I paid for, which wasn‚Äôt much.<br /><br />The design looks better in the photo than it does in person. They are so small the details can‚Äôt clearly be seen in real life. The three little balls at the top of the earring look very cheap.<br /><br />The hooks was really designed for a child‚Äôs ear. And strangely, I can‚Äôt even get them into my ears. I have no clue what that‚Äôs about other than they are curved at the bottom. When I couldn‚Äôt get them in my ear, I tried other pairs of earrings I own, both post and hook. That‚Äôs when I realized most of the earrings I wear, while French hook earrings, don‚Äôt have a curve at the bottom where are you insert the earring. They‚Äôre straight. So there‚Äôs that issue as well. Fortunately, I make jewelry for fun so I will be able to switch out the hooks.<br /><br />Lastly, I don‚Äôt believe this is sterling silver as advertised. I held these earrings up to a real sterling .925 sterling silver necklace and pair of earrings, and these earrings have a different coloration.<br /><br />The only reason I‚Äôm not sending these earrings back is that I don‚Äôt want to get out due to COVID-19 to do a return on these. If these were normal times, I would definitely return these earrings."
1.0,These are cute shoes but my granddaughter could not even get them half-way on.<br />Her feet are not wide---not at all.<br />We sometimes have difficulty finding shoes for her that are narrow enough.<br />I was very disappointed with these shoes.
1.0,Not the color I ordered and I ordered an extra large came in and was not even a large. Fits my 6 year old.
1.0,Arrived with the posts coming unglued. Posts were just hot glued on it seems.
1.0,This has is 2/3 the size of normal cycling caps. Refer to photo.
1.0,In ordered a medium (regular size is a small in just about every brand but was looking for something slightly bigger)  and these were way too tight. My suggestion is that if you have curves and or a butt either buy a much bigger size or a completely different brand. Love the color but that‚Äôs about it.
1.0,Very cheap material and jewels were off. Too large. Foreign sizing so we got two pairs and my kids couldn‚Äôt tell which was which we sent them back after trying them on. Huge gaps
1.0,Fell apart pure and simple. The strap fell off within days and can't be reattached without breaking the entire device open. The pin that sets off the alarm comes out very easily and goes off randomly in your purse. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Bent in first wear.
1.0,"Horrible coat. I'll start by saying that it is a really cute coat and the material isn't all that bad; however, it's cheaply made. It's a very inconvenient coat for a toddler. It buttons but not up to the neck so a hoodie will be needed with this.<br /><br />The first time I washed this coat, the Bunny on the back fell off. The second time I washed it, 2 buttons at the bottom fell off. I'm scared to wash it again. What's next, the hood??!<br /><br />I wanted to return it but my mom likes it so much she won't let meüôÑ<br /><br />Horrible coat. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"
1.0,"Not bad quality and the fit is spot on. However, it advertises as coming with a hood but it does not. If you love wearing a raincoat that allows water to pour down your neck, this one is for you."
1.0,Total piece of junk! Got the set of two and the zippers do not work which is the whole point of buying this item so that you could close it and zip it shut for travel etc. It‚Äôs amazing Amazon lets these people sell this garbage on their website. Would cost more money to send it back then it‚Äôs worth. Save your money do not buy this garbage!
1.0,"Not even a year old and the frame cracked and the lens fells out, glasses were always in a case and were only worn on my boat and driving, very disappointed."
1.0,"It did not fit my gwm5610, bad Jaysandkays ripoff."
1.0,A little too tight in the chest area for myself. Quality also I didn‚Äôt think was the greatest.
1.0,Horrible! The pictures of this looked beautiful - if only that is what I would have received. It came broken and looked so cheap! The stones were cloudy and the gold was dark rose-ish color. Just don't waste your money.
1.0,"The waist was really high, so it wasn't flattering."
1.0,My two year old was very sad that the soles on her new boots fell right off the very first day she wore them.
1.0,Too thin to hold a pendant as was advertised.
1.0,"My four grandsons  wants  those shoes &  I buy them ,at third day  two of them broke, The warranty works very good they give me the reembolsen so fast  and  few days The others stop to work  to ,Incredible , They are so sad,  They went to rebuy  But I don't want to expect  The same  experience.  Somebody know about a better brand?"
1.0,Not happy with this product it came very small and see through the material used is very thin and over all disappointed with this product.
1.0,"Almost shred putting them on - very poor quality. But, fun paly cloths."
1.0,"If you have boobs this dress is not for you, honey. I'm used to tightness in my chest area, but this dress gave me straight up square boobs."
1.0,Waste of money. Turned awful color made my neck green eew
1.0,I heard that the necklace and chain was too small. It was given as a gift.
1.0,"Ran small. I am tall, and the top was not long enough to wear over stretch pants. Fabric was nice."
1.0,"These weren't even straight, both came crooked and looked really bad because they weren't straight. How does a paperclip or safety pin have better quality control than these earrings"
1.0,I'm so unhappy its like smaller than expected and so disappointed that it dont add cup size!!! It is very pretty tho!
1.0,Broke within minutes! Don't waste your money!
1.0,Works horrible
1.0,"I love the frame design of these sunglasses, but they are cheaply made.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  Like the other review, mine broke within a week."
1.0,Not a very attractive dress.
1.0,Ordered for my Mom and she hated it .
1.0,Description is not accurate. These are tiny for a child.  I should have read the reviews. This was a waste of my time.  I sent them back.
1.0,I wear an XL and this clearly was made for women with a small chest. Disappointed because I was looking forward to it and now I can return it
1.0,"Do not arrange these thin shots, order with a few broader shots. I am very disillusioned of this product, The Girl does not like the sleeves like that, she feels inconvinient. If they do not have the product that is ordained, they do not bandage it."
1.0,Horrible quality & runs super big.  Returned dress!
1.0,These are NOT touch screen gloves. They do not work on your phone. They‚Äôre a nice pair of gloves but they do not serve the purpose of their purchase.
1.0,"Definitely not children‚Äôs sized masks. In the images they measure 6.9 inches across, the ones I received were over 8 inches across making them useless for my kids."
1.0,Material is scratchy and not white. It‚Äôs more a dingy off white.
1.0,"I bought them to have night driving glasses, but when using them it made no difference, the light from the cars blinding me still, and the glasses gave me after 5' wearing while driving at evening/night an awful headache, I bought them for driving at night and hope to receive the right glasses please. I bought my brother as well, and his are working. Please contact me about, still awaiting your answer."
1.0,Disappointed .. not well made and very scratchy material .. also size ver small and no stretch ..
1.0,They feel like something you might get out of a cereal box.
1.0,They said the sizes were women and not the case. Returned them.
1.0,The pro was not what I expected. A sticker was on the apron and basic cheap print on hat. Left me scrambling for another gift idea.
1.0,"Very thin, too thin to call them ""sweatpants"""
1.0,uncomfortable and it does not fit well in the waist
1.0,This looks like a horrible shiny Halloween costume cross between a witch and a pilgrim. I laughed out loud taking it out of the package and tossed it in the donation bin for my kids school drama class. Looks 0% like the picture.
1.0,Cap is small and the material is very thin
1.0,"So very, very disappointed. Ordered  size up just in case, well not accurate sizing at all. Im not sure if you can see, the wider material with a zipper, which is faulty by the way, its suppose to zip upon mid to upper abdomen. Well, zipper wouldn't seat properly, so it couldn't zip. Then the smaller outside pieces velcro together over whichever weak spot on your back or abdomen you needed support for. i have weak back so i have another one of these to progress my workout. This one was exceedingly thin material. and I think instead of a XXL it fits like a medium. I strongly advice researching weight training belts so you get one that fits!"
1.0,Had to return. I really wanted to like these over-the-glasses sunglasses since I'm forever losing my clip-ons but when they say over sized sunglasses they aren't messing around. These were massive on my face and would not stay on my ears or face. I'll keep searching for something that will work because I really like the concept of these.
1.0,Cheap and thin and shapeless.
1.0,I really wanted to love this beanie set I bought two sets because I though they were cute and a great deal and I wanted my daughters and I to have matching beanies for a winter trip. Sadly the adult beanie is sized for a huge unnatural sized head. I wish I had returned them but I‚Äôve accidentally washed and dried another beanie (from a different brand) and it shrunk; so I thought I‚Äôd give it a try with these beanies to get a more natural fit but nope they didn‚Äôt shrink. {{sigh}} lesson learned cheaper doesn‚Äôt always mean a quality fit.
1.0,"Very disappointed, ear muffs could barely fit on my ear, no give an take to get on and off."
1.0,Extremely small and not worth it at all.
1.0,Pewter cracked and head came off! Save your money! I am still looking I loved the fact of hanging my keys in my pocket I am hooked on it.<br /><br />Mahalo!<br />Joe
1.0,"I always buy multiple Volitile shoes every year...they are my favorite but this pair was very disappointing as it is so wide, I dont know how it could fit anyone's foot. Something in the way this one is made. I always recommend this company but not this particular show."
1.0,I received the necklace which was packed like all amazon jewe.  Within 2 weeks the necklace tarnished from the color gold
1.0,"This jumper is made very cheaply and its not necessarily the kind that you would be able to wear a bra with. However, the top is way too thin and see through to go braless. This clothing is poorly designed and I do not recommend buying."
1.0,This bracelet caused a bad skin rash on my wrist when i wore it.
1.0,Broke in less than a week was a gift was very unsatisfactory
1.0,"I have a similar pair of Bobster glasses with yellow lenses that I love. But these ‚Äúamber‚Äù glasses had so little tint on them that they were practically clear and were worthless, at least to me, for daytime riding. Maybe they‚Äôd be okay for night riding, but I prefer yellow lenses for that. Returned and purchased a different brand that works well."
1.0,sizing is not what chart says
1.0,"Not worth it for the price. Its generally attractive but it does NOT have pockets as pictured. It does hide that fact somewhere deep in the description. It's also a very light cheap material. My sister purchased one from Amazon that is a similar style different brand which is heavier and has pockets for less than this. Also, it doesn't have a loop at the neck to hang on hooks. That might not be their fault but it's still a design flaw."
1.0,bracelet not is  silicone
1.0,"In 2018 I bought a pair of<br />Rivacci Men Women Wayfarer Black Frame / Blue Mirror Lens Classic Retro Polarized Sunglasses Sold by: Rivacci and they are no longer available. No wonder, I thought my eyes were going on me. These lenses are not focused properly with the layers of film or whatever is in between the lenses. I tried my Maui Jim polarized sunglasses I bought over 10 yrs ago and they were perfect. Not sure about the focus on the new Rivacci‚Äôs, but the pair I had was junk. I guess the saying ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù is true."
1.0,This was delivered yesterday and it is missing a gem. There were no extra gems included so I can‚Äôt fix it myself. It also has a very strong stench to it. I aired it out but the smell is still there. Very disappointed. I plan on returning it.<br />*i included a picture of the missing gem*
1.0,Very pretty but not for anything but show. Any tension and it breaks.  Wore it once and it popped as soon as my dress moved.  The other side broke from me pulling it to ‚Äòadjust‚Äô it.  Sad
1.0,Liesssss Received the wrong item. Notice the name on the purse. Notice the tan on the buckle and notice it came with NO STRAP. Amazon is not doing well this year with delivering what is shown. Shame on you.
1.0,The first time my wife wore these the heel came apart
1.0,Way to small. I'm an XL and I could fit them above my thigh
1.0,Not for long wearing. Just lasted 1 month before it turned brown.
1.0,Discolored immediately. Very upsetting.
1.0,this thing is cheap and broke just days after receiving it.
1.0,Terrible quality!<br />I liked it the first time but after a month it started to peeling off the black part.
1.0,Very bad fit and poor quality
1.0,"The large fits like a small, I normally wear a medium got the large for a looser fit and it fit like a small"
1.0,Piece of $hit broke after 2 weeks.
1.0,The item I received was used. There were no tags attached and there were pilled balls of fabric.
1.0,Cheap base metal
1.0,so cheap and horrible just threw them away
1.0,Thin and cheap.  I got what I paid for. Should have known better.
1.0,I'm petite with small bust. The Top squished the girls and looked like a tent from the girls down. Returned it.
1.0,"Lace is very thick, isn't fitted at waist, falls at mid calf! Looks like an &#34;old lady&#34; dress! Will be returning it!"
1.0,"Cheap looking , broke after 2 days"
1.0,When they arrived they were terribly tarnished.
1.0,If you want to feel like your eyes will come out buy these!
1.0,I was disappointed by these. The way the description reads they are a compression tank. But they were not at all. Very loose for a small and not sure what was up with the color but they were supposed to be white but they looked like they had been washed with colors. Very dingy looking. Returned them.
1.0,All I can say is cheap cheap cheap!
1.0,Not as described and was way to small. I looked at the sizing chart and considering the model is 5'10&#34;and  takes a small I figured I should get a medium. I am shorter but thought if anything it will be big. well I was wrong looks like I should have ordered an xxl. the top came up to right under my breasts and the bathing suit did not have the three buttons on each side as pictured. Not happy
1.0,I liked the design that's why i ordered one piece. Fitting is horrible.
1.0,Very difficult to figure out waste of money
1.0,"The material is ok but it's not the same as describe, the split supposed to be until above knee but I got below my knee. Its between my knee and my ankle the split."
1.0,These are so pretty and I purchased them because of them having a screw back. I gave them to my daughter for her birthday Saturday and today is Monday and one side is missing. Such a disappointment.
1.0,"I bought these for my wedding, it's more of a coral than a peach and I couldn't return :("
1.0,"After a single wearing and subsequent one gentle wash/dry, several of the silvery embellishments disappeared from the shirt. Terribly disappointed. Usually quite satisfied with Alfred Dunner items. Returned and credited."
1.0,Ordered XL for husband. It was very short in length  and slim fitting more like a woman‚Äôs shirt.
1.0,Very stiff. Came with 2 chargers instead of a remote and charger
1.0,The proportions are off! It does not fit well and the material is terrible.
1.0,"very disappointed, very small and very very thin, will not keep little fingers warm, not worth almost 10$"
1.0,This is like a maternity dress. it is HUGE.
1.0,"This is just a miss. It runs far too small (3 sizes at least), and the fabric is far too flimsy and thin. Definitely going back."
1.0,This item is not quality at all and the piece doesn't even have the capability to hold a picture so I really don't know what it is called a locket. So disappointing!!!
1.0,Did not like the feel for the rings. They are not comfortable as other silicone rings. Feels like a neoprene o-ring on your finger. The rings has a lot of pores they are not very presentable. I trashed them immediately. Do not waste your money.
1.0,Too short! More like a shirt.
1.0,"very tight, not true size"
1.0,"They worked very well when they did work, but after two days the left side stopped working, contacted the company and waiting for a response, will update!"
1.0,"Unfortunately, the Print pattern  and the front doesn‚Äôt even come close to matching.  Defective,<br />I am returning this."
1.0,Not very good quality. Mine ripped at the crotch the first 3 hours of wearing them.
1.0,"AFTER WASHING, THEY SHRINK TWO WHOLE SIZES!  HOW CAN YOU SELL SLEEPWEAR THIS BAD?"
1.0,"Gorgeous bracelet.  Crappy quality.  Feel apart after less than a month.  Buy only if you are a huge fan of arts and crafts and gluing stuff.  You can then enjoy trying to put the thing back together again.  The rope that wraps around came undone, and the vertical ropes that go into the clasp came out."
1.0,"No stars at all. Absolutely garbage, looks nothing the photo what so ever. What I got looks like a piece of gauze. Will not even waste my time and effort returning. Going in the trash..."
1.0,Poor the layer it s coming off
1.0,"Where's the belt? How am I supposed to wear it? It looks like a nightgown. Could you send the belt?<br />It‚Äôs huge it looks like a nightgown.<br />I totally disagree I am 5.4 'and I weigh 150 and I always wear M but it looks like an L, I don't wear it at all and the worst part is that he doesn't have his belt."
1.0,"This shirt sucks hot garbage. Don't buy it dudes and dudettes. It isn't worth it. It might tantalize you with promises of softness and perfect fit, but I promise you they are lies. You will be left with a material as thin as bills you spent to buy it, and as your financial downturn strangles you figuratively you will wonder why anyone would think to design a shirt that chokes you literally. Walk away folks, this shirt won't solve your problems."
1.0,The backs are for a dangle earring. They broke the first time I wore them.
1.0,"Fits small, material feels weird and it has a terrible strange odor. I returned it."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ce3633b50fc0f40822d371b7d664e783]]
1.0,"Watch strap broke after 4 days of use. Only paid $15.00, but was hoping to get more than 4 days of use."
1.0,Fit about a boy 6 around waist and maybe a 10-12 boy length. Very disappointed.
1.0,"This dress runs big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1, 110 pounds, 32D and got a small. I drowned in it. The length came down almost to my ankles but I‚Äôm used to things long on me- I would‚Äôve just hemmed up the length but the top was big and poofy."
1.0,"I bought these and initially thought they were great, but after a month of wearing and washing them, every single pair ripped where the lace is. Don‚Äôt waster your money on these!"
1.0,"I ordered 2 sets of these from different vendors.  This one was listed as medium the other large and they were identical in every way except packaging.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I'm older so the girls are tired, but I hate bras so I thought I'd give these a try.  I'm not very chesty and at most a C cup.<br /><br />On first use the stickiness was super, but if you have to reposition (and I did), you can count that as a ""use"".  The first few tries came out with a folded boob look.  After about 5 repositions the stickiness was gone and I had to wash/dry them to see if anything recovered.<br />Now we're on day 2, after yesterdays practice session it only took 2 tries and they're in a workable position.  A few things to note:<br />1.  It takes some work to make the girls look ""normal"" with these attached.<br />2.  They're thick pads and they can be seen underneath a regular T-Shirt.  If you're wearing something form-fitting they will be VERY noticeable.<br />3.  After wash/dry stickiness is still reduced. I find myself pressing them back down because I can feel them slipping and suspect they won't last all day.<br />4.  They will give you a bit of lift, but these are essentially nipple covers.  The girls look less tired, but don't fall into the perky category.<br />5.  If you're perky these may be great as nipple covers, but you can find something a LOT cheaper for that.  Otherwise, as my title says ... don't bother.<br />6.  If you still feel compelled to try these, find the cheapest ones.  IMHO they are all the same."
1.0,"Fabric thin, can see underwear through the fabric"
1.0,It was not made well at all. Could never give this as a gift.
1.0,Shirt fit ok but neck was very big.
1.0,This bracelet is adorable but not durable. The two braided bands fell off the first time I wore it. Not much without them. Bead is nice. I'm hoping it stretches and I can wear around my ankle. Good luck!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:529641af4779cc4fdbea2e7d7468dbe8]] Actually very bad not like Picture I think this is a flaw in the industry and colour not good üíî
1.0,"These left my skin black from a cheap, probably toxic dye. Poor quality from China I presume??"
1.0,So I got this outfit and it doesn't even cover my butt. I ordered a larger size than my normal and was disappointed with how small it was. it isn't as sexy in person as it is on the picture
1.0,"I've ordered Kate Spade bags on Amazon before, actually the same bag just a different year and different color. I am not impressed with this bag. The leather feels cheap and hard and the main zipper sticks. I should have returned it right away but I thought I may warm up to it, that never happened. I feel I wasted $200+ on a bag that is so so."
1.0,Cheapest thing ever. Already torn up.
1.0,"It was pretty, but it fit small and I order an extra large."
1.0,These didn't stay on during my workout. Wish I could return them.
1.0,"I bought these for my niece's flower girl outfit for my wedding and they were WAY too small for her.  I ordered the size 9 toddler, which is what she wears, and these were nowhere close to fitting her!  Very disappointed because they are adorable!"
1.0,terrible product. doesn't work unless 1 ft in range and if you start moving it doesn't work and starts disconnecting. For sure not 33ft range. It is a lie.
1.0,"False advertisement, nothing whatsoever as described. A waste of money!"
1.0,Such a crappy product. Everything came apart after 10 min. Will be returning
1.0,"I READ ALL THE POOR REVIEWS AND THOUGHT, IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.<br />MINE BROKE AS SOON AS I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PUT ON FOR THE FIRST TIME!<br />A WASTE OF MONEY!<br />Don't second guess yourself, this a waste of money."
1.0,I am very disappointed. I bought a blue/purple  one & a black/grey one for the charge 3. I used the blue one first. It worked great. I changed to the black one & my watch fell off after a few days and was lost. I would not trust this product. It sucks because it was extremely comfortable.
1.0,The left lens popped right out on my third wearing of these sunglasses. These sunglasses are cheap for a reason.
1.0,This is NOT A SWEATSHIRT. It is thin  t-shirt material. It was cute. The color is nice. The words printed on it are that plastic/rubber stuff that will eventually crack and peel off.  Definitely not worth the price. Would be fine if it was priced way less. I sent it back!
1.0,Shabbily made fits where cheap material returned it and 4 weeks later I‚Äôm still waiting on my refund from them‚Ä¶
1.0,"It's not huggie style, it's big."
1.0,The graphic was not as expected.  No rhinestones.  Very disappointing üòû.
1.0,The material of the top section and fit both are not good.  Would not recommend it.
1.0,Clip broke off the first time I used it.
1.0,Cheapest material. Similar to a cheap bandana from a dollar store. Also print was a decal. Colors were pink and blue. Don't buy this. It will be returned.
1.0,Broke less than 15 days after I got it in the mail. Super cheap. I recommend spending a little extra for something with better quality.
1.0,I can't even rate the fit because the piece is unfinished.  There is not hole for the head to go through.  I was sent a dirty raw piece of fabric for the pants.  We got a good laugh at work about it because it was so ridiculous!!
1.0,Item received looks nothing like the photo.
1.0,This is the second time I ordered this first I got the wrong thing so I ordered again and it came all broken. I will not order again so sad what a mess
1.0,"I was extremely disappointed in the color. The description says red but this is clearly pink. Also, the material is very cheap. When I tried them on, I was afraid they would rip. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
1.0,"What you receive is not the dress in the photos. Not worth $19, maybe $5 at best. I received one that was clearly second hand, even the tag was cut. The fabric is thin and cheap, the ""dress"" is shapeless. The only good thing about it was the color, but the garment is see-through so not even that. Disappointing..."
1.0,The strap broke on 10/27 after having bought it on Aug 20th. Life of 3 months was absolutely not what I expected
1.0,The strap looked ALOT longer in the pictures. I was disappointed.
1.0,Broke after wearing it 2 days
1.0,My daughter wore it for one fair show and it was falling apart...all the blue was cracked and coming off.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"This product came on time. However, there was a visible stain that I am praying is not blood. We will see when I wash it. And the tag is on the outside of the shorts as seen on the photos. I mean I know it was $12 but jeeZe they could do better and not send clothes with stains and randomly placed tags."
1.0,The white jacket area is not at all white as expected. It Looks very bad as it has blackish appearance all over. Please don‚Äôt bluff the customer with the picture showing white jacket because the jacket is not at all white
1.0,I think I may have actually been able to see into a nightmare S&M universe while wearing these. It was like the bad bits of Event Horizon. I had a headache after 3 minutes of wearing and experienced anal leakage as a result.
1.0,"I somehow got two of these..on separate days..I love it! But, aren't the other one back.. on Jan 2nd 2020. I have called twice about getting the refund.. still nothing!"
1.0,"They don‚Äôt protect your hand from the cold. I used them to ride bike and my hands get really cold. The touchscreen does not work and they are bulky, which makes using your hands while wearing the gloves really hard."
1.0,"Umbrella is made of cheap plastic, and someone decided to put an AMZN barcode sticker directly on the plastic, which stretched the plastic out when trying to gently remove it. Plastic has several damaged areas. It‚Äôs like a cheap plastic tablecloth. Returned immediately."
1.0,I did not order these
1.0,Cheap material poor quality
1.0,"I see pieces hanging. Poorly made, very hot for your skin."
1.0,Shipping was terrible! Item fell apart. Not happy
1.0,I would love to purchase this - but not if I cannot choose the design I would like
1.0,"I have had this a little over a year and the metal ring on the side has already broken, so the line of the purse is ruined. I wish I could find a replacement."
1.0,Product said a box of 20 and received a single taper will not be ordering again
1.0,I ordered this item because it showed me 10 but when the delivery came it was only 3 pieces in the package so I returned them.
1.0,These do not work very well. Spend a little bit more money for actual working ones. Do not buy.
1.0,"This dress is indeed¬† worthy of a detailed if not plaintively emotional review. The reality is, if I wanted to wear a scratchy burlap sack, I could have gone to any of my local feed stores. After all, I do live in Oklahoma; and there is no lack of¬†businesses providing¬† necessary goods for farmers and ranchers.<br />I see there are very positive reviews on this garment. I feel that speaks to the indomitable human spirit and the subjectivity of empirical experience. I'm sure that nearly everyone is able to have a distinct experience with this particular dress. However, in my case, it felt like the kind of polyester that you might have seen your third grade teacher wearing in perhaps the mid-70's. And of course I just dated myself there.<br />The texture reminded me of the extremely uncomfortable-looking dresses or slacks which harken back to be restrictive and misogynistic corsets of old. The rare original edition by Nathaniel Hawthorne, that moral narrative of the life of Hester Prynne, recounts  that she was offered this dress in lieu of The Scarlet Letter to be emblazoned on her forehead; to which she curtly replied:  ""I'll take the letter thank you very much,"" while fishing a blazing A-shaped iron from the smoldering coals.<br />But this dress, right out of the bag, felt less like a garment and more like the kind of torture apparel commonly used by¬† nuns or priests in the 1600's to secretly atone for their sins and perform self penance in the privacy of their cloistered and candle-lit cells.¬†<br />Sliding it over my skin, I think it removed part of my epidermis. So really, it could be an exfoliating kind of garment; but that would require extreme rebranding. So I would say that, if one were to come home from a day in this dress, you will either need Neosporin, hydrocortisone, or a stiff drink to blot out the memory of the trauma, or perhaps an Epsom salt bath to soothe the countless micro wounds inflicted upon your skin from the duration of your wearing it.<br />It might be easy to surmise that I cannot recommend this garment, with one shameful exception: if you have the opportunity to gift it to a friend, who isn't really a friend; but who is really more of a "" frenemy."" Simply put,¬† they will thank you for it- because it's a reasonably attractive dress. But after wearing it for a day, they will know that you committed nothing less than passive aggressive dress-giving.¬† They will have no choice but to tell you that they received compliments on it; when in fact their entire body is now chafed, red, and is a testament to the kind of ""friendship"" that you and she truly share. Just be careful not to tell her where you got it, or you will surely receive the identical dress, in a different color for your next birthday, so that you guys can be¬† ""twins."" But do not be fooled.¬† It is really just a ploy for her to see you go through your day with the barely- concealed grimace of pain and stark betrayal on your face.<br />I would dub this be, ""lets you really know where you stand with people,"" dress because if you wear it and you purposely brush up against a co-worker and they don't yelp in pain,¬† then you're in a unique position to know that- either they truly value you, or that they are an extremely duplicitous person who does not have your back. This is a person you should avoid at the water cooler and shy away from all invitations to enjoy salads at lunch, for this person will never tell you when you have spinach in your teeth or a knife in your back.<br />However, if somebody thoughtfully feels the dress and then tells you that they may now have to wear gloves to work, then I think this is someone with whom you can cultivate a deeper friendship. And in this way, this dress serves as a kind a social litmus test.¬† I think this could be very beneficial in the workplace, assuming that you have the fortitude to last the entire day in this torturous nightmare. Remember, in the immortal words of Frederick Nietzsche,¬† ""when you look at the dress,¬† it looks back at you.""<br />In conclusion, as a personal test of endurance and dissociation, or as a an instrument of speakable and divisive social detection vehicle, or as a means to gauge the true fortitude of your spirit in the face of unmitigated evil, I can recommend this dress. You may want to pair it with a yoke, or perhaps the stocks from an ancient public shaming area or even the kind of prong collar which has been abandoned by even the most fastidious of dog trainers, due to its inhumane means of control.<br />After a period of reflection in what I consider a far lesser instrument of corporeal testing, I meditated in the Iron Maiden in the corner of my room, because I find it far less constrictive and trendy- I feel I have undersold the stress and that there is another highly lucrative venue in which it  will surpass all expectations.<br />The movie franchise of ""Saw"" is one which has endured many perplexing years and quite literally, every deviant conception of ways to test and torture people in the face of extreme duress surely of which one can conceive. One wonders how can be possible that screenwriters manage to manifest new and unspeakable terrors, pitting humanity against survival in a primal test to withstand these massications and regain not only once freedom but life itself. This is where this dress can truly shine; and I don't mean the sheen due to its potential radioactivity, as¬†even the hellish brimstone dust that probably has left a kind of Dante-inspired 9th Circle patina on the garment, a telltale hallmark of the diabolical sweatshop in which it was surely forged.<br />I personally would gladly pay the full ticket price to see that weird little Muppet guy with the white mask ride out on his little tricycle with this monstrosity draped over the handlebars. It reminds one of William Blake's poem which is the counterpart to ""Tyger"", ""The Lamb,"" in which he proposes that eternal  cosmological query:¬† ""Who made you dress? Dost thou know who made thee?""<br />We know and contrast that this dress is certainly not of the lamb but of the Beast, that rough Beast, with its ""slow-moving thighs, slouching towards towards Bethlehem to be born.""<br />The vivid imagery of this poem is palpable; but Blake would be posthumously gratified to learn that we now know why the Beast slouches; and we understand the source of the constriction and rash that his slow-moving thighs must elicit is because of the imprisoned by the unnecessarily cruel ruffle that crosses from the waist to the shoulder; and his thighs will be forever a testament to the universal potential for evil ¬† symbolized by chafed thighs.  Whether one is taking a quick jaunt to the local coffee shop or to that ancient city in an attempt to thwart the eventual Gospels or ""Good News"" which will soon follow, this is the dress to undermine all stories of trial and redemption.  One might wonder if the Beast is trying to keep pace the three wise men who are probably dressed far more sensibly in robes which are both flowing and flattering for all body shapes and sizes. My money is on the Magi; because in this case, fashion and functionality play no part in the epic struggle to lay claim to the enduring nature of the human spirit; and if not learn from it, at least experience it as a morality play if you will, such as Faust.<br />Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  had this dress in,  I believe, the wine color. He wore this dress, much to the chagrin of the contemporaries, the writers and philosophers of his day, who all, in one dismissive gesture turned their backs on his wine-clad figure and said in unison with unbridled disdain: ""I don't know her."" It was from this crucible that the alchemical powers of the dress were truly realized. Therefore, I think that the dress is an instrument, not only of a nondescript shop in China (and may I say parenthetically- thank goodness I received it before the Trumpian tariffs really kicked in; because had I not been moved to purchase it when I did, it surely would have been marked up to a prohibitive $12.99 instead of the humble $9.00 that I paid). But we give unto Caesar what is Caesar's and while this caftan might suit Caesar, as it is somewhat reminiscent of a toga silhouette, he would have undoubtedly thrown himself down the Senate steps before he could have even¬† suffered that historic betrayal by those he trusted and considered both friends and supporters of his meteoric destiny. As Ovid and Herodotus both recounted for posterity that¬† ""Thrice he tried the dress on and Thrice he refused it.""<br />In summation, it really comes down to your intention. Do you wish to strive in certain futility like Sisyphus, ever rolling that rock up the hill- or adjusting his Spanx as a contemporary allegory, or do you seek to lash yourself to the mast so that the shrill tide of the Siren's song of ridicule  and  barely-restrained laughter in the wake of this dress conveying you into the depths, to be seen again.¬† Only you can answer this question.  Only you can pay $9.00 and wait like the divine Siddartha under the Bodhi tree while you wait the three to six weeks it takes in order to complete the gauntlet that this dress provides.<br />God bless.  Be strong, and for God's sake keep the receipt."
1.0,The shirt was very pretty but it was extremely small.  I normally wear a large but I ordered an extra large and I couldn't get it on.  It was more like a small.
1.0,Poor quality.  Big on top and way too short to be a dress.
1.0,"Clasp broken. When I tried to secure it back on, I realized that the clasp does not open and close. This company should send me a new one for my time and effort and money."
1.0,These shoes are very cute but the quality sucks for the price. They are already wearing holes in the sole insert after one month of use. Very flimsy. Don't waste your money!
1.0,The TV add indicated that it was easy to put these compression socks and easy to take them off.  This is simply not true. It is very hard to put them and very hard to take them off.
1.0,It's torn
1.0,I want me money back because this product put my car seat and my clothes dirty with the mall things came out from the jacket
1.0,"Just recieved, opened it and immediately knew it is not sterling silver and of course there is no marking whatsoever. Will be returning immediately"
1.0,"The material feels like a soft-ish version of burlap, oversized and doesn't seem proportionate even it it did fit. I don't think I've ever described a dress as awkward, but it's awkward. I'm most annoyed that I'm being charged $3.99 to mail it back; USPS is the only option. It takes a lot of me to be motivated to return something, but in all the times I've returned an Amazon purchase, I've never been charged."
1.0,What the hell?! It‚Äôs just a sheet of cloth. I want My $$ back and I‚Äôll mail it back to you.
1.0,"I love the look of this shirt but beware, it stains easily. I put lotion on and shortly after put this shirt on and it‚Äôs been ruined ever since. I washed it a ton of times and tried soaking in stain remover- I had to throw away. I think this happened the 1st time I wore it too. What a waste !"
1.0,This coat is not accurate in size whatsoever. I had to send it back.
1.0,This looked nothing like the photo! Returned and very disappointed.
1.0,"too big, cheap quality"
1.0,"It's pretty, but was too wide in shoulders and fabric too thin."
1.0,the paint comes off them they are not just colored metal! and some of them the balls would never screw off!
1.0,It was the right size but the compression material was not strong enough for the compression I was needing to hold in a c section incisional hernia. It wouldn't have been strong enough post section pre hernia to prevent a hernia either.
1.0,"These are not as depicted, there are no arch supports, no arch or inner sole whatsoever. Complete disappointment."
1.0,The material is to thin
1.0,I'm a size 9/10. It broke an hour into wearing it.  Very cheap metal.
1.0,"I was so absolutely excited about these earrings! I feel in love with the large multi colored acrylic! They are super cute chunky earrings that can go with virtually any outfit! BUT one of the piercings has already came out of the acrylic piece after only two weeks. I‚Äôm sure it can be reglued, however I am disappointed I only got to wear them once before something went wrong. And I lost the small earring piece because it was so small after breaking off the acrylic part."
1.0,"1"" short"
1.0,Threads were coming loose before I even tried it on. Poor quality - not even worth the price.
1.0,it looks beautiful in the picture  but now that I got it it looks chip and old the metal part it looks tarnished
1.0,"Wasn‚Äôt sure it the dress would fit so I ordered because of the ADVERTISED FREE RETURNS.  The dress was pretty but didn‚Äôt fit right so I requested a refund.  Well the seller didn‚Äôt offer a postage paid label, so I had to pay $17 for return shipping. I received a $21.24 refund  with the following explanation:<br />Item Refund: $79.99<br />Item Tax Refund: $6.20<br />Item Promotion Deduction*: ($4.80)<br />Restocking Fee Refund Deduction: ($60.15)<br />I spent money and have nothing to show for it!"
1.0,Who the heck is actually wearing this material?! What total garbage.
1.0,This set turned green within a week I‚Äôm not sure why they advertise it as stainless steel or surgical steel that is not supposed to tarnish won‚Äôt purchase again
1.0,Took it out the package and it fell apart in my hand. Waste of time!
1.0,I like the STYLE of this sweater but it is larger than expected and isn't very flattering. It is large around the waist/bottom so it hangs away from your body and looks too big. also the sleeves are too short so when you lift your arms they are literally at your elbows. I had to roll them up to make it look decent and I'm hoping it will shrink in the wash. Also I am 5'6 145 pounds and 34dd and I ordered a SMALL
1.0,UPDATE- so the pads I wear for my period don't stick to the material of the panty so they're useless... Waste of money...
1.0,"Cheaply made.. packaging was great, but was disappointed to pull out a pair of completely plastic sunglasses. They‚Äôre flimsy and are not quality."
1.0,"the tuxedo stamped in the shirt its not aligned with the center of the neck. it is moved to the right like an outlet. I can accept it for 5 dollars... but for the price I paid, I wanted a regular one. I do not recommend it."
1.0,They were too thin and fragile.
1.0,"Thought these would be great, but within 20 minutes of wearing they start to sag and grow in not so good places. Not for any type of workout."
1.0,"I read a review saying the shoe runs a little big so order one size smaller than normal so I did and it fit perfect. The boot lasted 6mths then the heel came loose, the fit so good I just ordered another pair in a different color"
1.0,The decal was ironed on with a crease in the hat. I won't wear
1.0,Very cheap would send back but not worth the effort
1.0,"These run very small I order a extra large, I usually take a large.I didn‚Äôt like the fit or material and they are very short"
1.0,Watch strap does not stay connected. The small arm that goes through the holes in the strap just comes right out because it is too short. $1500 watch falls right off.<br />Bought the strap before the watch came and now it‚Äôs too late to return this worthless strap.
1.0,Way way too small it‚Äôs from China so that‚Äôs all you need to know. I ordered a Large and it would fit a very short 6th grader . I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 so if you are 5'4 or under it might fit you also was very tight.
1.0,"Unfortunately, they were not only too big but the platform gave them about a 6 inch height!  I didn't check the return policy and &#34;ye gads&#34;  it cost me $15 to return them!  Won't make that mistake again."
1.0,Three nose rings did not have balls on the end to keep them from falling out of your nose a grate disappointment
1.0,this is sooo small that even i don't know what it is unless i bring it right up to my nose. never thought it would be that small
1.0,Crotch way too long and pants too short.  I don't know how these fit anyone.  They're also really stiff.
1.0,smaller and shorter than expected.
1.0,Colors so brown and no turquoise or bright colors as shown. So disappointed.
1.0,"its totally the opposite os the picture, is not hight wast as show at the picture, the legs are not skinny as the picture, and this size 13 seems bigger then other pants, cause my pants are 13 and they fit perfect"
1.0,These are massive an very stiff. Do not fit the face we‚Äôll at all
1.0,Just received these and there are lines on each pearl where the top and bottom of each pearl was joined together. I can even see the lines without my glasses so they are going back.
1.0,"Very sweet little stickers with a character my child loves however after putting them on her ears one fell off right away. The other wouldn't re stick after removing them. I'd probably just look for these at the dollar store for that reason, no better quality.<br /><br />Edited to add, they stick to nothing."
1.0,"SUPER UNFLATTERING.  If you have any stomach/hip chub at all, this skirt will not flatter you - the pleats hit just below your stomach and accent whatever pooch you may have.  If you have an absolutely flat stomach, you might be ok but I‚Äôm not sure.  The undershirts are also VERY short."
1.0,I really liked these out of the package. I wear them for water  volleyball in a salt water pool. Less than 1 month old the mirror finish is dissappearing causing spotted vision. So happy I'm within return period.  They are going back!
1.0,The picture presented is very misleading. THe actual mask cannot even hold its shape and it is full of chalky powder with an powerfully uncomfortable smell. Also you cant really see much out of it making it impractical if you want to walk around in it. Definitely not worth the price I paid.
1.0,The picture the seller has is not what was sent. My daughter put on a ring and it fell apart. Great price but horrible product.
1.0,I love the colors and the width but the buckle is too big if you have to take the belt off for whatever reason especially at the airport it‚Äôs pain in the butt to do so
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e97e9c851a6e839a2ba651feddffb1c2]] Not even worth a star its a rip off don't waste your money nothing like the picture I really upset and want my money back very cheap the post were bent and it could break
1.0,I like nothing. size is not true
1.0,The blazer was way too small for me.  I was so upset I didn't want to exchange it.
1.0,It came broken in the packaging. Very dark unappealing color. Was not detailed carefully. Very cheap material.
1.0,"This is a cute dress I bought for my daughter, and she loved it, but before she got to wear it we washed it and there was a hole in the back. I purchased the small red and blue plaid."
1.0,Wrong size and it was ripped on one side I will return and credit account
1.0,Costume was junk and the straps were already broke off I had to safety pin it and it was a lot bigger than I hoped. Super cheaply made and do not recommend.
1.0,"I loved this visor among all other visors for the broader head band, wider peak and nice details like the tab with the logo on the end of the strap. A quality product. Alas the sweat stain from a Florida summer started to make it look ratty after a year or so, so I ordered another from Amazon. I cut all the tabs off and tried it on. Different fit, smaller, narrower, no tab, and missing the fit and size for which I bought it. Disappointed."
1.0,Don't waste your time or money on this thin piece of garbage. At the most it should cost $1 to $2. It came in a big box with bubble plastic and the product itself weighted nothing. It's not what I expected at all.
1.0,It was bent and it had a black line across it I'm returning it and getting my money back.
1.0,Sooooo big I cant used for my daughter 2 years old and I have a friend how have a 3 years old daughter and was the same huge!!!<br />Very disappoint!
1.0,Top fit great. The bottoms were very small
1.0,This watch just went dead on me. Not cool - I want a refund.
1.0,Made for a kid. I have a small head and this is extremely tight for me.
1.0,My daughter has worn this 2 time and the black elastic bleeds on your hands. She has ruined 3 pairs of tights because they are black from the elastic.
1.0,Size issue
1.0,Very Cheaply made! I was actually sent someone else's returned item (with their packaging) which I will return as well! Glued plastic that is sure to last one day.
1.0,The item I received look nothing like the photo on the site.  Waste of money. Gave one star because the item was received.
1.0,"Well I was simply disappointed since the package that came to me didn't fit even though I read lots of reviews. I'm a 32 DD, 115lbs (size 0-2) and ordered a medium. The bottoms fit (yes, they're pretty cheeky cut). But the top was WAY too big. As I packed it up to send back, they had paired a medium bottom with an XL top. Which explains a lot. A little frustrated with this."
1.0,There‚Äôs ZERO support..not enough spandex/to lose.
1.0,What when I first ordered these socks I ordered one pair they were awesome they fit great it did not slide down they did exactly what they were supposed to do I decided to order 6 more pair and the socks they sent me or not of the same quality they are not as long and they slide down to your ankles after spending $120 I feel like I was ripped off I would like to have six pairs of the socks that I originally ordered one pair of. You can email me Arthur Cohan@gmail.com or call and leave me a message at 845-406-1776
1.0,Loved the fabric. But it was too short and thats before washing. Returned.
1.0,"Do not waste your money on these.  I never write reviews but decided I needed to on this one because I don‚Äôt want people wasting their money.  Like other reviewers stated, the screw driver sucks and so do the screws.  It strips the screws making it impossible to get the screws out.  I can‚Äôt even use these.  I‚Äôm super disappointed!"
1.0,"!!! Excellent Watch, I am very satisfied with this purchase,I have owned this watch for several weeks  and I haven't had a single issue with it. It looks really nice; good clear face.<br /><br />After 2 weeks this watch stopping work no matter what I do. I am very disappointment."
1.0,"Bought my wallet got it June 17th 2018. It's now August 22nd 2018, a little over two months and my wallet won't power on. All I did was keep my wallet in my back pocket as most men due nothing more nothing less. I can't even get a exchange wallet due to it being past the 30 warranty. Highly upset, great product and quality bad warranty for a tech device."
1.0,This pair was manufactured in Jordan and is too small.  All the previous pair I've owned were manufacture in Vietnam and fit very well.
1.0,Poor quality and size doesn‚Äôt fit as we needed to.
1.0,"I am trying to figure out how to RETURN this shoe. As with others who gave one star, same problem.  Sole broke after 3 weeks of wear and air cushion deflated.  This is TERRIBLE for a shoe this expensive.  First time I spent this kind of money on a shoe for my son.  Frustrated that I don't know how to get my money back. Do NOT buy these shoes.  Keep scrolling..."
1.0,Very disappointed tiny beads the size of a peanut will return quality feels cheap not worth the cost
1.0,"The idea of these pants are nice, but the waistband is entirely too big. There‚Äôs no elasticity in the waistband and they constantly fall down. And don‚Äôt even think about putting your phone in the pocket, all it does is drag the already horribly huge waistline down. Super disappointed. Save your money!"
1.0,"This  top arrived used, dirty and stained"
1.0,"This item is not at all what it looks like in the picture. This mask is sized for a small child, not an adult of any size. It doesn't come down far enough to cover the neck."
1.0,They changed color within A month of wearing! No good
1.0,NOT AT ALL LIKE ADVERTISED.<br />these are most definitely a MID RISE/HIGH RISE jean. they are in no way a low rise. suckers came up to almost above my belly button. very disappointed in these.
1.0,Does not fit the standard roll up shades.  Much too large.
1.0,Cheaply made. The fabric balls up after only wearing less than handful of times.
1.0,"Poorly made, poorly fitted, poorly designed, poorly constructed. Strongly disliked this skirt. Do not recommend."
1.0,Liked the colors. Fits 2 sizes to small. Thought the material would be soft cotton but is polyester.
1.0,The fabric wasn't what I expected - it was more slinky feeling.  Did not like it and returned.
1.0,This went in the donation bin as soon as it arrived.
1.0,"they had holes in the toes after 3 days in the pool. very cheaply made, material is super thin"
1.0,"Couldn't return this fast enough. Super wrinkly and crunchy, not soft at all"
1.0,"I ordered an XXL for my 18 year old son, it was so small my 10 year old could fit it.  I had to return it."
1.0,Spandex! Not a sweatshirt material!
1.0,"It was way too small, and I had an ordered one size bigger just in case it ran small"
1.0,"So disappointed,  this size small was supposed to be the same as US EXTRA SMALL. It's impossible to find pajamas on this sight that are xs, so I was so excited to receive these, my mom is a size 8, and they are to big for her."
1.0,These are too small. And break easily
1.0,"This dress was not at all as pictured, other than being black it did not look like the picture at all. It was very straight and boxy, no shape and the V wasn't very prominent I'm the neck line. Fabric was thin and provided no shape. Doesn't hide or leave anything to the imagination if you have cellulite. Do not recommend."
1.0,I purchased the 2X. The arms were painfully small.
1.0,Ran super small bought an xl and fit like an xsmall
1.0,"They ripped the first time I wore them, I lifted my leg to step up into my truck and ended up with a 5in long rip. Cheap material will definitely be avoiding this brand from now on!"
1.0,Tried to cancel.  This was a duplicate order of gift order for my granddaughter<br />Will return items
1.0,Aweful indeed.  The suit is worse than if it was made for a dollar store.  Falls apart after a few uses in the water.  Avoid.
1.0,On the chart it's say size L but when it arrives here it was too small and plus the brand was really bad. I need to ship back this item
1.0,It's see through and runs a bit big. Probably best to get a size smaller
1.0,It looks very cheap nothing like what I thought I‚Äôd be getting.
1.0,"It‚Äôs beautiful, looks well made, but clip fell off after about 3 months of normal wear."
1.0,Was too big and quality was horrible.
1.0,Don‚Äôt waste your money on buying this blouse<br />The design is cheaply made. It looks horrible the flowers look like it was printed off of a cheap printer. Don‚Äôt recommend this product!
1.0,I took it back off of my watch the very first day
1.0,Terrible scratchy fabric! The size chart is undersized. Order wayyy up in size!
1.0,"Had to return.  It probably would have been a nice shirt, but I'd have to had it pressed professionally to remove all those wrinkles.  Unbelievable."
1.0,Could see thru the bottoms. Very poor quality! Guess u get what u pay for!
1.0,"I had been wanting this necklace for a long time, after getting it I was pleased at first but did not wear it much, but after about one month I notice that on the diamond side  about five of the diamonds had turned dark and very noticeable, had not got it wet or cleaned it with anything because like I said I had only wore it about four times, called Micheal Kors customer service and they told me that warrant was NO good after 30 days, I spend over 100 dollars for nothing, very disappointed customer service would not try to help me at all, was not trying to scam them just wanted my money's worth..... I think as high price as their products are they would try to please the customers better and stand behind their products......."
1.0,"This was a waste of money.  It keeps good time when it runs, but no matter how much it is wound, it stops frequently, sometimes in as little as 12 minutes."
1.0,"The first time I looked at these pants in person, I thought they looked like 100% polyester, but I was wrong. The tab inside one of the legs shows that these are 65% polyester and 35% cotton, but I'm just not feeling that cotton at all. It doesn't help matters that the seller listed these as 100% cotton pants when they're anything but.<br /><br />I don't like being deceived, and I don't imagine many customers do. These pants just have that polyester look to them (shades of the 1970s)!!! They're a nice color, and I like the way they are made, but the fabric feels awful in summertime in the south. It traps in every little heat molecule.<br /><br />The pictures of the fabric in the listing show a nice, soft cotton fabric normally used in sweats. The fabric itself doesn't show that.<br /><br />These are the furthest thing from 100% cotton you could find. I thought they were pretty first thing out of the package, but further inspection upon wearing the right pair of glasses proved otherwise.<br /><br />These can't be sweatpants if they're made of polyester, unless you mean in the sense of ""sweaty pants."" Polyester is soft but not comfortable or cozy. It is firmly against letting your skin breathe.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pass these by, find some honest to goodness 100% sweatpants that are made the same way - there are at least dozens of them on Amazon - and pass these by."
1.0,Very tight. Teenager couldn't get feet in the sock.
1.0,"Lovely color and great fit, but on first time wearing the lense literally popped out while I was sitting on a bench at our local zoo."
1.0,Cute but the metal grinds.
1.0,If I could rate this zero starts I would. I bought this bathing suite for my honeymoon. The fit is fine and it was very cute on arrival. As soon as I got into the water with this bathing suit the top dyed my skin black. I had to scrub to get it off. I have no idea why this would transfer on my skin but it was awful. I wish I was able to return it. You get what you pay for I guess.
1.0,"See through, material is not what I expected. I returned my items. I purchased light pink pair and dark pink pair."
1.0,I have had this for a month and the band fell off the connectors today.  Not happy
1.0,I ordered a large and it was way too big. Looks like it could fit 2 people in the dress.
1.0,Cute choker.
1.0,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the gloves.  The leather had a plastic feel to it, and despite the low cost the gloves looked cheap.  Ordered XL size, but what I got looked XS and would not go on my hands.  If he will have them, iI plan on giving them to my grandson.  Otherwise the go to Purple Heart."
1.0,"Way to small and tight, very uncomfortable, might be good for a 3yr old"
1.0,"First off all I received this product with the bag broken on both sides as shown. Second, the pins did NOT come with this band and it looks like someone had scratched the plastic housing where the pins go as shown. Maybe they were removed?<br /><br />Whatever the case may be, this will be a return."
1.0,"Nothing like the photo, a hole in the shoulder and would fit perfectly...if I were a 300lb box. I want my money back!"
1.0,I wanted to use the product under a dress I have and the product was loos and showed under the dress.
1.0,"Sunglasses came in 04/09/2019 and the tip of the piece that goes over your ear came broken. Every time I put the sunglasses on, I get scratched because of the exposed wire. I honestly was very excited cuz they looked stylish and for a good price. But oh man I hate getting something that‚Äôs faulty!"
1.0,Worst purchase.  Way too small.  No assist for a return
1.0,What a scam these things are. It's 50¬¢ worth of fabric. It's literally a cylinder of fabric. No hemmed or finished edges. Unreal.
1.0,"Didn't like these overalls at all, went well too low for my liking. I obviously I wore a shirt under them but it went a lot below my nipples which felt weird to wear around even with a shirt under. Also super awkward in the crotch area."
1.0,They do not serve any purpose<br />They don‚Äôt stay on and don‚Äôt absorb the sweat
1.0,Too small and had bleach stains
1.0,I can not recommend these for toddler. The toes come off easily and are not comfortable to walk. We do not use them because I am afraid of falling.
1.0,"I used the provided sizing guide and it was WAY off. I even went up one size. I ordered an XL and the bottoms were more like a Large and the top more like a Medium. The suit was super cute and the material was nice, but sizing was terrible. I returned."
1.0,"i didnt know that the lip bars were so short and they are too tight to my lip, i like them just wish they were longer. thank you"
1.0,Do not recommend this product it is cheap and stretches way too much doesn't give enough support you better off buying white sports bras from the dollar store they're the same type of material. Don't get fooled because it is not what it seems and ask for it other people that are recommending this product perhaps they're getting paid because it's absolutely a piece of s***! PS if you're wondering I have big boobs and I can testify that you will not be able to run or exercise in these sports bras.
1.0,Sizing not correct at all. Could have ordered a 5X and it wouldn‚Äôt have fit a Barbie doll.
1.0,Returned this because it was so small and not cotton it was cheap material
1.0,Cheap Swiss hand-made crap. Also no pedometer.
1.0,Wrong color but low price.
1.0,"Let me start off by saying that if I could give this product 0 stars, I would. When I opened the box I found inside 2 bracelets, one black and one brown, not the 10 I was promised. On top of this, both of them were just a braided plastic-y rope with no pattern or anything cool about them. This was an incredible disappointment as I was actually pretty excited for this product. Anyway, I'm just posting this to try to make other people aware and hope you can avoid my mistakes"
1.0,Buyer beware!!!Cute jacket but it came without the belt in photo and looks ridiculous without the belt. Am returning
1.0,Colors bled during washing and white polka dots are now blue.
1.0,"Fox ruined a perfectly good pair of riding pants by making the bottom 4 inches or so the mesh material that‚Äôs on the calf area. Why? I understand why the mesh is on the back of the legs. Almost all riding pants have that. But why carry it around to the front?? Finally, female specific riding pants that aren‚Äôt pink, blue or purple...and they look and feel absolutely ridiculous. Why would you ever think to make the bottom portion of the pants mesh instead of the same material as the rest of the pants? So disappointing. The pictures are very, very misleading. You cannot see this unfortunate detail until you actually have the pants in front of you. Tried them on and then sent them right back. Absolutely not worth the $115."
1.0,Sleep lounge pants shown on Amazon page make it seem product is leisurely roomy.<br />When delivered lounge pants were uncomfortable and tight in all the wrong places for a USA male.<br />Package's text and brand logo (avidloves.c0m) shows product is meant for ladies - not guys.
1.0,The loop at the end snapped after 1 month of use.  Terrible quality in design and products used. Do not buy
1.0,"poor quality, uncomfortable, ordinary"
1.0,feathers fell off consistently
1.0,These are probably the worst leggings I‚Äôve purchased so far on Amazon. They have zero compression in the waist and just constantly fall down. They material is stiff and harsh. I‚Äôd return them if I could get to the post office without getting COVID.
1.0,I thought this product would have feathers but it is a printed pattern on fabric
1.0,"Returning, this dress looks NOTHING like the picture. Very dissatisfied üëé"
1.0,Item was not as size chart stated.
1.0,"The sizes were off, not matching the label. Stay away from this vendor. Amazon will not refund, but make u pay posted fee."
1.0,I ordered extra-large thinking it should fit my size eleven(11)---Boy was I WRONG--FITS WAY TO TIGHT!<br />Returned them --
1.0,The hand strap broke on this product after 2 days using it. You get what you pay for and this is a very cheap Chinese product. Better off spending more money on something that will last.
1.0,"I ordered a girls US size 13 and received a European size 30, which is a girls US size 12. These were a gift and could not be returned since it was beyond 30 days after purchase. I'm very disappointed."
1.0,"Item doesn't look like the photos. Material feels and looks cheap. Doesn't fit well. I'm 5'-8&#34;, 150 lbs and purchased the small size."
1.0,"The material is shoddy , would sent back but misplaced packing material."
1.0,"not the same as the image and came in with smudge on class ,wasnt new"
1.0,Fake DO NOT BUY ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
1.0,"I've had this purse for 3 months now. 1. It's difficult to remove my firearm. It is a CCW purse. 2. The lining has a 1 1/2 whole in it. Of course, it was my house key that was lost in it. It's a beautiful purse. But, not functional as described and poor interior quality. I've had it 3 months now, so I'm not allowed to return it. Not a happy customer."
1.0,This turned my finger green.
1.0,"I just don't get it.  How do you put together a product with everything in place, well done and then finish it off with a none functional zipper?  It just doesn't make sense. I bought this jacket last year because I loved the color, I used it a couple of times.  Today I grabbed it first time for the season, rushing out the door to catch my taxi,  trying to get myself warm because I'm always cold, the zipper cannot function despite my best efforts. So I'm left with with my whole chest exposed to the New York VERY COLD WEATHER.<br />VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
1.0,The waist band got all twisted inside after one wash. They no longer fit.
1.0,"Very short arms & small around the body , if you order this order 2 sizes bigger than you need"
1.0,Runs very small. 3x was size of an xl
1.0,Size is not a true 2x
1.0,I didn‚Äôt get this item
1.0,"So disappointed, they turned black within a week. Had to issue refunds to customers who complained"
1.0,"This was a Valentine's Day gift for my girlfriend and she loved it! But, after a few weeks it began to tarnish. After six weeks it completely lost its beautiful white gold plated shine.<br />The seller was gracious enough to send a replacement, but after only two weeks this new bracelet is beginning to tarnish. Plated gold jewelry should not tarnish, certainly not this quickly.<br />Very disappointing.<br />Buyer beware."
1.0,It looks  like a woman‚Äôs blouse not a shirt for a man
1.0,It is cheap. The zippers were torn when received. I'll be returning.
1.0,Never even tried them on. Opened package and saw the string hanging from a seem and then noticed the hole in the crotch already. :(
1.0,Does not work. Was really disappointed because I was in love with the design and appearance.
1.0,"This scarf smelled like old lady perfume.  I had to wash it.  It does keep you warm, but it‚Äôs so wide and long, it‚Äôs hard to keep it wrapped around you."
1.0,Didn't like it. Turned my neck all green.
1.0,Not great quality and was seen crooked. So it sat really poorly on my body.<br /><br />Would not recommend.
1.0,"There is no like. They are pretty much like the originals, just different stiching. I followed the directions and had a very difficult time putting them on and off. A total waste of money and energy. Buyer Beware!"
1.0,Absolutely awful quality! Can totally see through it
1.0,partially see through but could work with a nude bra. the fit is good. my problem is the neckline!! looks nothing like the photo and is terribly made :( really disappointed because it looked really cute in the picture
1.0,"The gathering comes up under your chest and the rest of the shirt is to short. Almost like a Mid-drift shirt, little longer, but still. Looks like an old lady shirt.  Yuck!"
1.0,Just too big.  Maybe fits good if you have a head the size of a watermelon.
1.0,Really cute but one of the earrings lach broke the first try I put them on.
1.0,"The gloves were advertised for .99, we ordered 6 pairs and the S&H was nearly $20. standard rate. We were shocked but we needed the gloves for a performance so we ordered them. The gloves came on time. The material was cheap and one of all the gloves had a strong chemical stence. We had to wash all of the gloves. They were no tags on the inside to denote whether we had medium or large gloves. The only way to find out was the plastic wraps for the gloves. Overall I would not purchase gloves from this company again."
1.0,Only one jewel (I thought it was all of them) & too small for septum piercing.
1.0,I thought ordering from Amazon would ensure this would be a quality product. I was terribly wrong.
1.0,They look nice but they're a gift for Christmas.
1.0,WAY WAY WAY too big.  Normally order a large or x large.  I would of done well with a medium.  Returned it.
1.0,"The implication is that there are 3 heat settings, A, B, and C but the temperature display is adjusted by the plus and minus buttons.  It appears that you can set the values for A. B, and C, but no instructions on how to do so.  No instructions on the internet either.  When you set the temperature value using the Plus and Minus buttons, the value seems to apply to the A, B, and C selection without any logic.  I have no idea what the A, B, and C relate to.  No answers on Amazon either."
1.0,Mala calidad de producto.
1.0,i like them but they are way to heavy and they broke while i was wearing them so it was a waste
1.0,"First, the material is very costume - like. The sheen, the feel, the overall look - it screams costume. Second, if you have a longer torso, say hello to major camel toe. Like, for real the most uncomfortable feeling, unflattering, unhide-able camel toe. The pleats are not cute in person either. I honestly hate it. The quality, craftsmanship, style‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not there. Looked cute in pictures but sorely disappointed on this one."
1.0,It fits but it look cheaply made. Not worth the price. Very thin fabric and the sequins fell off all over the place!
1.0,Excited to get the earring opened the package very disappointed thy were very small and flimsy not worth the money at all. Don't waist your time or money.
1.0,"Skin tight around belly and hips, and so baggy on legs. I am 5‚Äô7, size 10 jeans, and hourglass shape. Large wouldn‚Äôt pull up past my hips, and XL was still tight. Terrible shape and zero stretch. Material is like a cargo tent ‚õ∫Ô∏è if you like that‚Ä¶ not for me."
1.0,It only fit 6-7 years old.  I had my  kids wear it and they can't even put it over their heads.
1.0,This made me look like Tony Soprano. Also can‚Äôt tell if I have exceptionally long arms or if this jacket just has too short of sleeves. Not a good look for me. Also smells like chemicals. Returned.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt work. Too flexible
1.0,Bought for<br />My brother. He wears a medium. This was a very small even x-small tight elastic band waist. Returned.
1.0,"Nice for about a week. Scratch very easily, now the mirror finish is rubbing off, definitely disappointed."
1.0,No aclara bien el talle compre y no era mi talla.
1.0,Cheap and not soft at all
1.0,"These... Are terrible. At first they looked beautiful, but the fit is awful. Theres too much extra fabric in the finger tips, and this makes it hard to use touch screens or really function.<br /><br />I also had the stitching come loose in multiple fingers. :/"
1.0,"Love the color, but why cant they just give the product as describe.. this dress is made of Raylon.. not really a fan of this material.. thats why I read what it's made of.. I thought this was cotton/spandex or polyester by the look of other reviews.. Also, this dress is narrow at the bottom.. so it has no flow.."
1.0,"Very pretty dress but it was already falling apart when I received it. Poor stitching at the top, first time I wore it it started to come apart!"
1.0,And this is a XL FOR ADULT WOMEN TERRIBLE IM ONLY GIVING IT ONE STAR CAUSE IT CAN GO LOWER
1.0,Terrible. The necklace broke the first time I even put it on. Very cheap. Do not buy.
1.0,This band was adorable. I have many of these kinds like this. But it broke on day 10. Super disappointing
1.0,"This product is NOT as advertised.  The photo shows the length at mid thigh, however the one I received drug the ground at least 5 inches!  I am 5'3""."
1.0,"Bought it in October, broke in December. Lasted less than two months."
1.0,Very cheap looking. Gave it away to a 5 year old for dress up playing.
1.0,I've purchased a pair of clip on frames similar to this two years ago and they were 100% better quality.<br /><br />These are poorly designed where the clip protrudes into the middle of your brow.  This prevents glasses from fully seating on your face and the added bonus of pain.<br /><br />Additionally the lenses are incredibly thin.  Kudos to the clip for at least having padding on the arms that touch your lenses.  But everything else is no good.
1.0,"First, the mask does NOT fit a 9 year old. It‚Äôs an adult size. Even for my 14 year, they are too big. Also, it has no metal nose piece to get it fit better. The description says cotton, it is not cotton. It‚Äôs polyester and spandex, apparently the lining is cotton but it don‚Äôt feel like cotton (I translated the sticker on the package). The ear loops are so thick, barely stretch and therefore, don‚Äôt stay tucked behind my 9 year olds ears. The one star is for the design and great feel, even if they‚Äôre not cotton."
1.0,I need to return several rings and exchange for 1 size larger.
1.0,Flimsy rubber product rips easily. Poor quality. Rolls up over breasts. I gladly paid to have it shipped back to the company in China. Terrible service.
1.0,Very disappointed bow did not come with  hair tie like pictured only a clip also much smaller than expected I paid more for this one since it had the hair tie there were much bigger bows with clip only with better prices. My daughter needed the bow for her dance recital on Saturday hopefully I can find a replacement before then.
1.0,"Very cheap, and I probably would have been happy with 1 out of 3.  Two pins were broken off and the third (the cross) was bent to the extent that to straighten it would break it off.  Not worth my time or effort to return an item this cheap, just learn from the experience."
1.0,This is a cute dress! Love the sunflower print and button detailing. Unfortunately it is cheaply made - one of the straps was unstitched in the back when I received it. Returning.
1.0,"I sent it back, the jeans were way too small!  I wouldn't recommend buying these.  If you like skinny jeans these are for you but be aware they run small."
1.0,"They were smaller than the stated size, they really were not ankle socks. Totally misrepresented what I received."
1.0,"In the picture this looks like a sweater. In reality, it is an incredibly cheap looking thin shirt material. I'll be returning because that is false advertising - too bad returns are not free. I feel ripped off."
1.0,Wayyyyyy smaller then says waste of money smh
1.0,This shirt I bought the largest size they had and I am a size L.  I bought xxl or xxxl. not sure.  Definitely was not made correctly.  I ended up donating it.
1.0,"I wear a pant size 22 and shirt size 3X. Weigh 290lbs and am 5‚Äô8. I ordered a size 3X in the swimsuit. The bottom fit good around the waist and length was good. The tops length was good it fell right at the thigh. It was a little see through which I liked. However, I have no idea what‚Äôs going on with the chest area! I wear a size 42DD and this tops cup size was way to small. All my chest goods were hanging out the sides and there was definitely nothing helping to keep them in place. The elastic under the chest and around the back was way too loose. Strapping it tight around my neck helped very little. Do not recommend! Thank god Amazon made it easy to return!"
1.0,I did not like the tighter elastic bands at the ankle and knee. All it did was make indentations in my legs and make them itch when I removed them.
1.0,"I was really excited about receiving this item until it arrived broken. I really needed it for this week because I am graduating with my doctoral degree. This was my way of having my mother with me for this very special moment. I can't even send it back because I am afraid I won't get another one in time and have time to put it together. I had to take the angel off, which is a bumper."
1.0,"The band cracked after 5 weeks of use, the leather is very stiff and not flexible."
1.0,Cheap fabric.  Not impressed with the quality.
1.0,Had these for not long and really really liked them upon receipt and got so many compliments. After really only a few light wears one of the nose things fell off and the other is extremely loose. This made these completely unwearable because they are so crooked now. Disappointing.
1.0,"I would not recommend this top for running. The material is thick and feels too heavy for warm weather running. The sizing guide recommends an XL for a 44 inch chest, but I find the shirt to be too large. The shirt looks nothing like the photo. I expected a somewhat heathered texture; the green is a solid matte looking color."
1.0,Very bad company they didn‚Äôt refund  you money if the dress isn‚Äôt fitting
1.0,looks stylish but  stop working in two weeks
1.0,"This item is not red. It is like brown or orange and I do not like the color. I am probably going to return it, plus the beads are too large."
1.0,"Very disappointed,  returning tomorrow."
1.0,"It fell of the first time I wore it, luckily my husband found it in the car.  The clasp is not secure.  I like the look of the watch but unless we can figure out how to fix the problem, I‚Äôll have to return it."
1.0,"These aren't very easy to install. The piece of silicone that you have to put through the small hole meant for shoestring is way too thick and it very hard to get through, I ripped one of them in half trying to get it through the hole. Once you finally get these on they are uncomfortable and the tongue of your shoe gets displaced because of how big they are. I constantly had to adjust the tongue of my she throughout the day for comfort."
1.0,This is a novelty item and not a working key chain.
1.0,"These are FAKE UGGS!!  The brand name is Koolaburra! What the heck is that?!?! My heartbroken niece had to return her gift immediately. I will order reorder a pair for her from the Uggs website. Very misleading, and disappointing"
1.0,This would be great if I had a conehead! It's huge! Who was it made for? Do not waste your money!
1.0,clasp never locked in place then broke piece of junk especially for what i paid
1.0,Runs small in chest area!
1.0,"Looked stylish. While ordering the size said ""US Large"". This is what we got in the mail. The tag even says ""US Large""."
1.0,I hate this dress.  The style is not the same and completely ugly!
1.0,These are Not Cotten ....polyester synthetic
1.0,The zipper jammed and broke after just one use. It was also a little tight and I bought a size up. I am repurchaseing this TWO sizes up and hoping I have better luck with it.
1.0,The sweatshirt has fabric balls already and only worn once
1.0,Don‚Äôt purchase from this seller. This hat was supposed to be as pictured. This hat was supposed to be a pink cowgirl hat with a tiara and a silver rim around the edge. The tiara was missing and not on the hat at all! Came in broken! There was also no silver edge.
1.0,I didn't receive the dress was given a top instead
1.0,These shoes say size 4.5 but are bigger than a size 6 pair of adidas cleats I just bought.
1.0,Being short makes this not a good look. I look like I need to be rolled down the hall to the juicing room
1.0,"Hi, im not happy at all Couse its turn black and i have to throu in The garbage next day &#62;:(...."
1.0,broke on the 2nd time I wore it it just came untied. No option to try and return????  just wanted a replacement
1.0,"I WOULD NOT BUY THESE SHOES!! No foot support whatsoever. It got so bad I had to go to the doctor who said these shoes gave me the gout. Moreover, they were bought less than two months ago and they‚Äôre already starting to fall apart? Unacceptable! I recommend and urge buyers to please steer clear of these. They are abhorrent quality and you get worse than what you pay for. So sorry for the bad review but have to be transparent. Thank you."
1.0,Returned. Not true to size
1.0,Ties could be longer
1.0,"I returned this dress as soon as I received it.  It is cheaply made, fits snug even though I order a larger size than I wear.  Most disappointed was the look of the dress.  It‚Äôs adorable on Amazon web site but in person looks so cheap.  Well you get what you pay for.  My first time ordering clothes that probably are made in China and will be the last time order clothing.  Don‚Äôt was your money or time on this cheap dress.  I did get my money back."
1.0,"Material is extremely thin, almost see through and cheap feeling.  Packaged terribly  Shipped in an envelope in a clear plastic type bag practically rolled into a ball"
1.0,Do not buy it!!!!!!  Very low quality! I will not give even one star. Hate it!
1.0,Wore them about 2 hours and snapped in half :(
1.0,The clamp is too small was so hard to clamp.
1.0,"These shoes are less than one month old and they are falling apart. The sole is falling off, resulting in a trip hazard. One of the metal eye rings has fallen off. My 3-year-old wears them daily to daycare, but it not especially rough with her shoes."
1.0,You get what you pay for. I returned it
1.0,Broke almost instantly bc its so thin and cheap
1.0,Horrible fit charger didn't work poor quality returned back
1.0,"Gem broke off of post after only a couple of wears.<br />Looked great, but poor quality :("
1.0,"Extremely small.  I ordered a large, more like a 28A"
1.0,Super cute design but within 24 hours both of the earring posts were completely bent and deformed. Really cheap quality. Don‚Äôt be duped by how cute these are. They won‚Äôt last long. Mine didn‚Äôt make it past the first day.
1.0,I thought it will be like Columbia shirts but the fabric is poor quality. The size is smaller than my normal size.
1.0,The smell when I opened the box was so strong! Like burnt rubber. Gave me a headache. Size is pretty accurate but when you put the boots on and tie it up it doesn't look  right. It doesn't hold its shape
1.0,Wow. So horrible. The material is very cheap and ripped easily. Not true to size and the worst part is it wasn‚Äôt long enough. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù .. Was The outfit was meant for a midget?(no offense to anyone) I had to literally pull the torso and try to stretch it. I planned to wear it tomorrow for my birthday now it‚Äôs too late.. I don‚Äôt even want to go out anymore. üòî
1.0,"They‚Äôre too big and don‚Äôt look nothing like in the picture, they look cheap, I‚Äôll gave them away, I was never going to use them."
1.0,"I liked this jacket online so much that I went ahead and bought two (navy and black). On the very first day I wore one of them, I picked up my toddler and a button broke off from the friction of my baby on my chest. The buttons on this blazer are made of cheap plastic, and they break off in such a way that they can not be sawn back in. I reached out to the seller for help since this happened to both my blazers, and they told me that they don‚Äôt have extra buttons and that I should ‚Äúbuy buttons in my local market‚Äù. Why should I pay for his blazer and then have to buy 12 new buttons to replace one broken one, considering I would have to make sure all the buttons match? I don‚Äôt have time to look for the same exact buttons, so buy this blazer only if you have that kind of time. Don‚Äôt expect the seller to assist you. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed."
1.0,Very small and tight.  Keeping them because returning them is too much trouble for the price.  Would not buy again though.
1.0,"if i could give it no stars, I would. This shirt was made of thin material, and seemed like the only appropriate use would be for a wet tshirt contest.<br />Don't waste your money."
1.0,"Do not buy this, it will break on you within a couple weeks."
1.0,I didn‚Äôt like them. They were too small even though I ordered a large. The material was thin and cheap looking and I‚Äôm sending them back.
1.0,"The first time my little girl wore it the loop on the side tore up, not a good enough quality!"
1.0,Does not fit my son. It kept falling off due to the wide frame. I can wear it myself.
1.0,Was broken when recieved.
1.0,Material is itchy- belt is awkward and shipping for returns is not paid for by the seller. Do NOT recommend to purchase this dress.
1.0,I was expecting this color. The shadez i received are much darker than this picture.
1.0,They were pretty shirts but cut very small.
1.0,My boyfriend's magnet fell off in less than an hour of wearing it on Christmas evening. Not well made. Perhaps they should reinforce the pieces a little better or send replacement parts so when they are lost an hour after putting them on...
1.0,Did not last a week
1.0,I received this item and as soon as I opened the package I knew they were too small.( I ordered a 2xl as I always order one size up for more relaxed fit.)<br />When I went to check the size the label had been cut completely off so there was no way to check what size was actually sent. Needless to say I didn't get to wear the product for a proper review.
1.0,They look nothing like this and the coloring is barely detectable.
1.0,"If you want something better go to a H&M store, there's cheaper shorts with a better quality!<br />Really bad quality, looks ordinary."
1.0,The patches on the arms are on the inside of the elbow not the outside. Not impressed at all!!!
1.0,Sorry.  I was disappointed.  I can't see through.  I saw folks at work with clear side views and thought these would be like the one's I saw at work.  Darn.
1.0,Was way too small. And I ordered up a size.
1.0,"The material is super itchy and- even for a girl with a short torso- it was too short and gave a wedgie. Would not recommend, you can find something better."
1.0,"Very poor quality - the upper layer is already coming off on all edges and sides only after a week of use. Save your money., do not buy."
1.0,"NOT ONLY DID I NOT GET THE DRESS I ORDERED, which was the: ‚ÄúSequin Mesh Evening Party Clubwear Off Shoulder Strapless Tassel Fringe Bandage Bodycon Dress (In Silver),‚Äù the dress I got was torn and broken in MANY different places. Not to mention, the bag said it was ‚ÄúNEW,‚Äù yet the bag that the dress came in was old and used. The dress also came wrapped in was old/recycled Victoria‚Äôs Secret tissue paper. The tag of the dress was also not attached, but yet it was inside a little silver pouch that came with a patch of extra dress ‚Äúfabric‚Äù and a broken rhinestone chain and some bent hooks... Extremely disappointed and looking to return the dress immediately and get my money back."
1.0,It‚Äôs not original I don‚Äôt think sooo.  The real one has a Santa Cruz logo on the side of the hat
1.0,It's cute but it has no elastic around the waist. It ripped as soon as I took it out the bag. I'm so disappointed!
1.0,"The finishing on the hem of these handkerchiefs has lose threads all over. Not only that, there are  knots in some places in the hem and shredded fabric in the end of the hem. I spent a long time trying to trim lose threads but there is no fixing this disaster. Also, the quality of the fabric itself is very poor. This company should be ashamed to ship out to a customer something if this quality. Now I have to scramble to find a gift to replace this one since I cannot possibly give anyone this garbage."
1.0,Colors are WAY off. I thought it was black but it's actually green. I had to return it
1.0,"Bought two necklaces. One stopped working within a minute of turning on. The other was shortly behind. Bulkier thsn expected, too."
1.0,Broke the first flight.  Plastic cracked.
1.0,Did not fit . Way too big
1.0,The shirt that was sent to me was not the design in the picture and is super ugly! The frills on the sleeve stick out and don't hang loosely as shown in the picture either. Very disappointed.
1.0,Mask is to thin to protect from anything. Product said it came with a filter and there is no filter. I will be returning the product for a refund.
1.0,"Earrings were very cute. However, they just put them in the shipping envelope without a box or bag and when I got them out one was so bent I couldn't easily open the earring. When I did get it open I wasn't able to relatch it.  Very disappointed."
1.0,The seam was right down the middle of the cheek. Which made the face look uneven. Poor quality control.
1.0,"I am unhappy with the quality of the lights.  The one we placed on the re wheel has already snapped and no longer works.  I am reluctance to exchange for another and not just return all of them.  My son was very excited to get then, but is very unhappy now."
1.0,While walking I went to stand and the shoe dented in and only wore them for 1 day
1.0,This product was described as having 2 back and 2 front pockets.  It does have 2 front pockets but no back pockets which was one of the deciding factors in my purchase - somewhere to put my phone!!
1.0,It's really looks good but poor quality
1.0,The kawasaki was printed crooked on the shirt.
1.0,Sooooooo shep and so baaaaaaaad
1.0,Crappy material....
1.0,They wont last more than one use. Once you try to pull it open to put on a tie it does not close.
1.0,Not anything like the color it shows
1.0,The writing on the jacket is very blurry.. very unhappy with the amount of money I spent on this
1.0,If this had a &#34;0&#34; I would give a &#34;0&#34;! Have worn twice and a stone has already fallen out.  The finish is dull and will not wear again. I would send back but I don't see where I can return this item.  Don't expect any quality in this jewelry.
1.0,Quality is subpar.
1.0,"It appears the money clip magnet has corrupted the credit card I carry in the money clip. Unfortunately, I probably didn't find our in time for a refund. It's a shame because it is a beautiful money clip."
1.0,The crystal fell out the first time wearing it.
1.0,Not much to say‚Ä¶ just look at the picture‚Ä¶. What I paid for and what I got. Definitively returning this.
1.0,My hat was smashed flat and did not come with a hat band. Does not even deserve 1 star
1.0,The band broke a couple days after I purchased it.
1.0,not made out of any type of sweat shirt or t-shirt material as pictured.  It is a very thin slippery material ...not good quality.
1.0,Wrong item was sent. These are not bulldog socks! And the quality is cheap
1.0,Basic blue one ply surgical mask made in China. Totally worthless.
1.0,"I am a size 0-2, I ordered a large so I could wear it larger with leggings. It‚Äôs super small and the material is weird, not sweatshirt/cotton feel."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt waste your money the plastic is cloudy and there‚Äôs nothing you can do to make it clear this looks like an upside down visor face mask.  concept is interesting, the product is flawed because the plastic is not clear/ transparent."
1.0,Poor quality cheep material<br />Unfortunately these masks won‚Äôt last you much longer than a couple weeks and non returnable
1.0,This product is not even close to being 2carets. Very disappointed.
1.0,Broken pairs too much to ship back - disappointef
1.0,"Worst durag I've ever had ,I have at least 50 rags ,about 10 different types and these are the worst.<br />First off they feel like a thick plastic bag with no flexibility your durag need some stretch ability for compression especially around the crown ,,these keep rising away from the crown of your head"
1.0,Love the length but after one wear the lace on bottom is tearing off.
1.0,"Both pair of glasses I purchased were defective,  and subsequently broke with in 6 months"
1.0,"Way to small.  They look good, but they will NOT fit an adult.  There is no way you could use these glasses for Santa or Mrs. Claus unless they are children."
1.0,"This showed up with at least 10 stones out, I returned it."
1.0,Never enjoyed it. Got stolen out my mail box.
1.0,"Very cheap, you can see through the jacket. I am returning right away."
1.0,"I will be returning this ASAP . The top doesn‚Äôt match the photo and has a STAIN on it , so nasty. Do not buy from here unless u want used ugly clothes from other people that returned this."
1.0,Cute but complete junk! Print on the shirts is fading after one wear.
1.0,I never received the anklet!!  Never received a response from the company on where it was.  And it it wasn't foe amazon I may not have gotten my money back!  Amazon was great but the company that sold the anklet not so much.
1.0,They are VERY small so disappointed
1.0,"Major design error with safety hazard. The butterfly wings cape need to attach to children‚Äôs neck. The adjustable velcro neck strap should not exist. If any person step on the wing (by the child himself/herself or others), the child would be choked. Very dangerous to put on. The butterfly wings should be carried on child‚Äôs shoulder or even arm, instead of their fragile neck. Very disappointed and concerned."
1.0,Brand name is really large on the wallet and isn‚Äôt cute. Wouldn‚Äôt let me return
1.0,I liked them but when I put them it was like looking through a bottom of a coke bottle
1.0,"The dress I received was not the dress pictured. The dress that was delivered to me was crepe paper thin, sleeves had elastic at the end that were incredibly tight and longer than pictured, has a ruched empire waist middle that was about 3 inches wide, the neckline was a V-neck instead of a scoop, and there were slits up the side."
1.0,"Broke after a handful of times wearing, used the extender that also came with it as it was still short on its own. Super disappointed for the cost of this and it break so easily. As of course I‚Äôm just out of the return window.."
1.0,These were like 3x too small
1.0,"Disappointed pure and simple. Cheap, fits weird, wouldn‚Äôt flatter anyone"
1.0,"They were horrible. My sons complained and gave up on these gloves. I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking when I purchased them, but I tried to make the best out of my daddy fail with this purchase lol"
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt like the material, looks like an undergarment.  I didn‚Äôt even try it on, returned it."
1.0,"This item runs REALLY SMALL. When I tried to return this item, the company‚Äôs return policy was so frustrating that I just decided to keep the item and leave a poor review instead. üòä"
1.0,This is not military grade at all would not recomend
1.0,I loved the material but unfortunately it runs too small in the chest area..I sent it back:(
1.0,Cute shirt but too small. Took out of packaging and washed in cold water. It came out in a child‚Äôs size. I ordered an XL knowing these shorts are usually small :(.
1.0,"Shirt was way too small and the sleeves were way too tight.  Returned the shirt, but never got a refund."
1.0,I bought a 3 xl and it was like a medium
1.0,Felt like an extra large can of busted biscuits with this one y‚Äôall. If you have ANY extra fluffiness I don‚Äôt recommend this at all!
1.0,Very cheap. I purchased a few silicone bands and this was my least favorite.
1.0,Was at too small. Only for size 8 or smaller
1.0,"The material and shape of this mask are nice, but that's where it stops.  The eye holes were to small or narrow for me.  Worst of all I needed a BLUE mask and this is nothing like the photo that convinced me to buy.  I understand color can be off based on your monitor, settings, etc.  That's not the same as ordering blue and getting bluish grey. It's totally different. Returning!"
1.0,"Received  a Yeti tumbler instead of the jewelry I ordered. Wouldn‚Äôt mind, except Yeti is a 2nd Amendment sellout and I wouldn‚Äôt give a dime to support their Anti American sentiment.  I will, however, enjoy blowing it up with my 2nd Amendment protected firearms."
1.0,This was supposed to be Much Lower cut based on pictures.  Horrible. And unflattering  Will return
1.0,No era lo que esperaba.
1.0,"I had to return the dress, it was too short."
1.0,Received today and am returning. Very cheaply made. Seams look like they would fall apart after washing. Very small in chest area.
1.0,"The magnet was defective, doesn't clasp.  Wasn't worth my time to try to return all the way to China, so I threw it away.  I guess I should have realized with the low price."
1.0,Thin material and runs super small. Can't even wear it. Gave it away
1.0,Ripped during the first wear. My daughter was so upset.
1.0,"Although the instructions are clear, I consider the adhesive is of a very bad quality and does not hold well. I was planning on using this bra for my wedding dress, but as soon as I put it during on of my fittings I took it away immediately. The bra does not hold well on my breast and I wouldn't recommend this product for somebody with a medium or large breast. Definitely not what I expected."
1.0,Not a nice type of fabric as I was expecting something thicker for professional wear and was very disappointed.<br />It sags in all of the wrong places and is extremely unflattering. Slick feeling fabric doesn‚Äôt lay flat and flattering like the pictures.<br /> Legs aren‚Äôt wide enough to be flattering.<br />Belt is too short.
1.0,Lasted a few hours before my heels broke through the bottom. The same thing happened to my bridesmaid.
1.0,"Was excited to receive and use these, except when it arrived it did not come with the 10 metal cord clips which was the ONLY reason I bought them."
1.0,So dang cheap.<br />It looks like a polyester nursing gown.
1.0,It‚Äôs an ok dress. Fit is small.
1.0,Material does not compliment larger body types
1.0,This shirt is not what I expected at all... First off it is completely see-through there would be no way you would be able to wear it without something under. I expected it to be a nice shirt for a hot summer day but now I don't want to wear a tank top under it I'm attaching pictures I held it up to the light just so you can see how sheer it actually is.
1.0,Didn't realize when I purchased that they wouldn't take returns.  What's up with that?
1.0,Worst socks ever and too expensive. They are like carbon fiber rags. They grab everything and ball up lint. Can't believe I cannot return this trash.
1.0,"If I could give it a zero, I would. I bought 2 of these, and neither one worked. I was planning to give them as gifts, but they are useless. If they had worked, they would be nice watches. I plan to return them."
1.0,The sizing is terrible and the quality is really cheap
1.0,Cute but didn‚Äôt fit me good.
1.0,Material has all shredded on second wear. It‚Äôs just unbelievable.
1.0,Sizing is way off on this!  I wear a xx large and couldn‚Äôt even begin to get it on.  Had my daughter try it on and it‚Äôs fit her.  She is a small.  I do not recommend guessing if this item will fit.
1.0,"they were too large for me, so didn't use them."
1.0,The nose pads get bent every time you refold them .
1.0,They broke during my second time wearing them. Not even worth the $5.00 I paid for them.
1.0,Came with a better one.  Waste of $6
1.0,Wore one time and the lace split. Garbage!!
1.0,"Shirt is not flattering at all, it just bags in weird spots then is way too tight in others. I don‚Äôt know what type of body this was made for, but definitely not made for someone with a bust... it just sits weird. The bottom is not straight as shown, it sags so oddly in front, and hangs way down, and I do mean way down, hit mid-thigh. And the back is hitting me at the top of my butt, so it looks so bizarre when you view from side ‚Äì laughing, actually any angle is not a good angle.  The bust area is extremely tight, I wear a ‚Äúd‚Äù, but, this is cut for someone with like a ‚Äúb‚Äù cup only. Sorry, but would not be caught outside in this thing. Very disappointed with the quality of this shirt and the fit is nothing short of horrid. Can‚Äôt recommend."
1.0,Dumb
1.0,It's a women's shirt not for men the cut on the neck is not correct
1.0,"Too small, nothing like the picture"
1.0,Not easy to put on or take off. dislike
1.0,"This dress was cheap made in China. Wrong pattern, wrong material and wrong fit! I'm 5ft 8 and it doesn't even cover my private area."
1.0,Came with a hole in the leg. ‚òπÔ∏è
1.0,I was really disappointed when I ordered these cute coffee mugs for the lake and without even unwrapping them I noticed all but three were broken. Not Happy!
1.0,"They fit as advertised and look as advertised.<br /><br />-The quality is substandard.<br />-The cord to tighten the shorts is too short and was inside the elastic when the shorts arrived.<br />-the ‚Äúspandex‚Äù under shorts are no where near tight or spandex. They are equally as wide as the outside shorts.<br />-the waistband elastic is twisted up inside the shorts.<br /><br />Overall, a poor choice. Save your money and buy the real version of these shorts."
1.0,"I did not like the material, they were stretchy material, it did not have a good fit to them and they were to tight"
1.0,Super cute and comfortable buutt paint started wearing after 3rd days of use.
1.0,I'd ordered a beautiful turquoise bag. But received a navy blue one (see picture). Now I'll spend my time returning this item only as the product hasn't been described correctly.
1.0,"They feel good, but will not stay on my feet."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt waste your money! I was so excited to treat myself to these adorable pajamas. However, all I received were the bottoms- no top- and they bottoms were very worn."
1.0,Size is too small. It was listed as a womans drawstring hoodie but when i received it in the mail it was more like a childs garment. Was not happy with it!!
1.0,"I dislike everything about this product.  The cut is terrible, it is not a brief as described.  It is skimpy, but the legs are too wide.  The fabric is uncomfortable and feels as if it will fall apart with much movement.  I ordered them to use for a hospital stay, expecting to use extras for overseas travel.  That's not happening."
1.0,"I bought this band for my Coros Pace 2 sport watch, which I wore 24/7.  I really liked the configuration of the band, and it was comfortable and dried quickly.  The stitching around the velcro wasn't great and the ends of the nylon frayed a little, but it held.  But... one day I was just walking along and heard something hit the ground.  I looked down and it was my watch.  The pins had come out of the little detents that hold the band to the watch.  Thinking maybe I had caused the issue (didn't have the pins fully seated or something), I carefully reattached the band, and things were fine for a while.  Then, it happened again.  Only this time I didn't realize when it occurred.  I spent an entire day retracing my footsteps and calling everywhere I had been, but no luck.  I doubt the seller is going to replace a $200 sport watch because of a poorly constructed band, so I guess that is what I get for purchasing a product with so few reviews.  My fault for not throwing the band in the trash the first time it detached.  Save yourself buying a new watch and get something that is better quality."
1.0,"Product only came with one sword even though majority of photos show two swords. My young son was very disappointed with this. Product is poorly made. Spray paint is all over the turtle shell. See photos. Seeing as Halloween is around the corner, I don't feel like returning it and trying to find another so it will get used, but the listing of the product is deceptive and the product itself is very lackluster for the amount of money it costs."
1.0,"I really, really wanted this to be a win.  I did.  It looked so cute in the pictures. But, when it arrived, the fit was poor. To be fair, I did order up two sizes. I normally wear a medium but went with an XL since these ""overseas"" sellers tend to have clothes that run small. That was a mistake. The fit on this dress was huge.  That is totally my fault. I am curious, had I bought a smaller size, as to how well this would fit.  But, the reason I am returning this dress is it just looks cheap. I don't like the cutouts on the bottom.  The top row of cutouts is only on the front. It doesn't continue around to the back. Not good.  As the cutouts are on the skirt, which is the main part of this garment, you would think the design would continue around to the back.  I also didn't care for the fabric. It seems see-through to me.  Just not happy. This is going back."
1.0,"Had to throw them away.  Too small, odd shape made them impossible for a 18 month old to walk in them.  Very poor construction."
1.0,"Made for a larger head, it looks cheap and cheap..."
1.0,Charms were not connected to bracelet.  They were just sitting in the bag when I removed the bracelets. Very disappointed.
1.0,It runs very small and the material is very cheap
1.0,Worse material ever
1.0,"Does not look like picture at all !!!! Horrible fit, cheap material and see through. Proportions all off and red is more orange  -_- annoyed!!"
1.0,Arrived with the flower already broken off.not impressed
1.0,THIS IS A TERRIBLE WATCH.  IT DESERVES NO STARS.  BROKE THE 1ST DAY!
1.0,Adhesive is terrible only seemed to stick to my nipples. Left a weird outline around the edge that I was fighting all night. If you have little boobs this probably would work since gravity isn‚Äôt as big of an issue. I wear a D and that‚Äôs what I order so order at your own risk.
1.0,"I literally just took it out of the box. Not the same product pictured at all! I am 5'4&#34; and small,  I normally wear petite clothing as I am short. This only came to my butt, not past my knees like in the photo. It looks like it would fit a 10 year old child. I ordered medium. The material is very thin and will not keep you warm. It is not the same shape either, and mine has a hole in it. Very disappointed,  as the photo looks great. Will be returning asap."
1.0,"The material is scratchy, cheap polyester. The sizing was correct, but not if you're busty. The chest area stretches but looks ridiculous if you have a large bust. The shape also made me look like a grown child. Not flattering. The elastic on the arms is SO tight, too. Very uncomfortable. I couldn't wait to take it off. This was a big fail unfortunately. The only plus was the pretty shade of green."
1.0,"Sizing is wrong, wayyyy too large. I'm 5'2 110 pounds and the small was not even close to fitting. Would've returned it but didn't try it on it time. Will be donating it!"
1.0,"Looks like they would be beautiful, but the problem is you have to pull a chain through your ear. Ouch. I tried to put these on, but threading the chain through my ear hole was so painful, I had to take it out right away. Horrible design. I wouldn‚Äôt wear these unless someone made me. Not sure how much the model was paid to wear these, but it probably wasn‚Äôt enough."
1.0,These do not work at all on touch screen phone.
1.0,"Not a slim fit shirt.  Pretty boxy more like a classic cut.  Arm holes are small and waist are bulky and not tapered.  The chest and waist are the same measurement, not as pictured."
1.0,Love the size and love Totes but this umbrella broke the first time I used it.
1.0,"These masks are huge and extremely rigid.  They are nothing like the picture.  If I had not taken the film off of one them for my daughter's performance, I would have returned them for the full refund.  She could not wear them and it was a total waste of time and money."
1.0,It's a toy
1.0,Too big on bottom and didn‚Äôt fit right on top
1.0,"I like the concept, but these were just missing something.  They don't hang like the they do on the model. They probably needed a little more weight to them."
1.0,"I ordered a medium and when they came, they just fit my daughter who wears a size 0. I should have returned them, but they were perfect for her so they kept them. I'm so disappointed because I really liked them."
1.0,received dress with huge tear down the side! super disappointed because it's gorgeous. would really like to be contacted about a refund or replacement.
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes too big so it would fit loose and comfortable. It doesn't come half way around and sleeves were so tight it felt like it was cutting off circulation.  Don't buy these. I had to give a star to post it it doesn't deserve one
1.0,"My god this dress is awful. Completely sheer, wonky af, just all wrong!"
1.0,My head was not big enough to wear this hat frontwards or backwards
1.0,This would be good for a midget. This is a pathetic excuse for a belt
1.0,"I was so excited to put these on for the first time today, but they are extremely short (mid-thigh) & already totally destroyed by holes and runs everywhere! I am severely disappointed and sad these didn't work out! I will never be buying this brand again! 0 stars!"
1.0,"This item , turtle earrings is a joke! So fake , in the advertise picture it looks nice but it isnt. It's just a cut out cardboard. Yuk and now I'm stuck with it only because I'm not paying postal service ."
1.0,I try anything and when I seen this I had high hopes.  This is a piece of junk and I returned it asap. I don‚Äôt know if this is the one on social media but I didn‚Äôt like it.
1.0,The dress had the princess  head cut off
1.0,Not even a month that I've had these did all the 'gold plating' come off and left my ear piercing holes with black residue!
1.0,Terrible. Fell apart after 1 week.
1.0,Really didn‚Äôt care for it after 2 days of use not worth the full amount
1.0,This was meant to be a Christmas gift. The chain isn't as shiny as in the listing. It looks like something out of a gumball machine. It arrived tangled in knots and the chain was in pieces.
1.0,Awfull
1.0,"I bought the size indicated for me. Wore them and the zippers, even though were covered with the shield given, rubbed so bad I had a  cut mark.  Sadly I'm not happy with them and the way they fit.  They're very uncomfortable"
1.0,"If people like this kinda thing, I am extremely out of touch because it is hideous. It's just quilting cotton, in calico colors that look leftover from a wholesome Thanksgiving table runner. Not quite a full circle (so not literally a tablecloth) but it really looks and feels like something my mom would have trotted out of the basement as an ugly ""tradition"" from the 70's. And they say the waist is ""free size"" but that could not be further from the truth. A ""free size"" literally wraps around & around you, and you tie it as you see fit. This is not open all down the side, it's closed, and the maximum waist is exactly 44"" - not a small number, but it's also not ""free size."" It's drawstring in the laziest way: just leave waistband ends open, and any person who has a very small waist will wind up with TONS of fabric bunched up around where it is tied.<br /><br />It might fit a size L/XL (Target sizes, not designer sizes) best; that would give you enough drawstring slack at the waist to tie a bow, without too much excess fabric bulking up beneath it. Even then, it would make the perfect cosplay if you're dressing up as the Thanksgiving tablecloth at a Sunday school in 1970's Ohio."
1.0,It‚Äôs not a towel that will soak up the water on ur body. It‚Äôs more like if u already dry and just want to put on a towel before u change into ur clothes. Don‚Äôt expect it to absorb anything.
1.0,looks cheap! feel cheap
1.0,"The first time I wore this bracelet, the clasp broke and it fell off. Disappointed."
1.0,"I made an order two times.  The first jacket was too small.  and the second jacket was delivered with a broken zipper. zipper is broken in several places, the quality is disgusting.  I can not return the goods because I am not in the United States.  This product was supposed to be a Christmas present for mom.  As a result, a spoiled holiday and mood.  I do not advise buying.  disgusting service."
1.0,"I had high expectations for this bra considering the reviews. Unfortunately, it was just hype and it doesn‚Äôt work at all!! When I pulled on the strings it wouldn‚Äôt tighten at all! Notice how the reviews are not verified purchasers. Just want to mention that I‚Äôm a 32D so theoretically the bra should have made my boobs look fantastic ! Buyer beware!"
1.0,My daughter did not like the feel of this dress. She is very picky when it comes to the feel of fabric for her clothing.
1.0,mal√≠sima tela
1.0,This run VERY small
1.0,The ball/arrows at the ends are super small and extremely hard to line up to screw back on once in ear.  The ends also arrived rusty.  Not something I plan to put through my ear.
1.0,Cheaply constructed with poor quality materials- after a single use and a moderate shake to clear excess water it proceeded to fold almost in half at the locking mechanism and will no longer close.
1.0,Broke off in a day
1.0,First let me say these are so cute and just what we were looking for to go with our uniform requirements for school and the price was great. But for everyday use the straps have given out in less than 2 months. We have tennis shoes for PE days and so these shoes sit under a desk all day and have 15 minute recesses on the playground. Unfortunately the return window has closed on this purchase so I can't even return them.  I hope the pair I choose to replace these with last us longer. More than a little disappointed.
1.0,"What a joke, face shield barely stays attached to the hat.  You have to have a tiny head for hat to fit."
1.0,"broke when it dropped; i didn't think jade broke so easy. glued it. then it turned to copper. Im allergic to copper. needs to be sterling silver, didn't say it was coated. not satisfied need improvement."
1.0,Cane damaged with a hole in the pocket
1.0,If you don‚Äôt like to have your closet full of dollar store glitter don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs nice you can work it out but the glitter is killing me !
1.0,"Dress arrived poorly made and defective, difficult to return and get money back"
1.0,I will be returning this. It is see thru and the material feels like it‚Äôs too lose and stretched out. Definitely a horrible purchase unfortunately:(
1.0,Extremely see through. I was not even able to wear
1.0,These are really cute but they fell apart. I put the lenses back on the handle but they continued to separate.
1.0,Its way too small. Nice purse but for a baby
1.0,These glasses were bent and scratched!
1.0,Very thin see through. I returned it
1.0,Poor quality. Snap on buttons not installed properly
1.0,Hate it....actually look like a cow in it.
1.0,Not at all like the pictures or expectations
1.0,"One of the three (whale pattern) had a large, domed button to cover the zipper, which would push into my daughter's throat/chest when she's sleeping on her stomach, so we will be returning this set. I didn't even put it on my daughter to check the fit. The fabric seemed good add the patterns were cute, but the uncomfortable button makes it useless. The button was also pretty loose, I wouldn't trust it to make it through a washing machine. The other two outfits in the set (black and white stripes, teal stripes) had a regular flap over the  zipper."
1.0,The bigger heart one didn‚Äôt screw in correctly
1.0,size runs very small.  Purchased an XL and it fit snug
1.0,Got these shipped to me and it only goes up to a C cup... the description says it goes to D
1.0,"Short in the body, but has adjustable straps. Unfortunate, cheap and flimsy you can definitely get a better feeling tank top than this"
1.0,Used worn socks sold as new. The heels showed wear from repeated use.  I became alerted to the problem when they arrived in a ziplock freezer bag. Returned the item immediately.
1.0,These were the worst quality pins and bracelets I  have ever purchased. I would not recommend them to anyone. I wore a pin and the plastic backing fell out immediately. I wore a bracelet and it broke within a few days.
1.0,The cut is bad. Not worth buying. Very disappointed
1.0,"These are a very flat, bland colors.  The metal clasp it a cheap flat silver square with 2 stubs coming out of the back that you have to press into the watch band.  This takes some work.  Then If you have small wrists like I do all the extra band Is inside the band. These are cheap dollar store type items.  Extremely disappointed."
1.0,This is a child‚Äôs hat. The description is misleading
1.0,"So cheap and see through! Also, I ordered a medium and they are like a XXL. Just awful!"
1.0,"Not breathable at all! I have other masks of similar material that are fine but I didnt even try to put a filter in, its that bad. All it does is redirect my breath to the sides and is very uncomfortable"
1.0,Too simple for the price!!!
1.0,The product itself was not bad. I am very disappointed because I put them on and I‚Äôm wearing them around the house and both of the inside pockets are torn. Can‚Äôt return them now though I did just wore them for six hours ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1.0,"Not Guaranteed Prime 2-day delivery.  No cami received with dress.  Embroidery is nice, but the dress doesn't look anything like the photo.  Disappointed on all fronts.  It fits as expected IF you use the measurements given.  I'm 5'3&#34;, 120 pounds.  The dress was very long and frumpy."
1.0,The plastic piece holding the strap broke after 3 uses.
1.0,I DONT LIKE..
1.0,Ver y bad quality the bracelet rusted in a week
1.0,"OMG!  This necklace was a joke.  I seriously laughed when I opened it.  DO NOT go by the pictures.  So sending this back.  I can‚Äôt believe they actually mounted a diamond that small.  Seriously.  Don‚Äôt waste your time.  If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it probably is.  That price was literally what it‚Äôs worth.  You‚Äôre getting no bargain.  Trust me"
1.0,These broke after only wearing them a few times. I'll keep the frames and wear the clear lens on evening rides until they break too.  Going with a less expensive option from Suncloud for my go to daytime riding sunglasses.
1.0,NOT SILK. 100% polyester
1.0,"Not the same product. Cheap plastic material, wrong tassels, just not at all what is advertised. Don‚Äôt waste your $!!"
1.0,The quality of this dress is terrible. I would not buy this again or wear it ever. Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,Dress was super cute but very long on me. Almost down to my ankles.  I was expecting it to be right above the knee as soon in picture.
1.0,Cheap product. The ears are just foam pieces glued to a headband. They broke after 5 minutes of wearing them.
1.0,"The stitching is poorly done. The material is scratchy, like a potato sack."
1.0,The shorts are extremely too large. Feels like a dress.
1.0,Quality socks. Not as pictured. Not even close except color
1.0,"I bought 2 paxks of these for both of my children but had missing animals on the lanyards.  We would love a replacement as these are really great for their masks. Also, the yellow lanyard is hanging on by a string"
1.0,"I was gonna give 5 stars because of the quality.My son wore 3 times!<br />The 1st time,the left shoe went out in like 4 hours.2nd time ,after 2 hour charge as recommended, both went off in about 4-5 hours.3rd time,left stayed off!!!"
1.0,When I got item all that was in it was a crappy looking bracelet no earrings or necklace. The quality is horrible
1.0,didn't stiffen the felt hat that I tried to use it on.  it felt like i sprayed it down with hairspray initially. hat still maintained it's color and the sticky feeling went away. but did not affect the stiffness of the hat at all
1.0,Poor quality.<br />Jumbo size.<br />Returned the item two weeks ago.<br />No response nor refund yet.
1.0,So sheer cheap quality
1.0,"Not like the strap that came with my watch. Very cheap, not secure."
1.0,"This doesn't look anything like the photo .. not even the same dress. The dress I got is pink, not grey, has ugly thin grey ribbon for shoulder straps, NOT the ones in the photo. The arm bands are totally different and horrifying, not even attached to the dress like the photo either. Dress isn't long like the photo either... It's just horrible. It's really, really bad."
1.0,"These are not 42 mm. These are at least 45 meaning they are for toddlers and big kids, not babies. The sizing is off so these are going back."
1.0,Not as pictured. I got some butterfly necklace.
1.0,I can't get the damn things open to even try to get in my septum. So I know for a fact if I can get it open with pliers I won't be able to get it out which is inconvenient as for my job I have to be Able to swap them out.
1.0,Se rompi√≥ el palito de atr√°s de uno de los aretes el primer dia
1.0,"Horrible quality.  The arms came unfinished, and I can't even cut the extra tulle off because the edges of the embroidery don't meet up.  I should know by now not to buy clothing from Amazon."
1.0,I was so excited to get these and I loved them! So cute. Then I wore them for a week and the price showed. They became loose and fell of my face. I took good care of them. They are cute for cheap sunglasses but are cheaply made so just don‚Äôt expect to much.
1.0,I wear a American size 8 pants and I bought a size 3X because I wanted these to be extra comfy. Nope. These are more like a size 2-4. I would just skip them all together and buy something else unless you are super tiny and buy a huge size.
1.0,Arms too small. Not proportional to the rest.
1.0,Necklace broke after wearing first time
1.0,"Item was a good idea in theory but not in execution, some of the stones have already came out and that was just in my getting and opening package, hopefully others will have a better experience."
1.0,"Extreamly cheaply made, the adjustment pins on the bottom grill was broken when it came in , and the molding wax does not work!!!"
1.0,Product for adults. Was advertised in kid section
1.0,If you like silky feeling pants then you will like these. I was hoping they were cotton and had a bit of stretch. For this type of pant this is a really weird material!!
1.0,"The feather on one of these was bent.  I had to wet it down and put a book on it to dry it flat.  Otherwise, ok."
1.0,I bought this for my mother after my dad passed away because he always put her bracelets on for her. She couldn't get it to work for her. Maybe it's just my mother or maybe it's the product either way I returned it.
1.0,Dollar store goggles for $10. Not worth it
1.0,Only got to wear it once and when I washed it the straps brokeüòë
1.0,I wish I had not even ordered this!
1.0,Sizing way way off<br />It would have fit a 8 year old not my 12 year old
1.0,"Junk, not at all recommend"
1.0,This says machine wash and I washed it once and the pocket tore off. I was disappointed cause it was so cute... But very cheaply made
1.0,No size listed
1.0,Completely junk. Aluminum foil is thicker than the case.
1.0,Did not meet my expectations at all very disappointed
1.0,"I'm a size 8 so ordered a large in this top, It was so extremely small that i couldn't even button the buttons on the front. Very short, even with high waisted denim. So disappointed because other reviews were favorable and I think it's so cute. Maybe I just got one that was sized incorrectly? Returning :("
1.0,"This thing looks nothing like the images and it's terrible quality. Oh yeah, the size is ""mediuN""."
1.0,returned due to color
1.0,My ring was gold plated and supposed to be black there was an extra ; on the end of best dad ever!; for some reason and the size was to small. Waited almost 2 months for them to get it absolutely wrong.
1.0,For the time it took to get to me wasn‚Äôt worth it I could have got the same one out a little 25c vending  Machine at a food loin. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money on it it‚Äôs just a rubber band with beads on it lol . Already broke only had it out the pack 5 minutes... highly disappointed should have made sure it wasn‚Äôt coming from China.
1.0,Dress was way too small and way too short it barely came down over my butt.
1.0,Came from China and looks nothing like the picture. One of the stones is loose and out of the setting.
1.0,"This was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! The material was 0%. I had to find another option for the occasion. It‚Äôs so sad, because the dress COULD have been awesome."
1.0,"The strap on the bag broke within a year. Specifically, the part holding the strap came apart and frayed (see photo). This happened after just normal use ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt misuse it in any way. I bought the bag in July 2019, and it sadly broke before quarantine in March."
1.0,Looks more like a Night gown. To much time pay for something to sleep in.
1.0,Not see through. Waist too high that the crouch is too low. Had to fold the waist over so the crouch rises enough so I could run in them. Great other than that.
1.0,Very poor quality and fitting.
1.0,"Broke after 1 use. Metal clasp came off, and I had to throw it out."
1.0,I ordered a 2xl and it's like a medium!!!
1.0,"NOT LIKE THE PICTURE . Bow is manufactured in the middle of the ring, not to the side. It's useless"
1.0,Could not wear. Arrived with seam apart up the side.
1.0,Way way way too small to be a medium.
1.0,These jeans not only took weeks to get here they were way larger than a 12. I would not even call them boys jeans. They would definitely fit a grown man.
1.0,Look like a robe!
1.0,"These came up in my search for &#34;tragus earrings&#34;. They were larger than my tragus, the post is thicker than the piercing. The ball/fastener is in the back so pretty much impossible to put in. Will definitely be returning."
1.0,"Just want to give a quick thank-you to the Amazon community for taking the time to write your reviews!<br /><br />I finished watching the zoom Binocular Sunglasses commercial and thought to myself. 'This is something I could definitely use!""  I mean, the commercial made these things come across as a no-brainer, must purchase.  I was blown away at what they would be able to do!<br /><br />Then I saw the price and alarm bells started going off.  Can they really deliver the product as advertised at that price?<br /><br />I came to Amazon to check the reviews from my fellow consumers and thank God I did.  It's unfortunate that I get to benefit from other people's misfortunes, but without your reviews, companies such as this will continue to prey on the consumer.<br /><br />Thanks again for all of your reviews!"
1.0,Material was thin and felt very cheap. I would not wear this dress with such poor quality.
1.0,They were refurbished. The hinges didn‚Äôt even match and the frame was bent.
1.0,Weird material took forever to receive bad fit
1.0,It‚Äôs stretchy material that is not flattering
1.0,"it looks great and fashion, very nice material but the clasp HORRIBLE... i lost the band the same DAY i received it,, NEVR buy it unless they fix clasp flaw..."
1.0,"The sweater I ordered was called ‚ÄúGrey‚Äù. In the picture, it should resemble a ‚ÄúNightmare before Christmas‚Äù image pattern.  But there are ALOT of problems.<br /><br />First, the ‚ÄúNightmarish‚Äù imagery is not clear.  Even the iconic mountain fails to be recognizable as it lacks the curl pictured in the display.  The witch is nothing more than a spooky looking tree and Oogy boogie is missing his flipped over top and looks more like jello.... My friend, a huge fan of the movie, was not told what this was and things he listed as being on the sweater; an otter (a bat), a cooked shrimp ( the mountain), a seahorse...<br /><br />Next, it was sewn completely inside out!  The colors are a full reverse from the display and there are obvious seams that keep you from simply reversing it. Though, reversing it does nothing to help the Nightmare Before Christmas Characters and setting be more recognizable.<br /><br />And last, but certainly not least, the sweater is unraveling at the neck line and all I did was try it on.....<br /><br />Sadly this is a big issue that is happening on Amazon.  You can‚Äôt trust the pictures shown to be what you get as it is flooded with cheap Chinese knock offs.  This will be returned."
1.0,Poor quality and hand wash only. Definitely not intended for active wear. We returned.
1.0,No me gusta el estilo
1.0,"I wanted to like this dress but unfortunately I‚Äôm quite disappointed. The sizing is way of. If you want it to fit like like the actual photo, you‚Äôll have to purchase 2-3 sizes up. I purchased my actual size based on my body measurements according to their chart, it fits me like a too small T-shirt or tank top & bottoms won‚Äôt go past my butt. The material is also not the best of quality either. So disappointed and returning."
1.0,I love this but broke second day I wore it
1.0,Item I recived was and old model. Not as portrayed in the picture
1.0,"Clasp did not work and had to send it back. Clasp also appeared flimsy in comparison to the watch itself, which is large and heavy. Definitely was not what I had in mind when I ordered it."
1.0,The yellow tinted makes it hard to see and they didn't help with the glare. Would not recommend
1.0,"I have these with the pink trim so decided to get them in black. The black ones gave me horrible camel-toe. Went to return them thinking that maybe I would just exchange them for another pink pair, since those worked ok. Ended up with a $7.25 charge for &#34;shipping'. If you are thinking of trying them, please keep in mind that return shipping is at least that or more, depending on where you live. I found it irksome that in my case, shipping cost more than it would have if I sent it myself via priority mail. (That is not an option, by the way.) Plus, different colors mean different cuts, so they may fit differently.  It's hit or miss. The black one was a miss for me. If you aren't sure, keep in mind that if you don't like it, the shipping cost to return will affect what you get back. In my case, I essentially paid a $7 fee just to try the pants on. Not worth it."
1.0,"I bought this purse, removed all the tags, and the zipper immediately stopped working. One star for utility, one star for the sting of poor timing."
1.0,This blouse runs VERY SMALL.  It is not true to size. Go up at least two sizes for a comfortable fit.
1.0,"my necklace arrive broken :(<br />just go to the 99 cent store for the same type of product, somewhat disapointed, but is it really worth returning??"
1.0,Awful mask. Very thin. No nose bridge. No way to make tighter or looser. If I would‚Äôve have paid $3 for this item it would have been too much but the fact that the vendor charged $16 was highway robbery. I‚Äôm keeping it to avoid the hassle of going back and forth with vendor. My son will wear this over a real mask to display his love for Latvia messaged  on this mask. I don‚Äôt recommend it his mask.
1.0,"super cute bracelet was so excited to have one that finally fits and doesn‚Äôt irritate me, but the band doesn‚Äôt stay tight and constantly loosens causing my watch to fall off my wrist. i could be doing nothing and it will just loosen and fall. extremely disappointed with this order üòû"
1.0,Never recieved the blue jean ones only the white ones. They are way too long and are SEE through SO I probably won't be wearing these EITHER.
1.0,I bought this dress for my<br />Daughter to wear to a wedding. Went to put it on and the zipper was completely busted out. Lots of loose ends and the seams were loose. I realize this dress wasn‚Äôt expensive but it wasn‚Äôt worth the $25 I paid for it either.
1.0,Though the hat is cute it would not fit an adult. I was so sorry since it was going to be a present.
1.0,The dress looks great but it was too big and the fabric felt somewhat coarse and heavy. Returning.
1.0,"Baggy, cheap looking. Very thin."
1.0,"Received a cheap knock off.  Was a beanie not a cap, didn't even go all the way down to my ears and the brim was far smaller.  I was totally disappointed and returned it.  The owner had the label print out almost too big to use on the arrival package and suggested if it was a problem that I pay for the return!"
1.0,This bag is fake
1.0,"very cheaply made, cracks from any touch , thin hard cheap plastic  that might looks good in photos , but very regrettable purchase.<br />can‚Äôt sustain travel"
1.0,This is obviously fake
1.0,Cheap material and no near to what I was expecting.
1.0,I didn't even try this dress on. It was two different colors. The mesh was white and the cotton fabric was cream. I returned it.
1.0,"I use this product to carry items to and from work.  After three weeks the stitching came off the strap that attaches to the hasp, reattached it with fishing wire.  Then a week later the d-ring sewing, which attaches to the hasp, failed.  I would not recommend this product.  Does not seems to be made with quality products."
1.0,Not cute. Not scarf like at all...more like a towel.
1.0,Very thin material. It is see though. It also looks more wide at the bottom then in the pictures. I wouldn‚Äôt order again. Not very flattering.
1.0,You get what you paid for.  Is really good-looking. Did not keep time. The band would not fasten. I returned watch. Is first item I have returned to Amazon. One-star for appearance.
1.0,"Liked the watch while it worked, started loosing time, now it's dead. too short a life for any watch."
1.0,The product was cheap. Wore them once and the whole toe area ripped out. Definitely not satisfied with these products.
1.0,Material wrinkles way too much and easily. Fit is huge. I ordered an XS and it is a huge box on me. Not fitted at all. Returning.
1.0,Cheep Chinese garbage not worth look on it !!! Small size for fat obese mule !!!
1.0,Era como xs
1.0,Runs really great small
1.0,less than a month and it's already broken
1.0,"Scarf looks great and is very soft, HOWEVER, it is shedding all over me and my clothes and my jackets I wear with it.  I trued putting in dryer, I tried washing (even though it says not to wash it) - and nothing has helped, it is still shedding all over.<br />I am very disappointed because I love the way it looks...but cannot have the material all over my clothes, so I am not wearing this anymore.<br />Unfortunately I don't recommend this scarf to anyone"
1.0,"This is a joke, I ordered this item because I was looking for something long, I'm 5'8 and this is what I got;("
1.0,the toes are pointed making the size smaller than expected... I suggest buying half a size bigger to make up for the tight toes
1.0,This thing is huge!  it's like wearing a wall clock on my wrist.
1.0,"This item is extremely poorly made. The patches are sewn on crooked, and the hem is falling off in most places. The color is not as at all as advertised or described. Item is extremely cheaply made and would not recommend to anyone."
1.0,"I order a medium, but I usually wear a small. I am 5 foot five and weigh 130 pounds. The medium was so small I couldn‚Äôt get it on."
1.0,Poor quality printing. Design too low on the shirt and smaller than shown
1.0,I loved the color and was really excited when I got it to find out an extra large size is more like an adult small or medium.
1.0,"way too small - I added a full size as the add said, but I should have added 2 to 3 sizes greater... missed marked badly -"
1.0,Hi<br />I received the product and I found it torn. I have attached one picture and I do not want to find the products so that I will not be shocked if I want to send them to you without incurring the costs. I am present and the option would have been to refund the money.
1.0,It always fell off my head after 2 or 3 hours.  I'm a side sleeper.  My wife said it didn't work either........... probably because it fell off my head.
1.0,"It is misrepresented, I returned it."
1.0,Garbage. Horrible material. Not what the picture shows
1.0,The applicator tip is terrible and the liner goes on thick and cakey.
1.0,made very cheaply. the strap around the band broke the first time i put it on.
1.0,Disappointed! The item has bright green interior and purple straps.
1.0,It doesn't fit  the mk watch. I brought 2 of them and neither one fits.
1.0,"Instead of tapering to the back like the picture shows, it just has a big square cut out of the front of it. It‚Äôs probab the ugliest piece of clothing I‚Äôve ever purchased."
1.0,"These run very large and very wide. Even if you order one size down, the width is a problem. I gave them away. Only recommend if you need super wide slippers."
1.0,This item was broken when it arrived.
1.0,"I bought this wonderful thing just before Halloween last year for Halloween mainly but to also start wearing more often when I got the chance to. Everything went perfectly find on Halloween. Today, I decided to wear it again. This is my SECOND time wearing it  and it's ripping at the bottom. Highly disappointed, honestly."
1.0,After only about a months use the zippers no longer zip up. It's a cute wallet but it won't last long.
1.0,Broke after one month of use.<br /><br />Don't buy.
1.0,Lesson Learned...not all products on Amazon are able to be dropped off at Kohl's. The postage on this $17 purchase would probably be another $17 to return.<br /><br />The sizing is very inaccurate. Will donate to my local Goodwill and write them off our taxes.
1.0,These are made in China and are as wide as they are long
1.0,Extremely saddened‚Äîdead on arrival. No amount of winding I do starts the movement.
1.0,"Zipper so cheaply made, broke after wearing for a few hours.. other than that it looked great. Just glad it only needed to be worn once."
1.0,WAY too big loose everywhere
1.0,"Do not make the same mistake I did and order this because you want linen pants.  First, I'm not sure these ARE linen pants.  Sure, the page says they are, but are they really?  They felt less linen, more synthetic to me.  There was not a label/tag that told me &#34;100% linen&#34; or anything like that.  Also, no care instructions of any kind.  So, I figured that I should wash them and see if that doesn't soften the &#34;linen&#34; up.  Unfortunately, in the gentle cycle of my washing machine, the button fell off.  I'm not a tailor, and I doubt I'm going to take these to have the button sewn back on, so they will likely just be sitting here mocking me."
1.0,A little bit on the frumpy side and not very breathable. Cute for a house dress but wouldn‚Äôt wear in public.
1.0,Fabric was too thick and didn‚Äôt have good stretch to wear when working out.
1.0,"Front seam which, when tried on over underwear, leaves a camel toe."
1.0,"I got this for my mom since we went with my sister and all got our daiths pierced. She absolutely loved the way this looked so I ordered it for her. It wasn't long before the crystals had fallen off which I knew would happen, but the balls themselves ended up disintegrating and we left just the screws showing. We couldn't get it unscrewed once this happened and had to get metal cutters from the tool box and cut it to get it out. :("
1.0,The size XL is more Likee a small no stretch or room. Its  reallly beeauutiful but size is not accurate try to orrder  a sizze or 2 up than whaat you really aare. Just for best recomendation.
1.0,"way too small, material is like spandex too."
1.0,Was missing rhinestones and not what I expected.<br />But customer service was quick to resolve problems.
1.0,"Doesn't secure well,"
1.0,Stitches tore on right sleeve on first try. Left sleeve was ok.
1.0,Don‚Äôt waste your money. And it took too long to arrive
1.0,"I know this is a really good brand and the look and weight are great.  HOWEVER, after wearing these for no more than 20 minutes I had such terrible blisters develop that I can no longer wear them and couldn't wear closed shoes for weeks.  Unfortunately I wore them outdoors so can't return them.  I never write reviews but so frustrated with these.<br /><br />On top of that having a 30 day return policy isn't enough for such a name brand."
1.0,Bought this dress for a wedding. Took a couple months to get so was disappointed it was too small. I am unable to figure out how to return it due to them not giving me a true label to return. I just got some random address from China that UPS can‚Äôt get information on. And the most frustrating part is there is no option to talk to the seller!
1.0,"Bag was pink, not red.  Handle was already ciming apart when it arrived.  Returned."
1.0,the metal piece is not as easy to hook and the jean is way too thick and heavy.
1.0,They don‚Äôt fold properly and they definitely don‚Äôt fit in your pocket
1.0,I order this in a kid size and it is definitely not kid size. It‚Äôs adult size
1.0,Almost put these in the cart and then I noticed they say ‚ÄúKKK‚Äù on the tongue.. seriously Amazon??
1.0,The strap was small
1.0,it was very pretty! i loved it.... but it broke 1 minute after putting on.
1.0,I bought this as a gift for my 8yo granddaughter. The box arrived empty!
1.0,"The jacket isn't at all like the pictures, the quality was cheap and zero shape."
1.0,"Bought 2 pairs of these in different colors and the Khaki was marked with the correct size but was at least 2 sizes smaller than the other pair.  Be very careful when ordering these because you will have to pay for shipping to return, my fault for not reading that in the first place but shipping would have cost me the same amount as I paid for both pairs.  Not worth it to ship back, it will be just like giving them money and not getting the product."
1.0,Super cute for short girls... however tall girls stay away! Way to short and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7!
1.0,Bottoms were too big
1.0,Very very late delivery. Almost a month later that scheduled. Did not have a place to insert the filter that came with it.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:1e0ab29177ec78d8f404b2ca29446080]] My experience with this product unfortunately was not a good one. It literally broke when tried to use it the very first time. I‚Äôm sure everyone‚Äôs experiences are different, but I‚Äôm very dissatisfied and disappointed. So much so, that this is my first ever review."
1.0,"Very cheap product, flimsy.  I wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
1.0,"Only one of the earrings looks good üò°, and the other seems rusted ü§¢, what material is ? Because its not silver,  looks like some cheap metal, I think it's a scam, I feel terrible now that i open it,  I have no choice but to use it , bcause i live in the other part of the planet üò≠, You should not play with people's expectations for a few coins, what a disappointment üëé"
1.0,"way too small, felt more like more 2 like me like a med like a xl. not going to buy again"
1.0,"Cheap material, damaged"
1.0,"wayy to small, and stitching is completely uneven making this shirt look lopsded and ridiculous."
1.0,"It make both me & my daughter look pregnant, flimsy material. Not worth the price."
1.0,Says its for men. So I bought a small for my 9 year old boy. Nope !! Too small.
1.0,Fit a child
1.0,The product looks very nice but the material is scratchy and uncomfortable it has no stretch and is definitely not worth the price
1.0,Way too short does not fit n any way dont waste ur money
1.0,"this bracelet reminds me of my childhood play jewlery .<br />If this is 55% off , it must be April Fools Day. It looks very cheap , not at all like sterling silver as advertised. I donated it to a womens group that helps the poor dress for job interviews so perhaps some one out there is happy with it . Lesson Learned ~ If something looks priced to good to be true, at a discount larger than the price , Think Twice !"
1.0,No size was so off
1.0,One of the earrings was off the post
1.0,"They lasted 1 week and the broke, not good quality."
1.0,"I didn't expect top quality since I only paid $6, but this produce is still over priced.  The hat won't even stand up right, very thin and flimsy.  I had to insert cardboard to give it shape.  Would not recommend this product."
1.0,"Way too small, not stretchy at all and barely came past my knee. Color was also way off, looked like brown in person."
1.0,"Before you purchase this ring look at the second photo! While not a bad ring, it is not the one from the main picture. If I had looked at the second picture I would not have bought this ring."
1.0,"I ordered according to the recommended, and it was as if I had on a regular tank top. The fit was good, but there was no compression at all.  Disappointing"
1.0,I figured the one shown would be plastic. Anyone looking for an authentic one with actual metal casing you can order them on www.thinkgeek.com for $50
1.0,Basically looks like the picture but if you purposely  left it out in direct sunlight for 40 days
1.0,"*** UPDATE*****BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE<br />purchased for great niece for birthday/Christmas gift.<br /> these boots are absolute garbage. they ripped like a piece of paper the first time she put on.  Look at picture. My niece is 4 yrs. old and we bought boot a size larger so she could grow into. It was almost 2 months since time we bought for Christmas gift and gave to her. We contacted seller and was give run around and told to look at refund policy. Only policy was from amazon's 3rd party seller.  We sent picture to seller as requested and was given more excuses. it is currently February 21st, 2020 and we are still trying to get refund and resolution to matter. We talked with Amazon CS and have submitted and A to Z guarantee request and have been declined. we are currently in the appeal process. We have already purchased a higher quality, better made boot for her.  We would have expected that either the 3rd party seller or amazon would want to correct this mater even thought it was about 2 months from purchase to when we gave as gift. (we left boots in original box and wrapped them in it.) would understand people will purchase item early for Christmas due to high demands and for items that are popular for kids. I will NEVER EVER purchase from this seller and will continue to inform every person a talk to about these boots to do the same. In my opinion, amazon should remove this seller and other sellers that sell very low quality products. These sellers directly affect consumers‚Äô confidence and reputation of Amazon.  WE will continue to work with all parties involved to come to a agreeable resolution to this matter and will continue to purchase from amazon, but with a lot more caution when looking at purchasing products."
1.0,"I bought these sunglasses in April and two lenses have already fallen out; the left front lens and the right side lens. They were great until the lenses fell out. Very disappointed! I expected them to last a little longer than 2 months!  I'm downgrading my 3 stars (because I was pleased with the service just not the product) to a one star, because I didn't receive any response about the poor quality of the sunglasses. My husband and I have been a customer since 2007 and have always been happy with the service I have received, but not this time! Before I purchased the sunglasses, I missed the reviews from other customers with the same complaint about the product. I would not recommend these sunglasses.<br /><br />07/22/2021: This is my second complaint and I am very displeased that I never received a response about the poor quality of the sunglasses I purchased. I had them 2 months and 2 lenses fell out, and although it was past the return date 04/12/2021, the sunglasses were of poor quality and I would like to receive credit for the purchase. A response would be very much appreciated!"
1.0,The gem looks like a cloudy piece of plastic.
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy very poorly made.
1.0,These were absolutely awful! Completely see-through and flimsy. Elastic already seemed stretched out. Unbelievable. Terrible quality
1.0,The mask is HUGE! My husband who is a larger size man couldn't even fit in it on the tightest fasten. Huge rip off! Plus it said you could return it and they don't accept returns. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!
1.0,Bought this and it broke as soon as I tried wearing it.
1.0,I absolutely loved the way this swimsuit looked! I only got to wear it twice and the clamps for the top snapped off!! Luckily I wasn't around anyone at the time it broke because everyone would have had a show. LOL. My top is pretty average size so I would have to say there isn't much support and cheap hard ware.
1.0,This item host sharp edges that immediately dig into your forehead.  No bueno.
1.0,It was cut on the bottom of the ring. It was sooo pretty though. I returned for a refund. I may try getting another one in hopes it is not cut.
1.0,Wow never Again
1.0,I had bought this for my boyfriend as a silly gift and he loved the idea. Problem was when it arrived the tail wasn't even attached to the hat and the entire thing looked liked it was just shoved into the box it was shipped it. I ended up sending it back.
1.0,The waist ran very small.
1.0,I ordered this skirt a size bigger expecting it to fit and it did not!! The shirt would not even zip up when I had it high up my waist. I was very displeased. The look and material are great just the sizing is so incorrect. I would not buy unless you are very very skinny.
1.0,"I fiber from the inside stick to your skin when the skin is wet, the chain is very bad."
1.0,Size too small. If you order an XL it will be a Medium.
1.0,This watch band is not as described! It is smaller than 22mm and will not fit Samsung Gear watches.
1.0,My Husband loved the boots but he was sent a used pair instead of new!
1.0,"The hoodie is scratchy to wear. It's hand wash or dry clean only. This is not stated in the description. I tried to return it. This is an Amazon Prime with free return purchase, but the seller is charging a fee to return it. Not happy. I do not recommend purchasing from this seller."
1.0,I found this fabric to be itchy - do not think the content is listed correctly as acrylic and polyester do not make me itch  - a wool or wool blend makes me itch.
1.0,One of the charms arrived broken. It's disheartening to say the least!
1.0,"The shoulder stayed in a peak because of the type of fabric.  The satin is thick and of cheap quality.<br />The size might be wrong too, because I always get Small, but this one fits too tight as you can see on the picture.<br />Returning with no intentions of trying any more sizes."
1.0,"The size runs small and the socks were different colors, not like the picture"
1.0,El estampado es diferente al que aparece en la imagen... decepcionante
1.0,Cheap looking.  Sold in yard sale.
1.0,horrible lousy material also
1.0,"The picture makes you believe you will receive a cute, classy dress... NOT TRUE AT ALL.  It literally looks like a cardboard box on.  Such a waste of money."
1.0,This is NOT a rain jacket. It is not waterproof at all.
1.0,looked great....but stopped working after a week...the second hand fell off
1.0,ü§Æü§Æ
1.0,I would not say it is small. Just a CHEAP quality. Fabric is horrible and seams fell apart after the first wear. If I had opportunity to return it I would do so. But now is too late. Save your money and don't waste for such product. 30 $ sent directly to a trash bin ; (
1.0,It is not worth the price. Necklace is made out of plastic. Seller needs to provide this information to buyer.
1.0,"Absolutely NOT what was advertised!!! The mask sheds glitter, the stitching is not clean as the sequins are flipped the wrong way on the edges. There are gaps between the sequins where the grey backing is showing through. It just seems dull and not as fabulous as the images. Not what was pictured!  I might send it back."
1.0,Product did not work any better than regular dish soap! Be ready to pick up all the loose bristles from the brush---extremely frustrating to have loose bristle to clean up as well.
1.0,Way too big thought I ordered curtains instead of a tee. Weird fabric too.
1.0,It's ugly and cheap!
1.0,I bought these for my daughter.  She wore them less than a month and the stone came out.  Very disappointing...Do NOT buy
1.0,I wear a size 14 shoe and these are too large. They are especially loose around the heel and ankle. This is disappointing considering I bought another style of this brand and love them.
1.0,The connector for the nail cutter already came off after 2 weeks of use. not a good quality
1.0,It does not fit an adult. It‚Äôs more fit for a toddler
1.0,Its not clraning anything. You can just use this for brush your nubuk products. Dont waste your money for that.
1.0,"its cute, but your finger will change colors and the little jewels fall out super easy. Its a sometime ring only."
1.0,"Too small, waistline is at the top of the ribs, material is ridiculously thin. Do not waste your time, money or energy."
1.0,Too long. The dress fabric is synthetic and not great for warm weather. The color and pattern do match the picture but the cut does not. No free re turns. It falls closed and looks more like a church dress than a sexy dress.
1.0,The hands stopped working after 2days
1.0,Thin ring... I got what I paid for a 9.00 ring.  Will invest more next time.
1.0,Awful fit. If you order add 2 sizes up
1.0,2XL still too small
1.0,My daughter has been dying for a choker so we took a chance and ordered this one.  It is a cheap low quality choker necklace that doesn't fit!
1.0,This fit oddly; how could something be too big and too small at the same time? Fabric is cheesy. Made me look pregnant.
1.0,Could not remove links to make it smaller.
1.0,Turns toes green.
1.0,"Too big, poor quality."
1.0,"VERY DISAPPOINTING!! Bought this as a birthday GIFT for my niece. She loved it! Was going to wear it to school on the day she got it. It broke before she got out the door! It was supposed to be an exciting addition to her birthday celebration. It broke minutes after she took out of the box. The box was simple but nice enough to present without additional wrapping. She loved the look of the necklace, but the quality was poor."
1.0,"The photographs say it all.  Arrived in a used looking condition, with chunks of missing wax and the rest crumbly and cracked."
1.0,"Color and size are not accurate, do NOT recommend ."
1.0,Ran very small and they gave me a hard  time about getting a refund.
1.0,Stopped working after 3 days...
1.0,Awful broke in two days
1.0,This bra has no support at all
1.0,Way too large. Doesn't even closely fit on tightest button. Waste of money.
1.0,Ok so I figured it would be small(er) so I ordered a size up...the XL fit my 6 year old daughter and she is a 7/8 in kids. Don't waste your time unless you normally wear a S you can upsize to the XL for it to fit like the model.
1.0,Very think and uncomfortable
1.0,No me aparece para elegir la talla
1.0,Terrible liner.  No support what so ever and the material is cheap and rough.
1.0,These are dress socks...not 100% cotton socks. I bought in bulk and very disappointed.
1.0,Said small but came large my daughter was very unhappy
1.0,Could be cute if the straps weren‚Äôt so long that the fabric ends around my waist
1.0,"I ordered XL - I am shoe size 12.  My Home Health Aide could not even get the sock over my big toe!  (made in China - maybe that's the problem?).  They sat in the corner and I forgot about them, now it's past the Return date and the company shows their greed by not even meeting me halfway?  I'll never buy this brand again and i'll tell others not to."
1.0,Too small than normal size.
1.0,As much as I wanted to like the mask they were so thin and too big for kids. Plus shipped late.
1.0,Bought this sandal for my daughter to wear on vacation she wear it once and about an hour later it burst had to spend money to buy another one its no good i only give one star because it look good otherwise is money lost never to get back
1.0,"I ordered the black/white/grey stripped dress, but what I recieved was not a dress, it was a box! An awkward length box dress, with huge ill-fitting sleeves. And when I returned it I HAD TO PAY FOR THE RETURN POSTAGE."
1.0,Very poor quality. Feels like polyester and plastic. It‚Äôs also see through
1.0,The suit is very bad. The seller deceives the people. I have not bought such a bad product for a long time. The money is gone. Bad commodity.
1.0,"I did not receive what is pictured, I got a huge pendant in a bag with a chain that doesn‚Äôt look like the one pictured at all. This says dainty but it looks like it‚Äôs for a guy instead of a girl. Very disappointed."
1.0,I did not care for it. Too thin and no shape and unappealing.
1.0,The heels seemed to be crooked and stick out longer than the toe making it impossible to walk in.
1.0,"Poor quality material and not true to size (bust size way too small and sleeves also small).  Also description color pink, but it is peach color."
1.0,"Loved the vibrant colors, but that's about it. The dress is not made for someone with a little it if a broad shoulder. My size 40c cups barely fit in the top part too. Also the material is super super thin, which would be fine if it didn't rip so easily. Tried it on out of the bag, insert my hands in the pockets as we do ya know & immediately the right pocket ripped off the dress. Because the thinnes of the material the dress rippled too. Very disappointed so I returned it."
1.0,When I ordered these gloves out of the motorcycle section There was not this girl wearing fur. These were advertised as motorcycle riding gloves. When they arrived in a nice pretty  girly box with a gold bow I knew they were not what I was expecting  .Maybe useful for wearing around the house but not for motorcycles
1.0,color is not the same as if shows online. coats is very cute but has to run small because i am 5 foot 1 and 104lbs. and i can not move my arms forward or outward to the side and sleeves from shoulder to the wrist are so tight you could not even wear a long sleeve shirt and i ordered a small. the seller should replace it with next size up at no extra cost because it does not run big that is misleading on the sizing description. Why did it take a over a month for a response on the disappointment of the coat sizing being wrong and no response about replacement in a bigger size so I had to return it. your response is wanting me to write a better review.
1.0,Had to return it. It was so ugly and like an old lady dress. The reviews were so good on it I thought maybe it would be cute. It was comfy but I am not ready to dress like an old lady. I wear a small and I am 40 years old. I tend to wear trendy clothes.
1.0,"I SENT THIS PRODUCT RIGHT BACK. THE BOOTS WERE BEAUTIFUL AND I REALLY WANTED TO ENJOY THEM. THE FISHY ODOR WAS TOO HORRIFIC AND THE ODOR GOT ON MY SKIN AFTER I TRIED THEM ON. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THEM, BUT THE ODOR WAS TERRIBLE."
1.0,El m√≠o es carnibal no fue lo que esperaba para el costo
1.0,Don‚Äôt fit my 0 or 8mm gage size eat lobes
1.0,"The buttons were off centered, the scarf does not fit around properly, and the dress is transparent (bought a different scarf to wear)"
1.0,I liked the colors of the frames but the lens isn't clear. Looking through them was like looking through fog. They also distorted whatever I was looking at.
1.0,"Instructions were terrible unclear, never got to use."
1.0,Poor quality ripped in a day
1.0,The order came with 2 bands.  They are mate finish not bright finish as the original.  The worst problem is that they are not a perfect fit.  The pin fits too tight in the band holes.  I was able to install it but only after cutting some of the end part of the band to make it smaller.  I sort of damaged the pins and the holes when trying to install it.  I needed to use the special tool with V shaped end to be able to fit the pins in the holes. I do not recommend this product.
1.0,I'm 5ft 6&#34; & it barely hit my waste.  A wrinkled mess.  Cheap product.  I gave it to my 10 year old.  A 1/2 a step above the old yellow poncho.  4 stars no way.  PASS!
1.0,These were so cute but broke within first week... sad because I gave them as a gift... they are really fragile... wish I could still get a refund
1.0,Started changing colors and it always slide off ma head
1.0,Within a year this watch ran out of order. Simply doesn't work.
1.0,Looks and feels cheap.  it's too small. I can't return it because there was no return documents in the package.<br />I was VERY Disappointed!!!
1.0,"These cheaply made gloves fell apart after three wearings! Avoid buying these as they are portrayed as high-end gloves with a fancy box and all, but are just really junk!"
1.0,Deffinently not what I ordered. Item looks nothing like the picture advertised. Very poor quality
1.0,Way too big for an average size woman's head.
1.0,I don‚Äôt remember a place to specify the size when I placed the order. It was not what I expected.  I‚Äôm not returning it and will just give to someone who has larger feet.
1.0,its malfunctioning after only 2weeks of use
1.0,Not very pleased when I got these. There are scuffs and scratches and some imperfections from casting on them. The tie clip has the worst damage. I won't be ordering from them again.
1.0,"Noted to be 95% cotton; it arrives and its 65% POLYESTER - once complaint filed with Amazon, the SELLER then sends a message saying/hoping they will refund you 40% and you can keep it?????"
1.0,Looks good and sorry it was too small
1.0,I bought. 2 of these and another one  that is similar ---and I am unable to open ANY of the clasps! It looks like they are welded shut or something. Beautiful necklaces but no good if I cannot wear them.
1.0,"This just firs weird. Idk if my chest is too big or what, but everything hangs out. Like, bad. And I'm not a big girl lol"
1.0,"This came today ahead of time. But I had to look at my order to see what it was.  This not anyway near what the picture and description say it is at all.  It just a large tee shirt with not sharp or form to it  at all.  You could look at it know one wash and it will shrink...really false advertisement. Just order the real deal from Lamo women's tunic top I will just pay the $15  and stop being cheap, cause that what I got with this top."
1.0,Cheap..cheap  cheap
1.0,No chain arrived with this pendant and the disc was not attached as pictured in the description. I will now have to find and attachment hook and new chain to be able to enjoy this product.:-(
1.0,"no support at all, super flimsy"
1.0,Waste of money charm fell off somewhere.  I want my money back.
1.0,"Very thin material, you can see right through it. Very short in the torso.  Returning it."
1.0,"These glasses were super cute. I had one pair that broke after less than a year, so I ordered the same pair o continue using my lenses. Less than a year later, the second pair broke too. The little gold piece fell out in both pairs on the same side and the glasses no longer stay on my face."
1.0,Son muy peque√±os.. en la foto se aprecian m√°s grandes y tienen algunos huecos vacios de zirconias y no abrochan bien estan flojos
1.0,"THE GLASSES DONT LOOK LIKE THEY DO IN THE PICTURE , VERY CHEAP THE GLASS PART WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR WITH A YELLOW HUE SO UGLY I THREW THEM OUT WAIST OF MONEY"
1.0,Don't be fooled this is not ortho foot they are trying to fool you by using a similar name . they're quality is not half as good
1.0,Cannot be used for Covid protection as it is only single layer cloth.
1.0,It cracked after two days of wearing
1.0,They turnd my skin green and broke apart. Its not worth buying them
1.0,The light only worked for one day. My daughter was disappointed.
1.0,"As soon as I put it on, it broke. I was able to pry it and get it on another link but a little disappointed in this product. But for the price I can't really complain."
1.0,"This band is much less snug than the one that comes with the go-tcha, I'm not trusting my device to this one."
1.0,"Very disappointing, these didn't even last for one use. One finger in the right glove split open. Very big and clumsy. It was difficult to handle more delicate glassware."
1.0,"Junk! Iron on patch. Delivered in envelope from China. If you don't like it, tuff! You can figure it out... I'm stuck with a junk yard mowing cap!"
1.0,Got his for my Grandson (16); it MIGHT have fit him when he was 3. So much for the idea of buying Christmas presents early! Converted it from stocking-stuffer to trash-can stuffer.
1.0,Today I wore this bracelet. I was upset when I got home took the bracelet off and my risk had a black ring around it. Buyer beware. Should have known. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"It‚Äôs a cute top, but made really small. I have small arms and this was even tight on mine. It‚Äôs also shorter than it should be, and very thin material."
1.0,Order arrived yesterday. My son wore them today for the first time at the pool. They are already coming apart from not even an hour of wearing them. I purchased these for an upcoming trip. I am not sure they are even going to hold up during our trip. Very disappointed.
1.0,very shinny. Looks cheap.
1.0,not much to it. glad i didnt pay anymore for it.
1.0,"not soft, very clunky shoes.  Would not recommend.  I returned my purchase"
1.0,This is such a joke. It's way too small. I ordered the largest size and it's meant for someone who is like a extra large. Don't buy this item if you actually want to wear it. I want a refund. üò°
1.0,"The product faulty, it cracked after 4 days.I reordered a replacement arrived damaged. Therefore, I would like a refund."
1.0,Not at all what I was expecting.  It feels like plastic finished to look like a stainless steel bracelet.  I can deny the &#34;links&#34; with my fingernail.  I definitely would not recommend this item.
1.0,I‚Äôm very unhappy with the stitching on these pants!!! I put it in this am and the pocket stitch unstitched... then during the day the leg pocket unstitched... Seriously?!?! 1 day of use...
1.0,"I was super excited to get this bathing suit because its so cute. However after trying it on, this offers absolutely 0 support in the chest area. I wasnt expecting it to hold my girls tight and firm but i mean. This was a hot mess. This was a major let down. If your boobs arent naturally perky, i wouldnt bother with this. Its also tight on the bum so anyone with a large behind should beware too. Otherwise this would hypothetically look good on someone small and average."
1.0,When was working and when was dead
1.0,The little gold turtle broke off of the ring. It started tarnishing 2 days after I got it. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Wouldn't recommend buying this if you're looking for a sweatshirt. Really thin material. Not a sweatshirt, more like a long sleeve t-shirt."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:5c6d5ebd58e697c89185c2a32ebe3d4d]] Disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />The floral print and the stitching is beautiful, it gives that ruffle look as it goes down the skirt which I‚Äôve been looking for.<br /><br />The material is cheap however; not stretchy at all and couldn‚Äôt fit the top piece. The skirt is a wrap around with the long tie. This wouldn‚Äôt stay secure at all. The material feel so light and plastic-y.<br /><br />Definitely not worth the $35+ purchase. Save yourself the time and money."
1.0,Wouldn't recommend the post were all bent when we received them.
1.0,No trae los colores de la publicidad... Y el color blanco estaba da√±ado y manchado. Y no trae la maya multicolor. No estoy satisfecha.
1.0,Description wasnt accurate on the sizing
1.0,Sizing wayyy off
1.0,The print on the dress is pixelated. Don‚Äôt buy!
1.0,This arrived to me damaged. I would not buy this again.
1.0,"I gave this item a 1 star because what I purchase vs what I got is not what I expected. The dress is not true to size I am a small the dress was too small, it's too short for me and it's cheaply made."
1.0,It looks nothing like picture and looks way too small so disappointed at this product.
1.0,The band is narrower than the original.
1.0,"I was excited to purchase this bag. It was just what I needed for work and for travel. Unfortunately, when it arrived the front inside pocket clearly was glued together and when it reached me it was coming apart. I don't normally write bad reviews it I was not happy at all!  I returned it the same day."
1.0,The ones the dollar store sells are better than these
1.0,Super weird cut
1.0,"Ordered two different pair, both large.  One shirt for perfectly, the other was way too small!"
1.0,"Unless it got damaged during shipping, I was not able to use the gravity claw, which was main reason I purchased it. It seemed like the connecting parts were very tight not giving me the option to use that."
1.0,Made cheap white thread shows all over the pants as if the pants are busting at all the seams .. the only nice thing is the length and the nice fit and the thickness I wish I didn‚Äôt need to return them but not even worth keeping üòû
1.0,"Product looked nice in pictures but definitely cheap material and was already coming apart once I opened. The shoulder straps just kept falling off my daughter, probably could have gone down a size or two."
1.0,stone was missing
1.0,Horrible product ...not bendable<br />It would be a Zero star but that is not an option
1.0,"Returning. Awful quality, poorly sewn, strings hanging out all I‚Äôve the place. Cheap material, I wouldn‚Äôt give it a week of holding up to any use. TINY. Like this would be a good size for my 5 year old niece."
1.0,"Umm, the lime green was supposed to be a XXL (notice the length in the other 3 leggings to the left that were part of the same order but they were XXXL).<br /><br />Clearly something is off with the lime green men ones that will be going back."
1.0,"Low quality item, had to cut holes on the eyes for better visibility amd to breathe better, if you decide to make the same dumb decision like me, to buy it, before you put it on wipe it clean, because it started to itch my face."
1.0,"The stitching was off and not a straight seam. That gave the coat a twisted irregular fit at the collar, lapel  and down the left side. It also feels more like a bathrobe. I will be returning this item."
1.0,"After just a few wears, the covering wouldn't stay up on my daughter's face. I'm disappointed in this purchase."
1.0,Expect the ordered size to be too small based on US standards. I ordered an 2XL and it fits like a large.
1.0,They charged way way way way way too much for these and I feel like they took advantage of me
1.0,Cheapest thing ever. Could have made it myself for 50 cents or less.
1.0,This product is severely fragile
1.0,Very difficult product to use. The mold did not take the shape of the tooth. Waste of an hour of my life trying to get one tooth mold to resemble a tooth. Do not buy.
1.0,The pants are not limited to ng enough. The drawstring is too thin in the pants. The description is not correct.
1.0,Seriously. These are a joke. First off...the strings are barely 12 inches long on each side. So plus size can‚Äôt wear them at all. I couldn‚Äôt even tie them. And second the pockets in the front are a joke. You can‚Äôt even fit a servers book in them. Not a good buy at all
1.0,The underwires poke out and dig into my arms. I‚Äôll never wear them.
1.0,"We received it and upon opening it, realized it was slightly damp and smelled strongly of mildew. Disgusting!"
1.0,I'm revising my previous review.  I got these socks for my husband for Christmas since he loved the old Wigwam socks so much.  These are NOT improved.  It is now March and they are all stretched out.  They are not as cushioned as the old socks and have held up badly to say the least.  I found the old version on another website and bought a bunch.  I will not make the mistake of buying this version again.
1.0,Tore the first day in the gym. Didn‚Äôt even wash them first. Had a nice fit and feel but couldn‚Äôt stand up to 1 workout. Would not recommend.
1.0,This is very poor quality I never met!<br />I got this just before we head to ski and glad to received just the right time.<br />After first ride of ski most sew line started to broke off.  After half day ride of ski all insulate and liner came out completed from broken sew lines.  It was turn my day to be cool hand day and have to go to buy another pair of glove.
1.0,"I got only 50 something rings from the supposed 110 rings. The ones i did get, most were crap"
1.0,Has awful chemical stinky smell to them.  Returned them.  Who knows what chemical or substance the smell was from!
1.0,They were smaller than expected and when you wash them they shrink up and look like half shirts.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt even get to wear it!
1.0,"I like the bracelet, however the sizing is way too big so I cant even enjoy wearing it."
1.0,"Was a gift to a friend, fixing to do a return, doesn't fit at all, xl  fits like large."
1.0,"These were adorable in photos. The fit was too large since thd child had to wear a tank underneath for modesty..top doesn't cover enough of chedt area.<br />Neither was stitched appropriately, see photos. Disappointedly, I am returning both.."
1.0,Fits small and it was not the same color as the picture. Order a rose gold and got a maroon/red dress and it was for my bridal shower thanks for not getting me the right things I paid for.
1.0,"El material no es adecuado, se va fragmentado. Me fui a poner los lentes y empez√≥ a fragmentar se, fui a solicitar el cambio nuevamente porque las primeras que solicit√© llegaron partidas"
1.0,It's not worth the price.  Junk.
1.0,This is poorly made - the plug broke off in my phone the first time I put it in and I had a hard time getting the plastic piece out of my phone.  The bear is also much larger than it looks.
1.0,"There's no way these are real.  Terrible fit, not real rag & bone hence, the cheap price."
1.0,I have other colors in this brand that I like alot.  The white however shows everything.  Very see-thru<br />You would have to wear a long tunic top to cover up.
1.0,They are very big on your nose and the magnet's are very very small and could possibly get stuck up your nose so be aware of that.
1.0,Bummed with these shoes. They were so small. I ordered a size 10 and they fit like a 9.
1.0,"Item sells itself as a gift, yet does not allow you to send as a gift. You cannot include a message or receipt for them to exchange or return. I don't know the recipient's size. Probably wouldn't matter anyway because there's no size guide. How many inches for the waist is a size XLG?? It's a secret. Who is fulfilling or shipping this product? That's also a secret! After I purchased I contacted Lands End to find out how the receiver can exchange or return and they tell me they can't do anything about it because it's fulfilled by Amazon. ""Lands End is unable to process a return or exchange for items purchased on Amazon,"" but they're happy to let me buy another one in the right size! I bought the ""Aqua Breeze Dogs and Cats."" There are no Cats. Shoddy listing. No help. They don't care. This was supposed to be a fun gag gift. I would never spend $10 on a single pair of underwear otherwise. Very disappointed in this experience.üòïüòî"
1.0,Fabric was too sheer
1.0,Too delicate for my needs.  Returned item
1.0,"When I ordered I did not realize these were coming from Asia, otherwise I would not have ordered.  Sized way up and they are still somewhat small and took over a month to arrive."
1.0,The band we received did not have a quick release as advertised!!!
1.0,Band entirely too small for my wrist.  Looks like it was made for a child.
1.0,I got the XL and there's no way that fits ANYONE XL 10/10 would not recommend
1.0,not as advertised .I was not able to put them on because  they  were not large enough.
1.0,"After trying the shirt on, it torn right away in the chest area."
1.0,"I purchased these because they actually looked like nice, simple kippot from the pictures on-line. Unfortunately, I now have three yarmulkes that can be used as bowls to eat ice cream, not as actual yarmulkes. The stitching is extremely tight and none of these lie flat on your head, unless you're 5 years old. My recommendation, as much as I hate to be the one to break this to you, is to not purchase these yarmulkes and to keep on searching."
1.0,"Completely disintegrated within 3 hours. I guess I rented it for $1 an hour! I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but I thought I could wear it at least a couple of times before it turned green.  Nope. Totally fell apart into multiple pieces."
1.0,"Shaped strange, not like I expected"
1.0,Pants are short... High waters
1.0,Not as pictured at all. And it is not a lobster clasp as as shown in the picture. It is a lousy ring clasp and very thin chain. And even the ring clasp doesn't fit well. Save your money. Back it goes.
1.0,Says it‚Äôs small but it‚Äôs large and doesn‚Äôt fit the watch. Unable to post the picture here.
1.0,"I returned these because I didn't get multiple colors. Instead I got 3 cream, 2 blacks, then 1 mustard, 1 pale pink & 1 taupe."
1.0,"Gross heavy shiny fabric. Seams were out of line. Terrible. Would have returned, but missed the deadline."
1.0,The product is way too small and completely see-through.
1.0,This was a reorder because I Loved the original glasses.  The glasses on this reorder were not the strength I ordered even though that is what they were marked.  Disappointed!!
1.0,"Don‚Äôt waste your money ! Not even 2 months in, all of the hooks started to break. 6 months later and I‚Äôm down to 3 hooks! Made of flimsy plastic"
1.0,Two of four socks had a hole in the heel before ever trying them on!  Obviously returning.
1.0,This does not stay tight on your wrist because it keeps slipping open so it's always loose. The very 1st time I wore it the little charm fell off. I'm giving 1 star only because it is a very nice looking bracelet. I will have to find a way to keep it tighter on my wrist so I don't lose it if I wanna continue to wear it.
1.0,Such a disappointment if you don't have tiny ears. I have normal size ears and every pair were way to short. I actually ordered a 2nd set thinking it was a fluke but nope they are all to short. They fit my 7 year old granddaughter. So If you have tiny ears go for it because they are really cute but if you have average ears don't waste your time.
1.0,These were much too small for my 10 year old daughter and my 8 year old found them too uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 mins.
1.0,Shirts are larger than normal. I always wear a medium and thsi seems like its a large. Customer service sucks. Buyer beware.
1.0,The fabric is see-thru on white dress. Had to return
1.0,If you have a stomach this is not for you. I order a 2x to cover the stomach. I looked like a fat baby in a onesie üò©
1.0,"Calidad pesima del producto, todas se pelaron, como pueden vender articulos que no sirven"
1.0,DO NOT ORDER<br />WATCH WAS BROKEN WHEN I GOT IT
1.0,"I bought a small, which is more like an extra large."
1.0,"Not as described, colors were way off, the design was way off and I got sent right back. Skip this option save the money."
1.0,This product runs small. I wear an XL but this XL fits like a US Medium. Way too small.  No paperwork was included for a return.
1.0,I always wear DMs since high school and they are great and lasted 8-10 years...<br />But my recent purchase of DMs are so bad<br />I worked on a warehouse and after wearing it for 3 1/2 months the sole just cracked...<br />So disappointed<br />Its slippery too...<br />I hope they make DMs quality just like they where back in the 90s...
1.0,"Would not purchase again, there were no beads, looked like a red shoelace. I did return the 2 I got."
1.0,Shiny and slinky. Who lounges in shiny fabric?  I returned it immediately
1.0,Had to return it didn‚Äôt like the material or the fit.
1.0,"this a cheap imitation not even close to a native American workmanship. product made in Indonesia......will return to Indonesia . what a fraud,,,,,,,"
1.0,I dont have one Month with it and its broken.
1.0,Too large... Cheap looking... Returning
1.0,This piece is NOT snug to your face. It‚Äôs huge. If you‚Äôre stuffing it as a decoration then it‚Äôs great.
1.0,Very pretty. I put them in & went to bed. Woke up with horrible earlobe hurting. My earlobes were infected & bleeding.
1.0,broke soon after brought got more than 1 all fell apart  in no time they are not worth giving away<br />brought some in dollar tree lasted alot longer
1.0,To start... my package came about 2 months late. These pants don‚Äôt even look ‚Äústacked‚Äù or thicker on the ends. They were HUGE on me and I went by the sizing chart. Do not recommend at all. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,"Sleeves are off, not able to accurately use thumb holes."
1.0,"1) Cotton 45%, Poly 55%<br />2) No machine wash<br />3) No small pocket for mobile phone<br />4) I bought S size, but head on this hood is like on XL sizes<br /><br />Don't buy this."
1.0,"very thin and bad quality, color not as pictured, has no shape no fit stretches out very easily and comes loose, not fitted at all as i hoped, i returned this"
1.0,The dress is cute but it had an awful smell.
1.0,"My boyfriend bought me this choker after I was showing him different things I wanted for Christmas. This is NOT worth the money, as it is made of cheap fabric. The inside lining is uncomfortable and leaves a red ring around my neck when I wear it. As for the &#34;gems&#34; they are little red pieces of PLASTIC, and the chain connecting them to the bite mark symbols is made of thin metal. This chain is easily breakable because of the cheap, thin metal it is made of. It may look &#34;Oh-so-soft&#34; on this picture, but I guarantee that it is NOT what the description says it is. You could make your own, more comfortable, better-looking one as a DIY project and it would last much longer. This is fitting for Halloween, but NOT everyday wear. I suggest you don't buy it and get a different choker for every day use, and not buy this one, as that is FAR too expensive for a Halloween item. I definitely will NOT be buying products from this seller again."
1.0,They are cheap and won‚Äôt snap closed.
1.0,"I would hardly call these high waisted. Feel like jeans and the waist has stretch, but the waist is super low. Would not recommend if you‚Äôre curvy or got a booty!"
1.0,"I COULD NOT OPEN THE CLASP WITH MY FINGERS.  IF I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO OPEN IT WITH A PAIR OF PLIERS I WOULD HAVE, BUT THEN I WILL HAVE IT FOREVER HANGING ON MY NECK AS IT WON'T BE TAKEN OFF WITHOUT BRUISING MY NECK."
1.0,Fell apart within 1 month
1.0,"These shorts are super unflattering and they are cut crazy.  They are too long to be cheeky at all,  they are cut and stitched uneven. If they didn't look so terrible on,  I would provide a picture to show what I'm talking about.  They are not flattering at all at all."
1.0,"I normally order from Fabletics or PopFit, but these were a great deal so decided to give them a go. Sadly I am disappointed.  They are much too small and the waist always rolls down, making them super uncomfortable. I wish I could return them but I threw away the package. Id even try a larger pair, but I don't think they have 2xl. Super sad."
1.0,DO NOT BOTHER PURCHASING PEOPLE !<br />You are better buying it off at the dollar store honestly . This is super cheap material!<br />I‚Äôm upset I spent almost 20 on this bull crap
1.0,Poorly design and made. The hat was stitched uneven
1.0,Was way to small ordered an XL
1.0,I am really really disappointed. The sizing is all wrong. The 30 x30 is bigger than the 32 x30 so I‚Äôm really not happy with these new jeans. Can someone help me please? These jeans are falling off me!
1.0,Product was not rhinestone incrusted as shown on picture very unsatisfied false advertising!
1.0,"My husband wears a size 13 shoe. I bought these for a Roaring 20's New Year's Eve party we were attending. When he started to put them on, he realized they would not fasten around his ankles. He ended up not wearing them."
1.0,Not. These are stretch gloves with grips. Don‚Äôt work at all.
1.0,Mask won‚Äôt switch speed‚Äôs and stays on can‚Äôt turn it off
1.0,Good idea and maybe this works for some folks but these didn't work for me at all. I put them in my shoes like instructed and my toes ended up feeling smushed and uncomfortable in  my shoes.
1.0,Not Tahitian black pearls.  Turned out to be magnetic?????  They are a choker not 18‚Äù.  Also more like 5-6mm.  But what would one expect for $8.98.
1.0,"Not at all like the description. Small, ‚Äòpaint-chips‚Äô that are not worth the money.<br />Very disappointing."
1.0,"Feel so sad to have open this to wrap it for my daughters birthday and it was broken! Of course I'm trying to replace it or return it and it shows is not eligible for return! Now I feel so disappointed that my father won't have this for her birthday!<br />Also, it does not even have the hair clips!! I received some emoji stickers instead.<br />Do not buy this!"
1.0,fell apart awful quality took ages to get to states from china
1.0,Product was not as described and support at the company was beyond unhelpful. Says it can be personified but there is no way to have it done. I will not buy from this particular company again. Shirt was overpriced and not worth what I paid for it.
1.0,"15 minutes into the first use, one strap's glue gave away. I used it on my child's glasses, so didn't stretch much. Very disappointed. Don't even feel like trying the others in the pack. And to top it, it cannot be returned. I'd suggest, stay away."
1.0,"I purchased this product and when washed in warm water it shrank. It already fit snug but now its too small for comfort. I started a return and was asked to return the item. Normally when you return a hygienic item like this, they tell you to dispose of the item not return it. I called Customer service and they explained that they could only do a refund if the item was returned per the seller. This is the first time I ever ran into this. It makes me wonder if they are recycling their product‚Äôs. Needless to say I will not order from this company again."
1.0,I ordered this and my son wore it for about 6 hours when we noticed letters peeling off.  I returned that one and got a replacement. The replacement came out of the package with the letters peeling off. It was such a nice looking jersey we were pretty disappointed.
1.0,Very cheap looking and baggy fit.
1.0,Was too small and very see through
1.0,"This is not as attractive as it is in the picture, and the color is a dull beige instead of the yellow pictured. The double wrap around the wrist is awkward and ill-fitting, and the material feels cheap. When I attempted to return it on Amazon, the estimated refund price was only $2.90 and I paid nearly $10. I'm not a happy customer right now."
1.0,"These are not black, I needed black.  Extremely thin more like leggings not jeans."
1.0,"Hair, lint, anything else you don't want will cling to this thing! Also if you live in a warm climate, you might want to wait until winter for this."
1.0,It was broke
1.0,My daughter said these sunglasses are so fragile that adjusting them made her feel like they would break.
1.0,"The tiny ball ends are not attached well. One popped off while slipping this on my wrist. Also,  these don't have any leaf shapes with them. Just balls at the ends and two plain bracelets and one twisted one. False advertisement."
1.0,"This ""sweater"" has many flaws. It is oversized, which I understand it that is how it is designed. I am 3 weeks postpartum, 5'8 and 180 lbs currently and the medium was very large on me. The sleeves were so long but you couldn't even roll the sleeves up because there isn't any ecstatic or form fitting that wouldn't stay rolled up. It is see through so you would have to wear something underneath. I got this on sale for $10 and I am glad I didn't pay the full price. Definitely not worth $30 +"
1.0,Ripped Booo
1.0,Totals deception!!
1.0,"Very low quality lenses.  Will only use to cut the grass, not even consider driving with these."
1.0,Nose piece is more a universal size does not pop in to place.
1.0,"I bought this product before and had no issues. But I bought again and this set, unfortunately  my daughter's ears got infected from the earrings and the earrings also tarnished after the only 3 days in the ear."
1.0,"Im a size 10mm and bought a size 10mm taper hoping to go up a size, but it‚Äôs the exact same size as my current plug so, i think it‚Äôs mis-sized :/"
1.0,"Not exactly heavy, but made the ear lobe look strange & spider faced the ground so couldn't really see it was a spider.  More like a black blob."
1.0,The blouse was beautiful but it was sized too small. I contacted the seller and two weeks later I still haven‚Äôt heard anything.
1.0,Cheap! Broke of first day of wearing. Poorly made...
1.0,Where the band connects to the watch face was broken and good thing I could switch out with the old bad that came on it
1.0,"I have ordered variations on this item twice from Eyekepper.<br />The first time it was a pair of bifocal reader/sunglasses which are excellent. Great quality in both frames and lenses. Great for reading in bright light. I liked the frames so much that I needed a normal pair of sunglasses with the same frames.<br />The second time, I ordered the same product but with zero magnification. Just sunglasses. What I received were the same frames that I desired, but with very poor-quality lenses. So defective that I returned them and waited for Eyekepper to ship replacements. The replacement pair are also useless as sunglasses. Very poor lenses that barely fit into the frames. The lenses rattle. These sunglasses are trash because of the lenses.<br />Such a disappointment after loving the bifocal readers!!! I am not going to keep returning them over and over again hoping they get it right. Sad."
1.0,Nothing like the pic I've definitely explained I'm 6 feet tall and these are like capri's on me.
1.0,The necklace came tangled so much I cannot get the knots out to wear it. Wasted money
1.0,Received the shirt and it came with no wash information.<br />One wash turned it from a 2XL to a Med/Leg<br />And made it into a half shirt.<br />Horrible quality.
1.0,earrings post broke off the 1st week and stone fell out of one.<br />not worth money.
1.0,"Although the website states that the sweater is  90% COTTON + 10% ACRYLIC, and the sweater has the same label on the inside, this is not cotton at all, it is fully acrylic. Item is being returned."
1.0,"As soon as I pulled this out of the bag I was super disappointed. I thought this was going to be a really cute fitted blazer I could wear to work. This thing is awful! It's a cheap polyester and definitely looks and feels cheap. The inside of the jacket is like a windbreaker material that swishes as you move. Besides the horrible material, the fit is bad as well. It's definitely not a fitted blazer like the description. It's just super boxy and not flattering at all. I ordered a medium which is my normal size in tops & jackets but it was tight on my arms. Definitely returning this monstrosity. Don't waste your time! Also I normally do Amazon returns using a UPS store nearby as I'm not close to any post offices. This only gave me the return option to print a label and return by USPS, just a heads up."
1.0,"These masks were not kids masks, even with the adjustable sides the mask was too big for myself"
1.0,"Only received 9 socks in lieu of 12.  Also, black socks were a different style than the beige socks.  Black socks were tighter/more fitted and included a silicone no slip grip at the heel.  Beige were much larger/not fitted and did not include no slip grip around the sock or at the heel."
1.0,Items does not look like photo. Material was  Rey thin like a cheap bedsheet. Sent it back and I rarely return items.
1.0,Don't bother! Broke same day I got them 0/1000
1.0,Practically see through. The shirt was too big for my husband. My husband usually wears slim fit medium. Planning on returning it
1.0,There is only one setting for lighting up.  There is no permanent lighting feature only when you press.  For the money for each of these I would never buy them again!
1.0,"ACTUALLY, I didn't try the dress on!!!  When I opened the zip lock plastic sealed bag the dress had such an awful smell I didn't want it on my body!!<br />Immediately, I put in back in the bag to be returned!!<br />You can take a chance on washing out the stink! Good Luck!<br />PS&#62; Besides the awful smell the fabric seemed too stretchy and cheap!"
1.0,One side did not work when it arrived.
1.0,The material was cheap.... very thin and clingy. I returned it. I have a navy one that is a totally different material and appropriately sized.
1.0,Cheap material. It faded and was piling after the first wash. Pretty much a waste of money. Disappointed because it was really pretty when I opened it. üòû the neck also ties on the side so you have strings hanging down your shoulder which is really weird to me.
1.0,"I wore these pants for one day and the crotch ripped. I loved them until the rip so I am very sad. So not worth the money. I will never buy these again and wish I could take it back. DO NOT BUY THESE, material TOO THIN and SEAMS ARE HORRIBLE!"
1.0,"I did not care about these clogs. I am stuck with them because I could not return them without incurring exorbitant cost for mailing them back to Germany.  I thought Amazon offered all kinds of protection, when dealers using its sites pull this kind of trick.."
1.0,"I thought I would try this dress but when I received it, the dress was too small. When I contacted the company to return it, they said it would not be cost effective and only issued a partial refund. I typically buy clothing based on the bust measurements and have not had issues. This dress would not fit at the bust and the length was entirely too short for my 5'7"" height. It fit more like a loose tank, not even tunic length."
1.0,"Leather band is to thick,when you tighten the strap & try to put it through the first loop(which isn‚Äôt moveable) you almost tear the loop trying to get it through,I‚Äôll have to get another band just to be able to wear it"
1.0,Looks completely different from the picture
1.0,Third one I‚Äôve ordered in s/m and they have all been to big!
1.0,Size Large please thanks
1.0,"Material not good, looks cheap!"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:530f49734d365c0d90e4c824f1d645c6]] It's nothing like the picture at all. It doesn't have any structure and it's very thin fabric with no support. It's similiar to costume material, as far as quality. I paid $15, so I definately got what I paid for, but the description and photo is 100% inaccurate."
1.0,Cheap slippers that are entirely too small.  Processed a return 2 minutes after opening the box.......
1.0,Hate the dress. Does not fit right. Made cheap.
1.0,The metal on the band changes color - poor quality
1.0,I washed this item in cold water and hung to dry. After only one wash the fabric was pilling and looked worn. I wanted to return but apparently had missed the window to return. I am guessing the item was defective.
1.0,This sweater was boxy and not at all flattering. Returned it.
1.0,Broke when I got it. It was very cute but I couldn't even wear it
1.0,"I sent these back after wearing them for about a minute. They have the worst lenses of any pair of glasses I've ever worn. The lenses have tiny waves in them which makes everything blurry. If I put them on and look at an object in the distance I can see the object come into focus and go out of focus as I move my head slightly.  They are definitely not driving lenses.<br /><br />Other than the horrible lenses, the frames seemed great. I liked the look of them. The frames were very sturdy and solidly built. But I would rather have a good lens with cheap frames than a bad lens with good frames. I shipped these back the same day I received them."
1.0,You cannot write a view when you do not know what‚Äôs on it..
1.0,"topstitching on lapel, and pockets ruined look of blazer IMO."
1.0,Very disappointed I always wanted on of these and it stopped working sometimes so I was going to return but wasn't able to make it by the deadline and now it doesnt work at all waste of money!!!!!
1.0,"Dress was too short. Also, it has 3 white stripes on the front which is not supposed to be there."
1.0,"you cannot find a good - cool lunch bag for kids.  they all get skunked, but the zipper broke on this one inside of two months of use."
1.0,I like the size but the posts are too thick to even put through my earring hole. I cannot wear them.
1.0,"Is supposed to be 3 caps, but unfortunately 2 was delivered. That's was look rip-off to me"
1.0,i ordered it 7 months in advance so i guess i put on to much weight
1.0,Face mask when out and about doing shopping
1.0,"These earrings are terrible!! There are 6 pairs of pearl earrings and each pearl fell of the post, I was shocked, I couldn‚Äôt use 1 pair. I‚Äôm so sorry I wasted my money!!!!!!! Do not buy!!!!"
1.0,This shoes are a joke color not as shown size is not accurate worse purchase ever. Please don't waste your time and money
1.0,This ring turned my finger green within 3 days.
1.0,The butterfly attachment came apart when I took it off to wash the mask.
1.0,So super cute but wore it for a week and my skin started to get irritated- took it out immediately- I always wear titanium or surgical steel never had a problem in like 30 years - do not purchase this item unless you‚Äôre going to wear it for a couple hours for fun
1.0,"I would have given more stars but the band is so cheap it isn't worth more than 1!!! The watch looks great works fine, but I've only had it a couple days and just can't wear it out of fear of it coming undone and then breaking it!! If I dare move my wrist when wearing it, the band simply releases, opens, and the watch slips down my wrist.<br />Buy a better band to start with and you'll be happier than I am!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />After a few weeks of back-and-forth with the Seller, they have promised me a new band. I will update with more info once the new band arrives as they wanted this update before replacing the band."
1.0,"The pants are fine.  But, when you read the description, they lied about drawstring waist.  Unless they do not know what a drawstring waist is?  I have had pants like this before and they do not last, as the waist stretches out for whatever reason.  Probably because the waist elastic is cheap or just because the design is cheap.  I always get a drawstring on pants like these so they last longer.  This is copied from the description-----"" Smocked Waistband With Tassel Ties with Draw string."" This was copied from the description.  I am very disappointed......."
1.0,"Looked really good, had a nice weight to it. Lasted less then a month. Screws on mounts came undone and I almost lost my watch. Tried repairing but now mounts will not click I to place on watch no matter how many adjustments I make."
1.0,Do not order this product! It is cloth NOT bling and it is not even a good picture of it! I contacted seller and they won‚Äôt provide me with paid return label so they offered me 20% refund. AWFUL! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,"If you want a dress that makes you look like you‚Äôve been stranded on an island for months, then this is the dress for you. The small fits like a medium. Doesn‚Äôt hug anything so physical touch is definitely not this dresses love language. Makes you look like the dress has swallowed your chest area and done a magic trick on them to disappear. They only reappear when you take the dress off. Hence why I returned it."
1.0,"Waited 3 days for this, it arrived and was in an ripped plastic bag. I could have overlooked that except the item itself is stretched out, uneven and not only used looking, but not even ""gently used"". Looks like a gorilla wore it! Sent it back within seconds!"
1.0,Size way to small nothing like it was advertised
1.0,Was unable to put this on my watch because of uneven edges on the band. Would not fit. Poorly made.
1.0,These lenses do not fit the frames they are supposedly meant for. They are larger by almost a millimeter around the edge and the shape is off as well.
1.0,Broke after just a few weeks of light use.
1.0,"Gloves are tiny, XL would fit my 5 year old.  Also taking them out of the package a seam broke.  Waste of money."
1.0,A $10.00  rosary posing as a $30.00 one.  Feather light with a flimsy wire connecting the cross to the chain.  In fact the cross fell off mine while it was in a rosary pouch.  I doubt if it would stand up to even occasional light use..
1.0,"This item is not as to picked it in picture it is way too small it came torn at the sleeves the inside lining that supposed to be some kind of free white fluffy material sheds and keep shedding the jacket is super thin feels more like a shammy and looks the same color do not buy this as you  Will be dissatisfied Also it comes in a vacuum sealed bag!  So badly wrinkled even if you decided you wanted it and liked the colored mastered and very cheap looking by all means go ahead everyone has different taste but this is a buyer beware . I went to return it today,  And was told I need to pay that shipping of half the amount of the jacket $16 This jacket is a total rip off if it wasn't for the kind wonderful help of Amazon I would be stuck with it"
1.0,"To small  xxl still to small,will return them"
1.0,"I guess I need to order a size up or maybe it's just defective.  I have a many of these kind of running shirts from other brands, but this Large seriously fits like a small."
1.0,Uncomfortable material and bad fit. Very chunky even though I ordered a small size. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend
1.0,Band clasp fell apart within a day. Too bad. Watch is bold and attractive.....and works!
1.0,Product smells terrible I have tried everything it reeks of some sort of chemical I will not put them on my child I do not even feel safe sending them back to the post office I need the seller to contact me
1.0,"I ordered according to the sizing chart, but this dress does not fit or look good on. Notice in the photo how the underarm and chest area are very baggy.  The colors are very pretty, though.  Note that this is not a returnable item.  When purchasing clothing in the future, I will stick with  items that are clearly noted as &#34;free returns&#34; in the future."
1.0,To return the product. Not what i was looking for
1.0,The leopard band is cute but I had to constantly adjust the strap as it would loosen easily & way too often throughout the day. Also the buckle is made of plastic and broke after a week of wear.<br />Don't waste your money!
1.0,"These COULD be really great but they run very small and even if you order the right size half of them will be the wrong size! I ordered 2 different sizes just to get 3 that fit! I gave the rest to my 12 year old daughter. They are good quality and very comfortable but the sizing is screwed up. Also if you want to contact customer service, call Amazon directly because the seller couldn't care less that you have a problem with they're product."
1.0,"Sized way too small, returned"
1.0,Material s√∫per corriente
1.0,"Ordered 2XL plus size. Normally wear 1,2 XL. Could not even get up passed mid thigh. Really small."
1.0,It's not in the least slim fitting. Looks pretty cheap material-wise too. Sending back tomorrow!
1.0,It‚Äôs not the same photo
1.0,The color of this cardigan is not like the picture. Strange pink color and looks cheap.
1.0,"This item could not even slip into my foot.  I am a consistent size 9 and could not get the slipper on my foot at all. Tried to request an exchange for a size 10 but only option is to send back and re-order.  The price is $20 more. Feel I shouldn't have to pay $20 more because the price went up since I ordered, when the manufacturer does not make the shoe to fit. My experience in the past has been uggs tend to run,argue, so surprising to see I couldn't even get the slipper past my heel."
1.0,Pretty but the pockets are thick and bulge out right by the hip adding &#34;10 lbs&#34; to your figure. Returned!
1.0,The diamond cheapened it up! It looked awful! Wish that ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù wasnt on it!
1.0,The backs of these earrings are very cheap and DO NOT HOLD. Wore them once around town and came home to find that the earring with the cuff had fallen off sometime during the day! Went back and searched for hours to no avail. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1.0,It is VERY VERY big --- too much
1.0,This picture is not what the bathing suit looks like. The bottom part is a lot wider. The straps that connect the top to the bottom (down the middle of the abdominal) are lose and not designed like the picture. The picture has them fanned out (flattering) the actual suit has 4 strips of material that go straight down the middle (parallel) and bunch with any movement. Do not get your hopes high if you want what you order to look like the photo.
1.0,"I finally received my Hippie Soul shirt (Delivery took forever)  I ordered a size bigger, and it‚Äôs too small. So disappointed..."
1.0,Shirt look nothing like the picture!!!! Wifey is not happy
1.0,"The buckle is not comfortable. Leather is too hard and stiff.  I have used other products on it to soften it, and it is not working."
1.0,The Chinese make plastic glasses for their Pilots in case they play in kamikaze
1.0,Fabric was itchy and label says to dry clean. For a one time use it may be fun.
1.0,"The dress is beautiful, however, the one that arrived has a tag saying it is burgundy, but it is really a very bright red. Pretty sure not the color I wanted to wear at my daughter‚Äôs wedding."
1.0,"I tried two different sizes. Even the larger size had no crotch room and no butt room. Who in the world were these made for? This is what happens when we have China make everything. They are tiny little men. American men are becoming quite like them, but there are still lots of manly men. If you‚Äôre a ‚Äúmanly‚Äù man (you know what I mean) find another option."
1.0,"Band that holds the mask on broke 1 hour in to the  Halloween event I went to, and I use my things very genty so this seemed absolutely ridiculous to me, spend a little extra to get one that's of quality or you will be fastening your own strap to it. Love the way it looked for an hour though....."
1.0,you did not have small I tried medium way to big now I'm stuck
1.0,Looks like an Amish skirt. Nothing against them‚Ä¶just Definitelyyyyy not for me.
1.0,They were way way too small.  Tried to gauge before I purchased them.
1.0,The clasp broke as SOON as I took it out of the package.  Didn‚Äôt even get to put it on!  The other one is ‚Äúok‚Äù but I was honestly ripped off.  Gonna try to see if I can somehow ‚Äúrig‚Äù it to work.  Live and learn. The old adage ‚Äúyou get what you pay for ‚Äú is so true!!!
1.0,"This was really inexpensive, and it showed,  the first time my wife tried to put it on it broke so I wouldn't recommend this at all"
1.0,The rose gold color faded immediately. Sorely disappointed.
1.0,Much smaller then it looks in the picture. Ended up not using it. Waisted my money.
1.0,My clock DIDN'T WORK
1.0,Another reviewer described this perfectly. You can‚Äôt even tell it is a sheep because there is at least 6 inches of excess material above the sheep design.
1.0,I do not recommend. Sewing is very weak and inadequate. The neck opening is very small. I do not have a large head. The hood seam ripped off of the neckline when pulling over head. I returned specifying what happened and they would not give me a refund.
1.0,It was very stiff and fell apart within the first week of use.
1.0,These things are seriously gigantic. Plz save yourself sone money.
1.0,"I have Russell sweatshirts that are over 20 years old. The fit, finish and materials have been first rate.  Once they reach ""garage"" status, they seem to last forever. I bought this Russell hoody expecting the same quality, but boy have things changed. The zipper was sewn crocked, and when fully zipped bulged out a few inches. I returned it and asked for a direct replacement. That one was, if anything, worse. Not only was the zipper incorrectly installed, but the main seam on the hood was not flat, it stood up like a Mohawk, and it also wasn't straight. I'm really disappointed, but I'm done with that company."
1.0,"The band is too loose, you cant use the wallet without it."
1.0,The dress material was cheap looking and it was cheaply made<br /> The picture is pretty and classy looking. The actual dress was not.
1.0,It looks nice and breathable
1.0,"Broke the first time it was worn. Very disappointed. It looked good, but it's not made well."
1.0,Did not like it at all stretchy material && the patches yeah I don't like it
1.0,"Poor quality, pockets weren't actually pockets, just flaps sewn on where pockets should have been and were placed very high on the chest and lopsided. Very cheap material. It's a shame. The pattern was so cute."
1.0,Turned finger green.
1.0,JUNK!!!  It literally fell apart before I left my house.
1.0,A large might as well be small. This makes my boobs look like a lumpy A cup when I'm a D.
1.0,"My housemate said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wear those outside the house.‚Äù They are that unflattering. Comfort is fine, but not amazing. I would have returned them if not for Covid."
1.0,I only recieve the t shirt
1.0,Poor-quality junk.
1.0,when it arrived the arrows were broken off  really was disappointed never I ever buy this again.
1.0,"Do NOT order this product.  It is not ""Wine"" colored. They are a bright 80's neon red/ pink. They are also not made in the US as they said in the description. They are made in China. Tried to return these and a pack of purple colored masks - due to the misrepresentation. The company won't refund my money because the products ""aren't damaged."" They are offering me a $2 credit on $18 dollars worth of products and told me to keep them as ""gifts."""
1.0,The quality of these slippers was aweful. They were also not the brand I was expecting. It wound up being a random Chinese brand. The smell that came from them was aweful.
1.0,Way to small for a Extra Large shirt.
1.0,The earrings I received looked nothing like it was advertised. Very disappointed.
1.0,I ordered the dress two sizes bigger because the reviews stated it will run small. It was still too little.
1.0,I just received this bag today. When opened the box the bag was already broken. The strap was inside the bag. It Was send out like this. I am disappointed because I was excited for the size and color of this bag.
1.0,"It may not be the fault of the product, but this is such an unflattering top. It is definitely asymmetrical, and such an odd cut. Not what the picture depicts."
1.0,"Was putting my belt buckle on and when I snapped the snaps one of the snap instantly broke.<br />Belt leather seems good quality, but the snaps suck."
1.0,Got this for my daughter for Christmas and that the product that came was not the product that was listed. You might get to some random necklace not the one shown.
1.0,The fabric was nylon and not what I expected.
1.0,"It was really baggy on me all around. Not very flattering at all, it has no shape and looks like you are wearing a paper bag"
1.0,Definitely not leather as stated!<br />Disliked the fake bling ( didn‚Äôt show up in photo!)
1.0,"I ordered from this company twice. The first time I got the hat it was perfect! The fur was nice and lush and the hat was the perfect size. The second time I ordered the hat a year later (due to wear and tear on the first) it was the complete opposite. The faux fur was cheap, the hat was thin and flimsy, and the hat was WAY smaller. I will be seeking a return due to poor quality."
1.0,"This shirt was extremely small. I ordered an XL, but it was more like a small or medium. Quality is very poor. See through, cheap material not cotton. I wouldn't wast your money."
1.0,Was broken after two month.
1.0,The design was not as pictured on the dress prior to purchase very very poor quality I will keep it but please let company know that they are not producing product as advertised
1.0,Nice looking hoodie but it was super small to be a large disappointed about the size and not being able to exchange it .
1.0,"its say 92% cotton and 9% spandex, on the web page.<br />it is not true it is 95% polyester?????? and  5% spandex, and it looks like it is below the knee, it is above the knee, beautiful dress false information"
1.0,"It didnt turn at all, I got for a gift to my little niece & too late to order a new one. It stayed just the dark black color no matter what temperature it was in. üòï"
1.0,"Had a debit card, credit card, license, and 4 hundred dollar bills. I even placed the 4 bills in between the cards to form a solid structure and it still broke in 2 days. $20 dollars for trash not worth. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,The color & doesnt seem like a maternity shirt
1.0,The material works well but the waist was much tighter than expected
1.0,Picture faded after 2 washes.  The company did refund me though.
1.0,Definitely not true to size
1.0,"Definitely not as pictured , wouldn‚Äôt purchase again. Looks ridiculous"
1.0,"These caps are terrible, paper thin and very cheaply made.  I wouldn't advise any one to buy them."
1.0,The product does not have size tag. Fit very small. Very poor quality. The pants are see-through.
1.0,Thin didn't fit around teeth well.i won't buy again
1.0,"Total crap and waste of money, droped down one time and broke a part, size incorrect to , just  2.75 inch in dianeter"
1.0,"Item arrived and is a very orange color, fabric like cheap vinyl hard and unbending, strap twisted, fake leather closures flimsy and wont stay closed. Back zipper was in middle of track, it zipped but track is bent and will most likely break if used. Cannot return without losing most of price paid for this cheaply made item.  My daughter loves owls anything, and even she did not want this item because of its condition."
1.0,The product description lists 3 chains. The package came with one and that one has a kink in it. Will return pending vendor feedback.
1.0,This is for skinny flat chest women
1.0,I am 5‚Äô2 and 160 lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits but the pockets hit me at a weird spot. The pockets are just below my chest. It isn‚Äôt very flattering. I will be returning this. The print was adorable but just didn‚Äôt look right.
1.0,"The bead strands did not hang down (like pictured), but stuck out and curled up. Messy looking.  Reminded me of spider legs or something.  I tried everything to make them straighten out. It just couldn't be done. Finally got mad and flung them into the waste basket!"
1.0,It's a cheesy dollar store crap. It looks nothing like the picture. I'd send it back but it would cost me more to send it back then what I bought it for.
1.0,"I returned the blouse. It was not flattering...more like a tent. I wasn't able to get the wrinkles out, and it came very wrinkled."
1.0,I got what I paid for. It's pretty but poorly made. It broke the second time I wore it. I just reached into my purse and the stone popped off.
1.0,Very disappointed. Material seems cheap and dress was way too short in the front.
1.0,Item was obviously worn before as it came dirty. Poor quality.
1.0,1 star for cool color. Very thin material. No zipper. Leg shape is made for someone in a kneeling position. Definitely not good quality like my last pair of shift whit3 label pants. I feel they would wear out by squeezing the bike for 1 moto. Legs are very baggy even over knee braces.
1.0,This thing felt like a garbage bag. Material was awful
1.0,Fast shipping. The pants are completely see through. Went to one work out class and the material started to rip.  Waste of money
1.0,I got an adult small and the shirt fits my eight-year-old versus my 14-year-old. Material is poor quality and course texture. Waste of money!
1.0,"I missed the window to return it, so I had to donate the pants... They are smaller than expected and the material is very itchy and poorly made."
1.0,They we not d calf shoes at all
1.0,"The fabric was disappointing.  I did not like anything about this blouse.  It did not drape right, the fabric was thin, and the fit was terrible.  They did refund my money without any issues."
1.0,The picture on the mask is so unclear you can‚Äôt tell what it is.  I would not recommend this certain mask.
1.0,Please note!!! 95% POLYESTER!!! UGH! I returned this dress!
1.0,Keep getting late üòî
1.0,Very big face wasn‚Äôt like the picture looks. It smells of petroleum so bad it made me sick üò∑ so very disappointed
1.0,very overpriced for the size of the earrings
1.0,Received product and used for a week. It randomly broke off my wrist. Was not tight on my wrist; just poor material.
1.0,Broke soon after opening.
1.0,"This sweater came smelling heavily perfumed and with what looked like both at and human hair on it. It still had a tag on it, so it couldn't have been laundered. But it was definitely not as new as I would expect new clothes to be."
1.0,The minute hand fell off after 50 days and the 30 day warranty has expired. Will not buy another one!
1.0,I bought these jeans and put them on....the zipper was broken right from the start. This has gotten to be the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought!
1.0,"I wear a size 12 in pants and ordered an XL.  Description actually recommends ordering a size down but I wanted them to fit loosely.  The are bunched at the waist as in the description, very light weight, however the are polyester and wont be breathable in SE Texas!  The seams down the leg are not loose at all and the hem was stitched to tightly so they actually are smaller at the bottom.  I cannot recommend these shorts."
1.0,Ordered these for all three of my kids and within a week of use they are falling apart.
1.0,Clearly what I bought isnt new.<br />It literally had someone‚Äôs blister in the side pocket.<br /><br />I got someone‚Äôs seconds.
1.0,"The pics on here make it look much nicer than it is. There is a back on the blue glass, it would have looked so much nicer without it."
1.0,This broke the day I got it.
1.0,Dress not as pictured. Looks like you‚Äôre wearing a curtain. Not cute at all!
1.0,"The idea of this shirt is great, the execution poor or at least the one I got.I usually wear US size M, I am 5.7 tall 130lb.I got the shirt in size L, based on reviews.When I tried it on, the shoulders were kind of all right, compared to the rest of the shirt, where 3 of me could fit.Very strange and uncomfortable style, I could even say funny.The sleeve ruffle is sewn together with the ruffle section of the shirt the waist I guess, so if I want to put my glassess on, I have to lift up the whole shirt.I am returning it."
1.0,"Not well made, wrinkles easily"
1.0,Unfortunately both sides were too big even after cutting and trimming.  Also didn‚Äôt line up with the holes in the frame.  Ended up buying from another mfgr (from Japan) which fit perfectly.
1.0,"I don't see an address to return, seems come from China. Brass are too small"
1.0,This product is nothing like advertised. The color is nothing like the picture. I ordered dark green and its this weird light green. I ordered a size up as suggested and it is too tight. I wear large and had ordered an extra large. It is cheap for the price. Strings not long enough for the design in the pictures.
1.0,Nice case but the glasses are useless.  No anti-reflective coating makes these useless.  Nothing but background reflection and glare. Unfortunately no return on these either.
1.0,"Poor Quality, SIze CHarts are inaccurate, and service is terrible"
1.0,The quality is very poor. It's basically a pillowcase with a ruffle and scrap fabric thrown in as a belt.
1.0,"This suit was way too small! I am 5'7 and 120 lbs. I am very thin, but trying to fit into this (size medium) suit was like a Chris Farley skit! The length was not long enough and the leg openings would have cut off my circulation if worn for an extended period of time."
1.0,"I couldn't wait to get these off, they clung to me and were very ugly."
1.0,"If this is a size large, I hate to think how minuscule the children's size small must be! There is no difference between this flimsy thing and far cheaper cloth masks available at the corner drugstore. There is no pocket to hold a filter, making it ridiculously ineffective -- and downright dangerous if you're trying to use it in a typical choir setting. I'm immune-suppressed, so I need a quality singer's mask, not a cheap excuse for one. Wearing this mask, I could not fully open my jaw to sing and the cloth constantly sucked into my mouth as I tried to take a breath. This was a complete waste of time and money. Why Amazon would have me send it back rather than tossing it in the garbage where it belongs is beyond me."
1.0,got an empty box with no watch and on the box bottom it even said mans gold bracelet gold instead of watch . very fishy
1.0,If i could give 0 stars i would. Cheaply made. Very thin. See through almost.
1.0,Cheep looking don‚Äôt look like the picture
1.0,"I bought this dress to lounge in. Of course I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be fancy, but it is total garbage. The straps are very cheap and the pockets are huge and hit at the worst possible place on my hips. The dress is too big in all the wrong places."
1.0,I wore this 4 times & then it completely fell apart. Tried to fix it but was unable to
1.0,"Material is not comfy and it is waaaaay too long. For a medium, I felt like it should have been a large extra extra long."
1.0,"I bought this in a L and XL because I wasn‚Äôt sure which would be better.  By the time I got around to trying it on it was well passed the return date. But I really wish I had tried it on ahead of time. I tried on the XL first‚Ä¶ and omg.. it suffocated my thighs! The leg holes were so tight and small. Also this is nowhere near as high waisted as it looks on the model. I don‚Äôt think it even reaches my belly button. Also it does nothing for you. Like zero snatching, zero tummy control, zero anything! Waste of money for me.  I‚Äôve literally never worn them."
1.0,"ARRIVED BROKEN. Seller a scammer. Would not help with return. Asking Amazon to help. So sorry I bought this item. ALSO, it took about 3 weeks to get this item. Note this item runs small. That is fine with me, I have a tiny wrist. This bracelet would be better suited to TINY wrists or a child."
1.0,Why don't you make the boot waterproof??? What good is that in the snow to parents who are looking for a snow boot?
1.0,"Paper thin junk, ripoff do not buy!  Tried to send back and seller said,<br /><br />Hello,<br />Thank you for contacting us.<br />We are so sorry about the size do not fit for you.<br />According to the return freight are too expensive,we sugget that you can keep it and give it to your friend who like it.<br />To express our apology,we can refund 20% amount to you.<br />What do you think?<br />Look forward to your reply.<br />If you have any question,please feel free to contact us.<br />Best Regards."
1.0,All of the hardware is plastic. I found this out when my shoulder strap broke. So I started carrying with the double handles and they ripped out!!
1.0,I bought a Northface beanie for $50 8 years ago and it still good. I wanted another one so I went through amazon. This is poorly made and seems like a knock off. Do not buy!!
1.0,The waistband is awful and comes up to my rib cage! Fabric is very sheer. Returned these immediately
1.0,Was not the color I wanted & had a stain on jacket.
1.0,Sent wrong color. Cheaply made too
1.0,"Cute cut, horrible parachute pant material."
1.0,Made mostly of plastic. Not very heavy duty at all. The LED lights on the handle however work well. I'd pay $5.99 for this.
1.0,"I wasn't expecting a piece of expensive jewelry at this price, but what I got was just ridiculously cheap and trinket-y. Unless you want that dollar store look, choose another item."
1.0,I am very disappointed I paid the money waiting for delivery and when I opened the package it turned out that the watch should not be worn on the hand. There is no fastener on a thong. What should I do now send them back or is it now a table clock. Very sorry for the lost time.
1.0,Broke after 2 days do not buy waste of money
1.0,"Very uncomfortable and a bit too small, but even the larger pair where uncomfortable."
1.0,"I liked the flow of the legs on this pant compared to other paper waist pants but couldn‚Äôt get over how itchy the fabric was. So uncomfortable, will be returning."
1.0,Horrible product and worse customer service (if that's possible). DO NOT BUY. Save your money. I love bamboo socks and these are the WORST pair I have ever purchased.
1.0,Fell apart almost immediately after I got it. Not happy with this.
1.0,Received it with threads hanging and it RIPPED just putting it on as you would any other top. At least the color is accurate üò†üò†
1.0,"I ordered a ""L"" which is what I normally wear, but also ordered an ""XL"" because I know Asian clothes run small but the ""XL"" was way too small.  so tight I could barely get it on an off.<br /><br />I bought both sized as the prices was small enough that I could donate the smaller one if it didn't fit but neither of them fit.  My XL shirts in the US usually are a bit loose so this sizing is way off.<br /><br />I would assume that if Asian countries are going to market to other countries they would adjust their clothing sizes to fit their market that they are targeting but this has not been the case.<br /><br />Their sizing is way off.  I doubt even an ""XXL"" would barely be a ""L"" in the US.  So if anyone buys from this company beware!"
1.0,This is an updated review.<br />This necklace was so beautiful.  5 months later and the chain is a pile of rust. The back of the rectangle charm is rusty.  I‚Äôm so disappointed because the person I gave it to was so happy to receive it.
1.0,Not good don't waste your money
1.0,I'd give zero stars if possible. I was sent 2 broken earrings.
1.0,Looks ugly in person
1.0,"2 of the 3 broke. Save your money it‚Äôs not worth it, they didn‚Äôt even last a month."
1.0,This is what they sent me don't buy this product it's a waste of money I wore the jewelry for 2 minutes and it broke into pieces never buying that againüò•üò•
1.0,The material is see through and not at like the photo.  The seems show through and don't look very good at all.  I asked to return the item but the seller didn't really want me to send it back and wouldn't give me a full refund.
1.0,I own 40+ Nina Queen charms. And each one received was more beautifully crafted then the one before. This skiiing owl is also gorgeous- I just wish the quality had lasted the same as the others. One of the little silver beads that hangs off the ski broke off and now o vioisly past the return or exchange for another one has passed. It makes me want to sit down and examine all the others more carefully.
1.0,I waited over  two weeks for this coat and when it finally arrived it didn't fit. I ordered xl and it couldn't even fit my sister who wears mediums this was to be my winter coat and now I'm freezing and out 40$ going to send it back as soon as possible or end up selling it online
1.0,Biggest MK fan alive! Unsure if it‚Äôs MK or Amazon but just shy of having this watch it broke and it‚Äôs been a hassle trying to get it repaired or replaced. I own multiple watches by MK although purchased direct I‚Äôm pretty disappointed
1.0,Stone fell out on 2nd wearing of hoop
1.0,"Brim too floppy. Hat was shoved in mailbox. NOT happy, creased the brim."
1.0,Very poor quality and too large. Material is paper thin.
1.0,"While I would normally wear an XLG or 2XLG based on the size chart I ordered a 4XL. Not even close. I'd guess..I'd need about a 6xl at least. Also, overpriced IMO. Could get something very similar,reasonably sized at that one stop shop that we all love to hate. The quality isn't that bad. They look like they would be comfortable They are just very, very small."
1.0,the lens on these are not curved they are totally flat so they look very strange wearing and looking through them.the return process was very easy tho
1.0,Look how bad the packing and the glasses were even damaged. Don't waste your money on it!
1.0,"The chest was really small for my 38D boobs. The rest of the dress fit my hourglass shape just fine. Even though I washed it in cold water and hung to dry, the red bled onto the white and ruined the dress. I was really looking forward to wearing it on vacation and couldn‚Äôt."
1.0,"Wanted to love these, but the gold one came tangled beyond what I could un do and the silver one broke the first time wearing it."
1.0,This is not a real nike sports bra. The material is way to thin and doesn't has the support like nike sports bras
1.0,Low quality. Didn't look like photo at all.
1.0,"I was so disappointed to get this dress because it's several sizes too small. Despite other reviews stating it runs true to size, I ordered a size up to allow some forgiveness and allow for alterations if needed. The dress was super short, at least 3-4 inches off of the ground in the front, very short train but probably because it was so short! It didn't fit over my hips/butt and no chance that it would close in the back. The lace work was damaged as well. DO NOT ORDER from this seller. They will not issue you a refund in any sort of timely fashion and will BULLY YOU to leave a fraudulent positive review."
1.0,Me enviaron algo que no pedi pedi gris y negro blanco y negro me enviaron los 2 blanco y negro no tienen orden con 2 articulos da asco ....
1.0,Very cheaply made. It‚Äôs paper thin
1.0,Didn‚Äôt cover like the picture shows
1.0,Earrings snag on everything
1.0,Not worth the money and not was was advertised
1.0,"Product advertised as 3 pack, however only received 1 shirt. If known, would not have ordered."
1.0,"These are beautiful earrings, but the packaging is poor.  The backings are bent; therefore, I am returning them."
1.0,These cause cancer and birth defects don't wear them!!
1.0,"Cheap knockoffs. Not what is pictured in these ads. Thin material.  NOT SUEDE. Soles are cheap rubber. Not what is shown in pictures. Ship from CHINA.. Various sellers, but NOT WHAT IS IN THE ORIGINAL PICTURE. DON'T BUY THESE!!!!!!"
1.0,doesnt even look like the one in the picture when bought.
1.0,"The item is sold as ‚Äúcouple‚Äôs‚Äù matching T-shirt‚Äôs but when you add to your cart, you have to add each one even although you had initially selected a size for each person. You have to buy each one separately and it does not state that."
1.0,"Poor quality, bottoms faded and seams not matched up"
1.0,"broke the first time I put it on, band snapped"
1.0,I do not like the glasses....very difficult to use...always folding up...no idea why they are so flimsy<br />I had no idea when I bought them they folded up in so many pieces
1.0,"Backs of earrings are way too long. Ordered for my daughter and they are too long for an adult to wear. Posts hit the back of neck and hurt! Would not buy these again, rip off!!!!"
1.0,I'm a size 14. I ordered this coat in 3xl. It fit like I had put on a size 8. Even if I was a size 10/12 this 3xl wouldn't have fit. Sending it back.
1.0,The clamp was broken when we got it‚Ä¶.
1.0,The  legs are too long. I am 5‚Äô7 and this is too large around the hips. I gave it to my tall friend.
1.0,Not what i thought it was. Only one piece! The ring was not glued to the rose. Very disappointed.
1.0,No es de buena calidad.
1.0,will not pair with the app. Useless
1.0,"I ordered an XL, because I am a big girl...These shorts are a XS, if they are anything...Going to give them to my 6 yr old grandson that weighs a whopping 40 lbs, if they are not too small for him....VERY DIS....no wonder they were only a penny. Oh, had to give one star or I couldn't leave a comment...go figure."
1.0,Not actually Versace though the posting makes it seem as though it is.
1.0,These didn't fit my Earlobe properly.  There was a large space between the bottom of my earlobe and the gems. Had to return.
1.0,Nothing to review really- I usually wear a medium but I couldn't get these over my thighs- I am a small to average 5 ft woman.
1.0,Light weight and flimsy
1.0,Did not fit properly
1.0,Earrings are very difficult to get on and fall off easily and constantly.
1.0,"These were suoer cool....until they broke and i foubd out they were plastic, not wood"
1.0,All 5 I received were different than shown in the ad.  The packaging was different.  The appearance was different. Mine were oval shaped and thick.  The sound was different.  The sound was a whole lot weaker than advertised in the video. It wasn't loud enough to even annoy someone much less attract attention.  The alarm frequently went off because it bumped something in my purst or my pocket.  To make things worse I couldn't even get in touch with the company to return the items.  I could only get looped in a interactive phone recording.
1.0,"Very flimsy, all decor is glued; do not recommend- returned mine"
1.0,"The material is like a satin and shows every lump. Also runs small. I ordered one size up to a large and it was snug around the hips, belly, and top. Even after tying the front it was still revealing and tacky looking. I'm 5'3 160 36b"
1.0,Product delivered is not as pictured.  The hat is missing the side logo.
1.0,"This nightgowns material is extremely hard, not soft quality and the material is not stretchy. Very disappointed !"
1.0,What the heck? Nothing like the photo. Yuck!
1.0,Junk. Very thin. Fell apart in the seams. First time I wore it.
1.0,Came apart in under 24 hours. Didn't expect much for the price but still...
1.0,"I returned this product.  The item was just what I wanted, but the Small I ordered was way too large."
1.0,This is a cheap cotton material and when I pulled it out of the package it looked like a potato sack
1.0,These were actually child pants that were sent to me
1.0,"I wear a size 16 in pants and a xl  usually fits in leggings but these were way small they looked more like a small or maybe medium and the fabric become see through if you have a size to small, I checked the tag and it said xl but when I tried to put them on I couldn't even get them past my calf.... but other than that they are ok for the price, I gave them toa friend who is much smaller, hopefully they fit"
1.0,"Bra shelf is too small in the large.  I did expect when you order a large, the shelf would accommodate a larger breast area. The fabric though is very soft and well made."
1.0,This item was very cheap looking (and feeling).  It's so light I thought it was made from gold painted rice.<br />I am definitely returning this.  Do  you carry  any good jewelry?  This bracelet cost about $800.00.  What a joke?
1.0,To small as well as not like the pictures described
1.0,shirt looks like a potato sack... stay away
1.0,I just didn‚Äôt like it on me
1.0,Its very thin like silky not good to keep warm and bigger than the size.
1.0,Picture is extremely misleading.
1.0,"baggy , baggy after two hours use."
1.0,Came unstuck as soon as I began to sweat. üò¢
1.0,The dress was way too big and baggy. I'm a true size medium in practically anything that I buy in stores like I look like a sack of potatoes in it. Save your money.
1.0,These earrings look cute in the picture but when I received them I noticed that the earring hook was backwards. So I started to fix them where the earring hook was correct and the jump ring was too small and the earring won't move easily on the hook. It's like it gets stuck. I tried using a larger jump ring and that didn't really work either. Not sure what I will do now with them.
1.0,Not as pictured. Different brand send as substitute. Very disappointing as I was replacing my original pair and these are nothing like the originals.
1.0,Item sent back too large
1.0,leaked no matter what adjustments
1.0,If you‚Äôre taller than 5‚Äô5 this isn‚Äôt for you. We got this & the pavers are really high. 5‚Äô9 & the boots coming up over the pants saved us.
1.0,Colors are far off from the posted photos. Poorly advertised.
1.0,Would not ever buy again. Shoes aren‚Äôt well made and they fit very small where the toe holder is but the front is also way too big to hold your foot. Ugh
1.0,Weird looking and wrong color was sent 2 times.  It doesn't look like the picture.  Not flattering.
1.0,"My daughter is 5'4, 113 lbs, a size 0 would have fit her, the size 2 is what we got was too big. The seller is a nightmare..... dress was beautiful but not even close to worth the hassle!"
1.0,Cheaply made.  Not what I expected.
1.0,"The size ""14-16"" is more like an 8. They are tiny."
1.0,These definitely are NOT compression tank tops as it says . Just very thin light weight tank tops . Would not have purchased if they weren't falsely represented in the description.
1.0,Terrible. Was supposed to come with both outfits. Only came with one. And the outfit it came with I have no idea how it will ever fit. Not made for the size that‚Äôs listed.
1.0,"Did not fit as advertised, very tight on my calfs. Returned for refund unhappy with overall process."
1.0,Can't get the ball in the ring because it's too tight
1.0,Absolute junk!
1.0,Is this is the most cheaply made piece of crap I've ever seen in my life. $200 for what? The only thing this item is good for is a costume. It's a joke do not buy does not look anything like the item pictured. I highly doubt there's any gold in it too heavy. The clasp is cheaply made very flimsy for the weight that is supposed to hold. If there was Zero stars on here I would have mashed that button buyer beware.
1.0,"The white laces pictured are slightly distressed, but the laces I received are not as pictured. They are plain white laces and definitely not replacements for gg‚Äôs."
1.0,Wore this dress one time and it ripped all down the side before the night was over. It was not tight on me at all. I loved the look but super cheap quality. I am so dissappointed.
1.0,Don't know why I wasted my money. A cheap towel accomplished the same results. Really unhappy with this purchase.
1.0,"I got the blue and white stripe and was pretty disappointed when I opened them. They look like they would be a loose fitting, linen type short, but they are like a starchy, stiff cotton. There‚Äôs no give in the fabric.  They ran super small. I‚Äôm a size 12 and I couldn‚Äôt even zip the XL up halfway."
1.0,"These are cheap, thin ""dresses"".  The quality is suspect.  Save your money for something better."
1.0,This would be super cute if the manufacturer had proper quality control. The red seam alignment guides are visible all around the waist on both back and front. From other reviews this seems to be an issue with this product and not an isolated case. So I opted for a return and refund and spent a little bit more for a better made leotard.
1.0,Very unhappy with this product. First time out of the box to wear and the post just fell off. No option to return or exchange since I‚Äôm past the ‚Äúreturn window‚Äù.
1.0,Of course it broke a few day's after the return window expired !!! Can't find a way to fix it either! Don't  waste your money on this belt!!!
1.0,Fits very small . Cups are not big.<br />Lace doesn‚Äôt like to stay tied
1.0,Nothing trying to return it. The code that was given to me Ups stated it‚Äôs wrong???
1.0,Material is cheap sent back for refund
1.0,"I wanted to love this romper. However, the cut and fabric were not up to par."
1.0,"Hair tie does not stay on bracelet, it will slide right off.  I do not recommend this."
1.0,"The shirts were not supposed to shrink in the wash, they fit well when I bought them, two or three washes they fit like a belly shirt. I had to donate them, as they were no longer long enough."
1.0,Not sure about these.
1.0,"they provide a size chart that goes from s to xxl.  i use xxl and chose that size. based on the measurement data they provide.  the software converted that to l, which apparently is the largest they provide.  i have a 50 inch chest. the L size they sent is far to small. it is probably a medium by usa standards.  other wise the shirt might be ok.  the fabric is very thin, which might mean it is cool.  i suspect that if you get a bit moist from sweat this shirt will stick to your skin and not be cool.  especially if it is tight."
1.0,"Very cute for my granddaughter but the quality is not good at all. Defective zipper, poor stitching, would never survive an airline.<br />VERY poor craftsmanship. strings all over the place. Zipper partially wont close, leaves a gap. Under the lining is thin cheap wood. Would not buy again. Would have returned it but my granddaughter travels in 2 days."
1.0,water entering in side
1.0,This was a disappointment.
1.0,"waste of my money long enough and  big enough in waist but I split the seam in my crotch twice, threw them away"
1.0,Disappointed as it fell off my glasses within the first few times I wore them. I installed the nose piece as it should be installed and it never fit like the original one. Sadly my glasses are useless without the nose piece.
1.0,Made very cheap. Didn't last a month.
1.0,Item not true too size too small
1.0,This watch looked nice on but unfortunately the screen kept going in and out even a battery change.  Very disappointing!
1.0,I like the color. But hate the band.  Which this was like the ones for charge 2.  I had to take off the band due to it started to rust on the silver thing on the band shown in the photo.  Hat this band. Not worth it.
1.0,Too small. Not worth the price
1.0,"Good price, but not worth it. Does not cut tape or anything else well. Broke the first time they were dropped from 1 foot."
1.0,Leaves blueish/purple permanent stain on pillows when you sweat.
1.0,"Runs big, really big. NOT the same color at all!<br />I‚Äôm a size M and I ordered size M but this T-shirt looks like size L or maybe XL<br />This is the grey color. Yes it is grey but it doesn‚Äôt look like the color in the picture"
1.0,This was for my granddaughter she loved them.  The problem is they are made horrible 1st time wearing them ripped all along g the seam.  DON'T WAIST YOUR MONET!!!!!!!
1.0,The color is beautiful and the sizing was true however this was extremely sheer and would require a top underneath so a larger size would be better. Also it was extremely scratchy and uncomfortable to wear so I returned this top. It does not look like the picture at all. More of a boxy fit.
1.0,"Not impressed. Unless you're lucky enough to have the right size fingers, it's impossible to wear the rings as they are shown."
1.0,cheap quality but it was cheap price
1.0,not white - off white and very small and not nearly as long as it appears in the photo
1.0,Was not happy at all.  Didn't like the look/style.  Not worth returning but i guess i'll just keep it as something to wear when i work around the house.
1.0,I don‚Äôt know whoever took pictures of this dress did a very good job taking pictures because when I actually got to dress it looks nothing like it it‚Äôs not flattering whatsoever dress looks beautiful I brought it to four to wear it to church and it looks nothing like the pictures the model that we have this dress she‚Äôs doing a very good job because if you got a little booty on yourself and a little bit of chest on yourself and I got a large and it was still too big and then the little things on arms now not for me sorry you buy it at your own risk it might look better when somebody else just didn‚Äôt look right on me at all
1.0,I was very excited for this dress. Sadly I'm disappointed in it. The color is great and it is very comfy. The fabric is too thin and clingy. You can clearly see the white bra I'm wearing and the print of my leggings. Because the fabric is clingy you can see my waistband as well as the seams of my leggings and bra. I will not return this but will use as a nightgown.
1.0,I bought this watch on Amazon on October 29th 2014. On December 5th of December of 2014 it broke.<br /><br />The quality is very poor and not returnable. I am a Amazon prime customer and not very happy with the product or Amazon.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Rides up super bad because of the elastic waiste
1.0,"The size is fine but we I am displeased with the color description.  We ordered the RED and it is definitly morePINK than red. Also, the only lace it came with are rainbow not the black as pictured.  I am in a catch because we need them immediately and the size is the only cleat that work for the foot size."
1.0,Small. Light garbage.
1.0,Cheaply made.  Apron started falling apart shortly after purchase & suction cups don't stay stuck to the mirror.
1.0,This coat was terrible!  It was too small. The materials of the coat was cheap. This was supposed to be a Christmas and it was a major disappointment!
1.0,None of the sand falls through. The mesh is too small. We were at a white powder sand beach and we brought every ounce home with us. None fell through the mesh. That's the only reason I bought this bag.
1.0,Does not even look like photo. Collar is very small. It‚Äôs not as fluffy as seen in photo<br />2xl is more like a 3-4xl
1.0,I wear a 3X and this was not a 3X
1.0,Not happy... I purchase a frame 51mm as you described and came me 54mm... I have a small face and 54mm not fit well. I'm going to return it.
1.0,"The pants fit well and are super cute but the second I put them on and bent over to pick something up, I realized they are completely see through. Cheap material, I returned them the same day I got them in mail"
1.0,"Just received the gold beads and they are not what is pictured. The only one that matched the picture is the tiger head.  Otherwise there are only 6 patterns: hand, cross, mercedes symbol, dancing girl, head, and tiger head. A big bag of useless junk, nothing even remotely like what is pictured. I will be returning."
1.0,De baja calidad
1.0,Would not recommend this leggings. These are not a one size fit all!
1.0,Buckle broke in 2 weeks. Poorly made.
1.0,It was poorly made. It was very thin fabric and the fit was like it was for a kid. A skinny one at that!
1.0,"I bought 2 on lightning deal and sent them back.  I'm small (5'3, 113 lbs) and the size small was weirdly loose on me. Material was cheap and pattern wasn't consistent."
1.0,FAKE! Not a real Colin Noir  pew pew shirt!!
1.0,They are a nice silky feel but unfortunately their fit was just too small. I gave them to my teenager who wears a medium/large and these were a xxl and were only a little big on her.
1.0,Do recommended
1.0,Strap broke after two months. And I didn‚Äôt even have heavy things in there. Cheaply made
1.0,"Not soft, not like silk or satin"
1.0,"Very Disappointed! I bought two wallets, (the grey horses and the black rose patterns) -Both delivered One Full Month Late, and the grey one had yellow stains on it and was bent out of shape. Neither had a smooth glossy look/feel to them the way the pictures make it look, and are very cheaply made. I wouldn't recommend."
1.0,While pulling them up they ripped brand new on the first day! I can‚Äôt believe this happened!
1.0,Absolutely awful. They were falling apart as I took them out of the box. They were a definite return!
1.0,Ordered the largest size and it still was to small
1.0,"Fake stones, glass and turned my ears.  Tarnished metal in 1 week"
1.0,Poor craftsmanship. I'd give it negative stars if I could. It broke inside my daughters newly pierced ear. It was only in for 2 seconds and the front completely separated from the post....and then she freaked out and is now slightly traumatized about changing her earrings.<br /><br />Just an fyi the horse is much larger then the amazon photo appears.
1.0,"I normally wear a size large in juniors for hoodies (JC Penny's) & they fit fine.  This in L was like an XS or S - VERY TINY!  Probably why they're on sale because they are mis-sized.  Didn't realize when I bought it that it was not returnable.  I buy from Amazon specifically because you normally can return or exchange things free of charge.  This was a total waste of of $10.  There's also no 'pouch' (which didn't make sense, I've only heard of raincoats coming in pouches!).  The material is thin but nice.  I am really upset the sizing is so far off.  I read the 1 review it ran small but I thought that was meant because it's juniors, for juniors I order large, in regular adult I order medium, so I thought I'd already accounted for that but these run much, much smaller than they should.  I'm 5'2&#34; & 120 lbs, there's no way I should need to buy an XL anything!!!!  They shouldn't sell this without letting people know about the sizing problem or accepting size exchanges free of charge.  This was very misleading & I'm very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this!!"
1.0,"I was happy to see it arrived early, but when I opened up the box to see the shirt. I noticed that it was way too small. I asked for a large but what I got was a small from the looks of it. I could make out the size as there was no tag anywhere on the inside of the shirt. I just ended up giving it as a Christmas gift instead ."
1.0,I was given a red butterfly and a white one as gifts. After less than a month each butterfly lost a stone. Very disappointed
1.0,"This watch is nothing more than a swap shop special where the $6.00 to $10.00 watches are sold and it looks like a Cracker Jack toy.  There is NO brass anywhere on the watch.  The bezel is pot metal which is shiny like cheap tin and the band is very, very shiny cheap plastic. Not leather and not rubber. A different Amazon Seller has the same watch listed for $120.00 less and it isn't worth that hugely discounted price.  It's a very young child's first watch and he or she would like it only because of Snoopy.  One huge rip off at any price. Obviously I returned it."
1.0,Way too loose.  I went by their size chart too.
1.0,It was way smaller than I wanted disappointed
1.0,Beautiful earrings but they broke after the first use
1.0,No where near size it should be
1.0,"Do not order this ... it is a fake under shirt , it does not fit well or even lay correctly on the body ... was a bad buy for sure"
1.0,"I am returning these.  They smell like kerosene, I aired them out and they still smell {and were to be a gift for my daughter} but also the velcro on one side is hanging on by one corner.  Other than that they would probably be perfect!!"
1.0,"I do love this purse and it's very spacious. Lots of pockets. Nice material. But it has this really weird smell to it. It's not overwhelming, however when I pulled it out of the wrapper it had this smell. It isn't strong just an observation.<br />UPDATE: It‚Äôs been about 5 months, I carried it wherever I went. The first picture is when I first opened it. The next are what is now beginning to happen to it. The straps come undone, discoloration to the leather, parts of it are coming off. Just not a very good purse...have to get a new one now."
1.0,"This hat is really wonky and made kinda boxy. Doesnt fit me or the husband. Not sure what happened, maybe a Manufactured defect or could have been a knock off. Disappointed"
1.0,The cheapest made shoe ever.
1.0,Color not as expected..material not as expected.
1.0,"These seem like great little kids sunglasses, but we have ordered turquoise color 3x, and have received 3 different colors each time. I kept thinking they would get it right but no luck!"
1.0,Beware. The left side motor stop working in 5 months.
1.0,"came to me Brooke , and the return  requirement was a little to much to do ,"
1.0,Did not work for me at all. Completely disappointed.
1.0,This flops on my ear because it‚Äôs way too big!
1.0,"its baby blue and white, not the color pictured. I ordered a large and the top part probably reached the bottom of my breasts. i felt like it was a suit for a 10 year old,, as far as sizing, other than that it was flattering, for a petite figure"
1.0,COVID-19
1.0,"Loved this ring, it is delicate and comfortable.  I wore it for one month and then it broke.  I contacted the seller, and they said they were producing an improved batch of rings and sent a prom code to get a free one to replace the one that broke.  The rings were out of stock, though.  Now, the promo code won't work.  So, I'm stuck with a broken ring that is beyond the return date.  Waste of money and time dealing with trying to replace it.  If the seller wanted to make things right, they could have sent a new ring when they had the new batch...I shouldn't have had to re-order with a code that doesn't work."
1.0,This dress ripped all the way in the back the first time I wore it. Completely cheaply made and ruined my evening as you can imagine üòí
1.0,Received two of these key chains and both fell off the ring in less than a week.
1.0,Cute suit but sizing seems off on top vs bottom. The top fits and is cute on my daughter but the bottoms are too baggy and almost fall off. I‚Äôm afraid to size down on them though and the top be even smaller.
1.0,It's too small of a size unsatisfied with the product.
1.0,"I ordered 3 shirts from same company, and 8 shirts total, all XL or 2 x, It was very disappointing the shirts are nice and fit great, strong material and good feel."
1.0,"COMPLETE waste of money, I put it on around 2pm, it is now 6:30 and it already broke. I didn‚Äôt shower with it, didn‚Äôt wear socks or anything of the sort. Just broke."
1.0,This is a women's coat based on the zipper and the sizing is women's sizes.
1.0,Cheap a$$ garbage for $64 - Reef should be ashamed of themselves.  I own 2 pair of Reef sandals and love them.....these are crapola.
1.0,"This beanie was very cute & in good condition, but it was just way too small to fit my 6 month old boy's head."
1.0,They did not help me to see better and my eyesight is not bad I just wanted to better see my application and I could not even use them for that
1.0,It wasn't what I thought I'm sending it back. I didn't like the lining and the opening was too small.
1.0,Well what can I say
1.0,This was too small for me as an adult. Would be good gift for a child
1.0,They are shown to petite and cute. They are large and ugly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.!! I am so disappointed in this product.
1.0,"The fit was great. The motorcycle was great. However, that is immaterial since the sleeves came out with holes in them after being washed only a few times. My grandson was very disappointed."
1.0,I ordered these on June 21st 2021 for my 2yr old grandson. Last night after his bath we put them on as normal and about 10min later he comes running with it in his hand looking like this! There's no way that they should be tearing up in less than 60days. So disappointed that I have to buy another pair already!
1.0,elastic waist way to tight
1.0,"This dress was giant. The length was okay, but I wear a Medium and there was way too much material! If I were to return it and get another, I would have to go down 1-2 sizes. I am not normally a small or extra small."
1.0,"Idk if it applies for every size, but I ordered 1/2in guages and they were 100% a size too small."
1.0,"From the pictures you'd expect to get some super cute flowy linen set. It's none of those things. It's a very stiff material that is not flowy at all. It is white, but that's about the only thing that is accurate. I ordered a small as that's my usual size and I guess it fits fine (again, fitted though- not flowy). I'lll keep it to just wear around the house, but don't this set to be anything like the pictures."
1.0,"I purchased XXLarge. The shirt is more like Small or Medium at best. If you are ordering this item, order it 4 sizes larger than you normally wear."
1.0,"The models in the photo show it matches the size of a normal persons face.  When I received the mask the photo is enlarged bigger than any normal face. I get one of two responses when I wear it in public, ""That's funny!"" or : That's creepy!""  I just want to look like I'm not wearing a stupid mask"
1.0,I received an XL- but the neck is for a M.<br />I could BARELY get it over my head and then it felt super uncomfortable and close to my neck.
1.0,Looks cheap.  The coloring is too yellow.
1.0,"I ordered this capri Jan, 29, 2015 and washed ten times. I did not wear every day maybe once a week. Now I can not wear it any more because one of the hems has unraveled."
1.0,"Brassy color, also not sure if this is for a woman or a baby seeing as it runs ridiculously small. Waste of money."
1.0,Ordered the 2 piece set for my daughter but received the nightgown.
1.0,"The dress I received has brown buttons down one side and isn't cute at all. It does not match the dress pictured in the slightest, even the green color is off.  Very frustrating."
1.0,"This mask don‚Äôt protect anyone. You can blow through the mask and see your breath. Trash this product, it‚Äôs useless."
1.0,"I purchased the Atomic English Talking Watch for Seniors with Louder Alarm Clock Visually Impaired because I am visually Impaired.<br />The instructions are in such small print that I cannot read them.<br /><br />AS of now I have not found anyone to read and set the watch for me to use, so I cannot rate my experience with the watch.<br /><br />Honest consumer:"
1.0,Very pretty bracelet but toggle kept slipping out and I lost it several times. Now I‚Äôve lost it permanently. I‚Äôve only had it for two weeks. Spend a little more and get something well made.
1.0,Sleeves were short. Felt like an Iron-On decal on the front. The quality of the material is not good either.
1.0,"Not soft at all, and the material isn't great at all. Not worth this much money..."
1.0,"This dress came to me MUCH too big in the chest and too large in waist even though I gave opted to give the company exact dimensions.  It was scratchy and the color was not like it appears online.  Very disappointed in what was sent to me.  No refund was available either, even though it reads that you can."
1.0,Hated them. Arrived with a hole in them...had to return. Terrible quality and well deserved bad customer appeal!
1.0,Received a size large and it's probably a U.S. women's size 0. I typically wear a 5/6 and there was no way I could button them. Waste of money.
1.0,"It arrived today but doesn‚Äôt even have anything but the bra! No straps, no clear straps or extension! Just the bra... since I‚Äôve ordered the same bra in other colors I‚Äôm waiting to see if they have the same missing items in the package and if so I‚Äôll return them a lo together but, this one is going back!"
1.0,There was a bunch of shattered pieces of glass in the package. I threw the whole thing away bc I don't want to take a chance of a piece getting in my skin. Nothing about the bracelet seemed broken so idk where the glass even came from.
1.0,Cheap gloves. Wore short amount of time and literally failing apart while wearing. Seams coming apart! Terrible product!
1.0,According to the size chart the 3x should have fit me but turns out this outfit is NOT a true 3x more like a regular large. I was so disappointed. Glad I only ordered the one outfit verses the 3 I was going to order.
1.0,This was hideous in person‚Ä¶ returned immediately
1.0,The red stones turned my arm red with some kind of die that was used.
1.0,"Not worth the money. Just a piece of fabric cut on both ends, with raw edges. Would not waste my money on them again. Returned!"
1.0,Thought it was a Clio on
1.0,These rings were poorly made and I could not fit half of them on any fingers. They felt like plastic rings from a toy machine.
1.0,I was very disappointed with this sweatshirt. It is not true to size. A XXL is usually a little big on me and thats the way I like sweatshirts. This one fits like a XL. I will be donating it to the Goodwill. Was a waste of money.
1.0,Pants did not fit like a xxl.
1.0,Got the strap today. Shipment was fast. Strap quality looks good. The problem is that the lock is loose. It just doesn't want to stay however I adjust it. Would retutrn it tomorrow! !!
1.0,It is only 2 months and it started showing sign of low quality. It started loosing the peel and lower part of the shoes. I expected it to at least work for 5 full months!
1.0,I never got it. It said that there was an ingredient that wasn't FDA approved on the US
1.0,[[VIDEOID:737598738066e650d5eb0d579bac9d57]] Only one box had my product!
1.0,This product came to my home in a shrink wrap bag. The wrinkles were so bad I could not possibly give this as a gift. Sadly I ordered three of them. And the sizes run so small none of them fit.
1.0,Horrible!!!! My husband and son broke them trying to get them to fit on teeth don't buy waste of money
1.0,I left the hat in the car to be handy to use.  Now it has lost all it's color.  Waste of my money.
1.0,"I always find REALLY gorgeous clothing on Amazon but the sizes are always too small.<br />I always order size XL or to be safe XXL.<br />Even though the tag on the blouses say XL, it really isn‚Äôt . Perhaps it is in other countries abroad, but definitely not in the US.<br />It is too much trouble to return it so I just donated it instead."
1.0,The back of one of the gauges would not screw off! It is on there so tight and Iv'e tried a million different ways to get it off and have had other people try to unscrew the back but it wont budge. Not happy with this at all! I paid $18 and I can't even wear them!
1.0,The concept is good but sent it back because of the following:<br />1.  Awkward non removable hood<br />2. Bottom Metal zipper keeps hitting shin when walking  zipped
1.0,"Sure, they look nice, but the fit was awful. I could fit my foot in, but there was no way I could walk in them. They were unbearably uncomfortable. They felt like they were made of straight plastic. Maybe they take some breaking in, but I would not recommend these shoes to anyone."
1.0,"I love the dress , I just need a bigger size."
1.0,poorly constructed. painted not enameled.
1.0,"I've only worn the shirt a few times, the lettering/design is peeling off"
1.0,"Ordered 2XL...it fits my tiny 98lb daughter!! I am 5'4"" and 180lbs. Way way way too small around waist and very short!"
1.0,Very thin n cheap. One wash n it fell apart at the bottom
1.0,Dress was damaged  :(
1.0,Ordered an XL ended up having to give them to my daughter who wears medium.
1.0,This was the worst Amazon product I have received. It looks nothing like the pictures and has no structure. Looked like I was wearing a paper bag.
1.0,"Dress did not look like the picture. Sleeves were 3/4 length, color was dull not bright or vibrant."
1.0,"Three shirts, all marked 3 xlt. Navy shirt looks like someone stretched the neck out of shape and after washing, still out of shape. This one fit. The other two were more like an xl and are real short. My son is 6-5 so total waste of money."
1.0,"While my daughter loves the fit, after two washes the vampire diaries logo is barely distinguishable. Not worth buying."
1.0,"I returned this item. There were seams that weren't closed, black smudge stains and it was oddly shaped. it did not fit like in the picture.  The worst thing of all is that it came in the wrong freaking color! I will never purchase anything from this vendor again."
1.0,"I received these and the post separated from the earring when I first took them out of the package.  I did receive a prompt refund when I returned the items to the drop off point (this surprised me as I figured I would have to wait until Amazon got the earrings back), but ended up not having the accessories I wanted for a Mardi Gras event."
1.0,"I received only the sandals without any instructions or the unit that should come with it. No one responded to my email either, so I can't give you a good review"
1.0,This product is a perfect example of you get what you pay for. The material is completely see through. It‚Äôs cheaply made and poor quality. Not wearable.
1.0,I had high hopes for these! cheaply made broke easily.
1.0,This was a joke! Could've fit an 8 yr old not a grown women
1.0,"Save your money, awful material and very unflattering, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 125lbs but made me feel so uncomfortable with my body :( I wanted to love these, but couldn‚Äôt"
1.0,The material was see thru flimsy cheap material.
1.0,"Chrysoprase?  Really???  Color is not consistent with authentic stone, Chrysoprase."
1.0,"Cute outfit, but this product runs WAY too small. Very disappointed."
1.0,This necklace is not even adult size. It doesn't even fit around my neck. The pendant is smaller than in the description. Wouldn't recommend at all.
1.0,La talla no es la esperada
1.0,Material is very poor/cheep. Maybe a good fit if you were doing costumes for a part.
1.0,"Cheap quality, look very different in picture"
1.0,COULD NOT OPEN NECKLACE....
1.0,"I should have listened to the reviews.  These are horrible.  They do not hold hair well.  These feel like there made of thin paper, also see through material.  Short strings when attempting to tie the strings as well.  I do not recommend especially for the price! Avoid trust me.  I wish I would have listened to the reviews."
1.0,The problem with these belts is the clasp that determines the length of the belt. It pokes out and slips above my jeans where it scratches my back. Very uncomfortable. I solved the problem by flipping the belt so it faces out but can only do that with shirts that don't tuck.
1.0,"Just not enough information to set the time , I still haven't set the time. Not worth the money"
1.0,Clasp doesn‚Äôt lock
1.0,My son put it on one time and the material started to lose its stitches. Luckily he only had to wear it for about 15 min.  Unsatisfied.
1.0,"Buying this, you would think you are indeed getting a cheaper smartwatch for your child, with which you can connect with her. No. It's got no SIM card slot, so it won't make calls...<br /><br />But what does it do?<br /><br />Not much... A few extremely simple and clumsy games (who would need those?) and a pedometer that is even mentioned in the product leaflet as not being serious and made ""for fun"" only.<br /><br />I am left staring at this thing wondering how my child can ever use it for anything...<br /><br />It could simply say ""smartwatch-like toy for children"" in the title and I wouldn't bother buying it."
1.0,Keep your dollar.  This brike the moment i put it on. The bracelet could of come out if a gumball machine .
1.0,Fit was all wrong. The bra part was for someone with a c cup or smaller. Wouldn't recommend this suite.
1.0,It's been folded so long in transit that we can't get the creases out.  The plastic shield is just held on by ties that you tie in the back and it doesn't stay on.<br /><br />A big pain in the booty.
1.0,"I am super bummed about this dress.  I was so excited to wear this when it came, I wore it that same day.  I was out and about and I glanced down and noticed that the black color was streaking into the red...how embarrassing! The color had basically ran into the red and it looked like the left side of my chest was all smeared.  Ugh.  I tried to contact the seller to resolve but I have not heard back.  This is not a dress I will ever wear again.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my unbiased and 100% honest review and I would not recommend this."
1.0,"Button holes were far too small for the buttons. It's also not as heavy as I had anticipated. Returning for a refund, but that doesn't help for this weekend."
1.0,The skirt was not properly or completely sewn to the top of the dress. There are holes and string showing at the seam. The dress is currently unwearable.
1.0,It is all twisted together and looks nothing like this.  DON&#34;T WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS IS JUNK!!!!!!
1.0,Material was not what I expected and fit was tight even using the size guide
1.0,"I was so excited for this purse holder/organizer, but my excitement didn‚Äôt last very long. I‚Äôve only had this for about a little over a month and already 4 of the clips have broken off. The bags that it shows that they carry are way bigger than mine and even then the clips didn‚Äôt last. The concept of this was great and very easy to use but also very cheaply made and not worth it."
1.0,Disappointed.  Order this thinking it had red north face on front.  Showed up with white print.  Specifically ordered it for the red north face.
1.0,The dress is great to lounge in. The color is more of a lilac color. It looks as if the fabric was washed with purple clothing.
1.0,This dress material was bulky and the material was not flattering. Not at all what I expected. Returned.
1.0,"It smells so bad of mildew I had it put it out on the picnic table outside, Will try to let her out a few days and wait with disinfectant. Very disappointing You people should know better than send stuff out like that"
1.0,"I purchased a pair of these slippers 15 years ago.  Best ever!  I ordered a new pair last year.  After 5 wears the upper was already separating from the sole.  In the pic from 2004, the upper was sown to the sole, in the 2019 photo they're glued.  Based on the first purchase, I expected a lot from these slippers but Woolrich let me down."
1.0,"Do not waste your money.  First off, it isn‚Äôt sterling silver.  It tarnished and broke within 3 days of wearing. Plus, it wasn‚Äôt what the picture showed."
1.0,Disappointed to receive a product that had been used.  The tags were no longer attached and there is a clear black stain on the fabric.  Will be returning this product.
1.0,"Not happy, came with a set of the same earring. :/"
1.0,Became tarnished almost immediately after fitting. Lost most of the gold with only some odd white color remaining after 1 night.
1.0,Doesn't fit. It's rubber. It won't stretch the ear well.
1.0,I purchased the navy dress and it was see through. Just wasn't flattering for me so I returned it.
1.0,Terrible slippers. I have had for 3 months and now are garbage. Save your money !!
1.0,Sin calidad..!!!!
1.0,Greasy black stain puckish discolored same place as green
1.0,Wouldnt mold to teeth
1.0,Was shorty made and bigger than expected
1.0,Can't get over chest size is right material is not flexible
1.0,Bad very bad waste of money no came all deformed
1.0,"This mask looks nothing like the picture. It actually is quite comfortable but looks like a white tie dyed material. My wife asked me what it was. Not to mention, I actually do have a white, short beard myself. Very disappointed. On the bright side, I could wear this after Christmas very easily because it certainly doesn‚Äôt look like Santa."
1.0,El dije me agrado.la cadena de muy mala calidad
1.0,I had ordered these way before Christmas and had to have them resent due to being lost and then the second delivery was delayed trying to talk to someone was like pulling teeth and were not willing to compromise to help me. Very disappointed
1.0,"I give them one star, only because zero isn't possible. They are VERY poorly made. The lenses are cheap plastic, that are not of optical quality. They can't be clearly focused for distance or close up. My grandson has toy binoculars that are better made, and with higher magnification. I saw them on TV, and they seemed impressive. It just didn't click, until I had placed the order, that the impressive sounding 400% magnification is only 4x. Sports binoculars are 7x-10x, and can go much higher in power for tripod mounted. Don't waste your money on this junk!"
1.0,"First, the sole is hard as a rock, I don't think it had any bend or give to it at all.  No child should be wearing such hard soled shoes. Second, the canvas heal area chafes terribly -- it's rough with stitching and very stiff.  they look good, but not wearable."
1.0,It‚Äôs too hard to fit on and they rip after the first use
1.0,"Bought this set to take on holiday.  By the time I got to the gate, the purse (which only had my passport and boarding pass) had split.  By the time I got to my destination, the zipper on the bag had fallen off and the rope on the purse was all frayed.  After 1-day on the beach, the bag had a hole in it.  I ended up having to buy a new bag while I was away.  A shame since the bag looks lovely.  But a total waste of money.  I'll even avoid this company in the future"
1.0,Not what I thought it was.
1.0,Too small. 3xl is not plus size. Innacurate color and slits on the racerback. I was looking forward to more purchases but I'm guessing after my initial thoughts I am very displeased with this tank.
1.0,Cute hat but the way they package and ship it ruins it.  It‚Äôs folded over and stays that way when removed from package.
1.0,doesn't fit right.. The top is cut funny.
1.0,First time I washed a sweater it filled up really bad I won‚Äôt even wear it anymore
1.0,This is not well made!
1.0,These shoes are complete trash. Got then for my little brother. The leds went out in 3days.
1.0,RECEIVED TIS ITEM AND ITS &#34;NOTHING&#34; LIKE THE PICTURE.  I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I WILL BE SUBMITTING AN A-Z CLAIM!!
1.0,Very cheat and poor quality.  Product not as it appeared. Horrible purchase.
1.0,"If you don't have a torso, purchase away! Other than that, don't waste your money. It fits oddly. I ordered a large and it fit like a small. I honestly don't even know if ordering a larger size would help since the torso is so short. I returned this item."
1.0,Tiene buena tela y el tallaje est√° bien lo √∫nico que no me mandaron el color que hab√≠a pedido
1.0,brought after adjusting the chain to my neck.
1.0,Arrived with a small hole in the front of it!  Fabric VERY thin!
1.0,Don't buy it you'll be disappointed
1.0,Put this skirt on and the belt loop was broken. Returned. It was also kind of scratchy material so I probably would have returned it anyways.
1.0,Very poor quality and workmanship!
1.0,"Very disappointed with the horrible quality of these shoes. The cats printed on each shoe were different sizes and one cat was placed completely crooked so it's ears were cut off. The quality of the shoe itself was also poor. The material is thin, not durable and the shape is overly rounded, almost fake looking."
1.0,Mask aren‚Äôt breathable as described. Received yesterday and wore one today and I‚Äôm dying. I ordered the large and they‚Äôre huge and the only way I can keep on my face is place strap around my ears. I have them adjusted all the way and it falls off my face. Will be returning.
1.0,"This product does not look the way it does on the website. I thought it was a push bra from the looks of the photo, bit it is not"
1.0,Round the edge of these rings is a copper color I don't like that at all it makes some look very cheap
1.0,Didn't care for the plastic accessory buckle
1.0,Not adhesive at all. I'm a DD and it definitely does not work for me. Wouldn't recommend for the bigger ta that's.
1.0,I would like to get a left earring<br />They are beautiful but I cannot wear them
1.0,Arrived BROKEN
1.0,I normally love pattys clothes but this is by far the worst shirt i ever got from them. Way too bug baggy poor shape just an all around ugly shaped shirt. Dont buy it
1.0,Fell apart after one day
1.0,It was definitely for fashion only!
1.0,"UPDATE: FELL APART AT THE TOE AFTER THE 10TH TIME WORN. DO NOT BUY!<br /><br />I bought this in a half size up because I like wearing thicker socks, and I still have room. These are really cute, I've tried them on but have not worn them yet because it's too warm. So far, I like the way they fit. Great amount of wood and perfect for people with muscular calves.<br /><br />UPDATE: FELL APART AT THE TOE AFTER THE 10TH TIME WORN. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,Needed a mask for work. This served the purpose! Got a few compliments!
1.0,Poor quality all the way around. Cheap looking. Would not recommend to anyone
1.0,The size is very small  if you return get postage paid they gave me return for me to pay
1.0,Quality was somewhat good but the chain stunk after a few wears.
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes larger than normal and they are about 2 sizes too small. üòû
1.0,Should‚Äôve read the reviews before purchasing however it didn‚Äôt occur to me to do so. It is not real silver and I am allergic to multiple types of metal so that‚Äôs not good. It also turned my finger green and tarnishes after just a few days.... and no it wasn‚Äôt wet !
1.0,"This dress was not comfortable at all. I was hoping to use it for a bachelorette party but this was terrible as soon as I put it on. It felt like a shapeless mumu with weird frills. I ordered an XL since Amazon suggested it and so did the sizing chart but I could have ordered much smaller. I still wouldn‚Äôt have liked it though. The inside elastic is scratchy and uncomfortable. If I lifted my arms, the elastic jumped over the top of my boobs and didn‚Äôt go back down when I put my arms down. So basically can‚Äôt wear unless I‚Äôm going to keep my arms down or constantly tug at my dress to keep it in the appropriate location. One perk - it does have pockets.<br /><br />Definitely not for me, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this dress."
1.0,"I am starting a new (powerful pepper) company and every penny counts, so it was an unpleasant surprise to receive this crappy hat rack. It doesn't hold hats well and it tilts the hats forward just waiting for a bump so it can drop the hats. It is hard to get the hats in and they have to balance on two thin rails. The hats have to be open, which is difficult with brand new hats and it will not be coming with me to any of my upcoming events. This item can be found for 18.99 on other websites as well."
1.0,"Absolutely a very cheap quality product , I regret every purchasing these glasses,  The lenses are very cloudy and you see through it like there's a fog outside every time you wear it..  Bad product.. It would be better to buy this at Walmart or some other store..  And it took me three weeks to get it.."
1.0,"Me enviaron una talla incorrecta, ped√≠ M y me enviaron 3X."
1.0,"I purchased this item for my teen boys hair. It‚Äôs course, thick, and curly.  This did nothing for his hair. It didn‚Äôt straighten or help. I even tried without the guard.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this.  The only positive about this is that it heats up quick and it‚Äôs light weight. Our next item will be an actual hot comb."
1.0,"This swimsuit looked super cute on the website but i was upset when i got it. My measurements are 36DD, 30, 38... the bust was too small, the rest of it was too big and loose, and the skirt was really short in the back. I had really high hopes for it but i am sending it back for a return."
1.0,This scarf is not worth a nickel.... it is not like described at all... totally not satisfied
1.0,Very disappointed. Ordered a size that should of been a perfect fit and was way too small that I could not even get it on. I ordered a black and white colors. Colors are great. NEGATIVE 5 star for receiving the black sports bra that was previously tried on or worn by someone because it had white marks on it.
1.0,"Took over a month to get here since it's coming from Malaysia (I'm in Florida). The scarf smells terrible and is much thinner than anticipated. It can solely be used for decoration, not for keeping warm as indicated in the description.The cats are NOT as clear as depicted in the picture. They are a bit stretched out and look more like Halloween cats, like they're scared or angry. I also did not receive the keyring that was supposed to be included!"
1.0,Lasted two days then the glass broke. It's already in the trash.
1.0,The pattern and cut are attractive but the plasticy fabric is what you'd expect from a cheap tablecloth at a kid's birthday party. Doesn't hang or move nicely and I can't imagine it being comfortable in warm weather.
1.0,i ask for large and got a medium love the dress. Very disappointed. i had to return.
1.0,this is an ugly sweater pattern printed on a sweatshirt.  I'd give it 0 stars if I could due to misleading advertising.  Completely disappointed when it arrived and couldn't return it fast enough.  Save your money.  This is a rip off.
1.0,"Weird fit. Too tight in the crotch and yet too long in the legs, and weirdly loose in the middle. I would rather have loose all around, like a dress only a skort. Anything that crams up in my crotch no matter how I adjust it (if I loosened the top straps, the sides fell so low it showed my underwear) is not for me. What happened to old-fashioned loose overalls we could just cut off??? That's what we did when I was a kid."
1.0,"Nice appearance, but the toes are wearing through after one month of wear. No one ENJOYS buying socks so it's far nicer to have them last a year at least. These won't."
1.0,Reconsider
1.0,Had to throw a few away as they were not wearable. Almost like they were made for stretched lobes
1.0,"Bought these for Christmas party but they were wrong color, nothing like the picture they are orange and white, not even close to red!"
1.0,This is a dress for a teenager and not for a woman - it is so short that you would have to be careful bending or sitting.  The fabric is not as shown  - the color is more coral than red.  And the dress is very short waisted.  Sent it back.
1.0,"Cheap material, cheap zippers..<br />Plugged in a fully charged battery and after 15 minutes on high, I couldn't feel that the heating device was hardly making any heat..<br /><br />I'd honestly say find another vest, this one really sucks..<br /><br />Ima send this one back and find a better one, myself"
1.0,"There is no way these are real stones.  They look like plastic beads -- not true to the stones in the picture at all.  The silver-colored piece is really cheap too.  It is hollowed out, so it is not very solid at all.  I guess I shouldn't have expected much for the price, but the pendant is still really disappointing.  After reading the other reviews I knew it was going to be rather large, which it is.  I was going to make into a key chain and give it to a friend as a gift, but not now.  Looks like I bought it from the dollar store.<br />**I bought this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.**"
1.0,Dislike item.
1.0,Just wore this dress for the first time a week ago.  I washed according to the instructions.  It shrank....a lot.  I am sad because it is past the time I could return it.  I loved it the first and only time I will get to wear it!
1.0,This ran super small. Ordered a XL and it looked more like a small. Returned
1.0,They were way too big and not anything like I expected
1.0,This is super cheap halloween costume like material that has no weight to it at all and just doesn't sit right and keeps sliding up. The belt won't even stay in place because the fabric is so slippery and thin. Came with a ton of loose threads hanging off. Returning.
1.0,"Say to big and floppy even at the right size, they stretch and move to much. It would be better if they came with a band around them to hold in place"
1.0,its not working
1.0,I was delivered the wrong shoe!
1.0,This is a beautiful ring. Very rich looking but poorly made. I wore this ring once and a stone fell out. I‚Äôm returning it to the manufacturer
1.0,"These are too big and obtrusive, looks bad"
1.0,I would not purchase these again. They aren‚Äôt the sport like fabric they are comparable to colored panty hose to wear on your arms. I‚Äôm not sure how they would provide any protection from the Sun or anything for that matter. I purchased a different brand on Amazon that we are very happy with and these went in the trash.
1.0,"This outfit is deceiving! Cute but not true to size at all. The material looks very cute in pictures, but it's paper thin. And the top is way too small and the skirt to long. This had no good Porpotion! I was dissapointed in the product, but the service was great they refunded me back immediately as soon as I told them."
1.0,"I didn't  give these leggings five stars because as soon as I put them on they got a run in them like pantyhose get runs in them.  I purashed two pair and both got runs in them...one pair my dautgher tried on and the other pair i tried on and they both ran....I am very disappointed, I really like the leggings and I really would like to wear them but I can't walk around with runs in the back as it may continue to run and in other places ....I would not recommend these leggings...wasted money, I don't think I can send back due to covid...so I'm stuck with them and I can't war them....so I advise u not to purchase...I have no way of a refund."
1.0,"Ordered a 3x so it would be baggy and loose, but it's tight and short"
1.0,All different sizes
1.0,Poorly designed. Several people said they didn't like the fit.  Even heard someone say it looks like Shaquille O'Neal sweats with arms.
1.0,Item was broken when I received it. Missing parts.
1.0,Use it all at first or it will spray only droplets after several months. I bought my third pair of Timberland boots over the weekend.  I had 3/4 bottle of Timberland Balm Protector XL All Purpose Protector on the shelf. I had it for several months and all it would spray was droplets on my new Timberland Pro work boots. Be careful and use it quick.
1.0,"Very nice looking.. from a distance. Straight out of the box, there are scuffs and scratches on the band that would usually show up after months of wear and tear. The watch itself seems to be pretty decent. The band is awful. The inserts seem to be cheap plastic, it was very difficult (compared to other watches) to remove the pins to shorten the band length. The tool provided was very cheap and broke as soon as I even thought about maybe taking a quick glance at it. Had to use a tool provided with a 7 dollar stainless steel band for my smart watch. It worked great, but with how flimsy the band is, it still took some foul language and many tries to finally succeed. Ah, the things men do for women! I'm not sure how well it keeps time as it's nearly impossible to set and it is hours off. Luckily for my lady, it's more of a fashion statement than a timepiece. Sometimes you can find a gem watch in a mushroom brand. Affordable, decent quality, flashy, comfortable. That's what this one isn't! Well, flashy maybe, if you're far enough away. I think this watch/company doesn't even deserve one star, but it made the ol' lady happy so I guess that's what really matters. Still got her an Invicta because she deserves quality and even tho she likes this one i felt the need to make it up to her. So if you're into overpaying for a cheap, Chinese hand-crapped on beautiful watch that looks like it has been used an abused for months, then this is the watch for you! UPDATE: Had the watch set correctly. It holds time great!!... for about 2 hours, then it's game over. Time to reset, rewind, and wonder why one would have to wind an automatic watch about every couple hours!"
1.0,This was a disappointing buy! They are so cheap and flimsy! I broke one as soon as I opened the package! And I broke more by simply readjusting the size! The edges are sharp and they turn your toes green! Never buying from this manufacturer again!
1.0,Sorry...I gave it a 1...though I really like the Christmas colors and design..the earrings are very heavy...I kept the pendant.
1.0,"Unfortunately, these slippers were just too hard and not very glexible for my little one."
1.0,"Knock off shoes. Terrible tread, doesn't fit snugly to feet. Only good for walking around, not running."
1.0,They rust and turns tarnished I wish they had it where you could put no starts
1.0,I've had these boots for about 2 months and the sole on right shoe has a huge hole. Quality not what I had hoped.
1.0,"Material flimsy, button holes too tight to open and close and sewing poor.  Items were returned."
1.0,"This product is obviously not really ""DKNY"".<br />Finger tips unraveled in just a couple days. Very cheap material.<br />FAKE!!!!  FAKE!!!  FAKE!!!"
1.0,Decent quality for the price but runs very small
1.0,I am usually a size Medium (8-10) and ordered a Large from previous reviews and it was still so small. The shorts were awful and the shirt was basically a crop top. Ended up giving them to good will.
1.0,"Nope. I have tried this dieting. I have tried it not dieting. While dieting, my results were no more impressive than what I was already accomplishing. While not dieting, I got zero results. Now, a short time after purchase (but long enough not to be returnable) one of the ice bags has a leak. So, even just the idea that I could at least use it to keep cool in the summer goes out the window. Very disappointed."
1.0,This sweater got a snag at the tiniest touch. So sad.
1.0,Cheap looking. Returned to Amazon.
1.0,When you initially wear the pants they are great. And the longer you have them on the bigger the pants get. Just aweful
1.0,I'm very upset because they did not indicate on the website that this was a kids t-shirt the way they wrote Medium as if it was for a man didn't say that it was for a child and I brought this for my husband for his birthday he can't even wear that.. they need to be more accurate on the size and inform people that it's a kids t-shirt!
1.0,"It is legit cardboard on a headband hot glued, flimsy and falls off if u touch it"
1.0,Very poor quality construction and fabric as compared to original one I purchased.
1.0,Had it like three weeks and it broke.
1.0,Cheap feeling material
1.0,The hearts are too big for pendant as well as the earrings. Be careful about the size before purchasing.
1.0,Fits fine but it's very pink and the flowers are bright red. The &quot;lace&quot; is awful. I'll never wear this top. It doesn't look anything like the picture.
1.0,I wear L-XL tops and ordered an XL. It‚Äôs HUGE! It looks like a night gown and is of terrible quality. The slits in the sleeves look like someone just cut them witch scissors. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,I‚Äôve seen dollar store umbrellas and origami more wind proof
1.0,Peque√±o talla7 y compre talla XL(14-16)<br />Deseo cambiarlo
1.0,Never been so disappointed in a purchase. This is not the description provided.
1.0,Was able to wear this 1 day. Got super tangly in my jewelry box overnight. Untangled it then broke by lunch time.
1.0,These are so terrible! I wish I would have taken photos before I sent them back but I didn't. They were all tarnished and discolored.
1.0,"recv'd item  but is DIFFERENT from the picture shown- also item arrived all wrinkled up , looking old and worn due to the very small clear plastic baggies it was shipped in and a label on the outside of the bag- very unprofessional way to ship items- item has a smell to it- unsure if rec'vd worn item and/or returned item- for the quality of the item , it is  overpriced for the poor  workmanship due to cheap looking materials used-"
1.0,"We bought the slippers to use at home for cold winters and such. After wearing them around for a couple days, the outside began to split from the sole. The sole and the outside are held together by a single thread on both slippers which frays and begins to come apart quickly. The pictures I took show this thread on the outside of the slipper."
1.0,The color rubbed off in a few days and looked aweful.
1.0,"These white gloves barely meet the criteria to be called a glove, yes they are fabric that you can put your hand in and they are white but these gloves are cheap and useless."
1.0,"I'm 5'6"" and this was still plenty long, came right below my knee. The stomach area was really large, perfect for maternity, but with my shape, not flattering."
1.0,Too small for my tragus piercing
1.0,Broke within the first hour of wear for no reason. I knew it would be cheap just didn't expect it to completley fall apart. Looked great though.
1.0,It's says XL but the shirts I got were 3XL
1.0,"Horrible!  Came directly from China and when I opened the container and took them out, they fell apart and couldn't be fixed.<br />Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Forget it!"
1.0,"I bought this top with high hopes and while the fit was ok, this was very cheaply made.  The material was very thin and the design was more like an iron on.  I have never worn it."
1.0,would not recommend they come apart very easy the ball gets lost have to keep replacing. not a good buy at all.
1.0,"Was going to order until I saw the crack user's 1"" knarly thumb nail in the product demo picture."
1.0,Ordered a 4xl and its for a small child
1.0,My band broke and just received it a week a go.
1.0,"I bought the B-Red it arrived today, it‚Äôs pumpkin ORANGE! Not RED! The picture displayed looks like denim, it‚Äôs fleece. The product is a lie!!!! Also displays moose knuckle.. just a warning for you meaty people."
1.0,"Ordered this as a black vest. It is NOT black, it's  100% navy blue. I was very disappointed as I didn't have time to order another vest so I had to not use it. False advertising and I wasted my money. Look at the picture. It's the vest next to a black material so you can see the difference."
1.0,The ‚Äúbow tie‚Äù was made of wood. I was not expecting a wood tie. I wanted a cloth bow tie. If wood was in the description it was not prominently stated.
1.0,"Little baby boy wrist sized.  If you have micro wrist A+<br /><br />otherwise, nah"
1.0,Too small around the bottom area but I have a big bottom. The quality was really really poor :/
1.0,The charm broke off when I put the necklace on for the first time.
1.0,Details did not indicate the size I thought I ordered.
1.0,The photo was taken with the light button pressed. The digital display is too dark and not visible until the light button is pressed.
1.0,There seems to be too much fabric to gather around the neckline.
1.0,Very cheaply made and only worn three times and they broke! Never Again!!!
1.0,It turned black immediately
1.0,Not like the picture. The tie came right across the boobs; over my nipples. Horrible stitching.
1.0,"BEWARE! I did NOT receive what was pictured at all! I was expecting a pretty hot pink midi length dress, and instead I received a pink t-shirt that goes to mid-thigh! Completely different and extremely disappointing! I had the package delivered to my mom's while I was at work, so my cousin actually tried on this &#34;elegant swing dress&#34; and you can see by the attached picture that it is basically a semi-long t-shirt with bat wings in a different color pink. (Sorry for the poor quality pictures, my mom has not upgraded to a smart phone yet, but you get the idea!) I immediately requested a return through Amazon. The dress pictured has panels down the front, fitted sleeves and fitted top, with a length down to mid-calf. What I received had no panels, bat wing sleeves, no fitted portions at all, and length to mid-thigh. Definitely not worth $25."
1.0,Did not fit AT ALL.
1.0,"For the price I was anticipating a piece of finer jewelry; however, when it arrived the pendent was completely cheap plastic.  There was no sterling silver and no bamboo inlay.  Extremely disappointed!"
1.0,Could not get these to fit.  Pin is too long.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"This dress is a completely different color than advertised, is incredibly tight even though it is listed as an XL, and the seams are undone on the exterior of the dress. Completely ridiculous. Do NOT buy."
1.0,The material was too itchy for me.
1.0,Runs small. Looks and feels cheap. Color does not look like picture. Do not buy.
1.0,Requires a minimum of strength in the hands. Does not open wide enough so it is hard to put into place
1.0,These are huge. To big
1.0,Bracelet and charms are too bulky.
1.0,"I should have returned them. My sister wore one. It's too tight too hot and only two received. Almost $16 for 2 pieces of crap. Awaiting bandanas now bought elsewhere due to faster shipping. Amazon, step up. Masks are required in certain areas. Should be 2 day shipping but not available on any."
1.0,"Horrible, it was a dull orange red not a silky rich red as shown, with a big open weave. I didn't even take it out of the packet before returning it!"
1.0,Omg do not buy this jumper. It is just a knock off of the picture listed. I put it on and died laughing because i felt like i was wearing a dance costume from when i was 10. The fabric is horrible. Please do not buy you will be so disappointed...thank god for free returns!!!
1.0,returned this item. Was too small and poor condition
1.0,"The elbow patches don't line up anywhere near your elbows.  They end up on top of your arm.  Sad, shirt fits well but this makes it unwearable."
1.0,It was the right size for my waist but the inseam in the crotch was waaay to small and the pants were very long too.
1.0,Ordered a child size 1 and got adult size 4 with the size crossed out with a sharpie. Shoe was huge...VERY wide. I did use their sizing chart before ordering.  Will be returning.
1.0,The only reason I give one star is it came on time dress is horrible doesn‚Äôt look like picture no pockets I‚Äôm not sure I Evan got the right dress so disappointed
1.0,Soon as we took it out of the package and out it in it broke in half like cheap old metal.
1.0,I'm 5'5&#34; and this swimsuit would be good for someone maybe 5' tall. Or if you only want your nipples covered. I'm normally a size large and I ordered up a size because a lot of reviews stated the suit was small. Still didn't work. I ended up returning immediately.
1.0,Really TOO SMALL!
1.0,Always getting caught on things
1.0,Why did I get a red shirt with orange suspenders...
1.0,Terrible! Do not buy! I‚Äôve only wore it once and the top part of it broke off and it spilled everywhere. Horrifying experience to have your lost one spilled everywhere on you.
1.0,Poor quality and after a few months it starts to split and the leather begins to curls and split apart.
1.0,"These cannot be leather. I wore the black one twice and it looks worn & awful already. Very cheap, guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,I ordered size up with the largest size going off the size chart but they came extra small. I could barely get on it was so small. Don‚Äôt bother ordering unless you are a size 0.
1.0,"Do not buy this product. It took over a month to receive. When I finally got it, one of the bands was sewn incorrectly. They refused to pay to ship them back."
1.0,"poor quality, i know it's cheap but still it doesn't spin. It barely moves."
1.0,Thought this dress would be more dressy. It‚Äôs like a Jersey material and looks cheap.
1.0,Lasted an hour! Fell apart on the girls heads
1.0,"The sizing wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to correct size.  It was suppose to be a large kids, it would probably fit a 2 year old.  I love the item and thought my frog loving grandchildren would like wearing sweatshirt, very disappointed I could not give this to them for Christmas."
1.0,"I'll never buy another cap or hat from Amazon again. This is falsely advertised as a &#34;linen&#34; cap. It is 65% polyester and 35% cotton (man, it must be cheap cotton. This cap is worth about 35cents. We burst out laughing when I opened the package. I cannot imagine anyone anywhere wearing such a cheap piece of....&#34;merchandise.&#34; Looks and feels like...nevermind. And who has a head this small? Maybe a 6 year-old kid.[[ASIN:B01B4AGFQW IL Caldo Unisex Spring & Summer Newsboy Cap New Classic breathable Outdoor Linen beret hat,Beige]]"
1.0,This is Very poorly made
1.0,I got this for my daughter to wear to the beach.  She said it was so ugly she could not wear it and would feel badly giving it to someone.  It looks cheap and almost laughable.  I hope the designer was punished.
1.0,Wrist band is to short. Had to put on the side.
1.0,"Cheap material,to short is not what the picture shows ,the picture shows a longer length,at this point It will be hard to trust the clothes that are sold in Amazon"
1.0,"Sadly, this package arrived damage and the brief return window has closed. Disappointed."
1.0,":-/ I suppose they are OK. I bought these as a gift for my SIL who spends her whole work day on her feet and suffers from varicose veins. I thought some fun polka dot socks might brighten her day. I received white socks with blue and green stripes. (not nearly as fun). I gave them to her and I am interested to hear if they help, but I am very disappointed they are not what I ordered."
1.0,Poor quality and a waste of money! Planning to return it.
1.0,"After wearing this bathing suit once it ripped in 3 different places, horrible quality DO NOT BUY"
1.0,"What a joke, they are not even close to the photo...  Yes, they were cheap, but I still expected them to look somewhat like the image....<br /><br />Issues.<br />1. The buckles are not a separate piece of material as shown, at best they are a screen print on the cheap material of the shoe cover.<br />2. The buckle strap doesn't exist, there isn't even one screen printed on the shoe cover.<br />3. The purple of the buckle is so dark that depending on the angle you are looking at the shoe cover, you can hardly tell one is there.<br />4. The &#34;witch point&#34; at the tip of the show cover does NOT curve up.<br />5. Even the photo on the package is not even close to looking like the shoe cover inside.<br /><br />These could have been so cute had they even looked 50% like the photo...<br /><br />Complete waste of $3 (even with free prime shipping)"
1.0,I didn‚Äôt Get the ring
1.0,This scratches as you spread it to put on
1.0,I wouldn't purchase these again. They rust easily.
1.0,"Way, way big and too late to send back"
1.0,Poor Quality no case not like the picture
1.0,"Although these are cute and appealing to kids, they are not very functional. The adhesive was minimal. Within a few minutes of opening the package, my daughter dropped them on the floor and almost all of the earrings fell off of the sheet and onto the floor. After picking them all up,  I noticed there was almost no adhesive on them and wouldn't stick (to the plastic sheet they came on let alone to an ear). Don't waste your money on this product!"
1.0,"This was a waste of money.  For the price, I assumed that this would be at least a high quality synthetic charmeuse. It was not luxurious at all.  The robe is worth about $20.00.<br /><br />Also, the style is very straight and therefore not flowy .  The length is not ""sexy"" it is too long to be a short robe and too short to be a mid length.  Better to spend more and buy silk."
1.0,Not comfortable at all they fit weird
1.0,The zipper kept sepperating and all I had was cards and thin phone. I would not recommend this product
1.0,"I bought this for my friend for her birthday. I got it on time, but when I got it, the necklaces weren't even in a layer. It was a mess and only because it was so cheap I'm not even going to bother returning it."
1.0,I thought when I ordered this shirt I was going 2 love it but I didn't.  I always read the material 2 make sure it will fit right. Well the picture on the shirt and the coloring was exactly what I thought it would be but it just didn't fit the way I wanted it 2. The sizing was not accurate and was disappointing so I had 2 return the shirt.
1.0,"See through, returned"
1.0,The largest size offered here is more of a kids med or large. I didn‚Äôt even try to put them on Because it was a joke to think I could.
1.0,It is too large for a Vivoactive 3.  It keeps falling off every time I take the watch off.  Not like the original at all.
1.0,I can't put them on. The instep is too stiff.  If I order a larger size they will be too big to walk in.
1.0,I ordered the large size stated for 8-14year old. Too small for a 11 year old male. Wanted to return but due to the virus just ate the lost
1.0,Good fit but does not value the money....as sweat is not enough.  The material is not as hot as needed...I have an Everlast belt which is very good. I wanted to try one that covers more but had not good results with this one.
1.0,A million small buttons that are very time intensive. Even when buttoned up there is a gap between each button revealing skin underneath. Not practical for many reasons. I don‚Äôt plan to wear it at all.
1.0,"I was so disappointed in these pants. The fabric is just gross- it's that thick textured polyester that your great grandmas elastic nursing home pants are made of.<br />And the tie only is for the front half?  It looks so weird.<br />I don't like dramatic negative reviews, but I'd never be caught out in public wearing these pants.  Ever."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt fit and very dull gold. Returning
1.0,"Please do not buy , they need to change the name to knee highs instead"
1.0,I received an empty package .
1.0,Product came damaged and the jacket was like a child large! Would no recommend this outfit to anyone! The material is cheap.
1.0,"Bought a 3X because I like them baggy, thus 3X was MAYBE an XL."
1.0,"piece of crap. some bands do barely glow, others are brighter. do not stay on your leg while running"
1.0,Not true to size. Flannel thin. Nothing like the flannel that I'm used to. There is a hole where the right sleeve meets the body of the gown at the shoulder. Noticed it before I even tried it on. Bad sewing!  Product made in China. Would have never bought this if I saw it at a store.  Do not buy this product.
1.0,It works as it should and looks cool but it only came with one hand..
1.0,bad quality too big end different color ;(
1.0,Item looks old and rusted.
1.0,it great did rip at all tested it out for a while 8 hrs for 3 days
1.0,No way this was 3x
1.0,This bracket arrived broken. The leather bands were not attached properly so the bracelet does not wrap around the wrist properly.
1.0,Way too big and Is made by some odd plastic material that is very thin. Did not look good
1.0,"I definitely wouldn't describe these as ""compression""  or long. I won't be ordering more because they ride up when I sit down or bend over. I will be using them as a barrier layer under my waist trainer. I wore one for an entire day so now I can't return them but I really wish I could."
1.0,Wore this during the day maybe 4 times before the stone fell kut
1.0,"This dress will rip/tear on the first wash. So<br />Sad, such a nice style. What a waste of money."
1.0,This was broken when it arrived. Couldn't open it  so it was junk.
1.0,"dollar store product, very disappointed with a cheap product"
1.0,They have a funky smell to them and some of the masks had the metal that bends around the nose sticking out of the mask and poking my face. Wouldn't buy again.
1.0,Buyer beware.! These are not the size I the description...smaller that 1/5 inch! These are more appropriate for a child than an adult.
1.0,"So, below is my first review, but I am changing my rating from 3 to 1 because today (after wearing them about 4 times) I noticed the threads that hold the thin sole on are pulling out.  I guess I will only be able to wear them a few more times before they hit the trash.  Such a waste of money.<br />--------------------<br /><br />Ok, but the sole was much thinner than expected.  Plus they kept falling off my feet when wearing them.  To keep them on I had to wear them INSIDE my slippers.  Kinda failing to fulfill their original idea."
1.0,"From the image and cost, you would expect this shirt to be of a decent quality fabric.  It was not.  The material was of poor quality; it was flimsy and felt clingy.  I intended to give it to my dad, but ended up returning it.  The color and design weren‚Äôt as nice as pictured, either.  This is definitely not a $40+ shirt‚Ä¶I wouldn‚Äôt have paid $5 for it.  Disappointing."
1.0,Ugh no one mentioned that it‚Äôs a crop top.. pointless buy.
1.0,This is a comical face where the image was about 3 times the size it should be.
1.0,Material feels like garbage sack
1.0,See through. I did not like it at all
1.0,"I just received this item, but it's for a child, maybe a teenager, but not for a woman as pictured.  It is very small in the top and the material stretches so much that everything is showing.  Furthermore, it is way too short, where it just covers the thighs.  I am 5'6&#34; and 36&#34; bust.  Finally, there is no seam at all where the material is just cut up.  Looks more like a high school project than a commercial product.  So much for the &#34;pre-Black Friday flash sale&#34; that Amazon ran a few days ago.  Very, very disappointed, especially for the great reviews that were written up."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:644b8e2e44f56a853f14689bdec1cf3c]] My reviews are based on the price of the product and if it met, exceeded or failed to meet my expectations at that price.<br /><br />I paid $35 for this watch.<br /><br />I was so excited to get this watch.  I loved the way it looked and based on the previous reviews stating that it was a $125 watch, I was happy to see that it had dropped to $35.<br /><br />My expectations were not high, but seeing that it was an automatic watch, I thought it could be a potential diamond in the rough.<br /><br />So, when I got the watch and opened it, my ""diamond in the rough"" dreams were quickly dashed.<br /><br />I looked over the watch and was less than impressed right out of the gate.  The bracelet felt hollow when I picked it up.  Then I went to set the time and the stem pulled right out.  You can see it in the video I posted.  Needless to say I was extremely disappointed.  I didn't want to give up though so I requested a replacement and sent that one back as defective.<br /><br />The second watch arrived and I was still optimistic but it was short lived again.<br /><br />The bezel was so loose that I could almost spin it both directions.  And in this watch, the movement was not what was pictured (and was also different from the first watch I received).  The second movement was a gold toned movement with what looked like a pink plastic part in it. (See the attached picture)  It also had trouble starting after setting the time.  Once it started, it wasn't a problem, but that gave me more reason to doubt what I received would last long.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I returned the second watch and asked for a refund this time.<br /><br />I will continue to look for super affordable automatic watches that are worth what I pay for them, this one is clearly not even worth the $35 (and the time to return it...twice).<br /><br />I can't recommend this watch at all and I won't be buying any other watch from Benyar.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, I'd really appreciate if you could mark the review as helpful.<br /><br />Thanks!"
1.0,I just received this shipment and the mocha cardigan wasn‚Äôt included. I only got 2... the bag was opened when it arrived but I can‚Äôt imagine how a third cardigan could have fit in that bag.<br /><br />I have reached out to the seller- I will update this review based on their response.
1.0,These earrings are not the mellow-ish pink it shows. It is bright bright Orange. Very disappointed.
1.0,Two of Briefs had inch long tears in the seem. These used to be so well made sadly that is no longer true!
1.0,I barely got a chance to wear this shirt before it started falling apart (2 days after the return window closed).
1.0,"This was a gift to one of my family members, in fact, I made her choose this for my self and she liked it so I gifted this on her birthday, This watch looks really astonishing with the design but for her, it only lasted few weeks. This thing stopped working all of sudden as soon as we passed the return date which is quite funny."
1.0,"Company will not pay for return shipping  on "" unwanted item ""  I only want a medium not a small. I ordered the size based on their size chart and it is so small that it will fit my 11 year old daughter.  Do NOT purchase from this seller"
1.0,"It looked so nice on the website, but it I'd not normal t-shirt material.  Not what I thought I ordered."
1.0,"Too large, bulky. Didn‚Äôt clean brass as stated."
1.0,"I absolutely love my 90 Degree by Reflex leggings that I bought sometime last year. These, however, were nothing like them. These were pretty sheer when I put them on and are definitely not the same quality as the last ones. It's so disappointing."
1.0,"Very bad quality, too small, tight, I returned it the same day."
1.0,"This is the 2nd Big Buddha purse I've ever owned.  I love the brand for the great design and details, and also because it's made with imitation leather.  My first bag lasted a long time and I always got compliments on it, however, this purchase has been nothing but trouble.  My purse arrived with some sort of glue on it and the 'leather' was torn in 2 places.  I assumed that this was on the fault of Amazon and not BB.  I returned it and they sent another one.  This tine the purse was packaged much better and was in pristine condition.  I was very happy.  Then a week later I was walking around and the purse suddenly fell onto the floor; the strap had broken.  I was very annoyed by this and sent Amazon another request for an exchange and I got the following email:<br /><br />""...We are unable to replace the item ""Big Buddha Charlie Handbag""... as it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement...""<br /><br />Very disappointing!  I was telling my sister about this and she told me she had the same problem.  She had gotten a BB bag (different style) because she liked mine so much, and after a couple of days the strap broke!  Keep in mind that the contents of my purse only weigh a couple lbs, which is less than the average woman.  So it wasn't because I loaded it up too heavy, but because the bag was defective."
1.0,This hat came up in a search for &#34;hats for big heads.&#34; It is not a hat for big heads. It is a regular one-size-fits-some hat. Please fix your keywords and stop wasting my time.
1.0,"It costs close to the price paid to return the briefs. For anyone thinking about purchasing these, the briefs run large."
1.0,A waste of money. Wouldn't stay on.
1.0,This dress smell like it been at a gas station all day ....I will never order from that place again.
1.0,I'd give no stars if i could. The glasses I received are nothing like the ones advertised. They are NOT polarized. They actually seem to have a 3d effect. And the lenses are smokey instead of black.
1.0,this broke the first time i wore it... does not hold up to my expectations
1.0,Very cheap..I cant wear it it will fall apart..looks pretty though sitting on the table
1.0,These aren't fitting on no grown woman nipples

1.0,White shirt came with a pull across the chest.
1.0,Dont Buy it..Looks Cheap!!! Waste of Money
1.0,This product was used and it had receipt in it and the zipper was broke
1.0,Bought for teenage grandson who plays trombone in school band.  Barely goes over my ankle and can't get it up my leg only to just past ankle not even to calf (grandmother).  His feet are bigger than mine.  The add says it will fit all sizes so unless you have the smallest feet and legs don't buy.
1.0,"these fit very large, so if you are large buy small, if not you will regret it,thats all i have to say"
1.0,"They are cheap, both literally and figuratively. These turned colors within a day of wearing. Don't bother buying."
1.0,These fangs are not what I expected. They do not fit over my teeth correctly and the plastic cuts my gums.
1.0,Watch is pretty bit it's to small the colors make it hard to see the hands on watch
1.0,"While the suit fit fine, the pants tore within a couple hours and while just walking, not even anything strenuous or anything. What a joke..."
1.0,Small than it said it was
1.0,"Fit and construction is horrible. The small fits like a large, the sleeves are huge and one shoulder seam has extra materials making the shoulders look uneven."
1.0,Horrible worst jumpsuit you could buy unless you want to look like a refrigerator. Super Huge and long
1.0,Came bunched in medium size bag. Late and didn‚Äôt look like pictures advertisement.
1.0,They are cheap costume jewelry
1.0,The pictures online look better than when you receive the dress.
1.0,Bow is cute. Shoes are small and 0 support
1.0,Tried to return bc it did not fit. They will not give me a refund. Wants to just give me discount. I will never buy from the company again. Do not buy if you might have to return for any reason.

1.0,"not happy with it,didnt like the color"
1.0,The quality of fabric was very poor.
1.0,"Ordered 2 of these watches, neither one works!!! VERY disappointed. Kept forgetting to do return, missed the window, now I'm stuck with 2 watches that do not work!"
1.0,"So mad. These are not at all ""4th of July."" They must have ran out of red and used coral instead!"
1.0,"Unfortunately these just look weird when they are on, could be just me but they look really cool until I wear them ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1.0,"The reason I purchased this gator was because it had a filter.  However, the filter did not stay in the slot very well.  It might if I pulled it up and left it up, but repeatedly raising and lowering it, causes the filter to come out. I think the reason it does not stay in place is because the slot is at the top of the mask.  Perhaps if it was a side vertical slot or if the slot had a fold to hold it in place, it would work better.  It is difficult to try and rearrange the filter when it is on your neck.<br /><br />I had someone call me from the supplier and asked how I like the Gator.  I expressed my dissatisfaction.  He thanked me for the report and said they would talk to the factory."
1.0,If going dancing no go... Moistened is not it's friend
1.0,This was way to small bought 2 and ordered a 3x & 4x and these where so small that not even my youngest daughter could use it either .
1.0,This shirt ripped in the first 5 mins that I put it on. It was perfect fitting until it fell apart.
1.0,"I got this for my daughters friend and before she wore it, it ripped. I figured it wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal and sewed it. Then when she wore it this evening, the whole sleeve tore at the seams. I had gotten one that I had to send back, because of the size. I didn‚Äôt realize the quality was so terrible or I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have gotten another!"
1.0,The zipper is broken making it unwearable.
1.0,So cheaply made. The tunnels are terrible and peel.
1.0,Item  fell apart as soon as they were put on his head would not stay together
1.0,The dress is cute but not what I ordered. Returning
1.0,Should have been 13 pair only received 1
1.0,"Not long as the picture depicts, i ordered a size up and instead of it being longer as I would have imagined it was wider... way wider and still short it barly reachs to my hips!"
1.0,Ordered an XXL and it is 2 sizes smaller. Returning it today
1.0,broke right when i walked up a hill the first time wearing them.
1.0,I ordered a large.  I weigh 120lbs and neither the top nor the bottoms came close to fitting!!
1.0,Sized too small. My little one is in a 10. Ordered 12. Too small.
1.0,The letters are wonky and a 3x fits more like a Large. It runs extremely small.
1.0,"Whenever I wear this skirt, I heard a funny comment from other people. This skirt is too long and looks heavy."
1.0,Too small in the chest area. The bottom buttoned but not the top. Had to return.
1.0,The red is burgundy!
1.0,"One pair of these socks says ""My corgi loves a$$"". Why isn't Amazon taking this down. These are children's socks."
1.0,Please don't order these shoes! I didn't expect high quality at this price but I've never seen quality this bad in shoes. The sole is unevenly molded and the glue is visible all the way around the shoe. They feel so flimsy I'm afraid to wear them because I don't think they'll hold up.  There is puckering around the toe and they aren't stiff enough to hold their shape well. I wouldn't take these if they were free. Also I didn't realize that the return shipping isn't free so I have to eat $13 to return these to China. I hate leaving negative reviews and rarely take the time to leave reviews so when I do its because its REALLY bad!
1.0,"A very cheap looking chaine, and it is not shiny at all"
1.0,HUGE everywhere except in the bust!
1.0,Wish I could give it NO STAR! Way more rose colored than usual.. Had an orange tent & felt very cheaply made!! Broke literally 2 seconds after putting it on! Alain you could hardly ready the Michael kors wording... Hated this! Wasted my money.
1.0,XL fits more like a medium. The material is trash. Really not worth the buy at all
1.0,They don‚Äôt write on glass well.  Big waste of money!
1.0,beautiful necklace....unfortunately it was delivered broken.  Now I have to go out and spend more money to buy jewelry before a special event because I don't have any more time for another delivery
1.0,"I bought the black lens RIVBOS and loved them so I bought another pair, but this time with blue lenses. I am definitely not satisfied. I take care of these sunglasses well. I keep them in the awesome pouch when not wearing. I've never used chemical cleaners. I have never dropped them. BUT the blue tint has already come off a lot. I have only had these for a few months."
1.0,Wood was poor quality
1.0,Shame. This is WAY too small.
1.0,This product is not the same as in the photo.  Disappointed in the product
1.0,Will not run.  I have replaced the battery and it still will not run.  Very disappointed.  A total waste of my limited funds.
1.0,So sad I have to return these but they‚Äôre completely see thru.
1.0,"This is not safe if used as intended. Every single carseat manufacturer states not to use after market items with their seats. Each seat was tested to work properly to protect your child with the items that COME WITH IT ONLY. This product used with the covers that go over the straps could cause your child to be injured or killed in a crash. It's impossible to know whether they may be okay. It's not worth risking your child's life.<br /><br />This is a good idea if attached elsewhere. Perhaps a Velcro piece attached to the side of the carseat to keep the important info near the child. Or just use a sticker for the carseat with all important info, or a bracelet with important info like diabetes."
1.0,"One word: Useless!<br />I tried this with a backless dress, but it wouldn't stay on. The adhesive didn't stick and it kept coming loose.<br />Needless to say, I couldn't use it. I had to go with a different product that had a better grip (and adhesion)."
1.0,Would not buy again.  The hinge did not function properly so in order to open it had to be pried open.  This was a ‚Äútoken‚Äù to be carried at a wedding and there was no time for a return/exchange.
1.0,"This underwear rolled down at the waist. Maybe because they were too small, but ordered the size recommended."
1.0,Poor quality. plastic like
1.0,Really cute suit and I'm very disappointed.  I have I guess what you would call an athletic build? I ordered a large and extra large since you can't buy separates.<br />Bottoms: large: way too small/tight on rear but fit nicely in front. Extra large: still too tight on rear and baggy in front.<br />Top: the difference between large and extra large is more in the length than the width but unfortunately it's width I need.  I normally wear an extra large top but I had MAJOR under-boob or too much showing on top because the material is too narrow.<br />Bummed that I'll be sending all of these back :(
1.0,There may as well be zero underwires in this bra because that‚Äôs how cheap it‚Äôs made. Very disappointed.
1.0,The strap snapped my first time putting the wings on and the feathers were falling off already so it wasn‚Äôt really worth it
1.0,Waste of money. The most cheapest feeling glasses for too much money. Reduce the price and it's be a ok deal
1.0,"The material is a slippery, thin and poor quality. The pants are completely see through in the white part right over the butt.  The seams look like they will pull apart easily."
1.0,"I have pretty normal size calves, and these are about two inches too short to zipper!! Real shame cause they're adorable boots, but NOPE! Also, I normally wear a size 7, I ordered up to a 9 and my toes are close to the edge. Don't waste ypir money on these. There are many better options!"
1.0,The dress is too small size chart is not accurate
1.0,quality of all Spanx products has drastically diminished over the past 5 years! i used to love these products--and was willing to pay a premium for them.  Now they roll up and feel (and look!) more like a girdle. not sure why she changed the material and style but it's definitely not as good. these roll up and aren't as comfortable as they used to be. def not worth the money.
1.0,"Shapeless and nothing like the photo. Unlined fabric, elasticized waist, no darts or structure to the  fabric. The good news I didn't have to wait long."
1.0,I too purchased this product because people were leaving such good reviews about it holding up well. It made it three months until the clip broke off from me trying to put it back on the belt clip of my pants. I ride a motorcycle and it would have been a disaster if I lost my keys on the road. ZERO stars for this product!
1.0,The material is awful and flimsy and the waistband is too thick.
1.0,Turns a copper color after wearing 1 day also turns finger green this IS NOT sterling silver it is something you would get out of a quarter machine.. would not recommend..
1.0,I wish I could give 0 stars. By far one of the cheapest items of clothing I've ever purchased.
1.0,The straps are always moving and becoming uneven
1.0,"I can't really give these any stars, because there is no way these were 2x tank tops. I'm not sure if they were meant for children or are asian sizing."
1.0,The product came into a different sizes. I ordered SMALL size but they gave me MEDIUM and EXTRA LARGE sizes. What a waste of time and money!
1.0,I am a size 12 on the bottom so I ordered the largest size they have. I was shocked and so disappointed to find that it was way too small. Sending it back!!
1.0,I loved it but ordered a xxL and it‚Äôs like a small couldn‚Äôt get it on ridiculous
1.0,Not what I expected. The post is along the edge instead of centered in the middle of the piece which makes it dangle off the edge of the ear. I would give them to my teenager but they're sort of gaudy. Nothing delicate as expected.
1.0,Very cheaply made and too short.
1.0,"I can't even park the boxes, this dress is so trashy and crap quality... Just don't bother it's horrible!!! Ugly tacky gross I have a nice bust line it did nothing good for anything... Horrible!!"
1.0,Disliked that the hair headband kept moving!
1.0,Stiff and uncomfortable. I think i got the medium - The shorts are literally for a 10 year old and the top is pretty big. I wish i returned them but didn‚Äôt have the time.
1.0,The fur is like a costume fur and the sweater is ruined after washing. Looks matted and appears like a fake costume.
1.0,Socks lasted 8 trips to the swimming pool. Started tearing and wearing holes in bottom. I would not recommend this item
1.0,The first day I wore this necklace it broke. Twice! The ‚Äústone‚Äù fell out of it first and then the chain broke. Obvisoulsy cheaply made.
1.0,Will not buy again never got belt
1.0,I wore these socks one day& my middle toe come right through the sock
1.0,"After one wash the entire outfit looked like it had been through a tornado, unless you plan on ironing for every wear then it would be worth purchasing. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying this as cute as it was."
1.0,"Threw them away, bought some Haines underwear instead.  These are like little girls panties, very dainty."
1.0,These pants are not only see through but they're much smaller than described. The material feels cheap too.
1.0,"As soon as I went to put them on, it snapped. I wanted to loved these, but oh well.<br /><br />I will say they did not look tarnished or anything. The finish on them was great. But can‚Äôt give 5 stars for a broken product."
1.0,"In the description it is listed as ""cotton"" but it's nylon. Don't request a replacement because it's the same and you as the consumer have to pay for return postage, which I don't feel is right. :("
1.0,"Cannot connect to my Michael Kors Access watch, Bradshaw model.  Returned."
1.0,I‚Äôve worn these pants three times and the material has faded so much it almost looks like they have been bleached. I purchased several other colors and hope they do not fade as much as the grey pair has.
1.0,"First of all, looks nothing like the photo.  I'm a size 14, so I ordered a size 20 because I wanted it oversized.  It's still tight.  Secondly, not worth the price.  Returning."
1.0,spring tension did not work at all. cheaply made product.
1.0,This is not worth the box it was shipped in.. Made in China and very poor. Look at the picture better than I did because that is it.  Two flat pieces of fake carbon fiber and a cheep piece of elastic.  It is worthless.  I purchased the front pocket Travelambo .. that one is good.
1.0,Feels and looks good u til you go and put it on. Snapped and beads went everywhere in seconds. I‚Äôm returning. Thanks for the mess
1.0,Very poor flimsy quality and broke after the first two times my daughter wore it.  Would not recommend this at all.
1.0,"Horrible glasses, lasted maybe 2 months."
1.0,"On one entire side of the shirt, the seam is missing!  That made it take a while to figure out how to put it on!  But since it's a v-neck, I figured it out and then relized, one side of the shirt is fully open, while the other is enclosed...incrediably bummed."
1.0,Wore them for a week straight. Loved them until they tarnished.
1.0,"Came earlier then expected which I was really happy about but when I put it on it was way too tight, I ordered it in a XL and it did zip up all the way but rather disappointed that it felt more like a smaller size then a XL, beautiful romper I just wish the XL actually fit like a XL should since I wear a L from all my clothing but since this did it by Asian sizing I thought a XL would fit perfectly since I went by the size chart."
1.0,"Too small, order 2 sizes up"
1.0,"Wanted Aunt, not Uncoe"
1.0,I love the pocket design but the elastic fuz started showing up the FIRST day i wore the skirt! That is crazy unacceptable! I have never had this happen before with this brand normally...
1.0,? I did not order this
1.0,[[VIDEOID:39931473a482434abeed60246d5b936d]]
1.0,I bought these as a gift for someone but they were abnormally small the person I bought them for is very small but could not get them on ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ
1.0,It‚Äôs a boxy looking shirt instead of female cut.
1.0,"Sooo small!!!! Order up two or three sizes. Is this a child's dress? I only weigh 108 pounds and that is with a cast up to my knee! I'm probably 105 pounds. I'm 5'2 1/2"". I ordered a Medium and I liked the print so got brave and ordered one even though it was 95% plastic and 5% rubber. The underarms cut into me, whereas usually they hang down so low you can see my bra, had I not burned it in the 1970's. I would like to make men wear those horrid contraptions! Most of them need one more than I do. This dress is gone now. Of course. Wanted to get it in X-large and in the solid AGAIN because I do not like wearing plastic clothes. I wish the milkman would come back with glass bottles we can reuse and not have to wear! Why can't ANY of these dresses come in good old fashion 100% COTTON? I'm pretty sure even all these SOLID ones aren't 95% cotton like they claim, because they stretch like a rubber band in every direction. And forget all about finding ANY printed dresses in cotton! I am from the good old days when clothes were comfortable and so simple and cute, and you didn't sweat five minutes out of the shower because you put on a summer dress. Regardless of my rants, this particular dress is super tight under armpits. Otherwise it is cute and I love the side pockets."
1.0,"Way Way Way to small XXL maybe would fit a small 12 year old boy, very laughable"
1.0,My sweater shed everywhere. It also falls apart too easily. It came with a snag in the weave that I had to fix
1.0,"Cheap, plastic, don‚Äôt stay attached<br />Threw them in the garbage"
1.0,"Ridiculous top. The white one I got was as see-through as tissue paper, which is NOT how it appears in photos. I returned it without even trying it on."
1.0,"This item is such a complete and total waste of money, the cost makes it border on a sham.<br /><br />It LOOKS like it should work, but the reality is that several of them just shredded in the first wash or two - in a really gentle high-quality washing machine in which I can wash wool sweaters without ruining them.  They don't stay put.  They are too thin to serve the purpose, and their two-dimensionality makes things even worse.  They are hard and not absorbent.<br /><br />You know what works 100 times better?  Kleenex.  Or Cotton balls.  It's cheaper, too, and can be composted afterwards.  Also, some some thin cotton nursing bras to use underneath a regular bra - works WAY better.<br /><br />The vendor sent me colored ones when I ordered white.  A minor problem since they didn't work"
1.0,"very cheap feel, but looks okay. I probably won't wear them."
1.0,I didn't realize these were unisex when I bought them.  Horrible fit.  You can't take a shoe that's made for a man and say a woman can wear it just because her foot is smaller.  Arch is too long and high to fit a woman's foot.  The toe area is the shoe is too long so the shoe bends in a different place than a woman's normally would.  Wore for 1 walk with my dogs and that was it.  My feet were swollen and hurting badly when I got home.  Horrible.  Oofos are terrific! Oofos Unisex are horrible.
1.0,"This shirt is Or Was cute.. UNTIL I WASHED IT..once it was dry I noticed that ALL THE LETTERS IN DAYTONA ARE NOW BLUE N NO LONGER SHINY SILVER.. The Harley Davidson silver part stayed silver, but all the shiny part on Daytona IS GONE.. SUPER DISAPPOINTED!!üò¢"
1.0,LEAKS!
1.0,"Not good, I returned it."
1.0,this bra was missing the back section making it totally unuseable.
1.0,Just to small everything else good
1.0,not a good set - looks cheap. the charms are not well made
1.0,"Runs very small, no stretch to material."
1.0,"Very strange extra clear plastic piece, you can't see in the picture, above the bridge of the nose."
1.0,"Not even 1 minute that I unwrapped it, the center turquoise piece fell off. The wood looked nice but I won't wear it because then my ears would be uneven"
1.0,Very low quality product
1.0,"buenas noches, aun espero por el producto segun falta la factura la he enviado miles de veces por correo a la empresa pobanet en miami y aun no me envian el producto."
1.0,I bought two for me and my bestie! Thought it was basically like his merch but it‚Äôs just a iron on plastic sticker and is terrible quality!
1.0,"Horribly thin material....WAY TOO SMALL!!! I wear a large in almost every shirt, so I ordered a large here. However, after trying to put this on it was definitely like a small."
1.0,Way too small. I tried to order a size up and it looks like I needed to order it 2 sizes up.
1.0,Broke within a week of wear
1.0,"I LOVED the look of this ring, but I had to return it. It tarnished working 10 minutes of my wearing it. I wish I was exaggerating‚Ä¶ DO NOT buy this ring."
1.0,It helps support my back but that is about it. I wore it once and I probable never wear it again because it is uncomfortable and has to be worn outside a shirt not underneath. As I am very active I wear tight cloths so they don't rise and it was more of an inconvenience than I want.
1.0,"When my order arrived, the packaging was for the correct color umbrella, but the one I received was definitely not the right one (green leaves instead of purple blossoms). I sent it back and re-ordered. The second arrival was the correct umbrella, but it was broken when received. The packaging was not damaged in any way, my conclusion is that it went into the box broken and was then mailed to me. No thank you - I returned the broken one too, and will not be re-ordering this item again."
1.0,"My husband prefers not to use it, it is too small, it seems that it will fall out of his head, it is used by my little daughter but she does not look comfortable either."
1.0,Fits boxy
1.0,"I ordered a 10W, which is my size.  Couldn't even put it on.  Way to small."
1.0,"Horrible fabric! Not comfortable at all.<br />Plus to return it to the UK, it's going to cost me $22!"
1.0,Only wore it maybe 3 times within a week of getting it and 1 stone fell out and another was loose. Was a pretty ring and really liked it. Wished it had been made better!!
1.0,Runs very small they weren‚Äôt what I wanted more like yoga pants
1.0,Washed shirt for the first time and button fell off in washer. Noticed hole in shirt near next button down. Not good.
1.0,Disliked it because the bands don‚Äôt stay on my wrist. If u have small wrist I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
1.0,It came with the letters peeling off
1.0,The magnets are a super annoying pain in the behind! I kept trying to put the band on the watch and they kept sticking to each other. It was really annoying! This band has weight to it. I was able to notice immediately while wearing it. I‚Äôm sure for most people it isn‚Äôt a big deal but o have smaller wrists and felt a noticeable difference that was uncomfortable. The band also kept pulling at my skin. Returning!
1.0,Item is cheap and looks cheap.
1.0,"Size: Small<br />To be evaluated as 100% linen socks, these would have to be 100% linen socks. Since they aren't, they can only ever get one star for the category...<br /><br />The socks have an incredible amount of stretch - very springy stretch, the texture is wrong, and the way the weave looks is wrong. If anything it looks like nylon stockings dressed up as socks with some linen thrown in.<br /><br />My intention was to use them as summer hiking socks, and the only thing that interested me about these socks were that they were 100% linen - really, that they were 100% anything non-synthetic; I might even have tried leather socks out of desperation. '<br /><br /> I took some photos of the socks next to a 100% linen pillowcase, and a cotton/linen blend shirt. I did a stretch test. It's not a very precise measurement, but it's accurate. The socks stretch to a ridiculous size, while the actual linen items don't have much stretch - and the linen one gets some stretch just because it tends to wrinkle, and the wrinkles expand when it's stretched.<br /><br />I noticed quality issues when I was looking through the pictures - small holes, defects in the stitching - little things that would probably cause the sock to develop holes or come apart pretty quickly in its life.<br /><br />I'd bet these have a significant amount of spandex; if not then polyester or nylon. Probably a combination, and probably they do have SOME linen.<br /><br />I hope that &#34;FlaxSox&#34; isn't knowingly selling people socks with synthetic fibers but advertising them as 100% linen. Someone could have a serious sensitivity or allergy, and get very sick from buying these socks."
1.0,Shoes are very cheaply made. Granddaughter wore them for 2 weeks and they are already falling apart.
1.0,"There are rust stains on the back of it. Pretty nasty if you ask me. ü§Æ tried to get it out with oxy clean, shout advanced, etc.. didn‚Äôt even budge, that‚Äôs why I figure it‚Äôs rust. Will update if I get a hassle free replacement from the seller."
1.0,"This is something I bought for special occasions where I need a white belt. I pulled it out and wore it for the first time last night. As I was walking to the car the grommet gave and the entire belt fell apart. Next time, suspenders!<br /><br />Because I hadn't tried to wear this before the 30 day return deadline, I have a $9 leather strap for which I have no use.<br /><br />Had I purchased this from Walmart, Target or Macy's I would have been able to exchange it for something made just a little bit better."
1.0,"Not the quality I was expecting, and it didn't work for my studs."
1.0,I was really excited to receive this dress. Unfortunately the style was not what I was expecting. It looks different from the picture. It‚Äôs also a but sheer. I had to return.
1.0,Isn't form fitting..top was tight bottom was really long and lose..just wasn't pleasing to the eye.
1.0,Bought this item before and came in decent quality of cotton fabric. Reordered for a friend and it‚Äôs terrible fabric. Feels like nylon.
1.0,Nothing like the picture (I got the &#34;white&#34; one). I received it and it was pretty poorly done and the white is more of a yellow white. Would not recommend.
1.0,"Way too small, xxl fits like a L"
1.0,Colors not as advertised
1.0,It is more like a nightgown than a dress.
1.0,"Maybe if you want to scare people, but these are not for kids.<br />Or women .<br />THESE MASKS ARE NOT FUNNY<br /><br />TONGUE HANGING OUT ON ALL>"
1.0,Way too big!! Bought it for my daughter she usually wears 18m I bought the 12m-18m and it was way too big!! Definitely returning
1.0,"Material is thin, fur is thin, fits like a medium rather than large which is what I ordered. I‚Äôll keep it I guess, not worth what I paid by any stretch. Pockets are sewn shut. Looks like Chinese junk. Ugh. Save your money!!! Correction........It is going back!!!!!"
1.0,Stay away from buying this brand. Size not even close it‚Äôs a joke.
1.0,"Not as described. Looked different, fit too small"
1.0,I would have worn these to work since I have reynauds syndrome.
1.0,they came tarnished when i open the package!
1.0,These are not silk. If you don‚Äôt mind that then they are fine but I specifically bought them because I wanted silk. I will be returning and buying from another brand that hopefully doesn‚Äôt mislead customers and uses real silk.
1.0,"This should be labeled as a crop top, not to mention the TERRIBLE quality of the picture! Did you print this in the 90's?!"
1.0,"it‚Äôs not fitted, no belt. just weird."
1.0,The grey hamster came weird looking
1.0,"Gave to my sister to ask her to be my maid of honor. Perfect for the occasion and hoped she'd wear to the wedding. The same day I gave it to her, the metal started tarnishing. It was very embarrassing that it seemed like I gave her a very cheap present. Sent back immediately."
1.0,Way too small. 7/8 fits like a 3/4 couldn‚Äôt even use.
1.0,Clasp that connects to the watch doesn't engage.  One of three that I purchases from different sellers.  All have the same issue.
1.0,Turns ear green
1.0,Couldn't wear body to short
1.0,This is NOT a cotton shirt. More like a polyester blend my grandma would wear. Looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,"Had to give it Way, but really loved the quality"
1.0,"The material is like paper, the sizing is extremely small. Ordered a size bigger just to be safe and still wasn‚Äôt the right size. If you order‚Ä¶. Good luck!"
1.0,I had allergic reaction my face and lips swell up from the dye in The mask
1.0,"Poor instructions, probably just poor translation into American English, let alone proper English<br />Power source does not stay plugged in. It shakes loose from the back of the box from the oscillation of the watches from within.<br />However, although obviously cheaply made and assembled, this is a good looking piece.<br />It would be fantastic if it would work long enough so we could set the individual watches to the correct pulse rate."
1.0,The zipper broke within a week of using it.
1.0,"Terrible, the nose mounts were mounted to the frame at least 2/8 off from each other, they sat lobsided."
1.0,Doesn't look as good as in the picture. Doesn't fit properly.
1.0,Above is a picture of the coat I received and next to it is a picture of the coat I ordered neither are the same coat why are the sleeves so short I ordered a 2x I got sent a 3X and the sleeves feel like they could fit my eight-year-old The Furrer inside is all ripped up there are strings hanging of the hood piece that‚Äôs not even attached to the hood this coat is a joke the material it is made out of is awful I have 200 count thread sheets with that are softer than that for the money I spent I could‚Äôve got a lot better coat at Walmart do not buy
1.0,Returning it. Had a hole in the side. Looks very cheap on.
1.0,"I purchased one set and was satisfied with the length of the torso (I usually have to buy tall shirts). So I bought a second set and regrettably, the second set is noticeably shorter and make then very uncomfortable because they ride up."
1.0,really cheap and fragile look when you receive
1.0,Way too small now just hanging in my closet
1.0,"Upon arrival... beautiful pendant, but chain is small, extremely light weight & delicate. Extender broke off while attempting to wear for the first time. Unable to fix chain & pendant would be difficult to place on a different chain. Good price for low quality product. Never got to wear it. Dissappointed : ("
1.0,"Ughhhh this shirt is like a torture device of fashion.  Here's how your workday goes: You put it on and realize that it's completely transparent. Take it off. Then you put on a tank, and put it on again, and your hair is standing on end with static! You take it off.  You spray the shirt with static guard, and try again.  You put it on carefully, and it gives you one huge sports bra like breast area, 30 extra inches on the waist, and it hugs your bum. You try on every pant or skirt or legging you own, only to discover NOTHING goes with this shirt.  Alas, despite yoyr dashion sense you wear leggings as pants, slap a belt on it and run to work.  As soon as you get there you are forced to actually raise your arm up, and the elastic neckline slips above your shoulder, it's tight around your neck, and your bum is hanging out of the bottom! Icing on the cake...your hair is sticking to your lip gloss because the fabric attracts static like a balloon on carpet."
1.0,"Huge and the material was extremely cheap, returned"
1.0,When you put it on the front neck and back do not line up ‚Ä¶hangs side ways ..worse purchase I‚Äôve ever made from Amazon
1.0,I usually wear a large.  I selected XX-large and it was too small.  The material was very stiff.  Did not like it.
1.0,This item broke after 3 months of use. The seconds hand came loose. I used it to get heart rates respiratory rates in rooms without wall clocks. I kept it in my lab coat pocket so it wasn't taking any kind of abuse and had no exposure to water. I would not recommend.
1.0,The battery doesn't last long
1.0,Runs SMALL !!!<br />Wrap dress with not enough material to wrap dress!
1.0,The pockets are upside down and the yellow things on the back look nothing like a dinosaur. Seems like they rushed it.  Sending back
1.0,Not worth buying. Looks pretty in picture but very flimsy dress.
1.0,"Got the item quickly for a Christmas gift for my daughter she opened it up on Christmas Day December 25,21015 and the watch is broke. The hands inside the watch are broke"

1.0,"I bought a size up, but its small on me. to tight. I will donate it."
1.0,Too complicated. Returned it.

1.0,"[[VIDEOID:98a160d9ebbca4dc576ae4597b78dc01]] I was disappointed when item arrived cause it was not cotton as describe , quality is no good very tin not what I expected."
1.0,Did not fit. Unfortunately.
1.0,Awful!!! Looks like a cheap uniform top. Tossed it in the trash!
1.0,This looked nothing like the photo when on. It runs really small!!!!! Did not care for the cut at all.
1.0,Don't like the color. Not blue but green. Too late to return since was away for work and didn't check my purchase faster
1.0,I was really upset to find that an xxl fit almost with 3/4 sleeves!  I have totally normal arm length and was so disappointed I returned it.
1.0,The picture makes it look like a sweater but it's more like T-shirt material. Sent it back.
1.0,"Very Unhappy! I was under the impression that this item would be as good as it was displayed; however, (to my dismay)...looks can obviously be horribly deceiving. First off, I received this item broken, so I had to basically makeshift it together to resemble what it had initially appeared to look like. Secondly, this bracelet honestly looks and feels like those child's play vending machine items... WHY? So, last but not least...I basically had this gift for my spouse, and she appreciated it of course...but only because she has a heart of gold. All in all...Bad product unless you're a little girl playing dress up. I was hoping for so much more but ended up humiliated. One star for this item only for getting to me in a timely manner, but that's all. Needless to say, my wife will still wear it since she's beautiful enough to pull anything off. I don't know how long this bracelet will hold up, but I won't make the same mistake by purchasing a product from this merchant, &#34;Suyi.&#34; I hope others can learn from my experience, and take it from me that I believe this item is merely for  children's play fashion. I hate to have to give bad reviews but there you have it, and I guess you get what you pay for unfortunately. Good luck to those who make a purchase on this item anyhow! Oh!...and by the way (just a note to the manufacturers)...If there was a category for &#34;Tinkertoys,&#34; this is where this item would belong... And I am so very sorry to have to have even said this!"
1.0,"I returned this because it didn't look anything like this picture of a black purse with silver emblem, instead I got a large brown bag that was not what I expected! Beware!"
1.0,Shorter than the pair I bought before in the same size
1.0,"They shipped the wrong color, the fringe drug the ground and trying to tie them , it‚Äôs just a poor design in my opinion."
1.0,Terrible suit! Top is so small and the bottom is squeaky.. it's maybe be suited for a size 2 woman and not a size 12!
1.0,ALL THE CHARMS AND WATCH BROKE OFF THE BAND WITH IN A DAY
1.0,Ordered a large and it's too small
1.0,Sized WAY TOO SMALL! I wear a very standard US Large. The label says Made in China XXL and runs VERY SMALL!

1.0,"Nunca me lleg√≥... al parecer el proveedor dej√≥ de dar servicio. Una pena, la blusa luce muy linda."
1.0,Tip broke off on the 2nd day of having it
1.0,"These are not Made in USA Telic shoes.  I ordered my normal size and received a shoe where the quality is severely lacking, and the size is not what I ordered. I held this shoe up to the Telics I  already have, and these shoes are 3/4"" of an inch shorter and my heel hangs off the back of the shoe.  KNOCK OFFs.  Returned."
1.0,I received a completely empty package !
1.0,Terrible fit. Seriously the whole hat is crooked. I'm not sure how that's possible but it is. I'm so disappointed. It's also too small.
1.0,horrible broke off and too big wouldn't fit and changed colors. save your money.
1.0,"Total disappointment...<br />1.The material is extremely cheap and entirely different to what is shown in the pictures advertised<br />2.The colour is nothing like what i expected<br />I ordered the green and the dress I received is much lighter, although the pic I post doesn't show it that much.  I don't think I'll ever leave the house in this dress."
1.0,"Cheapo, basically what u'd expect for the price, don't recommend it"
1.0,Very harsh material.  Looks like paint on the fabric.
1.0,The earring was not in the original package I received.
1.0,did not fit me. I wear size 34 (waist). I bought this using the size chart they provided but it was too small.
1.0,These yoga pants were too big and too stretchy. They did not hold their shape at all. Very disappointed in them
1.0,"You get what you pay for. The material was flimsy. My torso did not fit the bathing suit. I think even if it did fit length wise, I wouldn't feel secure with my boobs in it. üëé"
1.0,"Size much smaller, sleeves tight"
1.0,Very poor quality orderd a small tag says large.  Will never wear it waste of money
1.0,"Looks cheap, It was for mother day and it was a total disappointment since my wife though that was a fantasy Jewellery üòñ.  For the size is to light to be silver"
1.0,The hoodie I received is not the same color as the picture they are advertising. The stripes and logo are navy blue not gray. I bought black pants to go with it and now they will not match bc the hoodie has blue stripes.
1.0,"We ordered a 9/10 in kids and a medium in women's, not only did one of the dresses arrive late but they are both children's sizes and very small. The tops are also different types of stripes. Definitely NOT worth anything."
1.0,Did not fit my Fitbit
1.0,"This item looks very cheap, does not look like the pictures looks and feels very cheap."
1.0,"Horrible, mala calidad, m√°s transparencia que la bolsa de env√≠o üòûüòí y no hacen reembolso y el env√≠o me costo m√°s caro que el trapito üòí"
1.0,It dosen't work at all  the magnet is very week and I have tried everything too bad I didn't try it sooner return window has closed 25.00 down the tube!
1.0,Not at all as described. Short and cheaply made.
1.0,"Very cheap look, feels like a toy for kids."
1.0,"Unfortunately, the other reviews are correct. The photo in the ad did not accurately reflect what I received. The dress I received felt like it was made out of the material used for parachute pants or umbrellas...it does not feel like silk or rayon or other fabrics typically used to make a dress.<br /><br />The fabric is also very thin, so I cannot wear it without a slip.<br /><br />Sadly, I was also disappointed with the print itself. It is not simply a blue and white print; there is also a purple color that I was not expecting. The fabric's print in the photo looks expensive and has a bohemian quality to it; whereas, the dress I received has fabric print which has an extremely different look, like an Asian motif--sadly, it has a cheap/knockoff quality to it.<br /><br />I intially thought that I had received the wrong order because it looked so different in person. (See my photo of the dress I received and compare it to the photo in the ad--you be the judge.)<br /><br />What is fortunate is that it was not an expensive item."
1.0,I have to give this shirt 1 star.  The quality was poor and a small was quite large on me.  The seam on the top that connects the material showed through my sweater and the collar was a flimsy material so I could not get a nice pressed collar look which is what I was going for.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"‚ÄúJUST DON‚ÄôT, KEEP SCROLLING, NOT EVEN WORTH A SECOND GLANCE‚Äù<br /><br />I RATED IT ZERO STARS, It was my fault thinking you actually had/made the good product you listed, NO form of compression, the arm portion is as big as my thigh, ALMOST ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped from wrist to upper arm and I‚Äôm not a little person, NON-slip top ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è yeah that‚Äôs a joke, and HOW do you go from good reviews a yr ago, to the crappy product you sold/sent me,  WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, AND MY PATIENCE!!!!!!ü§¨ü§¨"
1.0,the magnet wasn‚Äôt even working
1.0,The string holding the beads is super thin and broke the first time I used it. Beads went all over the grocery aisle. Bummed because it was so cute!
1.0,Wash it and it will shrink hugely. It's just a big hat that looks stupid. I just can't wear it in front of people... So I never wear it.
1.0,Material is bad  To lose  horrible horrible don‚Äôt get it they are disgusting  üò±
1.0,When I went to unsnap the snaps to release the buckle the snap broke. I didn't even use any strength or anything was just testing the snap first to make sure it was a snap and not a pen. It broke and now I am afreade to try to unsnap the second snap to put on my buckle.
1.0,"This dress looks completely different than on the original posting. It had two extra halter-top straps. At first I thought these were fixed to the sides to be used to tie in the back, but nope- they were sewn to the top of the dress in addition to the shoulder straps. I considered just cutting them off but the way they were sewn, the nub of where I cut would‚Äôve stuck out. The material was really sheer too- big disappointment because I went through the reviews and photos. I‚Äôd take a photo but I already returned the dress"
1.0,I should have know after seeing a 3+ stars that it was garbage.  Would be caught wearing this if I had to go without clothe.  Its a little piece of garment which I would not even give away.
1.0,My wife and I both tried these socks.  Neither one of us were happy with the warmth they gave.  The fit was ok but a bit tight around the ankle. We really were interested in getting some warm socks.  These were not warm.
1.0,"If by ‚Äúdeep neck‚Äù you mean ‚Äúto your belly button,‚Äù this description is right on."
1.0,shoes were too small and I was disappointed in the quality of them. They seemed cheap and flimsy.
1.0,"I bought these September 1st and its November 4th and I'm looking for new shoes.  They've fallen apart at the toe, laces don't stay tight and the ""reinforced"" heel has misshapen."
1.0,Worst costume ever. Looks nothing like advertised. I got a long tutu instead with some kiddie costume. Biggest disappointment from China.
1.0,Cheap and way too small!
1.0,Much smaller than expected. Hoop didn't even reach to the inside of my nose.
1.0,bracelet is made with cheap material that does not allow for a good fit.
1.0,"I am 5‚Äô8 and 145 pounds. I usually wear a size 4/6 pants, and a size medium top. I ordered a size 10 in this dress and it is so tight in the chest area that it won‚Äôt button! The inside of the dress has ‚ÄúXXL‚Äù marked on the label, but when I placed the order, I ordered a size 10. The fabric feels and looks cheap. Returning!"
1.0,Flimsy and my boobs don‚Äôt stay in
1.0,Was NOT white or even close to white. Sent it right back. Did not even try it on.
1.0,Fit was much smaller than anticipated
1.0,"I got the XXS, the smallest size, and it was STILL too large. It looked like something a grandma would wear and the straps in the back were not working. Way, way too large. I am so disappointed.<br />It was so big that the slit just didn't work at all. It literally looked like there was no slit in the dress. It just looked like a grandma-esque dress. The V-neck cleavage whatever was barely even there."
1.0,"This shirt is huge, plus the fit is not very flattering. It balloons out at the bottom, and the pockets are thick which adds even more bulk around the waist area"
1.0,Very cheap quality. Would not recommend.
1.0,"It's like it was sized wrong , I love it but it doesn't fit right.."
1.0,"I first ordered the maroon color in size M, great quality but was running quite big. I returned it but wanted have a size small. They didn't have it so I'll ordered the snake print instead. Bummer! Different leggings? Too much polyester in the fabric, feels awful to wear it when you sweat. I missed the return date so I ended up tossing them in the garbage."
1.0,Fell apart after two uses!
1.0,Unfortunately these were not winners in my book. They fit nicely and are very comfortable until you put on shoes. They either slipped or bunched up at the heels. I added a photo of them bunching at the heels. I tend to wear these types of socks with slip on flats or another time of flat shoe. I attempted to wear them with boots one time and it was a total fail. Not sure why I tried that. I don't like wearing boot socks because my feet get hot and swell.
1.0,The pattern on the bottom looks like your privates have teeth.  Kind of scary looking.  You can't really see it in this picture.
1.0,"These were so small and tight they didn‚Äôt even fit my 11 year olds who are, size wise, around 8. I had to return them immediately."
1.0,I really like how they feel on my feet very cushy but my feet sweat a little and that‚Äôs a bummer. I still wear them every morning.
1.0,"Really small, returned"
1.0,"This is how my watch came;<br />Out of the package;<br />A piece of crap item & I‚Äôll be expecting a refund when I mailed it yesterday..,broken... real crap"
1.0,I should have listened to the one review because this wire chain is extremely thin. I was very disappointed because I have one in yellow gold but also wanted one in white gold. I returned it the next day.
1.0,Did not fit my wife's Samsung galaxy watch active
1.0,I ordered a size and a half up and my daughter still couldn‚Äôt  get these on her feet. I‚Äôm highly annoyed!
1.0,broke the day I received these. the owl/ bird charm fell off an hour after I put it on. Poor Quality
1.0,"it came in a small package, broken and no extra pieces to fix it. this is a you get what you pay for deal, very upset"
1.0,"It turned black right away, after first use!"
1.0,"From waist down, way too tight"
1.0,Not worth it.  Cheap material and fits awkward.
1.0,I was very disappointed in the smallness of the fit and the quality of the item in general.
1.0,Not only did it turn on me but I washed my hands and the stone turned clear wasn't even a real stone.  The blue was nicer in the picture. Mine was an ugly blue color. But I couldn't believe that the stone turned.
1.0,Just awful. This dress is at least two sizes smaller than the label says. I ordered true to size as suggested and couldn‚Äôt even get it on all the way. Waste of money.
1.0,"Need photo corrected, currently shows a Bluetooth shower speaker"
1.0,"SKIP. As other reviewers have said, it‚Äôs thin. Seamless is correct as the top and bottom have no hem. Very much not what I was expecting and I bought 2.<br /><br />Here is about the only way I see using these-to hold a medical style mask in place to give my ears a break. Or as a headband I can quickly convert to a face mask that leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />Almost too tight to wear around my neck. I *may* be able to use it as a thin scarf in the winter.<br /><br />But while I may find a few uses for them, had I seen it first I would have never bought them and I‚Äôll be very cautious of buying from this company in the future over this quality."
1.0,Super bad quality. Literally like it was made for a child.
1.0,I got it because I‚Äôm pregnant. It‚Äôs not useful at all.
1.0,flimsy and don't stay put
1.0,Damage glasses without things
1.0,Poor quality and bad fit
1.0,Gave to my nephew who had it less than 2 months - the cover came off holding the face and pieces. Watch still works but cant put the piece back on. It states they repair/fix/replace but I filed a claim and did not hear anything back and its been a couple months. Not cool Amazon.
1.0,"Once installed, these springbars are impossible to remove from most modern watch cases. The dimensions are wonky. The springbars are very, very tight for the advertised lug width.<br /><br />The release edges are impossible to grab with a standard watch tool. The only ways to remove the springbars are drilling holes into the lugs, or sawing the springbars down."
1.0,the glass appear different that picture.. seam not sure of how I feel.
1.0,"I ordered what I thought was a blouse in a sheer polka-dot fabric. Instead the fabric was a heavy, opaque polyester crepe and reminded me of something I might have seen during the synthetic fabric heyday of the early 1980s. This was not at all what I ordered. Quality control is poor, evidently. Caveat emptor."
1.0,"I checked the chart and read reviews and ordered a size up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô, 103 pounds and a medium was skin tight. It‚Äôs being returned."
1.0,"There is no stretch, it is a child medium! I wear small in Victoria Secret and this medium is like &#34;nope you're not a kid and you're fat!&#34;"
1.0,Nothing like description way to small
1.0,Submitted order for personalization but came blank
1.0,Zero form to this. Looks like a sack. Nothing like the photo. Wished my husband would have asked me prior to purchasing this piece of garbage
1.0,Made of some stretchy fabric that is see through. They are comfortable though.<br />I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them as being useful to protect the wearer or those in front from the virus.
1.0,Don't know what went wrong.  It this is utterly small. My son of 15 doesn't even fit. Then the inner sleeve color wasn't white. It was blue. And all the button holes where closed. Cheap Chinese rubbish.
1.0,"The rings run small not true size! This is the second pair I bought furst it was 10 mens/ 7 womens, the 7 fit. Then I  ordered 12 mens /7 womens and they‚Äôre both too small! This second 7 didn‚Äôt fit! Very disappointed<br />They only refunded HALF the cost of this!<br />DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!"
1.0,It was very small and cheap. It in my opinion isn't worth the money. I would of sent it back but didn't want to easte postage
1.0,"Very, very small. Usually wear XL ordered XXL fit like a large with no stretch in material. Brown buttons on navy and white dress made it look very cheap."
1.0,The padding made the bra unusable.
1.0,Nice glasses; had to return; too big for my face
1.0,"Yep, not as advertised at all. Receieved 3 garment bags, none of them had straps in them to secure clothing. No drawstring bag and three useless envelope type bags. I checked the photos and the description, this was absolutely not delivered as advertised. What a waste of time. Additionally there is no way the zippers on these bags would hold up for one trip let alone many."
1.0,"After putting it on for the first time, my granddaughter was quietly coloring. Within an hour, the chain had come apart at the catch which meant it could not be fixed. I think the chain is too fine to be sold for a child to wear. I have bought less expensive chains that held up much better."
1.0,Such a pretty necklace but pretty small.
1.0,The material is weird. More like a swimsuit cover than a dress.
1.0,Decorative sash that came with it br9ken before taken from bag. Not even glued on the part its supposed to be on.  High disappointed and jammed into a very small bag.
1.0,"Total junk. I am not talking about the fit, I am talking about how much of a PITA it is to change the spring with a g-shock. Seriously, just buy a new watch. Do not waste your time or effort trying to replace the band with these adapters. My old band broke on one side and I had to rip the other side out because the spring would not come loose. You cannot get the tool in properly to replace the spring with these adapters. G-shock has gone through A LOT of trouble to make their bands nearly impossible to change so they can make profit off you buying another watch. The same goes for the exact band for the watch, same problem. Too much hassle and not worth the effort. Just buy a new watch, and not a g-shock. I had mine since 2015, but it has always had some problems so I will never go with g-shock again."
1.0,These are so small a pack of cigarettes barely fit
1.0,"EXTREMELY STIFF, PLUS THE CLASP IS AN EXTREMELY CHEAP PLASTIC CLASP THAT DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL AT ALL.  I WILL SEE IF IT ACTUALLY HELPS WITH THE STIFFNESS. BUT AS FOR THE CLASP VERY CHEAP HARD TO UN-HOOK AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HOOK BY YOURSELF,  ENTIRE BRACELET IS VERY STIFF."
1.0,"Product says it‚Äôs supposed to be surgical stainless steel and will not tarnish, but I‚Äôve had one of their rings in my nose for two days and it‚Äôs tarnishing, I can smell the smell of metal, and my piercing hole is weeping with goo now. I‚Äôve had my nose pierced for over 6 months and I‚Äôve never had a problem with any other rings. Will be returning product promptly!<br /><br />Update: I removed this tarnished stud and immediately tried inserting the stud I previously wore and my piercing hole was closed!! There was no forcing it through and was causing too much pain. In addition to the refund, this company should also refund me the cost of my piercing because putting their portly made product into my nose cost me my entire piercing."
1.0,This is not an RBX sweatshirt. Looks nothing like the shirt pictured. It does not have an RBX tag either. I call fraud! Returned promptly.
1.0,This bra was the most painful uncomfortable bra I‚Äôve ever tried on.
1.0,Look really nice other than they arrived with one of the clasps broken. Will be sending back for an exchange.
1.0,"Purchased this shirt for my daughter to wear to her Honors Choir Performance in Louisville, Ky. Had her try the shirt one before we left New Orleans to ensure she could fit it. Well today I took the tag off and started to iron the shirt and saw a tiny hole on the back center of the shirt and another tiny hole in the bottom center of the shirt. I've take the tag off the shirt and since the concert is tomorrow and we are no where near a mall, she will have to wear the shirt. Since she has to wear it, I'm quite sure I won't be able to return this shirt. It's a shame that she won't be able to wear this shirt again because most likely the holes will get larger over time!! Also there was a black mark/stain on the sleeve. It was such a cute shirt but will end up being a total waste of money because she will only be able to wear it one time. If there were no holes or stain I would give this shirt a 5 star rating bc it's very cute and the material is very nice."
1.0,Ive tried everything to get this band to fit. Even watched you tube video. This band just does not fit my watch üò°
1.0,Nice chain but too large for young man it's a nice chain.
1.0,No luce como la foto
1.0,i loved the idea of these trunks for my office loving hubby. everything about them was great. they are just way way too short.
1.0,These wad up into a ball as soon as you wash them.
1.0,Way to small .  I think it is made for a child/ teen.  Not an adult large . Very disappointed .
1.0,"These are not lightweight earrings, they were a lot larger and heavier than I expected. I agree that the hook is too thin to support the weight of the earring and it was quite sharp. I do not recommend these at all."
1.0,"This is NOT real silver! The silver wore off and turned my finger green! Im very disappointed! When I tried to get a refund, they claimed there was no order but clearly I have the ring!!"
1.0,This barely fits five big G shock watches. Was a waste  of money and it took forever to get here from Japan.  G shock watches are thick and big and this case is not for that type. Huge disappointment. Don't buy this.
1.0,"This is the worst thing I have ever ordered from Amazon. What a seriously awful item. The gloves do not even come close to fitting because of how jacked up the fingers were sewn and they arrived with a hole in the seam. The dress is beyond terrible, the white fabric is see through and the collar is so tight that I had to cut the front of the shirt to even get it on my daughter. The fabric is a terrible stretchy fabric that runs if you pull on it. The bows came with safety pins to pin to the shirt and guess what?!? The pins make the dang fabric run. The boot sock things don‚Äôt stay up at all and are of course terrible fitting. Extremely disappointed in my purchase and a total waste of money."
1.0,"No. Just no.  This is just awful.  There is ZERO quality here, and I used the size chart to order, but it is easily 3 sizes too big. Honestly, this article is horrendous."
1.0,I'm 5'1 and 118 to 120lbs. This was way too long and it was thin. I dont know if it is even possible to wear underwear. It's also ribbed. I just think it looks cheap instead of classy. Sending it back.
1.0,"I tried it and after 5 min I realized that one of the pom-pom was missing, poor quality product."
1.0,Awful!! It‚Äôs like plastic!!
1.0,"BEAUTIFUL<br />PURCHASED IN THREE COLOR, I LIKE IT SO WELL THAT I DECIDED TO ORDER IN LARGER SIZE<br />CAN'T SPEAK TO COMFORT SINCE I DID NOT WEAR.<br />GAVE ONE STAR ONLY BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO WEAR"
1.0,Worked great for 2 weeks and now it‚Äôs falling apart. The pin that holds the band together fell off now it‚Äôs unusable and of course the return window closed on the 3rd or this month.
1.0,very very very thin and flimsy
1.0,The pants were bell bottoms
1.0,"These shoe laces were 47‚Äù in length, not the 39‚Äù size ordered."
1.0,"As soon as I opened the package! It smelled sooo horrible!!! The stench that from it was unbearable! I don‚Äôt know if it was used, or dragged through the sewer! I<br /> Sooo sad about it.. because I‚Äôve been waiting to incorporate it into my workouts! Sad day for me!"
1.0,"Horrible fit. No top support, ran small and made cheap."
1.0,You get what you pay for with these boots! I wore them for 1 shift at work and the zipper split 4 times. Sending them back today.
1.0,"It doesn't seem many people have compained about the quality of this item, which i find very suprising.<br /><br />PROS:<br />I like that they are contoured so you can open your eyes with them on.<br />Fairly good deal for pack of two<br /><br />CONS:<br />There is a small gap on the out rim of your nose with these, I do have a fairly petite nose so that's probably the problem, if this was the only issue though than I probably would have kept the product.<br />The ear plugs you get with these are useless. They do not block a sound. BARELY even muffles noises. A GMP compliant pair works much better.<br />The bag that comes with these is useless. Its tough, CHEAP &#34;fabric&#34;.<br />Which leads to the overall problem of the eye mask. It is so CHEAPLY made. Pulling open the Velcro felt like I was going to rip it off. This product will not last. If you need something for a one time use, then this might fit the bill; but otherwise these will not last. Seriously though, it feels like a dollar store product."
1.0,Its like 20 inches long .... cannot see the whole design if wearing it... dont waste your time or money..
1.0,Bought these and on the first day they stretched out so much.
1.0,"Cute dress, however it's too thin to wear. Might be good as a swim suit coverup."
1.0,"Never received my mask, hopefully Amazon will refund my money from the seller."
1.0,"Too large, coarse material, not as expected, returned ü•¥"
1.0,"Very disappointed! These are not fitted at all & very see through. The fit on the legs is very loose, would prefer a tighter fit on the legs. Will be wearing these to sleep in only!!"
1.0,"The ""red"" is not actually red. They are NEON ORANGE."
1.0,These socks are sized for about a women's size 4.  I am a size 10.5W-11W and can barely put these on.
1.0,Its cute but it broke as soon as i tried to put my keys on it
1.0,"Honestly this bathing suit is fit more for a Junior, unless you have a small bust and a short torso I'm sure it would fit. I'm 5'7 125-30 lbs and it didn't fit at all. My boobs would have been falling ou the sides."
1.0,Cheap material will not buy again
1.0,Stupid not UV protectant.
1.0,Looks so cute on the model- run very large. Normally I wear a small normally and ordered a small this fit like a large medium.
1.0,"Do not go by the colors they display, they are not even close to what you will get.  I ordered one color and got something not even close to the picture.  You would think something like getting the colors right wouldn‚Äôt be that difficult but I guess it is."
1.0,I've tried to purchase these socks twice and each time I received XXL instead of S/M
1.0,It's Beautiful but always size up...
1.0,The item sizes bigger than it Is showing
1.0,Wish they fit
1.0,Balls were all to small rip off would give it zero stars if I could
1.0,Dull and very cheap feeling and looking.
1.0,Wouldn't recommend them.
1.0,this one is so different then the picture<br />cheap and bad and ugly copy<br />and it's really not as described<br />it's not even look like the picture<br />UGLY
1.0,A faulty charm unable to fit on Pandora bracelet
1.0,"It‚Äôs way too loose fitting, fabric feels strange to the touch. Not a very comfortable fabric"
1.0,they are HEAVY. and the backs don't stay on.
1.0,I gave this 1 star because I liked the designs and adjustable ear loops....however.....I wore this at work and my face was sloppy wet all day. They say they are soft and cotton. They definately have no cotton whatsoever in this mask
1.0,It was very pretty just not sized right. No give in lace that fits over hips.
1.0,This is a cute top but sizing is way off.  The large is more like a small.
1.0,Broken Bracelet and looks like has been used for few months. Be aware!!!
1.0,I don't think this solid black was the same as the printed one I got. The material was much thinner than the other one. This one had no molded cups like the other. And the straps had little to no tension especially compared to the other.
1.0,the leather peeled off the outside of the shoe the first time I wore them.
1.0,"La camisa queda s√∫per hermosa, pero de busto me quedo peque√±a."
1.0,Bought this for a Bridesmaid dress that was very low cut in the front door. It BARELY stuck on for 2mins-I literally tried everything to get it to stay on. I ended up just using bandaids (super classy)...soooo not worth a penny
1.0,"this is the cheapest ugliest ring i have ever purchased, in the pictures it looks super pretty but this literally looks worse then a children's play ring."
1.0,crap. they fall apart on you..
1.0,Cheap and Wired Material....No waist band included.<br />LATE REFUND...SO BAD
1.0,Product was super thin and way to big I ordered a large for it to be comfortable and it was like a 1X on me!
1.0,Not true 2X
1.0,"It is too small. Apparently if you are big in other places, you have to have big breasts. It is tight in all the wrong areas. I wore it for a wedding and will never wear it again. It looks just like the pic, except some bridesmaids had longer ""sleeves"" than just the ""caps"". Not sure why. The back is lilac colored mesh. I'm 5'4"" and it was very long. Kicking it out in front of me just wasn't enough."
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt look like advertised
1.0,The length was too short. Almost like a belly shirt.
1.0,Not a beanie! Very dissatisfied!
1.0,Not of good quality. Wore it maybe twice and charms began to fall off
1.0,The lace detail was barely on o  one side and had way to much on the other side of the v neck. If I could give lower than one star I would. It looked like a trash bag. Do not waste your money. I just sent mine back to be refunded. Idk if people still use this word but it was the definition of fugly and cheap
1.0,"This is way too small for the average adult head. It measures 8.75"" across.<br />Arrived late and was told just to have patience by the seller-even after paying $10 for shipping. Do not recommend."
1.0,"Super disappointed in this purchase. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô0 and the sleeves are way to short. The colors are super dull, the inside of the hood is white the string is way to long and the shirt had elbow pads that aren‚Äôt as pictured also the elbow pads aren‚Äôt even in the correct spot."
1.0,Very tight in the busy and I‚Äôm only a 36c ( xl) ordered
1.0,I didn't think it was going to be such a cheaply made item. It started falling apart after 2 weeks of use. I do not recommend.
1.0,Very poorly done. Example pictures looks good the actual product not so much.<br />The mask material is a thin poor quality material.<br />The only reason one start is because there wasn‚Äôt a choice for zero stars
1.0,Tarnished after 2 wears. I have bought a lot less expensive costume jewelry that has lasted a lot longer.
1.0,"Poor quality material, size is small, front does not fit, do not waste your money."
1.0,Buy an UA one for a bit more money.
1.0,Might have been cute if you were a small child! Super bummed that this was not good. Going back!!!
1.0,Mislabled.  3 sizes to big.  Sent back.  I don't think i would order from Russell again.  Sending order back too much hassle
1.0,The materials are poor. The buckle failed and my watch fell off my wrist.  The hole became enlarged and now I have to make it band tighter in order for it not to fall off. My watch is a nice Hamilton Titanium Khaki Field watch and I was not happy when the watch slammed to the floor.  I really don't like to write reviews but I had to on this one.  Tired of cheap Chinese manufacturing standards sponsored by US businesses.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and the quality is terrible.  So cheap looking.
1.0,I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the coarse material.  Also it‚Äôs not  flattering if you have any extra weight in the middle.
1.0,Bigger than stated. Too big to do anything with
1.0,To small and it seemed like an item i could have gotten at a 99 only
1.0,"The dress is cute, but not what I ordered. I ordered an elastic waist dress and what I got was a t-shirt dress. I'll keep it because it is a nice dress, just wish I got what I ordered."
1.0,"Fleecy, does not breathe.  Made cheaply."
1.0,"Did not fit as expected, too small and too short"
1.0,not lycra the print is terrible
1.0,I have many pair of these style glasses (different colors to match outfits).  These don‚Äôt have screws or nuts‚Ä¶they have a small rivet with a rubber cap ‚Äòpushed‚Äô on at bridge and ear joints that loosened and came apart within an hour of wearing.  I‚Äôll go back to paying more for other brands of this style‚Ä¶but these are seriously of less quality than you can get at the Dollar store.
1.0,"Ripoff. I should‚Äôve read reviews before purchasing. Paid over $20; worth a buck from the dollar store, just like everyone else said."
1.0,"Loved this but it just did not stay up. I got in my car and just sitting down, it was pulled back off my shoulders. Just walking a short distance it kept sliding off one shoulder or would not stay even on the shoulders. I have LOTS of these kimono type cardigans and never have this issue."
1.0,"Well, the style and comfort of the shoe is great, but the studs started coming out the 2nd day I wore them! :("
1.0,Very poor quality. I wouldn't recommend buying this umbrella.
1.0,It has broke again!
1.0,"Was torn when we received this item, completely broken the first time wearing. Item was sold out so no replacement was given"
1.0,I would not recommend it if you are looking  for support at the top. It looks like a cheap padded bra with strings attached. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"At first glance...Great quality , love the width... I'm a women with  wide feet  so I find mens flip flops to fit more comfortably... I'm a size 10 in women's shoes so I buy 8.5 in mens... I got these in 9 as they don't have half sizes and they're too small... they fit like size 9 in women's shoes... unfortunately,  these fell apart in less than a month ...ü•¥"
1.0,"This I figured would  be a waste of money, but for the  price was hopeful that it might surprise me.  The are flimsy,  and could not get them adjusted to see anything clearly.  Don't waste your money on them."
1.0,"Definitely not like the picture! The inside of the watch is brown not black! I needed an all brown watch so I'm keeping it, but I was very disappointed that it wasn't like the pic. The band material is cheap but I guess that's what u get for such a low price."
1.0,I got a med and it fit too small. I didn‚Äôt go up my butt I had to put it on over my head. Material is cheap quality and very see through. Maybe wearing it over a bathing suit but returning this. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this
1.0,This dress looks cheap and fits like an Asian size.
1.0,The dress was not anything like picture and took more than three weeks to arrive.  The dress did not appear like the picture.  The material was cheap and lace a different color than dress.  I had to pay for the return postage to China.  It was a disaster.
1.0,Too small and had run in one pair. Returned.
1.0,Dont really fit they way I like..too loos3
1.0,very cheap. pooringpackage
1.0,The dress was cute but it was too small. I returned it months ago and I‚Äôm still waiting on a refund!
1.0,Too small and it doesn't look anything like the pic
1.0,"I ordered two of these, set to be delivered two weeks before an event. They arrived three days after the event. On top of that the quality was not good. My underwear was completely visible underneath and the stitching was all frayed."
1.0,Wanted dress pants for work. These pants are not petite- 3-4 inches too long. Fit elsewhere was perfect. Will have to return.
1.0,The plastic bite clip disintegrated my first time using it and the small carabiner failed as well. I would not recommend this product.
1.0,This product is made very cheaply.  I put the gloves on for the first time and ripped them!  They are very tiny.  I am very unhappy with this product.  One size does NOT fit all.  These gloves are too small and could only fit a toddler.  I do not recommend these .  They are not worth the money.
1.0,"Bought this watch from there website, so dark and lacking contrast that its unusable. There return policy is also ass, and apparently taking the watch out of its box makes it nonexchangeable even when they sell you a watch unable to tell time because its unreadable. Probably other colors are fine but this one is not good and the company is a little skeezy in there returns."
1.0,The cross is extremely tiny and it slips through the ring constantly. This is pretty much unwearable. It also arrived with a broken link but i guess you can't expect anything more since it's so cheap.
1.0,There is so many things wrong with this cosplay.<br /><br />1. Wrong sizing<br />2. Horrible quality<br />3. A few pieces came in broken??<br />5. THE PANTS ARE WHITE WASHING<br /><br />This is horrible quality :( I was so happy when it arrived to see such trash
1.0,"Looks beautiful, but has poor quality. The heel hurts, as the sole is not padded well."
1.0,Returned them. Not made for walking. They are just for show. I needed shoes for my beginner walker! These were not it.
1.0,This is not an infinity scarf and it's too short to even tie around the neck. Returning disgusted.
1.0,"I bought them b/c of ""98% cotton"" in description.<br />Nowhere on the package it says ""cotton"".<br />They are not cotton socks. Mostly made of synthetic material.<br />I even don't need to try them  to know this is not breathable material.<br />I'm going to return them..."
1.0,Too small and can‚Äôt use them for anything really! Faces don‚Äôt look detailed.
1.0,Describing it was not accurate to what it is for. They don‚Äôt use actual peopl
1.0,I am writing this review because the cap I received is very different than what the listing shows. The fabric was very faded. The writing is different than what was advertised. The word Kind is in a different font and the front size is much smaller than advertised. You would not be able to read the words on the cap unless you were close to it. Just be aware that it is not the quality I expected and looks very different.
1.0,The zipper on these break very quickly and easily. I bought 2 of these and the zippers on both broke within 2 wears of each
1.0,"When this arrived inside the secure shipping box, the item was outside its own case just sliding around. Its case was damaged too. The device itself was scratched up, so it was probably returned at some point.<br /><br />As for the device itself, it lights up when you touch it, but doesn‚Äôt recognize your hand moving close to it like it claims to. Absolute disgrace of a delivery and product. Returning."
1.0,Stopped working after a day of use. Wouldnt recommend it
1.0,They give no lift or support and the adhesive comes loose extremely easily do not and let me repeat DO NOT buy these
1.0,Came from 'Carol Wright'. Front snaps are poorly aligned and cause the front to pucker ans gap all the way down.  Very hard scratchy tag and yoke/sleeves are small for a medium.
1.0,The description said they were small and delicate but instead they were large and heavy. I was very disappointed with them.
1.0,Its not 14k as it say on the picture..its just fake!
1.0,"Not what I expected at all. Says for thick hair but these are the smallest, thinnest hair ties out there."
1.0,These are cheap and broke the first time trying it on.. I would never buy again and Do Not Recommend this Product at all. Not worth the money. Dissatisfied!
1.0,"When the package arrived, the 3 panties were in a plastic bag, however when I removed them the black pair color had left color marks all over the beige and pink. I thought that it would wash out, however after washing the underwear, they all still have black marks all over them. I understand that it is just under garments, however it looks terrible. Especially when you buy NEW underwear."
1.0,"Great wallet, holds all my stuff perfectly. Even better price.<br />Updating my review. The wallet does not hold up well. The material has frayed all around and the zipper pocket has come apart. Really disappointed."
1.0,"Watch unexplainably stopped working. After further inspection, it appears the second hand dislodged from the watch movement and jammed the minute and hours hands in place. Do not have explanation for this malfunction? I desire to return the watch. Thank you"
1.0,"The dress looked cheap,  the split was not where it was in the picture.  I purchased 2 sizes and still didn't like it"
1.0,"They're tight to the point they cut off circulation but provide little to no support.  The actual product isn't even remotely like the item in the picture.  What you see is a very nice item, looks like it wouldn't be out of place on an athlete.  What you get is a tiny piece of elastic.  Might as well tie a rubber band around my finger.  Thanks for nothing."
1.0,Received different color and it was too big. Very disappointed and returned it!
1.0,"Lol if your body doesn't look like hers, don't buy. Lmao this literally squeezed my belly fat into sections"
1.0,This is so small it's hard to identify as an elephant. Returned.
1.0,Pure garbage! very cheap. Broke after a few wears
1.0,You know it's cheap when it doesn't even have a label telling you how to wash it. The texture of Kleenex.  Returned.
1.0,the pants were nice but they were too small
1.0,Nice bra. Front closure made of cheap plastic
1.0,My issue was that it lost all shape after the first wash. Be sure to wash by hand in cold water if you want to get more life out of it
1.0,Shoelaces eyelits broke first time on
1.0,"I'm really disappointed with the quality of these sunglasses. I buy pairs like these all the time and these lasted not even a full week before getting permanent scratches and blemishes. I've never had this issue with other inexpensive glasses. The mirroring on the lenses are completely rubbed away in the middle, but I have always kept them in their case when not in use and I don't touch them excessively.  They were great when I first got them but now it's not even worth trying to return them. What a waste of money!"
1.0,didn't look good in the back at all
1.0,Purchased white and its a disgisting yellow-beige color. Also the material feela like plastic coated gauze.
1.0,I returned poor quality for the price and poor fitting
1.0,I bought a belt two sizes up and it still didn‚Äôt reach around my waist.  What a waste of money.
1.0,"Description indicated ""heirem""legged...was not enen hemmed at all."
1.0,Everything is soaked. Material on the outside is certainly waterproof but the zippers where everything is supposed to seal off is def not and important of mine document wise is now wet.
1.0,This sweater is such a gross scratchy material and fits funny. It is not at all how it is in the picture. I am returning.
1.0,"If you have a butt, these will be too short. Might as well wear them as underwear. I ordered an XL and they're more like a size L. Not worth the hassle of returning."
1.0,Please see the pictures - the sole is coming off after 2 months only.
1.0,"The belt loops were not lined up evenly, so the belt was very crooked. Had to send the coat back!"
1.0,Not True too size
1.0,"Disliked, feels cheaper than expected. Medium felt tight, shirts run small and do not feel comfortable wearing."
1.0,"It looks great in the pictures but in reality, it looks extremely cheap and tacky. I regret wasting my money on this and hope that others read this review, so that they wont make the same mistake that I did.<br /><br />I tried even to alter it and there was just no way to make it look any better.<br /><br />The bows immediately fell off of the stockings. They were simply hot glued on.<br /><br />The ears and the choker were the only thing I liked and would reccomend but surely not over $40 dollars."
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt look ANYTHING like the Stewart tartan pattern in Amazons photo. I‚Äôd look like a huge ridiculous elf if I wore this. Sending it back.
1.0,"has hole, nothing like picture"
1.0,It might be more stars if I ever get it!
1.0,Way small definitely not plus size at all.
1.0,"The slit goes straight up. I understand the concept of a wrap dress, but this was a joke. The slit went so far up you could literally see my underwear.  The fabric is thin and sheer. I was very disappointed and returned this item right away."
1.0,"not worth 2 $.  It is the cheapest piece of junk.  It does not look anything like the picture.  The picture looks nice, but instead you get a cheep plastic with glass over it with a paper pictue underneath of the jedi order symbol.  Do not buy it.  NOT worth the money."
1.0,Band slips too easy.. And broke after 6 uses!
1.0,"POOR QUALITY! The fit guidance was accurate. I usually wear a small and ordered a large and the fit was fine.  Not a big fan of the fabric but could have lived with it if the garment was well made, which it definitely is not. The side seams at the bottom stick straight out like wings and the seams are rolled on the bottom edge front & back."
1.0,"The zipper broke literally the first time I used it. As I zipped it up after packing a reasonable amount of items in the bag, the zipped portion started opening up in the middle of the bag."
1.0,Opened it..... Inflated it..... Multiple pin holes.... Trash. 1 star because you have to give one
1.0,Very disappointed reviews are very small this belt is way to small I purchased an Xl and received a small size can't even get it around my waist not good to mislead customers like this
1.0,Too small for medium fits as xsmall and very long pants. I even cant try and my size is 8. I bought before from this company and have no problem with sizes. But to return you have to pay shipping and insurance charges what was $7.20.
1.0,hasta las huevas
1.0,"Bought this for Running and when i took it out of the box and was checking out the light, i couldn‚Äôt put it back in the beanie securely. The hole is bigger than the light. I don‚Äôt trust it to stay in place and not fall out when Running. I am returning this ASAP."
1.0,No sanitary seal in the panty of the swimsuit so I am sending it back. I have no idea how it fits because of sanitary concerns I did not try it on.
1.0,I have purchased 3 housedresses in the past year (slow learner) and each one has either come apart at the zipper or a snap has fallen off.  Over $80 wasted!
1.0,"I bought this thinking it came with all the characters specifically big bird for my daughter's bday and it came with 4 that's it, I'm very dissatisfied."
1.0,"They are flat. They look and feel cheap and the color is weird. Once I find out how to get my money back I will update this rating.<br /><br />Nov. 16th. I have asked 3 times now, and no one has gotten back to me. No response. Their guarantee seems to be a joke"
1.0,THIS WAS NOT FOR AN ADULT AS LISTED AND BROKE WHEN TRYING TO STRETCH IT
1.0,"The ring was pretty when I recieved it. Although, it looked fake (I know, but I didn't think it would look so fake), I loved it. It was a sweet, simple design. However, it started rusting and discoloring two days into owning/having it. I feel like I just wasted a 11 bucks..."
1.0,I was so excited about this necklace but it tarnished after the first time I wore it. Took longer to return it than I had it.
1.0,Needs to have adjustable straps that are LONGER.  Returned
1.0,Looks nothing like on the picture!!!!!!! The material is cheap and the design is just as ridiculous. I need my money back
1.0,"I thought only the bill would be huge, but the whole cap is huge. It'll only fit a waterhead."
1.0,NOT A STICKER...it uses static to cling to glass. Boo.
1.0,"It took several weeks to receive this item in the mail and once I did get it, I tried to put it on both sleeves were sewn shut at the ends therefore my arms were unable to go through. Also there are huge gaps in between the fur and too much fabric is exposed. Very pretty style but highly disappointed with the way it‚Äôs made and sheds way too much. I will be returning this item and hopefully the next one will be sewn correctly so it can be worn."
1.0,Fabric was very cheap. Almost see thru. Not the quality needed for athletic wear.
1.0,"Loved this the first time I wore it - then I washed it - and now it is short enough for my toddler daughter to wear as a shirt....Didn't shrink in width - only length - and wow, did it ever shrink..."
1.0,We couldn't use it.  The material is rough and has no stretch to it. My baby was 6 pounds9 ounces and it was tight in her head. The long and skinny shape looked funny because there was a lot of extra material sticking over her head.
1.0,"10% restocking fee for a product that does not fit as specified, and no returns. The Watch span CAN'T BE REMOVED WITHOUT RIPPING THE LEATHER. A total misrepresentation."
1.0,They came early however they are very poor quality
1.0,"Packaging was beautiful and I anticipated an equally impressive product. Sadly, that was not the case. The pearls had sunken in holes and beads like when plastic is melting. I was very disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,"The earrings were very disappointing.  Very small and terrible quality so do not recommend anyone wasting their money, even as cheap as they are.  Frankly, I would be happier paying twice the price for better a quality product."
1.0,These are really small for a small child not an adult like advertised
1.0,The ball piece that connects the belt broke in 3 days.
1.0,"Much, much smaller than expected.  I normally wear a M.  I ordered a L due to the reviews.  Still way to small.  Also, looked cheaply made.  Sending back."
1.0,DON'T buy these especially if you plan to splash salt water on them it takes mirror coating off who thought it would be a bad idea to wear sunglasses at the beach
1.0,This does not work.<br />1.  My ring still slips and twists<br />2.  The tabs catch on my clothes<br />3.  The tabs scratched my face<br />4.  The tabs are uncomfortable<br /><br />Do not buy.  Not even worth the small amount of money.
1.0,First time wearing 4 swings and it ripped!!
1.0,"Terrible, it toke 2months1 week to get them , smelling glue ,never again"
1.0,"If I didn't pay so little for it, I would send it back. It would cost me more in postage then what I paid for it. It has popped off more times then I can count. It's say 8&#34; but you really have to have a small wrist. After coming off so much I put it in the garbage. Best place for it."
1.0,Item was smaller than expected. Second outer strap became loose after wearing the sports bra and washing it 3 times
1.0,"These are not clip on earrings as advertised.  They are pinch on; there is not clip mechanism.<br />False advertising.  I would send them back for a refund, but that is too much trouble and just not worth<br />the effort.  Do not buy these.  They fall right off after you squeeze them on to your ear lobe."
1.0,"Good idea, poor execution. The fabric is soft and nice, but the way this bra designed makes you wonder what went wrong. The front part is sewn weird, feels uncomfortable on the breasts and keeps sliding up with the slightest of movements. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1.0,"It‚Äôs 6 pieces, not pairs & not worth the money I spent!"
1.0,It hasn't even been a year and it stopped working.
1.0,Fell apart after one day. Literally took it out of the package and wore it the next day and it broke. You always get what you pay for.
1.0,"I wear a L to XL in yoga pants. I bought XL. First of all they are not stretchy and second, they fit like a small. Since they don't stretch, I couldn't get them over my thighs or my feet."
1.0,Geneva Elite watch faces will say so on the face.  This collection is a cheaper line sold at the cost of the better Geneva Elite.  One was even the wrong brand.  Do not trust ExcellentWatchesInc.
1.0,Too large. Band was bent very badly. Maybe caused during shipping. They arent very secure.
1.0,"I would give them zero stars if I could. I ordered 1 pair as gift and they were amazing, so I used the amazon function, ""order again"" but this time got a pair of greenish globs. I posted a review directly to the manufacturer's website and no surprise, they never published it.... what a disgrace...<br /><br />I suggest passing on these...."
1.0,"You will be lucky if these fit a newborn, very small"
1.0,Much smaller frames than expected!
1.0,I returned this dress for a couple of different reasons. The material was very cheap and see through. And it was WAY too short!
1.0,Not comfortable at all. Ended up sending them back.
1.0,it was not two tone it is a solid color not happy with this one
1.0,Ugly and itchy
1.0,"Extremely trash product will rip if wind blows, can only be worn once.  Absolutely üíØ worst I've ever seen. Not worth a dollar!!!!!"
1.0,"It's very disappointing. When these shoes arrived they had a white looking substance on them & Also they look very old. I would've returned this item but unfortunately, I order these through a shipping company that ships items out of the USA."
1.0,"The ties for the sleeves of the shirt that I received were not the same length.  One was too short to tie at the bottom (it was barely long enough to even lace the sleeve) and the other was long, but not long enough to cut in half.  Very disappointing!  I tried to return it, but couldn't."
1.0,You have to hand wash and the fit it snug. Make sure to go up a size or two. The shirt fabric feels really cheap.
1.0,Too short‚Ä¶ and definitely NOT knee-high.
1.0,"The thread holding on the front pocket unraveled with just a couple hours of first wear. I would have<br />tried to sew back on but I didn't want to go through the hassle of finding the correct color thread because the whole thing was just poor quality. I got it as a loose, cute dress to wear as a new post-partum nursing mom. I like the cut and style a lot, but: the fabric wrinkles super easily and stays wrinkled; if it gets wet at all it leaves a mark on the material after drying (not good if you get a couple of drops of milk from nursing or a toddler comes to give you a kiss and drools on you); the buttonholes stretched out A LOT just from unbuttoning 3x the first time wearing it (the dress was large on me and not clingy at all). I want to love this and I want to keep it, but with all of this together, it just won't work for me. Unfortunately, I have to return it because it's just very poor quality!"
1.0,Strings and such coming loose. The strap is detaching from the first wash!! Unwearable
1.0,"The product says it fits wrist sizes from 5.5""-8.5"". I have a 6.375"" wrist and the clasp goes beyond its smallest wrist-size indentation. The smallest sized wrist seems to measure around 6.5"". If your wrist is 6.5"" or larger then this would make a very nice wristband."
1.0,The jacket does not fit correctly. The zipper is so weak that it fell off after 3 weeks. It looks cute but it‚Äôs not worth the money. Don‚Äôt buy.
1.0,The way it was made
1.0,Zipper doesn't lock in place.
1.0,De nuevo me mandaron el n√∫mero equivocadoüòñ
1.0,Nesecito el renbolso lo nomand√© ase tres semanas
1.0,Looks cheap. Cheaply made.
1.0,lol these are the junkiest pieces of crap I've ever had the misfortune of buying.
1.0,Looks cheap. Waste of money.
1.0,These are scratchy and feel cheap. Was really hoping for a comfy pair of sweats! Also they show the gray with pink writing but send gray with white writing! I did not notice it states white writing until I went back to see if I ordered incorrectly. It doesn't read the description when reading from your phone! These will definitely be returned!
1.0,I bought this in January of 2022.  Its now August 2022 and the strap tore off.  I take great care of it and don't do anything to put stress on it.  Not happy at all about it.
1.0,"There is no adjusting of the band behind the head.  There is a metal piece inside for shape and it is not adequately padded, so uncomfortable.  In short, its a simple product but is very cheaply made. I am returning it."
1.0,Tight and hot
1.0,"No me gusto el pantal√≥n, llego todo arrugado y h√∫medo al abrir el paquete, nada que ver con la foto."
1.0,About the only thing I liked is the price. I tried using it for the first time and it leaks out of the backpack from the fill up hole and the connection between the mouth piece and the tube. So half of my water leaked onto my back and side. The chest straps are not long enough to strap together and I'm a pretty skinny person. Over all very dissatisfied with the product but I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Arm openings aren't finished well.  Not very well made.
1.0,Broke when she put it on. One half if the sunflower fell right off could not find it
1.0,This is so large. I ordered a small and it fits like a medium or a large.
1.0,I returned these as fast as I ordered them. They were supposed to be a gift for my 10 year old niece. They would barely fit on an infant's earlobe.
1.0,Wore the glasses two times and they broke. The whole frame broke off of the side of the glasses. I can‚Äôt even wear them.
1.0,Doesnt really suck it in
1.0,Bought one jacket that I liked - the next one was manufactured differently - much poorer quality.
1.0,"This wallet is GINORMOUS. It is the size of at least three iphones stacked on top of each other. I came across this wallet looking for a reasonable replacement for my old beat up wallet and came across this. From the pics, there is no way to tell just how big this thing really is, so I bought it, not knowing what a surprise I was in for. Don't buy, unless you have the need to store stacks of cash from your off shore bank account."
1.0,Broke within a week. Its also very harsh metal. It was scratching my skin on my arm. Very cheap product.
1.0,"Has discoloration on the heart, looks like a big pink streak is smeared on it.  All the whit beads are marked with black that you have to go in and hand wipe off.  Just looks cheap.  Might just take the heart off because it looks so bad."
1.0,Missing an earring. Cheaply made. Earrings huge.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt fit me @ all had to send it back. Really wanted it though. May try again in a bigger size of
1.0,The band went ok but when I tried to remove it today the pin broke off and the band is now stuck. I have no choice but to cut the pin holding the strap into half.
1.0,so small and so cheap not worth it.  its a ring you adjusted to fit your finger. please  don't buy
1.0,That thing didn‚Äôt even fit around legs...probably the worst purchase I‚Äôve ever made.
1.0,THIS DRESS IS NOT A GOOD PURCHASE.<br />LACKS QUALITY
1.0,I bought it because I thought it had glitter on it. It does not!!!! Not at all what I thought it was. False description.
1.0,To small ordered a large need to go one or even two sizes up. Looked like they where made well though
1.0,Item came with an unseen hole in the side that expanded to the size of my head when I first put it on.
1.0,"I'm usually a fan of bags that have plenty of room. It took me a few weeks to realize the weight of the bag was actually causing shoulder pain. I was hoping that the bad itself would ""loosen up""- it's stiff material, but it never did."
1.0,Cheap as hell definitely not the pictured dress. Threads hanging off garnet before I even took them out of the bag. Somehow it‚Äôs too big and too small at the same time. Do not expect to get the free people dress!
1.0,"Thin, super small. Gave it away"
1.0,"These went straight in the trash. Not even worth a return. I bought 3 pink and 3 black. The padding was so deformed, smashed, and not good quality there's no way it would keep the wind out of my eyes. ZERO STARS IF I COULD."
1.0,Ran way too small.
1.0,"good wallet. can hold lots of cards.<br /><br />[Updating]<br />After using it for some time my wife hates this wallet. After filling cards on just one side, the wallet bulges from one side. No room for holding anything else.<br />Slots for cards are tight and leave limited grip to pull a card out."
1.0,Too thin ~ Just like a Thick T ~ Shirt material üòí
1.0,The shoes look and fit fine but the heel was shaking even I bought the low heels.
1.0,I was really disappointed in this bra. It's nothing but a swim suit top and made of swim suit material. Fit is poor and it's pretty baggy in the cage. I guess I can try and wear it swimming but it isn't comfortable as a bralette. Wouldn't recommend at all.
1.0,Had to return because the sizing is wrong.
1.0,Cheap thin leather! Do not waste your money on this cheap imitation!
1.0,mine quit working after 2 days china made junk!!!1
1.0,The fit is great just didnt look right
1.0,"When I first received this product I was super happy, these came in cute little container and the design is super cute. Unfortunately, I was only able to wear them for 2 days until my piercings were infected, oozing and painfully infected. I have had both bellybutton perising for over 15 years, so this is not an issue of an infected new piercing. I am now going on 1 week of healing these infections and they are just now starting to get better (less painful, less swollen, but still red and oozing). I am really leaving this review in hopes to warn anyone else from buying these. Super bummed, they are super cute, but I'm sorry, this seller is not being honest about the material these are made from."
1.0,I wear a Large. I washed it once and it fits like a medium now. Also the image quality is very low res. I can't wear it anymore after 2 washes
1.0,"What more is there to say? I wear my watch about 90% of the time and this band about 70% of days that I wear a watch. It didn't last 3 months.<br /><br />When I saw how easily it was to change without fooling with pins, I considered buying a bunch in different colors. I'm glad I didn't."
1.0,Did not like the material and sleeves too long  size small
1.0,Did not like them poor quality
1.0,Tight in hop area not true to size
1.0,Donor like the way this item fits this specific style glasses.
1.0,"I bought 2 as presents.  Total, TOTAL s***.  They came in a tangled mess and one clasp broke right away.  They are junk.  Do not buy."
1.0,"Caution before buying this watch...<br />The manufacturer obviously put the wrong length stem on this watch and did not realize it UNTIL the watch bands were put in place.  This watch was NOT designed to have to use this tiny little sewing machine screw driver in order to set it, as depicted in the bottom picture.  I HAVE one of these watches--probably from a different batch using the proper length stem.  What you cannot see in the pictures is that the metal watch face actually has a semi-circle notch underneath for the end of the stem to fit.  The problem is, these watches have a much-too-short stem which doesn't come close to making it through the notch in the face.  As a result, it is impossible to get at the end of the stem in order to set it or push it in.  The bottom picture makes it seem possible, but I cannot reach it with any implement on the two new watches I was sent.<br /><br />This is a neat watch.  Though it is BIG.  Make sure you know how large it is before ordering.  But I would strongly advise against purchasing this watch until the vendor gets it straightened out with the supplier.  This watch is NOT designed to have to use a tiny screwdriver to set it."
1.0,They're stretchy but I've had them for a little over a week and there is holes  forming in the inner thigh area. They're thin and don't hold up well. Not worth the money.
1.0,Poor quality cheaply made
1.0,Fake. Worse and waste of money.
1.0,Ordered black but a dark grey showed up. The material was of poor quality and it smelled of harsh chemicals.
1.0,It‚Äôs not the bright red it shows. More of a burnt orange color
1.0,"After wearing the socks for about an hour, it already ripped. Wasn‚Äôt doing any strenuous or vigorous workouts, just ran an errand and came home.<br /><br />And for reference, I wear a size 7.5 women‚Äôs<br /><br />Disappointed these don‚Äôt last even a day."
1.0,"The zipper wouldn't even unzip , for me to be able to try on the dress.. disappointing dress"
1.0,Says it‚Äôs a sparkle/glitter TANK TOP however I got a shiny T-SHIRT
1.0,Item got holes in them after 2 games of wearing .  Not worth the money.
1.0,Not the color advertised.. I bought the dark charcoal and received a very light grey. Not the same as in the picture... I returned it.
1.0,This ring is huge and ugly. Not what I ordered.
1.0,THE SWEATER LOOKED VERY NICE WHEN RECEIVED BUT THE SEAM ON THE LEFT SHOULDER CAME APART AFTER I WORE IT ONCE. I SEWED IT UP AND THEN A WEEK LATER THE SEAM ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER CAME APART.  NOT HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE.
1.0,"Looked decent in pictures but upon arrival was poorly put together. The ""leather"" strap was almost like plastic. The toy versions made of foam are built better. Missing pieces, seemed banged up and probably used. Don't often return items or write reviews but really had to for this one. Would not recommend even for half price."
1.0,This was a Valentine's day gift for my daughter.<br />The cat earing was poor quality and the packaging was worse.
1.0,"Even though the belt is XL size,it won't suit a person with XL size. I have worn it only three times and it has already got much-scarred and pocked. Extremely poor quality."
1.0,One cup is noticeably smaller than the other without putting it on I knew it was off. I love the color & other than the messed up cut of the bra I like the style of it.
1.0,"I thought this pendant was. Igger, but it‚Äôs very tiny. Perhaps my fault I didn‚Äôt read the description carefully. I returned it."
1.0,Stitching ripped out after only wearing about 2 weeks.
1.0,Very thin t-shirt material.
1.0,Way too heavy and they look cheap. I‚Äôm not happy at all with this purchase. Don‚Äôt waste your money on these earrings!
1.0,"I bought them for my family members for Christmas, and when they all tried to put the on, they were all too small. I wanted to return them, but they were gifts that I gave and couldn‚Äôt take back."
1.0,"Ring looked great out of the box and very nice packaging. After 1 month of wear, the silver plating is worn off and ring now looks copper."
1.0,"I loved the dress but after 1washing on yhe GENTLE cycle and hanging up to dry, it has little pin holes all over it! I am so disappointed! 1 star for quality is too much."
1.0,I like my workout shirts loose but this tank seems too big  to be a L.
1.0,Garbage..... Fit isn't right. Material is garbage
1.0,This dress is completely see through. We bought the dark red color and I hoped since it was darker in color that it would help but that was not the case. The quality is probably the worst of any dress I have ever purchased. Highly disappointed. I am returning this dress.
1.0,"Too narrow to be comfortable.  Also, instep rubs on top strap.  Wanted to return them but couldn't find invoice, so I guess I'm stuck with them."
1.0,No me agrado mucho.
1.0,One of the stones fell out after 2 months and I emailed the company and got no response.
1.0,"Very disappointed, the fabric was awful."
1.0,Xl at best way to small
1.0,"So disappointed. First of all, the stone was so big that it didn't look real. Secondly, I barely got to wear this even a month because the center stone fell out as well as two of these small stones."
1.0,This is garbage! The decal came off in the wash. I want my money back asap. Do not waste your time or money.
1.0,"No quality,"
1.0,Initially was good but it broke apart 4 months after purchase.
1.0,The shorts are very BIG and top is very SMALL!! But was a very low price. I think it would cost more to ship it back than what i paid.
1.0,Did not have the screw back that is advertised!
1.0,This was an item of poor quality and we regret buying it
1.0,Way too small. Not true to size.
1.0,Cats eye fell out the first day of wearing it!!! Not happy with the product. Would not recommend this product!
1.0,The description said it would fit a big head and gave a measurement and it turned out to be smaller than described. I cut it and modified it so I am using it but big headed people should measure your head and contact the seller before ordering. Great quality hat just a little too small for me.
1.0,This strap is too short for any type of guitar. It is for ukuleles or any similar small string instrument.
1.0,"They look dumb when wearing, because the patterns not stamped on both sides, looks awful"
1.0,"This hat was a deep disappointment. It was a joke. It looks nice on the picture but it's impossible to wear since it doesn't even fit my head and probably nobody else. Stop selling your junk. It creates work for you and for the buyer who has to return it.<br />When I was in Vietnam I bought one cheap Vietnamese hat and it was heaven, the best hat ever. I wish I've bought 100 of those Vietnamese hats back then or even make business out of those hats."
1.0,"Barely hold 3 cards. Cool idea, but execution is not there. Returned day I got it"
1.0,Seriously pissed. One earring - who the hell does that.
1.0,Great jacket EXCEPT it is not waterproof. Bought it for trip to Netherlands. Got caught in a shower and shirt was soaked. Wife had more expensive rain jacket and her shirt was dry
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Horribly cheap and was missing pieces. No belt came with my order.
1.0,The design on this is super awkward.  I am still trying to get used walking in them.  I was trying to get a replacement for my old shape ups. These don't even come close.  The look like the bottom of a rocking chair and standing in them is very awkward.  If you are looking for a replacement of the shape ups then this is not it. If you want a rocking chair on the bottom of your feet this is the shoe for you.
1.0,Ordered an XL as a gift. Glad I opened it up. Looked like a M and the iron on was slick and cheap. Sent it back.
1.0,"This shirt was delivered today and I opened the packaging. The shirt stinks of cigarette smoke, to the degree I will likely need to return it. Very disappointing."
1.0,"Was not what I expected. I like my drivers license to be seen and set apart and this wallet does not have a specific pocket for that. Plus, it is smaller than I like and not enough credit card pockets."
1.0,This product isn't soft and cozy like you want a sweat shirt to he and the sizing isn't accurate at all. I wear a 2x and that's what I ordered. It looks like a size medium. Very disappointing.
1.0,I will NEVER order from this company again. The clothing is of poor quality and the print looks distorted. Looks and feels cheap. Nothing but problems with return/refund.
1.0,Those were not for boys! They were for girls and I did not buy that kind.
1.0,"The print was so small, it was pictured big on Amazon,  It was pictured from one end of the t-shirt to the other end. When I received it, it wasn't like the Amazon picture."
1.0,I had high hopes but it was desperately too small. I have a small but and couldn't get it over my chest. I felt like I might not be able to take it off if I did get it to my waist.
1.0,"what i receive doesn`t look nothing like the picture. They were very tiny no rhinestones, more for a little girl then for a woman.to wear"
1.0,"It wouldn't set time or date, it wouldn't stay on."
1.0,Dress looks like it was  the size of a small 12-year old!  Nothing fits! Like the style only
1.0,Cheap material! I know you get what you pay for but this dress looks very cheap in person.
1.0,These pants have 0 linen in them despite the name.
1.0,My husband snapped the jacket up trying it on and when he unsnapped jacket 1/2 the snaps stayed connected to the snaps and tore right out.
1.0,"This dress smelled absolutely horrible. I really almost threw up right after I opened it. It smells dirty. The dress also is not good quality, see through and the print crudely made. I don‚Äôt know how something like this could be sold. It arrived in a zip lock bag. Which is really weird for Amazon who usually ships in a box."
1.0,The bar is too short and on too much of a curve.
1.0,NEED TO RETURN THIS ITEM PLEASE -NOT SATISFIED WITH IT.  PLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH THE RETURN LABEL ASAP.<br />THANK YOU
1.0,Chain was too short and flimsy
1.0,Es muy peque≈Ña y la calidad del producto no es para nada buena
1.0,"It fits fine but the top rolls down like an inch, not as tight as I thought"
1.0,When I ordered this item it's totally not what I got! It was so big for me. I'm returning it.
1.0,Product quality is horrible. Fabric is so cheap that it was frayed when I received it.
1.0,"It looks like it was made out of plastic, not a good stone"
1.0,"My wrist is 6.5 inches (I measured) and this thing suffocates it. It's about as big as a child wrist, and is a horrible waste of money. Seriously. One size does not fit all. I use the small band for fitbits and this is way smaller than that. So disappointing and a waste of money"
1.0,this dress is very clingy.  like clingy but this is downright cheap looking.  don't
1.0,"The dress is pretty but running small,"
1.0,This looked like my son cut out wings and glued them on. It's horrible
1.0,The pants are too short
1.0,"I bought this already having a beard, bit wanted it for extra winter warmth on the face. The hat part and beard part are separate pieces and the beard part attaches by buttons that cannot stay attached to the hat. It's completely worthless unless you want just the hat. As that works as it should. But if you're buying a beard beanie, you will want the beard part!"
1.0,"My boyfriend is tall, almost 6 ft. He has long arms and this was too small for him. It was perfect for me, I'm 5 2'. If you're looking for something for a tall man, this is not it."
1.0,These are so cheaply made. I'm going too keep them. But would.advise against paying that much for some wood.
1.0,Product is very narrow and long. Had I kept themand washed them they wouldn't have fit. Even if they were the correct size the road gh sewn in tag is the size of a playing card.
1.0,"It's a pretty dress, but if you order a large size it fits like a small !!!!!"
1.0,"Not at all what I expected.  It's child size, has tiny pockets, is way too short and very wimpy feeling!  And not the color I thought I was getting.  I was looking for lime green, but is actually a kelly green."
1.0,"This thing is not working, I follow instruction and did not turn on never turn on I‚Äôm very disappointed because was a gift for my granddaughter, I call to return after a little hat time about some issues finally they are going to give me back all the cost.<br />I‚Äôm going to order other but I‚Äôm very happy with all the reviews ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm afraid to get the same thing."
1.0,Bought this as a gift for a little Warrior fan and her mother called me to let me know that the letters were coming off while she was at school. How EMBARRASSING!! Poor little girl. Here I was thinking I got her an authentic NIKE jersey and it's FAKE AF. DO NOT BUY!!
1.0,I received these and immediately put them on to try out. After only 4 hours of wear there were small holes forming in the toe seam. Not very impressed with the quality and I don't think they would last very long. The socks are also very thin and I could see my nail polish through the socks. I'm a female with size 9 feet (men's size 7) and these socks just fit. I imagine they would be small on most men.
1.0,Shirt is cut like a medium....no where near a xxl. For $8 size up 4 times larger.
1.0,Not as classy as shown in the picture. Buttons were missing. not worth the money.
1.0,"I don't often write a bad review, but this product warranted one. Horrible quality, don't waste your money."
1.0,The straps come out of the clasp. I don‚Äôt recommend buying unless you have a hot glue gun or super glue to fix.
1.0,Not 150 and they don't fit in the case st all.
1.0,Too small<br />It's a shame because it's a cute shirt
1.0,Dress is cute and seems to be good material but it runs way too small! I am a 38DD and size 12 and even a XXL was way too tight in the chest area.
1.0,This item is way too small for most children. It should be more for a toddler. It couldn‚Äôt fit my 8 year old and she is smaller than most.
1.0,False advertising!!! These are NOT faux leather.  They are Denim.  They are also NOT low waist as advertised.
1.0,This is for small titts
1.0,its cheap for a reason . the bra ripped apart while I was tightening it. not even that the glue is so cheap quality it din even stick to my skin so I couldn't use it to begin with. Please don get ripped off by buying this product
1.0,"Horrible quality, thin, and they‚Äôre WAY too small. I ordered a large based on reviews and these shirts would maybe fit an 8 yr old little girl. They‚Äôre very poorly made. There is NO shape, when you lay them out they‚Äôre like a square of fabric sewn to another square. Awful. I‚Äôd have given zero stars if I could. I rarely leave bad reviews, but my daughter and I laughed upon opening these, as if someone had played a joke on us."
1.0,These thing run super small! Really nice jacket but you need to buy 2 sizes bigger then what you need.
1.0,Not sure if I got a opened item or not.
1.0,What üòïin the world guarantee they bought from the store now to Selling it  on on Amazon
1.0,Received this mask damaged & no returning it either. Just wanted a replacement
1.0,It hurts in my wrist..cheap quality rubber
1.0,"support hose impossible to put on legs... my fault,, should have known beteeer from experience.."
1.0,"You get what you pay for , not nearly as pretty as pictured, flower appears off white and is in fact yellow"
1.0,defective product. would not buy again
1.0,Opened the package and noticed the stain.
1.0,"I don't think a 5 year old could fit into this. The model has to be wearing a XL. On top of that, the material feels cheap. This one went right back."
1.0,Looks nothing like what I expected....
1.0,"I'm very disappointed in these Amazon Brand - find. Women's Lace Open Toe Sandals, which have a cute color and I was hoping they would fit. when I received them, I saw that the vinyl/plastic material on top of one of the shoes had scratched off with a white patch, that makes them look damaged and unwearable. Even if the patch had not been there tho, I can't wear them because my feet just float in these, with the band being very wide for me, so that unless I was wearing thick socks, these would not stay on. I'm basically dragging these around when I walk. I do not recommend these at all."
1.0,"the chest area looking saggy, like a deflated balloon. also the color was more of ashy green than the pic. and belt was not attached at all and seemed abnormally long. not sure if its supposed to be wrapped around multiple times"
1.0,Great length. Feels great. I expected them to be  thicker than what they are.
1.0,Sizing is not as listed. I could not even get the socks on my feet.
1.0,Medium run too small it tight
1.0,"This is a terrible product. Very cheap. The personalization is just stick on letters. The other decorations are clearly just glued on and there are glue strands hanging from every part of the stocking. I got a beautiful personalized one last year from another website that no longer sells them. This was the closest replica I could find, but it is so tacky."
1.0,Very bulky....gloves inside coming out when you pull yr hand ...waste of money
1.0,2 days wearing them and the stiches are already coming apart. I will not be ordering them again.
1.0,Color is off looks more fusia than pink! I would not buy again from them!
1.0,"Since reading other reviews I ordered 2 sizes larger than normal. That still did not help the fit. Overall it was a strange fit, the sleeves & chest being too snug yet around the belly area it was baggy. I should‚Äôve taken a photo to show how strange it looked. It certainly wasn‚Äôt comfortable nor fashionable! For size reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 170lbs, 38C & still carrying  some pregnancy weight around my middle. For tops from Target & H&M I wear a L or XL. My thoughts are you should pass on this. Really wanted to add these cute stripe shirts to my summer wardrobe, guess I‚Äôll be looking elsewhere."
1.0,Item was broken in small pieces not worth returning the item. Asked for refund. The initial fell off in box. Not worth it.  Sorry. Disappointed.
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt like this shirt at all! The knot in the front was very unflattering, the sleeves were was big! Not what I was expecting at all. Returned it with no hassles."
1.0,Does not look like pic. I wanted tie dye blue and pink and received all pink ones. Also they are different sizes one is smaller than the other and less furry. Horrible quality
1.0,Wrong gloves/different design gloves received.
1.0,came tear up
1.0,bought in september.already falling apart.stiching coming undone. inserts are thin and flimsy would not buy or recommend.
1.0,"Completely false advertising! This ‚Äúblazer‚Äù looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture. It‚Äôs extremely thin/cheap material and has so many lose threads. The material is completely different then advertised, it‚Äôs a shiny thin material. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! üëéüèΩ"
1.0,This dress is see-through
1.0,This blouse was not as advertised. It was not a polyester +cotton fabric. The pattern was not delicate and faded as per the photograph but vibrant and somewhat garish. A disappointment
1.0,They were way too small. The size does not match the stated size at all.
1.0,They sent the wrong mask then acted like they were waiting for ‚Äúverification‚Äù to send me the right one. I had to file a claim and get my money back when I just wanted the mask
1.0,Had to return . Runs way too small
1.0,"Neck is weird, looks wrinkled all time.Pockets too small"
1.0,This is NOT GOLD COLORED.  You have now sent 2 coats that are TAN and black. NoT what is pictured. So the best way to tell you would be YELLOW GOLD not TAN caramel colored.
1.0,"It broke the first time my daughter wore it and the beads went everywhere, so we couldn't find them all."
1.0,"Not sure how they're taking measurements but this shirt barely got over my head.  It's listed as 3X , I've gained weight shirt is way off"
1.0,"Shirt in picture at all what was sent, not even close. Some polyester tunic mess was sent."
1.0,"Love these. I wear them everyday under my work pants. My legs no longer hurt after standing all day.<br /><br />Update: Bought another pair and they are made different than the first pair. Literally went to the 1st pair and hit &#34;buy again&#34; so i know it wasnt a mistake on my part. The 2nd pair is way tighter than the first pair and doesn't have the breathable mess area either. The 2nd pair is longer and tighter at the ankle. Wish I had known it was a different set before I ordered them. The 2nd set was 3 dollars more than the first too, but I liked them so much I was fine to pay it.<br />You can see from the photo that they are totally different sleeves, but listed under the same name."
1.0,Runs extremely small and I ordered the next size up. Will return it. Very disappointed after waiting so long to receive it.
1.0,Shoes were too big@ the front sole came apart in 1 week.
1.0,"We ordered these for my 3 month old, since they said they were for older kids I expected these to be a little big on him. When they arrived we tried them on and he looked like he was squishing his cheeks together. They are so tight even adjusting them as large as you can they were still squishing my poor baby. He‚Äôs 6 months now and he won‚Äôt be able to wear them, they are too tight. They fit on my head and my 12 year old brother just fine but again feel like your brain is being squished. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again and wouldn‚Äôt recommend. It‚Äôs still pretty noisy and it‚Äôll give you a headache, also if anything touches the outside of the earmuff it amplifies that sound into your ear. Like if they were to scratch or tap it with a fingernail you‚Äôd want to rip them off of your head. Just not worth the attempt or the money."
1.0,Bought for a friend. She loves it!  Friend did love it but now over a year  and 1/2 old and it does not keep time well at all and the strap broke. Would not recommend buying at all.
1.0,"Sent me two different sizes üòí Also, they are heavy in the front causing them to easily fall out unless you put a rubber backing. Pretty bummed these were not as expected but cheap cost so not going through the hassle of returning"
1.0,Wore once and it broke!
1.0,Never received the product do not buy!!! Took two month to not even receive them
1.0,Frame is what I was looking for but lenses are horrible - only good for very short periods and looking straight ahead - the lenses are so badly made there is a lot distortion if you look through the lower half ‚òπÔ∏è
1.0,Ripoff. 50 masks should be $4.
1.0,"Sheer material makes a bra a necessity, but the tight, non-elastic top and spaghetti straps make wearing one impossible.  I returned this product immediately after trying it on."
1.0,"cheap quality , for  $20."
1.0,"Don't like it.  Cheap looking, not well made."
1.0,"Not at all happy with these, better suited for a child. I am sending them back"
1.0,"Light weight , cheaply made<br />Not good for ny weather<br />Not quilted<br />Falsely advertised<br />For $50 not worth the money<br />Disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è"
1.0,"Bought the ring for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas, she absolutely loved it!  Ultra thin lower band broke apart within 2 months, sadly outside of the very short return window."
1.0,"Watch comes super small. Ordered it as a gift for my dad and its nice but like everyone says, the band is too small and your not able to add a link"
1.0,This is not stainless steel! It turned my son's finger green! Very unhappy!
1.0,Item broke the first time it was used.
1.0,The material felt weird against my skin....sleeves for oddly.<br /><br />I had a previous top of this brand that felt and for just right.
1.0,Dress arrived WITH SOMEBODY'S CRUMBLY DEODORANT STREAKS IN IT!!  See photos. Totally nasty.
1.0,I ordered a small and it is enormous. Not sure if I got the right size as there is no label
1.0,Too small and too short sizing was wrong
1.0,Looks like tire treads.  Not even braided. Do not buy.
1.0,The image wasn‚Äôt that bold in color and the blue and red looked faded
1.0,Runs very small. Nice style and fabric but OMG so small.
1.0,Terrible! Material is weird and shiny. Print does not match what is pictured. And it ripped after washing once after I only wore it around the house. Not worth the hassle to return.
1.0,It broke only after a few hours of wearing. I threw it in the garbage. Not worth it.
1.0,"After 2 charges, my 5 year old was so disappointed when her shoes didn‚Äôt charge anymore. Poor wiring."
1.0,Was cute but was ripped right at zipper immediately sent it back
1.0,"I wish I had read the review more carefully. I am so disappointed. These are very pretty, but I could barely insert them. I then discovered that the thick wire was so painful that I had to take them off within an hour. And now they can't be returned. Waste of money, sadly."
1.0,I know these are not expensive but I was hoping the quality would be better. They oxidized within a month which is so sad.
1.0,"Bought this watch band and literally wore it 3 times and not even for 3 full days. On the third time wearing it the watch fell off, not happy about that either. Buyers be were of the cheap construction of this watch band, so disappointed!"
1.0,"Worst product ever! Bought 2, so that I could give one to my daughter. Poorly made, 1 didn't even work at all, the 2nd broke after being in my purse for 3 days."
1.0,It wasn't as I expected
1.0,Straight from China. It's worse than costume quality. The color is awful. White stitching????  Rip would take the person who came up with this jacket straight to the train station!
1.0,The rubber covers over the clips popped off the first time I went to put them on and fell under the seat of the car! They also don't stay up and creep down. Garbage - but what do you expect for that price I guess.
1.0,This was so small and I ordered an xl. Usually they are big on me. It also the shoulder where it was sewn had a hole in it. Not worth it.
1.0,I ordered a XL looks like a small can‚Äôt wear it
1.0,Cheap dress. The zipper is total crap!
1.0,I found small hole in the butt area of these after one wear and one wash.  I was very disappointed because they are very soft and comfortable like lularoe and I had thought I had found a supplier that I could find solid leggings from.
1.0,These are not embroidered! It‚Äôs just printed fabric.
1.0,"Ordered XL for myself, but it fits my daughter (M) perfectly."
1.0,"I am really into oversized, chunky sweaters right now. However, this didn't quite fit the bill - this just looked as though I bought a sweater that was 4 sizes too large, as opposed to looking intentionally oversized and cozy. Additionally, the red is not as pictured - it appears much darker, and I was hoping for a more Christmas-y red color. Unfortunately, I ended up returning it."
1.0,"Came in pack,of two. One never worked. Really not very bright and not easy to attach!"
1.0,Not worth it! The plastic does not hold the diamond.
1.0,How am I supposed to wear this? It won't bend and there's nothing to clip on.
1.0,Don't like look cheap
1.0,"Lasted 2 days, it changed colors and , shriveled"
1.0,The band is cute but kept popping off my fit bit and eventually broke my fit bit because it kept<br />Popping off so now no bands attach to it
1.0,heel adjustable strap to big
1.0,The pockets are not attached to the bag contrary to what‚Äôs advertised!
1.0,"Does not seal across the bridge of the nose, no matter how the ear loops are adjusted.  On the exhale, your breath blows straight up into your eyes.  Forget about keeping glasses clear of fog.  100% complete waste of money."
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt expect a lot for this price, but this product reached a new low. All three compasses gave different readings. Impossible to get off once you have on."
1.0,Way too small and very long legs.  I am not a person who returns things so I gave them away.
1.0,This sweater is bizzare horrible. The sleeves are extremely long and I‚Äôm of average height. So disappointing
1.0,Literally used it for a few hours before it completely stopped working. Don't get it!
1.0,You get what you pay for with this set. I didn‚Äôt like the low quality material and returned.
1.0,"I am so confused by this product. It is sold as a woman's hoodie, but the name is ""kidsform."" What I got was absolutely sized for a child, so I sent it back."
1.0,Too small and quality does not look good.
1.0,Way larger than 18 women's. No way was this going to fit!
1.0,This is poor quality and ill fitting. The material and style is not as pictured and the seller is making me pay return shipping. Amazon should not allow items of this poor of quality to be sold on their site.
1.0,I was really disappointed the earrings broke the backing on the earring
1.0,Soooo small!!! Not made of girls with big boobs at all the large fits like a extra small ..I always order off amazon and this was just horrible ..the color is super cute but made for little boobs for sure
1.0,Item discription should tell you how thin this is. A t shirt is thicker.  Buyer beware
1.0,I ordered black small capri's in hopes of finding a strong thick fabric. This was NOT even close!  So thin and see through!  Not squat proof or good for any public wear.
1.0,"It's no where near to what it looks in the pic. Sub-standard, returned it back."
1.0,"Meh. Don‚Äôt have backings, cheap, turn different colors. But what else puke you expect for the price?"
1.0,mala calida pares un mantel de cosina
1.0,Pants run real small and no room for men's junk!!!
1.0,When I received the package there were no beads in it. I contacted Amazon and they were awesome as usual. They were not able to replace them but the credited my account and told me what I needed to do to get them and also gave me a gift card. However I emailed Bling Jewelry first because I wasn't sure what to do and I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM!!
1.0,Writing too small
1.0,Crooked and off center printing.
1.0,"I ordered a size up, and it was 3 sizes still too small. Very cheaply made, but it is pretty. If you want to wear it once, go for it."
1.0,"Too big for me, look cheap"
1.0,Different thing
1.0,"Very, disappointed. Cheap, broken garbage."
1.0,"Unusable. First time my daughter wore them, she pulled the lining out when she took her hands out.  Now it's impossible to get the lining back into the shell. Extremely poor design. I will be returning them."
1.0,i never rec'd the one i ordered but my friend got hers and it was a piece of garbage. cheaply made and did not work
1.0,The band material and clasp are decent quality but the clip that attaches and holds to watch on both sides of band are defective won't lock in and stay attached to watch.
1.0,Very pretty but turns your ear green
1.0,Very cheap looking. By far the worst thing I've ever gotten on Amazon. HORRIBLE!!
1.0,"Inside pocket zipper doesn't work. After using for a few weeks, the inside liner that holds the handles started ripping out."
1.0,"This dress is really cute in concept, nice color, but sticks to all the small curves and bumps on the body, not at all flattering due to material"
1.0,The size was too big!
1.0,"I liked that is 100% cotton, but I doesn‚Äôt like that is toooo big for kids 5 years old, it‚Äôs like for fat kids or something like that they need to improve the size a little bit putting more slim. Thanks,"
1.0,returned bc they fit funny
1.0,"Very ill fitting! The sleeves are way short. It fits very small. You have to pay for shipping both ways. Very frustrating. Do not waste your time on this. It looks like it should be really nice online and especially with the expensive price, but no worth it!!!!"
1.0,"Buy 2 sizes larger than you would normally wear if you intend to launder it @ any time. All of my laundry, except towels, is done on warm wash/cold water rinse & low/perm. press heat. I had it in the dryer for 20 mins., then hung it up to finish drying.  This thing shrank @ least 2 sizes. Garbage. I got one wear out of it!"
1.0,They were a little big on my son.
1.0,"I've had this shirt for less than a week, washed it once, and the lettering and logo is already fading off. Poor quality product."
1.0,Shrunk at least 2&#34;  in the length.
1.0,cheap thin plastic. Will break right away. Buy a better one. not worth it
1.0,"I bought the skeleton with the intention of putting it inside a coffin for decoration. Sure it says 33 inches, but its really not wide at all, looks like a baby's skeleton, which is what I absolutely didn't want."
1.0,Gold was very shiny and made the glasses look cheaper than they already were.
1.0,"seams, stitches, hems, inside out, incomplete<br />so disappointed"
1.0,"Cute but flimsy, and cannot adjust sizing. I got this for my 13 year old son, and it was big on him. Anyway, he was playing with his younger brother and it broke."
1.0,Junk. Lenses don't even fit proper
1.0,"Ordered this for my gf for Christmas. Super excited, but I received 2 bottoms and no top. I order a size up and they still look too small. There's no tag stating the size of the bottoms so I'm pretty sure I didn't get what I ordered, at all."
1.0,"The gel is thick enough to do the job, but I can't understand how to to put it properly in place and have it stay on  stay on. The company needs to provide  thorough instructions that are foolproof. Please help or or refund my purchase."
1.0,Fell apart and didn't hold up and itchy
1.0,"Super unflattering, fits like a weird canvas bag."
1.0,"Purchased this as a replacement for the original rubber band, after a friend got one.  Looked nice, was decently easy to resize with the tool provided.  Never quite attached to the watch right from day 1.  Inconsistently clipped into place, always felt like it would come apart.  Put it on yesterday and it did actually fall apart.  The screws holding the attachment clip stripped out and it sent several pieces flying into carpet.  Very disappointed."
1.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and 130 lbs. Looks good on the model.... did not look flattering on me. The slit is not present unless you open the dress up.
1.0,Junk see through material.  Returned product.
1.0,Nice colors but too short in length.
1.0,Dress is way bigger than expected and not really a dress... more like a really long tunic. Might be cute with some leggings. I would suggest ordering a size smaller if you want a tighter fit.
1.0,Dropped in the snow and broke.  Cheap
1.0,I loved this set so i ordered a second in a different color.  The shorts were SUPER tight.  Same size but I am so disappointed.
1.0,"I really liked the look of this ring; however, I too would agree with others in that it must not be surgical steel. I've never had problems with my naval piercing until I used this ring. I removed the ring as soon as I noticed the pain. Now, I'm recovering from a bad reaction that turned into a horrible (and not to mention gross) infection and am currently on antibiotics :("
1.0,Uncomfortable thong
1.0,"This is acrylic, not Cotten as the pictures highlight"
1.0,"The pants were made very cheaply! Stitching was already coming apart before I took them out of the package! I ordered them to wear to a Christmas party, and I was so disappointed I would not wear them. In fact, I have not ever wore them out!"
1.0,Stone in the middle was broken off of the ring entirely.
1.0,So disappointed with this company. I had no idea I would be charged 3 quarters of the price of the dress to return it. It was way too big and now I have a dress I will never wear in my closet. I messaged them but they did not resolve my problem.
1.0,"The necklace looks like molded glass, not a natural stone. I regret this purchase"
1.0,Shirt length.....not tunic....not as pictured
1.0,Too long and returned
1.0,Nothing like expected didn't like it.
1.0,"Poorly made, very thin material.. And sizing is about 8 sizes off at least. I am a size 12-14 and ordered a 2XL.. I ENDED UP GIVING IT TO MY FRIENDS 8 year old daughter (who is average size for her age, not big or exceptionally tall) and it fit her just right."
1.0,One of the earrings does not hug and they are already starting to peel. They might want to check the earrings before they send them out.
1.0,"They are NOT soft and they are too tight, since I started using them I got my feet to hurt like never before!  Do you want to hurt your feet, then get them!  If you want something truly confortable get Crocs!  Stop lying saying they are soft and confortable! Shame on you!"
1.0,Very thin and it just doesn‚Äôt sit right on my nose.
1.0,"Did not work after a month and it stopped working a few days after the 30 day return.<br />Please look elsewhere, not happy St all"
1.0,"The swimming suit runs small and if you have a bust larger then a D cup, don‚Äôt bother."
1.0,FAR too small and color off too. Looked like faded purple not gray. Wanted to return it but shipping back to China was too expensive so it went directly to Goodwill. Bummer.
1.0,Too big in the torso but the straps were too small..just dont..
1.0,Dry clean only!! Really??
1.0,The swimsuit was ripped in two places on the mesh!!
1.0,This is to tiny for any child older that 6 months and that‚Äôs stretching it need to advance customers of the actual size. It‚Äôs not to place around the head just a topper on the head. Very disappointed.
1.0,Got the dress‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs dirty.
1.0,Loved it when I seen it wore for a day and it broke üòï
1.0,They dont fit properly
1.0,Paint flaked off all over after one day
1.0,Horrible product. Don‚Äôt waste your $100. Looks decent enough at setup. We used/cranked it open twice. On the third use the rope broke before the umbrella was fully open and is now a waste<br /><br />If the seller reads these please advise on how to contact you for this (I live overseas and cannot ship/return heavy item)
1.0,Very cute and my grandson lived but the shaft started bending after days. We returned.
1.0,"DO NOT IRON! I received these and they fit well. Not sure what material they're made of, but when I touched them with the iron on the lowest setting, they melted. I was trying to iron out the shipping wrinkles...Seriously! I didn't even wear them once!"
1.0,This item runs big and is paper thin. More a nightgown then a dress.
1.0,"The product they sent me did not say ""PIMP"", it was a totally different mouth grill called ""Billy Bob"".  So if what you want is one that says PIMP, don't order this."
1.0,It‚Äôs shrinks I got a large and now it seems like it‚Äôs a xxxsmall !
1.0,My 3.5 year old really likes these shoes. They fit great. But within a few minutes he pulled the little black tab off that tightens the laces. As you can see it's small and could be a choking hazard. I really want to like these shoes. But I think a better design would be safer.
1.0,Product doesn‚Äôt fit well
1.0,"Inhad the xxxl but they were too big. Now, The xxl are too small"
1.0,odd fitting blouse - bottom is tapered while the top is falling off my shoulders and I have wide shoulders. The material is stiff and cheap feeling. Worst top I have ever purchased from Amazon !
1.0,"The product does not fit as expected.  It runs small. The material is thin and you can see through it. Undergarments must be worn underneath such as a slip or shapewear so that your underwear are not shown. It is also very short,  as this fit is well above the knees. I'm 5'11."
1.0,Prefer these style belts. Got this last week Wednesday I think. The pin that holds the buckle hinge fell out and I can‚Äôt find it. Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,Holes in the lining within a week.
1.0,"I loved that there was multiple lengths, but they are definitely not ment for a long period of time, or if you sweat. They turn green and also stain your nose."
1.0,Recieved it and quite a few nots are undone and the face of jesus is terrible:/ debating on returning it but its such a hassle for $5. Wish I could be writing a better review.
1.0,At first I loved these..and was going to buy another pair.  But today I put them on and found a big rip in the crotch!!  This is a first for me..and I will not be buying this brand again.
1.0,"Not Cotton, does not stretch, and is too small."
1.0,"Worst product .. Do not waste your money on it .. it's total plastic .. stones are not even of dark green colour , its very pale n light green ..doesn't go with my dark green dress .. it's opposite to what they showed in pictures"
1.0,"Unfortunately, this is being returned, the fit was really weird, the torso part is super short so its difficult to adjust & doesnt allow for blousing, and doesnt feel like it has the proper proportions. Cute idea, but weird sizing, especially if your over 12 years old."
1.0,Too tight on my son and he is a small in men's and got him the Xtra Large and still tight.
1.0,"I got these as a gift from my mom and was initially psyched about it (since they're heavily hyped on the boston running scene)...until I wore them running. I don't understand what the hype was about. They don't stay put on top of my head if I take them off in shady patch, they fog worse than gas station lenses, and they slide around on my nose. These are $5 sunglasses with $6 worth of ironic packaging and cost $25. I'm so annoyed. Hipsters took my mom's money and I don't want to tell her that her generous and well-meaning gift is useless so I'm going to have to donate them rather than return for a product that actually works. I've been wearing other modestly priced running sunglasses for years (suncloud, optic nerve) and have been perfectly satisfied with the performance to cost ratio. I learned an important lesson: if you need an item to actually perform a function, don't buy it from a hipster. The product engineer responsible for this trash should seriously consider a new line of work."
1.0,Broken strap after 10 months.<br />I just purchased a Crocs Swiftwater sandal that had 4.7 stars rating. It‚Äôs very rugged and comfortable!
1.0,Literally was fine till I opened the package.... The winged heart broach wasn't securely fastened in the back and the pin eventually fell out. The &#34;wings&#34; didn't even have the bendable part inside it and of course no instruction on how to put the wings together. I'm deeply disappointed.
1.0,Too small. Wayyy too small. I don't even think they sent me the right size. Looks like it was made well... Too bad I couldn't try it out
1.0,I bought the set just for the glasses for my kids glow in the dark skating party. Needless to say the glasses wouldnt snap together to connect. Waste of money
1.0,"I‚Äôve worn some of the bigger brand names. They stay put when doing various activities. While these are comfortable, they are constantly riding up. I have more problems with having to pull them down. If you want cheap, get this. If you want quality, pay more."
1.0,Disappointing ! Not a true mitten but more of an oven mitt.
1.0,Beautiful dress. Zipper was broken straight out of the bag.
1.0,Not what I was expecting at all would not buy again!
1.0,"I've been eyeing this piece for a long time and was super disappointed to find that it looked damn near frightening when I tried it on. Because I'm 5'3"" and have a small torso it was wayyyy to loose in the back and about 5 inches too long for me. I'm 129lbs, 34B, 26"" waist, with 38""hips if that helps anyone else.<br /><br />The yellow is actually more of an orange.. like a prescription pill bottle orange, which is not at all what I was expecting. I also find the seller's photos to be completely misleading, as the material is so thin and cheap looking that it could be mistaken for an actual fishing net. If you plan to use this piece to catch your next dinner, I highly recommend purchasing it, otherwise the only thing you may be catching in this bodysuit are sideways glances and genuine looks of concern. Not even the least bit flattering, but I did receive a full refund upon return."
1.0,"pretty cheap, can't use it for what I intended."
1.0,"It broke after 5 days of wearing it, worse purchase even. It looked good but in terms of durabiloty that's a don't."
1.0,Worn the glove for less than a week now and it's already falling apart. The gloves are warm and I liked them but the quality isn't there
1.0,The material is cheap and I bought a size up and was still to tight
1.0,returned... way too small
1.0,It started to falls apart after 4 washes at the seams. Go to actual store instead.
1.0,"Odd cut.  Odd fabric.  Odd fit.  And WAY too small - it's skintight now.  Can't imagine what it will be like after washing.<br /> Even with the substantial discount I got from a Facebook group, it wasn't worth it to me.  If I'd paid the price showing on the item listing, I'd be livid."
1.0,These are cute and seem sturdy. They are small. It didn‚Äôt give a size option and of coarse it didn‚Äôt cross my mind till it was too late. Update: this watch band burnt my skin where the medal clasp sits. Off to the garage.
1.0,"These were not at all comfortable because they have a weird cut. The waist has plenty of room but the thigh/butt area is way to small. I'm not particularly gifted in that region, so to say that was unexpected is an understatement. I ended up just getting rid of them."
1.0,Not for cartilage earrings!!!
1.0,very beautiful sandal first time my daughter love them cried every time she put them on size too small if you purchase purchase a size bigger they're a little stiff
1.0,Horrible material don't buy
1.0,I really wanted to like this umbrella. It SEEMED sturdy and like a great umbrella for the price but it‚Äôs got a few problems. First the velcro strap that you should be able to wrap around to close it up is too short. There‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre getting that sucker velcroed again after the umbrella has been opened. Second it broke after about two or three uses so one of the ribs already is limp when the umbrella is open and often gets stuck when trying to close the umbrella. Third this is NOT a travel umbrella. Very heavy and large.
1.0,Extremely small. Got a XL and it probably wouldn‚Äôt fit my Medium sized sister
1.0,"I ordered a small and they are huge on me. I really like the style tho, just wished they offered a extra small"
1.0,This looks nothing like the quality in the picture. The rainbow colored portion on the top and shorts is a mesh like extremely sheer material. I'm afraid to try it on as it'll probably tear up and I need to return. Definitely overpriced. See photos.
1.0,Two in a row with a dead battery
1.0,Small band suitable for a small man or a woman. The Roman Numeral for the number 4 is wrong. Apparently there is a different Roman numeral in China. Look at the photo for 4 o'clock
1.0,It came ripped in several places and very cheap material.
1.0,Not pleased. Cannot get the band to snap in place
1.0,"It looks Too small for my 3 year old, and it looks really cheap..."
1.0,"This shirt is made from polyester, advertised as cotton."
1.0,If you are looking for a product that will hug your body nicely for a tone look then get this in a size smaller than your regular but if you want baggy and unsatisfying then get your regular size. The hood is very rhing and annoyingly flaps around like a dead weight and is more for looks than utility
1.0,Terrible item I cannot make it look good or make it anything like picture shown I waited one day too late to return. Item hangs weird and has very puffy sleeves
1.0,Broke as soon as I put them on
1.0,"Stones were practically black. Return was easy, though!"
1.0,Cheap don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,This looked like a piece of cut fabric sewn together.
1.0,"Very cheap feeling and the glass that is used is beyond fragile, mine cracked during the first week, wish a plexiglass material would've been used"
1.0,Came ripped feels and looks cheap looks like plastic
1.0,Wore once and came apart.
1.0,The butterfly design is cute. Very thin top but the shirt is cheaply made and flawed. There was no string in the top/chest portion only at the bottom.
1.0,It‚Äôs paper thin
1.0,My sons waist is an 8 but length is a 10. I ordered the 11/12 to be safe. It's all too small. The decal was very cheaply done. I went to return and only got a partial refund because they said not to return it. I haven't recieved the refund yet but they said it could be 15 days.
1.0,This completely broke my wrist out and was extremely painful to wear. I was very unsatisfied and disappointed.
1.0,"I shoved all of my hair into it, but since there's no room for expansion, the whole bundle just slides down the back of my head and the ties remain fixed around my face"
1.0,I ordered a XXL.  I received a robe labeled XXL.  It was sized no larger than a Medium.  Impossibly too small to be a XXL.
1.0,"I ordered the small ring with a thick gauge. I wanted the ring to be snug at my septum, but I can‚Äôt get the ball back on the ring. The ring‚Äôs metal is so thick that it does not give a little to allow the ball to attach. I had to use pliers to release the ball from the ring at first try, but I thought that maybe the metals had been soldered together a little.<br />There‚Äôs no way to contact the seller to inform them of this goof, but I waited too long to send back anyway thinking I‚Äôd maneuver that ball into the ring somehow. It‚Äôs been 5 months‚Ä¶ the photo is the current state. Separated and unusable."
1.0,"I'm a size 4 women's and I got the smallest size- still way too big, particularly in arms. If fabric width in arms were smaller may have looked better? Still awkwardly shaped though."
1.0,"I suppose it is my fault that I tried to buy a necklace for a cheap price and expect it to be nice, but this was just terrible. As I took the product out of the bag the &#34;pearl&#34; fell right out onto the floor and the chain broke. SO CHEAP. Don't buy this product just not worth it. Save a little and get something nicer. If this stayed in-tact long enough it would've been cool for Halloween."
1.0,The material was too thin and the thighs were pretty snug. Waist fit well.
1.0,The gold stars are terrible. They flake off very easily. Wore the dress for less than an hour and I left a trail of gold. I bought it for the stars and they come right off
1.0,I was very excited to get this band for my watch. When I got it I out it on and it was very comfortable. I work as a service technician and I need comfortability. The first say I wore it the band broke right off the pin. I'm highly upset about this as I was under the impression from reviews and specs this would be the perfect band for me
1.0,"You must be kidding. I know binders are tight and uncomfortable by definition, as I have worn several, however this one is just absurd. My measurements put me at the smaller end of this size window (I also considered the size below), but I still couldn't even get it on, trying both pulling it on over my head and stepping into it as some suggested in the comments. I gave up eventually simply out of fear I might never get it off again without scissors. The material is also this ultra-scratchy torture fabric that irritated the heck out of my skin from just the short time I had the misfortune of being in contact with it. I will say this model (vs the underworks ftm gynecomastia ultimate chest binder, which I also tried) did have a softer layer of less torturous fabric lining the front, but not the back. Perhaps the idea was it would be too hot to line the front and the back of the binder, but I found the abrasive material so horrible, constantly poking and scratching my body, that I would most certainly tolerate it being hotter over all that scratchiness. If I could even get the dang thing on that is. This binder was a complete and utter fail."
1.0,"These leggings are way too short for the average western body. They are probably OK if you have short legs, are short in the body and also have very skinny legs. I am normally a U.S size 6 - 8 and ordered a large size. I can't pull them all the way up & they are super tight on my calves - you need twig like legs. The quality is really thin & cheap - I have tights that are thicker and more durable. Another reviewer mentioned they look like garbage bag material -yeah, that's a better description, they have a bit of shine but nothing really leather-like about them. The postives: They are arrived promptly and they were super cheap!  I'll probably donate them to a teenage niece (but they'll probably be too short for her too.) Update! Same problem on my teenage niece- they run too small in the body and although she has skinnier calves they are way too tight in the thighs for her. Only order these if you are short and have very skinny legs."
1.0,2 nicks were on the black metal area and they tried to cover it up by painting it over i realized only because i used my thumb to remove the off color spots
1.0,Nice material fits everywhere but the length is soooo short. Looks NOTHING like the picture.
1.0,"This dress is made out of the same fabric as cheap halloween costumes, so that‚Äôs what it looks like on. not flattering or cute. nor does it look like the dress in the picture. i knew i was going to return it as soon as i opened the box."
1.0,The fake leather that holds the front clasps tore in two in less than a month.
1.0,Way too small .
1.0,Bought in red . The sizes are not true .<br /> A large was way to small and I normally take a med . I hate when companies do not make sizes correct
1.0,"don't waist your money on this  cheap Chinese junk, I give this hat to a 10 year old, and the kid din't like it, because was to ugly."
1.0,"These are not men‚Äôs sizes, they are extremely small!! I do Not recommend!"
1.0,Followed the size chart but way too small.  Returned
1.0,Product is very cheap even for the price. Go to the dollar store and save your money.
1.0,Not for thick girls.
1.0,Zipper will not stay closed.  I cannot use it at all.
1.0,"It looks really clean in the picture, but when I got mine it was rusty and not shaped as nicely as the one in the picture. Also, when I tried to adjust it, it just went back to how it was and slipped off my toe because it is too big."
1.0,Showed up scratched
1.0,Loved the style of the show! Bummed the bottom of the shoe in the front came apart with in the first week of wearing them!
1.0,Not tight enough across bridge and not the correct style...similar....but not lime picture shown
1.0,"I never had a strap break on a nightgown the first time I wore it as this one did.  In fact, I have never had a strap break on any nightgown until this purchase."
1.0,No pleased at all with the quality of the bracelet.. the bracelet is very thin and has some rough edges.. I have purchased other bracelets within same price range that were of better quality..
1.0,Went dark and smells weird after a couple weeks
1.0,Order 1 sizes up and the shorts are shorter then the picture
1.0,The band I received didn't match the picture.  I gave it away.
1.0,After one wash the flower faded
1.0,This watch is really nice looking but doesn't keep time. All it did was frustrate my son whom couldn't get it to keep the time.
1.0,The dress had rips on it up on arrival
1.0,"Because it is advertised as  &#34;Loose Fitting&#34; I did not see a problem. However, it didn't fit at all. The top was so tight I couldn't wear it. I bought an XXL thinking that it would probably shrink slightly when washed. This fit more like a Medium. When I looked at the size chart, the sizing was clearly non standard.<br /><br />Unless you are really petite, you should avoid this product. If you are petite, I suggest Large or XL."
1.0,"As I said the quality of the stitching is sub par and it ripped where the ties attach the first time I tied it, fixed it myself but still it‚Äôs low quality"
1.0,Really bad product
1.0,First of all they are advertising ANOTHER product in the reviews..this product was wayyyy to flipping small..I'm at 16/18 more towards 16..I ordered a 4x which should've been to big but the reviews said go a size up so I went 2 sizes up..no ma'am it didn't go anywhere near around my body..I'm so upset..now I'm realizing the pics in the reviews are for ANOTHER WAIST TRAINER NOT THIS ONE!!!!!
1.0,"Horrible quality. They didn‚Äôt even last a full month. The strap came apart, some of the cloth came apart and the entire left side rear piece came out of the base. For reference my sons‚Äô last shoes lasted over six months."
1.0,They did not fit my fingers.
1.0,I thought they were blue üòë
1.0,No clue how this fits.<br />I started to take it out of the package and glitter went everwhere. Material was thick. It was a mess. I returned it
1.0,I will not purchase again. Advertised as &#34;Premium Deluxe&#34; They fell apart after the first time I washed them.
1.0,The swoosh is a sticker that came off after the first use. Cheap!!
1.0,Has a funky smell on it that doesn‚Äôt go away
1.0,It broke in the first used and it got lost.
1.0,"I bought an XL and it fits like a small, there's no stretch at all!"
1.0,This product is so cheap the material is so cheap it looks like a $10 vest DO NOT BUY
1.0,When it arrived I was very happy I wore it to a old school birthday party and it was amazing!! But the the next weekend I wore it again to dinner and it began to change color... It didn't get wet or exposed to sweat.. do not recommend if looking for long term wear.
1.0,Wasn't the same dress that was represented in the photo
1.0,I have never had a problem with belly rings being too short but the bar on this one is too short to put the bead on; basically the gems are pretty but it is un-wearable.
1.0,I don't know who a large was meant for. This &#34;large&#34; couldn't even get on one leg. I'm a size 10/12 and I think this was a large for an 8 year old not a grown woman. Do not buy. One star for arriving on time.
1.0,This as received not as nice and  fish line can‚Äôt be unroll not what it looks like!!
1.0,"very over-priced at $39.99.  With all things considered, $20~$25 would be about right."
1.0,Size???
1.0,The colors didn't match each other!!  I ordered 1 pair black & 1 pair gray.  I received 4 different colors of black & grays.  They don't match.  They're not wearable.
1.0,"Cheap material, even cheaper decal!"
1.0,"Ordered it for a vacation, broke first day I used it. The strap fell apart where it connects to the bag. Had to stich it by hand to last me the rest of the week."
1.0,"So UGLY! It looks orange and cheap. I would pass, if I were you."
1.0,"In the picture seems nice, but in reality is different. For sure is another cross in this picture. Don't buy from this guy."
1.0,Cheap and way too big. Returned
1.0,"I have had 20% coupon codes that calculated 10% off.  I have paid extra for 2 day shipping only to find out from USPS it was sent regular mail.  When the items actually arrived, they sent less than I ordered but conveniently put it on the packing list.  If you call for help, you get a machine that has no room for messages, and if you email support, be prepared for the next ice age to get a response as I have NEVER gotten one with many tries.  And if you use the company's store front, multiple the hassle by 10.  I NEVER write reviews of virtually anything, closest is leaving feedback on Ebay, but only positive.  This complete disconnect from the merchant and buyer cannot be duplicated.  I will call my bank's claims/fraud department if I do not get the missing item overnighted since I paid for 2 day and got regular mail.  But the odds of the email ever being read are 1000 to 1.  Will update how many attempts to contact this company until a planned trip to their mailing location and I will personally pay a visit with my merchandise."
1.0,Extremely embarrassing. It was a Christmas gift and falling apart.
1.0,"its like five sizes more of me, I didn't use it"
1.0,the pocket is crocheted lace...not what I was expecting
1.0,After the first wash the waist band elastic twisted inside casing. Unable to fix. 1 star for being cute but not a good product
1.0,"Would give zero stars if possible, completely ruined after first wash, shame because it was very good looking when it was new. But after a single wash looks like it's a few years old, color totally faded"
1.0,"I ordered an XL which typically fits a bit loose from other retailers, buyer beware this ships from China and is probably a US size medium and i cannot return it because the shipping costs more than the shirt did."
1.0,"I cannot believe anybody has ever given more than 1 star for this garbage (see below). Here's how bad it was...I notified Walleva I wanted to return my order because I wasn't happy w/ the fit of temple pads - 2 sizes , both cheap plastic, neither fit. For what it's worth, the ear socks were cheap plastic , too large as well. Anyway, when I notified them I would be returning  them they e-mailed me back-  they didn't want them either.<br />What that really means is that the cost to make these is less than what it would cost them for return shipping.<br />I literally through them out."
1.0,This ring turned my hand green after wearing it for 6 hours! I didn't even get it wet! Total waste of money.
1.0,"This product is advertised as hematite. As you can see in the photo I‚Äôve shared, it is in fact magnetite. The photo is showing it sticking to my refrigerator. While magnetite has its own beneficial properties, I have an issue with it being advertised one thing, when it is something else entirely. I understand that they look very similar. But they are not the same thing."
1.0,comes small
1.0,Where it once and broke
1.0,Tiny hoops - for a child not an adult.  The ad should say that.
1.0,terrible material. it runs big
1.0,"I loved this item when I first got it. I received it on March 2 and used it immediately(after sanitizingof course), and looked amazing! But the green tint started to peel!"
1.0,"This hat‚Äôs brim is wire; so WHY, AMAZON PACKER, would you bend it in half for shipping?  Useless and being sent back, which is a shame because it‚Äôs super cute."
1.0,the product never came into my hands loo qualify neutral
1.0,THERE OK FOR 20 DOLLARS
1.0,Nunca me llegaron.
1.0,The product was much shorter than in the picture and a totally different shade of pink. It was bubble gum pink. Very disappointed.
1.0,My son wore this for less than an hour before the nose piece broke. Not worth the money.
1.0,"The waist is good, but the hips are twice as big as waist is, so please be careful of people selection, for they are paying  you to receive not perfect product, but at least acceptable product."
1.0,Received a defective pair had to return
1.0,I bought this umbrella because it had recieved good reviews.  The first time I used it there was no wind or heavy rain. I pushed the button an it opened smoothly with the exception that the outer edges turned in the opposite direction. Once it opened I saw that it was not as wide as it was shown in the pictures and I ended up wet from my waist down.  So I give the review after I have used the umbrella more than once. This umbrella is not worth the price it is selling for.
1.0,I wore this less than a few hours (just around my house) and it broke.
1.0,"Very disappointed! Very cheaply made! I have purchased corsets in the past. that were the same description as this one and there were heavy duty, sturdy this thing I feel like it's going to fall apart as soon as I put it on not happy with this at all."
1.0,Hot super hot fabric doesn‚Äôt really breathe.
1.0,"Unfortunately, Very bulky. Returned"
1.0,they advertise they come with rubber stoppers around the eye sockets but they dont.
1.0,cheap bag not worth the price even on sale
1.0,Poorly designed. They have a thick piece of elastic in the waist band and after a month it gets twisted up uncomfortably inside the fabric And looks lumpy and cannot straighten it. This happened on three different pairs of shorts I bought from this company.. Additionally these shorts end up stretching out and look kind of loose and wide around the legs making your legs look smaller. These are supposed to be bodybuilding shorts that‚Äôs not what we want. Very disappointed I will not be buying products from this company again.
1.0,"Super sheer, ordered for my 3yr old and it fit like a shirt. Not long at all :("
1.0,I wouldn‚Äôt give it one star if I didn‚Äôt have to.
1.0,Very cute but 1 month into the school year and the zipper has broken and the pull for zipper constantly comes off.<br />The little bag that comes with for a lunch box is really to small for a lunch. It‚Äôs more for a snack.
1.0,"Unfortunately this necklace was nothing like I thought it would be. The gold looked extremely off the color, the chain was not as described it was 6 in shorter, and broke before I could even put it on my neck."
1.0,Garbage do not buy!!
1.0,It arrived broken.  Horrible quality.
1.0,"the small part of the back of the earring were you connect the two together is rotated the wrong way, so the head is facing forward and the body is facing to the side."
1.0,"The netting doesn't hang down at all and is attached to the hat.  The Bow is already come half off. Over all, a waste of money for me.  I am going to have to buy a different one.  I don't understand all the good reviews."
1.0,"The bands are pretty and comfortable but the craftsmanship is extremely poor where it attaches to your Fitbit. Two bands have disconnected from my watch and the last time I thought I had lost it for good. Fortunately it was still in the sleeve if my sweater. If you value your Fitbit, don't buy these bands."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy, the spring isn‚Äôt strong enough to hold tension on the cord. These are junk."
1.0,Too short and cheap fabric. Every time I move my arms it becomes too short (showing my butt) and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô6‚Äù 140 pounds ordered medium.
1.0,The  thinness.
1.0,Sizing is incorrect. Ordered large. Needed an XL
1.0,The emblem was an iron on and it was crooked.  Waste of money.
1.0,Very large covering most of ear
1.0,This item is junk. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Very pretty but sized about 3 sized too small.
1.0,"No se acoplan a la forma del pie, la parte del encaje es demasiado ancha quedando a la vista"
1.0,"Fabric isn't nice quality and if you have any sort of bust, don't bother."
1.0,Extremely small and doesn't fit anything like pictured.  It was basically a tube top.  Only a good buy for someone really tiny or a child even.
1.0,"Will not stay up, and keep sliding down."
1.0,"This tie clip is adorable but very flimsy. It bent the first time I put it on. The clip itself is a little short and didn't hold my tie very well. I'm a server at a restaurant so I thought it would be cute, wish it was better material."
1.0,"Sizing is off to the small side, Zipper is on the left, suggesting woman's clothing, not men's. This sell it as unisex is BS. I order men's clothing I expect to get men's clothing. Also thinner and more for fashion than warmth in the cold."
1.0,Size is not true to normal. Very sheer material
1.0,They fit me fine they just stick out all weird and get caught on my shirts and things I'm carrying. I wore them for a day and couldn't take it anymore.
1.0,"These were not of decent quality, the way they were stored and shipped they got mashed and unable to correct/fix & I am a crafty person  - were unwearable"
1.0,No wonder this sweater was on sale. If I designed a sweater in total darkness then forced some seamstress to put it together--this is the sweater you'd get.  The wife couldn't believe how poorly designed and akward the styling was.  Save your money.
1.0,"I ordered this from the Arctic Cool website directly.  I was hoping it would be a loose fitting comfortable gaiter that I can use as a face covering while away from home.  This is NOT a comfortable gaiter at all.  I have a very average size neck for a man, but the gaiters I received (gray & blue) were very tight fitting around my neck.  I was hoping the fit would be loose at the bottom of the gaiter to allow for air flow from underneath.  The pictures here on Amazon, and on the company's website make it appear to be loose, but it has elastic at both the top and bottom of the gaiter, so it's tight around the neck.  I had to send both back.  If you want something that is loose, roomy, or allows for ventilation, this is NOT the gaiter for you.  Also, the products are made in China, if you care about such things..."
1.0,"I purchased this for my Grandson. I washed it and the top stayed black, but all the color went out of the pants and they are now grey instead. They are also not fire safe for any child. These are a piece of junk and dangerous and should not be being sold by anyone. They should be pulled off the market!!<br />Do Not Put your child at risk! Do Not Waste your Money!!!"
1.0,Ridiculously long but short in the sleeves. Weird zippers down the sides which dig into the skin. Bad choice.
1.0,"Size was perfect, but expected a more durable material."
1.0,"Didn't work, we all still caught covid"
1.0,One of them was broken.
1.0,Liked the dress... but too small. Advise to order one size up.
1.0,"Runs big, way too big in the chest area. A lot of extra fabric! My chest size is 36C and there was still too much fabric in a medium. Not flattering."
1.0,When we did the dishes it fell on the ground and the clock broke but when I drop 3 of my old watches it all stayed the same.
1.0,This was a nice piece due to the personalization. The buckle simply became unglued from the leather. The seller tried to shaft me by stretching the time of communication but Amazon made it right by me and got me my money back...never again...plus their shipping takes forever!
1.0,I didnt like that some of the silver part of the earring is discolored. When I went to try and return the item it said item not eligible for return. Can I please make an exchange then? It wouldn't be right if I were to be stuck with a purchase that doesn't resemble the picture.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I added photos
1.0,This band cannot be real leather!  It is peeling and looks awful.  It claims to have a one-year warranty but I cannot find any way to put in a claim.
1.0,No se cierra
1.0,"They fell apart in less than a month, very cheaply made."
1.0,The seams are very off. one arm was tighter than the other. To pull across my chest area one side was longer than the other.
1.0,These are not much more than a piece of gauze. Completely worthless if your goal is to keep sweat from running into your eyes. Might work if you used 3 at a time.  Just terrible.
1.0,Ordered a size 12 for my 10 year old daughter and my 7 year old could hardly fit into it. Terribly fit! Returned it and will not order any Guess products online again!
1.0,you get what you pay for its a $ 6.00 dollar shirt
1.0,The earrings arrived glued together.
1.0,"The size I ordered is one size bigger than the one I normally use and still, it was too small."
1.0,Used this for a couple days when I started having the issue of it falling apart.
1.0,"It looked really baggy and the material was see-through.. Also, I know it's a long top, but mine came out looking like a dress!"
1.0,They got holes within the first 20mins of my daughters dance class
1.0,"I didn't expect much for the price, but it was defective when it was shipped.<br />Waste of money."
1.0,"I have a 13&#34; HP Spectre x360, and it did NOT fit in the laptop slot, with an EMPTY suitcase. Idk if it as a manufacturing defect, but the snap buttons strap were so tight (short?) that with ONLY the laptop in the bag, I had to VERY FIRMLY push and hold it back, to zip up the bag. Will be returning this."
1.0,First day wearing the vest the stitching for the zipper unraveled ending in the trash second vest not exactly a 3x vest more like a 2x not happy with the purchase but you get what you payed for you pay cheap you get cheap
1.0,See pic. they're not a even cut
1.0,"I bought a 2XL. My daughter is an XL and it barely fit her. The material is ""very""  thin and its cheaply made; it is more of a Spring or Fall jacket. I don't recommend at all."
1.0,The color is so bad like old But the fabric is not bad. The size run little small.
1.0,This tie fell apart with two weeks and was only worn once.
1.0,"I LOVED the color and the light weight of this suitcase. Unfortunately it lasted only 2 trips. The outside has multiple chunks out of it and the wheels don't work. If you're planning on taking this suitcase on an airline I would NOT recommend it. If you're going to be traveling by CAR, use at your own risk. Disappointed for the price I paid I could have bought something sturdier."
1.0,These bras do not fit right at all.  The cup is too small.
1.0,Cute yet cheaply made
1.0,"I cannot give this any stars.  The color is not even close to what was advertised, way too long and some funky thin cold material.  In my experience I would say be prepared to send em back if you order. Maybe I just received a bad pair. And I was looking forward to wearing them while working out. Now I guess I will just have to drink wine and look for a new pair..  üòíüòÅ"
1.0,Watch was not working when I got it
1.0,I knew it wasn‚Äôt leather and it‚Äôs hard to figure out how to use it. Unable to double up belt as depicted as way too small. Had to return
1.0,"AWFUL!!! FALLS DOWN TO ANLE. PLASTIC SILKY, NOT SILK SILKY. NEVER AGAIN!!"
1.0,"This is 1  pair, if you can call it a pair. They are different sizes... no good."
1.0,"Absolute garbage.<br />Please save your money.<br />Completely unfinished sewing. Single thread, unfinished frayed edges.<br />I wouldn‚Äôt pay 4 dollars for this garbage at goodwill.<br />When will amazon start vetting these garbage suppliers from China.<br /><br />TRASHHHHHHHH"
1.0,It looked like a bag on me. I sent it back
1.0,No stretch. I ordered yellow and was shipped Grey. Not a good buy.
1.0,"It is almost the black cotton plus sized hoodie dress I was looking for. The fabric doesn't feel or look like cotton. Bad sewing, hoodie is crooked."
1.0,Absolutely terrible do not buy. If I could give it 0 stars I would the product was so small you could barely see the picture on the product and you couldn't even make it out what it was terrible do not buy
1.0,"These were small and poor quality.  I gave them to charity instead of as a gift, which I had intended."
1.0,"The watch started making a high pitched noise (different from the other sounds it is supposed to make) and froze when attempting to power it off (the ‚Äúdo you want to power off?‚Äù Screen appeared, but wouldn‚Äôt allow me to select yes or no. I then took a small screwdriver to remove the back and take out the battery, which was the only thing that stopped the sound.<br /><br />During this time, the watch also got so hot to the touch I had to put it down to remove the battery. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WATCH. It is a danger to children. The battery appears to have been attached with an adhesive."
1.0,I  bought this watch with the idea of taking it to my trip but it was Worst cheap quality watch ever . Everything literally came apart as soon as I took it out and it didn't even come with a glass cover when I tried to change the time on it the thing literally just came out ! Like seriously walmart has better and cheaper once .. sadly I wasn't able to return on time. So Im stuck with this ugly thing üòë I wouldn't recomend
1.0,"I bought the 10 mm size but just received it to find out that it is actually 12 mm. This is unfortunately too big, and now I have to return it."
1.0,It's not a shoe very cheap and flimsy couldn't wear wouldn't wear waste of money
1.0,"This is not even close to being supportive. The lace is rough and itchy.  I would not be able to leave the house wearing this, and its an undergarment.  If you are any bigger than a C keep looking. This aint the one!"
1.0,Cheap to me! Thin
1.0,Need to warn customers of foreign products made in China people in China are very small compared to people in the United States their sizes do not compare
1.0,"I've purchased two pairs of these glasses, both broke within 3 days of wearing them. Terrible quality, but there cheap!"
1.0,Product says necklace and bracelet but only received necklace.
1.0,I have bought many of this rap style dress off of Amazon and this one is really weirdly made. I bought the same size as the other dresses I‚Äôve bought but this one is so short I can‚Äôt even wear it or kind of bend over. This is definitely made for someone that would be under 5 foot two
1.0,The watch band is rubber and it fell apart as I was placing it on the watch
1.0,The item arrived with the Vincent Price's head and the skeleton's head broken.  Very disappointing.
1.0,I really didn't care for it. I didn't like the material it's made of and I really didn't care for the blue. But that's just me I gave to my granddaughter and she loves it.
1.0,It arrived rolled up and never recovered. Still crumpled and very floppy over a week later. Tried the hairdryer as suggested but that didn't do a thing. I am very disappointed. I wear a hat like this all day every day (apart from the rain that is). This has such poor shape and stamina that is is not wearable. Very sad. Would give NO STAR if possible.
1.0,Fabric was shiny like a swimsuit.  I was hoping for non shiny fabric.
1.0,I didn't realize it was coming from overseas. Took a month and I don't think they are true genie. Disappointed

1.0,Buckle snapped off from the spot that it rotates to be reversed after wearing the belt for one day.
1.0,I did not receive the correct color shirt.
1.0,"Doesn't look like the photo, it's all over the place, I took a bigger size than what I normally wear and it didn't fit. Not pleased so I'm returning it."
1.0,Too small and tight. I couldn't<br />even get it on.
1.0,Bad construction in the design the fold inside is not tucked and sewn properly...very cheaply designed.
1.0,not a fit for a sized 16 40 D bust size
1.0,too small had to return
1.0,left at neighbors house.‚Ä¶  they live in Chicago so we knew it was not there package.
1.0,Cheap product. I thought I was buying another msnufacturer
1.0,The dress did not fit true to size. It fit a 12 years old. It was too short. Although the fabric was good but the dress itself did not look like the dress in the picture. Looked cheaply made. I was hesitant to buy since no one reviewed it but I thought ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù. I was not happy so I returned it.
1.0,"Got these for my son who is autistic and has sensory issues, his glasses always bothered his ears this product helped but the biggest issue is they do not stay on. they are always coming off the glasses which is frustrating for him and myself."
1.0,"Terrible material, not exactly as pictured.. and basically impossible to wear because your chest will pop out everytime you even blink<br />Not worth it"
1.0,El traje es bonito. Pero no lo recomiendo- es completamente transparente. El foro q tiene el vestido es bien fino.
1.0,These are the worse slippers I've ever put on my feet even though they were cheap. They say you get what you pay for. Within a few wearings they started turning under my feet like a pair of socks with no life left in them. They went to the trash a couple of weeks ago.
1.0,"It was definitely a cheaper material, not what‚Äôs on the picture.. should be 10$"
1.0,Huge for an xs size
1.0,Las agujas son muy peque√±as para los piercing
1.0,Cheap. Cute at first but later turn your fingers green.
1.0,Imagine my surprise when I went to  put on my new shirt and discovered that the thumb hole was positioned over my LITTLE fingers.<br /><br />BOTH sleeves.<br /><br />This isn't going to work and I am most heartily disappointed at the very shoddy workmanship.
1.0,"I'm not the most svelte human. So, I ordered this a size up. Yet, getting it, it really didn't fit well at all. Not only was it tight across the belly (somewhat my fault), but it didn't really fit in the shoulders either. Remember, I went a size up from what I would normally order. Maybe two sizes? Construction seems decent. However, not much testing done because I just couldn't wear it."
1.0,Unfortunately this came broken and there are no returns.
1.0,These are really cute BUT there is no give in the material. I only have size 7 feet and couldn't get them over my heal.
1.0,Not as described. I chose a white skeleton and received silver
1.0,This is a cheap looking product. The pearls have holes in them that clearly show. Horrible. Don‚Äôt buy.
1.0,Had to re glue feathers back on the wings. Otherwise they were ok
1.0,Too heavy pulling lobes down.
1.0,Got an XL and it is to small for my son.
1.0,"Beautiful umbrella. To open and close the umbrella, the crank worked very well.  Unfortunately, the tilt<br /> mechanism broke on the first day.  The tilt button snapped off.  It was a little windy, but not windy enough  to break a one day old umbrella.  The other patio umbrellas in the vicinity had no problems."
1.0,"Very flimsy material, product is not at all what you see in picture"
1.0,"Feels like cheap poly-cotton blend. Short fibers. Scratchy. I bought three,  I've washed them twice. Definitely not worth $18 when Woman Within is running a half price sale."
1.0,low quality and way smaller that it looks in ine picture
1.0,Went by the size guide. Wear a size 8 and trying to use these in 5 hole sneakers. I ordered a ladies size 2. They are way too short. I was able to do 2 holes comfortably! Very disappointed
1.0,Cute but so so tiny looks you didn‚Äôt wear any jewelry.<br />You have to wear it with some more jewelry!
1.0,"Sizing incredibly ""off"".  Womens XL fit a junior who wears XS/S.  Quality questionable - seams crooked, fabric quality, etc."
1.0,"Terrible quality, broke after one wear"
1.0,I bought this for my niece plus size and it was tooooooo small. My daughter wear size 4 and kept it for her. I think the size measurements are for super slim people. Not plus size. The seller should review USA plus size measurements.
1.0,I ordered an XL and I received a small size coat.
1.0,Broke after 3 weeks...really
1.0,To small doesn‚Äôt fit at all wasn‚Äôt happy with this item
1.0,I have had this belt for almost one year and today it broken on me. I have only used it for color. I thought it would have lasted longer but I was wrong. I will not buy this versatile belt again.
1.0,The ring was so pretty when I first got it but it very quickly turned to copper. I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,"Horrible product!! It‚Äôs not as pictured and when I received the product, it had a horrendous odor. I attempted to get a refund but was only given a partial refund. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,They were soft but could not wear too small
1.0,"This was supposed to be a large, whether they got the tags mixed up I do not know but I could not even get it over my head! I will not be trying to replace it because the manufacture has no idea how to make sizes. I was in the modeling business for 15 years I know my size. These people are nuts"
1.0,"the blooms keeps falling off, after they came i loved it but after a few days the blooms fell off, i sent off to be replaced and the same thing happened with the replacement so i just got my $ back"
1.0,This outfit runs in a small space side. Couldn‚Äôt wear this
1.0,could have been cute but never came.
1.0,"Ordered this item in 2X and recieved a different item all together. Item received, however was actually nicer. It was 2X as odered and It had metal hook closures down front, along with bottoms and  strips of material that fasten across the front between the metal closures. It fit ok but after tightening the laces all the way, it was still a little too large. Thinking that maybe the picture was for this item, I returned it and reordered a 1X. What I got on the reorder was the item pictured and it was way too small. Should have kept first one. At least it fit and was much different that the one pictured and of better quality."
1.0,Would have loved to love it because of the pattern. But way too small for my 6 foot 230 pound husband and fabric is like costume material‚Äînot breathable at all.
1.0,Quality sucks and it‚Äôs not true to size
1.0,cheaply made !  flimsy fabric.
1.0,"The gloves had an acrid chemical smell.  I thought I could wash it off, but when I tried, black dye washed off.  Poor quality."
1.0,Made from the thinnest piece of felt.  It‚Äôs about the thickness of a piece of construction paper and so the brim collapses and it sort of looks like a crumpled bag on the head.  Also there was no crochet spider web on it.
1.0,great sound
1.0,Poor quality not silk
1.0,"Junk!  Practically see through.  Bought for a friend's daughter, but wouldn't use that quality for myself, let alone give it as a gift.<br /><br />On a side note, I purchased the roses (also made by this company) for my own daughter and thought they were wonderful.  Really classy.  They looked like quality.  That's why I took a chance on the birds.  They're not even close to the same quality.  If you like the styles offered, get the roses and save yourself a return shipment."
1.0,"It‚Äôs too small, too thin and doesn‚Äôt hang well. Sorry I ordered it."
1.0,"1 I ORDERED THE SHOE IN THE PICTURES AND I RECEIVED A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SHOE THAT I DIDNT LIKE AS MUCH. ALSO THE REVIEWS THAT I READ STATED THAT THE SHOE RAN BIG, HOWEVER I ORDERED A 6.5 WHICH IS THE SIZE THAT I WEAR AND IT WAS TOO SMALL. HAD TO RETURN THEM AND FIND A SHOE FOR THE PARTY."
1.0,I thought this was like an actual sweatshirt fabric but it‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs wide on the side but kind of short.
1.0,The clasp fell off after a few weeks.
1.0,the pajamas pants have some red spots. that are very noticeable.
1.0,do not buy... this is one of the worst buys I have every made. does not look at all like it does in the picture...
1.0,Not my style of shoe to plain
1.0,Poor quality would not recommend
1.0,I normally wear a size small but decided to go up two sizes after reading the reviews. I am 5‚Äô2 140 pounds and 34DD and the shirt was still tight on my chest after ordering a large. Plus it looked very cheap and the image is screen printed. Not a fan all.
1.0,"This was a pretty necklace until it broke within an hour of me wearing it for the first time. Complete piece of junk. I guess you get what you pay for, but I was expecting something at least mildly decent for the price.  Shipping back promptly."
1.0,There is a gross yellow glue like stain on the shoulder. Wtf.
1.0,Fit good but super thin material. It came with a small hole and I only got to wear it once and the hole spread and became huge!
1.0,The fabric of this dress does not feel or look like linen.  It feels like polyester or something like that. Returned.
1.0,I bought these U.S. polo boxer briefs because I've worn this brand the last couple years. I chose this pack due to the colors available. What I didn't look at is the length of the inseam. How far the leg extends from the crotch. It makes a difference guys. For me shorter is not better. Also my current pair were made in Pakistan the new ones in India. After a couple of washes they have lost their fit.
1.0,"The prong of the buckle was too short, so after you put it through the belt hole it slipped through the buckle frame. Completely useless. The leather was pretty nice. Too bad the manufacturers cheaped out on the prong. Just a few millimeters longer and it would work. See the photo."
1.0,The description is a lie the only way it will fit is possibly if you cut grooves but it's doesn't fit at all.
1.0,the material on this shirt is so cheap and thin... i mean i know it would be cheap material hut not to the point where i could see through the shirt with lights... i would not recommend this shirt for a formal occasion maybe for the clubs hahah
1.0,"Cheap material  very, poorly made.  Feet basically on the ground. Very thin sole unbelieveable for the price."
1.0,"Earrings were horrible.  Looked like someone took a hammer to the metal.  Not shinny, full of dents."
1.0,I thought I bought insulated ones I did not so I hate them
1.0,The charm came off almost immediately. I love the way this bracelet looks but can not wear it anymore since I don't know where the charm is.
1.0,Ordered two different sizes (way bigger than my actual size) and neither fit. Definitely runs very small and not made for someone with a chest. Ended up returning both and not ordering any others
1.0,"I am very disappointed and dissatisfied with this band!  I was getting more steps than usual, so I checked my Fitbit app... I was sitting down and just shaking my wrist, and the app was adding steps with me just sitting!!!  I wanted to put my old original band back on but the little pegs that you can remove the band with we‚Äôre gone!!!!  I tried taking it off and it Won‚Äôt come off!  During trying to take it off, my Fitbit case got gadges in it!!! I want my old band on it so I can wear it!!! I‚Äôm literally crying!!!!  I‚Äôm not rich!!!  Please REPLACE my Fitbit Versa!  If it wasn‚Äôt for this band I bought, it would be in new shape!!! Now it has sharp gadges!!!  I can‚Äôt wear it , it will cut me!!  Please replace it!  Rose gold one!  Thank you!  Ann Chagnon.  ( actual reading is ‚Äú0‚Äù)"
1.0,To get the band to work had to use the original watch pins of the watch. The pins that came with the band wouldn‚Äôt stay. Cheap construction. Would give 0 stars if possible.
1.0,Too small don't like the material
1.0,"This is a cute handbag, but is definitely NOT leather.  There is no leather smell, the embossing on the bag is fake embossing to look like leather, and there is NO leather smell. There IS a smell of polyurethane.  Also, on any leather handbag, you can see places like on the straps where there is suede/leather, and all the straps on this bag are heat sealed closed. Definitely plastic. BEWARE...you cannot send this back because it comes from Hong Kong.  BEWARE."
1.0,"Bought two straps from this seller; one black and one brown.  The quality of the straps is quite good and would deserve a higher rating.  The problem, though, is that the brown strap was missing the band that the tail end of the strap tucks into.  The black strap has the band.<br /><br />I communicated with the seller about the missing band and even sent them a couple of pictures.  Their response was that all their straps all ship with bands.  I guess they don't believe me.  I now have a brown strap that is useless to me."
1.0,"Horrible quality, fake leather"
1.0,"Too small, color is dull, not bright like the pic. Material is cheap. It's so ugly!"
1.0,This definitely look like a $15-$20 dress. I returned it.
1.0,The sizing was good but the finish is already coming off.
1.0,"I guess you get what you pay for. There were strings, material is thin, just wasn't good to look at."
1.0,"Cheaply made, no lining, and itchy"
1.0,The necklaces only worked for a couple hours before they were running out of batteries. Not worth the money.
1.0,Did not come as picture showed
1.0,Thin and kinda short ..It‚Äôs great for a child
1.0,"I wash all of my clothes before I wear them. When it was done, the logo was gone, but you could see the outline of where it had been. It was also a bit small. I have ordered 5 other Asics brand shirts and none of them had either of these issues."
1.0,Smaller than pictured. Very cheap looking.
1.0,"I received 3 Los Angeles Apparel face masks.  The first time I washed them in the laundry, a strap on one of the masks got separated from the mask.  The second time I did laundry, the same thing happened with one of the two remaining masks.<br /><br />For comparison, I have been using a different set of reusable cloth masks for the last few months.  I've washed them in the laundry many times, and never had any problems with them."
1.0,I ordered these earrings thinking they would be a lot bigger and they get here and they are so small
1.0,Didn't fit right and to big. Nothing like pic
1.0,Not made for wide calf people. I spent most of my 12 hour shift fixing my socks
1.0,"These are absolute garbage. Poor suction, poor fit, fog up immediately and breached on the first use. Avoid."
1.0,"Definitely NOT a dress but thought it would be a cute shirt. It is a cute shirt but not very functional. The top pops up over your shoulders with minimal arm movement. It is quite tight but due to the constant movement, it runs your arms and is a bit uncomfortable. I guess it would be ok if you are going to an event where you don‚Äôt have to move your arms around."
1.0,"Very suprized that this a ""Official Grateful Dead Licensed Product.""  It appears below their apparel standards."
1.0,My husband bought these bands and one broke within the first hour of putting it on. The second is extremely uncomfortable - would not purchase again. Invest in the real thing directly from Motorola.
1.0,Terrible. I thought I‚Äôd spend a little extra money for a nicer pair of readers. This was the wrong choice. The plastic on the arm is peeling apart and splitting open after just one month of use. I take care of my glassses  and keep them in the case when I carry them in my purse. Total disappointment. Cheap junk.
1.0,I bought these at the end of May and have worn them 3 times. When I took them off yesterday the post broke off. I can honestly say that that has never happened to me before. It‚Äôs too late to return but I wanted future purchasers to be warned.
1.0,Very disappointed I think they ran of material because this is not an extra large
1.0,No lo pude usar
1.0,"Ordered a large for a 36DD and there was no way it was going to zip. Cute dress, but disappointed in the fit. Order 1-2 times your normal American size for this dress."
1.0,"Awful fit, way to small, gave to my petite older daughter, didn't fit, gave to my 15-year-old, didn't fit her, she's smaller than us...fits very weird in the crotch and doesn't fit at waist at all. Just very strange all the way around! Can't return them, it's past the return window.  :(  I don't know what to do with them!"
1.0,This shirt was extremely way to small! The shoulders wouldn't stay down. It was really awkward to wear and very uncomfortable!
1.0,"Shirt was made wrong. The middle of the sleeves were smaller than the rest of the sleeve. Therefore, too tight to wear. I was very disappointed.<br />~Not so Happy Mom :("
1.0,Ordered the beautiful white one that was on the photo. What arrived was an ugly yellow and black one instead. It was the ugliest thing I ever saw. Called immediately to return it. Was told to keep it or just donate it.
1.0,"I did not like the fact that the product did not fit me the way I expected it to. I wear an extra large and purchased an XL, but when I wore it, the shirt clung to my torso as if it was an XS. It felt very restricting. The material was also a little itchy."
1.0,String pulled out which makes this almost useless to me
1.0,Comes unclasped! Fell off my arm and broke my watch! Very disappointed
1.0,This is literally a moccasin with zero sole. Not good for any walking toddler. It‚Äôs likexwalking on cloth.
1.0,These look Nothing like the picture!!!!<br />DULL.  NO FACETS.  NO SHINE.  VERY UGLY.<br />I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR.  CHEAP.
1.0,"Prongs on these stones are high, sharp and the ring is dangerous."
1.0,The picture of the dress in the model is very off from what the real thing is. It's more of a burnt red than an actual wine red/magenta like you see in the model photo. It also wore more like a lingerie piece. Returning.
1.0,Way too small! Unless you have less than size 6 woman‚Äôs shoe don‚Äôt bother. These are child size socks!
1.0,Received one pair and they dont fit wingfold.  Cannot attach them as no attachment point
1.0,Super cute but the opening for the arms are nearly impossible to get in and out of.
1.0,ALL OF THE BUTTONS POPPED OFF AFTER ONLY WASHING A FEW TIMES!!  I want my money back.
1.0,Very thin material easy to fall apart
1.0,Worst amazon purchase ever. The strings were tangled beyond hell and a totally different color than pictured. I wound up tossing it in the bonfire one night because I was so frustrated at trying to untangle the stupid strings.
1.0,"UPDATE 11/20/15: I took this bag on a trip right after i received it and when I wet to pick it up at the airport to board the plane the strap ripped completely off! Super disappointed that apparently it is such poor quality to rip clean off after one time use! Will definitely be requesting a refund.<br />This bag is everything I was expecting and more! Lots of pockets and space, perfect for travel or every day use plus I LOVE that I can actually feel stylish while lugging my laptop around. The only thing is the colors seem to be a lot different in person than online. I ordered the mauve one first because online it looked like almost an iridescent purple, but when I got it it was definitely more of a baby pink. I wasn't a fan of the color so I sent it back and exchanged it for the purple, which isn't as dark in person as it shows online. Just expect the color to be a lighter shade when you oder, at least with the mauve and purple. Obviously this isn't a problem for me as I still gave it 5 stars and the purple was exactly what I was hoping for, but if you're very particular about the color just be prepared."
1.0,This look like I was being squeezed like a sausage link. Was not flattering at all
1.0,This was horrible! I got it for a summer camp trip. Too cheap! Spend the extra 8 bucks for a name brand. Its basically a windbreaker.
1.0,Cheap. Low Quality. Sent back
1.0,"Bought a Medium and it was really tight, sleeves too loose and long. Material was very cheap."
1.0,Cheap! Fell apart with normal use. I don‚Äôt get it wet. I take off to sleep and it fell apart while at work. Almost broke my Apple Watch. Very angry. Not a cheap watch to almost break. Don‚Äôt waste your money unless you want to end up having to buy a new watch.
1.0,Es la mascarilla m√°s mala que he podido comprar lo m√°s inc√≥modo y no protege nada
1.0,This would have been very cute but the top was way too small while bottoms were way too large. Had to return
1.0,This was Cheaply made! In one day It fell apart!  I've been in the hospital so I couldn't return it! I would love to send this back so I can get my money back!
1.0,Ugly and way oversized.
1.0,üò°üò°
1.0,Ordered 2 of these at the same time‚Ä¶came two different days.. first one was fine. Second one was broken before I even took it out the packaging. Made in China. Yay.
1.0,Very disappointed. Purchased a 100 of these for an event. GloFX logo is on both sides of glasses (which I expected) but the entire inside of the frame is obnoxiously busy copy on how to order custom version of these and other glasses. I didn‚Äôt expect to pay money to hand out advertisements for GloFX.
1.0,"This is more polyester than cotton which is really disappointing since it says ""cotton"" with polyester and spandex blend. There is more polyester than Anthony in this. It also runs small and doesn't match American sizes so go two sizes up if possible."
1.0,"I love echidna's so I was really excited about these socks but even though I only wear a size 7 women's shoe there was no way I could get my foot into these very thin, very small socks."
1.0,This ripped in the collar after one wear. I didn‚Äôt pull on it nor was I rough with it. I also followed the washing directions. I‚Äôm very disappointed.
1.0,"I was super excited about buying these shoes as a gift for my 5yr daughter‚Äôs birthday. They arrived right in time. However, my excitement was short lived because as soon as I opened the box I noticed large scuff marks on the front of not one but both shoes! Now I‚Äôm scrambling to find light up shoes right before my daughter‚Äôs birthday who she has been asking a pair after seeing light shoes in a store."
1.0,I‚Äôm a little annoyed they had to write ‚ÄúIslamic‚Äù in the name of the shirt .
1.0,"I would snap a pic but it wouldn‚Äôt be a pretty sight‚Ä¶ this whole underwear ends up in my rear after taking two steps in it. I am 5 feet 115lb with 34B chest and size large underwear (size 8 women‚Äôs). It‚Äôs difficult to find underwear perfectly soft like this and supportive like this, but it just doesn‚Äôt fail to find an entrance into my insides from below‚Ä¶ noooooo thanks."
1.0,"This top looks nothing like the picture. The color was very different, and it‚Äôs so long that it fits like a sleep shirt, just above the knee."
1.0,"Big and bulky,"
1.0,Thin to point of being see through
1.0,To large  Don't like it at all
1.0,Came with no strap.  That was the reason I bought it.
1.0,If zero stars were an option I‚Äôd choose it. The dress is falsely advertised as shown in photo. Made of spandex not rayon. Dress is very large and will not shrink since it isn‚Äôt rayon and is spandex.
1.0,"Out of the entire pack of earrings, only 1 pair came intact. All of the pearls were off the settings. I‚Äôll have to go superglue them back on. The saying is true, we get what we pay for."
1.0,"I should have paid attention to Patrick. I was much taken by the clear red shown on the web site. But, I got a muddy brown disc instead. What a swindle."
1.0,"Productis poorly made,oversized and would not stay on.the middle nose piece moved from side to side and was not secured and eventually fell off, once this fell off the middle cracked. This was within one week of use."
1.0,Way too tight.  These are from China so sizes are suspect.
1.0,the button side piece that holds the visors came loose/off within 1 week.
1.0,Terrible product. This is so false advertising. This doesnt even cover my behind. Seriously should have just thrown my money away.
1.0,"They look good but half did not come back from the first trip.<br />They look nice, but not durable"
1.0,Sticky is painful. Returned.
1.0,I tried piercing my ears but the earrings bent. I want my money back.
1.0,"Adhesive is only on the edges and the center of the screen protector does not lay flat on the screen.  Since the screen protector does not touch much of the screen you have to press very hard for the phone to respond.  Look elsewhere, this is a waste of time and money."
1.0,it doesnt sit on your ear like that.... it doesnt sit on your ear at all actually
1.0,Was so excited for this dress.<br />I was disappointed in the fit.<br />Difficult to put on.<br />I returned it.
1.0,"I am returning this. The quality is miserable. I would never, ever wear this. It would not look good on anyone. It is cheap fabric, the print is not what is pictured, it's not fit for human apparel."
1.0,The product is very different from the one on the photo.
1.0,"Very hard to get on,when I did they hurt the calf of leg ,and I'm a woman with small legs can't imagine a man trying to put them on,what a waste money"
1.0,"Material is completely see through, no way you could wear it as a outfit unless you wore clothes underneath it. So bummed."
1.0,They are made for a twig way to small and more bikini then they were boy shorts
1.0,It didn‚Äôt work ü§®
1.0,"I RETURNED THIS, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1.0,"Wayyy too small even though I ordered a size up, itchy and non stretch fabric. Sad because it was really cute."
1.0,"Warning, Grace Karin dresses are horrible and cheap. I have ordered several on Amazon and each was worse than the last. The pictures do not show the cheap, scratchy material."
1.0,"Mask in product photos was Not what I received. Mine was all lace, No inside liner. Super disappointed."
1.0,"i was excited for these to come. shipping took over a month. they are so small, it doesnt fit any piercing i have. they would even be small on a baby. the balls didnt wannna come off.i dont like them at all. not a fan. not even worth shipping them back i just threw them away. not worth the time. not reccomended. i also bought a bar bell, on the other hand the bar bell was amazing. guess it depends on what you buy."
1.0,Way small must be china size return and credit went well
1.0,"If anything these accentuate any type of ‚Äúpooch‚Äù or ‚Äúbelly‚Äù. The material feels nice, just does not do what is claims."
1.0,"Don't do it unless you want dye all over your bedding, forehead and body. 1st night using my bedding is damaged."
1.0,Pants don't fit well it is  short the foot is big it's just a ugly fitting  Pants
1.0,Was hard to use
1.0,Size issue..
1.0,Sewed together very weird - did not last long at all!  Would not recommend
1.0,-30 degrees my ass. These gloves left my hands ice cold on my hunt. Glad I brought a backup pair with me.
1.0,"I have been through several of this type of wallet recently. The problem i find with all these wallets with outside pocket for cards is, the cards start falling out after a while. This recent one, unless you put a bunch of cards in , they fall out. I had 4 cards in the outside pocket and they fell out several times."
1.0,"I finally got a chance to start this program and the DVDs are freezing and skipping. This makes working out very difficult so I had to go back to some old DVD's, I'm very disappointed"
1.0,Not satisfied with this product at all.
1.0,They came in damaged and by the time I got around to try and return them it was too late!!!
1.0,Terrible<br />Broke
1.0,Scratches easily. It loses its color
1.0,Cheaply made bad stitching
1.0,Muy peque√±o en la cintura lo dem√°s qued√≥ bien
1.0,"My daughter ordered this for herself. It took 2 months to get it here and was almost a week over the delivery date. I understand it comes from China but that was too long. As soon as she got it out of the box, the chain broke. Very cheap. I would not recommend buying this product."
1.0,"This handbag is beautiful, but it's huge! Pics are misleading. Returning."
1.0,Item is at least 2 sizes bigger than a women's small. Vendor will not pay for return postage and only accepts usps returns. Do NOT buy from this vendor.
1.0,Would like to give minus 5 stars but wont let me Worst product EVER!!!! They say they are made and will hold up larger sizes but they DO NOT !<br /><br />Then it said refund started so I was waiting to get that info to return but never did now it says its past the return stage so I'm stuck with crap that doesn't work . Completely useless!!!
1.0,Very cheap Dollar Store glasses they were not looks at all wasted money will never buy again
1.0,The material was like an old Halloween costume or burlap bag! They were pretty ish.  not what I expected! The picture looks like jeans and they were most definitely NOT!!!!
1.0,"I really wanted to like this band. Sadly, though it looks great and feels comfortable on the wrist, the clasp has the annoying habit of coming undone at any given moment. At the dinner table, while out at a bar, anywhere you might brush the inside of your wrist against anything, you risk this band abruptly freeing your wrist of whatever watch you've affixed it to. Look elsewhere..."
1.0,Poor quality pins broke after a week
1.0,Pearls too big
1.0,Watch arrived broken. Arrived in 5 days instead of 2 with amazon prime.
1.0,"This dress is poorly made. I was so disappointed. The front gathering doesn't even line up, one side is inches below the other. I even gave it a second shot and ordered a second dress hoping it was just a fluke. But they were both so far off."
1.0,"This product is very thin! You can see right through them! More like wide leg leggings.  Loose stitches. But what really pisses me off is that there was only one, not 3!  Definitely not worth the price for one. I am sending back."
1.0,"The fabric looks like a cheap napkin, the ""embroidery"" is a cheap stencil, or printed on, and the tassels on the bottom are sparse and each tassel is made up of about 10 strands of very light weight thread.  JUST HORRIBLE!"
1.0,"The sizing is way off cheaply made, can‚Äôt even wear it way to small and ordered a size larger just to make sure. Very disappointing"
1.0,"Out of the pack of 6 only 4 fit perfectly, 2 are too small (one black one, one white one). I wear size 6 and ordered medium. I like the fit (of the 4 that do fit) and quality of the panties. They are maybe a bit heavier than I'd like, but I could live with that.<br />What I can't live with is the horrible waist band. It is rigid, hard to the touch, and about 3 times wider than is needed. While the band has &#34;give&#34;, what doesn't have give is the thread that was used to sew it on to the panties. I washed one pair, hoping the waist band might soften, but that didn't happen. On the positive side, I put them in the dryer and there was no shrinkage. I am trying to replace my PERFECT Hanes satin panties (64% polyester, 31% nylon, 5%Spandex) it seems they have disappeared off the face of this earth. My search continues.<br />A couple of readers wrote there was a strong odor. I noticed the grey pair has a strong odor, but nothing too bad. Someone else mentioned there was no cotton crotch, but all 6 I received have cotton crotches.<br />Bottom line, 1/3 doesn't fit, the waist band makes them unwearable.<br />Waisted my money!"
1.0,wasnt the right size it seem like a child size want my refund
1.0,5 hours later after buying them. They burned and cut the back of my knees..
1.0,"did not fit me at all. returned,and i will not buy again."
1.0,It lasted for a day. very cheap
1.0,I just did not like this. At all.
1.0,I wanted raccoons. I didn't get racoons. I got some other weird animal. Not even pictured here.
1.0,Never order this again the material is so cheap and its not same as it shown in picture
1.0,"They don't hold anything in, just like a regular tank top."
1.0,Poor stitching...oversized... itchy to the body
1.0,Guess you get what you pay for!!
1.0,Design is good but poor quality material. You can't expect more for the price. Retuning mine.
1.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and these are far too short. They only go to my ankle if sagged down very low.
1.0,"Too short and see thru, no thanks. Returned.<br /><br />Clarification: I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and really wanted a full length (to my ankles) maxi dress...this was not it."
1.0,"The sleeves were flared and long (i have pretty short arms), but perfect until I washed it. Sleeves lost about 3 inches of length and are now too short on me. No longer flared and wont un-wrinkle without an iron. length lost several inches as well in cold wash. Don't waste your money. I have so many more dress that are better than this from yesstyle that were half the cost and wash well."
1.0,This is not worth $1!!! Unfortunately I bought in October and put away for Christmas without looking at it!!! I'm astonished how poorly made a watch could be but this is awful!
1.0,Not true to size. Way too small. Returnes.
1.0,Does NOT have or look like glitter. Looks like pixels! Returning..
1.0,"The quality was lacking. The top part of the swimsuit did not fit correctly even though there was padding/built in bra. It was too spread out. Material was uncomfortable, although the style was cute. It just did not fit or flatter my body type."
1.0,"The concept is good, but the design is not. I have worn these twice in the past few days, riding approximately 200 miles in the rain. These gloves will not stay tight over my fingers, and after a few miles they bunch up, and my fingers end up back in the palm. In this situation you have poor control and the dexterity they were designed for doesn‚Äôt exist. They have a built in drawstring, but in my situation it only helps to pull the cuff tight.<br />They need some type of elastic in the wrist area to help hold them in place."
1.0,This product tore down the entire middle due to poor stitching
1.0,The post broke off the earring the first time the person I gave them to as a gift tried to wear them.
1.0,Started off great but now the gold is rubbing off and I am having a reaction to the material under the gold making me believe they are not sterling silver
1.0,"Didn't work for my watch, then try to tell them and they argue saying it did when I took the watch to the watch store and they also said band not compatible"
1.0,I am disappointed with these flip flops as they are not comfortable. That is a shame because the fit is perfect but too uncomfortable to keep.
1.0,Product is way too small.
1.0,Cute but didn‚Äôt even open package and it was broken already.
1.0,Product was a gift for a friend and has been delayed arriving for several days!<br />I keep getting notifications!<br />Very embarrassing!
1.0,This runs small.  I had to return it was so small.
1.0,I ordered both sizes and the smaller is too small to even go on. The larger ones won‚Äôt stay on the ear piece if you have to take your glasses off for some reason.
1.0,It was so cheap it broke within a day!
1.0,"It looked fine when it got delivered. I used it only tree times, the leather at the corners started to scratched off. I gave it to my sister as a gift. I'm so disappointed with the quality. I would not buy it again!"
1.0,"Sent me the wrong dress. Poorly made, and too small at the bust."
1.0,Wanted the khaki belt with gold buckle.  Khaki was fine but the gold buckle looked spray painted with runs and it was a very dull color.  Sent it back.
1.0,Material felt awful.. like weird paper and rips easily. Also I ordered the xl and it was way too tight and I only weigh 138lbs and an 5‚Äô4‚Äù.. returned item!
1.0,"The material is cheap looking , to small, poor quality . Would return gave to friend for pajama top , instead of blouse."
1.0,Llego con el zipper da√±ado...
1.0,"I don't know if these shoes were meant for children or what. But I put them on and they were way too small, even though I ordered them in my size. Don't waste your time if you have big feet. I'm a size 10 in womens shoes."
1.0,"These are very thin, and run very small. I wanted a L/XL and these looked like a shmedium. Gifted them to a friend."
1.0,This scarf was advertised as cotton and linen. HA! It is polyester. I hate polyester. What a rip off. I'm returning it. The color gray and style were fine.
1.0,"Was very disappointed in this robe, ran very small, was short, hood wouldn‚Äôt even fit her head. I returned it today."
1.0,It fit loose in some areas tight in others. Did not help my shape.
1.0,Awful product! The clasp literally broke the second I tried to put it on. Would not recommend.
1.0,Sizing was off tight in some areas and loose in others
1.0,"Very disappointed in the quality as the one I bought literally fell apart as I opened the little zippy bag it was in. Now I have to figure out how to glue it together. The quality is meant for a child age 5 -7. Beyond that the quality‚Äôs not there.  I am extra disappointed as I bought this for my 20 year old daughter who LOVES horses. The picture made it look A LOT nicer than it is in person. I wasn‚Äôt expecting super high quality for the price,  but NOT bubble gum Machine quality either."
1.0,Well I guess it is &#34;ok&#34; for the price but looks terrible - has nothing to do with the photo!. Very weird fit and the quality almost does not exist (again you get what you paid for I guess). Would not recommend.
1.0,"I always get Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda jeans ,as they always fit me well even  as I‚Äôve increased in size over the years.üò¢"
1.0,The fabric is very cheap and looks very cheap
1.0,"This dress does not deserve any stars.  The item was delivered on time. However, when trying on the dress, the material was very thin.  Almost like toilet paper thin.  You can see through the whole entire dress.  The top part of the dress was extremely large and did not fit my chest area. I am extremely disappointed and upset with this purchase.  The dress does not look and is not as described on the website.  I was hoping to use this for my engagement shoot(in a day) and not I am left dress less."
1.0,"Garbage, literally threw it away."
1.0,All it does is make the bright white lights yellow bright lights.
1.0,Thought they were cute. Put them on stood up and the heel broke immediately. Not durable at all. They said I could get a refund but had to pay return shipping charge. Not happy with this one at all.
1.0,"This is not the same sweatshirt the girl in the picture is wearing. The girl in the picture is wearing a cotton shirt that is form-fitting around the bottom. The one I got is not cotton, which is my fault because the description does say it's polyester. However, again, the girl in the picture is wearing a cotton form-fitting sweatshirt. My sweatshirt is very loose and large. I ordered a small. It fits on the top correctly but it is loose on the bottom. Looks like I'm wearing my husband's sweatshirt. This was a deceiving advertisement due to the woman wearing a totally different sweatshirt."
1.0,Love this purse but.....tha zipper will not budge and I‚Äôm about to send it back because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna rip it open it I‚Äôm afraid to even try to open it
1.0,"For the price I paid, it is cheaply made and the measurements are all wrong, Sent it back."
1.0,"I did not like this robe it did not have a size on it and it was way too small, not returning it"
1.0,Product was defective but I just kept them-too much of a hassle to return!
1.0,"EXTREMELY SMALL!!! If you decide to buy, order 2 sizes or more up."
1.0,Turned me and all my friends green -.-
1.0,REALLY UGLY AND THE DON'T LET YOU RETURNED VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED
1.0,It did not fit write for me. Stayed up way above the bra line .
1.0,"The purse was very cute, looks just like image. However, the chain was very cheap quality. The chain came apart three times my first time wearing. Tried to tighten all chains and still wouldn't hold for a &#34;normal&#34; wear. Very disappointed as I really liked the purse."
1.0,"If you hide in a hole it might be ok,  if I could send it back I would it doesn't do what it claims and has horrible craftsmanship.  Buy anything else!!"
1.0,They stretched out more every time you wear them. After about 20 times wearing them they end up stretched to the point you can‚Äôt wear them as sleeves cause they are constantly falling down for several times earlier.
1.0,awkward pucker and strap placement at the bust.  Top not properly cut for women's breasts.
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL AND NOT QUALITY MATERIAL
1.0,This is neon orange and the brightest version I've ever seen. I neglected to return this item within the return window so I donated it. My sympathies for the person who wears this.
1.0,Way smaller than should be for the size I ordered. I got a 3x....it fits like an xl
1.0,"Very short torso on this. Might work for a child or very small woman. Sent back, couldn't even use it as an around the house outfit."
1.0,"Pretty earrings, but terrible quality. First time I wore them, the back piece broke and my earring fell off on the floor of the restaurant."
1.0,2 of the 3 bracelets broke. We didn't get to enjoy them. So sad. Although we loved them.
1.0,Too difficult to put on.  I would like to return this and credit my account.  Thanks.  Susan Zulauf
1.0,Old phone style. You can‚Äôt blue tooth to this purse.
1.0,"Do not wasted your time!! Received a totally different dress. Looks like they just sew it with threads hanging from everywhere on the dress, threw in a bag and send it. Not even the same material, pattern, and design. Not worth it..don‚Äôt waste your money!!"
1.0,"Piece of garbage, broke after only a couple days of wearing it. Def got my moneys worth..."
1.0,Very thin and cheaply made. 0 stars
1.0,Completely see threw
1.0,Did not look as it appeared
1.0,"The material is not cotton. My daughter has worn this pajama 3 times and once washed the color turned really dull and you can deft see this is not cotton material.<br />Additionally, the pants ripped in the mid section."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:b754ce80204304659977e0e241f5ed70]] Horrible packaging! Wrinkled shirt! Huge!
1.0,"Very stiff fabric and though I ordered small using the sizing chart, the dress was huge. It felt like I was wearing a bag."
1.0,"This item is NOT the discontinued Sage Low, do not buy these unless you‚Äôre willing to pay this astoundingly high price for shoes that you can find for half as much‚Ä¶ these are the AF1 07 which is the standard release right now. Would give zero stars if I could!"
1.0,This watch looks great but broke after wearing it for one night.
1.0,"I was hoping the Size reducer would fit around the entire inside of the hat in order to reduce the size. I now know that I should have purchased two of the Dorfman Cotton Terry Size Reducer and Sweatbands in order to get a good fit and complete sweatband coverage. To reflect what other's have written, peeling the backing from the adhesive strip was very difficult and time consuming. After all that work, the adhesive strip failed quickly, so basically, I have a strip of terrycloth that is useless. Don't waste your money or time on this product."
1.0,way too small! and I ordered 2 sizes up. does not drape like the pic and is very short.
1.0,"The metal buckle came apart, like it was ripped apart from the belt itself. There is a little fold out manual that makes it look like you can attach the metal buckle to the belt, but the buckle in the pick and it's mechanisms don't match up to the one in the picture shown in the manual. All I wanted was a simple reversible belt with buckle attached like I have seen all of my life in stores. This was a complete waste of money!"
1.0,I was hoping to wear this skirt for a 90's party. However I am returning it because it was extremely to small and short
1.0,"The band covers the sensor and when you are in bright lights or outside, you cannot see the screen.  That's a bad design flaw."
1.0,"Poor quality. Although, nice design."
1.0,Band has a hard plastic piece bent straight down. No way this is large. Cannot fit my husband‚Äôs wrist.
1.0,This is a track jacket not an actual sweater.
1.0,Cheap and not worth your money
1.0,Mask is loose.
1.0,"Purchased these due to severe arthritis, but these shoes were the WORST! They were too small/snug once inserts were in and for the cost they weren't well made. Felt very odd as you walked in them. Do NOT recommend!"
1.0,so~~~~
1.0,"1. It stretches significantly after some time. Mine was tight, now it flips over on my wrist when I drive my car, or move my wrist around a lot.<br />2. It discolors, especially the white<br />3. It‚Äôs very lose in the watch itself, I don‚Äôt trust holding my arm out the window when I drive my car and won‚Äôt wear it when I ride my street bike afraid it will come off.<br /><br />I switched back to my silicone band it‚Äôs much less stretched, much more secure, and doesn‚Äôt discolor. This is definitely not a worthy Apple-brand, your friends will know it‚Äôs a cheap copy."
1.0,I'm a size 14. Way too small. I had to return
1.0,Very thin and cheaply made. My little one refused to wear them when they finally fit.
1.0,Dress shrank first washing in cold water.  It started piling immediately.
1.0,It came with the huge hole in the back
1.0,Fits extremely tight and very cheaply made strings hanging and this material.
1.0,The necklace broke as soon as I put it on<br />I complained to seller but heard nothing back
1.0,"Didn‚Äôt like the tanks and fit small, not true to size very disappointed!"
1.0,"Packaged in a small bendable plastic box, which broke the product!<br />Very disappointing!"
1.0,It is nowhere near the right color!  I‚Äôm so disappointed!  At least amazon has easy returns!!
1.0,This watch band was impossibly to open and close. It is cheaply made and non-functional. I'm sorry I wasted mymoney. I did not get around to returning it right away and will have to swallow the loss.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:6bb25f1910b7193b0e3ac0977fd24b42]] I did not expect such a poor quality I also expected the neck of it in the back to be a whole lot different to where it fit comfortably i do not recommend this unless theres no other choice!
1.0,üëéüèª Very poor quality .
1.0,Runs big and it is not flattering.
1.0,I loved the belt but the leather separated.  I contacted customer service but never heard back.  It was too late to return per amazon.  Too bad. Beautiful belt but didn't last
1.0,Very thin material. Tears easily.
1.0,Very cheap see through material.
1.0,Not what expected doesn't even fit over cartilage
1.0,I purchased this for work however I cannot wear to work unless I wear another layer underneath as it is see through. I try to not wear layers as it is warm there. Very thin material.
1.0,I am extremely disappointed in this purchase.  These run really short and look nothing like they do in the picture.  The material is extremely thin and cheap feeling.
1.0,"The zipper will not zip closed. The zipper is stuck and will not zip up or down. The color is great but that makes it more disappointing that I can't wear them. This was defective fresh out of the box. I ordered the same jeans in two other colors and the other jeans are great, no issues, but this pair is defective."
1.0,"not  sturdy balls will easily break and fall off , i woke up with it out of my nose even though i tightened it"
1.0,I purchased 2 versions of this bandana they arrived with $4.99 printed prices on them they charged me over $13.00 for one and over $7.00 for the other. They are thin so thin you can see through them. Low quality stupid high price basically cheating amazon customers. DO NOT BUY
1.0,Swollen ears 2 hours later. Waste of money
1.0,Looks like kids earrings but also big
1.0,"These pants were made for sponge bob square pants. Because that‚Äôs how they fit, boxy. No hip room, no stretch or give. Please take heed of the reviews."
1.0,Desafortunadamente mancha toda la ropa clara.
1.0,"Got this today.  The watch face and bezels are beautiful for the price but it was matched with a silver buckle. How deflating.  Replacement bands are hard to find.  In fact, I can't find a band similar but with a gold buckle."
1.0,"Terrible, I received the box with not item in it, now I do not have a gift or give on Mother's Day."
1.0,All different sizes. Too short for any man over 5'10&#34;.<br /><br />Returned.
1.0,Horrible. Very cheaply made sent from China. Wanted to return. But I would have to pay the postage. Way to much to China.<br />Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,"I really wanted to purchase these I couldn‚Äôt image how they were selling 18k white gold for the price. I had to read forever to see the ‚Äúgold plating‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry, I really wanted these."
1.0,"Doesn‚Äôt last.  After only 5 months the piece holding the emblem to the key chain broke as I pulled the keys, from my pocket.  Don‚Äôt waste money."
1.0,"the color is very decieving, its super cute style just not the color I expected (BRIGHT RED) when the picture shows more darker"
1.0,Stem is cased in the white plastic so tightly that I'm unable to pull it out to change the time.
1.0,"I received a wrong size, it was a manufacture issue since the jean has came with the 2 size information, If I had place the order with the wrong size I will keep the order and go on, but Im sure what I ask for and more upset when they offer me $6.19 as compensation or send it back and wait for my refund. In my case I placed the order as I need it. As a customer Im not satisfied."
1.0,"You get what you pay for,  lop sided and cheap although did come earlier than expected"
1.0,"This suit did not holdup at all.<br />Seems are freying, and the elastic bands are showing thru.<br />Very disappointed for the money we spent on this!"
1.0,"These are very poor quality, please ignore what others are saying. They are made out of sack cloth,they fit large not small. They also have a weird pleather square on the front and back. What is pictured is not what you get. This is pretty much a Wish product."
1.0,"Do yourself a favor and get a better bag. This one lacked strap adjustments, and parts of it tore very easily. Very uncomfortable. I don't think it's actually 75 L I think it's smaller"
1.0,I recieved a package that supposed to have 3 items including this Keychain but there was No Keychain in the package.  Very disappointed
1.0,Product is seconds. Damaged and discolored with arrow stickers everywhere there is a flaw.<br /><br />DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THESE REJECTED SHIRTS !
1.0,The 2x is the size of medium in America. Quality is good.
1.0,I was hoping that the T-shirt run big. It looks like it should be oversized but it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm a true medium but ordered a large and it still fit fitted.
1.0,I‚Äôm infuriated that after spending so much money this purse arrived damaged. There are multiple deep tears in the leather. This is absolutely not acceptable. Will never purchase from this seller again.
1.0,Ridiculous. Too small for my hand
1.0,The earring is so flimsy and would not latch. Do not buy if you‚Äôre wanting earrings that last!!
1.0,I had to roll the sleeves and some of the fabric on the vest was frayed. One of the buttons was broken.
1.0,The cowl on the one I received looks nothing like the photo. Material is cheap and stiff. Runs small. There is really not much good I can say about this..
1.0,"I'm not sure how the second section is supposed to fit in regular earrings holes, much too large to fit through O rings that connect to the hanging curve.üò≠üò≠üò≠"
1.0,"If I could negative stars I would but it's forcing me to give one. This is THE ugliest dress I've ever tried on. First, it's IMPOSSIBLE to put on by yourself, you MUST have someone standing there for 20 mins to lace up the back. Then once I got it on, there was so much extra material in the mid section that it sticks out like a pooch and makes me look fat! No form fit anywhere even with the lace up back. The hem on the top of the bust is rolled over and looks cheap. Then when I went to pull it off, the inner lining isn't fully attached so pulls inside out over the dress. Just trying this on took 30 mins... I wear a size 10 but my measurements fit the size 12. I have a ball in 3 days and no idea what I'm gonna do. For $150 I expected way better quality."
1.0,There‚Äôs no way these are plated with genuine 14k gold. They tarnished within a few hours of wear. Highly doubt the brown/tarnished metal underneath is ‚Äústerling silver.‚Äù Waste of money. Could‚Äôve got the same thing from the beauty supply or dollar store.
1.0,Broke in 5 days.
1.0,"This was not 18g and after practically forcing it in, I could still see the stud in my nose."
1.0,"Unfortunately, like almost every band on Amazon, the pin falls out at the slightest bump. The comfort was ok. They‚Äôre pretty wide and too hot for summer. Not good for swimming and I don‚Äôt like that I have to take it off to shower. Will be returning these."
1.0,Item doesn‚Äôt look as great as it do on the picture
1.0,"It looks exactly like my original Fitbit Surge band and fits snugly into place...but that's where my satisfaction ends and bitter disappointments begins.  The problem with this replacement band is that it is stiff, non-flexible, non-pliable, not all that comfortable on the wrist, and a cheap imitation; it does not perform like the soft, highly-flexible and very comfortable original Fitbit Surge band that, to me, felt more like wet-suit material and not like this...plastic.  To be honest, I would have gladly paid more than double the price to get a genuine Fitbit Surge replacement band but, sadly, just like the smartwatch, Fitbit no longer carries them in stock.  In all fairness, this is not a horrible product and will mostly work well enough for those who occasionally wear the Fitbit Surge.  However, if you like me and wear this smartwatch 16+ hours a day...you can do better - much, much better.  I just wish I know where to get one.  (as he shakes his head ruefully while taking the Amazon Failed Purchase walk of shame)."
1.0,Not the size I asked and one is broken ...<br />What a waste of money
1.0,"This is not a good gift to give someone in the Air Force.  It's more for a child wanting to play Air Force.  I was diappointed with the quality.  I ended up giving the key chains (they come in a pack of 6) to the kids, who loved them."
1.0,very disappointed to find the color description to a lie. The black is not black but navy instead. There was also a big stitching error at the neck of the shirt as shown in the photo. The quality of the shirt seems as I expected but it is not what I ordered based on the color
1.0,Cheap thin material. Runs very small. Shirt length is short. Ankle closer is very tight and uncomfortable
1.0,"I am 250 lbs and 6'0"". Anything XXXL is too big, but I like it loose.  This was WAY too small around the belly.  So, ok, I get it.  But then the arms are way too long.  Says, ""made in china.""  What kind of XXXL people do they have there testing this?<br /><br />BTW- I ordered this for a test for uniforms for a very large operation.  So I was hoping it would work out, because everything is right, except the fit."
1.0,It broke on the first day. It wasn't what I expected.
1.0,The color was not as vivid as advertised.
1.0,Quality was not worth price paid.
1.0,"I really liked that they are soft, and fit very well, lots of compliments. But they got a hole in the stitching on the first day of wearing them. Very disappointed."
1.0,Never even got to put this on. It broke upon taking the tag off.
1.0,"The med size is about two sizes too big. And the blue color is actually a purple. Or they sent me the wrong color. It is now an oversized night gown.<br />Med, 5‚Äô7, 127lbs"
1.0,The whole dress
1.0,"Worst purchase ever. Way too small.ordered xl and got what looks like a medium. Material is slick and thin and feels like swimsuit material (shiny, too). Seam is coming apart in crotch area - right out of the package. I don't know how these pants have high reviews. Utter garbage."
1.0,"Extremely hard to try set the watch. Instructions were crap. Made of cheap materials. I know it wasn‚Äôt the most expensive watch, but it was just terrible. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to my worst enemy."
1.0,I will NEVER order from this company again!! Poor  stitching in  multiple areas. It‚Äôs basically falling apart. Very disappointed!!
1.0,Received a different black dress than the one pictured.
1.0,"This product is a regular, paper thin Santa hat with a very poor decal halfway ironed onto the hat.  When it arrived, the decal of the grinch was already peeling off.  don't waste your money."
1.0,The velco is already not sticking. I bought on July 12 so a little more than a month.
1.0,This fit way to big! Was made very poorly and it was two different colors! I just threw it away cause I couldn't even give it away! Very ugly and poorly made!
1.0,Terrible quality. The sequins were falling off of the dress as soon as I took it out of the bag. I returned the same day.
1.0,"The eyes were too close together, they fit tight. Not a good experience at all. Prettier in the photo, ugly when you receive them.<br /> :-(  I received these glasses in exchange for my honest opinion. #wearme_pro"
1.0,I WANT A REFUND
1.0,"Very difficult to open.  It naturally wants to open with the edges flipped up.  You have to manually turn the edges down every time you open it.  Also, we expected the flower image to be on the outside of the umbrella, but the print in on the inside.  So from the outside, it's a plain black umbrella.  You can only see the image when you're standing underneath the umbrella."
1.0,Center leather  was too loose on the leather  nice but when tightened  enter bulges
1.0,It does not run small it was to big a medium looks like a large
1.0,unless you are 5'10 super model this dress will look ridiculous on you. it made me look like a cow and I am 5'4 130lbs.
1.0,"Ordered this last week hoping to add to my collection of harem-esqe pants.  I think most people are pleased with them but on me, they just hung there in a rather unflattering way.  The fabric looked old and uninspiring.  Glad they worked for others- just not right for me."
1.0,I think the dollar store has better sunglasses than this.  flimsy.
1.0,Cheaply made. The plastic band is so stiff is won't lay down on your wrist as shown in the photo. Problem returning them.
1.0,Went up 2 sizes as suggested and it was still AWFUL. &#34;waist&#34; was across the middle of my breasts and pockets made hips flair out. The rest just fit completely weird. good thing I ordered a different one at the same time. This one was promptly returned.
1.0,"Everything looks good, except for the fact it shipped with 2 chains that are two big to fit in the in the hole for the medals or pendants."
1.0,please dont waist one red cent on this item  thinner than a dime and not even a drop of resin FAKE FAKE FAKE  this looks like western  but its not all resin  fake advertisement  not sorry for the warning
1.0,One of earrings was broken.
1.0,"These things are awful. Comfort is terrible, they fog up almost instantly indoor or outdoor. Vision is not clear maybe due to the curve but have tried using them for a week now and other than keeping the water out they are not good. Don‚Äôt buy these"
1.0,"I loved this shirt until I washed it, it  shrank. I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. I wore the shirt once and now it doesn‚Äôt fit."
1.0,The material was weird and was baggy on me
1.0,Too small. Ordered my size and too small. Gave to my daughter
1.0,The glasses are not what I expected  different glasses then what is advertised. Very disappointed
1.0,Don‚Äôt fit right and look like a cover and on top of that I had to pay to return it üòÇüòÇüòÇ what a joke
1.0,It didn't look like the picture at all
1.0,They said it would be  s m a l l  but  like  4 SIZES too SMALL!!  This shirt would not even fit my daughter!!  She is a medium & mine is a 3X  & that does not fit her???  Just AWFUL SIZING!!  TERRIBLE!!!!!!!
1.0,"Very cheaply made, didnt look like the picture. I waited to long to return them, I donated them."
1.0,Runs VERY large!! I am 5'6&#34; 125lbs and this was like a dress on me. Needed it for work and now I have to keep looking
1.0,It broke after 2 months. The dial is behind..
1.0,Love the look but I got it out of the package and instantly hated it. I‚Äôm not even sure what the material is but my first guess I‚Äôd plastic. And it stinks! Now I know why it was cheap. Runs small too. Had to return
1.0,"Very cheap, not sown properly"
1.0,"The item ran small, the fabric did not hang well and was uncomfortable."
1.0,Overrated.
1.0,"from the picture i expected this to hit below the hips, it is def at my waste, like does not cover my belt. its super thin, less fuzzy, and more rough than any sherpa i have ever felt before NOT soft at all.<br />Expect to have to wear something under it and size up."
1.0,I‚Äôll fitting. Really just weird all around. Not well made and had a smell.
1.0,Size is horrible. Fits around waist but giant in groin area. Order multiple sizes to try on and none fit well.
1.0,"Glasses were the wrong color and do not have the Quay logo on them, so don't believe they are authentic.  They also do not fit like the Quay's I had tried in stores recently."
1.0,missing nose and ear plugs
1.0,"It was cute, but it broke in less than 24hours of me receiving it.<br />I don't recommend this product."
1.0,Thought this would work but it doesn‚Äôt. 100% difficult to get on your wrist and doesn‚Äôt stay at all. Junk!
1.0,We are disappointed with this product and it is too big<br />I bough this shoes for my causin<br />They really deleivered very big shoes instead of kids one<br />I would say don't waste ur time
1.0,"Absolutely not worth the money, false advertising. Makes me angry at the cheap quality. It is not worth one star."
1.0,All my diamonds where falling off I wore for a day and they were falling off while wearing them
1.0,Cheap product. Plastic connector piece has already broke. Won‚Äôt close because of this. Do not bother buying this product! Made in China piece of crap! Made for the trash heap.
1.0,The metal tarnished and stained my ears.
1.0,"I bought the biggest size (2x) and the suit was still way too short in the torso length. I'm 5'8&#34;, in the in between fit and over weight size. I normally wear medium bottoms and an xl top because of very large breast. I'm not putting a picture because I couldn't even get it up over my boobs..."
1.0,"Junk, the bottom piece ‚Äúhandle‚Äù unglued after first gentle use!"
1.0,"My daughter is 3, and petite. I bought a size large and it barely fits her head and is very shallow (doesn‚Äôt come down very far on her head). The chin strap helps but she‚Äôs constantly tugging on it to make it fit."
1.0,Came misshapen and the slits for the eyes were not where they need to be and on one side it was poking backwards into my eye. Was not pleasant to wear for our haunted house.
1.0,It says its surgical steel but it turned my nose green so I highly doubt that. Can't return it so I just won't be buying anything from this company.
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE! This top is poor quality, too big on the hips and the elastic in the arms is so tight it‚Äôs extremely uncomfortable. They do not pay for return shipping to China so if you choose to return it, they will refund you but you have to pay the shipping cost to return it back. Otherwise, you‚Äôre not getting a refund! Very disappointed this was not disclosed anywhere in the description."
1.0,See thru which was unexpected
1.0,They are more than disappointing! Terrible!! Soooo small as to what‚Äôs pictured!!! No adult woman could wear.
1.0,"There was once a company name, Amazon. They had everything under the sun in there Customer Service was burning, but from time to time I feel like it's like. You get kicked where the sun don't shine."
1.0,Fabric terrible and has subs and pulls easily after one use
1.0,Strange materials for socks
1.0,To big bought this for my son he's two and it's huge
1.0,This was completely see through and horrible material. Material felt plasticy? the best way to describe it. Be aware there is a THICK zipper the going the full length. It also runs short. Not comfortable at all.
1.0,"Totally deceiving, this is way short and very poor quality."
1.0,"Very cheap shoes, I expected them to be cheap but not unwearable. Smaller than expected. Ordered the Army Green and was sent Navy Blue."
1.0,Sized wrong. Ordered the same thing a few months ago that fit fine. Ordered the same size and it is ridiculously small.
1.0,"I liked this because it was inexpensive and looked nice, however it ran very slow and stopped working after a week. Buttons are just for show, sundials never worked or moved"
1.0,I ordered a double xxl<br />I look like Peter Pan<br />They deliver fast though but if u have curves don't get them
1.0,"So I am usually an xs or a small and these look like they would fit a child. I‚Äôm sure they would stretch some like other ones I have from a different company, but they look so short and tiny.  They were also damaged where the seem goes down the butt to give it the scrunch booty there is a hole and looks used. Wow. I will update if someone reaches out."
1.0,"Watch stopped working after about a year, despite only being worn occasionally. Mickey Mouse works inside. Not worth the money."
1.0,"Cute in concept, but the actual design in bust area made it impossible to wear without major adjustments being made. Pattern and design were so cute in picture, reality fell short"
1.0,"Not comfortable for kids, my kid didn‚Äôt like ."
1.0,Got this item on discount..... Wish I wouldn't have spent the money on it.... It took a while to ship first off so I didn't have it when I wanted it. Then it did come and I go to try it on and I'm pretty sure it's an extra large in like child sizes. I'm normally a large any was worried about it being big on me but quite the opposite problem. I couldn't even get it on. The arms of it were very tight and I couldn't stand to have it on. If it wasn't two to three sizes smaller than what they said I might have liked this shirt ....
1.0,gave me a headache
1.0,Looks like a child‚Äôs toy. Poorly made. I threw it in the trash
1.0,I ordered this top in a medium which is my usual size. When I went to try it on I found it to be extremely loose all over. This top was especially wide and hung off my body in all directions when it is supposed to be a tight fit.
1.0,I just started using this as I had another that I had used for years and it was wearing out. I have not been using more than three months and it has already torn in the front where you put cards.<br />Such a shame....
1.0,"Poor quality, thin, cheap"
1.0,The description bday 4- 10 mm size sets but they are all different sizes
1.0,sorry seller exaggerated product description. not as descripted very inferior quality not worth the money. buyers be aware of this seller and his product descriptions
1.0,These gloves appear in the photo to be black and royal blue. However the blue was dark navy. And they looked like men‚Äôs work gloves.
1.0,Bought four and they all come broken. Only one survived. Cheaply made. Do not recommend!
1.0,"I don‚Äôt know what I expected, but it was cheap looking."
1.0,I was about to loose my new Apple watch. I was fishing on Bullshoals in Arkansas when the wrist of the watch came off and my watch crashed on the boat. I am really disappointed with the material used for this cover. The screen is of cheap quality. Please do not waste your money. I got deceived seeing the image. It does not look like this at all in real. Returning it back
1.0,"They look exactly as pictured however they absolutely slip. Very cheap, doesn‚Äôt even feel like a value at the $5-$6 mark. Absolutely useless as they do not stay in place. Not worth the effort to return but I‚Äôm not at all happy I have to use Bobby pins to keep in place."
1.0,"Very small even for a kid, I'm disappointed I was expecting something cool like the picture but not close, I don't recommend to buy it<br />I guess the idea of having 5 it's so you can tie up each other?"
1.0,I ordered white but i received beige why i don't know. I did not like at all very light materiel .
1.0,had to return - could not see anything with them on
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt use this right away, I probably have used it for like 2 months & the clip/latch has already broken."
1.0,It has sharp edges and a huge opening that the flap and buckle don't close. Things can easily fall out and/or get stolen from it
1.0,Dress runs too small. The dress barely comes to my daughter's butt. She is 5 and the dress fits like it was made for a 3 year old. Also cheaply made. There are strings hanging everywhere. I am definitely sending this back.
1.0,Product just didnt hold onto the glasses and also trapped heat and moisture. Maybe its just not for me but i wouldnt buy this again
1.0,not as advertised!!! not r.o.f.l.s brand!!!! does not fit right
1.0,They are real pretty but way to thin
1.0,Definitely doesn‚Äôt stay gold long.
1.0,"The stockings did not fit they were suppose to be size 4x no, no,"
1.0,It‚Äôs not like the picture at all!!! DONOT BUY!!!! This a medium and it‚Äôs closer to a XXXL.
1.0,The balls fall off
1.0,"So these are the third pair of these sunglasses I have purchased for my son. He's 9 and uses them for baseball. They look good for being so cheap. He likes them good enough. The problem I have is with this latest pair I received today. An incredibly vague warning label on the tag (which, admittedly I never looked at with previous pairs) stating that the glasses are made with some kind of hazardous chemical. If they weren't so cheap and not worth the hassle I would be returning them."
1.0,Quality of short does not meet expectations.
1.0,"This was not what I expected, it was dull, and looked nothing like the picture."
1.0,Extremely cheap. The clasp doesn't work and it's very small.
1.0,These are extremely flimsy
1.0,Huge and very bulky.  I returned them.  I should have checked the dimensions prior to ordering.
1.0,"Not actual leather, despite description"
1.0,"These sunglasses are teardrop aviators, not the true classic style. The picture and description are both inaccurate.<br /><br />The fit is poor for above average head size. The lenses are red, not the classic gold-brown (like the picture). The metal and build are quality."
1.0,"The shorts I received are good, but didn‚Äôt include the padded crotch insert, as described. This was very disappointing."
1.0,Horrible fit. Very cheaplyno made and seams were already loose. The top is not proportional to the bottoms or any human lifeform.
1.0,"Size says large but it looks like it was made for a 5 year old, would not give it sny stars at all except I have no other choice"
1.0,The latch that keeps this closed broke after a couple months of using it. I really liked the product when it worked. Now I need to find another alternative.
1.0,Ten of the 30 arrived broken. Terrible!
1.0,"Came with no belt poor stitching , cost to return it is more expensive than the dress . It‚Äôs in a bag in my closet ."
1.0,"I originally recommended this to friends but when I ordered another hat, the face shield is about an inch to short and does not actually fit over the bill of the hat.  DO NOT BUY THIS.  I purchased 4 of these and 3 of the 4 were defective."
1.0,fell apart the second day I wore it.
1.0,"Cute earrings, but no hooks!?"
1.0,"Cheap low quality one time use and disposable glasses. I couldn‚Äôt even use it for Halloween bc they were uncomfortable , unfitting and not good looking"
1.0,Brought two they both broken‚Ä¶ only used once.. too thin
1.0,"Extremely poor quality, sizing we recieved does not relate to what we ordered (item ordered in a 38, recieved a 2XL), and did not even receive the correct color (ordered the blue and received orange). To top it all off, as he was trying to tighten the drawstring (a completely different design than was advertised by the way) the material PRACTICALLY DISINTEGRATED.<br />Worst part is that this was a last minute order for a cruise. We picked up the package as we were leaving the city and now we have no option but live with this piece of trash. I would leave 0 stars if I could, but as that is not an option a single star will have to do."
1.0,They fit to small
1.0,"Not soft, like hospital slippers, very uncomfortable. Not going to send back will donate to goodwill!"
1.0,Only lasted a month before they started to fall apart at the straps.
1.0,They are too gaudy for me I like dainty
1.0,Nothing like the picture at all.
1.0,"The material feels like it should be the lining of a dress, in a stretch material, not the actual dress. Felt very cheap. I thought it was awful, so I returned it."
1.0,Installed in my air Force 1s and they cut my foot
1.0,Not true to size at all and uncomfortable between toes
1.0,What a waste of money?! This strap broke after less than 4 months of normal use. So bummed.
1.0,Horrible jean look nothing like the pic don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,"Not attractive for my body type! I am y‚Äôall and curvy and it clung to me in all the wrong places. Also, material felt super cheap."
1.0,"I had high hopes that they would fit, since it specifically says ""wide"". If you have a narrow or regular foot, it would be perfect for you!"
1.0,had to sew the 2 front pockets there were holes in both
1.0,Ordered a 2XL to wear with Halloween leggings. Usually wear XL in shirts. Was more like a size LG. Was long enough but to tight. I did Like the weight and feel of the material.
1.0,Ordered the size accordingly! Too small around the stomach area and too short! Contacted the seller and all I got was a run around. Sending a picture is not going to do anything! Disappointed. Don't waste your time!
1.0,"****06/01/2018 Update*****<br />It is almost 2 months since I originally posted this.  I still have no refund, they have their dress, I have made multiple attempts through email and amazon claims to receive my money.<br />I have received multiple excuses...we are checking on it...it is a holiday...still checking kn it....<br />My favorites are, remove your Amazon claim to get a refund...<br />And the grand daddy of them all came last night...remove your rating of our product and we will refund your money!!!!<br /><br />I normally wear a 3/4 and ordered a sizebigger than my measurements. Got the versions of a 5/6,it was too small. Couldn't even for my hips even though their measuring chart said it should have been larger than what I needed.<br />Retired it, purchased a size 8, now according to their chart it should be big enough to need a seamstress to take it in.  I received the second dress. Same problem, the hips.  So, I decided to take it to a local formal seamstress. Their measured the internal measurements of the dress, hips, waist, and top. Not one measurement fit the description on the chart. And the hip size was 2 inches smaller than the waist size. Not good.<br />I requested a return, that is not a free return. I have been given an address for SuZhou which is international shipping. And I must pay the return fees.  Not good business.  Beautiful dress if your hips are smaller than your waist.<br />Fyi, I'm 5'4 110lbs, and my measurements are 32-25-34 3/4<br />FYI- shipping from Florida was $97.00, not worth the return trying to get reimbursed for shipping and my dress!"
1.0,Runs small this item is for a petite woman
1.0,It's. Not like in the picture it not true to size at all
1.0,"This is a nice looking and durable feeling watch ,however I returned it for a couple reasons. The first is the luminous markers were extremely dim. I did the 15 minute closet test viewing the watch in the dark after my eyes adjusted. This did not make a difference. They appeared to be old. It seems with all the watch makers that use tritium, it is hit or miss with their quality control. The second thing and reason for a one star review is it lost three minutes of time in roughly 11 hours. I know this watch is not an omega but at $500 it should keep better time. I ended up returning the watch. As usual Amazon was great with the return. Mind you I had both these problems within 24 hours of having the watch."
1.0,"I am a vegetarian, and loved the look of the leather, but didn't actually want to buy a leather band for ethical reasons. So when I saw &#34;Faux leather&#34; in the description, I got my hopes up. Reading on, the listing also mentions &#34;PU Leather&#34; (which is part PU and part leather, so definitely not vegetarian). There is a PU material that is vegetarian and does look like leather, so hoping that they got those two confused, I reached out and confirmed with their customer service that the material was in fact faux leather. Only for the straps to arrive with a &#34;genuine leather&#34; stamp on them. Hmmmm...<br /><br />I went ahead and assumed the above stamp was incorrect as it felt rather flimsy (fake leather often is), but upon trying to get the band onto the frame I discovered one half of it was the wrong size and too big to fit into the frame. I even tried to put it into my original fitbit blaze frame, and it was still too big. There was no way to push it in, due to the difference in size.<br /><br />Like I said, I really wanted to love it, as I wanted this look for the watch, but in the end the product was unusable and I had to return it to Amazon."
1.0,"Started pilling the first time worn. By the end of the day, there was pilling where in the back area. I assume it‚Äôs from wearing the backpack over it."
1.0,THESE ARE FAKE HUNTER BOOTS. I purchased them and within a year they cracked and split. Hunter will not honor their 2-year warranty because this is a 3rd party unauthorized seller. Amazon was unwilling to help me or make this right.
1.0,"UPDATE: ok so i may have underestimated the staying power of the smell! I hand washed 2x's and the smell is as strong as it ever was!! (I have thrown everything trying to get rid of it to no avail!! Actually it is so bad my laundry room is now horrendously smelly!! Sadly i have no choice but to send them back!! So I ordered 2 of these, one in black, one in Gray. I would say pleasantly surprised, they both had a pretty strong odor? So they went straight to washing, the fit is how I had hoped it would be, they probably run just a little small? 3/4 sleeve is my favorite shirt and they aren't always easy to find and for the price u really cant beat it."
1.0,I love the picture.. fits in the arm upper thigh.. back are very loose but hip fit.. very thin.. fur isn‚Äôt All around like I seen on pics.. very thin.. I could offer this thin material at the store down the block for 20 bucks maybe less. More like a fall jacket not winter.. or spring jacket.. shop around before buying this jacket.
1.0,EXTREMELY SHORT! Do not order unless ordering for  a child. I ordered a medium and gave it to my 11 year old sister who it almost didn't even fit.
1.0,Clasp would not close once it was open returned and purchased better quality watch
1.0,It is just not a good style. The neck should be looser. The pockets just look odd. Not attra
1.0,"How can we put it on a key chain? There‚Äôs a real hook on it, it cut me"
1.0,I didn‚Äôt like it and returned it. Different type of material and runs a little big
1.0,low quality. disappointed overall.
1.0,Very little pieces not what I  Thought
1.0,This bra is horrible in every way I could imagine.
1.0,"Took forever to get it, and it broke the first day I wore it."
1.0,"Looks too gaudy and cheap. But not enough for the style. Perfect for decorating a favorite doll, Teddy bear, Christmas tree."
1.0,These are smaller than they appear so pay attention Two sizing before purchasing if you‚Äôre looking for larger earrings. Also the gems look very cloudy and cheap.
1.0,Not fleece it's nylon
1.0,Way to small!  Would fit on a baby's head!
1.0,Hat was way too small. Clothes were too big. Very cheaply made. Just not good quality at all. Returned it.
1.0,This is way too big for a small. Sending it back. I ordered a small and it's huge on top. Too bad because it's super cute.
1.0,Horrible quality. They ripped as we were putting them on. Strings for hood came out during use. Only a 1 star because no stars was not an option.
1.0,Their Small is really an Extra Large in actual size.
1.0,"I really wanted to love these leggings, however I have been wearing them for 10 minutes and there is already a hole in the middle of the leg area, not near any seams. Also the rise is very low in the back which is slightly annoying."
1.0,"I‚Äôm confused, it says this item runs small but it‚Äôs huge for my 6 month old. I got the 70 ( suggested size for 6-9 months) and she will not be able to wear this until she‚Äôs 5 years old. I could wear it as a shirt if it didn‚Äôt have the zipper. I‚Äôm very disappointed and the seller would only refund me if i paid to send it back which would cost me more than the outfit."
1.0,Had to send them back the smell when i opened the package was horrible
1.0,"This thing is so worthless!,I bought one for my husband for Christmas, and it did not work at all. It did not stay fasten, i was disappointed."
1.0,Order huge and hope you‚Äôre tiny.
1.0,Package arrived damaged.  Pajamas are not as advertised- very thin and the edge pieces were ripped off.  Size was large then normal too.
1.0,"El estampado y tela muy baja calidad, el art√≠culo no es como lo describen, de verdad que esperaba la talla fuera de buen tama√±o como la calidad de tela. La entrega no fue buena la bolsa venia rasgada."
1.0,"Wore one time and had irritation on both of my ears. I have never had an issue, (despite wearing cheap earrings most of my life!)"
1.0,Waste of money. It looks faded and has none of the definition that gives the 3D effect suggested in picture.
1.0,Uncomfortable fit however the color is good.
1.0,Fabric sucks looks cheap nothing like the pictures
1.0,Too long to be flattering unless yoh wear 5 inch heels. The sequins and material aren't a quality that you can do alterations. Not recommended.
1.0,Disappointed in the quality
1.0,Did not collect my item.
1.0,Fits a bit larg. Fabric feels very cheap
1.0,Ped√≠ talla mediana y me lleg√≥ uno con el tama√±o de alguien XL. Lo peor es que la etiqueta dice M.
1.0,"When this arrived, we were pleasantly surprised at the appearance and weight of this piece. However, there were no instructions included in the box. We decided to just try it out. Unfortunately, in the few days since it has been worn, we've realized that the second hand goes WAY too fast, throwing off the time-keeping, and the watch will, occasionally, stop working at all. So, it looks nice and feels nice, but it is, effectively, a big bracelet. Not happy."
1.0,"Flimsy like a t-shirt. Unfortunately,  not worth your time if you are looking for anything resembling support."
1.0,I received the wrong boot. Instead of a combat leather boot I received a faux suede over the knee flat boot
1.0,Poor quality. Seams don't match up.
1.0,It was very poor fabric and not at all what I expected.  Might be ok in house but not as outside coat.  Returning it is complicated so out the money.
1.0,"Although I ordered 2 sizes larger than normal, these pants were too small. The quality was also not what I expected & they didn't look like the picture at all. I will be returning them."
1.0,Poorly made. Shirt had stain on it. Smelled funny so disappointed and too big!
1.0,Earrings were tarnished badly when received. Item returned fir a full refund
1.0,"The sizing chart for this bra is incredibly wrong. When purchasing, I sized up just to be on the safe side, and yet when it did finally arrive it was so small I couldn't even get the bra on. This was really upsetting as it is a very aesthetically pleasing bra and would have been perfect for my workouts/yoga. Instead, I am now having to return the bra and look elsewhere for a better fit and more comfort."
1.0,So disappointed as I had high hopes for this bra.  I‚Äôm a 36D and this gave no support.
1.0,"This picture shows the mess after the first wash. The string was wrapped around other clothes in the washing machine with it, so I had to untangle everything from it. However, this is the only one of the five that did it. The others washed and dried just fine. So hopefully it was a fluke, because these fit me great and are very comfortable.<br /><br />Update: a month later I just threw a pair away because they became so stretched out that they were actually falling down!"
1.0,"Hola buen d√≠a!!! Muy bonito el estilo, pero no funciona!!ü•∫ no encendi√≥ ni nadaüò≠"
1.0,Not long enough for me and gems pop out easily
1.0,Color was nowhere near the same shade... color was more orange than red.
1.0,Way to loose on my head .....slid down constantly
1.0,I purchased these masks because of the breathing valve so that my glasses wouldn't fog up.  It didn't work my glasses still fogged up and they had a horrible rubber smell.
1.0,Too small and quality was poor.
1.0,"It sits sideways on my face right out of the box.  Thought something was clearly wrong so i sat them on a flat table, they are so uneven you can rock them!  The right earpiece sits a quarter inch off the table when sitting flat."
1.0,Fits in the waist but it‚Äôs made very weird and not made for a human
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!!!! Very thin material, see through and nothing like the picture at all. No support in the top and elastic band around the bottoms. Not made for swimming at all."
1.0,These pair has blood stains on the underwear
1.0,Super cute but won't stay in place
1.0,"I am 5'2&#34;, 140, usually in a med or large, size 8 in the US. I ordered an X-large and it fits like a shirt. I am more than disappointed and angry about it. I was looking forward to wearing this for an event but...For what it's worth, material is fine, not thin at all, and color and design just as pictures. It's just not made for an adult woman. A 6-8 year old will be benefitting from this crappy company, from whom I will NEVER buy another item."
1.0,"I'm a size Large, but I read reviews that this shirt ran very small so I bought a XXL. It is still very small. The XXL fit's like a Medium."
1.0,"While the U.S. Marine Corps is in fact a department of the U.S. Navy, they are most assuredly a completely separate service. The anchor is most definitely a symbol of the Navy, not the Marines. That is why you‚Äôd never catch a Marine wearing anything with an anchor on it, other than the ‚Äúeagle, globe and anchor.‚Äù Any Marine would be embarrassed to have their father wear this."
1.0,The fabric is such low quality on this that my bra shown right through it.
1.0,These look nothing like they do in the pictures. The blue one especially is really awful. The beads are just plain blue with ugly brown spots on them. Very disappointed.
1.0,The colors and patterns received were nothing like the ones displayed in the pictures
1.0,The ‚Äúneck hole‚Äù is weirdly small.  Not sure how they expect a person to put the bathing suit on.
1.0,Jacket came with a hole on the cuff of one of the sleeves.
1.0,The fit & material is bad -  made so many request for pick up but no one turned up
1.0,breaks very easily
1.0,Battery stopped working in way less than a year.
1.0,I was looking for a cami that would hold up my boobs and this one flattened them out like all other slimming cami's.  I have tried a lot of them I need a good one!
1.0,Delivered damaged and very sharp edge..un-wearable.
1.0,I saw this and was seriously going to order one in every color but Medium is way too small
1.0,"Like the title says, thin and cheap. üôÉ"
1.0,"The color of the shirt is more neon than pastel. The material feels durable and comfortable. The neckline is too small, it‚Äôs uncomfortable. The flower sizes are unflattering. I will be returning."
1.0,"They look great on, however give me a headache because the lens are not clear to see out of. Very much foggy to see. I wore them not even 5 minutes before I had to take them off due to brain ache"
1.0,"This is very bad √≠dem , don‚Äôt buy it the price is to high for the plastic item , nothing to do with seller describe .. don‚Äôt buy it you‚Äôll be disappointed"
1.0,"they sent me the wrong size ring so I had to rush out and buy another gift to replace this one , smh what a waste of money this was"
1.0,"I would not recommend this product unless you enjoy defective products.  This watch winder stopped working after two years.  Now, two years may seem like a long time compared to other reviews here.  However, for the $99 I spent in 2013, it seems like a complete sham.  I'd likely go to Tourneau or another high-end watch retailer and ask for their recommendation."
1.0,"Absolutely LOVE the band, but it started to discolor after the first week of wearing it."
1.0,The strap broke within two weeks.
1.0,One of the ribs already busted out of the seam. Do not purchase. Spend the extra dough for a nice one that won't be broken after less than 48hrs use.
1.0,Very cheap.. don't bother
1.0,"I know they were only 10.00, but being all scratched up on delivery was extremely disappointing.  Not even worth the time and aggravation to send them back, right in the garbage. The need to send them in something  other than a flimsy plastic bag. Rant over. Feel better, on with my day."
1.0,This product is beautifully made but clearly isn't what was written in discription......Size: One Size Fits For Most People With Stretchy Adjustable Ear Loops ....this has bands that go behind your head just like an N95 mask would not on your ears!!  Very disappointed ....
1.0,"If I could leave less stars I would. Do not buy this, extremely cheaply made, maybe you could wear it to bed. Idk doesn't look like the picture"
1.0,"Giving outfit to my 9 year old to play dress up . It was cheap for a reason , quality is poor, not like the picture, overall save your money. This is not it"
1.0,Only had this 6 months and it broke!! Waste of money!!Attempted to contact the Company. Left a phone message and nobody even bothered to return my call. So much for product support
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy these. I understand they are $30 but I at least expected them to look better up close. The quality is horrible.. the stones around the center sapphire are cheaply set in and barely sparkle. The metal isn‚Äôt symmetrical all the way around.  If you nobody looks closely at them then they are fine.
1.0,Very cheap quality. Metal was tarnished upon opening the packaging.
1.0,"Looks cheap, I had to return it"
1.0,"This is garbage please do not buy, the material is itchy and definitely nothing like the pic"
1.0,I ordered this one because I prefer the belt like closure the one I received has buttons. Let down for sure but too much of a hassle to return maybe I can donate it?
1.0,I'll be careful next time
1.0,"Very cheaply made product, was not even close to fitting in my nose. Would not recommend."
1.0,"This sweater is one size.<br />Usually I wear medium size,<br />I think this is x-small"
1.0,"I have thick athletic calves, and these fit just like regular socks with zero compression. I threw out the packaging so I don't think I can return them but would if I could. The height is also awkward as it hits mid-knee (I am 5'4). Not the quality I expected from this brand."
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt what was described. Jewelry box value
1.0,"Returned this product.  Not cute or flattering at all.  Cheap fabric, strange smell, very ugly dress."
1.0,It's ok for the price I paid but not happy with them what so ever
1.0,The clasps are cheap and break...do not buy
1.0,"It was, as usual , too large, I bought that a long time ago and couldn't reach anybody to return it.  I gave it away to someone who was heavy and it fit her.  It was like an extra=large and I wear an extra small or small - depending on the manufacturer.<br />China is no longer a place to order from."
1.0,"Really really really cheap crappy sunglasses.  These look really nice in the picture, but are garbage in person.  They came in record time, but the ear pieces are all bent and there isn't any wire in them like real Wayfarers have so you can adjust them.  I personally would buy a different cheap version of the Wayfarer if I were to buy some again.  I probably won't even wear these due to them being crooked on my face since they are bent."
1.0,it's a plastic watch - I'm serious a plastic watch
1.0,"So disappointed, this bracelet fell apart the first time I put it on."
1.0,"I bought this in a 2X, because the description says true to size. That is a bald face lie. This lil thing fits like a US Lg or XL, but it is NOT a US 2X."
1.0,The ankle chain was already broken upon delivery/ defective. Poor quality shoe.
1.0,I purchased this dress in white. The material was see-through. Very disappointing.
1.0,This strap came unglued just from the sweat on my wrist after a couple of days.
1.0,I ordered a brown top and was sent a red one. The material is very thin and the top is not flattering.
1.0,"This is not metal, like it appears.  It is plastic, and arrived as a scratched up plastic at that!"
1.0,0 value
1.0,This top looks SO much better on the model than on me.  The cut was too tight around waist and abdomen and was too lose from shoulder to shoulder.  Had to return this.  But refund was very prompt.  No hassles.
1.0,"You should show it being worn , unable to tell how it wound look would be great"
1.0,Very cheap plastic appearance and too large for my taste.
1.0,I really wanted the hat in the image but the hat I received was nothing like the hat in the image provided. I'm very disappointed but luckily the hat is  a similar color and fits well so I would  rather keep it than go through the hassle of trying to return.....
1.0,These are not worth the $50 that I paid for them. I wanted gloves to wear running. They don‚Äôt keep my hands warm. The coldest temperatures I run in is about 35 degrees.
1.0,"This is simply a liner.....no padding to it!!! It did not add any volume whatsoever. Worn under a head scarf....the only thing it did was make it hotter!! Should have returned it, but dealing with so much right now."
1.0,"I bought a small, i usually wear a medium and it was so big another of me could have fitted in there. I'm 5'1 and 128lbs."
1.0,The scarf I thought was 100% silk has a label that says ‚Äú100% silk feeling polyester‚Äù
1.0,These earrings are so much smaller than what I thought they'd be. More suited for an infant versus a pre-teen.
1.0,I can't find a single pair of sunglasses this fits on. I purchased a different brand instead and am much happier. I gave these away to some poor sap who'll find out for himself how these won't work.
1.0,"Too small, If I had to guess I would say Child L. Way too snall."
1.0,Both zippers stopped working on 2nd time trying to wear these. The buckles are flimsy and barely sewn so using them isn‚Äôt an option. Now they are trash.
1.0,"I was stoked when I received the band. It feels really nice and solid, and each link is actually 5 separate pieces so the band wraps around your wrist like it's a part of it and feels really comfortable. Thing felt like a dream.<br /><br />Unfortunately the 2nd night I wore the band on my watch, one of the non-adjustable links fell apart and sent my watch flying off my wrist onto the ground scraping my watch face on the pavement. Some of the small pieces I was unable to find, so I can't even fix it =\<br /><br />Shame, because it feels like a quality product. I might have just gotten a bad apple.<br /><br />Edit: And just incase it comes up. The issue was on a non-adjustable linkage on the watch band. The linkages that I adjusted with are completely intact (I know how to drive a pin securely)"
1.0,Came damaged and had to return
1.0,"Ordered a 40 size waist, what came wasnt even a 32 size waist. Runs extremely small, and i wouldnt reccomend it for anyone tall because the leg length is under 30. The largest size is an XL. Waiste of time and money."
1.0,"It looked like a good buy,It is made of some cheap polyester material, it fell down my face because I have a small face, and it just looks Ridiculous!<br /> don‚Äôt waste your money"
1.0,"If you are more than a few months pregnant, don't bother.  This shirt is too short to cover a prego belly.  Thankfully I just wanted something fun for Halloween but I will have to wear a shirt underneath to keep my prego belly from showing."
1.0,"It‚Äôs soft and the color is pretty, but this is not Sherpa. I‚Äôll be sending it back."
1.0,"It‚Äôs a cute suit, however the panty portion was all loose- I‚Äôm tempted to try the smaller size but debating because I‚Äôm big breasted and the top might be to tight"
1.0,Horrible it broke the first time I went to put it on
1.0,Do not order from this company!!! I ordered 3 different sizes and only received 1 full set of 4.  Only received 1 of another size and didnt receive one of the sizes at all.  I was also given the wrong tracking information for one of the items as it went to another customer in a different state.  These are also very cheaply made and dont stay on very well.
1.0,Completly see through. I even sized up.
1.0,"If you enjoy being stressed and being hassled, these are the people you would like to deal with. I cannot believe how much trouble this has been for me during Christmas. Was very excited to receive this dress, but come to find out it runs large. Try to send it back, but was told I had to pay to send it back. Kept asking me to keep it and they would give me a little off for my travels. All I wanted was a prepaid label to send it back.."
1.0,"Does not stick enough to do it‚Äôs intended job, so I ended up cutting the lift floppy thing"
1.0,"Weird left handed zipper, doesn't get warm, doesn't fit at all."
1.0,Great product in theory but the battery died after a few days use. I appreciate that they include extra batteries but it's pointless if they only last a few days.
1.0,not what i expected runs small  TOO SMAAALLLL
1.0,This is a bra that does not support you at allTo me it‚Äôs very cheap and it down support and I need to return it
1.0,It is really really small for me
1.0,"These leggings ripped the first time I put them on.  The sellers should say that these are meant for sizes 00-6.  These do not have stretch to them so if you are not these sizes, do NOT buy!"
1.0,"I recieved a product with a smooth spandex stretch which is not the fabric that was displayed however I'm not surprised at this. I know it is a cheap imitation. I'm not surprised at the sizing either since I listened to the other customers and ordered a size up. I'm glad that I did. Because as a 12W or an XL, the XXL I bought just barely fit. The XXXL would have been more comfortable but its slippery nature means it would slip down and probably fall off if I lose just five more pounds.<br /><br />What I am surprised and disappointed at is that I received a pair of pants that had torn fabric, burst stitching and a gaping hole in the leg. This is the first time I received a clothing item from Amazon that flat up was destroyed before I even could try it on.<br /><br />If you are willing to tolerate a possible defective product for $16.00, go ahead and buy it if you don't mind having to repair it."
1.0,You have a nice warm pajama bottom and a very thin pajama top. They don‚Äôt match up for warmth.
1.0,Purchased them online.  And this is the only way they can sell them for the price they are.<br /><br />I have been in a jam before and have bought $5 sun glasses... Johnny shades are no different.<br /><br />The packaging is top shelf but the glasses are kid size super light cheap frames.<br /><br />I never even walked outside with them on to check out the lenses.<br /><br />I tried them on and laughed at how small and cheap they are. I put them back into the packaging.<br /><br />Oh... and you only have 7 days to return them. I flew out of town the day after I got them so the 7 days was past when I returned from my work trip.<br /><br />Total Rip off!!!! Do not waste your money
1.0,These were cheap looking and feeling. I probably should have surmised that from the price. Went straight to the give-away pile.
1.0,They fell apart to fast for the price I paid for them.. wouldn't recommend them.
1.0,No good quality. Within 3 week it broken. And also the delivery took like a month.
1.0,these are junk
1.0,"Wasn't a big fan:/ this shirt liked nothing like it was advertised. The product had very little shaping,  waist was super short, chest too big (I'm a DD!) Almost like a square peeve of material had arm and neck holes cut. The chest cris cross then didn't lie where it should.  Wasn't worth a size change unfortunately."
1.0,The bottoms did not fit well. This is not made for curves. The front was very bulky and saggy! The top fits well however the rob does not have loops for the belt. The bow or ribbon fell off. Just not a good buy especially if you have butt and no tummy.
1.0,"very cheaply made. charms are good, but the plastic that the wrap is made from is cheap and had a horrible odor.  i ended up cutting the charms off and putting them on a homemade bandanna bracelet."
1.0,This photo does not represent the item received which look like cheap dime store stones - not even a cheap rhinestone look.  These are going back and I'll avoid this brand in the future.  They probably would make a 10 year old happy for dress up - for $3.
1.0,"Terrible. Off center outer disc dislodges easily, doesn't rotate well, Looks cheap too."
1.0,"I ordered it for myself. It looked loose and larger. However, when I tried it on it fit close to my head. I am going to give it to my granddaughter for Christmas.  I found another brand that said it was larger fitting, so I bought two in different colors. I hope they fit better."
1.0,I‚Äôm like to buying one of those dress
1.0,"Looks good, no idea why it is so small."
1.0,Fake not Pandora
1.0,"Very cheap, thin shiny material ( ordered the black). Fit was ok, true to size but very cheap looking"
1.0,i must sayÔºåthis thing is not goodÔºåit's very small and hard to wear it onÔºÅSo plz think about this when u  buy itÔºÅ  And„ÄÅi paid for the one-day delivery but it came in like a week‚Ä¶
1.0,"Nice soft fabric,but the fit and support is horrible, get rid of this item."
1.0,"Nothing like the picture and sizes are all wrong. I'm 5'3&#34; (120lbs) size M and bought the medium. It is not oversized at all. Doesn't even go past my waist  and sleeves stop at my elbows at most. I looked like a shriveled up flying squirrel when I put it on. If you want to waste your money anyway, order at least 3+ sizes up and hope you don't get a potato sack look."
1.0,"To small, no size acurrate."
1.0,Too small to fit the Flex 2 band
1.0,What a letdown! I should have made sure the exact measure my specifics! These would only fit into toddler ears! They weren't expensive- so I call it my own mistake-but doesn't have to be yours !
1.0,"Mask is complete junk, looks nothing like the picture, cheap thin latex, poor paint apps, hair is haphazardly applied barely passable for my lawn decor mannequin. If I could rate it zero stars I would."
1.0,WAYYYYYYYY too small.  Not even close to true to size.
1.0,I got this product yesterday on 9/16 and got to wear it for half a day before it broke. Im very disappointed..
1.0,Got this thinking yasssss. It was a total disappointment im now going to have it altered and redesigned. Sigh
1.0,"Don't waist your money on these shorts. Of the three, only one pair are true to size. All three were different sizes, and the ones that were actually true to size roll up constantly. Not comfortable at all! Would have given no stars if it were an option."
1.0,Didn't have it even a full two weeks and the thing is falling apart!
1.0,Do not buy this as the clasp is very hard to lock and unlock. It came off the second time I tried to put it on. Total waste
1.0,Do not purchase!
1.0,I put these on thinking I was going to go to the gym. Looked in the mirror and long behold you could see everything because they are see through!
1.0,"Watch has multiple links removed, a push button is bent and it's all beat up!"
1.0,Very cheap. I returned.
1.0,Way too hard and stiff. Strap too thin for weight of slipper.
1.0,I wear a 6 and ordered an 8.  It's still very tight on me
1.0,"There is a reason there is not a detailed photo of this patch. Namely, it's a ripoff, a knock off, a whatever you what to call it. It looks nothing like the screen used patches as they claim. I have two theories on this. One, they are so incompetent that they are unable to see the patch on the series. even someone who has only seen part of the show could tell it's completely wrong, let alone a true fan of the series! My second theory I think, is the more likely culprit. Most likely this seller does NOT have permission from MGM to distribute their copyright protected visual or intellectual property. If they were at all even similarly made as the real deal, MGM could sue them into squishes on the pavement. This particular seller is highly misleading. When I got this item for my son he was so excited he lit up like a Christmas tree. He has been watching the entire Stargate franchise with me his ENTIRE life. Literally. He's eleven. When the package arrived he was so happy he was almost floating. He took one brief glance at it and his little face crumbled in front of me. I asked him ""What's wrong sweetheart?"" He handed me the P O S patch and replied ""Does it look like there's something wrong with this, or is it me? This doesn't look like the patch Jack O'Neill and the others have."" I took one look at it and saw that not only was it a total fake, it was a crappy fake. The only this they got right was the symbol for Earth. the stars are in the wrong place an the planet behind the gate symbol could have been from somewhere the team went on the show but, it is DEFINITELY not earth. However, smart move on them, the patch was inexpensive and therefore not really worth the effort to return the P O S. So way to go you (Insert an long , imaginative, multiple curse words or phrases strung together here) you gave my 11-year-old the proverbial piece of coal in his stocking, even though he is a great kid. Amazon should Really take a closer look at your SHADY, underhanded, immoral, and just plain unethical and outright lying business practices. sorry I couldn't get to your review sooner but, I'm not really one to leave a lot of reviews... however, LUCKY YOU, I found time in my busy schedule to give you a review worthy of the item you sent me. By the way you don't deserve the one star I gave you but, you can't post a review without one."
1.0,I had to give the shirt to my 11 yr old Niece. :(
1.0,"After losing a pair of Oakley sunglasses when doing the ""Nestle plunge"" in the Gulf of Mexico (it's a good idea to listen to your wife when she says, leave the glasses behind), I purchased these wayfarer shades because I needed a pair I would not stress about.  In the photos you can see how the hinge is detached from the frame and how soon after they came apart altogether.  I'm being sent a replacement pair, but I have no idea what condition they will be in.  I'm not stressing as they are not expensive, but I hope the new pair is at least wearable."
1.0,"Broke less than a week. The buyer was very quick to respond and give me refund. I wish it would‚Äôve last, but I‚Äôm scared to get another one don‚Äôt want to take a chance on it and loose my watch .."
1.0,I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law.  It is not soft nor is it a heavier sweatshirt.
1.0,Absolute junk. Do not buy the gold. I wore 1 time and the color faded to Brown yuck.  I'm very disappointed. I would've returned but I already bad thrown the packaging away so I just threw the anklet away.  Total waste of money.
1.0,"Very unsatisfied, does not clip into place and causes the actual watch to fall off, I will be returning."
1.0,I gave this shirt as a 60th birthday gift last night. As soon as he pulled it from the bag a button fell to the floor. He still loved it so wore it missing a button. A bit later he reached for something and the side seam fell apart.  I would like it replaced.
1.0,"came in a timely manner, but the stone was out of the necklace and the bracelet was broken.  Had to repair both before giving as a gift to granddaughter."
1.0,"Very fragile in quality, it bent so easily there was no way I could keep it without it constantly reshaping itself."
1.0,I got this for my ex son in law. He sucks just like Philadelphia.
1.0,"My teenage daughter and I loved this necklace when it arrived and we wore it frequently. However, within a few weeks it started to turn black. We ended up throwing it away within a month of purchasing it, which was very disappointing because we loved the style and length."
1.0,"I did not like this dress. Even after going up a size, it did not fit properly. It was not good material. It was too thin and looked nothing like the photo."
1.0,First time I wore it the ball on the end came off.  Was unable to wear because it was constantly scratching me.
1.0,not size as said
1.0,Love it but it does not like me:(
1.0,Too cheap and thin see through  pants and te top is for a bab65
1.0,This is not the shirt you will get if you order. The description says 100% cotton and clearly shows a dress polo with a cuffed sleeve collar and a logo on the chest. The shirt that came was a dry fit Nike golf shirt the sleeves were not cuffed and there was no logo on the chest it was also 100% polyester and they sent the wrong size so buyer beware.
1.0,Too loose and made me look frumpy!
1.0,Terrible. I bought red arrived orange. It is not the model of the photo. misleading advertising. the size S is a huge size like XL.Terrible.The dress does not look like the one in the photo. I bought a ridiculous dress different from what you announced. I wanted a red dress and an orange dress arrived with different designs. the difference is clear. The dress is not the model of the photo. the fabric is horrible and does not have a trim like the one in the photo. I hated the dress.
1.0,Product was not the same as the pictures showed. It shows the retro logo for the sharks but I ended up getting a modern logo hat. Very disappointed.
1.0,Just noticed I never received these. However I did receive a different set of hinged nose ring hoops & had a massive issue getting it to close then open up again to get it out. My husband ended up having to use wire snips to clip it out of my nose. I do not recommend hinge clasp style rings for sensitive areas.
1.0,"Material of belt is way too flimsy and the belt makes the dress, sorry"
1.0,Bought a size smaller still to big
1.0,The charms dont glow in the dark
1.0,Crap! Broke in 2 weeks.
1.0,"This wallet is no smaller than a traditional wallet, and the picture showing it next to another wallet is totally fabricated. The only difference with this one is that it leaves your cash flapping around in the middle so that it gets in the way of the cards. 0 stars."
1.0,"don't machine wash them because they are Very delicate. hand washing is 100% recommended. also, remove the pads in the bra, they Will either fall out or get a tad damaged. the rubber strings in it where popping out everywhere. it's a good starter bra if you have small boobs but not very durable. they're good for if you're in the house and not doing much. i really don't recommend them. if i could give them 0 stars, i would."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:fdebf85969dd610781a306064f8dfe21]] There is pain I am getting in the middle of feet while walking l. The sandal fit me but perfect but I  do not know why it is paining while walking. I do not get pain with normal sandal. My conclusion is that with more use this sandal change shape and deform. I had to stop using this sandal after 55 days. So I will not suggest anyone this product for durability.
1.0,Not very good was way to big and hard to hide under my daughters prom dress!
1.0,"This ring runs very small.  I would return it, but I think the hassle is not worth it."
1.0,"If possible I'd leave it at 0 stars. I've been a long-time Amazon customer and by now I should know better than to order a product disregarding the reviews.<br />1. Horrible quality. There is no label on the product but my guess is it's 95% acrylic and maaaaybe a 5% cotton.<br />2. I washed it as I do with all new clothing items, particulalry with a newborn in the house, and this crap came apart. See photo.<br />3. It's way shorter than what the picture depicts. It's a one-size-fits-all, except for me. At 5'10&#34; this would reach mid-way through my buttocks.<br />4. I tried to return it when I saw that the size is off and the great customer service suggested I give it as a gift to someone. I disregarded the email and a couple days later they approved my return saying that the shipping charge would be deducted out of the reinbursement. Now, knowing that this willbe shipped to friggin' China I feared that I'll end up paying extra just to have it returned. Plus, again, I have a 2-week-old at home and the last thing I need is to deal with a return. So I'll file the $25 under 2015 loss. Could have been worse.<br /><br />If I get at least one person to think twice before ordering this, I'll be satisfied."
1.0,"The picture is disappointing. Thought this would have looked more custom. Instead it is stretchy, shiny like a sports wicking material shirt. It is actually 65%cotton/35% polyester NOT what description show!  It looks like one printed shirt vs. The bleach looking custom and unique. Size I would have gotten a Large but thought it might run small base on sizing and reviews so got size bigger. Due to material I received it is to big. Very disappointed!!"
1.0,"This item looks nothing like the picture. It was about three sizes smaller than expected and it looks like garbage. It‚Äôs made of very cheap, bright blue yarn. Not dark blue as the picture shows but bright, bright blue with white throughout. It‚Äôs hideous. Complete scam. They should be banned from Amazon."
1.0,Very cheap. Claps are a maginet and come apart easily. Returned this item
1.0,Lenses are not tented as advertised
1.0,Flimsy thin hoodies runs very small<br />WACK JUICE
1.0,I purchased the masks and had them delivered to my disabled and hearing impaired sister.  She tried them by asking people to put them on.  The masks stuck to the wearers' lips making it uncomfortable and difficult to speak.  The wearers would not continue to wear the mask.  A major disappointment for my sister whom I haven't seen since the beginning of the pandemic as she cannot understand or hear me while I wear a mask.
1.0,"Returned, it was see through."
1.0,"Ordered XL. These are tagged XL, but at best are medium."
1.0,Very cheaply made started coming apart at the seams first time wearing.
1.0,DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY NOT WORTH A WOODEN NICKEL. Bought as a gift for my husband and he put it on within 20 minutes the fingers fell off. He was only driving no wind no physical activity just a cheap product
1.0,"When separating the earring from the back magnet, the magnet attached to the &#34;diamond&#34; came off."
1.0,Sucks! Do not buy.. Broke as I was putting them on.
1.0,"Typical crap from China!!  Way to small, bad quality"
1.0,Really small. You can barely fit anything in it.
1.0,Runs  2 sizes small
1.0,"Cheap and terrible fitting, itchy! Was not expecting anything amazing but At least hoping it would last more than one wear. Not even worth keeping to  wear for Halloween"
1.0,Too mall
1.0,Way to small.  More like a large than a 2X
1.0,"The sleeves are super uncomfortable and elastic digs into your arms....unless you have really small arms, i can't see this shirt being comfortable for anyone....it is poor design when the rest of shirt is baggy and would be comfortable....this one went back..."
1.0,Sizing on this suit was way off. I'm a 14 and bought a xxl and was too small.<br />Fabric was pretty cheap.
1.0,"I was happy when I got these until, after washing several times, I had black dye all over my legs.  They turn my white undergarments black.  VERY disappointed!!!"
1.0,These screw together.  It is so hard to do.
1.0,These are children's sunglasses and are soooo cheaply made its not even funny.. Please don't waste your time!!.
1.0,cheaply made. clasp broke as I was trying to pull it over my head for the first time.
1.0,"First one arrived with an obvious hole in it. It also is not flannel as stated in the description, it is a thin polyester, which does make it super soft which is a plus. Don‚Äôt feel it was worth $30, but it‚Äôs what my daughter picked out for her sister."
1.0,Very small size and poor quality. Uncomfortable to wear and feel apart in a few weeks. Would not recommend. Just do yourself a favor and pay $20 more for a quality brand.
1.0,Quality is really cheap and it looks dyed or more less
1.0,Not only did it turn my finger a different color but it is really small. Horrible fake ring. It barely fits any finger and it turned my finger green. I am extremely unhappy. Now stop blowing up my email unless you plan on giving me a refund for your product.
1.0,These are the most uncomfortable slippers I have ever put on. Not only were they smaller and narrower than offered but inside material was cheap and bunched up. Clarks used to be good quality but these are just awful!
1.0,Super late shipping. I messaged seller about specifics on shipping and got a generic automated answer back.<br />The shirt is poor quality. The side holes for nursing are completely open. I ordered an XL when I normally fit a large. Hoping to have some room and be comfy. The XL fits like a small!  Not happy.
1.0,"I'm very unhappy,I put these pants on and the back of the pants has several holes.please get back too me."
1.0,It fits my 7 year old daughter perfectly....
1.0,"Zero starts, this thing snapped the first time we tried to use it. Definitely not worth the money or the time to return it. Very disappointing."
1.0,This should have lasted at least a year. I've always been a totes fan but this one was disappointing.
1.0,The picture looks nothing like what I got.  One fabric is different from the other and it looks poorly printed and that I actually returned it and they told me just to keep it.  Don't buy it at all it's not worth the little you'll spend on it.
1.0,"It isn't blue, it is gray.  And the back and arms are a totally different pattern.<br />What a waste of time, now I have to go to the store to return this horrible and ugly shirt."
1.0,"I'm not sure how this tunic / dress has all the positive reviews.  It's GIGANTIC.  My husbands wears a mans 2XL TALL and it would be big ON HIM.  It's also a heavier weight material than I was expecting it to be.  I was hoping for a light flowy t-shirt material and instead got a knit that had a ton of weight to it.  This will be returned.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5‚Äô4 ~ 145# ~ 34B bust 28‚Äù waist 34‚Äù and ordered this in crimson/  Medium. I normally wear a size 8 in bottoms or a M in tops.<br />I paid full price for this item and wasn't compensated in any way but would appreciate a &#34;yes&#34; click if you found my review helpful :)"
1.0,I bought it teo sizes to big thinking it would fit great. And yet it feels like a small
1.0,Title says it all.  These socks (apparently size 10-13) are too small for my size 11.5 feet and are so thin that they are see through.  They look like nylons on my feet.
1.0,"Doesn't look like picture, color is off and it isn't like a rope chain, very light and poor quality, priced too high as well, looks like something you would get at the dollar store."
1.0,"My daughter had worn these shoes less than a week when this picture was taken. For $29.99, I expect much better quality. My son has paw patrol shoes that I got at walmart for $12.99 and he has been wearing them for a month. They still look brand new. Ridiculous."
1.0,Received this dress and  pulled it out of the package and it completely smelled of BO..... I thought this dress was supposed to be new? I was honestly sick by the smell it was that bad. Suffice it to say I was very disappointed with this purchase. Not because of the dress itself which was cute. Just sending something as new with the smell the dress had is bad in itself.
1.0,It was too small and it does not close tightly
1.0,"Perhaps I received a defective item but after I set this up, the entire right side was tilted to the right. Additionally, the rods didn't screw in all the way thereby not allowing the removable bars to lie properly. I'm hoping I can try to fix it myself before trashing it."
1.0,"This is a glorified muumuu...you have to work too hard to make it cute, presentable at best. Save your money."
1.0,The underneth of this shoe is wayyyy to smooth. I almost slip and fall. It is made in all swade material.
1.0,"I'm 5' 8"" - These are 2 inches too short"
1.0,Did not like them. So small you could not see them to good
1.0,We bought the largest size for bigger feet but the still didn‚Äôt fit.
1.0,Does not fit 2013 Toiring models as claimed.
1.0,"Different, but masculine.  I bought this as a gift for my brother who loved it.  He loved it so much he showed it to his girlfriend, who bought  him one that was similar  but more expensive."
1.0,Horrible quality and sizing is way off i ordered the size for an 11-12 yr old and it looks like it will fit my 6 yr old maybe
1.0,Would NOT recommend. Tarnished after ONE wear.
1.0,I had to return this dress. It looked nothing like the image suggests. It was way above the knees- it was so very short.
1.0,The anti-fog does not work.  Save your money
1.0,It is nothing like the photo. It is not soft or comfortable. The color is the only thing I like about it.
1.0,It seemed like good watch but it lost an hour twice the first week. I returned it. Another complaint was it was had to see at night.
1.0,"These are the wrong size, they're just as big as my 7/16!!!!!!!"
1.0,Stitched very poorly. Will not be wearing
1.0,Clasp for earring is off center from the tassels below. Cannot wear. Returning. Disappointed. Pic included.
1.0,Worked for about a week and then just stops or doesn‚Äôt keep time correctly.
1.0,Wayyyyyy too small!!!  Both top and bottom.
1.0,Although cute and cheap it already broke. I'm pretty handy so I'm  thinking i will just fix it. But also took FOREVER TO COME.
1.0,These masks do not fit well and do not stay in place.  They are also very hot to waer.
1.0,Very flimsy plastic broke within a week
1.0,hangs like a garbage bag; and I did check the size chart before ordering my size.
1.0,one of the earings claps did not work
1.0,Unhappy with the shirt. Ripped shirt
1.0,"Purchased this for my sister who lost her son.  Charm is very nice, but broke after one month. Since, she was attached for sentimental reasons, I ordered another one.  It also broke after one month. I will not be buying another one!"
1.0,I love this sweatshirt so much but it came with a bunch of stains all over it. I wish I could wear it but unfortunately I can‚Äôt
1.0,"Compr√© este pantal√≥n para pijama, pero me sali√≥ 100% Poliester, en la foto no se aprecia que es Poliester 100%, totalmente decepcionada, no lo devuelvo porque me cuesta dinero el env√≠o que debe de ser mediante una compa√±√≠a de env√≠o como FEDEX por ejemplo, es lamentable."
1.0,This shirt was NOTHING like how it looked in the picture nor was it how the description portrayed it. It could fit my daughter who is 10 but the sleeves were incredibly long even for an adult.
1.0,Don't waste your money on this product. Doesn't even look good.
1.0,This is the most God awful piece of garbage I've ever seen. Its made out of scuba foam.  Don't purchase this item it is a complete waste of money. I can't wait to return it for a full refund.
1.0,Not qood quality!!
1.0,I ordered this as a gift for my neice! I was super excited as this was something she was really wanting. I find out the strap broke less than three days later and unable to fix. Extremely disappointed!!!!
1.0,This is not a genuine stone.  It has air bubbles.  I believe it to be plastic.  Pretty but not worth it.
1.0,Runs small and top is see through. Might as well be wearing transparent plastic. Material is thin and cheap. Too bad because the stock photos make it look like a nice top.
1.0,Color was much brighter than pictured. Incredibly ill fitting and cheap looking. Returned immediately
1.0,Received broken and previously opened
1.0,"They are so uncomfortable! The feel heavy and I can barely grip dishes. The silicone scrubbers barely get anything off dishes, and the food isn‚Äôt even stuck on. These are awful"
1.0,"These earrings do appear as depicted. They are about 1/2 an inch long, and the rhinestones sparkle against the copper-ish color to give them a lovely appearance.<br /><br />They came in a simple box, which held a thin layer of dark foam in the bottom. The earrings, however, were not connected to this layer and lay free. The front of the box was also smudged with black spots.  I'm hoping this was a review packaging because it definitely gives a cheap impression. There was also a 'free' bracelet/hair-tie thingy included as well as a wet-wipe.<br /><br />While one earring was in good condition, the other was bent halfway down the stub at about a 10-15% angle (damaged before packaging), which is not only disappointing but makes it difficult to slide the backing on. Again, this gave a very cheap impression and ruined any joy I might have had with them. The pair comes with two backings‚Äîone matching the earrings, the other the usual clear rubber. They fit snug (ignoring the damaged one) and will keep the earrings from accidentally falling off during wear. They are cute, but simply aren't in good condition."
1.0,"Keep in mind that a larger size doesn't mean that make this longer. Too short  to wear as a dress, too long to wear as a top."
1.0,Horrible! Dress was way too small!
1.0,If I could give zero stars I would it‚Äôs not true to size and does not stretch at all. Do not order this item
1.0,Arrived BROKEN.
1.0,Not curly fluffy like listing pic. It's literally a bath robe without the loops and belt. Not something to wear out. Shape isn't flattering. Returning and ordering a bomber instead.
1.0,"Love this shorts this is the second pair I bought same size but these are way to big! WTF, same company, same shorts, had to give these away"
1.0,Way to big and heavy for a watch
1.0,"Aren't watches supposed to tell the correct time once it's wound up and times set. Well, NOT THIS ONE. It's got a mind of its own!"
1.0,"I returned the product. The Cap itself was cheap, the service patch which was ironed on, was coming off when I received the item and was crooked. The crown became creased during shipping."
1.0,For Avery skinny person
1.0,It‚Äôs not long in the back. I was hoping for it to be longer to cover my neck from the sun as shown in the advertising pictures.
1.0,Very strange sock shape and fabric. Returned immediately because they didn‚Äôt even look comfortable!
1.0,This glasses did not transition from indoor to sunny outdoor. I was really looking forward to it but I am greatly disappointed. So sad
1.0,didn't last even 4 months. started to tear apart
1.0,"It's beautiful and my daughter loved it. Pity the clasp broke within an hour of her having it on. Since she's an adult, it's not as if she slammed it against something. One moment it was on her wrist, the next it was not. Because this was purchased through Amazon the return is easy, but still, it puts a damper on Christmas when one of your presents falls apart before you've worn it for ninety minutes."
1.0,Cute but definitely plastic. Very cheap.
1.0,Doesn't fit my husband
1.0,Don't purchase very cheap
1.0,The top part is only rose gold. The actual ring is gold plated.
1.0,"The first time my grandson put on the coat, the zipper was broke."
1.0,These are very uncomfortable. They didn‚Äôt work at allX
1.0,The anklet broke almost as soon as I opened the package.
1.0,I ordered the largest size and I still couldn't get it past my thighs. They are cute and all but I kinda wish they were bigger
1.0,"una porquer√≠a, muy barreta"
1.0,The beautiful earring never stayed screwed.
1.0,This product is horrible ! Worn three times and tarnished ! No water contact or anything like that ! Do not purchase !
1.0,[[VIDEOID:db112d2ee8f82d4bdcb17b1af0dc073e]] not what I expected this thing is so small so tiny it look like it will break in less than a week and when I say small I mean it is small not what I expected and it‚Äôs not even a Soldered together so you have to be careful that you don‚Äôt lose the Charm!
1.0,Hard to get on....had to cut off.
1.0,"I bought this dress and was super excited to wear it this weekend. I guess I should've known with no reviews that it would be bad. And let me tell you, whatever you think about this dress the reality is 10x worse. The 4xl was closer to an XL. 10/10 DO NOT BUY."
1.0,You can't get these things on the ear pieces.  I returned them.
1.0,Not the best material.  Reminds me of a  costume.
1.0,"Returning dress, material  too thin & clingy"
1.0,Mask did not fit my daughter's face and it didn't even have a string to hold it up.  Cannot return. Or replace. Waste of money
1.0,it will fall apart after a couple of washes
1.0,Turned my finger green within 20 minutes
1.0,"Way too small. I am a size 0-2 or XS and these were too tiny. Also, the seam down the crotch gives a very defined camel toe that I've never experienced in a pair of underwear."
1.0,ALERT !!!!!<br />DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!<br />The size does not fit.... I ordered a 5x... but it fit like a small.. The tag even said 5x. So it fits way small.  The print on the leg looks cheap. LIKE IT WAS PASTE ON THE CUT OUT. And the pants are see through. Ok so not to hate on this pant. So if you are small and I mean small and about 4&#34;11<br />these pants are for you.
1.0,This necklaces chain broke within a week of purchase and the necklace was very heavy. You could still use the necklace chain for novelty or something.
1.0,These glasses lenses were warped and distorts your vision. Clearly not 1st quality. First disappointment of my amazon purchases. :(
1.0,"The apron is horrible. It‚Äôs ugly; the material is hideous. Oh, they‚Äôre probably durable, and most definitely water resistant. But do you want to wear a rain slicker in your kitchen? And an ugly one at that? I almost cried when I opened the box!!!"
1.0,"This is so cute but unfortunately after the first day of weering it, the face of it fell off so it was a waste of money"
1.0,"The seams are very thick and stratchy, very uncomfortable for an undershirt."
1.0,"I bought this for a dear friend thinking the necklace would be decent quality considering the price, but I was wrong. The first clue to return it should have been the packaging. The incredibly cheap pendent and chain came in a small plastic baggy that one would think came out of a gumball machine.<br /><br />The card was great. The words on the card were so nice and fitting, I went ahead and took the chance in gifting it.<br /><br />2 days later, my friend sent me a message telling me about the rash she got from wearing the necklace for 1 day.<br /><br />This is the most disappointing buy I have ever made on Amazon. I hope this review spares others from spending this much money on something like this, when there are better quality items within the same price range."
1.0,The gloves fit great. They do not keep my fingers warm. Suppose to work in freezing weather. The touch screen feature does not work. Had to take my gloves off to work my cell phone. Very disappointing.
1.0,"I was very excited when I purchased this dress, however when I came it was awful simply awful I returned it immediately. Where it looks like the fabric kind of hangs over it‚Äôs just a very flimsy Spandex waist band where I suppose you‚Äôre supposed to pull it up so it looks like the dress hangs over a bit, incredibly tacky, no way on gods green earth would I ever keep this product it just looked incredibly cheap."
1.0,Looks very cheap . Going to return asap.
1.0,It broke very disappointed. May have been defective
1.0,i wore these shoes for the first time  today the little rectangle patterns are popping off.  horrible for what i paid i do not want these shoes if they are  falling apart on the first day of wear
1.0,Feels like plastic and does not glow.  The bag it came inn is nicer than the locket.  You can't open the locket without taking it off the chain.
1.0,"the ear cuff does not fit my ear, it's too small, and my ears are small, it's big, heavy and does not stay on your ear. Would not recommend wasting money on this one"
1.0,I.T came stained
1.0,Just downright cheap
1.0,Arrived broken. Wish they didn‚Äôt.
1.0,I want to return this ASAP! It‚Äôs a sloppy looking dress with zero material!!
1.0,The metal zipper teeth broke off and can no longer use this bag. I really wanted to like it but a waste of money now.
1.0,sits like a piece of cardboard on my head. I would've returned it but missed the deadline.
1.0,"This shirt was a piece of junk. It was an off brand tee. No image on front. Red, not burgundy. Writing on bottom of shirt was faulty. This is a product shipped from China, not authentic Southern Couture. They would only refund 20% of the purchase price since shipping back to China was too much $$. Go to the real Southern Couture website and buy shirt from there. Same price but will have to pay shipping."
1.0,"False advertising, these socks are impossible to get on even with a sock aid! Who wants to spend a half hour putting them on."
1.0,The loops are too small. My sunglasses have pretty fat temples. I have a few pairs of sunglasses I wear over my prescription sunglasses. It doesn‚Äôt fit any of them. This product is useless for me
1.0,Not clear why my review didn't go thru last time w/ picture as well.<br />Received wrong name - and apparently others have as well.  We receive the same name over and over.
1.0,"I ordered a large, so that it would be comfy. When it arrived, the label said large, but it was way too small to be a large. The sizing is way off. üò§"
1.0,"The material is horrible,  and to large,"
1.0,"Cheap plastic feel wore once and the thin fraying string they sent to lace it up got so tangled up... it‚Äôs just sitting my drawer... def got what I paid for, didn‚Äôt expect much... but it was only for one night..."
1.0,The top and bottoms do not match the top has grey Mickey‚Äôs the bottoms are black.... very disapointed
1.0,Fell apart the day I got it
1.0,These arrived two days ago and have the above rip after walking around my home in them. I‚Äôd like my money back or a new pair immediately
1.0,"The band fits on the watch fine, but the length of the band is a lot shorter than watch bands worn in the past. It may have stated in the product description what the length was, but how about manufacturers get back to using standards that have been in place for decades? One star because I am growing tired of this trend."
1.0,I ordered the circles and received hearts. Much much much smaller than picture.
1.0,Sent 2 left handed gloves
1.0,"There is no way this is a 3X! I could barely get it on and I normally wear a 1X or 2X. My daughter, who normally wears a medium tried on the shirt and it barely fit her! She now has a new shirt."
1.0,I live in Spokane WA. I tried these socks. I was very disappointed in this product.  They did not keep my feet from freezing .
1.0,"Looks good, but broke within one day."
1.0,"Well.here goes, when I opened the box I really liked the weight of the band and that it included 2 screwdrivers and a band replacement tool. Unfortunately the factory screws to secure the face to the bands that come with the Garmin Fenix 3 HR did not fit through the holes of this band are too small!! Have to return!"
1.0,Horrible make only two of the backings actually had the hole in them
1.0,"Only paid $6 or so, but still"
1.0,"Cheap silicone band. Started cracking the second time I wore it. Also, it said it would fit a 38mm Apple Watch, but the part that attaches to the band is wider than the watch."
1.0,"Listen, please take my word for it this item is a total waste of your hard earned money.<br />I'm a little bit older past 66, my stomach is some what extended. I wanted some extra help<br />holding in said stomach, as we were about to leave for vacation I ordered this product,<br />it fit me like a T-Shirt. I felt no tension no elasticity in the least. What a disappointment,<br />obviously I'm going to request a refund. I don't usually get disappointed when I put in an order<br />through Amazon a very safe place to shop online by the way. Does anyone know what the procedure<br />is for returning an unwanted, non-performing garment?"
1.0,Sizing is incorrect and even when you get the right size they do not stay on feet for more than a minute. So frustrating and a waste of money!
1.0,"They just fall down like there‚Äôs no elastic in them, and they‚Äôre uncomfortable and lumpy on the bottoms inside shoes. I just felt icky and wearing them!"
1.0,"my bottom set ripped right in half when I was applying them, very flimsy, do not recommend."
1.0,They don‚Äôt stay on. They bunch up in my shoes.
1.0,"ordered a women's large, might fit my 8 year old granddaughter..."
1.0,"The arms are WAY TOO SHORT. I am 5‚Äô7,130lbs and ordered a medium. It is definitely not as advertised. The sleeves are not proportional to the sweater it‚Äôs definitely not the same as the photo. I am greatly disappointed in spending my hard earned money on this."
1.0,The dress itself is nice. The problem is the big flower falls directly over my wife's breast and looks very awkward as a result. I'm sure it would be good if she just ended up with a different one due to the cut of the fabric. I'd exchange it if possible.
1.0,"The white coloring looks off, not off-white, but just off.  It looks dirty when placing it on my white shirt.  It looks like white looseleaf paper."
1.0,"Looks like I may have received a jacket & battery that was not from ‚ÄúPROSmart‚Äù, but from a skim company posing as the true company! Bought same jacket from another vendor and the battery has a cover but yet this one does not!"
1.0,I found the leather to be slightly acceptable but the latch that closes the bag to be impossible to close without the latch or clip that locks the bag falling off. I would not purchase or recommend anyone else purchase until problems with the design are corrected.
1.0,Homemade scrub set strings everywhere loose stitching. I'm canceling my other orders this should be labeled jankey sets....sides are jersey material?????
1.0,I order 8 inch but I see when I receive it try it on very tight around the rest<br />üò°
1.0,"Me llegonincompleto, solo me mandaron 10 de 50, dijeron q me mandarian el resto y tofavia estoy esperando...no vale la pena la espera porque de tidas maneras hay q comprar mascarillas para protegernos del virus...realmente estoy muy inc√≥moda por este pedido."
1.0,broke shortly after purchasing. Cheap and cheaply made.
1.0,I bought these gloves specifically because they were supposed to be waterproof - not water resistant- waterproof. Well they are not waterproof...not even close. I wore them to a football game and it was raining. They soaked through before halftime.<br />Having said that i would rate these gloves much higher if the add was not completely wrong about claiming waterproof. They arre comfortable and warm - until they get a little rain on them- they they are 10 pounds of material.
1.0,"Too small, can‚Äôt get it on"
1.0,"I bought this watch at the end of January. The price was over a hundred dollars, so I expected a quality product. It worked for two months, then it quit. I was wearing it all day, but it stopped running. I wound it with the crown knob, and it started working again ... for two days.<br />I contacted the seller and got no response.<br />Don't waste your money on this watch unless you want a pretty watch that doesn't work."
1.0,"the small seed bead bracelet broke and shot beads all over during first attempt to place on a 6 1/2 inch wrist. my wrist/hand was not too big, the bracelets were WAY TOO SMALL. most unsatisfactory."
1.0,"this bag is TINY! barely bigger than a large wallet, just be aware of the dimensions when purchasing. Other than it being small it is a pretty nice bag, great for a game day at the stadium, perfect size for a couple water bottles, keys, cell phone and small wallet. I think it is WAY TO EXPENSIVE for the size though"
1.0,"These are so cheap, they don‚Äôt even look good. The lens reminds me of those cheap 3-d glasses that don‚Äôt even fit in the frames so you‚Äôre left with bulging issues. Or a mirror that‚Äôs cheap and wonky. Took a picture so you can see how awful the reflection is skewed because it‚Äôs that flimsy."
1.0,Tuned a copper color after three days üëé
1.0,"The boot pictured is not the Morgan.  It is a picture of the ""Natalia"" boot.  Big surprise when you receive it an it's not like what is pictured in the ad.  Got a refund and eventually found that the Natalia is the boot that was wanted."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy unless you are looking for a thin, see through sweater that looks absolutely nothing like the picture. My daughter ordered two sizes bigger and it just barely fit. The color is Halloween orange not the nice color from the picture. No wonder the shipping was almost $20. It would be going right back if it wasn‚Äôt."
1.0,Do not buy. I searched  for sketchers and these popped up. They are so uncomfortable it doesn't even feel like a shoe. You could strap on a waffle iron it would probably feel more comfortable than these shoes.
1.0,Size is way off--I have broad shoulders and big arms.  XXL fit me well-this shirt in XXL is about a Large.  Material quality seems decent but if it does not fit--what does that matter.
1.0,"These are very poorly made , adjusters do not work . Do not buy not worth the price!!!!!!!"
1.0,Never got to wear them. Broke as soon as i tried to wear.
1.0,Dislike the product is cheap the plastic is very thin and the label you put on it stuck to it and there is no strap to keep it close poor quality for the money i payed not happy.üòû
1.0,"Material doesn‚Äôt stretch what so ever and barely fit over the girls, I‚Äôll give it to my daughter"
1.0,"I want to like these so much! Cute patterns, easy to fold and stash in my purse so they don't take up much room - unfortunately they tore at the seams the first time I unfolded them. Very disappointed."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:9f93c1c453358a8a264325ad81b7b06d]] as you can see‚Ä¶ the band is sticking out of my apple watch. unable to wear it- it‚Äôs beautiful but too big. what a shame :/ false advertising
1.0,Definitely not a buff like on survivor.. this is literally a piece if clothe cut out and dyed with the survivor logo.. very disappointing
1.0,I'm very disappointed with my hat. This is the first time I've been let down. First the bill is larger than a regular baseball cap then it must have been sewn on wrong because it sits more to  one side & when I put it on it looks crooked. I don't know if it's just this hat or all the Paris hats. I'm thinking about exchanging it for another. I hope they can do this since I'm in love with the PARIS design on it. :-(
1.0,"Very disappointed. I couldn't tell from the picture, but it's that waffley kind of fabric, which was not at all what I wanted. Immediately returned it."
1.0,I did not like the hat. It was defected when I received it. I sent it  back for a refund
1.0,"The description on Amazon clearly states that it is SPF50, but there is no tag inside the suit to verify that it is SPF50, and there is no information in the packing to verify that it is SPF50.  I do not trust that this suit is genuine SPF50 and returned it"
1.0,Did not come as described. They were supposed to be a mother daughter set and I only received the pair for a child and they are larger than I ordered. Extremely disappointed. I purchased them as a Christmas gift and now I have to find something different here locally.
1.0,Very very small. Not at all what I expected. This seems like a child's size.
1.0,"Horrible material.  Very uncomfortable. Purchased the purple also and it is perfect, so it may be just an issue with the black material."
1.0,"Wow. Way to go. Promote exclusion. Yeah; so the quote is from a movie. As Ted Cruz showed us, that doesn't necessarily make it cool. This is not. Why would anyone buy this? This is a sadly misguided attempt at chic. Once you have been or have a child who's been excluded or bullied, and I hope you aren't or don't, you'll see what a poor try at humor or wit this dunce cap is. Shame."
1.0,not so good which I expected from picture and  ...quality is very poor and brittle too...so dont like the pendant tassel choker
1.0,Not happy that for as much as I spent on them that the one shoes top bands are off centered and I can't wear them right. A defected pair of $40 shoes I can't wear.
1.0,"I bought this as one of my gifts for my Mother-In-Law for Christmas. I was so disappointed when it arrived. The neckline is incredibly low. So much so that she would have had to wear a camisole underneath. It is actually open to the waist. Also, extremely cheaply made. Returned. Do not recommend."
1.0,"Bought 2 of these for my 4-year-old twin girls for ballet class. Fit is very cute. They find them to be comfortable.<br /><br />However, one of the leotards fell apart with 10 minutes of wearing (not exaggerating). The skirt separated from the body of the leotard.<br /><br />Also, with both leotards, it should be noted that the shiny dots are actually STICKERS‚Äîthey are not printed on the fabric. They come off quite of bit during wear. It‚Äôs unfortunately just a very cheaply made garment.<br /><br />I would have returned these but ballet class starts too soon and we don‚Äôt have time to wait for a replacement."
1.0,I was so sad they were too small for me. My friend who is a size 4 fit her perfectly. So I gave it to her. I was really upset and extremely sad. Since when people who are size 4 Considered to be large people?!
1.0,"Cheaply made. Not roomy either. About the size of a women's medium. Pic showed blue, rec'd grey."
1.0,Beautiful dress. BUT the top part is way to small and the bottom half is real puffy. I am a size 12/14 bust size 38C.
1.0,The beanie fell apart and the masks design didn't doesn't cover my face enough.
1.0,This product is substandard. I wouldn‚Äôt take it even if it was free.
1.0,"Este producto es de la peor calidad, no me dur√≥ dos d√≠as, se rompieron y las tuve que votar,"
1.0,Pants are not true to size. Couldnt even get them on. Couldnt return them but got partial credit from Amazon. Gave them away
1.0,The picture shows different sizes and the bags have all the same size and they are too small. Totally waste of money.
1.0,not right size i ordered size 4x the sleeves look like it fit someone who wear a 1x
1.0,"Colors are dirty, will never wear it, total waste"
1.0,Arrived wet and smelled like mold. Will return
1.0,Gloves did not go as far as I thought they would and they were too small for my hands
1.0,Half have defects on either lenses or frames. Will be unable to use these for store. Waste of $$$$
1.0,not  great at all  looks better in the picture
1.0,"I got my ""new"" set today and the tags were already cut off. No major signs of wear and tear other than that, but if I am buying a ""new"" item, it shouldn't be one that someone has worn and returned. I sent the sellers a message, so hopefully, this can be resolved."
1.0,To tight not for big bones
1.0,Not good.  Don't recommend
1.0,IT is made of poor quality and cut very short.  I am 5'5 and the bottom were at my ankle.  I sent it back.
1.0,"Perfect colors,  not true to fit"
1.0,It last 3 weeks working
1.0,The feathers on the earrings were different sizes. Obviously can't wear lopsided earrings. I'm returning them.
1.0,It looks a touch above a quarter machine kids ring. It's bent and the &#34;opal&#34;  doesn't look good . Shipping costs more than the ring. Don't waste your time....
1.0,These pants look NOTHING like the photo!. The pattern wasn't centered on the pants and looked ridiculous! I cant believe they are trying to pass these off as real clothing! I normally don't write reviews but I had to warn other customers!
1.0,It's ok at best.  Used it once and strap seam is coming apartüòî
1.0,"If I could give this zero stars I would. The magnet isn‚Äôt even strong enough to hold the two sides together between a piece of cotton T-shirt, let alone skin."
1.0,"I was really excited about this top to wear for spring and summer. It would look cute with jeans and shorts. However, once I received the shirt I found that there was no shape, the underarms gaped from my body. Overall the fit on this shirt was terrible. I'm not a person who has to wear things skin tight but I'm not going to wear something baggy either. I will be returning this item."
1.0,"The design goes all the way through the fabric, making the inside of the shirt slightly sticky, and the cotton used is uncomfortable. Nearly $30 for this shirt is a rip-off, despite the cool sleeve design."
1.0,It was not user friendly to set up
1.0,Wanted to love this necklace but it arrived broken.
1.0,The material is so itchy but it's cute
1.0,Way smaller than I figured it fit like a nylon over my head and almost as sheer
1.0,Ordered 20‚Äù and received 12‚Äù. Not real gold and not even close to the true rose gold color. It‚Äôs dark like copper. The photo shows a REAL rose gold chain compared to this cheap knock off.
1.0,"I purchased two pairs of socks, a pair of copper infused compression socks and this Wanderlust air travel compression socks making my decision based on all the positive reviews. I  wore the copper socks and they were like a miracle, I had swelling and pain in my leg  after my last flight that was not going away as it usually does, it could be because I sit at my desk for long hours. I wore the copper infused compression socks for a week and changed to the Wanderlust compression socks and all my pain came back with in the first few hours. Happy I tested them first before flying with them, I am disappointed."
1.0,Shotty quality. Broke in one week.
1.0,IMPOSSIBLE to put gemstone back into ring.
1.0,"Chest too loose, hips too tight! Jacket okay but not the important part"
1.0,I got this a little over a month ago and I just noticed a stone is missing. They will not exchange for me. Do not order .
1.0,They were poor quality.  I returned them. After one washing.  Very pilly
1.0,Too large and material very thin
1.0,"I have my lip pierced on the side, about half a cm from the corner of my lip and I cannot get this through! There is no way this would fit a labret piercing. I was so disappointed. The post is extremely thick and too short."
1.0,"Too small :( it's a quality product but the MEDIUM is more like a size 8, not 10-12"
1.0,These arm sleeve are junk the stitching or thread keeps coming apart
1.0,"Bought my daughter this band for Christmas and it broke the first day. Thought it was a fluke and since she loved it, I bought her a second one. The second last one month before it broke as well. They both detached from the piece that slides into the watch. Since these are the only bands she‚Äôs had break in this manner in 4 years of wearing Apple watches, I‚Äôm going to assume it due to poor quality."
1.0,Sleeves are way too tight and chest area is too small
1.0,I did.Not what it look lie
1.0,I‚Äôm so disappointed to say this bracelet broke after less than 3 months of wearing.  I messaged the company and got no reply.  Very disappointed.
1.0,I didn‚Äôt like the way the ‚Äúdress‚Äù part floated up in the pool
1.0,Stones fell out at soon as I pulled them out of packaging
1.0,This is not a gemstone. It's clearly made from glass.
1.0,Is the ruffle suppose to be shorter in the back!
1.0,Stitching made it extremely uncomfortable. No way this can be worn
1.0,This thing is made for a little girl.
1.0,"I bought two colors of this set in the same size (large) and they fit drastically differently. The pink and white striped set is a true large and fits. The shorts of the blue hearts pattern one are more like a size extra small, despite being labeled as a large. Here‚Äôs a photo of the two size large shorts side by side and you can see the difference."
1.0,The picture was misleading. I thought the bones logo was part of the hat. It's really just a clutch pin on a really cheap hat. So I basically paid for a pin.
1.0,"I am very disappointed in the shirt. It looked like a very nice, classy, dress shirt but it is very thin and see through. I'm returning it."
1.0,"I wore this for ONE day to work and the left strap broke (its hooked on with a cheap plastic ring) and while I was trying to fix it with a paper clip so I could keep working, the right strap broke on the other end (without the plastic ring) so there was literally no way to fix it. I got home and threw it in the trash. This dress is cute in theory, but the slip part of it is kind of bunched and doesn't lay flat so it makes the dress look funny and cheap."
1.0,Terrible should have returned but was not worth the trip
1.0,"Misspelled labeling, half-etched eagle, what is shown is not what arrived. I don't know why it has so many glowing reviews - mine didn't even get ""Federation"" spelled correctly. Absolute trash."
1.0,"I gave it 1 star because it is actually a shirt. What a complete piece of garbage! Horrible material, seams missewn and untrimmed. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE"
1.0,"It‚Äôs super cute, but as I was driving my glasses fell right in my lap because of of the plastic  hinges broke and the clip fell apart.<br /><br />Update: the seller sent me another and the piece that clips to the sun visor broke. Overall not a good product. Save your money."
1.0,These sunglasses are terrible. They seem great at 1st but they have a metal nose piece. Which means if they are left in any hot area and then you put them on your face you will burn your face! I have nose burns now. I can not wear my reading glasses. I can not wear any other sun glasses. I need it to heal before I wear anything else again. Again DO NOT BUY THEM!
1.0,Poor quality for the price. Beads appear much larger on-line.
1.0,"Disappointed.<br />Dress material is gorgeous. Doesn't fit. Can't even put it on... let alone zip it.<br />Almost two sizes smaller than the seller's size chart. Sizing is way off.<br />Really like the colors, material, and style... unfortunately, I have to return it. Sucks."
1.0,Loved the look but they broke as soon as she put them on such a bummer bc very cute earings!
1.0,"Comfortable but not made well, the fit on the top is very low cut and did not provide adequate chest coverage. Buttons on the shirt fell off shortly after washing a couple times. The shorts were too tight."
1.0,I assumed this would be metal since they called it silver and black. It should have been called gray and black. It is super cheap light weight plastic. They've raised the price several dollars in the few days since I bought it at $5. I wouldn't have paid anything for it if I'd seen it in person.
1.0,Used for calves not thighs for which I purchased for because they didn‚Äôt fit
1.0,"I almost broke my neck - these are super thin and supper slippery on wood floors.  I wear socks and slipper socks all the time and have never come close to slipping.  Took a few steps with these and my feet actually slid out from under me - bruised my tail bone, skinned up my elbow and feel like I have whiplash.  Run away from this product (barefoot)"
1.0,Overall good but the brace that holds the belt broke the first day.
1.0,"I am 6'5&#34; and I ordered this specifically from Amazon because I was looking on an XL. The belt loops are at nipple level, and the robe wears like a mini skirt. To top it off, the material is very thin, scratchy and uncomfortable."
1.0,I purchased these specifically for the green pair in set number 1.... of course that pair arrives broken. I have opened two others and another pair is falling apart as well.
1.0,The purple lenses are so light there's almost no tint. Cheap plastic that fits horribly.  There's no adjustment in the face area at all and no padding around the back.  To uncomfortable to use for just a Halloween costume. Huge disappointment.
1.0,This top is horrible! The open sleeve is too wide and makes the top look sloppy! The design on the front looks cheap! Don't waist your money on this top!
1.0,Terrible purchase!<br />I gave to friend who is a size 6. I‚Äôm a size 24! Total rip off!
1.0,"I order a size up for a relaxed fit, still the elastic waist band pulled the shorts too high."
1.0,Way too small.. I have a 38 inch waist but belt is more for 34 inch or smaller. Product ID very cheaply made.. stitching was crooked. I don't recommend at all
1.0,To long so they have to wait have g them on quality god but to long
1.0,I couldn't read the print at all. I bought them as part of a gift and left them out altogether. Cheaply done. I'm using  them to dust with which is why I felt I should give it at least one star.
1.0,I love the fit but upset that what they shipped them in and no return!
1.0,Altough a small it runs big<br />The straps are Missing  so large and strapless is not a good combination
1.0,I got these Wednesday. Yesterday was Friday and a stone fell out already. Also the back kept skidding off the post. Definetly disappointed.
1.0,I am extremely disappointed with this manufacturer and the product delivered. The watch that was delivered is EXTREMELY low quality and the color of the wrist band is very different from the dark brown in the image. I do not recommend buying products from this seller.
1.0,Stopped working shortly after we received it.  Company refused to give refund or even an replacement watch!  Watch out for this one.
1.0,This is the worst piece of crap I have ever received from Amazon! This shirt was no better than an old T-shirt used to clean toilets with!  The fabric is so thin that you can probably read thru it.  It arrived stiff and was the worst quality possible.
1.0,Byer beware there are no options for returns and the order dosent show up in your history you have to hunt for it
1.0,Cheap made product
1.0,This item came apart after wearing it one time
1.0,The sole came apart after only wearing them 2 times
1.0,"I ordered a small and received a medium, it‚Äôs wayyy too big so I‚Äôll be returning unfortunately. The shirt is super cute, just wish they would of sent the right size!"
1.0,Very cheap. The earrings broke the second time I wore them and the necklace broke the third time I wore it. I initially bought it for my wedding. Looks great in pictures but don't expect to be able to wear it more than a couple of times
1.0,Does not lay upon the ear. Disappointed.
1.0,"Very cheap material, it‚Äôs not worth the money. It wasn‚Äôt well made, did have a tag or something that can show the brand or it wasn‚Äôt being used."
1.0,Horriffic
1.0,Too silky does not look like picture..cheap and they are not socks but stockings....uncomfortable to wear
1.0,"This purchase was so WTF. I ordered the Michael Kors python bag, but I got a cheap pink bag that looked nothing like the item pictured here."
1.0,"This is literally the cheapest item I‚Äôve come across so far. These are less than dollar store quality gloves with a tiny heating pad that has to be plugged in AT ALL TIMES to work.  How is someone suppose to do anything with these in when you have to be plugged in all the time?  It says to take out the heating pad to wash gloves‚Ä¶ soon as I took out the heating pad, the gloves started unraveling.  This is just a disgrace that a company would sell something so‚Ä¶‚Ä¶BLAH"
1.0,"Bought three, threw away three, the material was lighter than paper, never again will I buy shirts through Amazon"
1.0,These all cracked the minute the went in the dishwasher. Poor quality.
1.0,Very pretty. But was too small! 26 plus size won't work...Returned.
1.0,This dress is horribly thin.  I returned it immediately.
1.0,Muy contenta pero dise q son 3 y nada m√°s llego una
1.0,REALLY TOO SMALL BASED ON MEASUREMENT
1.0,i will not wear  it
1.0,Bought a large and it was a small with an L on it.

1.0,This was suppose to be my sons halloween mask.....it comes in the mail today ( with halloween a week away) and the plastic mask is cracked !!!!!! Not happy!!!
1.0,Not at all like description. Cheap material
1.0,"To say I‚Äôm disappointed is an understatement. These ripped literally the first time I wore them, and it‚Äôs not like I was doing any amount of physical activity to cause this. Complete waste of money."
1.0,Big ugly square piece of cloth. Purchase if you‚Äôre shaped like a refrigerator and not a human with curves.
1.0,"If these weren't so cheaply made I would be happy. My last pair I had to sew up after wearing just a few times. Hopefully I didn't just support child labor, because my 7year old can see better than this!"
1.0,I am returning it it's cheap it's small it's awful do not get it.
1.0,This hoodie was VERY POOR quality. The material was not sweatshirt material and it wasn‚Äôt nylon either. I ordered a small and got a medium - which was still too small. It looked like a child medium. It‚Äôs going back!
1.0,It was misshapen and smelled terrible.
1.0,Was nothing like photo. Not denim. Very wide but very short unlike the pictur
1.0,"I'm not sure how the dress fit. There was no zipper or give to the fabric, so it couldn't even be tried on. It's nothing like the picture. It's very cheap, very thin, and really ugly. It's so poorly designed and made."
1.0,Not as pictured. Material is thin and doesn't fit according to size. Returned.
1.0,"Returned, was very disappointed with the quality of this dress."
1.0,Expensive- sent it back and bought a less expensive brand
1.0,broke after 2 days use. Didn't even drop them 1 time and they cracked right in the middle.
1.0,Runs very small!! Will give away!!!!! Too much hassle to send back!!!!!
1.0,I wait long time and new said your itme my be lost it
1.0,"I bought the blouse because l had red pants to match and was so excited, until the item was delivered. It was too tight and too small. I ordered an XL, which is my normal size, and l couldn‚Äôt pull the shirt down! I thought about sending it back but just decided that l wouldn‚Äôt be  ordering anything from this brand again!"
1.0,"Too small, sending back"
1.0,Not even close to the size
1.0,One ball had a dent in it and the stud of the other earring was bent. I'm trying to return these.
1.0,Shoes didn‚Äôt feel good at all. Return process was not smooth. I had to pay for shipping them back.
1.0,Much smaller than the picture :(
1.0,"It was broken when it arrived! Even if it had arrived in good condition, this minuscule stand barely holds a wallet. We needed it for a purse. Pictures can be deceiving, even when measurements are provided. It has to do with design and functionality"
1.0,dont put it in the wash.. the coloring comes off and ruined my other clothes
1.0,Gave as a gift do not  know if she is happy with them
1.0,Fit larger than advertised.  Returned and didn‚Äôt reorder. Product had a strong chemical smell and would have been too long for my torso as well.
1.0,"I loved the size & style of the earrings, BUT ONE OF THE POSTS FELL OUT AFTER LESS THAN A MONTH."
1.0,This says one size fits all so I thought it was a plus.  Could not even button it!  I would definitely buy this again if it were in a plus.
1.0,Too small and I even ordered up! Very disappointed
1.0,"Too strong and too painful, not meant for upper or lower areas"
1.0,this dress was no where near a maxi dress like picture or description. im 5'5 and its middle ways between my knee and ankle and the cut at bottom at hem is crooked
1.0,"I wore this a whole 2 shifts before it broke apart in a very dramatic fashion. I mean, even the reel inside the holder came out like an old cassette tape ribbon. Such a bummer as I was proud to be supporting the cause."
1.0,"I bought these for my husband to wear while plowing snow on aa tractor. First snowstorm that he wore them, came back in and said they are not waterproof at all."
1.0,there made of realy cheap plastic will break after wearing them once or twice I bought three pair all the same the side broke off had to throw them away
1.0,Turned my ears green without coming into contact with water
1.0,Top and bottom are two different colors! Top was made of navy fabric and the bottom was black with white dots. Garbage!
1.0,The description states that there are 2 light strings and battery packs. The package only includes 1 light string and battery pack.
1.0,When it arrived it was not even a terminator mask. Just a grey skull. Contacted seller and did not acknowledge mistake after substantial time awaiting a reply.
1.0,My watchband was delivered on Sunday about 10 o‚Äôclock I only wore it Monday to now and this is the way it looks. I am disgusted with the quality even though it was very nice in the picture it‚Äôs not the same.
1.0,"Cheap crap, no elasticity. Does not fit head"
1.0,Nice design. Ok material. Great fit.<br /><br />BUT it shrank to a kid size after the very first wash. I don‚Äôt know it was the cold wash or the dryer that shrank it. But I couldn‚Äôt wear it again and had to donate it.
1.0,The boots fell apart within a month of my son wearing them.
1.0,No cushioning on bottom of slipper. Very uncomfortable
1.0,Awful - cheaply made. Worse than poor quality. Hook broke first time it was opened. Not worth 10 cents let alone 10 dollars. Shockingly bad item. Stay away!
1.0,I do not recommend this product.  It‚Äôs nothing like the picture. I wanted for my daughter‚Äôs sweet sixteen because it looked like it had Rhinestones but instead it has some sort of print.  Very disappointed!
1.0,Never received it.
1.0,The dress is VERY thin. The material is stiff and syretchy. The dress itself has an odd shape with hips built into the dress.  Returning. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I have owned 4 pavlok shock clock 2s now. I bought one in 2020, since then, mine broke after a few weeks, i got an RMA, that one broke within 3 weeks, next rma, who would‚Äôve guessed, zap function broken again. i received my last one covered under warranty, shock feature is already starting to go out. this would be such an incredible project if it lasted. the zap feature is the main selling point for it, but it seems to overload the pcb or something because it always goes out so fast. i fully charge, test etc. same thing with every single one. so it‚Äôs not just one bad batch of 4 have stopped working anymore, i‚Äôm not doing anything i shouldn‚Äôt. i just charge and put it on before bed so i can wake up."
1.0,"Total dissatisfaction, too small material feels so cheap"
1.0,Not the best quality--back broke off before I could even put them on.
1.0,Beautiful bracelet and was very excited when I received it. I wore it about 3 hours and it broke.
1.0,"This should not be sold as a &#34;compression&#34; tank. There is absolutely no compression in this fabric at all. It is also on the short side, as it doesn't hit my hips. The fabric is soft and stretchy, but also like a stretchy silk pillow instead of an athletic tank. I've gotten better quality tanks from Target or the department stores."
1.0,Now that the wedding is over I finally have time to write a review. The dress did not fit at all. It was the wrong size. The quality is very very much made in China crap. The seller refused to take it back. It is a mess. I wanted to look like a Disney princess but I was the beast I'm this thing.
1.0,if your neck is as small as a 5 years old child then this will work for you otherwise its a waste of money it doesn't even fit around your neck.
1.0,Worked fine for my partner that had a shaved head but with long straight hair I could not get the straps to stay on without slipping straight to my neck. I‚Äôve had other kinds of the non ear loops work just fine so it must be the material of the straps that is particularly slippery.
1.0,"These literally fell apart after one hour of use at a splash pad. My kid isn't a crazy climber or anything, The fabric pulled away from the sole and the insert separated, leaving my kid's foot covered in bits of disintegrating padding. It's a total bummer, the kid really loved them."
1.0,Charms fell off soon after wearing. Charms nowhere to be found.
1.0,They were too big for my taste<br />They are light weight and giftable if it‚Äôs the person‚Äôs taste
1.0,"Runs small, normally a 2x and ordered 2x and it was too short"
1.0,Couldn't get my toes into these.
1.0,my wallet has two sides and folds in the middle. Need an insert that folds sideways.  The picture is not indicative of the actual product which folds up and down----if this makes any sense...anyway returned for a quick refund.
1.0,The sizing listed was off.  It was way too small to wear.
1.0,Only fits ring size 5-6
1.0,They have the word &#34;Pimp&#34; printed on them.
1.0,The frames of these glasses virtually disintegrated less than a week after purchase.  I purchased two pair and they were both the same.  The plastic frames are so thin that the actually break when you take them off your face.
1.0,"The size fit way bigger, the fabric was very cheap, the print was not like what was pictured. This item was received 45 days after placing the order.  Company stinks with their return policy.  PLEASE do not order this cheap garbage!"
1.0,La tela muy transparente  y mala calidad no puedes ni ponerte ropa interior el color extremadamente brillante
1.0,I like the fell of the product but they didn't last more than a week
1.0,Very cheap looking. Do not buy.
1.0,First time I opened them up they broke!
1.0,These tights fit a loose plastic bag. Not cute.
1.0,The product size is smaller than the crocs you buy directly from croc or their outlets.
1.0,"I purchased as a gym bag, and it was a BIG mistake. I could give less than one star I would.  The bag is small and once you place anything in the bottom comparment you have less room.  The bag becomes oddly shaped and does not allow any additional room for items.  Once I place my towels, sneakers, under garments in the bag.  I do not have room for any additional items.  If you are like me, and carry a number of things to the gym such as work clothes and towels. This bag is not for you.  I highly recommend you keep looking!!"
1.0,"Super cute, but rough seems and not very durable.  Washed once inside out and nearly all of the graphic on the shirt washed off.  Not worth the money."
1.0,Item was way to small I normally wear a med but got a large womens it fits my 9 years oldüò°üò°
1.0,"Inserts do not attach to the bottom, therefore making them pointless."
1.0,"Great looking and comfortable! Wore it for a month and then it broke. I think screws came loose, but can‚Äôt find the pieces to fit together. I‚Äôd like to return it, but don‚Äôt see that option in my order information."
1.0,"It is not hollow, so you can't blow bubbles.  The product description is misleading.  Just a solid prop or costume  pipe."
1.0,Feels and sounds like walking in snow pants. These are a no. Returning. Also the waist band is stretchy but way to tight for comfort. They also sit above my belly button.
1.0,Cheap. You'd think you get $9 worth but noooo. The material feels like $2. Easy to lose. Don't get. Don't get! If you get you're gonna lose them. DOn't. No.. No... NOOOO!
1.0,This dress i purchased bcs it looked good on line and i thought it would've been a relax fit hack no i couldnt even get my arm  into the dress and it said 3x so sad i should had wrapped it up and given it as a gift to a new born baby girl
1.0,Cheaply made and didn't fit well.
1.0,The band started falling apart within a month
1.0,I buy unitards all the time. Normally they are great on amazon. This one has a hole in it.
1.0,Was never able to deploy it due to unreliable software and difficulty with both  the onboard storage and extremely small communications bandwidth. Would never buy another.
1.0,Straight garbage! Didn‚Äôt last a day
1.0,very thin and pattern stretches out as you wear it. It fades after first wash. I should have returned it. Waste of money.  Donated to goodwill after second wash. Booooo.
1.0,"It was the most strangely fitting suit, ever! I put it on, looked in the mirror and laughed, put the suit in the box and returned it!"
1.0,This is the worst product I‚Äôve seen. I threw it out. Your hair would never make it into cape. It would end up being a very messy job
1.0,Cheap material and turned my neck green
1.0,"Loose af. Doesn't stay up, hurts to walk in. Looks so low quality."
1.0,If you‚Äôre looking for a cute way to organize bows and headbands - this isn‚Äôt it. Do yourself a favor and get an over the door clear plastic shoe holder and use that instead. This material is so stretchy that it doesn‚Äôt keep the shape and it becomes a tangled mess.
1.0,This wig was horrible. The hair was frizzy and out of wack. Do not waste your money.
1.0,"I received a pair of these as a gift.  I wore them as my only pair of sunglasses for 6 months, including regular exercise outdoors.  After about a week, I began to notice dark splotches on the lenses.  Eventually I realized that this is the polarized coating wearing away.  It continued to happen until there is almost no polarization left, but the splotchy nature of the remaining coating causes eye strain when I wear them, so they are basically worthless to me now.<br /><br />I've never experienced this with a pair of polarized lenses before, so either these are really cheaply made, a defective pair, or I've been really lucky with other brands."
1.0,"I ordered this ‚Äúbaseball jersey"" in size XXXL. I like my sports jerseys a bit loose. As I unpacked it and held it up, I immediately could see the shoulders and chest were too small. When I tried it on, it was very tight around my chest and belly and the material is VERY thin and lightweight. This may be ""XXXL‚Äù in China, but in USA it‚Äôs ""L"" at best! And, honestly, there‚Äôs nothing about it that will make you think Baseball!"
1.0,Not like picture. Pink brown
1.0,Looks good but poor quality. One of the pins on the clip bracelet came out within not even a week of receiving it üëéüèª
1.0,These are pink when they are supposed to be white. The description say made in the USA but someone forgot to peel off the made in China sticker.
1.0,Not sure where my order said vest!! I ordered this for a trip this weekend. I even paid the extra shipping cost to get it quicker just to make sure I had it for my trip and it came as a sweater vest...no sleeves. The exact words used to describe this item are &#34;Women Button Down Long Sleeve Basic Soft Knit hooded Cardigan Sweater&#34;.<br />LONG SLEEVE SWEATER!
1.0,"The earrings are beautiful, but extremely heavy.  They hurt my ears.  Was trying to return them, but was unable to.  Great customer service from the company, not as much from Amazon. Have been trying to contact them.  I love this site and let it slide this time :("
1.0,"Some of the styles just don‚Äôt work on an unpierced nose. Others look awkward when molded to the shape of my nose, and others are not malleable enough."
1.0,They fell apart when I open6 the clips. I Spent an hour fixing them .
1.0,Ugliest garment I have ever seen
1.0,Hard material uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,"Horrible quality , very cheap , don‚Äôt waste your money not worth it"
1.0,Gives zero shape. You have to be size 0 to look good
1.0,The size was too small for me way too small the material was awful rough. Cheaply made and a rip on it
1.0,Pretty disappointed with this item! I ordered the black and got the red which is the worst color ever! But I don‚Äôt have time to send these back because it‚Äôs for my nanny for Christmas. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt buy again!
1.0,Cheap and damaged
1.0,They were huge I ordered a large and not good quality
1.0,The worst polo shirts I‚Äôve ever had
1.0,These boots ‚Äúlook cute‚Äù ‚Ä¶ came smelling like cheap plastic‚Ä¶ made in China‚Ä¶ delivered in a plastic draw string bag. Returning - and do not recommend!
1.0,Cheesy eeeek!!!
1.0,Strange fit. Big in certain areas yet small in others. Not a good look or feel.
1.0,"This item is nothing like the image and is very disappointing. It's full of lace which isn't even pictured on the image.  I've never had problems with an amazon item before but this was bad, this is an item I'm not happy to see hanging in my closet."
1.0,The dress is super cute but the fabric is extremely thin and see through
1.0,"I was so pleased with this necklace when it showed up. It is pretty and it lays nicely, but it broke before I had even worn it an hour. To expensive to return and they don't offer to exchange it either. I guess I will try to fix it."
1.0,Super cute! Loved this key chain but it broke after less than a week. I returned it and got another which also broke. Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,"This product is so small , way smaller than I thought :/ cheap fabric as well"
1.0,Never recieved sent 2 emails and nothing from seller. I bought several at the same time so its not 1 dollar I lost and not the point.
1.0,Got this because all the other potty watches are crap. This is no difference. The alarms do not go off. I have them set for every hour during school and they just flat out will not go off. Piece of crap like every other watch we have tried. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"In no way, shape or form does the item I received resemble the item in the picture that was advertised. Looks like a young child cut it out and put it together. Very cheap/poorly made. If I had known it was being shipped from another country, I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered it. I wish I could give it ZERO stars. A big waste of money and a waste of time waiting for delivery‚Ä¶"
1.0,The size was to small it was soppost to be a large and they sent me a small one size fits all I threw them in the trash
1.0,I bought this necklace for a party but it wasn't that sparkly like the picture  is it look kind of dull  it did have some sparkle  but nothing like the picture  I was kind of disappointed  when it arrived
1.0,Super cute and warm BUT mitten came off the string within 24 hours üò≠<br />We have two pairs of these and I feel like if the mittens were more securely attached they would be perfect.
1.0,"Do not buy.  Not what is shown in the picture , engraving sucks"
1.0,Got one at that the right wing did not function. Was sent a second one and the left wing does not function. Hat would fit an infant .Way to small. Very disappointed in this product. I would like  larger hat that works!!!<br />Sandra H.
1.0,Better as a gag gift rather than n e thing
1.0,Not impressed with quality. Looks  cheap.
1.0,I was excited because immediately to the eye this necklace is beautiful. However i went to tie it on my neck for my first use and it completely fell apart from the straps. I wont lie this is a pretty necklace but its not secure enough to stay together
1.0,Oredered twice - received wrong size both times - won‚Äôt try again
1.0,"This sweater looks like what it is - hastily put together, probably by someone who is underpaid, and it also smells moldy. The seams are crooked, there is thread sticking out. There‚Äôs no label and there are no cleaning instruction tags.  And it‚Äôs some sort of synthetic material."
1.0,This product is cheaply made and didn't last 30 days.
1.0,Believe the reviews this shirt runs really small
1.0,These are not squat proof. They also keep riding down so my thighs chafe and I have to keep hiking them up. I got these because my favorite pair from few years back is perfect for pregnancy and very comfortable with my growing belly. These just suck and don‚Äôt have much give to them.
1.0,I was in love with this blouse bought it for work and after working 8 hrs it ripped . Whole time at dinner after work had to hold my arm down ‚Ä¶ Very sad
1.0,"Looks very cheap,  poorly made. Disappointed,  had to return"
1.0,The dress I received looks almost nothing like the picture.
1.0,"I just received this and it is missing sleeves, has no chest pocket, and no drawstring.... feeling like I received the wrong item or someone made a terribly designed poncho. Super annoyed because I saw this on making the cut and was excited."
1.0,Extremely disappointed with this purchase...the dress &#34;fit&#34; me as far as being able to slip into it and zip up but the cut and flare of the dress was so bad that I simply had to return it. The waistline was so high and the pleated skirt stood out stiffly at such odd angles right in the middle of the dress that it almost looked like someone had sewn on the bottom half of the dress at wrong seam.
1.0,"I bought these because they (I thought) were the same brand of mask I bought while I was in Asia‚Äîthe packaging looks the same. Those were great, these were horrible. The material is like craft foam you use for kids; it smells horrible and isn‚Äôt breathable at all."
1.0,These are so cheap it's not worth your time or money.
1.0,Disappointed. It does not look nearly as nice in person- the fabric is kind of stiff and unappealing. The whole thing is cheaply made and flimsy. I will probably never wear it.
1.0,I thought what I was getting would be more substantial was I ever wrong.<br /><br />Placed my info and what attached to my bag you can't see my info. You'd have to take it apart to . see info...poor craftsmanship. Wish I could return.
1.0,"The right moccasin split from the rubber sole 2 hours into wearing them around the house. Absolute garbage, I do not recommend anybody buying them!"
1.0,"Love the shorts , but they don‚Äôt fit !! Sizing is way off .  I recommend getting a size 2x up what you normally wear ."
1.0,Sorry! I dont love it!
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. It‚Äôs not a sweater.
1.0,"After one wash in cold water, the length shrunk 4.5 inches. The width remained the same."
1.0,Product came damaged with stones missing on the outside. Stitches were coming off from the inside if the purse! The ziplock for additional stones came empty!!
1.0,"Strange fit and wrong color. The color was not what was described and instead of being a green, it was bright teal. Amazon took it back so happy with that."
1.0,Great material but runs small
1.0,"Really pretty dress, but way to big. I bought It for Easter but It was just wasnt what I expected.."
1.0,"The quality is not what i was expecting, also is not true to size at all, the medium seems like extra large, the small is still to big..."
1.0,"Don't buy this product! It looks nothing like the picture! I don't know if the seller is aware that they're selling crap, but it's a rip off. Don't get fooled by the picture."
1.0,It broke the second day my wife wore it around her neck horrible... Will be sending it back when were back home.
1.0,"I mean, it's foam cut in the form of a shirt, but IT'S FREAKIN FOAM.  My kid saw this and got all excited for it, so I ordered it.  If I could give zero stars I would.  It's just awful.  I don't know who makes clothing out of squishy foam material, but these weirdos did.  Don't buy it.  If someone finds another vendor who actually makes this out of CLOTH, please let me know!"
1.0,Dress looked nothing like the picture!
1.0,"Did not like the quality,  so cheap"
1.0,Se rompen
1.0,"I ordered a large (I'm 5'3"" and approximately 160 lbs.), and it was huge everywhere and way too long.  I didnt like the fabric either - no shape to the top at all."
1.0,"Too small for curvy girls. I couldn't pull the dress all the way down over my hips and it shed sequins everywhere. The lining barely covers My butt, and the dress is overall scratchy and uncomfortable.  Glad I didn't spend more for it than I did. Definitely not worth it. Disappointed."
1.0,Tight around middle & weird shape through top.
1.0,"See through and a little big for me. I gotba small and it didn't fit Right, a little big. But SEE THROUGH. I ordered the white one. Its more of an off white. I'll be returning."
1.0,Outfit has bad odor.
1.0,"I love the fit of these pants, but after a couple of washings they just fall apart."
1.0,idk man they're cute but they came broken
1.0,This is not as described.  This is the most cheapest quality product that is not even a dress. It just barely goes down my waist and to figure out how to attach the rhinestones to the top even worse.  Would not recommend at all!
1.0,I was disappointed that this didn‚Äôt fit my Mission belt buckle.
1.0,This thing isn‚Äôt even close to what the picture looks like terrible quality
1.0,"the worst breeches I have ever bought. Trying to return them now, alas, the seller wasn't Amazon, but a vendor on Amazon. There are seams on the inside and back of the leg, right where you connect with the saddle, actually painful to wear and ride in them.  I can't imagine why anyone who orders a full seat breech would want one with seams and a &#34;break&#34; in the seat. Really poor design."
1.0,"Incredibly disappointed. It looks nothing like the image. I got the purple - the dress is a completely different shade than the photos, and the trim is a a different shade than the rest of the dress and doesn't match. The fabric feels like the same stuff they use to make Halloween costumes for kids. I got it to wear to my grandmother's funeral - and it was too awful to wear, which left me scrambling to find something else.<br />I WISH it had looked like the photo - the dress in the photo is lovely. Now I'm hesitant to buy other dresses that catch my eye here because I wonder what will arrive. I will try to add a photo before returning it..."
1.0,Not gold looking at all & brook while I was trying it on !!!
1.0,Smaller than advertised. Could not give them to person intended. Should not say men and wen. Only suitable for wen.
1.0,Cheap Chain. I didnt even take it out of the bag. Waiting to return it.
1.0,"I only got 4...... not cool. Need them so I guess I‚Äôm just sticking with it.<br /><br />Make it right and I‚Äôll fix it, but this is not cool."
1.0,This was way too small and the bottom didn't flair out like in this picture.  It was way too tight and i couldn't wear it.
1.0,Too small waste didnt use
1.0,Broke right away. I literally opened it and tried it on. Then it broke in half. Not even kidding.
1.0,I was very disappointed. The socks do nothing to either keep my feet warm or warm them.
1.0,Very gawdy--not what I expected!
1.0,"It broke, i drop it once everything falls apart.<br />Waste money."
1.0,"Wouldn't buy again and wouldn't recommend, the emblem and Pontiac lettering were put on crooked and are not very good quality, definitely a hat that looks good from 5 feet away, for 17$ it's not great might be better off buying probably the same hat off of wish for 9$"
1.0,Very cheaply made.. Foamy artificial leather.
1.0,I didn't like the item
1.0,The photos and description are highly deceiving.  The top comes as a long one piece of fabric that looks like a scarf.  You are required to wrap the long fabric strip around yourself to make it fit in the crisscross pattern shown in the photo. I cannot see how this would work functionally as an actual bikini top.  The edges are unfinished so there is no support at all.  The likelihood of a wardrobe malfunction with any size bust is extremely high.  Complete waste of time.
1.0,"Just arrived yesterday the picture showed 3 bras in a package, navy, gray, and beige. My package only had two,navy and beige. No gray. Going back, false  advertising."
1.0,Belt does not come assembled.  You have to cut it and place buckle on belt.
1.0,Purchased 6 pairs in 2016 and were very good even now.  However I purchased 3 more in 2020 and are real trash.  Waist  band rubber shot while old ones still solid.  Material real thin compared to older ones.  And definitely not made here.  As a matter of fact I can seem to be aware of anything they sell made in USA.  They lost me as a customer.
1.0,Measurements inaccurate. Could not fit my device.
1.0,"In the description of this belt it said leather.  This is a belt one would find at the  99 ¬¢ store.  I wouldn't care if it was quality vegan leather, I think after a few times of wearing it it would scar easily.  It's going back.<br />Ya get what ya pay for üòè"
1.0,"Do not waste your money. Not even close to description OR image, so I returned it. P.O.S. merch. And ugly, too. Not cute ugly, or funky ugly, or nerd ugly. Rather: Tragic ugly. Christmas sweater ugly. Javanka ugly. Horseshoe bat ugly. A clown would be embarrassed to wear those pale flesh-colored clown pants. (No offense meant to clowns.) But beware: while the refund was prompt, shipping costs to send it back home to its family in China cancelled it out. May it'll get hung up in some cargo container, where it can live the remainder of its days hanging out on the piers at the Port of Long Beach."
1.0,Sizing is not even remotely close. XXL would be more accurately labeled as a Large at best. Very low quality materials. Most buttons felt like they were close to falling off right out of the box and the fabric is just about paper thin. Returning immediately.
1.0,This is an awful product. Most items are so cheap they broke almost immediately after taking them out of the package! Buy something else for a more reasonable price.
1.0,"shipping took a bit, and the material is super cheap and crunchy like. Donating it...."
1.0,Inside very cheaply made. ...not very impressed
1.0,"I receive it with damage! like 4 hole, I hope I can receive a new one or refund."
1.0,Ordered the &#34;plus size&#34; and they were a little snug...they ripped.
1.0,"Dislike; too small, bad construction and poor quality in general.<br />I sent it back and I am waiting for my refund."
1.0,Cheap material. Seams rolled up and the elastic waistband twisted and got lumpy after only one wash. Super wrinkly too. Just cheap. Very very cheaply made. Save your money and go to a discount store and buy a better pair for half the price.
1.0,Only had it for 2 Months and the handles broke!
1.0,Too long for a tunic and too short as a dress. The material is see through and thinner than expected so you will probably need to wear an undershirt or sweater over it. Size ran big but is tight in the chest making it an unflattering cut.
1.0,Not functional. Kept falling off
1.0,Couldn't use to small.
1.0,"It's TERRIBLE! The stitching is horrible as it cuts off the words. The material isn't nice either, feels like I have a bathing suit on my face. Also, I have to keep readjusting it on my face. Sending it back"
1.0,Barely similar to the photo shown online and fits like a huge sack. Would not recommend.
1.0,"I loved the way this looked online, so I bought it for our formal event. I opened it to only find out that the glittery sections are completely see through. Do not buy unless that is what you are in to. The overall fir was good but the material felt like a cheap Halloween costume.<br /><br />One star is way to many!!!!"
1.0,Not discrete
1.0,Mine broke before i got it out of the package!
1.0,will not protect you from anything
1.0,these shoes appeared to be darker than photo and they are made from some shiny material and makes irritating squeaky sounds when your feet cause friction
1.0,"It runs mad small and the material is CHEAP‚Ä¶ RUN, don‚Äôt even add it to your cart. I‚Äôm returning this ASAP."
1.0,Disappointed. HP machine rejects the cartridge.
1.0,"If I could give this cheap piece of crap negative stars, I would. That thing broke within five minutes of wearing it. Waste of money and time spent looking at this and ordering it. You've been warned."
1.0,"This has to be a fake bag.  I've only had this bag for 4 months and it is already showing tons of wear and tear.  The ""leather"" is rubbing right off on the handle where I carry it and where the shoulder strap is attached.  I've had genuine Michael Kors bags purchased at the mall retailers and they have lasted for 4+ years before showing this kind of wear and tear.  My mistake thinking I could buy a legitimate bag on Amazon.  I will not make this mistake again."
1.0,"This outfit doesn't look anything like the picture. The fabric isn't good quality. Overall, I'm dissatisfied with this product."
1.0,"It was too small, even though the sizing should‚Äôve worked out OK. Additionally, the dress itself is blue!"
1.0,Looks nothi ng like the picture. More like a top than a dress. Size is off. Ruffled bottom is a lot smaller.  Overall wrong dress.
1.0,super ugly and terrible fit
1.0,And after literally one wear the piling started. Little balls of fuzzies all over the pants. And they feel so rough. They‚Äôre going to rip any day now.
1.0,I was unable to wear the dress. It came with dirt marks. The dress is beautiful but I have to return it.
1.0,Cheap material. Bad waistband
1.0,The elastic is too short
1.0,The band wouldn't snap into the actual watch. Absolutely useless.
1.0,I was so excited to find gold party hats for my daughters bday.  These hats were absolutely impossible to put together we sat down at the restaurant and for the first 20 minutes tried to put them together. Complete waste of money.  These hats were absolutely impossible to put together we sat down at the restaurant and for the first 20 minutes tried to put them together. Complete waste of money. I had to throw them in the garbage.
1.0,"I bought this product in February planning for my 25th wedding anniversary get away for this past weekend.  We used the bag twice going to the beach, 2 beach towels, a bag of chips, a small paperback book, goggles and a few misc items--maybe 10 pounds at the most.  It broke on the second day.  Not worth the money."
1.0,"Incredibly ugly motif. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
1.0,"Horrible fabric, like a costume. It‚Äôs cheap and tacky and looks nothing like the photo."
1.0,"Great colors, but much o small for me. Doesn't fit as shown."
1.0,The shirt is a great material and fit as expected. But it‚Äôs black and red not blue and red. I‚Äôm going to return it.
1.0,I wasted my money ship material
1.0,this was so disappointing it showed up with stones missing and one of the butterflies miss a loop to hold it in the chain
1.0,"Dislike. I needed these for an event & am sorely disappointed. They are faded; the part that goes through your ear is broken on one of them. Won‚Äôt be buying anything from this shop again. I have no idea what I‚Äôm going to do now. Money wasted, hopefully I can get it back."
1.0,the shirt is a little different than the picture and the arms are small
1.0,Had it less than 30 days and the nose piece already broke off returning item.
1.0,"I ordered a grey one and got a pink one. It looks like it would be more of a knitted material, but it's more of a nylon material. I returned this product for a refund."
1.0,I didn't like the rings at all they didn't even fit the top of my pinkie
1.0,Socks got a hole in them after less than  33 min of play.
1.0,This product is made in China with Chinese sizing. Ordered a 3X but would maybe fit a size 8. Don't order thus by your normal size. It WON'T fit. Size onside garment is 5.
1.0,Didn't help at all. Didn't keep my neck cool since it didn't stay cool itself. Very few beads inside. Not worth the $.
1.0,Too big. I ordered a M size and I got xxl size<br />I don‚Äôt recommend this product
1.0,Terrible. Will NOT stick to Maui Jim lenses. Have been trying since delivery.
1.0,"Strap broke on first wear, before I even left the house!"
1.0,The clasp pops open sporadically - an awful product that would unexpectedly drop your expensive Apple watch.
1.0,Popped
1.0,"The earrings are really cute. The packaging was terrible.  Just wrapped in plastic and put in an envelope, so the posts are really bent.  Hopefully they don't break. These are a Christmas gift so getting them damaged is extra disappointing."
1.0,The watch is very pretty. I have wearing for a couple of months. It is losing tim4 e. Over night it is off by 4 or 5 hours. This has happened about 4 times.  I looked up my order and I have passed my return date. So I'm stuck with it. Buyer beware.
1.0,I ordered these and they look like kids size. Had to return.  Return was easy
1.0,DISLIKE! These are not meant for working out. They will fall. The booty illusion works. Only function is to be worn around the house for you significant other to do double triple takes on your booty.
1.0,What came is nothing that was pictured.
1.0,Not true to American Size
1.0,it broke in transit and I couldn't return it. 0 stars if possible.
1.0,"Says guaranteed one black and one color pair but all I got was 3 black and a gray, which doesn‚Äôt count as color. I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed and would not recommend this brand to anybody."
1.0,Can't wear it
1.0,Nice idea but they fall apart just after a few uses around the pool. Disappointed
1.0,Runs small and colors not as pictured.  Make sure you measure your hand with the thumb when you slide it on. It was too small for me and I had to send it back.  I wanted the sky blue color as shown but received a faded white and light blue bracelet.
1.0,Received broken.  Stem of one earring broke off.
1.0,It stopped charging after 1 week of normal wear
1.0,"Save your money and put it toward a better product. Damaged on the very first airline trip taken on, broken at the wheel on the corner. Complete waste of money."
1.0,"Ordered one size larger, needed 3 sizes larger than my normal size at least. Could not remotely try to wear it. Material was about what you would expect in this price, larger texture than i would like for a wedding, but nice enough for a prom dress."
1.0,Buen material pero muy disgustada la ped√≠ gris y la enviaron verde y porq lo hicieron yo pago por el producto tienen que enviar lo que compro y ordeno  la tuve que regalar no hace juego con mi wallet
1.0,Cheap cotton. Not accurately sized...the xxl is for l
1.0,"Do not purchase this product, the quality is terrible. Both straps are tearing off of the backpack. My son was in second grade and carried his lunch box and some papers in the bag. He used this backpack for maybe two months before summer started. This is also his second one; we exchanged the first one we purchased because the strap was tearing on that one too! He absolutely loved this backpack so in hopes that the first was just a fluke we got him a second one and the quality is just as terrible. Do not waste your money!"
1.0,Tapers down  gets verry skinny compared to the factory 20mm band on my 44mm Samsung active 2 uses a 20mm band. Felt cheesy and the pin has a deathgrip on the band where it feels it's going to rip when you remove it. I went back to the OEM band after about 5 minutes.  If you prefer more the women's style skinny bands you might like it but I prefer the ones that don't taper and stay 20mm all the way across.<br />Ohh and lastly the pins aren't set in place so it makes putting it on alot harder than the OEM bands.
1.0,"While these gloves seem to be well made, they DO NOT keep your fingers warm. Tried them on a twenty minute walk with 20 degree temperature and came back with fingers just as cold as if I had worn a pair of thin dress gloves."
1.0,The scarves üß£  are nice but they are not SILK They are POLYESTER!!!<br />Seller should contact me immediately!!
1.0,Looked like a burlap sack when I took it out of the package. Didn't come with the belt like in the picture.
1.0,The holder for the shoestrings are poorly made fell apart in two days of wearing very difficult to tie now since they are the elastic shoestrings
1.0,made cheap and fell apart just after a few days of wearing them! and one shoe stopped charging!
1.0,Low quality and hurt when I put them on.
1.0,"hat itself is of decent quality, but the logo itself washed off (thin nylon letterings) came off after 2-3 washes. i didn't even use the dryer to dry, just a gentle cycle wash"
1.0,"Didn't even last a week, nor two days.."
1.0,Strap feels cheap and it did not come with spring bars or spring remover.
1.0,This dress swallowed me whole. I ordered it for a funeral and ended up looking like I was joining a cult. No thank you.
1.0,When I received the bracelet the stone was broke off in the package. I had to super glue it back on. Cheaply made.
1.0,ordered and extra large and it was still to small. The sleeves where extremely short and the bulge in the front made me look pregnant. Donated to local church.
1.0,Big stone fell out immediately on one pair
1.0,I bought two wristbands and they both broke within a few weeks.
1.0,I have only wear this for couple weeks and it broke off my wrist and gone.
1.0,"The neckline is literally cut with a pair of scissors, making it look really cheap and awkward."
1.0,I LIKED THE PRICE BUT RUNS VERY VERY SMALL.
1.0,after first day ! a lot of scratches has applied on it!
1.0,Top is way to small and skirt is too big
1.0,Not knee high.  Not good quality.  Tried them on and promptly returned.
1.0,"The sweatshirt it self was not bad quality, but the large I ordered was smaller than a regular small!!  Very disappointed!!"
1.0,This hat was way too small for my head did not fit very well more for a child than for adults.
1.0,Functions don't work and can't change minute hand.
1.0,Just putting on it was to big on me I have to have it half way up the back of my head to stay on
1.0,"It is a nice tank top but the shamrocks are nowhere close to where they should be. When the tank is on, the shamrocks are way below where they are supposed to be."
1.0,Very poor quality. The string on the trousers came apart with the first wash! Very disappointed!
1.0,This is cheap and flimsy. I own another that I bought a few years ago and needed a match... the quality of this item suggests it should be priced at $1.99
1.0,no...no...no...  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUY THIS ITEM!  THIS IS THE 2ND REVIEW I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS AND THE 1ST ONE I WAS ASKED TO REMOVE IT..In that review I was nice and polite and HONEST review.. Repost it and you'll see what I mean. The only nice or positive about this item is the color..
1.0,"The straps were definitely closer than in the photos. Lots of sewing issues with threads hanging. Belt not attached. I really wanted to like this dress (I bought 5 colors) but after receiving the first one, I cancelled the other 4. It was just dowdy on my petite frame. Might look great on someone who weighs 110 and is 5'10"" but the quality issue remains. Also, reminder: if you are planning to wear without a bra and have uneven ""sisters"", the ruching on the top will accentuate the unevenness. You'll need a strapless bra."
1.0,"I would give no star,  it's cheapest looking shirt ever."
1.0,"I have had these on my wish list for months and finally got them in my stocking for Christmas. This is extra appropriate because they are more like stockings than leggings. I have plenty of room in them, so it's not that they're too small, they are just completely see-through! If they weren't a gift, I'd 100% be returning them."
1.0,"I should have listened to the other reviewers. The disc part of these cut up my mouth terribly. I've been wearing this style for 5 years now and never have had an issue. I contacted Amazon to return them, it was that bad."
1.0,The fake stone is glued into the fake silver so it is off center and you can see the glue!<br />What is this? A gum ball machine prize that costs a dollar?
1.0,This is a adjustable ring it‚Äôs not what I expected if you open ring to make it bigger it goes Oval shape and it fits very uncomfortable
1.0,"I have a Liftmaster with the red learn button. this keypad is not compatible, or is defective."
1.0,I bought this for a low cut dress and thought it would give me the support and cleavage cut I was looking for. It did not. No Support at all so therefore no cleavage. Don't buy!
1.0,"I bought two - same size 6-9 months. Both arrived, but one suit was clearly much LARGER than the other!<br />Both labels were marked 6-9 months.I called the company and got voice mail and a real hassle in order to return.Poor customer service."
1.0,Really really material that frayed all over the place after one wash
1.0,Unfortunately it‚Äôs a cheap looking ugly marble with globs of white inside. Doesn‚Äôt look as attractive as the photo.
1.0,Ordered 3x and it fits a medium
1.0,What did I expect
1.0,"not large enough, no return label my leg is 23"" to tight need inches so I could buy correct ones , love to have in larger size to clown in<br />linda"
1.0,"Disappointed. Received these and both posts were bent flat. Tried to straighten and they both broke. They are light, which is good for not pulling the earlobe but very flimsy."
1.0,"I ordered the antique silver as a gift and it was discolored and the clasps were so bent that it didn't close properly. I  immediately requested a refund and sent back. Very disappointed, as this was a Mother's day gift."
1.0,Set of 4 apparently means only 1 ring.
1.0,The shoe left shoe is defective rendering  it unusable. Nothing from customer service.
1.0,"loved the appearance of the bracelet, however tarnished in 2 days"
1.0,"Zero stretch or curve, of you have any actual curves or hips none the less broad shoulders don't get"
1.0,"Horrible design. Most of the length of these straps is not as pictured.. it is a chain (for adjusting? Who has that small of shoulders?)  In mid chain there is a necklace clasp which was useful for packing but now what do you use the clasp for? Its just there .. in the middle of your strap.  Stupid. If the strap went the other way, then the back which shows out of your tank tops is just a chain..eiither way.. half of this strap is chain and it shows no matter how you wear the strap"
1.0,Worst boots I‚Äôve ever worn. They hurt my ankle were the zipper is and the footbed isn‚Äôt at all soft. I have at least 10 pairs of boots and these are horribly uncomfortable.  DO NOT BUY.
1.0,"This shirt may be cheap but you will probably never wear it. The colors are way off, tan looks more like a funky yellow and it looks like a shirt made for a doll. It doesn‚Äôt flatter at all , just save yourself the trouble and pass it up."
1.0,These are extremely heavy. Too heavy to wear comfortably. I didn't give them as the gift as I planned due to their weight. They are painted pieces of steel.
1.0,"Defective product received. I returned it and ordered two other colors that are beautiful. The Mermaid and the Multicolored. They look nice, flowers put on correctly. The flowers on the Passion had white of the cap showing through and glue on the flower. I was too skeptical to try and order it again. The seller is very good. I would order again from Amazon representing Headcovers.com and the Amazon price is much better."
1.0,"Poorly made, doesn‚Äôt fit like pictures"
1.0,"Not for me. They were a pain in the butt to get on and keep on. I'll end up gettimg my shorts tailored to avoid the shirt coming up.<br /><br />The ones that clip to the dock may have been better, but im not going to try them."
1.0,Didn't like these swim trunks. Poor quality and fit.
1.0,Was to big and under the arm was torn
1.0,Returning.  Had switched to the 2 pack and ordered one color then ordered another color and it defaulted to the 1 pack.
1.0,"I do not recommend these.  At first when I took them out of the package, I thought they might be okay.  However, they are too big, there is no band to tuck the rest of the band into and they don't fit right into the watch.  They would easily slide out of the watch part.  I can't believe these have ANY good reviews at all."
1.0,"I had this item maybe 4 hours before it fell off. I went grocery shopping & once I returned home it was gone. I liked the look of the bracelet, but it was obviously poorly made. Total waste of hard earned money!!! I actually wanted to give the item no stars. However, it wouldn't allow me to submit this review without giving it at least 1 star. Totally bogus rating system!!!"
1.0,"Was not as soft as I thought it was supposed to be,  did not look like picture"
1.0,This item is not a 2x. I let my mom try it on and she is a sz. 8.  It did not fit her. The item is tagged with a 2X label.
1.0,What was advertised was not true. Tha band did not include a buckle and size was incorrect.
1.0,"I have not even owned this necklace for 2 months I don't think and it has already completely lost every bit of its color. It was a cheesy color gold to start with, but now it's a hideous tarnished brown color. It started turning almost immediately, so I let my 4 year daughter wear it. Now it has turned so much she won't even wear it.. I know it wasn't much money, but a complete waste nonetheless"
1.0,"One was over-the-knee and fit perfectly, but the other went below my knee. Careless packaging I guess."
1.0,I tried two of them neither could accurate time.
1.0,"These are adorable, but the back doesn't show very well."
1.0,"This product doesn‚Äôt have a storage compartment. It‚Äôs VERY sticky & clings to EVERYTHING when you‚Äôre not wearing it.  And yet, when you want to wear it, it doesn‚Äôt cling to my skin."
1.0,Too low quality
1.0,Very cute...only problem is you can‚Äôt put down the windows. I‚Äôve lost them so many times and had to stop and pick them up . Would be nice to figure out how to have them stay on. I had to keep them on the back windows since we use those less.
1.0,Sizing us horrible. Tryed twice and one was incredibly tight so I went up a size and it was so big..
1.0,Bought because of heavy duty description and it was available for shorter ship time. Tried to tighten the webbing and the buckle housing just broke apart. Very poor quality. Flash on the part too.
1.0,unable to walk wearing it; slippery
1.0,Should have used lock tight coin came unscrewed and lost it super pissed
1.0,Im 200lbs i looked like the caterpillar from bugs life üòÇ I wouldn‚Äôt think they where going to look that small very pretty and goodish quality but definitely for a very petite adult or good for kids! I ended up buying some bigger ones but use the other two accessories those worked great
1.0,"These low rise are too tall, I end up folding the waistband over to keep them from showing out the top of my pants."
1.0,If I wanted a cheap itchy dress I would not have spent this amount and ordered it from Shein instead
1.0,"Comes as flimsy rubbery plastic, meaning the needles don't stay straight and it gets goofy looking.  Also, the glow in the dark stuff faded off on anything else it touched.<br /><br />You would be better off making your own."
1.0,Broke when took out of packing.
1.0,the foam is thin and flimsy so it gets warped and causes more camel toe
1.0,they broke when putting on bar
1.0,So tiny and flimsy
1.0,"Too tiny, not good quality earrings. The back broke of a set in a day of wearing.. haven‚Äôt tried the rest yet as they look cheap dollar den quality"
1.0,These were broken when I opened up the pack; the loop was disconnected from dangling part of the earring.
1.0,It will not fit my watch I was very disappointed!
1.0,Cheap broke right away
1.0,"The blouse was too small, no refunds.  Finally got in touch with them and they said keep it. And sent me $.87<br />Crazy people."
1.0,"Khaki color only, swim pants material"
1.0,This shirt is not what I expected.  It would be better if it was cotton like the picture. The heart is mis-shaped and the trim around the collar is really ugly.
1.0,The product seems durable but with too small for my son and you ended up donating it
1.0,"I am 5.5 and this dress was too short for me. There is an empire waist seam, which is unflattering if you have a chest. It's kind of a mullet dress, longer in the back. I did not like it at all but I gave it to my sister and she does like it. She pairs it with leggings. She is a little shorter than me so it isn't quite as short on her."
1.0,It did not look at all like pictures and was a Jersey material. They are refunding but I have to pay to ship it back.
1.0,"Though the style resembles the photos, the actual look is cheap and the sizing runs a bit large."
1.0,The material is itchy and uncomfortable.  Washed hoping it would soften but it was the same itchy and stiff.  Would not recommend this particular dress.
1.0,This is my third one of these hats. The first two were perfect but this one is quite large
1.0,Item received all balled up and wrinkled.
1.0,How come the full length stretch pant in the pic are delivered as 3/4th length.
1.0,About 2 sizes too small and crummy quality
1.0,"Bought this based on reviews. The sizing was wrong and the material was horrible. It was a thick, shiny, polyester. A major fail on everything but the color."
1.0,"On my second wear, after one wash the entire dress fell apart. I‚Äôm taking the top separated from the bottom. What an absolute waste of money. The first time I wore it I was so excited. I loved it, looked so cute. But wow what a piece of trash. Would not recommend. Terrible purchase, poor quality."
1.0,Very uncomfortable to say the least. Have to keep cutting off plastic pieces coming through the material scratching my wrist.would not recomend them.
1.0,"Loved the color!  However, right at the hips on both sides there is a seam malfunction that literally pops out like wings or inside out pockets.  So I purchased another one, hoping it was a one time defect - ugh - received the second one and same thing.  I went ahead and washed and ironed but did not work.  Had to keep it but the other one was returned.  Total bummer."
1.0,Fabric is not what it looks like in the picture.. instead it's some cheap looking material and sweater is sewn together so poorly that the whole thing is crooked... all I can really say about this sweater is that it's cheap and a waste of money
1.0,Heavy and good quality but pinches skin.
1.0,"They were perfection, all my dreams had come true, I was living in a perfect dreamworld on some nice drugs trotting in some surprisingly comfortable princess shoes (I was at Paradiso btw) when everything came crashing down, including myself, but gracefully mind you. The sandal completely separated from the platform! I had to wear a friends shoes that he packed extra otherwise I would have been barefoot!<br /><br />After inspecting them I realized the sandals, although good equality, were just hot glued to the platforms which were also decent quality, the way they put them together is just not strong enough to hold for a whole night out (I wore mine for about 4 hours before they broke). Might be good for photo shoots but not actually wear.<br /><br />I also cannot get a refund because I was sick after diso with a broken down car and missed the deadline to return them through Amazon and the company will not refund me or give me a credit :/"
1.0,The tops are a little flimsy and had a strong burnt plastic smell. Had to return it.
1.0,The product I received does not look quite the same and stinks of petroleum
1.0,Horrible! I wouldn't recommend these to anyone .  The trimming is off and can see  out of the sides
1.0,The adhesive didn't stick at the outer parts and when I took it off it was very painful. Definitely not a push up bra as the picture shows. Don't recommend for those heavier breast.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt like the product. Quality is meh and fit is not good.
1.0,The jacket was poorly made and the seller refused to pay the return shipping or even provide a shipping label. Stay away from this company.
1.0,Material was too thin and didn't fit snug
1.0,I pulled these out of the bag and I immediately put them on because they were so soft but....2 huge holes in the back!! UGH!!!!!! So tacky! So disappointing!!
1.0,Broke two days after I received it!
1.0,"Quality is very poor. I am very small boned and I typically wear a size medium or small. On this particular blouse I thought that I would order a large and wear a belt with the blouse. The problem is that the sleeves were made for a 7 year old child not only are they too short but, the buttons on the sleeves won't even button up. The shirt comes from Hong Kong and the sizing is different then U.S sizes. The quality of the shirt looks nothing like this picture and if I had it to do all over I wouldn't have wasted my time on this purchase. Day 4 and I am still waiting for a refund I am very disappointed in the quality, sizing, and lack of service! Mark my word the blouse/shirt is NOTHING like the picture!"
1.0,this jacket turned me blue ..... smurf life ... üôÑüôÑüôÑ
1.0,Runs very small an XL is a size 8.  Not made of cotton and polyester like most hoodies. Gave it to my mom.
1.0,"These are pretty terrible laces, I can't figure out why other folks like them. I bought them for my kids and they were pretty much stretched out beyond their useful life in about 2 days. They had to tie the end in knots just to get their shoes to say on, and needless to say, that pretty much destroys the whole reason for getting stretchable laces.<br /><br />I purchased LockLaces after these and those things are awesome, so save you money and get those first."
1.0,Not flattering at all. Material not comfortable. Returned item.
1.0,"This suit was cheaply made and did not fit well.  The cup size is very small in proportion to the rest, I am a 36 c, size 9.  The color is black and not navy.  The straps are white on the underside which shows when tied.  The skirt is not hemmed and has a raw edge."
1.0,Ordered small<br />And it was too big for me my feelings are hurt so I sold it to someone else
1.0,The watch band did not last a week. I am very upset. First the screws started coming out on one side and I tightened them and then the connector would not hold the watch and it felt off my arm....so disappointed.
1.0,Starfish came cracked one side broken. I had to crazy glue it together
1.0,"The glasses glasses are sunglasses with a film over the lenses which show little hearts from light sources.  Its not great but they look kind of cool if you can get the light sources just right.  However, this was supposed to be christmas stocking stuffers and we only tested one and it turned out 2 of the 4 were faulty because they didn't even have the heart film on them.  Hoo-ray.<br /><br />Contacted seller and asked for two that worked and all they responded was a straight up, I can refund 6 dollars.  I responded no I would like the two replacements please because you can't buy 2 with 6 dollars.  This was for my family on Christmas and would like two more that worked please.<br /><br />Yeah, they refunded $6.50.  No further response, no nothing.  It was the biggest ""just shut up and take the money go go, shoo shoo"" that I've had on Amazon.<br /><br />I want to be sure that everybody knows what they're getting into when buying from this seller.  As for us?  I just want to never think of this again, but I'm sure as heck not going to keep quiet about it on their reviews page. :)<br /><br />Good luck, hope you get 4 working sunglasses everybody.  They really only work best on strong sources of light or maybe night time.  But don't be that guy who wears their sunglasses at night. üòé"
1.0,The first 5 masks that were pulled from random in this package the rear loops ripped off. Finally got a good one that lasted.
1.0,"Junk, cheap. Picture doesn't show how cheap and crappy it is!<br />Pay $1 at the Dollar Tree for this, instead of buying it on here."
1.0,"Too short, needed a tank top underneath"
1.0,"Material felt like cardboard, far too short noto as pictured. Did not lie fitted to body stood out like a bad cheerleader outfit"
1.0,"This is a very poor quality fabric. It doesn't look flattering at all. It's too thin and if you are a curvy type, it will show every single ""roll"" you've got. Returned it. Foe reference I am 5.1, 36d, side 10 usually."
1.0,Wrong color and size
1.0,It's not real moldavite
1.0,I ordered a large and the package said large but the actual shaper was a medium. the fabric is stiff and scratchy. will be returning and buying a different brand
1.0,"These are nothing like the tiktok social media leggings being advertised.  No stretch and very small compared to measurements.  When I tried to return them, the auto-generated label had an address that UpS could not deliver to.  After that, the seller kept offering me a tiny refund in order to just keep them.  Amazon eventually had to step in and clear up the issue.  The leggings are definitely not at all cute, warm or well made.  I‚Äôll be using the fabric in a craft at some point."
1.0,Sunday dress
1.0,"did not fit - it may have if the tie string was about 10 inches longer, 20 would have been better.  I returned item."
1.0,These were made wrong. Too small on even my 5 year old. Such a disappointment.
1.0,The quality is awful
1.0,"This necklace is of such poor quality, I may not give it as a gift.  I was supposed to get a pair of blue Safire earrings free with my order of the blue Safire necklace.  In stead I received two mother and child necklaces. Yuk."
1.0,"I am 5'9, this dress doesn't look good on taller women"
1.0,These aren't supposed to be called boyshort. Those I've received look more like hipster.
1.0,"The tassle trim is lighter than the product pictures, it drastically changed the look of this product. I wanted the product I saw as advertised."
1.0,Bar is way to long and heart is way to big I don‚Äôt mind wearing it upside down but the bar is just way to long
1.0,"Does no one know the true name of this symbol anymore... This is by no means a symbol of peace.The exact opposite infact. I just don't understand how no one remembers Nero and what he did...Where this sign came from..Nero's Cross is the true name of this and the reason it looks the way it does is because this demonic man murdered Christians in droves and the only way to keep him from killing you if you where a Christian is to take a Cross and flip it upside down then break the arms downward ergo renouncing your faith in front of him. That is the true history behind this ""So called"" peace sign. It's truly sad no one remembers and even worse that this is thought to mean peace because in reality it has nothing to do with peace and everything to do with turning your back on God and if you don't, you die. Want proof? Educate yourself about who and what Nero was."
1.0,IT SMELLS AWFULLY CHEMICAL. I can smell the chemicals even after taking them off.<br /> Cheap chinese crap. Don't buy.
1.0,a different color shirt that was purchased was delivered. The fabric of the shirt is not soft. Did not like.
1.0,Very poorly made you could see light around the zipper would not give good protection I threw them away
1.0,"The picture makes it look like it would be flattering, but it was not. Additionally, where it crosses in the front choked me! I couldn't imagine wearing it at all. Sent it back immediately."
1.0,"Have ordered these leggings multiple times and they were excellent.  Reordered 3 more pairs but  this time they came from overseas, took weeks and they are laughably poor quality."
1.0,This is too thin despite the fur lining. Also the sleeves are so short it doesn't even reach my wrists
1.0,My bracelet knots began to come apart within a few weeks. Not happy with it and can no longer wear it
1.0,Soles coming off after 45 days. Straps too loose so soles slap when walking.
1.0,"This was the 2nd order for the same item, but noticed the changes of material. The new vest I got was made from softer material with much tighter mash patterns result in less air flow.  The researchers shown the vest was made from the same 3d air flow material as the vehicle seats. ($3/meter).  Over priced for the product, and it doesn't work any better the the old version. Returned for full refund."
1.0,Disgusted with this purchase. Waaay too big. Definitely been washed several times judging the way the tags look. Smells like a musty attic.
1.0,"I really wanted to like this band and gave it a few weeks trial run but I've since given it away. I couldn't get the band to stay tucked in the metal band rings (yes I know how to tuck a NATO band) and tried different ways but it always came undone. The edges of the band were uneven and pretty rough from the heated cuts along with the holes. The quick-connect to the watch was too sketchy and loose for me to be confident that I wouldn't lose my expensive Garmin watch. If I were you, I'd pass and try a different band."
1.0,I returned this product as soon as I received it. The fabric was like that of a fireman or hunter.
1.0,"For $40, it's very cheap made, bad quality and see through"
1.0,Very cute lasted a while but then it started to chip and hurt my nose and caused infection
1.0,"These shorts were a huge let down.  There is almost no gel in these shorts.  Buyer beware: in the product photo, the word &#34;gel&#34; can be seen in two places on the rear part of the shorts.  This is false, there is just regular padding there, no gel."
1.0,Design fell apart after THREE washes despite following cleaning instructions. Dont buy.
1.0,This shirt doesn't look like the picture!
1.0,This is the crappiest piece of crap watch I‚Äôve ever purchased!! I ordered it twice & both times it was defective!! I wanted to give it to my son for Christmas since he‚Äôs going into a nursing program next month but I‚Äôm going to find another brand to replace it now. What a huge disappointment!!
1.0,Cheaply made product that broke after two uses. Avoid this one at all costs.
1.0,Too heavy to wear them!
1.0,it broke the same day i bought it
1.0,I was really disappointed in this pair. I have purchased previously however this pair is super thin and has brush marks on the legs that can't be smoothed out.
1.0,"Returned this item. When I received it, it was like a glitter bomb exploded everywhere. Can‚Äôt even wear b/c I feel like I would get glitter all over my clothes and wind up looking like a ‚Äúprofessional dancer.‚Äù"
1.0,WAS TOO SMALL
1.0,"These fell apart in less than a month. Very disappointed in the quality, especially for the price. Contacting the seller to ask for a refund."
1.0,Sent back color was more like a purple blaaa
1.0,Littke beads fell off first day. Had to consistently put ring back in after it came out numerous times; just can‚Äôt keep in. Like how it looks; not worth buying.
1.0,"Very very disappointed after I received the package.  The scarf is so small, and not according to the measurements given in the description."
1.0,They were extremely thin and tore on his first wear.  Sticking to the old water shoes which don't look like my grandson was walking bare foot on the beach.
1.0,"Received Smashed , poor quality"
1.0,They looked so cute.  I couldn‚Äôt wait to get them in the mail! But once I opened the box I realized how huge they were.  Desired to try them on anyways but they were high and not very comfortable to wear under clothes at all. I keep worrying they‚Äôd get  caught on something and rip out
1.0,"This item looks nothing like the photo. It has a weird bow to it rather then being flat. It looks more like a flower. The only stone is the center, around the edges what looks like stones is actually just raised bits of silver. I can‚Äôt even say that it‚Äôs stamped 925, there is a little etching that has a scratch over so you can‚Äôt read it. Majorly disappointed."
1.0,"My earrings don't look like the pieces advertised. They are much smaller in size and the round fasten is completely missing from my pair, and the hook looks cheap. Don't buy these, you never know what you're going to get!"
1.0,"I thought they would be the same fit and quality as my 10 year old size 46 Oxtar boots.TCX acquired Oxtar but the fit is not the same. Very sad, I loved my Oxtar boots<br /><br />Unfortunately I had to return them since they didn't fit my calf area. I could not close the velcro calf part of the boot. so I went with Sidi and they fit fine."
1.0,Very small! So disappointed :/
1.0,What a joke! Looks like a kindergarten art project. You can see the scissor cuts and glue. Heavy plastic mushrooms on paper thin felt. Pathetic!!
1.0,"They were very nice when  I first got them, they fit perfect, the material is kinda thin, and a bit see-thru, but I liked them, after washing them I hung them to dry, no dryer, and they still shrunk shorter and smaller. Not good, can't wear them anymore :( very dissappointed"
1.0,Tried on gym leggings and they are very visible.
1.0,"This is cheaply made and for a child. Would not recommend for an adult, unless you want the wings to choke you all night."
1.0,They are 2 sizes smaller than they should be & way too short even if you find someone to fit the waistline.
1.0,I ordered an extra large while usually I am a medium and these where EXTREMLEY tight
1.0,Poor quality. Also size listed was not correct. These were HUGE! Returned.
1.0,They broke the first time I tried to wear them. The part that goes through your piercing broke off. If I could give zero stars I would. I think they would have been very cute but they are made so cheaply it‚Äôs not worth your time.
1.0,wrong product
1.0,"They're disposable quality, but maybe not quite at a disposable price. The ""return"" option is gone because it's been nearly a month since the purchase, so the best I can do is warn others here."
1.0,It was poorly made
1.0,Not good at all!  Super thin fabric that saga in all the wrong places. I donated them immediately after trying them on.
1.0,"We have had great luck with Phoebe Cat pajamas in the past (we have a couple pairs that have lasted years and are still in great shape), but this pair is disappointing. The quality is not at all what I expected. My son loved the dinosaurs and was so excited to wear them, but after to two or three wears (while sleeping, so no rambunctious play or any real ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù that I anticipate with his play clothes), I noticed that the pants are coming apart at the seams. Unfortunately, we are three days outside the return window so I feel like I have thrown away my money and my son is disappointed he didn‚Äôt get to wear the pajamas more than a few times."
1.0,I ordered 2 of them. the quality is okay but the sizes are TERRIBLE! would not recommend.
1.0,"This is listed as a rolling bag, which it is not."
1.0,Clasp does not close and opens up on its own in 2 of 5.
1.0,12-18 months is equivolent to a 3-6 months. Returned.
1.0,This purse will conceal a gun yes but it's very cheaply made. The rhinestones on it are crooked abs not lined up correctly.  It just looks tacky. I will be most likely be returning. The only good thing is the color purple
1.0,"Great looking band, but the clip does not lock in to my Samsung GS2. The link removal tool is flimsy, but got the job done. Unfortnately, these 3rd party bands seem to always be problems for me. Had this band locked in, I would have given it 5 stars for the look and feel."
1.0,Worst product<br />Pls don‚Äôt waste ur money.<br />The egg started leaking within few hrs.
1.0,This product is terrible
1.0,Horrible. Just horrible.
1.0,Three year old boy did not fit this.  Good luck
1.0,"Ad displayed all different designs, order came in and only 3 different designs or 6 of the same each<br /><br />Deceiving add, will never order again, need to be more explicit"
1.0,This is a very small keychain made of thin plastic with a the Michigan (M) and Maize N Blue being only a sticker. It measures 2 1/4 X 1 1/8 inch. Not big at all. Very unhappy with this item.
1.0,Dress was way too small
1.0,Ordered 3 dresses in a xl and this one was a 2 x  per sad this was the one I really like but to big .
1.0,"Beautiful piece, but doesn‚Äôt last. Too much for what seems to be cheap jewelry."
1.0,"This dress had a really weird fit!  The pockets were at my ribcage... I could hardly bend my arms enough to put my hands in the pockets.  When I went to return the dress, the shipping to send back cost nearly as much as the dress itself.  I ended up keeping it for that reason.  Complete waste of money!!  I would never buy from this company again."
1.0,Mittens arrived broken! Heating cables are completely broken off and detached from heat packs!! No warm hands here!!!
1.0,"I ordered the dress based on the positive amazon reviews. Huge disappointment!<br /><br />I pulled the Red multi dress out of the plastic bag and was shocked. I ordered a Medium and the dress was so small, short and sheer that I had to check myself. I took pictures to show what I got. The waist is a thick elastic that measures just shy of 10 inches across. At 5‚Äô5 and 125 lbs, the elastic stretched on me, but the waist was on my rib cage. It looked like an empire dress. There was no label on the dress for brand, size or washing instructions.<br /><br />I requested a refund 15 minutes after I tried it on. I heard back tonight they will refund me half the amount and I should keep the dress. I‚Äôm not holding my breath on the refund."
1.0,Judging from the positive ratings I just got a bad pair. Super cute but ripped the first time I put them on.
1.0,I wouldn't buy this if Steve Madden paid me to.  How disgraceful that they would design a bag with our flag shredded.  Disgusting.  He's got the freedom to create it & I've got the freedom to criticize it --- all because of what the flag represents.
1.0,Cheap quality . returned .
1.0,I realize that it‚Äôs past the deadline to get a refund but I bought this bracelet it back in the fall but I didn‚Äôt wear it until like mid December which it was past the deadline to send it back by the end the first time I wore it it fell apart I was so disappointed because it‚Äôs a beautifully made piece of jewelry and I was looking forward to wearing it. I Buy a lot of beans to go with my Apple Watch you can look back in the history you see how many bands I‚Äôve bought in the past but I bought a Burgundy bracelet and this particular blue bracelet  when I put the band on and went out it just fell apart the first time I wore it I was so very disappointed
1.0,One of the handles have broken already after a day. Not worth the purchase
1.0,"Just no !<br />Skip it ,<br />Recently had a baby and had me looking crazy lol<br />Immediately sent it back!"
1.0,Everything is ok but the pants r see through
1.0,"I got these because they had high ratings and were recommended by an instagram ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù but im really not understanding why the ratings were so high. These leggings are absolutely awful!! Completely see through- not remotely squat proof. The material is thin and cheap. I could see my underwear through them whilst standing straight up. Furthermore, i ordered a size medium and they fit like an xxl. Shipping cost more than the leggings to return bc they came from china so now im stuck with them. Waste of money do not buy them!"
1.0,Did not fit as expected. Wayyyy too small. It was a last minute buy so didn‚Äôt have time to buy another size.
1.0,It‚Äôs a shirt. I was looking for a nice dress!
1.0,"Horrible, the quality is very bad, the sizing is made weird. Avoid this at all cost! I am a huge Rocky fan, but the quality ruined it. I paid $60 USD and would expect the material to be a little better than this. Even if this was $10 USD the quality ruins it.  I would recommend purchasing ‚Äúofficial Rocky merchandise‚Äù at Stallone shop, it‚Äôs pricy, but at least it‚Äôs better wearable material."
1.0,Picture showed that it comes with shoulder pads. It does NOT!!! I had to cansel my bike vacation because I have no shoulder armor.
1.0,"Cute shirt, soft material bur the neck was weird. The neck hole was small and it was high. Just fit weird."
1.0,"Really unflattering, cheap, thin fabric that shows every little imperfection."
1.0,Product was too small and hard to put on. It took too long to arrive from the orient to consider exchanging it.
1.0,"I was pleased with how easily the size of the silver strap adjusted.  The look of the strap was classy - nice enough to be shown off.  I was very pleased with it, but as I was putting it on one day it fell (one of the negative consequences to the strap style) onto our carpeted floor.  It didn't work after that.  I only wore it for 1 month."
1.0,Bad quality two week and get damage. Hand wash all the time.
1.0,"The actual jacket is  cheaply made.  Photo to sell looks pretty good, but what you get does not!<br />No need to say a return was made immediately!"
1.0,"I bought 10 different silky/satin button downs from different brands on Amazon, including ones not that much more expensive than this one, and this was the only one that wasn‚Äôt wearable. The inside material is stiff and horribly scratchy. It‚Äôs also way too shiny and looks cheap. It‚Äôs one of the worst shirts I‚Äôve ever tried on. I‚Äôve never tried SHEIN before and now I understand it‚Äôs reputation."
1.0,"I had 2. Both of them broke. Had to return it. Its beautiful but not made to last more than 2 weeks, unfortunately."
1.0,This looks like I won it in a bubble gum machine please don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,Don't be fooled this is not a true Nike wallet.i was due for a replacement for my current real Nike wallet that lasted several years this made with faux leather stitching broke within 2 weeks
1.0,Product is made in China and so it must be an XL for the little women of China. Says XL fits like a medium.
1.0,Unfortunately the grips on the black tights are on the incorrect side. So when they are on  the left foot had the grips on top instead of the bottom of the foot ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1.0,One pair are the shorts I bought and the other is a replacement. Both pair has a RIP above the pocket on opposite sides and never been worn. How are you suppose to get your issue solved when no one will contact you back
1.0,"THE COLOR, THE TEXTURE, THE LEATHER, THE STITCHING. All different in the image. No, not leather...plastic. Mine doesn't feel or smell at all like leather. I am pretty certain it is not leather. Do these photos look like the same product to you? My wallet is on the left. The wallet I wanted to purchase is on the right. I would have to say I have been ripped off. I would also have to say this is false advertising. I now see so many other people complaining about the exact same issues. How in the world do they have so many good reviews? hmmmm."
1.0,Cheap and thin material. Would wrinkle at the slightest movement. Thigh area was VERY large- not flattering.
1.0,No stretch and runs small.
1.0,"This shirt is made in China.  Not only do I not want to support Chinese economy, their products ALWAYS run small.  When the origin of a product is not advertised, it's hard to know what size to purchase.  I'll probably not purchase items that I'm unsure of their origins.  Live and learn."
1.0,Very poorly fitted dress! The zip broke apart right away! Too lose at the shoulder and creates folds along the zip line at the back of the dress. So disappointed with this buy!
1.0,As soon I used and washed my hand the stone gone ;so the quality is really bad I get mad and threw it away!!!
1.0,"It is the kind of thing you'd buy in the one dollar store.  Very shabby material and it is even bruised, such is the workmanship.  It was shipped ok, and they tell you to return it if not satisfied but it isn't worth my time to return it, and so I threw it in the trash."
1.0,This thing is way to bulky and uncomfortable. I returned mine and bought one from kk&Jay.
1.0,These cracked within a few days of using them.
1.0,I had to buy another wallet cause this one fell apart on me after 2 weeks of use.
1.0,My goodness what a terrible purchase. I didnt Expect the quality to be AMAZING for $15‚Ä¶ but I would Have paid $3 for this tank. Awful
1.0,This dress is very thin and does not look like the dress in the pitcure on the website. I really did not like this item
1.0,They were good colors however they do not stay securely closed
1.0,Sucky jacket. Doesn't look like anything from the photo. And I'm an XL and ordered 3XL. Didn't fit at all. Fits like a medium.
1.0,Just got the package today! And look!
1.0,"Very narrow, and he does not have wide feet.. My husband is disabled, and they do not slip on. He can barely get his toes into them!"
1.0,"The company presented a false advertisement and deceptive practice on amazon website. And the different price range, for their product when their product was grouped and in single display"
1.0,All the tags have been cut off the back of all four garments.  The items are no longer considered new as the tags look to be deliberately removed. I am very dissatisfied with this product and I will be returning it.
1.0,The retail value they have is totally wrong. Go to the mfgr. website and see the true value of this watch. Very cheap watch.Do not buy.
1.0,"The color ddn‚Äôt look the same as the photo, also definitely was happy with the quality."
1.0,Does not fit like a regular womens size 6
1.0,"My waist is 35&#34;. I ordered 2 belts 34-36&#34; on 2/16 & I received 2 belts 30-32&#34;. So I had to return them. A week later, I ordered a 34-36&#34; same belt again. This time I received a 32-34&#34; belt. Oh my god, can you believe these?"
1.0,I love this purse but after only one month the zipper broke. I an very disappointed.  Please send a return address for me so I can return for another one because I will not pay for shipping.
1.0,These run small - too tight
1.0,Too small very upset
1.0,So small fits my son
1.0,"Took over three months to get to me when it was estimated to arrive within two weeks, and did not look as expected."
1.0,Hurt my feet so bad I had to throw them out
1.0,Disappointed with the quality.  Seams uneven.  Dress is not layered.  Contrasting fabric is a panel that is sewn in.  Hem did not hang straight.
1.0,Horrible quality looks nothing like the picture. Returning for sure
1.0,"I bought this item for my girlfriend's birthday, and it broke on the 31st day after we purchased it. I would return this item if I could because I believe that it is a manufacturer's defect. The watch was not abused and only had normal everyday use since it was purchased. Since this item lasted such a short period of time I expect that it should be replaced by the seller."
1.0,"I just received this belt, but I already feel it will not last. It bends far too easily for something that's supposed to be/mimic leather. I'll try it, but I already ordered a legit belt from Mission Belt."
1.0,Second needle was moving freely
1.0,Changed color after one week and turned my neck green
1.0,Butterfly on strap feel off within a wear or two... by the third time the entire strap broke.  Disappointed with the quality of these shoes.
1.0,it arrived broken and to return it would have cost more than the purchase price.
1.0,Suction cups are cheap and do not stick at all. DO NOT BUY!!
1.0,"Some of the strappy joints aren't connected, so I have to sew it, and I literally just got it!"
1.0,I opened the box on the day of delivery to find a pair of boots that can't be new and look like they've been worn already and have been used through a storm already.  Not impressed and if I could rate them the way I want to they get no stars
1.0,"I bought this, wore it once and the arm of the sweater came unattached from the rest of the sweater half way through my work day. So disappointed!"
1.0,Im a size womens size 10 and the 2xl was way to small. Their size chart is off.  Sending back.  Cute though.
1.0,"This knock-off feels stiff and cheap, the pleather does not have any give like it does in the photos. With the rigid leather it fits on your shoulder / under your arm akwardly and uncomfortably. Plus they ship in a plastic bag alone, so the corner of the purse was already indented and creased by the time it arrived. If it were a real Coach I'd be appalled in shipping methods alone."
1.0,Terrible. Didn‚Äôt fit and ripped so easily. Will NOT be purchasing again.
1.0,"Poor design, the metal piece that is used for adjusting size is sharp and digs into your skin. Do not recommend."
1.0,On to the next. The 2x was more like a medium
1.0,I ordered a large and had to give it to my daughter who wears a small.
1.0,Cheap material. I was so disappointed. Do not buy.
1.0,It‚Äôs a mom dress. Not above the knee. Not fitting. Picks give you a ‚Äúbelly‚Äù.
1.0,Material is so thin. definitely not jean material at all. not sizing friendly to more petite girls
1.0,I wear a size 5 shoe and could not get my foot into the shoe.  This new version of the slipper has a seam at the back of the heel that makes it too hard to get on.
1.0,I was very disappointed..not as advertised. The nylon rope is was to small..now I can't  use it as a gift.
1.0,"Seams came apart in shorts and top after 2nd wear. Not from fit, just unraveled"
1.0,"The pattern was very pretty, the material fair. I ordered a size9 for a 9 yr.old child. It was Huge! Could of fit an adult size 9-10.  The adjustable strap comes separately and is a nightmare trying to feed it through the neck opening. Very disappointed."
1.0,Was not as described! Different horrible material!Very dissapointed
1.0,These jackets are warm and I will order 2 more.
1.0,This didn't work out for me.
1.0,love the color and the material but it ran really small. My sister wears a small and since it did not fit me i gave it to her and it fit.
1.0,I am very disappointed mine just came in a clear bag no box no keychain and also the hook doesn't open it only opens a little bit  what a horrible quality it is  it's not Worth buying from the seller
1.0,Returned it because stitching was becoming undone before I even wore it
1.0,Runs small in chest and the material is itchy. So sad because I like the look of it until I put it on. They should have made it with soft tshirt material.
1.0,"Cheep, hollow, rough edges."
1.0,The jacket was too small for a large and pants was too large material was poor
1.0,It's links broke It is broken after two days of wearing I know is cheap but I thought I would get more than a couple days of wearing it.
1.0,complete fraud knockoff
1.0,"Product is nice but there‚Äôs a lot of threads that comes out of it I will not buy it again. The yard is coming loose and  the first day I got it I, put them on Not the quality I expected for $15."
1.0,Horrible horrible material can‚Äôt even wear the jacket. And you will have to send it back to China
1.0,It was great for a 3 year old
1.0,Fell apart shortly after purchase.
1.0,material very cheap... sorry
1.0,"I've never really received anything that I don't like off of amazon but this shirt was not at all what I was expecting or anything I could wear at all. The red colour was lighter/less vibrant than shown. It was such a cheap stiff stretchy material, like something you'd find in the dollar store. Definitely not worth it, and Ill be shipping it back. Im 19, 5'7, 135 pounds and ordered a small. The one good thing was that it came in on time"
1.0,Doesn't sag in back like picture. And that with my 12 yr . old trying it on.
1.0,Awful fit for women with large breast
1.0,Sizes are for babies I think
1.0,This robe runs very small.  I ordered an extra large & it barely closes.  Had to return it.
1.0,Well they fit.  As far as anti-skid they did not work.  Bought them for a family member who suffers from imbalance.  He placed them on to walk and he was like Bambi on ice.  The front and heel of the sock were not protected by anti skid.  Poor design flaw.  The mission will benefit from this purchase.  If you are looking to use these to prevent slipping while walking look elsewhere.
1.0,"I am a size 16/18,  I bought an 3XL and cannot get this past my knees.  I understand that sizing is inaccurate on items from China often,  but this was too much."
1.0,I should have known a 35.00 jacket would only merit one star.
1.0,"Look at the picture of the clothes,  not the model.  The pants are not at all fitted and look ridiculous. The shirt was similar,  but the neck hole was huge and almost went down to her belly button.  Can't even tell if it's the size i ordered since the tag and the listing are completely different."
1.0,"Quality is not good,Its look cheap quality"
1.0,"Not like the picture at all, looks too cheap.<br />I will return it back."
1.0,"Purchased these (pack of 10) and a pack of 5 Cosmos from a different vendor. They were as different as night and day. They are thin and very cheap. They feel as if they won't last one washing. The other vendor provided bands that were thicker, more absorbant. I doubt they are both from teh same manufacturer. I would not purchase these again - ever."
1.0,Product listing states leather but the band appears to be leather glued to other material. As shown in photo the so called leather is peeling off. I‚Äôm very disappointed in this item. Poor value for the money. And the band is under 2 months old!  DON‚ÄôT BUY!
1.0,No thanks I don‚Äôt use these products anymore it‚Äôs pretty bad
1.0,The glitter falls off when you are trying it on.
1.0,I waited a while for this item to arrive only to be disappointed. The dress does not reach the floor as shown in the picture. The waist falls in a different spot. The material does not hold its form as depicted. I feel I am an infamous victim to the knock-off bait and switch internet phenomenon.
1.0,"Thoroughly disappointed. Cheap material, cheaply made, just all out crap."
1.0,material and sewn parts was not good.
1.0,I ordered one of the pre-engraved necklaces and it came completely blank. Really disappointed since I had to wait so long to get it.
1.0,Es excellent. Son muy bellos Los Los zarcillos.
1.0,Need to say what say what size your models are wearing.
1.0,"this watch is awful,, the clasp is not even made to be closed so there is no way you can connect both ends to wear it.  I got this for my daughters birthday and boy was I disappointed and embarrassed .  It is made so cheaply but what really kills is that there is no way you can even wear it.. both ends do not connect.. don't waste you time with this.. no pun intended."
1.0,Ive been buying these straps in black for years. Always with 5-6 straps per pack for the $9. But this time black was out and my kid wanted gray. Paid the $9 only got 1 strap. Yes the description said one strap and i didnt see that til after but just beware... $9 is a RIP OFF for 1 strap. it was returned and all is well. But the sraps themselves are great just make sure your not paying $9 for 1 strap.
1.0,"This was just awful on me.¬† I got the cream and between the color being sheer and fabric being super thin, it was not flattering.¬† The fit was ridiculous. The sleeves were huge and ill fitting and the body was not drapey enough to match the sleeves.¬† I would never wear this."
1.0,I ordered this awesome blue polka dot scarf and got this hideous heart one instead.
1.0,this is the cheapest bracelet i have ever bought.  it dosen't tighten and the strings just got loose and it just hangs on the wrist.  would never buy again.
1.0,This boots quality is not more that Chinese stink boots
1.0,These sizes are way off. I ordered an XL and it fits like a XS but I can still wear it because the material is stretchy.
1.0,I ordered a large cheese way too big... the polyester shirt is peach not beige.  This is not what I expected.  Looks more like a thin sweatshirt.  Now I have to figure out what I‚Äôm going to do with how to style this sweatshirt.... don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,They have a huge chunk of extra material in the crotch. Can't wear them because it's so uncomfortable.
1.0,"These were a 2/10 for sure. The material is pretty uncomfortable and has zero stretch. I ordered in my usual size (M) and they didn‚Äôt stack how i thought they would. If you are going to order these, i would definitely size up because they run small."
1.0,I only had them for a month when they started falling apart. One of the screws was stripped and the lens fell out. They are super cute but now are worthless
1.0,"wrong color. ordered red, got black. was the more expensive one too."
1.0,"Ordered an XXL, but still really tight.  I returned it."
1.0,"Not at all as expected and nothing like the picture of the model. Material is like a cheap silk. Top fits okay, but the shorts are way too loose and too long. I‚Äôm usually a size 2 and I ordered the small. Definitely returning."
1.0,"Obviously the models they use for body type and size, don't have hips or a butt. Runs like 2 1/2 sizes too small, if you aren't built like a surf board."
1.0,Reminds me of a Halloween costume. Do not buy!!!!!
1.0,"The corset looked odd when tied. Dress was very uncomfortable to wear I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of it. My main issue is, I order ‚Äúdusty rose‚Äù as the rest of the bridesmaids and the dress is a brighter pink and not dusty at all. Fabric was ok but not the best quality. Dress was also bulging from the side slit and was open way to high I had to hold it closed the whole evening."
1.0,Isn't what I was expecting. Ugly and uncomfortable. It was a gift for my husband and I feel very disappointed.
1.0,Not made of the right material. Cheap plastic
1.0,The dress is a really cute style and material however I returned it because it is a. too short (I‚Äôm a 8/10 and ordered a large) and be the neck  hole is very small! Hard to get over my head and felt too tight.
1.0,"They are very light weight but have a flimsy &#34;sleeve&#34; at the end of the arm and it is not even attached, so when I went to put them on, it broke the plastic sleeve end and it now dangles from the arm. Disappointed."
1.0,This product looks like a very nice cap in the advertisement.  When you look at the insignia and patch they are sowed crooked on the cap.  The photo of this product is very misleading.
1.0,The gold was full almost brown in color. Looked bronze and it only contained one size pieces not the 3 different size as described.
1.0,Not at all what was advertised. They were advertised as breathable and organic cotton mask. They are not either of those things and they smell really strongly of chemicals.
1.0,"Even though they are for newborns, way, way, to big!"
1.0,No advantage to using these. Clumsy mode of adjustments.
1.0,Will not stay threaded into my anchor. Very disappointed. Had to constantly tighten it up. Will never buy this again.
1.0,Currently still lost in the mail.
1.0,Cheap poorly made bad purchase.
1.0,I bought these mainly for the blavk hoops. So ive worn the black hoops about 2 weeks. I now notice the black is coming off of the earrings.  Not good.
1.0,"I have two other garments by Coofandy (a jacket and a hoodie) both are size medium and both fit perfectly. So, I order this in a size medium also assuming that their sizing will be consistent across their entire line as most clothing lines are. Not even close. This thing was ENORMOUS. The sleeves alone were well over 2 inches longer on this jacket than on the other Coofandy jacket. The garment was so oversized as to be unwearable."
1.0,This arrived tangled and broken. It is also very thin like a string. Beyond disappointed
1.0,The quality was great of the frames but to small for an adult.
1.0,very cute -- until I put it on and it broke<br />I guess you get what you pay for :( so sad
1.0,Order 2 sizes up. Super small and the straps are long
1.0,I loved the way it was made but the bracelet keeps breaking so I'm not able to wear it. i hate it turned out that way cause i really do like it. Sad. Disappointed
1.0,No. Don‚Äôt even.
1.0,"This is a nice bag - nothing wrong with it. The reason I hate it and am returning it 10 minutes after I opened it is that the product description on Amazon's website is wrong. The dimensions of the purse are given as 10.5 X 7.9 X 2.5. The actual purse is 8 X 5.25 X 1.25. In regards to a purse, that's a huge difference. I'm quite disappointed with Amazon's poor attention to item details and feel my time is being wasted with having the return this item. I would never have purchased it had the dimensions been accurate as the bag is smaller than I wanted. However, if you're looking for a very small quilted handbag, this is a nice one."
1.0,Buy them in advance of your event cus they might not turn on like  ours üò°.
1.0,"Disliked the fabric and no label described content or care, listed as one size fits all, but is reall very large, sadly, I missed the return by date"
1.0,Strap was broken and the shoe cover looked nothing like the picture on package.
1.0,Terrible fit and worse texture!
1.0,When I put them on they don‚Äôt lay towards front the turn sideways so you can‚Äôt see the design
1.0,Did not like this item did not fit well weird shape
1.0,THIS looked like a bad knock off of a child's halloween costume.  beads badly sewn onto a felt backing- could be confused with a grade school craft project.
1.0,I ordered children's size thinking that they would fit like all the rest of my shoes but they are like Amazon shoes I don't even know anyone that they would fit.... lesson learned....
1.0,This product is Cheaply made. I bought it for my son and the chain broke. He cried so hard. I am perplexed - do you offer replacement or refund ?
1.0,"The watch stopped after less than two weeks.  I am returning and getting a replacement.  I like a large uncluttered watch face that is super easy to read.  This watch ticks all the boxes and is waterproof.  The band clasp is too large for my wrist and I prefer a stretch flex band .  I switched it out for a $6 band.  The watch is a rich design and is priced right.  Strongly recommend if these same features are what you are looking for. Now I will have to switch the bands between the two watches and pay another service charge.  Pretty disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I received the replacement watch and the watch band is defective.  The clasp band was never connected to the clasp.  See attached pictures.  So I received a watch on the initial shipment that died in less than two weeks and now I have received a replacement watch with a defective watch band.  It appears these watches are not quality controlled to any degree.  Also, I have not received a confirmation from the supplier that they will reimburse me for the stretch band I bought for the original watch that I had to remove and re-attach on the replacement watch.  YIKES  Nice watch but the problems are alarming."
1.0,"after purchase of socks, within 3 months socks were in garbage, numerous holes in toes and heel .never had socks self destruct in 3months, My opinion go in another direction, hard to believe these were polo socks!"
1.0,Product was way too small. Not worth returning and waiting 20 days for another one. Not the best quality but it looks nice.
1.0,Tarnished and didn't fit correctly for me. Not worth it.
1.0,Not right style/fit for me
1.0,Way too small! I sized up and it was still tight!
1.0,Maybe just maybe if I could get them on .
1.0,"I can‚Äôt pin point exactly what was wrong with it. It was not flattering at all. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 125lbs. I ordered a small. The neck was beautiful but the rest of it was not flattering. It felt too big and loose.<br />Returned it."
1.0,Thread coming out of the seems of the sleeves. The knot had a hole in it and was flipped upside down showing the inside of the shirt.
1.0,"After less than a month, worn a couple hours a week, the zipper broke."
1.0,"Wanted this from Hot Topic but they were no longer selling this, so I Ordered a large on here and got what fit like a &#34;small&#34; and wierd fabric not good quality, print faded away soon I was very disappointed because I was excited for this sweatshirt."
1.0,this item look to good to be true it was a great price for two items but the shipping has taken way too long its been over a month and I still have yet to receive it if I could just get my $4 back I would I'm giving it one star because they look pretty on the picture.
1.0,Was late and didn‚Äôt get it in time for vacation as promised...
1.0,Smaller than expected. The white fluff came off with just a very slight tug. Cheap material and horribly made!
1.0,Came ripped and also looks nothing like the color in the picture what a waste of $25! I‚Äôm so upset!
1.0,The style is pretty but the way it fits is horrible! Extra material near my under arms that looks crazy and the cleavage area is a horrible design as well. Just a big no! Will be returning this item.
1.0,"NOT a one-size fits all product!!! Product specifications led us to believe it would fit, or at least adjust up to fit an L or XL. It is so small, I will be surprised if it fits a 24A bra size. As it was so cheap, I am giving it to someone who can wear it rather than dealing with a return. Not impressed, Amazon. Not impressed."
1.0,Window closed. I would have sent it back. Very thin and cheap feeling
1.0,"The reason why I ordered this sleeveless cardigan was because I needed a pink red color to go with a multicolor pair of relaxed fit pants.  Big mistake, it was so small there was 12 inches of closer separation. I'm 5'7&#34;, 160 lbs, wear a size  L/12 and bust size 36c. This is definitely going back. Should have known better when I saw 4 reviews and the average was 2.5 stars."
1.0,Too big to fit on my fingers above the knuckles. I have to use them as regular rings.
1.0,"I really liked the idea and thought it was a great gift for myself.  Worked great for the ONE time I used it.  After the first use, I turned it off and put away.  3 weeks later, it will not take charge and turns off immediately.  Since I like the idea, I will look for another product manufacturer."
1.0,I'm a size 2/4... I ordered the large based on other reviews. It was still too small!! Sad... having to retried.
1.0,It comes shiny and pretty...<br />Will turn your neck black.
1.0,"It is a weird fit .......just a bit too large from what it is supposed to be ......and it is not a flattering shape in its design even if it DID fit well<br /><br />Next , sadly the one part is OK as far as material (fabric) goes but the black was sooooo flimsy and unflattering . It should have been same material not the thin like an almost transparent material.<br /><br />It just looked and felt deformed<br /><br />I hate to say this ..........but it is truly something i would not take for free........hello Rescue Mission<br /><br />I usually suggest one try it etc ..........but I can not..<br /><br />It looks so nice online.........but it sadly is not"
1.0,It is really cheap
1.0,The earring part came off and smaller then pictured.
1.0,"I was so excited to get these so I could just use one pair of glasses when outdoors. I am now SO disappointed. These will not work at all. The ‚Äúreading‚Äù part is too small and too low so that even when I look down to try to read something I still have to use my hand to lift them up so that the ‚Äúreading‚Äù part makes proper eye contact for reading. Otherwise, my eye hits right where the seam changes from regular to reading. So very annoying. NOPE! Won‚Äôt work."
1.0,Bad bracelet didn't last a week
1.0,The shoes were worn 2 times and the material on the shoe is peeling and I am now unable to wear them! DO NOT BUY!!!!
1.0,Returned. Arrived broken. Gold crushed. Imperfections in stone.
1.0,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Not worth the money at all. I. Bought these for my daughter she wore them about 3 times.  Glitter was constantly falling off making a mess. The sole of the both shoes came off. Never again will I buy from this brand."
1.0,"I returned these because I bought them for night driving, especially when it's raining, which reduces my vision.  These did make the oncoming headlights a yellow color instead of white, but it really didn't help with visibility.  I wore them over my prescription glasses, and I should have purchased something that wasn't wrap-around, since it brought the nose supports out too far from my face to be very effective.  The plastic stems seemed a bit uncomfortable when putting the glasses on.  I am discouraged because I had high hopes for these improving night time driving."
1.0,Product wasn't as advertised
1.0,"I did the sizing chart and everything. Super disappointed. My chest is super big but that wasn't the problem.<br /><br />It is very, very VERY cute and actually feels really high quality for how much I paid. So, only complaint is that I can't wear it."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt like wouldn‚Äôt stay on his feet
1.0,It‚Äôs only 1 anklet NOT a pair.
1.0,Wayyyy to big for kids
1.0,Color faded after one shower
1.0,Only wear it once and it was ok until I washed it. It came out covered of lint unwearable! I did not washed it with something that would release lint. This blouse attracts or creates this lint!<br />I'll return this!
1.0,I didn't even try it on and the side is ripped where I can't even sew it so it's trash now.
1.0,For the price I was disappointed I would send it back but I own a poodle and it was the only one I found there was nothing pink on it I put a toned tone to give it some ‚Äúsparkle ‚Äú on it.
1.0,Came apart in three places would be gorgeous if it was put together better
1.0,I bought these ragg wool socks as a gift.<br />If you look at the image one might notice that no wool is in those socks.<br />Sad when a honest person can't even buy wool socks with out this scurvy lot sending synthetic sock shaped s.
1.0,"Very beautiful piece and for a great price. As expected, it's not exactly like the picture but the color scheme matches and it appears to be well made. I haven't worn it yet but it does seem to be high quality and durable. It's so pretty!<br /><br />Edit: I wore this anklet about three times before the slide knot failed. The whole thing fell apart. Whoever made this did not know how to fashion the slide knot properly. It froze up and I was not able to move it at all. I would not recommend buying from this seller. They either don't know how to make a quality product or they don't care. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!"
1.0,"As I put my leg into the pants, I heard a pop.  I looked down and saw a tear across the calf.  Knowing this is a new style, I checked the left leg, then the second pair - no tears.  I wouldn't be a huge deal (again, this is the style now) but I thought if it can't hold up to me putting them on, there's no way it will hold up while bending and moving or through repeated washings.  They were returned."
1.0,The stitching around the neck of the shirt was AWFUL - the thread was all bunched up and a hotmess.
1.0,The petals fell off after a day
1.0,Looked okay at first but when opened the plastic it came it and the hat reeks of mildew.  Hopefully it handles being washed and the smell comes out.
1.0,It did not fit at all. Way to small and it crushed my books.
1.0,"Well, I ordered two identical pair, and one fit well, the other was 2-3 sizes too small, even though had same tags on it.  Gave it to my son, who was happy, lol"
1.0,Just received shoes. And one is defective. Does not change colors like the other.  Only stays one color (blue).
1.0,"Band is too small for a male‚Äôs arm. It is also very thin and will likely break with use in very little time. Needless to say, I was disappointed based on the seller‚Äôs description of product quality. I would not recommend."
1.0,I don‚Äôt like the material that the boot is made of. Not worth the price that for sure
1.0,Bought one for a friend and one for myself. Both fell apart and all of the charms are missing.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:62666368037625a89876123fe0ba0e05]] The size fit alright but they do not last. The first day there was a lot of popping and ripping as I was moving and as the week went on it only got worse till the crotch ripped open to expose the insulation. According to my log book I have clocked 57.4 hours in them. The size chart was accurate though, it fit well while it lasted"
1.0,I ordered a small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 120lbs... these came and they could be mistaken as a large.. did not fit at all.
1.0,"I returned these, very tight and when you put the ear straps on the front pulls up into your eyes."
1.0,"Dislike, photo is deceiving to what you get. Boooooooooo"
1.0,The print on this mask is super pixilated so you can‚Äôt even read half the phrases on the mask. The fabric is soft and comfortable enough but I could have gotten a soft mask just about anywhere these days. Very disappointed that the graphics are so blurred because that was the whole point of buying this specific mask. The photos on the listing are clearer than the mask itself actually is.
1.0,"Didn't fit and not what they showed in the picture, don't waste your money on this"
1.0,"I wish this would fit the Garmin Venu 2, but I haven't been able to find a band that does.  This isn't it."
1.0,It‚Äôs not what I thought it would be
1.0,"Terrible, got it today and it already broke, and looks cheap."
1.0,"Although the item is just as pretty as pictured, screwing it on is nearly impossible. Push pin is the way to go."
1.0,"My daughter is consistently looking for &#34;no show&#34; socks. We ordered these and she has worn them, however due to small size- they have all disappeared. Either by getting lost in the wash or misplaced in the locker room. These are way too small and ball up like trash. Would not order these again."
1.0,"If I could leave 0 stars I would. I will be returning this it's clearly not the item pictured. That's a large on my 12 year old. Surely the person putting the item in the bag should have felt bad.  I repeat don't bother to order this item...,üë∫üë∫üë∫üë∫"
1.0,All zippier cords pulled out ripped out were back straps attach to pack on first use
1.0,"it‚Äôs a very nice looking watch but with zero quality. the time lags behind  and the dang clasp broke, i only got to wear it for a couple hours. i didn‚Äôt expect anything great for $30 but i certainly expected more for the price."
1.0,It broke soon after I received it.
1.0,all the silver was off of this in under 2 months.
1.0,Ugly. I spent the money on this one because The picture made it look like it was sparkly. However this is an ugly piece of crap and not advertised appropriately.
1.0,one broke already after one week it came loose.
1.0,"Um. Octagon, huh? Try hexagon, please & thank you."
1.0,"Was disappointed I had to return due to the fit being larger than expected.<br />The Tree's were also quite large on shirt. Cute pattern, unfortunately didn't work out for me."
1.0,Way too big on top and way too small on the waist band.
1.0,My Wife hates it.
1.0,cast from a mold and made in China.Very deceptive picture from the actual product.
1.0,Took a chance on this case bc it has a built in screen protector. I work in the steel industry so I need something durable. This case doesn‚Äôt off much protection and the screen protector cracked as I sat around the house on my day off.
1.0,"The jacket it way too small for a 2xl. Other than being too small the jacket is beautiful, wish I could have kept it!"
1.0,So chip quality  sod sad
1.0,Purchase 2 of these for vacation memorabilia gifts. 1 had a defective chain and the box chain came out of the barrel where it was crimped. Reached out to seller and they failed to respond. Very disappointed in lack of response I am going to have to return.
1.0,"Super thin, completely seethrough! Poor quality. Do not purchase these you will regret it. Sad too, they are super cute in the picture..."
1.0,"Say 3 color, very misleading. I am returning it."
1.0,I received the hat in a bag smashed up. Who puts a hat in a bag and not a box. It was worthless so I simply threw it away as soon as I opened it. Next time think before you pack.
1.0,Very large. Doesn't fit and came with a guitar pick.
1.0,"They say if it seems to good to be true, then it probably is. The ring looks like something from a gumball machine. Very cheaply made and the stone IS NOT OPAL as it claims. I do not recommend."
1.0,"Cheap, arrived broken. Do NOT WASTE YOUR money."
1.0,they are pretty but do not stay up to wear as cuffs
1.0,IT CAME INOP AND I WAS IN  UTAH WORKING AWAY FROM HOME WHEN I UNPACKAGED IT.  I NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO RETURN IT.. GOOD PRICE IF IT WORKED THOUGH
1.0,"Not at all true to size, very small"
1.0,"Too tight , not good fabric, with no stretch in the material ."
1.0,Liked the style and fabric but would fit a 10 year old
1.0,"For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 125lbs, usually a size 2/4. These were huge around the waist."
1.0,This is the most defective and irregular pair of shoes I‚Äôve ever ordered. The left shoe fits ok while the right shoe is HUGE- dramatically sliding off my foot when walking. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt wear these to work. The shoes appear used especially the left shoe- there are many visible ridges and grooves on the top of the shoe. The right shoe is nice n smooth and new. The left shoe is visibly irregular. See photos to confirm. Returning these ASAP.
1.0,"Unless you‚Äôre under five feet tall, look elsewhere.  This dress is so short that even barefoot, there is a 4 inch gap between the dress and the ground."
1.0,"I usually LOVE Casios but I had two bad experiences in two weeks.  I bought the Illuminator first and it cracked right away so I thought I'd try the other Casio and it did the same thing - cracked right across the face.  Now, neither are water are resistance! My previous Casio lasted 10 years!  What happened?  Who is making these now?"
1.0,too tight and thin material
1.0,These are so small you would think they were for children.  Don't be fooled by the XXL size... its not an American Women's XXL  I wear an women's XL and wanted this to be loose so I ordered up a size.  Well this tiny!  It's not worth returning for the few dollars I paid.  It's going to a needy child.
1.0,"If this was true to.size I would have kept it. Fun print, lightweight but way to small."
1.0,"Shipped with missing stone.  The quality and style is not 1925 Jewelry.  Looks like they bought out very cheap, oversized, bad jewelry line.  Looks like broken clown like earrings.  So disappointed"
1.0,I ordered a 58. The shipping receipt said 58 but it was actually only 50 so no... not happy about that. The quality of the belt is good for the price but a little more attention to matching the sizes sent to that which was requested would be nice.
1.0,"**Update** 10/30/18** I didn't use this band for several weeks because of the issue with turning my wrist green, but I put some covering on it and decided to wear it. Not 5 minutes after I put it on the screws on both sides came undone simultaneously, causing it to fall off my wrist. One of the screws popped out, so now it's useless.<br /><br />I really want to like this band, but it has major flaws that make it not worth it. The bangle part that hold the fitbit is held on by a screw on each side. These screws come undone ALL the time. Within the first 48 hours (only using this band while I'm at work), both screws came undone. I luckily could tell this happened and re-secure them, which was quite difficult. As time went on, this issue became more and more persistent. Luckily, I could always notice it by the fit on my wrist and correct it before part of the screw was lost (as many other reviewers mention).<br /><br />After only a month of having this and wearing it, the bangle began turning my wrist green. I don't wear this except when I'm at work or out and don't want to use a rubber band, but the varnish wore off the back and has started to wear off the top which makes the entire metal part discolored.<br /><br />Based on the quality issues, this thing isn't worth more than $5.99...."
1.0,To difficult to read.
1.0,They are cute but very thin.
1.0,Very cheap product! It broke within a week. Contacted customer service for a refund or another product and nothing!
1.0,Much smaller Than mentioned
1.0,Thin material - small sizing - wide legs
1.0,Didn‚Äôt even get it put in and it broke
1.0,Very cute sweater but the chemical smell was so overwhelming I couldn‚Äôt stand it! Disappointed!
1.0,"This fabric looks very fuzzy and soft, but when you touch it with your fingers, you will realize that the frabic feels absolutely awful."
1.0,I like the fit and fabric but those large metal buttons rattled.
1.0,don't buy this crap. cheap fabric. and ALREADY falling apart and I just got it TODAY. definitely returning. so pissed.
1.0,"I like this because it looks like a ring but its not and it‚Äôs easier to put in then a ring, but I wore it once and two of the little gems fell out. Now it‚Äôs not cute any more. A waist of money!"
1.0,"UPDATED: The back broke off after wearing for just a few hours! Do not buy. Waste of money! I'm changed my review to 1 star.<br /><br />It's gets 2 stars because they are cute. However, when I purchased them they were with Prime 2-day shipping. They didn't come for a week. They also arrived tarnished. If you have jewelry cleaner, not a big deal. But I won't purchase again."
1.0,Used glasses! Don‚Äôt buy them!
1.0,After a week or so of wearing these they left a rash on my finger that took almost a week to go away!!  It has finally healed but has left a scar around my ring finger. No idea why it did this.
1.0,The white stays dirty. I tried everything to get it back white. No success. Even if 6 feet these pants are going to be long. But they give you a petite size jacket. Play the extrA money and get a jogger that will last.
1.0,Fabric is way to thin and see-through. I returned it
1.0,Fabric was incredibly poor quality.
1.0,"I bought a really nice, heavy sweatshirt by L A Soul for $29. L A Soul also makes a sweatshirt with fox print. I saw what looked like the same sweatshirt by Eastlife, a company in China. I ordered it and when I received it, I realized it was a cheap knock off of the L A Soul sweatshirt. It is made of thin, cheap material and the fox print is not the same. Save your money. I learned my lesson."
1.0,"This watch came without the wind button, also the other buttons were discolored and starting to corrode as if it's been sitting in a warehouse for years. Very disappointed in this purchase. Usually the LIGE watches are nice."
1.0,As soon as I got it one of them broke.<br />But it was pretty
1.0,Very small and super uncomfortable!!!! Don‚Äôt buy these!
1.0,"The size ( Large) is bigger than standard size that made me didn‚Äôt feel warm when wearing it. Another thing: after trying on about a minute, the battery dropped from 100% to 80% on my RAVPower 10000 power bank. By the way, it can only run on 2A input only."
1.0,"Misleading, 0 push up"
1.0,This material sucked
1.0,I ordered a medium they are super tiny I'm giving them to my 9 year old daughter
1.0,Awkwardly proportioned and unflattering
1.0,"this top is very cute but it is so tiny, I don't think a child could wear it.  I am 5.3 and weigh 135 - I ordered a medium and can't even get it over my head!"
1.0,The size I ordered was what was written on the piece of clothing..However it was not even close to the size that it should have been. I couldn't even say to order a size bigger or smaller for future purchasers because the size was so off. Wouldn't recommend buying from this company. I bought 2 pair and both went back.
1.0,My son wears size 10 crocs so I got him the next size up because the lined ones run small. Even the next size up fit him tighter (and pushed his heel out the back) than his size 10‚Äôs. For some reason to go from an 11 to a 12 goes from $24 to $45 on Amazon so I guess I‚Äôll be trying something else.
1.0,"This is made of a horrible, cheap poly fabric. Not cozy or soft at all, reminded me of the old flame retardant kids pajamas. I returned it."
1.0,"I'm sure it mentions it SOMEWHERE in the listing that their plastic, but not in the initial description AS IT SHOULD! Should've paid more attention, sneaky on the seller's part. Shame they feel like they have to operate that way..."
1.0,The size was wrong
1.0,Loved the fabric but it is wayyyy too small.
1.0,"Battery lasted less than a month. Materials are also that off the lowest quality, but that‚Äôs expected at this price, but the battery lasting less than a month is inexcusable."
1.0,"Sent these back cheap thin material and run very big , bottoms aren‚Äôt straight cut it‚Äôs half moon shape not my style"
1.0,This page is full of mistakes by Amazon which they have not corrected. There are actually 3 different styles here only 1 has a pocket. They all fit differently. This is not readily apparent from the page at all. BE VERY CAREFUL. It took 5 orders to get what I wanted..the photo style pictures. Amazon is completely at fault and will do nothing about it.
1.0,Turned everyones necks colors! Not cool
1.0,Don‚Äôt fit at all on ear‚Äôs
1.0,It had a big brown stain on the back of the right boot. It does not fit size either they are bigger then expected.
1.0,"Not really worth a star. I opened the package and a Pom Pom fell off. Not even 5 minutes later I put it on my daughter. Being 9 months old, she wanted it off immediately and as she went to take it off the had completely frayed half way down. Within 10 minutes of receiving my item all I had was a pile of yarn"
1.0,too long and smell nasty the smell didn't go away until four washes.
1.0,These earrings had no color at all in the center.  It was just a dull white.  I am not very happy with them.  I wouldn't recommend them.
1.0,The ‚Äúxs‚Äù was so big I‚Äôm so disappointed
1.0,frustrated!
1.0,I was getting ready for my son memorial service and the dress didnt fit over the bust area.  Beautiful Red üò™
1.0,Not at all as pictured and size was 3 times smaller than ordered and paper thin
1.0,Work out gear
1.0,But the ball fell off of the necklace
1.0,WARNING - If you notice there are a bunch of reviews where people are paid to give positive reviews for the products.
1.0,"Too tight everywhere and tiny leg holes, bound to give you an issue. Material is a bit weird as well.... but underwear is a personal thing, you might like them..."
1.0,Size is notal acurite
1.0,Too small had to return it.
1.0,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.<br />Seriously what a waste of money.<br /><br />First of all, the chain came all tangled (which is explainable) but IT WAS BROKEN also. The bottom chain which is double was broken and missing the second piece of the double chain so i had to break the other one too, so it could atleast be even.<br />Very disappointing. Will not buy ever again."
1.0,Do not waste your money - poorly made and too small
1.0,"Do not buy this product.  Size label tag in product does not match product.  Definitely not size ordered.  Definitely not product ordered.  Extremely poor quality.  Paper thin fabric.  Not as advertised.  There is a reason the back of item in picture is not photographed!  No one would buy it if back is seen.  What you see is not what you get.  If I could give -100,000k stars I would!  In order to submit this review I have to give it at least one star!  So not worth it!  So disappointed when I saw this product.  I actually cried when I took it out of the package!  Why are products like this allowed?  There should be a better screening process before products are offered to the public.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078PJHRZM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />For the record, I simply do not like returning items of any kind to any where.... Ever!  This one I had to return!  Ugh!!  Not happy at all!!!"
1.0,Nice full fan with feathers but the actual fan part is so cheap and flimsy I wasn't able to do anything with it. I felt like every time it was held it would break. Don't buy this item.
1.0,"Length is great but it's very tight around the arms and back, even though I am a large I will have to repurchase a size larger due to the costume being to small around the chest area."
1.0,This tshirt is basically made of sweater/sweatshirt material. Way too heavy to be a t-shirt. It's also huuuuuuuge. It's a no from me dog.
1.0,"Cheap looking and color is not uniform. There are several black spots around the chain and pendant, as stated by another earlier reviewer. Returned."
1.0,Is and looks pretty cheap.
1.0,Great sole but the cross Cross fabric is really cheap and can really make it uncomfortable.<br /><br />I thought maybe could wear it still but it feels pretty disappointing.
1.0,Fits smaller than expected and definitely not like the picture
1.0,Flimsy quality. Wouldn't buy this necklace again. The clasp broke after two weeks of wearing. Very disappointed.
1.0,No photo sorry but trust me the red polka dot design was cute and playful...maybe even a little too childish. Extreme Minnie Mouse vibes right away - not the look I was going for at all. Plus the fabric was really cheap and almost see through. I normally wear an 1X or XXL (with a majority being in my breast area - 40G) and ordered a size 2X to make sure there was some room for the girls. There was not. It fit nice on my body overall (except it got stuck to my butt crack with one brisk walk to mirror) but not too clingy otherwise. It was really that it had no space for my girls to safely hangout without hiking the waistline way up.
1.0,"This ring was the first item to pop in a search for aqua rings. Aqua is all I wear, and all I'll spend money on because turquoise and aqua are so calming.<br /><br />However, the sellers have purposely misrepresented the colours in this ring. They need to first LEARN what aqua looks like, because as you can see, there is not one aqua stone in it! The central stone is admittedly breathtaking in its sky blue brilliance. In the seller's photo, there are sapphire-blue and aqua/blue-green stones surrounding the central stone. But as you can see from both pictures, there are no ""emerald"" stones (yeah, they stuck THAT buzzword in the title, too!), there are no ""aqua"" stones. Just more sky blue and sapphire.<br /><br />I rarely return items, but my disappointment runs so deep with this purchase that I probably will.<br /><br />Please, learn your colour names!"
1.0,"I couldn‚Äôt wear these compression socks. They are pretty but......compression socks are so hard to get off & on, that the ones I got from the hospital with open toes were easier to put on.The nurse taught us to put a baggie over the toes, then put socks on, then slide baggie out through the open toes."
1.0,Pattern nice
1.0,the material is too stretchy and makes the patters look ugly
1.0,This must have been made for a baby dolls cause I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs all it‚Äôll fit! The 2-4 is like newborn size. So disappointed
1.0,"I know that you can not expect that much for the price of this watch, however I've bought some other watches at similar price and I have receive more for what I've paid, This watch is nothing but good look is not really functional. I reported the issue with the vendor and they were very kind they have good customer service, at least I found a solution since the watch I received was totally defective. And the when I mean poor description of the product is because in the description of this item doesn't say that the top and lower buttons are only decorative, so it may create false expectations of the watch. I cannot recommend this particular watch, however the vendor has some other good items."
1.0,Nice product shipping is lacking
1.0,"Way too small and cheap looking, much smaller than the picture online. Looks more like a kids purse, I would suggest not to waste your money unless you are buying it for a child under 10 years old."
1.0,Described as 2.0 Carats.....in reality it is the size of a 1.0 Carat.
1.0,"Could not get them on!  I had an old pair of the same size that fit fine, but the new ones are W-a-a-y too small"
1.0,My shirt can in a ziplock baggie with a post it with description of shirt. Opens the zippy to a awful smell of perfume. And than the string wasn‚Äôt even inserted into the collar. Since this is how they do business I won‚Äôt be ordering from this company again!
1.0,I was never given the option to give a personal name or number? So I canceled. Not sure why or I would have bought..
1.0,Supposed to be one size fits all.  It‚Äôs super small. Color is a pretty pink but not at all like the color in the pic. Thin & see through
1.0,"This tank is super cute in the picture, but the fabric is rayon. If it would've been in cotton or linen I would have ordered a bigger size. This one is being returned"
1.0,These turned my finger.i sent in for a refund and it take a while to get a refund
1.0,My butt cheeks show.
1.0,"Had to return, the fabric was cheap and very thin."
1.0,It feels just like a regular tank top. Smaller size wont make a difference as far as Compression goes.
1.0,I purchased this for my ten year old daughter. It fell apart within the first few weeks. Very poor quality.
1.0,Sizing is completely off I bought a medium and it fit more like a large very unflattering. Returned
1.0,Not impressed too thin and size to large
1.0,Way to big won't stay on
1.0,Not very sturdy or realistic.
1.0,Couldn't get it to magnetize to my nose
1.0,It looks like kid's toy.<br />So disappointed!
1.0,After wearing once 2 of them split at the seams. Garbage!
1.0,"These didn't work at all. They're too tight to stay correctly on your head, and the material doesn't have any ""grip"" to help keep them in place either. Gave them away."
1.0,"Beyond horrible. I take risks on low priced items quite a bit, most of the time it goes great. This one, however, no way! Cheap, awful, fabric; horrible stitching, and a very poor fit. I loved the print, if it would have been on half way decent material I would have kept it."
1.0,Will be returning this.  I wear a 3X and this fits more like a 1X.  Very disappointed.
1.0,The material is nice.  Cuts up way too much ! And is too short.  Im 6'1 . The size would have fit if was longer.
1.0,"too small to hold american bills no good in america, but material seem to be decent"
1.0,Nothing like the pic. Don't waste your time or money!!!
1.0,Looked so nice on here but when I tried it on boy was it hideous
1.0,Very hard to big just cheap and terribly made
1.0,"Very cheap quality, impossible to keep them on without use of a bobby pin or alligator clip. Would not buy again."
1.0,The pearl fell off after about six uses
1.0,super thick weird material...not a basic t-shirt material as expected or pictured
1.0,Poorly made. Unlined so fairly sheer.  Returned.
1.0,I had this case for three months when I noticed that the interior of the case was scratching my glasses. The part of the case that bends to open and close had broken and had given my lens at least five significant scratches.
1.0,"I got a microphone instead of the actual product? Something went wrong there, and I'm pretty sure I've seen another review stating something similar."
1.0,"Smaller than manufacturers, I have to use last hole on strap which comes undone all the time."
1.0,Dimensions misleading and shown as much larger than it actually is in pictures
1.0,"Broke within a hour, so cheap and terrible do not buy at all."
1.0,nothing like in this picture.. way too small and short.. do not waste your money
1.0,Socks were too thick and bulkey.  Wasted my money. Was not what I expected
1.0,I have plenty of hats from different sites.. hat came with stain on it and it was poorly stitched together as if someone in the back woods put it together.. the hat is completely off centered.. the photo looks like someone found a goat and took a horrible photo.. the hat is a fake of the real hate.. Do Not Order From This Company
1.0,I can not rate this product It was opened on Christmas and the stone was broke!!
1.0,It took along time to arrive to me almost a month. It didn't look like the picture.
1.0,"an absolutely useless product, it does not offer any protection"
1.0,Disapointed - received two left earings instead of one left and one right.  Will never wear them.  Recommend you spend a bit more to get a really nice pair that is similar but not from this seller.
1.0,I've only been wearing it 3 days and already a cz gem is missing. It was very pretty.
1.0,"The only thing about these pants that is as pictured is the print of the fabric. The waist & hips fit as expected, but the measurements of the length is not as described. The legs are not full, as pictured. I am 5‚Äô7, and the hem reaches my calf. The pants fit like cropped, flared leggings."
1.0,"it looked really cute, but when I received it it was awful"
1.0,My wife a size 7 could wear them she took them.
1.0,I had to return.  Wasn't even close to fitting.
1.0,"The style was cute. The fit was wonky it did not sit the way that it is intended in the shoulder area. Run's small, ok material.  I did receive the item pretty timely"
1.0,Not as exprcted.
1.0,This dress looked nothing like the picture. It fit like a Moo Moo and the buttons wouldn‚Äôt button.
1.0,Aweful waste of money. Bought these for my son for vacation. Wore them 1 day and the buckle ripped off. My husband superglued it back across. We made it through vacation and the next week the strap ripped completely off. Total waste of money with a very upset 7 yr old.
1.0,This is the same thing I order in the shorts and I am very sick and my mom got them for my birthday and they were horrible see through horrible fabric! So I guess you don‚Äôt get the same thing from these people! Soft amazing fabric from my diet order but I will never were these I just can‚Äôt take them back bc it‚Äôs my mom
1.0,"Broke the second time I used it. Literally broke itself upon opening it. I get that it's cheap, but that doesn't justify it breaking that easily. Buy something else."
1.0,"UPDATE: 5stars to 1star!!!  used first sunny day. Lenses are horrible. ALOT OF GLARE!!! Like these lenses are not even polarized. They turn everything yellow and do not help with sun at all. Hard to even drive with them from all the glare off cars. Will be returning. Rubber seems great so far. Very disappointed.<br /><br />So far very pleased with these! They fit great, and really good quality. I‚Äôve purchased rubber before from Oakley but got tired of paying there rediculous prices. These are a lot cheaper and just as good. USE DISH SOAP!!!! I‚Äôve never had problem getting rubber on. You want them to be tight, take your time. Next sunny day will see how good lenses are. So far I‚Äôm very happy with purchase.."
1.0,"Let me start by saying that it is extremely difficult for me to be disappointed in something that I don't spend a lot of money on. This is the exception. It broke one minute after I took it out of the package (I am not exaggerating). I didn't expect it to last forever or even for a long time, but COME ON!!! The small leather loops that are supposed to hold the wrist band down came apart when I put the watch on for the very first time. So even if I WANTED to wear it, it looks stupid because the strap sticks out. Its cool though because I wouldn't wear it even besides that. The picture is totally deceiving and leads you to believe the watch is white and silver, but in reality the silver looking part is actually gold and I wouldn't have bought it in the first place if I would have known that. Cheap looking silver is bad enough, but cheap gold is a no go for me and looks very tacky. I was very excited to get this watch and I am beyond disappointed."
1.0,Wouldn't stay connected to my watch.  Love the design but must return....
1.0,"The item for the price is VERY low quality, it had very thin fabric and didn‚Äôt fit true to size. I personally did not like it I am 5‚Äô6 wear a size 12 and got a XL and it didn‚Äôt fit good and the quality just wasn‚Äôt there. Especially, when I can go to Old Navy, American Eagles, Torrid pay the same price but better quality. Only thing is the mention stores don‚Äôt sell that style, from what I have been searching."
1.0,"Defective. It doesn't stay attached to my Fitbit if I gently pull the band when trying to put it on. Even if I could get it on, I would not trust it to keep my Fitbit on my wrist."
1.0,not functional for the 3 items i had in there. if you travel heavy don't expect it to fit.
1.0,"This t-shirt isn't a true to size fit.  You may want to order 1 size up from your normal size.  Picture is very, very poor quality.  I cannot stress enough how blurred it is."
1.0,I liked it was a gift for my nephew but was really small order two sizes up at least
1.0,"I have purchased multiples of these masks, and really enjoyed 3 of them. This one, however, came to me completely stretched out and totally useless. There‚Äôs no way to fix it that I can see. And I waited to open it to use until after the return window had closed, so now I‚Äôm stuck with it. üò°  I guess my word of advice is watch who you are purchasing from!"
1.0,It was supposedly the same size as my original watch band but the metal pieces that clip into the watch are too long/wide üòë time and money wasted these a definitely not universal bands
1.0,I would not buy this shirt again . The material was not soft .
1.0,"I purchased these for a  concert for our local Hard Rock Casino.  As people entered we passed them<br />Out.  Half if not more did not light.  Like they‚Äôd been snapped already.  I asked for a refund  , explained that people at the concert had them.  They told me to return  them.  Really?? People have them.  I do not recommend them at all."
1.0,I bought these pants 2 years ago. They are still perfect. The material is fantastic on my old pants. So I of course had to buy the same exact brand and size. I opened my package the material is thin. I am a supervisor of a large company. And these do not look like professional pants at all. They look like some cheap stretch pants. That are very thin material. Ladies we all know if you have thighs you will have the Wooly Balls in the material between your legs. I was so disappointed I never tried them on for size.
1.0,Didnt like it made me look pregnant and i'm a size 4 so...
1.0,"TOO SMALL. It's beads were the color of paly-doh, it was too small to fit my six year old cousin's hand, and was an overall disappointment."
1.0,. It‚Äôs cheaper than it looks and mine arrived broken. Not worth the money.
1.0,Worst buy on amazon ever..watch stopped working on the 1st wear and at the end of one week started fading !!!
1.0,"These earring are gray, not silver.  Disappointed."
1.0,Well I'm the dunce that didn't notice it was misspelled in the listing on the photo. But also these Christmas Pajamas say CHRISTAMS. Come on dude. And amazon.
1.0,Bad Bad Bad Very bad Product! Not buy!
1.0,"My wife‚Äôs hands are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù size and the glove itself fits, but the finger length is bizarre-literally an inch too long."
1.0,I received the wrong size and although I'm only 4'11&#34; they seem a little short when I sit down.  They are also very staticky.  The waist is very wide.  I included a picture of a can of beans next to the waist to show how wide the waist band is. Not what I expected.
1.0,If I could leave 0 stars I would. I ordered this for my sons first birthday.... I got some photo props designed after an those old western antique photos you get done at fairs...
1.0,Wish i had read review about band. Mine was also broken and it was a gift for Christmas for my daughter-in-law; embarrassing since I hadn't totally removed packaging and siscovered the beoken band. We took it to a jeweler and replaced band rather than return it because she was headed back home. Frustrating.
1.0,This was scratchy material! The one time I wore it to work out I wanted to scratch myself the entire time! It also fit a little small - liked the length
1.0,I was so disappointed because I loved the shirt but I could not fit into it at all
1.0,After 2 wears the outside lining started to peel away and the jacket is no longer serviceable. I do not recommend purchasing this. IT is cheap and you get what you pay for. Keep that in mind when buying.
1.0,I received my new briefcase and was very excited until I opened the box and the top of the briefcase was torn. No quality control I guess as this was a pretty obvious defect. The briefcase is now boxed back up and will be sent back for another one that isn't damaged or I want my money back.<br /><br />I don't expect a lot for a briefcase costing the amount this one does but at least make sure it isn't torn.
1.0,"Cheaply made, too small, but worst of all, you cannot return it without paying for the shipping to New Jersey. Even if I wanted this cheap, awful sweater in a size that would actually fit me, I wouldn't be able to exchange it without paying at least $10 for shipping. SO. NOT. WORTH IT."
1.0,Not great poor quality
1.0,"See through, cheaply made. Don't buy."
1.0,"I wanted to like the piece because it was so cute! Unfortunately when I got it in the mail, it didn't look anything like the picture and it didn't fit right. I ended up returning it."
1.0,My middle school daughter used this backpack for less than one year and it is already ripped at the seams.  Quality should be A LOT better for the price.  Very disappointed.
1.0,I gave this a one because the flower came off  when I took it out the package
1.0,"The size was fine, but there was nothing ""compression"" about it, its a very thin material that does nothing as stated in the word ""compression"" and the shirt isn't long at all either."
1.0,It broke the 3rd day. Sorry but made very cheap!
1.0,"I cannot believe Amazon allowed this supplier to pull a bait and switch.  I ordered this jacket because of the ""digital readout and new 2020 improvements"".  All lies.  The name was sewn on crooked and the battery pack (pics attached) was just a four LED generic pack.  So disappointing.  Like may others, I work where it is colder and I needed a jacket like this to stay warm outdoors.  So disappointing."
1.0,"This is incredibly disrespectful and quite assumptious. Imagine if it were to read, ""All (Insert minority group) Are Bad""."
1.0,Product has turned gold. Looks like it was plated silver. Bought this for a Christmas gift for my fianc√©. Very disappointed.
1.0,"It was not the dress in the picture, a knock off version."
1.0,The fit was fine but the material was too thin for winter.
1.0,"The size chart is rather inaccurate. The shirt was significantly shorter than sizing implied. I'm 5'1 and it fit like a crop top. And despite being a Prime, I had to pay $5.99 to return it. Never again."
1.0,These were not polarized.
1.0,"My son waited for this for well over a month! Brand of sweatshirt, color, style and even strings of hoodie completely different then shown in photo. All reasons to send back, but it also seems to be in youth sizes...did not fit my average size teenager."
1.0,Way to expensive for just a BOX and NO GAME. This seller is trying to scam. Making you think it‚Äôs the game hoping that you buy it without looking at the pictures. Trying to use a loophole this platform has.
1.0,Cotton not polyester as a bowling shirt should be and fits like a tent. Very unflattering.
1.0,"Missing a button, cool but defected"
1.0,Got one unit crest and a pack of flower seeds. Says price is per pair( meaning 2).
1.0,It was used slippers...I returned it and received full refund
1.0,Fell apart after not many wears. Cute though.
1.0,I usually wear a medium. It looked like it would be small and beside I don‚Äôt like when my nipples show. So I ordered a large. A could not get it over my head. Beside it was short. I think this was a child shirt.
1.0,zipper defect
1.0,This size chart is ridiculous. What grown woman has a 12 inch waist? Or a 15‚Äù waist yet wears a size 12? No wonder for all the returns.
1.0,"Tried the first par, one ripped and did not do the cleaning as it was showing on the ad,<br />I guess the gloves are not equipped to do this only as a protection to your hands."
1.0,The clip broke off of them so i can't use them anymore. Don't buy.
1.0,I returned this product. The fit and fabric quality were major turn offs. The fabric looked cheaper and old. Seems like the product was manufactured years back.
1.0,"Can't wear to work. Neckline goes down to to low- shows my bra. Hem line is not straight.  Center is ankle length and sides touch the ground when barefoot (I am 5'3"")."
1.0,I actually returned this item‚Ä¶ Looked very very cheap ....like a child‚Äôs play jewelry.
1.0,"not for adults, cant set date."
1.0,Garbage !!!!  Waste of your money and no help in returns !
1.0,I have lots of Homeyee dresses and I love them all . This dress is very unflattering on me . It‚Äôs too big and fabric is of low quality. I sent it back.
1.0,Very bad quality. It brokes after 2days. Very disapointed.
1.0,This is a horrible outfit for a baby. Didn‚Äôt  realize it was a crop top. Anyone putting their kid in this should be ashamed.
1.0,"This watch was listed as being water-proof....but that's nonsense. Moisture forms inside the glass, and it still runs, but I'd suggest you list it as ""a cheaply-made watch that runs for a while....and don't wear it in a moist climate. For $30+ dollars, I think I'll go back to Walmart and get a watch that won't inhale outside air to get a frosty appearance inside."
1.0,"These are not at described. They do not form to my face when I wear them but rather stay rigid and straight leaving a large gap from where they contact my face at the bridge of my nose all the way around to where the strap starts to touch my head on the back. Also, the plastic that touches your face Is hard and I can see how they would be very uncomfortable after wearing them for more than a few minutes. I will be returning them."
1.0,"When it arrived, this dress looked nothing like the picture. It was a bright pink and looked homemade and the material felt cheap. I requested a return and the option was to drop off at a UPS store which I did. Apparently my return has been lost and it has been 30 days since I returned it and  I still have not received my refund."
1.0,Awful product. Had to end up cutting belt in half due to the release getting stuck. Very disappointing. Paint also started to chip after minutes of use
1.0,To small doesn‚Äôt look how the picture makes them look. Great price but wasn‚Äôt what I wanted
1.0,fit's like a midriff after first wash and faded .
1.0,Bag ripped at shoulder straps within 2 months.  Bag was not overload ever.  Was being used for a second grader.
1.0,"Very see thru , quality of the shirt is bad didn‚Äôt see reviews on this. Leaving one now to save people from ordering this crappy cheap shirt. Will be returning"
1.0,received the wrong size item. Would not order again
1.0,"With almost no pressure from my hands, these gloves ripped at the seam at the top of the glove.  Unbelievable and must be a defective pair.  Returning."
1.0,They are cute but don‚Äôt bother. If I wasn‚Äôt immunocompromised and didn‚Äôt NEED them I would be returning them. They are not made well and have a horrible chemical smell. Sadly I NEED them to go out in public safely right now. Though they are cute...in the condition they came in I would have been better off paying for a better product.
1.0,"*Update: 1/5/22<br /><br />These cheap watches from this ""manufacturer"" are delivered running without a time stopper clip to conserve battery life. Obviously, there's no way to know how long they may have sat in inventory somewhere or how long they've been running before receipt by the purchaser. Turns out after less than two months of ownership, this watch has died. That's totally unacceptable even for a watch at this very low price point when the potential failure is so easily and cheaply preventable. For me, that alone warrants reduction of the rating from three to one star.<br /><br />*End of Update*<br /><br />Original review.<br /><br />I guess that's something. Beyond that, this is merely another issue from this watch manufacturing group. If you look around a bit, you'll find a lot of identical models with one of the other branded logos on the face but otherwise there are no differences. This Oupinke brand (OPK) has a black dial  with alternating gold tone roman numerals and batons for hour indicators. The crystal is anti-reflective mineral and the watch is represented to be water resistant to 3 ATM with lumed hands and markers. As is typical the brand logo is printed under '12' position. With approximately a 40mm diameter and weighing in at about 86g it is a decent weight for the product type but nothing remarkable.<br /><br />As far as stainless steel bracelets are concerned, referring to this one as mediocre is undeniably charitable and yet contrarily, it actually has solid end links. It is mirror polished stainless steel  which only tends to call more attention to the band's inadequacies than might be preferable.  Really, at this price point, most polished stainless steel bracelets are generally a poor choice and this one does nothing to contradict that viewpoint. That unfortunate circumstance is only made more noticeable by the addition of the yellow gold tone connector accent links bordering the  center links. It might be beneficial to change out this band to a less gaudy leather band however that would probably more than double the cost of this watch and the rest of the components just don't justify it. The bracelet employs a  stamped folding deployant clasp with double button security release.<br /><br />The crystal is encased with a polished yellow gold tone stationary bezel along with a coordinated gold tone push/pull two position crown. The day/date complication works however I did find some display alignment issues with the date window. For my preferences, the movement allows far too play in setting the time as the minute hand tends to move when the crown is pushed in.<br /><br />From a cursory examination many of these inexpensive models from each label under this group umbrella seem relatively attractive and in numerable instances the only pertinent differences are the logos on the packaging and watch dials. On closer examination - let alone under magnification - most simply fail to pass muster even with consideration to the relatively low price point.  A few do not seem to be horrible and a waste of money at any amount and some potential purchasers may consider these generally modest overall quality watches a good value. While all of them seem to employ commendably accurate lower end Japanese quartz movements which I suppose is the primary objective, nearly all of the quartz movement models I've acquired with a day/date complication are mired with misalignment issues in the date window.<br /><br />That said, I tend to believe these watches are of comparable quality to a host of popular designer branded watches employing effectively the same quality of materials but carrying substantially inflated retail prices."
1.0,"So wish I hadn‚Äôt ordered these! Need a half size bigger, but not able to return for bigger size. Not happy with this purchase."
1.0,I bought 2 sizes too big and still they where too small
1.0,"This robe is advertised as 95% cotton.<br />After receiving this robe, the label states 35% cotton‚Ä¶<br />It also says on the label that dry cleaning is recommended. Not acceptable."
1.0,waited months for the shipment and it never came - no tracking info was provided either
1.0,Sizing was way off.  Had to return it.
1.0,This was supposed to be 2XL and it was a medium.
1.0,Super cheap! Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,"WARNING!  If you have come to expect that you can try various products and easily return them if they are not to your liking, you will not hear back from this seller!  So far it has been about a month and still no word from them.  Luckily the Amazon support team is wonderful.<br /><br />This really deserves ZERO STARS, but you have to at least give it one."
1.0,Took long to get and it was broken
1.0,the dress looks nothing like the photo -hi-way robbery - too short.  Never purchase this brand again.
1.0,"the Fabric is similar to a thin cotton Towell, not a casual dress shirt."
1.0,"There is nothing positive to say, nothing at all.<br />Too small for size,  zipper didn‚Äôt work at all, and the fabric was almost paper like.  It‚Äôs Fugly"
1.0,"If you are average to above average in height this not the top for you. Also, I made the mistake of washing the tops. Let hang dry and used cold water but they still shrunk even more."
1.0,It finally snowed and my husband took out his Christmas gift.  The headset would not charge so we returned! Amazon customer service is awesome.
1.0,I ordered this for my godson and it arrived in shambles. The scepter is crushed and in pieces. The crown is poorly made. Looks like a child‚Äôs arts and crafts project. There‚Äôs glue everywhere.  Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,Cheap quality. Crooked lettering.
1.0,Terribly disappointed when I broke out with an itchy rash where the elastic was around my body.
1.0,The sizes on these are not based on USA sizing standards
1.0,Way way to small to be a shoulder pad almost to small to be a knee pad....
1.0,"I bought it, and it came in broken. I do not suggest buying this. Snaps easily"
1.0,too small wrong fit
1.0,The sizing was smaller than described. I had to send it back. It was cute but I recommend going one size up.
1.0,Only that I received it really fast
1.0,"They were cute for about 3 times worn.... then they simply crumbled to pieces. VERY flimsy metal. I saw reviews that posted the same but still took the risk.... be warned! If you are looking to were these once or twice, these are beautiful! Otherwise, pieces of garbage now."
1.0,"Terrible. The pendant looked NOTHING like what was offered. I had zero time to do anything about it, as it was a rush order and I literally had about 1 minute at the post office where it arrived to slip it out of the package and place it onto the customized chain + gemstone necklace I pieced together for a rush jewelry order that had to ship off immediately in order to arrive on time for a gift. I am SUPER DISAPPOINTED...and hope my customer understands when they receive the necklace and see that it‚Äôs nothing like what they were expecting. I would still like the piece that I ordered to be delivered...this is not right!!!"
1.0,"Wore them to work. They broke down within 2 hours.  I hot glued them together so I could make it through the work day, then they broke in other places!  Not worth the purchase."
1.0,The cut in the arms was very narrow and strange.  Returned.
1.0,No funciona üò°
1.0,i have had to go through 4 of them within a month because the ball keep falling off and will not stay on. i mean you have enough of them but still not cool
1.0,"low quality product, doesn't fit well, some bids falls."
1.0,Tore my shirt
1.0,Too large for my head. Nice material and style just didnt work for me.
1.0,Doesn't look as good as it does it the pics.
1.0,"I only liked the price - I guess you get what you pay for. It's very disproportionate so a normal-shaped woman cannot use it. Also the clasp  is too hard and poky so you have to wear underwear otherwise you can't walk! Very uncomfy, and the factory smell won't go away even after washing!"
1.0,"It was so thin! It covers nothing, you can see through it."
1.0,"Nice backpack but none of the zippers are good!  On the main pocket, the pull broke off the first time,  others will strip open in the middle without opening.  Disappointing!"
1.0,that size seems to be for an 8-year-old girl
1.0,Ordered a 3XL it was delivered two days letter tag reads 3XL but product fitted like a 1XL
1.0,"This a nice hat. Love the color. Love the embroidery. However the product description says ""Adjustable strap with hide-away buckle"".........it does not. The hat sent to me did not have the adjustable strap, which is why I bought it in the first place. The hat sent to me has something called a ""flexfit"" elastic band all the way around. It keeps it tight to my head all the time. There is no adjustment. It is uncomfortable to wear for a long period of time."
1.0,This dress is cute but way smaller than you would expect
1.0,Sizing small and fabric really thin
1.0,"The bottom is lose, cutting into my nose at the bottom and bridge of the nose too loose. Looks reaaaally bad lol"
1.0,"Do not buy this,  it will never fit"
1.0,Gold rubbed off 2 days
1.0,Arrived with a permanent kink in the retainer wire. The wire then popped out of the rubber boot 6 days after I received it. I have others that have lasted over a year. Arrived bent and didn't last a week.
1.0,My husband is a fan but after seeing how it faded he threw it away
1.0,Do not buy!!! Products is not the same as listed. The lock does not work at all and there is no headphone port. Its kind of a crappy bag. Waste of time and money.
1.0,It was small I‚Äôll fitting and itchy I hate it wish I could return I waste of money
1.0,These Jean's run extremely small. I ordered a 1X & looks like a jr size 3! Can't even wear them & I went by the sizing chart. Order up 1-2 sizes.
1.0,"Broke in shipping and even if it didn‚Äôt, it would have been way too small."
1.0,"Shoes came in bag, not a box, shoes are squished and mangled. Which would be fine, they are shoes, but the heel part is so flattened it make is almost impossible for a kid to put the shoes on. Sure there is the little loop thing to hold to keep it up but is so mashed it in no way helps. I have a difficult time helping put these on as an adult. Will not buy again.<br />Correct size though."
1.0,Bought 2sizes bigger and too small  gave it away
1.0,"They were extremely cute and lasted just under a year, which wouldn't be too bad for socks - if I hadn't packed them away with my Christmas things at the end of last year, thus only worn them about 5 or 6 times and washed/dried as instructed. Severely disappointed to have this happen. (Having the same problem as a number of other reviewers - the animal face is detached from the rest of the sock and falling apart.)"
1.0,"The umbrella came with a coupon and as per instructions, the seller was supposed to send a free umbrella fabric. The seller responded that they couldn't find the order number and never followed up on it. Probably the fabric was free initially to collect some good reviews.<br />Now the umbrella is not any different than any other similar cheap umbrella sold on amazon. The aluminum rod is equally thin and it's not very sturdy and bends a  little bit where it is connected to the base. Overall, ok quality. You get what you paid for. I do not recommend it."
1.0,"The cat peed on it, so my wife washed it in the washing machine. That completely destroyed the lining.<br /><br />Contacted the maker who suggested I buy a new one as they have improved it. The zipper on that one has broken."
1.0,I hate writing bad reviews but I don‚Äôt want someone else to make the mistake I made. $ave your money! This was sooo cheap looking!
1.0,The leather handles are good but the bag itself is not good not  leather. I felt bad when i received it.
1.0,Different from my Authentic pairs purchased in store. Low quality.
1.0,Wore this necklace for two weeks and it became tarnished. Cheap materials. Returned.
1.0,"Does not appear to be white gold plated sterling silver. Am doubting true cubic zirconium as well. Posts also arrived bent. ‚ÄúHip‚Äù advertising phrase is grammatically incorrect. This Chinese vendor needs a lesson in truth in advertising, a better translator and stricter quality control. Returning."
1.0,"In person the print looks odd. Not as expected. Not ""cool"" just weird."
1.0,"Quality is really cheap, the bow doesnt stay up like the one shown in the pictures, returning my item, not worth 18 dollars"
1.0,The straps breaks very easily. Not worth the money
1.0,Flimsy n thin material
1.0,[[VIDEOID:95c7b59e66451082d175f9fa964717d5]] I normally do not write reviews but I was so excited to get these new socks and with in hours of wearing them there is a hole Im very disappointed but I‚Äôm also not going to go through the return process I just know this will be my last time to order these
1.0,"No stamped .925 and brought to jeweler to confirm it‚Äôs not real sterling silver. Caused an immediate allergic reaction on daughters hand. Do not buy this. $20+ wasted, now to re package and get shipped back. Save your money. Beautiful ring, but not for the price for ‚Äústerling silver‚Äù"
1.0,"Guess I'm naive, but I honestly thought that these earrings would look like the picture the seller has here to represent the item that I am buying sight unseen on the internet. Silly me, what a ridiculous assumption. They arrived and looked absolutely nothing like the photo. First of all, they were much smaller than 1/2 carat, I have a pair of 1/2 carat diamonds and these were much smaller. Secondly, they had absolutely no sparkle and were loaded with inclusions. If you're looking for diamonds that actually sparkle, save you're money and look elsewhere. I ended up buying a pair of gorgeous sparkly blue diamonds on ebay from Thailand and had them mounted in white gold screw back posts at the jeweler for not much more than the price of these duds."
1.0,Nowhere close to a women's xlg. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,"Loose,cheap, and color was not what I expected."
1.0,The top portion of these socks is great the toe section not so much. The seem where the toe portion was sewn together is horrible unless you have extra large toes and it‚Äôs not a nice tight fit and it‚Äôs noticeable when you where shoes and uncomfortable
1.0,I have bought about a dozen of these tops in Medium. A true medium fits me fine. But 4 of the tops say medium on the label but they are really extra large. They were not sized properly so I have wasted over $90 on 4 tops I can't wear. I am very disappointed in the lack of quality control on sizing.
1.0,"I wore these leggings for the first time today. Within 5 minutes they were completely falling down. I am 7 months pregnant, 5‚Äô2 and ordered a small. It is so uncomfortable constantly having to pull them up! Would not recommend."
1.0,Way to big. They fit my face but did want to stay up
1.0,Sucks. I returned it. Sucks quality
1.0,"This necklace looks and feels like hard plastic NOT the beautiful blue glass that's portrayed in the photos. I'm very disappointed in this purchase as I was really looking forward to receiving this necklace. I wasted my money, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!"
1.0,Needs better packaging and the brim should be smaller like other snapbacks thus snapback is perfectly fine for taking pictures n everything but not for going out looks ugly and if you make the brim smaller n the right size it should come out better n you'll save on material hope you see my review through
1.0,"I used these twice for 1/2 hour each time to pick berries.  The back seam split near the sole so ants got in them, plus the water from the puddles.  I tried taping them back up but it split again."
1.0,The lil studs fell out of both pair before  i could even wear them
1.0,"Way to small. My son needed these for work and it's impossible to find pants a 34 or 36 inch length. I purchased them one size larger then actual size I needed and they were still at least two sizes to small. Needed a 36 waist x 36 length, ordered a 38x36, received pants with a tag saying 38x36 but we're more like a 34x34. The length could have worked nit the waist and thighs were very slim."
1.0,Beads are stained to look like celestite.  They are not real!  Color rubs off on skin.  Be warned before you buy.  This is a scam!!
1.0,"This was delivered January 24, 2019. My daughter's birthday is January 25th. I gave the necklace to her on her birthday, and the charm came out within HOURS. Don't waste your money on this trash."
1.0,El producto me encanta pero las talla est√°n mal compr√© mi talla y est√° demasiado peque√±a
1.0,This cap is made for someone with a huge head.  There is stiff material in the upper portion of the cap and it sticks up above my head.  You would have to have the weirdest shaped head to fill in the gap.
1.0,"This watch says cheap all over it! It looks and feels like gold colored plastic. Watch movements are not fine and are off center. The watch came with a banana creme colored face, not the off white more fashionable colored face like it the picture. The watch isn't heavy like other quality watches I own. Certainly not worth $40 more like $2-3 from a crackerjack box. I had reservations about buying a watch online versus in person, and now I know why - I got burned sending it back! And it came wrapped it cellophane plastic and on a plastic cushion inside the box. Did I say cheap?!"
1.0,paper thin garbage.
1.0,I bought this dress because it looks nice and elegant. When I received it I was so bummed out! I needed it that same day it arrived! The material is nice but the print and colors don't look anything like in the picture. The picture shows a dark dress with bright flowers. The actual dress in person is faded dark with light faded pink flowers. It's going back!
1.0,"These look pretty, but the quality of materials and the fit are way off.  I would have returned these, but my daughter who is a size 12 can wear them so at least I'm not out on that count.  These aren't tummy control and are sized wayyyyy off."
1.0,"Material too thin and cheap, horrible way its made, would not recommend item to anyone!"
1.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing these and noticed they were 50/50. Some loved them and some said they were very cheap glasses that they ended up throwing away. Welp...I took a chance and lost. As soon as these came in the mail I tried them on. They quality is SO BAD that they were crooked on my face and no amount of tweaking the glasses would help. The frame fit was so loose they would just fall off my face when i'd look down. I'm certainly not one to be picky, especially for this price, but.....hooooolyyy crap these suck. Luckily Amazon's return policy is AMAZING. Needless to say they will be sent back today."
1.0,"1 of the hats didn't light up at all, dead on arrival. Cute, but disappointing.  Wish I could get my money back."
1.0,"The mask arrived broken. It is clearly poorly made. Don‚Äôt bother, buyer beware"
1.0,I was not happy with this product at all. This is made of very cheap material. I doubt it holds up long at all.
1.0,I didnt like them. They seem like they weren't made right. Some are hard to close and open. Some feel like they're gonna break in half. I wouldn't recommend at all
1.0,"I was so excited to get this dress. It was bright red, perfect length. Just a smidge too big for me. Seeing the fabric, I could tell it'd shrink in the wash. So, I washed it. Pulled it out and the red is so faded its disgusting. I am so disappointed! Can't return because I washed. Can't wear it because the color has faded so terrible."
1.0,Fell apart within 3 days .. junk
1.0,"The look nice but they broke after a week. I wouldn't recommend buying these, they are real cheap and fall apart easily"
1.0,The face of the wolf is on the side of the mask. You can bearly see it. Took for ever to get
1.0,I ordered these glasses based off of the picture to replace my old pair that is the tortoise shell pair shown in the photo. I ordered it a second time assuming there was a mistake. False. Don't order these if you want the tortoise shell front piece. The sides are tortoise shell. But that's not what I wanted.
1.0,Runs very tight and the material is flimsy.  I am going to return it.  Poor quality.
1.0,The dress for like a sack! It was huge! It also isn‚Äôt the color pictured.
1.0,"My child broke out in hives face and neck after putting these goggles on for about 5 minutes. When I removed the goggles, the hives went slowly away. That is why I am positive my child is allergic to the material these goggles are made of. I would like to know if these goggles have latex in them. The manufacturer should disclose that."
1.0,Not at all what it looks like in the picture and runs small. Good luck getting a response after returning and trying to receive refund.
1.0,Shipped as scheduled. Size not accurate
1.0,"I ordered 2 sizes larger than myself, and it still was suffocating me. I don't know who makes them, but they need to learn how to measure and cut.."
1.0,Came apart after first wash.
1.0,"The folds on this are ridiculous! Other mats sometimes hold creases in them, but this thing will not for the life of me loose them. I have put in hours of ironing and days of book setting... Horrible quality..."
1.0,"Not like the photo, not nearly as detailed in design."
1.0,Arrived with magnet closure broken
1.0,Disconforme con la calidad
1.0,CHEAP! Bent as I was putting it on!
1.0,Turnt black on the second day I wore it.
1.0,More like a blouse.  VERY short for a short person!! Cannot wear like it shows in on the model.  Very sheer!!
1.0,If you are selling an item in the USA it should be marked to coincide with USA sizes.
1.0,Did not like the material it snagged on everything!
1.0,"Not good cheap, and you will lose all charms in one day."
1.0,The back of the slipper came undone at the seam.  Poor quality.  Don‚Äôt buy these.
1.0,After 5 days!!!!!<br />They give my 7 year old son blisters as well.
1.0,Smaller than the older version. My fault for not noticing the measurements.  But never thought they would change my favorite feature and the was how deep they use to be.
1.0,It smells like gas. I can not wear it. I tried washing it but no luck.
1.0,"I was excited to have these because I walk my dogs at night and I want to be seen from afar. After 2 blocks, I checked them and noticed that one was on the verge of falling off and the other had also slipped out of place a bit. I adjusted them, walked the additional 2 blocks to my house and one fell off as soon as I got to my front door. I was walking a bit on the slow side, so I know this wouldn't work for any kind of running."
1.0,This is awful and runs extremely small!!!
1.0,"Cute dress if I could buy the correct size.  Size XL was equal to size 8, womens in U.S.  They must get many returns like me."
1.0,Way too short - wish I would have trusted the reviews. Fabric is also thin and see through. Bummer because the photos made it look cute =/
1.0,Bought two parkas and within two weeks zipper is stuck on the both. It is a high price item and quality of the zipper is very poor. I can't return these parkas because they are so heavy and will require higher shipping cost.
1.0,"These sunglasses are a cheap plastic imitation version of the AO and military issue real things. I flew in the military for years and I know what I'm talking about. If you're looking for plastic costume-ware, these are fine. Otherwise, buy something real - you'll be much happier."
1.0,Way too small. Had to return. I would order up at least 1 size.
1.0,Disappointed with tank top...the color & style looked nothing like the picture. The material is thick & not very flattering.<br />I was looking for a sexy looking tank....this is far from it.<br />The picture is very misleading
1.0,"First of all, the ring pictured is NOT what you get. The ring took forever to come in and once it did it was too small. If you're going to order this product I suggest you get a size up from your original size"
1.0,I ordered based on the size guide but the top ripped at the sides when I closed the buttons. It is a nice looking top but I advise sizing up.
1.0,Dress not look as good as picture. Looks cheap
1.0,Earring post snapped off after wearing one time
1.0,Ordered my normal size and couldn't even zip the zipper at all!! Even followed the sizing chart which indicated I would be my normal size. Couldn't return as I was outside of the window for it because I preordered this for an event and didn't try it on until said event... Never again-- lesson learned!
1.0,My daughter wears a size 2.5 normal width and these were far too small.  Gave them to my niece who wears a size 2 and they were a struggle for her to put on.
1.0,I looked at size chart to make sure it wouldn‚Äôt be too small. It was still way too small once I tried it on. It‚Äôs more like a shirt rather than a dress
1.0,These were a waste of money. My son was 7 weeks old and we bought these for him to wear during an event. He is not a big baby and they squeezed his head to the point where he just cried when we put them on him. These did not adjust like we hoped. So I ended up missing chunks of the event because he simply couldn't wear them. So frustrating! I would never recommend these to a friend.
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy this. It looks like a night gown. I was extremely disappointed
1.0,It‚Äôs not as wide as it states and it bends so easily. Waste of money.
1.0,Small youth hat?
1.0,"Hated the fit of the dress.  It was not a maxi dress and it was tight in every area, waist, hips and bust and it was above the ankles.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"This bra could have been pretty good except that the straps are so short, even adjusted to the longest length, that my 5 foot 3 inch self cannot wear it!  I ordered size 36 (all of the band sizes are B cup) because the description said to order up.  On the tightest hook, it was still a little too loose.  I normally wear 32c on the loosest hook.  I would try 34, but the strap problem is deal breaker.  Back they go!  The black color fit a little more snug in the band than the nude.  The fabric reminds me of the Knixwear sort of rubbery elastic bras.  Also, the very large hooks are difficult to undo; they are like the hooks you find on bathing suits."
1.0,The product did not fit her at all.  The material had no give.  It did not work well for gymnastics.
1.0,Wasn't what I thought also took 12 days to get it so sad I was under prime but it took 12 days 12 days so so sad Amazon fail
1.0,Really cute until the the pearl broke off.
1.0,"I know the description of this product says it's long...and it doesn't look that long in the pic but it's  too long for me and I am almost 6 feet tall, (warning) it also has these awkward pockets that stick out, it gives you a matronly look, I'm sending it back."
1.0,Love the watch but the battery was dead when I received it. Had to go to jewelers to have battery replaced
1.0,Not the same dress as in the picture.
1.0,This picture shows a nice long item. It is about 12 inches shorter.
1.0,Shoe was small and very narrow.  The closure on it is very awkward as well
1.0,Home made junk! There not from a actual manufacturer it's someone making these at home and out of some old used spandex. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Well I am horrified i gave this to my daughter for her bithday and she was very excted, BUT it is what small and 5 inches to short, i followed the size chart and the tears that she cried saying that she is so fat infuriated me.  I want a refund and I'm hoping to hear from someone who can insure that this will be made right."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:3c6d1f20250aa028932bd0f229e00b22]] So beautiful, looks much better in person.<br /><br />Update I've lost 2 diamonds then the link just fell apart. Do not recommend!"
1.0,I ordered this set for a special occasion. The color was supposed to be purple but it looks like black. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the purple paisley set.
1.0,Unfortunately I did not receive the item that is in the picture. I wish I did as I really liked it. Unfortunately all I got was a long sleeve turtleneck T-shirt. And the style was not the same as the photo as well.
1.0,The headline says it all: this mask was a complete waste of money--any KN95 offers more room (and air) to sing.
1.0,I wore these for 20 minutes before they had multiple holes in them. Returning them...
1.0,I love the color but the design wasn‚Äôt the same it was just some added ruffle that was so wide apart not cool
1.0,"The color is not as it appears. The actual product seems more Clownish colors and cheap. Plus, the company has No return Policy on this item that I did not know. :0("
1.0,A only purchase faux leather. Comparatively not good quality. No zipper which I should have looked at description closer.<br />Not impressed...returned w/o charge ...so that's ok....
1.0,poor quality!1!!!!!! sent them back
1.0,Broken before I even got to wear - too bad because it was super cute.
1.0,The pant and jacket are paper thin I think you would get more protection using a trash bag with cutouts in it for your arms and head. I guess it's a one time use kind of set up because I cannot see this pant and jacket lasting more than one use in rainy/windy weather. Save your money and look elsewhere.
1.0,My diamonds fell out with in a day of wearing. Totally disappointed. It is beautiful just terribly made. Don't suggest it for you.
1.0,"Very poor build quality!  Only have had this purse since Aug 2018, so only 7 months. Not used every day, and still outside zipper broke!! The water bottle holders on the outside are too narrow to hold even a small water bottle!!"
1.0,The leather is good quality and the buckle is nice and chunky. I am returning mine due to the buckle screw came in stripped. This is the second strap I have to return. The one star rating is mainly for the seller since both returns are due to quality control. Very unhappy with the product due to them. The photo is of a 22mm I ordered that was 21mm on one end and 22mm on the other. Unacceptable.
1.0,"Product was much bigger than expected and the charm holder was not on the top like pictured, it was actually on the back of the wings and hit right in the chest when wearing a. Would not recommend to any one."
1.0,Absolutely horrible quality.
1.0,The second I put them on one of the seams by the pocket came out. They fit on the legs but not on the stomach. They fall down all day
1.0,"Supposedly a Men's large but they are maybe a large toddler sized. I order up a size knowing since they're from Asia, sizing is off, but this would by way off by Asian standards."
1.0,I am a medium. This was way to tight. Elastic band is not a drawstring  cannot loosen or tighten not true to size. I love the material and will re-purchase a larger size.
1.0,Not happy. The socks I received are different. Look nothing like the picture. I was very excited about these. The ones I got were white blue red.....I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased had I known that
1.0,"Disappointed.  Dress is not long enough, 3-4 inches off the ground. I am 38-31-40, just under 5'11"" and the Large fit is not flattering. Feels too big and too short.  Big problem is the material... it is thick and has no flow or movement, it just hangs there and not in a flattering way. The ""v"" cuts are not as deep as in the photo. The straps are much wider and bulkier than in photo.. If you were getting it as a lounge-around-the-house moo-moo then I'd say it's perfect for that. For $30, I am returning."
1.0,These are NOT a 3XL
1.0,Not even close to the color. Rug material. Just so disappointed. Nothing like the picture. The collar was thin unlike what‚Äôs advertised. Just bad all around.
1.0,"Item was listed as 3x, but it was more like a regular large."
1.0,Light doesnt work
1.0,Poor quality. The shoes teared up after only one use.
1.0,"The necklace that arrived was NOT a box chain, it was a little cheap looking chain that made the whole necklace look cheap."
1.0,"missing the strap, too small"
1.0,Wish the quality was better
1.0,Terrible quality. Flower bow on front broke upon first use.
1.0,Several of the charms broke off the part that pops into the hole. So mad it was some of her favorites.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:31c2cb8644107f1ba7037134c6c661f8]] Looks cheap very see thru material.  Wrinkled looks like someone returned it.
1.0,"Looked great upon arrival for my son's birthday. Moderately easy to set and worked well for about a week. Then band fell off out of the blue. I was there and my son wasn't being rough or anything. The pins that link into the main body are sunk into plastic. The plastic wore through and the band slipped off. Tried to put the pins back in and yes, it held for another day but honestly there's now way to fix the link point in the main body of the watch. Disappointing for my son. We are still looking for a replacement."
1.0,These are very cheap sheets of plastic. Worthless
1.0,If I could not give a star at all I would. This product is garbage. Do not your money.
1.0,"Ordered the ring, waited over a month for it to arrive and  it broke within 3 days of having it. Only paid three dollars and some change for it but clearly i still over paid! Had to give it a star just so my review would submit but wish there was an option of giving negative stars."
1.0,The material was AWFUL.
1.0,"Super tiny, arrived late and broken. Returned immediately."
1.0,hoodie is a nice fleece. but it took way to long to come in for it to not be the right size. i just gave it to my younger brother instead
1.0,Dress dont flare at the end
1.0,This is a deceiving product what we got and what it looks like are not the same. It‚Äôs a black hat with what looks like a clear sticker on the hat.
1.0,Not exactly pleased with this product Veyron real small and did not say that in their ad
1.0,Used it twice and one speaker already doesn't work!
1.0,Returned. The earrings would not stay closed.
1.0,"I bought these for my daughter and best friend, and they quickly broke. Also, they are not magnetic!"
1.0,"This ring looks beautiful. However, I don‚Äôt believe it is Rhodium plated or the plating is unbelievably thin. I have worn this ring three times to work at a desk job and it is already tarnished and turning my finger green. I have removed it every time I‚Äôve washed my hands or applied any lotion. I have several Rhodium plated rings and none of of them have ever turned my finger green or tarnished like this. Very disappointed because the ring looks beautiful and has such good reviews."
1.0,I am giving these a 1 star only because I had to put something in the spot.
1.0,These socks are a joke.  Not as advertised.  See photo.
1.0,"There's no way to sugar coat it and no justification for making a swimsuit that is freakin' see through when wet (I bought the sky blue color which is pretty).  Good thing I was in my backyard pool because if this had been somewhere else I would have frightened people with my ridiculous see through swimsuit.  Upstairs was okay because there's soft padding, down stairs is no bueno."
1.0,Worn once and got a quarter sized hole in them. Very poor quality not worth the money.
1.0,Broke 3 days after delivery.
1.0,"It was slow to arrive, not the same style pictured, and also not the same color pink as in the images. If you want a basic, light bubble gum pink sweatshirt, it will work, but if you‚Äôre looking for the actual sweatshirt in the pictures, look elsewhere!"
1.0,Very cheaply made. The label states they are 2.00 magnification but I had to hold a book almost to my nose to see the print. I have an expensive magnifying glass you hold in your hand and you can read perfectly with book several inches from nose. They are 2.00 magnification also. Very disappointed but not worth paying to return them. Very flimsy also.
1.0,This really is not stainless steel. The finish on this item was wearing off within a week.
1.0,"They are the worst shoes I have ever purchased. There is no structure to the shoe, it is floppy, saggy and not a shoe that would provide sturdiness to your feet  let alone comfort."
1.0,Sandals were very comfortable at first but inner sole broke down very quickly.
1.0,Didn't fit. Waaaayy too small
1.0,This visor is def. made of cheap materials and looks cheap. I doubt I will ever wear it. And I paid 15 bucks for it. I feel ripped off.
1.0,"Do not order if you might return!!!!  Although this is a ""Prime"" item, guaranteed free shipping and returns, you have to ship to Quanzhou Fijian, with you paying for the shipping (they claim you'll be reimbursed).  Who knows how long that will take to get refund and shipping costs from another country!!!"
1.0,Quality Cheap as price
1.0,Letters fell off after first wash
1.0,"I ordered and watch didn't work.  Contacted seller they mailed out another one.  It didn't work.  I contacted the seller again, they mailed me batteries for the watch, and the battery did not fit the watch.  I went out and bought batteries to fit and watch still did not work.  Cute watch, hate that it did not work:("
1.0,"The image appears to be deliberately deceptive.  I THOUGHT I was getting a quart size container of the oil.  What arrived was 1/4 of that (8 oz).  Why would I buy 8oz, when I can get four times as much for twice the price?"
1.0,"Its not universal, so i cant even use it"
1.0,fits well but such poor quality. Holes are starting to form in various places.
1.0,"The dress is nice, but it looks unfinished on the arm holes! This just damage the dress!"
1.0,"I went by the size chart it says and it is WAY to big, also it is WAY shorter then the picture shows it to be... I am not happy with this product maybe if i had one that fit correct I would be more satisfied."
1.0,"Ok , so this kimono is aesthetically pleasing . The material is soft. However it is poorly made. The robe became undone at the seems bu the first day of wearing it."
1.0,Bought this for my daughter it was only a watch band. Very disappointed couldn't give no star
1.0,Cheap and was not worth the money I paid.
1.0,"The picture shows a nice silver zipper with pull tab.  Not what you will receive!  You will get a cheaply made top with a cheap copper zipper (no pull tab) and copper studs. and make sure you size up at least 2 sizes, sizing up one for me wasn't enough. I will be returning it!"
1.0,So small. Click didn't fit my size small daughter. Never will by from them again.
1.0,"Straight out of the box the time is wrong. When the hour hand points at 12, the minute hand points at 6! It boggles the mind. Is there a way to fix that? It appears that the hour hand is off by 30 minutes relative to the minute hand. Otherwise appears work."
1.0,"The pleats in the bust were all messed up.  I tried taking it to a professional cleaners for pressing to fix the problem... they tried 3 times and were unable to get the pleats to lay flat.  Now I have missed the return date, I should have just sent it back right away.  Now I am stuck with a dress that I CAN NOT wear.  I would not recommend this dress to anyone."
1.0,Purchased this item little under 2 years ago under the expectation that it was a leather belt. as you can see in the pictures attached it's just vinyl or a faux leather. Lasted a year and a half so I'm okay with that I just wanted people to know that they weren't buying leather belts
1.0,Item arrived stained and it was a short return window.
1.0,Runs too small for US
1.0,I bought and think I could have found something just as good at the dollar store.  Very cheap.  I had to pay return shipping!  Wish I wouldn't have taken the chance.
1.0,"This dress is see through! I bought the white dress with the blue flowers and it is see through. Also, if you have a long torso (like me) the dress will fit like a maternity dress. It was not flattering at all."
1.0,Absolutely worst shirt ever! The sleeves are too tight and the seller didn‚Äôt want to accept a return! They tried offering me a deal to keep something that doesn‚Äôt even fit me! Do not buy from them! Horrible!
1.0,Way too large for kids. Very disappointed
1.0,Very disappointed in the condition of the item. It arrived broken and the bottle had spilled all over the inside of the travel box.
1.0,Wore then for 5 minutes before the mirror finish smudged off. Very disappointing
1.0,I needed it to be blue. It‚Äôs so pale it looks white. I wound up ordering g something else. The picture does not look like what I received.
1.0,I didn‚Äôt like the quality so I returned them.
1.0,"If you want a nice looking shirt that has a hole in it, this is a great buy."
1.0,They were horrible you sent me the wrong size and you wouldn't do anything about it it's okay now I don't have to wear them anymore so I'm not worried about it
1.0,"The metal discolored very quickly, awful quality"
1.0,It doesn‚Äôt stay in one position. So I‚Äôm constantly adjusting it to make sure it doesn‚Äôt slide off my wrist. Very disappointed because the look is cute
1.0,This was a gift for my sister. The crystal ball was already off one of the earrings when it arrived. Very disappointed!
1.0,I expected the piece to be special but it came in a plastic baggy and it look thin (tinny) and cheap! Of course I promptly returned it!
1.0,Poor quality. arrived torn. Returning.
1.0,The bra is much smaller than described and the cups make the bra very unappealing under clothing.
1.0,"I got these goggles to cover my glasses so when I work outside (especially on windy days) all the pollen I‚Äôm allergic to won‚Äôt get into my eyes. These do NOT cover my glasses and if I squish them down harder to my face, the pressure is extremely uncomfortable. I‚Äôm very disappointed. This isn‚Äôt what they are advertised for, but they still don‚Äôt work as promised. Otherwise they would have been nice."
1.0,These are adorable but one set didn‚Äôt work at all and another only one ear worked. A third set only had one more for the lights. Disappointing.
1.0,It was either defected or the poorly translated instructions were impossible to follow. I had to return it.
1.0,"AFTER 9 MONTHS, THREE SERIOUS RELIABILITY DEFECTS:<br /><br />1. UNRELIABLE TIME KEEPING:<br />Even with a new battery, the watch loses time randomly, unpredictably, losing 10-15 minutes perhaps 3 times in a month. I had a jeweler replace the battery; he said the original battery was weak. No improvement.<br /><br />2.  UNRELIABLE STRUCTURAL DEFECT:<br />One end of the pin that retains the band into the watch case regularly pops out. It can be reinserted using a thin metal tool, but, before you know it, it's popped out again. It's a wonder the pin did not fall out. See photo.<br /><br />3.  UNRELIABLE BAND CLASP:<br />The metal band clasp has turned out to be an weak & crummy design; the clasp spontaneously springs open perhaps 3 times weekly, whereas my former watch band never popped open. See photos.<br /><br />I have ordered a cheap Casio to replace this watch, as I must have a dependable timekeeper, tritium or not.<br /><br />I noticed that Amazon assurion provides a 2 year warranty for this watch, but it's repair/replace/refund at their discretion. Well, I don't want anything but refund. We'll see.<br /><br />====================<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this tritium illuminated watch to replace an essentially similar watch, different brand, about 7.5 years old, because the old one was occasionally losing time, even with new batteries.<br />I am a big fan of tritium illumination - no buttons to push to read watch in the dark, no fading after a few minutes as with luminescent watches.<br />The packaging was a bit over-the-top:<br />- the entire watch was wrapped in thick Saran wrap that was difficult to remove<br />- the photo models in the packaging were corny in my opinion (male model in macho pose)<br />- the package included a credit-type card  with an embossed number that says in several languages that I have a one-year warranty.<br />But on the whole, attention to thorough packaging looks, to me, like this is a company that cares about doing things thoroughly.<br />I did not weigh it, but it feels heavier than my old similar watch. Ok, I just weighed them: old one 3.6 oz, this one 4.5 oz. But it does not feel particularly heavy when worn.<br />The band clasp was a different mechanical style, but it's remained closed for a week or so, so far.<br />The link pins were difficult to press out; I finally gave up and removed some adjacent links; I had to remove two links.<br />The tritium tubes are quite bright compared to my aging watch, as expected; my 7.5 year old watch was still plenty bright.<br />After only about a week, recommended."
1.0,Chain broke coming out of box. Shipping was slow!!
1.0,"Pretty little necklace but the chain broke when I was taking it out of the package The chain is not very sturdy, you need to put a better chain on it. I will not buy it again."
1.0,"Disappointed with the medal.<br />1. The lapel pin was bent and low quality<br />2. The medal appears to be plastic and is disproportionate.<br />3. The display case is very cheaply made.<br />Very disappointed in this purchase. I was very excited to get this set for my dad, still have it to him, but I know, and so does he, the quality is very poor."
1.0,"On  receipt of this suit if found it to be a good fit, nice looking, appeared to be well made.  Hard to find a pretty blouson top, so I was glad to find this one!<br />However:  I received this suit on May 2nd.  As of today, July 2nd, I have worn it 18 times for a 1 hour water aerobics class 2 times/ week.  This is in an indoor saltwater pool, and I have not exposed this suit to sunlight at all.  It has been washed after each wearing with mild detergent in tap cold water and hung indoors in a windowless laundry room to dry.  It has completely deteriorated.  I don't believe it's fit to wear another time.  I have worn only the top, as I had a black and white swim trunk from another manufacturer that I liked with it.  It is still in perfect shape."
1.0,Quality was ok but shoulders and length way too big. Looking to gift it to a tall friend.
1.0,Product was set of 5 but I only received two pieces other three were missing. Waste of time and money.
1.0,Strap is itchy.
1.0,Love these pants. Very comfortable<br />UPDATE.  I washed these and they came apart at the seams. Very disappointed as I bought in black and loved them. The navy ones were awful.
1.0,Badly sewn. The lace in the blouse that I received was dark green like the picture and the actually blouse is a sage green. The lace is not sewn straight. Look bad.
1.0,Runs incredibly big fabric is see through. I‚Äôm 115 lbs 5‚Äô and I was swimming in the smallest size
1.0,"this watch won't run - I'm returning it for a refund - I don't know if it's a dead battery or what, but I'm not buying a new battery for a new watch or a watch that might be broken - also the plastic case it came in was cracked in several places which makes me think the watch might of been damaged - a third thing that had me wondering was that model number of the watch wasn't among all the model numbers listed on the info sheet that came with it which makes me think (although I honestly can't say for sure) that it might be a discontinued model ---"
1.0,Can‚Äôt stand how the bow is separate.  On top of that?  The strap that came with it is defective!!! He left side keep coming off from hat!  üëéüëé
1.0,terrible fit and aweful comfort. dont buy
1.0,Fits supper small
1.0,"The design was cool, but I hated the way the fabric felt on me."
1.0,waste of money. just go buy some fabric and call it a day.
1.0,"What you see in the advisement it's different than the actual package, it only had 2 heating locations (the neck and upper back,i tested with my thermal camera)Total scam!!!!"
1.0,Terrible dress! Barely held together at the seams. Strings coming out of it everywhere. Would fall apart just by looking at it too hard. Material is paper thin and transparent. Returned.
1.0,It was just UGLY. Especially the knit fabric.
1.0,The deer is VERY small
1.0,I have similar ones that are much better; these just looked weird and obvious in my bathing suit
1.0,So shocked to the size too tiny.
1.0,Poor quality and pungent smell. And very difficult to return. This is the worst experience at Amazon. I threw it into thrush bin.
1.0,Bought larger size just in case and still too short in the arms. Nowhere near as cute as the photo. I'm so disappointed.
1.0,Poor quality the tiny little orange stone are fall out. Looks terrible. Very disappointed.
1.0,I bought these because I suffer with edema in my ankles.  These socks did not help it one bit.  They are comfortable tho.
1.0,I ordered 5 sets of 50 but received 5 sets of 10 masks. Waited a long time & received 1/5 of what I paid for. Very disappointed
1.0,Product looks nothing like depicted! It looks The  color is NOTHING like shown. It looks like a cheap grey sweatshirt.
1.0,Do not waste your money!
1.0,"As I write this, I‚Äôm holding a warm rag onto my ear. I had four of these in (2 on each ear). I got two off this morning with great difficulty. The other, required some kind of pliers to remove. No joke. I have one more earring completely stuck in my ear. It‚Äôs red, hurts, and is swollen. Not even pliers are getting off that stupid rubber piece that caps off the sharp end of the earring from stabbing your neck. Some reaction of the silver caused something like rust to form in the rubber piece and it has become hard as rock. I can‚Äôt get this earring out!"
1.0,"These goggles were clearly not designed to fit a human head. If you want UV protection for your forehead while having black padding shoved into your eyes, then go for it."
1.0,The top arrived with no bottom. Had to return since the item was no longer available. I ordered up a size on the top but it was still way too small.
1.0,Too small even though it's large size.  Might try an extra large.
1.0,"This bra is very uncomfortable and not flattering. It cuts into the arm pits and comes fairly high on the chest. The straps are really short too, I had to adjust them to the max and its still tight."
1.0,FALLS APART AFTER A SINGLE USE!
1.0,The graphic of the black/white silhouette mask is WAYYYYYYY too big. Great if you‚Äôre an alien with an abnormally large head. Bad for us humans.
1.0,"Masks are too tight (or don't have enough stretch), will not fit well over the nose while under the chin, causing a big fold to form parallel to your mouth."
1.0,Shirt is actually yellow and Navy blue runs a size small
1.0,"I ordered S, i got S who is way too big, my friend who is size M tried it it was big for her too, I'm guessing ur size S is actually L, I do understand most of people are big, but still it should match ur size chart, not the fact that most if the people are fat so let's make sizes bigger...."
1.0,Necklace broke within 5 minutes of me wearing it. The chain link just broke and the necklace came undone. I wasn‚Äôt even pulling at it or anything! I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,"Awful quality, awful sizing, awful cut very misshapen. I WANTED and tried to like it cause I hate returning to amazon its so much work."
1.0,"Not what I expected, very cheap material!!"
1.0,"I purchased one of these hats at Walgreens and really liked it. I bought this one on Amazon because I thought it was identical to mine. Same color, same brand, same name, everything same except my original hat had the name embroidered on the front and fit perfectly. This one from Amazon is missing the emblem and is too small. I can‚Äôt wear it and the friend I got it for couldn‚Äôt wear it so I gave him my original one and I‚Äôm stuck with the one that‚Äôs too small. I tried getting it wet and wearing it but it didn‚Äôt help. Disappointing."
1.0,"Material not as described. Very ill fitting, too loose. Very disappointed I wanted to wear this to a dinner party and it is the same material as pajamas plus the color is not accurate to the picture. Save your money and time. Will upload picture later for unfortunate evidence"
1.0,Looked great but washed it once and the bottoms tore.
1.0,"They sent the wrong size. With that being said, the clothes fit too small. The clothes also do not look as advertised (much lower quality)."
1.0,"Muy mala calidad, al poco tiempo de uso, la hebilla se pel√≥ o perdi√≥ su pintura"
1.0,Too damn small even the large was small and I do wear small/ medium.<br />Don‚Äôt bother !
1.0,My wife says it's very cheaply made.
1.0,I loved the other 2 sweaters I got..so I ordered the orange apricot color..a completely different sweater with a chest pocket arrived instead of what I ordered.
1.0,"I initially purchased these in large, and they fit fine except the under pants were a bit too loose. So I sized down to a Med. But waist band was extremely tight leaving marks on my skin after just few min. Sizing is completely off."
1.0,Pants were nice enough material but were way too long and too small to be a size 2X.  I had to return them.
1.0,"They look cool on, but you can barely see out of them. They are too dark and you feel like you are looking through a screen."
1.0,Im a 36DD and they did not fit had to return. If you're busty probably wont work sorry ladies.
1.0,Super bummed about these...the description says they fit as expected. I ordered a size XXXL and they're the equivalent of a size 6 women's. If that's a XXXL I've got some serious work to do to get in shape.
1.0,"Let me start off with the fact that I purchased these for my Mom, who was looking for inexpensive, yet elegant, dangly earrings. She‚Äôs a petite woman, 78, and from the photo these look to be exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />Here‚Äôs my problem - I didn‚Äôt get the earrings that were in the photo. I have two identical pairs of two sets of earrings; the set that was supposed to be light blue is dark blue and look worn out - and not in a vintage, antique way; there are two pair of gray, when one should be pink; and the pearl pair looks like something my dead grandmother wouldn‚Äôt be...well, caught dead in.<br /><br />I have purchased plenty of inexpensive jewelry from Amazon and been very pleased. What looked like petite and elegant in the photo looks garish and costumey in RL. I am very disappointed."
1.0,It‚Äôs very flimsy. Would not recommend.
1.0,all glued beads fell off before i took it out of the box.
1.0,Cute slippers but weird fitting. They consistently slide to the side while walking in them. They also have 0 grip on the bottom of them. Not a fan of these at all.
1.0,Crazy small and terribly cheap.
1.0,I kept a thin white puffed jacket over this one. It flared out at the bottom and was unflattering.
1.0,Scuffed immediately and doesn't come off.
1.0,The first time I put it on the zipper broke.  I was stuck out in public for all most 2 hours with the zipper pinching me the whole time. Also for the Overall Rating it should be NO STARS.
1.0,Would give zero stars if I could. It came broken. Was super cheap.
1.0,See through....
1.0,Compre el art√≠culo dos cecea primero porq el zapato muy peque√±o compro un n√∫mero m√°s y despu√©s la tira muy suelta.
1.0,"Waist was a bit tight, which is fine whatever. That changes with wearing them. But the length on this is absolutely ridiculous short. I‚Äôm not a big. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô10‚Äù, and these things fit like a pair of capris. Just horrible short."
1.0,This pullover is nothing like the picture. I was expecting a chunky cable sweater. What I got was a flat no raised knit sweater. The color was not the same as the picture that I ordered. Definitely will not be wearing it
1.0,"It's not a slim fit, it fits fat"
1.0,"I asked for a very much larger size for my son and it runs Very snug when buttoned up and is too tight, he is just 6 ft 4 and a big man who works out."
1.0,"Mala calidad. Pedi 150 y aunque este marcado, el tama√±o real era de 120. Malisima calidad. No recomiendo este vendedor."
1.0,Three bands were broken and received 2 light blue.
1.0,Had no support and didn't fit correctly. Returned.
1.0,Both earrings are broken.
1.0,Item was huge and fabric was so sheer. Felt flimsy and cheap so I returned it without any problem.
1.0,Just got these today and was looking forward to using them but when I put them on they were too small and very tight on my fingers.  These are not one size fits all and I will be returning these.
1.0,Ladies this item came in packaged nicely one wash and the inner stitching came apart and ravelled out. Horrible and all stretched out.<br />Do not buy poorly made!
1.0,"1 star isn‚Äôt low enough. The ‚Äúblack ceramic‚Äù is what I‚Äôm assuming is anodized aluminum. I spent hours prepping an antler inlay to precisely fill the groove, inlaid turquoise and amethyst, began turning, only to realize the black easily rubbed away. This is 100% NOT black ceramic. Not only did the color wear away, the cheap metal ground away just as fast as the black coating, leaving an uneven bevel.  What a waste of time, effort, materials and $. This company will never again get my $."
1.0,Don't buy these. I could even get my foot in it. It's an extremely narrow opening and I couldn't even get my foot in
1.0,"Terrible! The fans don‚Äôt operate at all, tried multiple sets of new batteries, so it won‚Äôt inflate. One controller began to work and then stopped.<br /><br />Zero stars.<br /><br />And no option to return as the return window closed before I discovered it will not inflate. Really displeased!"
1.0,"not like the picture, very very small."
1.0,Its beautiful but Its already broken....:-( I've had less than a week.
1.0,This product was supposed to be a 4X and is smaller then my XL. And to get a refund you have to send it back to the manufacturer not just an Amazon location. Sooooo disappointed!
1.0,Would never allow date to be set.  Was too large to qualify as female. Only time was settable.
1.0,"I waited almost a month for these to arrive. The printing is really crappy, it looks really terrible and the bandana ""print"" is actually blurry. It also looks faded and isn't black. I'll be throwing these right in the trash. So annoying since i waited so long, I would've just bought something else."
1.0,It says waterproof in the headline but they are not waterproof. I will be returning them.
1.0,Chose this because of stated head circumference sizing and it was not correct.
1.0,Not an American size. It is a great material
1.0,The bra ate through my skin right above my boobs. They are super cute but they are flesh eaters.
1.0,"This head warmer is so tiny that it can probably fit a child, but not an adult ( or I just have a gianormous head!)  It looks wide on the photo , but it's very narrow and it covers just my forehead, but nothing above it.  I anticipated more substantial, thicker headband. I will be returning."
1.0,Said it was the right bands for my watch and they were not. They weren't even close to fitting! Very disappointing!
1.0,"This shirt looked so pretty in the picture, but I felt it looks awful in person. I don't like anything about it. The color and material were awful."
1.0,Color does not look like the picture
1.0,these things were poor quality and i got two right foot slippers -.-
1.0,"I am 5'3"", about 100 pounds, and usually wear a US XS or XXS, Asian S. This sweater is very short and wide, with very short sleeves.<br />I gave this sweater 3 tries. First, I ordered a SMALL. It was pretty baggy and loose, but the sleeves barely passed my elbows, and the bottom of the sweater barely reached my waist. I thought it was probably a dud--it happens. I decided to size up to a MEDIUM for the replacement because I wanted length like the picture and figured it couldn't really be too baggy. The sleeves on the medium still fell short of my wrists and the bottom hit above the waistband of my jeans.<br />I LOVE the fabric and the colors, so I decided to give it one more shot--I ordered an XL/EXTRA LARGE in a different color as I wanted baggy anyway, and the bigger size would get me the length I wanted. NOPE.<br />The sleeves in the XL barely touch my wrists with my arms at my side, but if I raise my arms, the sleeves are short. The bottom is still far shy of my hips--again, I'm only 5ft 3in--most everything is too long for me. The body fit the same as the small and medium, but the sleeves were ridiculously big, like lantern sleeves, which are nice, but not for this sweater.<br /><br />So overall, a star because the knitting and colors are beautiful, but the fit is too weird to make it a wearable piece."
1.0,I bought a 3xl because it says they run small and it fits like a medium very unhappy with this vest
1.0,Seemed to be of poor quality material and poorly made.  The waist was &#34;puckered&#34; where it was attached to the waistband.
1.0,"I have been through 2 of these and both are cheap and come apart every time, not durable at all and will never repurchase this particular one."
1.0,The front cut or stitch is so odd. Do not recommend.
1.0,Purchased this bag thinking it would be bigger didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the measurements just assumed it would be bigger because it‚Äôs a tote bag. I paid $34 for the bigger size but it‚Äôs tiny ! Now it‚Äôs going for $19 . Definitely returning this bag immediately. Worth $19 but not $34 .
1.0,"The fit is as described,  the color is not. This is their ""grey"" ....it is blue definitely, not grey. Extremely bummed."
1.0,"I wish I could give it a better review because the earrings were just beautiful but mine broke less than a week of having them , they were glued to the stem and the steam can't take very much wear"
1.0,Very flimsy didn't stay on well
1.0,"I just received my set of 3 tank shirts  , and come to open them and the black tank had white deodorant marks all over it , how disgusting !!! Will be sending back ASAP"
1.0,"Completely disappointed, one earring doesn‚Äôt even open."
1.0,This sweater caught my attention right away. I loved the way it looked and the blue is very dark. It is well made but the size is extremely small. I ordered the largest size available but it is so small so I have to return it.
1.0,All three pair broke within a few days of use.  I will buy from another source.
1.0,I just received my package and th shoes has mold on them
1.0,It broke into pieces and I didn't even wear it.  It looked exciting but was just terrible.  I sent it back.
1.0,Arms don't move. Seller won't reply
1.0,The pants were not even close to the correct size. I ordered 32 x 32. I could not even pull them up. I had to give them away.
1.0,This product is of such poor quality  cheap material not what I expected at all. It looks like I made it!!!!
1.0,this is a beautiful lap top bag or briefcase not a shoulder bag. It has two compartments is as big as a laptop and has the beautiful picture on the front. It's way too big for me. I went back to see if dimensions were given and couldn't find them. If I missed them then 5 stars for a really beautiful picture.
1.0,Item came a month after i ordered. Days after Christmas. Then the material was bad and it was tooooo big.
1.0,"Very thing and cheaply made, seam ripped the day I wore it."
1.0,I ordered an xl for my 12 yr old. She usually wears a L.  The sizing is extra small!! No way this would fit any teen or adult unless they are tiny !<br />It delivered really slow so I will gift this to a child.
1.0,"Beautiful watch at a great price which is why it shouldn't surprise me that it didn't last long.  Less than two months and a piece on the inside came off and just moves around, it can still tell time but can't change any of the other things."
1.0,Horrible quality. Spent $38 for these and in less than 2 months (with light wear and proper care) this happened.
1.0,Cheap plastic crap - I threw them away!
1.0,The bag looks great but the inside and outside zipper are very poor quality. Both broke after about once a week for a month. I took this bag on a 3 week trip and broke after the first week. Had to travel the rest of the time with a bag that wouldn't close. Wouldn't recommend
1.0,"Do not like material,  do not like style.<br />I sent this blouse back to you on 10.30.2018"
1.0,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Doesn‚Äôt even seem like I‚Äôm wearing anything. This won‚Äôt stop anything from coming through. Doesn‚Äôt stop the cold,wind, and not comfortable at all."
1.0,The elastic didn't work and even though I had the right size it was way to tight and my phone didn't fit.
1.0,A ver para el objetivo por el cual compre no me funciono tal ves a otros si gracias
1.0,did not come close to fitting on a well endowed woman
1.0,"My 3.5 year old wears a size 9 shoe. Bought these in a 9 for him. But when we received them, they were way too small. They fit my 2.5 year old so I figured I‚Äôd keep them for him and reorder for my 3.5 in a size up which would be size 10. Received the 10 and it‚Äôs huge! At least 2-3 sizes bigger than the 9! Now what?! Either this was just a fluke or there is something very wrong with the sizing of these shoes. You can see in the pictures that there is no way these two pairs of shoes are just one size difference. I was really excited about these, but now I‚Äôm just super disappointed."
1.0,Too small as I got
1.0,Pass on by this hat! It came smashed in a tiny bag. Way to small!! I am extremely disappointed with this hat. Color was a lot more faded then the picture it looks like it was worn for several years definitely not new! No response from seller either.
1.0,not size and fit accurate<br />not well made<br />poor quality control
1.0,I returned this asap. It projected nothing. There was no definition in the objects...just a glow in the room. Very disappointed
1.0,First-the product comes from China directly and the directions are impossible to decipher and follow. Nobody--and I mean NOBODY- could get this to set to anything but military time---when you buy it for an older person --that doesn't work at all!! A complete waste
1.0,The dress sent to me doesn‚Äôt look anything like picture.  Buyer beware!
1.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and size 4/6, and this thing was made way too short. The width between the neck and breasts is atleast 3‚Äù-4‚Äù too short. And I have a short torso, from my neck to the bottom of my chest. The chest strap came to the top of my breasts, so I could tie it. Shaggs are also too far apart and some were falling off. I‚Äôm very disappointed of how my $18 was wasted on this piece of lingerie. Please make shaggs between neck and breasts longer. üôèüèºUntil then listen to me and Anastasiya, save your money."
1.0,"I should have listen to the reviews, the battery dead fast"
1.0,Came with diet marks on the bottom like they were already had been worn before being shipped to me. Will definitely be returning them
1.0,Can see through material beyond cheap product. Looks like child constructed..
1.0,Why did I order a green and black coat & receive a green and black coat with colorful pockets with flags and stuff in it as if they ran out of material! Unacceptable!
1.0,"It's okay... until the chintzy retractable handle breaks. Then, you're on your own because the manufacturer absolutely does not stand behind their product. You're pretty much on your own."
1.0,Worst thing I've ever purchased. Threw out immediately. Looks great but is so stiff and pluks out all your arm hair. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
1.0,"Order only if you are sure you will not need to return.  Seller makes returning item a hassle.  Shirt is thin, looks and feels cheap.  Fit is true to size."
1.0,Needing to return . Not flared at the bottom as shown
1.0,This is huge there is no way humanly possible this fits all as it says in the description!
1.0,The product description and the images lead me to believe this was both a top and bottom set of which I only recieved the top.
1.0,"The material‚Äôs quality is very uncomfortable, and unpleasant...and does not fit well on the body!"
1.0,Zero protection. Poor visibility through the plastic ‚Äúglass‚Äù.
1.0,"Awful quality.. the brim is completely off center. I'm not even sure what kind of material it actually is.. the pull string to make it tighter was a weird surprise. Threw it in the trash , not even worth a return process.. $8 hat for the trash ... yup they got me..."
1.0,"Product was different than expected. Color and style were similar but not exact. Material was very thin. Ordered XS and it was too large, not long or tailored like the picture. Took out of package and immediately put back in and sent it back. Picture is flattering, item received was not."
1.0,"This seemed great at first. I loved the color and it was easy to install but less than a month later and the little center bracket that keeps the band from popped out of the watch broke and the band wouldn't stay in. Worse yet, it was while I was on vacation and I had to spend part of an afternoon of my vacation trying to find a new watch band so my watch wouldn't fall off. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"This skirt is very cute. However, that's about all it has going for it. It fits EXTREMELY small. Despite using the company's size chart and ordering the appropriate size, the skirt wouldn't even button. Not only that but the material was very cheap and flimsy."
1.0,"This necklace looks like rose gold rather than yellow gold, is not very long, and is plastic. I will never wear it because it looks incredibly cheap!"
1.0,What a waste of money. These are so small they should be advertised for kids. You suck for falsely advertising a product when clearly it is not as described.
1.0,Runs very small. I ordered extra large and it fits like a medium. The material probably will shrink when it is washed. Very disappointed with this purchase.
1.0,"It is too small, the sizing is way off and the button holes were to small to button the bottom closure."
1.0,"Awful quality, non allergic, looks poorly worked..."
1.0,They showed up in a million pieces. They were in a big box with other things so not sure how they broke like that. Nothing was heavy in the box.
1.0,The words are already coming off and it's a bit small
1.0,"Did not have this very long and has fallen apart already, junk! Don't waste your time!"
1.0,If the socks were about 4in longer they would be great. Because they are so short and extremely difficult to try and stretch high enough they will never be worn until finally I throw them up or find someone's very short to give them to. Disappointing
1.0,"Inside jacket pocket ripped IMMEDIATELY:(<br />I‚Äôve had the same winter jacket for 15 years, then splurge on a new expensive north face jacket and the most important pocket rips the first day!"
1.0,Cheap! Ripped on the first day it was used not worth what was paid.
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy. It‚Äôs not worth to wear even
1.0,I loved them online and on other people but when I tried them on they looked comically large.
1.0,These came with the seam on the inside of the leg ripped open. Not very high quality.
1.0,Fabric is very scratchy. I have large calves and wear a size 8 women‚Äôs shoe and the sock was not compressing
1.0,Love the shirt  but runs  really  small
1.0,No me gusto porque lo enviaron usado sin etiqurta y sucio que terrible son wao
1.0,Pretty bracelets but they're not lava stone.  Wanted to use them with essential oils but had to return them instead.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"Not worth one red cent. Don't bother, only made jewelry WORSE! Wish I could get my money back for this. Now I'm stuck with a smelly blue rag that does nothing!"
1.0,Bought a size bigger because reviews said ran small. They didn't say these run almost 2 sizes smaller.
1.0,Feathers all separated and sections not blending together when you bend the fabric. Not as pictured.
1.0,"Very very disappointed. Not at all the wings that are pictured. The wings are cheap, bright pink, and don't even stand up. If you are interested in this costume because of the pretty wings they are advertising , prepare to be severely disappointed. Will be returning."
1.0,Meant for a granny
1.0,This item is exactly as described but is extremely uncomfortable. The shoulder straps and lace along the bottom roll and the cups flatten and do not accentuate.
1.0,"The holographic film, or whatever makes the rainbow effect, makes you see a blur on everything and double of most. Bought for my 6th grader for school.. Can't use it with the computer screen. Trash."
1.0,"Giving 5 for sturdiness despite 1 overall review since it took the full force of being chucked at the mirror, wall AND trash can without breaking due to its innately impact resistant silicone construction‚Ä¶ however it doesn‚Äôt stick to anything, mirror, tile, glass, sheet metal, or my hopes and dreams. Would steer clear of this rip off of a product. My biggest regret beyond buying it in the first place thinking it was going to be fantastic for my bad habit of wearing glasses into the shower is not testing it soon enough to return this absolute garbage."
1.0,Received today and one of the masks arrived torn in the seam. The material is hard and not a comfortable feel in the face.
1.0,Can‚Äôt return. I missed the return window. On the first day of use it broke! I was t doing heavy walking. Just to and from the car. Worst show ever. Do not buy.
1.0,Wouldnt stay shut. I lost a charm my son gave me for mothers day
1.0,"Sent back ,Lost  30 dollars on this one, third party freight! nice vest , but runs small and was itchy, like it had been sitting in the closet for 10 years!"
1.0,Tarnished after two weeks
1.0,JUST NOT WORTH THE COST
1.0,I have numerous Coolibar gaitors and this one is unwearable as to size.  Maybe for a small child.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt fit my keys
1.0,I ordered this for my mother in law.  She is an x-large. By other reviews I knew it would run small so I got her the largest size of a 2 x. It came in and looks like it would fit an xsmall.
1.0,Fell apart after one week.
1.0,I wore this for less than 4 hours and the stone came out. I was picking up dog toys when it fell out!
1.0,"This dress didn't fit like I hoped it would. The top was wierd, the sides are cut differently and don't exactly match, so I paired it with a denim jacket. It is very long, so I gathered the bottom and tied it in a knot. The material is not of great quality, it's very thin, so I have to wear a camisole underneath as well as a slip. Overall, I wanted to return this dress but time got away from me and I missed the deadline."
1.0,"These earrings were such a disappointment. The bow and jingle bell earrings were very cute and lightweight, however, mine arrived broken. The Christmas bows are heavy and hung poorly from my ears. As you can see, the silver bow is tarnished. I think I can fix the bow and jingle bell earrings but the Christmas bows I will not wear as they are. Completely disappointed and do not recommend the Christmas bows."
1.0,it runs small in the bust
1.0,"It was just delivered to my door and it looks like they were used before.<br />The material feels very weak, it doesn‚Äôt look/feel like the other Melissa sandals we have. It feels like it will break at any moment.<br />It runs very small, I ordered 1 size up after reading the reviews and it‚Äôs still small."
1.0,"I can get them on, but they are too tight/narrow - and my feet are on the smaller side!"
1.0,I ordered  an adult size large and the fit like child size and the stitching was terrible.<br />I  will never buy form this vender again.
1.0,i love the necklace but the clasp was broken when i got it so i had to take it to be fixed already.
1.0,"Bought both this striped one and a printed sweater. The printed one came in perfectly in a L. Fit TTS. The pink/purple striped one, however, fit like a 2x. I get its supposed to be flowy, but this was outright baggie and was just so wide it looked awful on."
1.0,The band looks cheap and generic.
1.0,"Previous reviews were correct. Item is browned. It also caused brown smudges all over the onesie. The item is defective, I'm returning it."
1.0,It‚Äôs cute but smaller then the normal kids backpack. That didn‚Äôt matter much but the pencil pouch already ripped & the Pom Pom broke 2 days after school started.
1.0,Smells very dusty... like it‚Äôs been in the garage for so long
1.0,Returned . Cheaply made & material
1.0,Ordered a 5xl for a family member. When product came in measured waist and was a 1xl size with a tag that says 5xl.  Caution on larger sizes may not fit as expected.  Had to return.
1.0,I super hate these.  Feels and looks like swimsuit material.  The waistband doesn't lay flat at the pleats.
1.0,There‚Äôs no back<br />To this and the strings are extra confusing. But other than that.. okay product
1.0,"The quality of this sweater is so poor. The material looks like cheap terry cloth and feels rough and itchy. From the photos I though the fabric was going to be like a tick flannel or like a sweatshirt. While the material was rough and stiff, it was thin and caused the sweater to not sit well. Additionally, there were a lot of loose threads and damaged edges of fabric. There are no buttons or closures on the front of the sweater."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS BAG!! That's the bottom line, it looks cute in the photo but its a very cheap looking bag in reality. The material is cheap, the zipper is cheap, the straps feel like paper... Save your money, please... My brother laughed and asked how much i paid for it... lol"
1.0,Did not know how to get it to fit.  Took too long to figure out and I wanted to get to the beach.  So this was a waste of money as there were no directions.
1.0,No padding what so ever. Skip this product.
1.0,Did  look right on me but sizing was right just didn't like how it looked on me
1.0,"I am a very handy person.  Read all the reviews.  Got the nose pads.  Taking the old pads off the frame was a chore and a half !  Next, per some of the reviews, sent for the appropriate super glue.  Tried everything but to no avail.  First, the residue left on the frame is virtually impossible to get entirely off.  After a considerable amount of time and being careful not to cut off the three tiny nubs.  The glue, as recommended was entirely inappropriate and useless.  Fitting the replacement nose pads onto the three nubs on the frame is HIGHLY problematic.  After 2 hours of fiddling around I chucked nose pads and frame out.  NOW, I read that the outsourcing by Bolle' to China raises quality control issues with the lenses popping out of the frame.  Very disheartening for a once high quality brand, who has now sold out it's customers to poorly made Chinese copies."
1.0,The socks are very small I wear a size 81/2 and they barely fit my foot
1.0,Alot Smaller Than Expected! Not Recommended As A Gift For A Man! Shipping Was Fast Though.
1.0,Bad looking and quality pants
1.0,Poorly made. Used for in home use and completely came apart in 2days. Revealed clear glue throughout seams.
1.0,"The tote bag I received doesn't resemble the one pictured on the Amazon listing beyond being a similar color and size. The advertised bag features a front pocket with a flap; one side of my bag has a zipper pocket and two slip pockets, and the other has one zip pocket, with nary a flap in sight.The crossbody strap of the bag advertised clips on and is removable; the crowsbody strap on the bag I received is sewn on.  The slip pockets on the ends have black snaps (not present in the advertised bag) that are an eyesore and don't match the rest of the hardware of the bag, which is silver. The straps are more of a bubblegum pink while the exterior of the bag is a softer, more beige-y pink, a disappointingly poor color match. Overall, this bag seems sturdy and has good organization but looks very unappealing, and it is most definitely not what was advertised."
1.0,I bought these for my 4 year old twin girls to wear with their boots and they will not stay up on either of my girls.
1.0,"Mine aren't even close to the photo. They don't have the tie at the bottom of the legs, and they have a &#34;paperbag&#34; style waist. Not at all what I ordered. Very disappointed"
1.0,"Had to give a star, Horrible they sent me to left shoes. Went to use them and obviously couldn‚Äôt, big waste of money!!!"
1.0,I ordered this and another Set I got the black one but not the green one they said they was together but it just was one in there and they don‚Äôt want to give my money back
1.0,"These gloves are so hard and stiff, I can't even get my hands into them.  It's like they were melted and then frozen.  I tried running them under hot water but that was no help.  Since I got these for a discount, I just threw them away."
1.0,"I had ordered this for my wife as a mother's day gift from my son. The pajama set we received was visibly used. It was reeking of perfume, the shirt was inside out in the package, there were no tags to indicate that the set was new/unused and the pajamas were ripped along the seams at several locations. Imagine my wife's surprise when she received a gift in such a horrible condition. We have since then returned the pajamas and asked for a refund."
1.0,"Beautiful color that promises a lot. Unfortunately, it was too flimsy. Tight at the top and loose at the waist."
1.0,It sucks nothing like what it supposed to be
1.0,I bought 3 chocolate bunnies 2 were melted and 1 was missing. Very unsatisfied.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt fit and looked cheap. Poorly made
1.0,It was ok to look at but broke the second time I wore it. I know it was very inexpensive but I wish it would've lasted longer.
1.0,Zipper broke 1st day I received it. Returned for a refund.
1.0,Top fit the pants were a size too small. Had to buy another pair of 3T pants for my grand baby to wear the top!!!
1.0,They looked like they were rusted/used
1.0,Robo
1.0,These should be +1 diopter that focuses at 1 meter.  They are 0.  No power.  They are also not returnable.  DO NOT BUY
1.0,"Me llegaron defectuosos, ped√≠ un reembolso y nunca me reembolsaron."
1.0,"The watches are unsuitable, straps too long, snaps don't stay together, absolutely useless"
1.0,"The battery compartment is easily opened by little fingers. Button batteries can be hazardous when swallowed. Wish the battery compartment had been securely closed with a screw, etc. I had to return these due to safety concerns."
1.0,"if you look at the image you think you are getting three items...fairly reasonable sized right?<br />NO, only one bag showed up.  DONT BUY IT"
1.0,"The orange is not orange, its red. Also the design reveals your underwear."
1.0,A very cute outfit but had to give it to my six-year-old bought a size 14/16 and fits like a size 8
1.0,They came apart within a few days of wearing them.
1.0,Both used and torn pieces came from the product. I bought a new product but it was used.
1.0,had to send it back.sent me a size too big.
1.0,The product has very thin material and the fit was smaller than expected.  ok product just not a good fit for me
1.0,The quality is very nice but the fit is way off.  I ordered according to the measurements on the size chart and it is very small.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt help with the sneaker odor. I stuck 2 in each shoe and it still didn‚Äôt work. Waste of money. I cannot recommend them.
1.0,Too small. Material is good but shoulders are big tight and seems to be small. I didnt like it
1.0,"This was not sturdy, very flimsy. It open one time but would not EVER stay open. My daughter was so disappointed."
1.0,This is so ugly in person. the colors are not pretty and vibrant like the picture. the one I received looks very cheap and the colors are faded. It is not worth they buy because you can't return it to the company. Wasted money and I won't buy clothes again unless they are on prime shipping so I can return without the hassle.
1.0,I wanted to like these but they kept riding up the leg and not staying where they should. Disappointed
1.0,Not used everyday and already faded. Looks like crap.
1.0,Very poor quallity and seeing through
1.0,"I've ordered a new one, but I've received used one."
1.0,This is a piece of junk. It does not stand up to the lightest bit of wind. It is constantly flipping in reverse and the ribs keep breaking one by one. It is a horrible umbrella that is very heavy. It didn't even provide the least bit of sun protection as the umbrella information claimed. It's hotter under the umbrella than not using it at all.  Its flimsy and horrible made. Other cheaper brands are better than this.
1.0,Very tight in the sleeve.
1.0,"While these are not expensive readers, they should at least work for more than 24 hours.  Literally snapped, cracked and the lens popped out while wearing them for the first time.<br /><br />Cheap product - avoid purchase."
1.0,The neck is way too large and shows the undershirt. The bow is too large in an ugly way. Also the bow was not sown in the back but came separate to be attached with pin which does not work or safe for a toddler. It destroyed my kids pictures for the occasion
1.0,"The quality is horrible. Within a month of usage, the fabric started tearing off on each of the shoe. My son has been wearing other shoes of same and different brands which generally last for 5-6 months easily but these are way too low quality. Avoid these."
1.0,Received for Christmas and have only worn one week. Sticking already coming apart. Can‚Äôt wear slipper anymore.
1.0,Arrived broken. I sent it back
1.0,"The bag is not big enough for my needs as i wanted to put notebooks for folders inside which will not fit. It is also NOT structured ie. will not stand up alone as shown. The straps and chains are wider then expected although the length is good. Quality was not good but as expected for the price. Overall, disappointed with the product and will have to be returned."
1.0,Packaging says they are 22mm. They are not. They are more like 18mm.
1.0,Absolutely not. Firstly the top is wayyy to small like they won‚Äôt even cover what they need to cover. Also the bottom in the picture looks like it‚Äôs seamless but it is most definitely NOT. Returning
1.0,"This was a repeat order.  The first pair were great, the second pair looked nothing like the first!  They were the ugliest ballet slippers I have seen.  My daughter would not even try them on.  Color, cloth, soles, and that front leathery thing were completely different."
1.0,"The band fell a part, the first week I wore it... super cute but cheaply made.."
1.0,Only.one item got sent!
1.0,Very cheap looking. Vest felt like it was almost paper
1.0,"These are thin cheaply made gloves, the took about a month to arrive then were all shoved into a zip lock bag"
1.0,These were NOT as shown in the picture. It does not lock on as shown but actually a thin portion has to fit into a hollowed out area.  Not what I was expecting.
1.0,Poedra falsa
1.0,The earrings still irritated my ear.  I even put antibiotic cream before I put it in.<br />Not happy I cant wear these
1.0,Same as above.
1.0,Shows a draw string but it is not a working draw string just for looks.
1.0,"Had to do some serious modifications. It was like it was made for mutants. Long skinny arms, holes on the pockets for tiny hands. Also, this has no lining and is see through. Took forever to be delivered."
1.0,The quality is terrible. It‚Äôs way too thin and the seams are not only uneven but coming apart straight out of the bag. I tried to return it but they said they‚Äôd get me return info and never responded to me again so I‚Äôm stuck with it.
1.0,"Dress is fine and true to size, but color was so off!! I ordered beige expecting cream. It came in almost diluted per yellow. A camel color.  It was not beige and not a pretty color. False advertising"
1.0,"Pin fell out of wristband the first day. Useless now, cannot latch the band."
1.0,Does not look like what is in the picture at all.  The color is bright purple and not burgundy.  I‚Äôm returning this.
1.0,They were cheaply made. Broke to easily. I‚Äôve thrown them out and replaced with stronger gloves.
1.0,Lights stopped working a couple weeks into son wearing the shoes. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
1.0,Because they don‚Äôt fit well they really don‚Äôt line up with the edge of the glasses and offer little protection against anything. Waste of money.
1.0,Very pretty  but it will turn your skin green
1.0,"shrunk after first wash, so maybe too short now and was comfy but pocket already has a hole in it."
1.0,Overall poor quality; waste of money.  Next time I will buy name brand underwear.
1.0,It looked nice but the fabric has faded a lot  after 1 season. The mechanics still work ok
1.0,The posts were way to thick. They hurt to put in.
1.0,"They are fricking see through. Sold as leggings. But in reality they are tights, which are thick pantyhose. Not happy. At all."
1.0,"These are not medical masks. Do not believe they are in any way, although they can help. I can't get medical disposable masks, and other cotton ones (also not medical) make my glasses fog easily. I knew this when making the purchase. Although it took nearly 2 months to arrive, everything I ordered seems to be complete. However, the pocket is too small for the filter. Update, seller sent out a replacement. Should have been 4 masks. Only got 3. 1 of those 3 the filter fits into. Waste of money and time."
1.0,Broke the 1st use
1.0,"Arrived with scratches, very flimsy, the lightest wind blows it clear off your face or shirt.<br />not as polarized as I wanted, you can see my eyes, and they dont block any sunlight. defeats the whole purpose of a sunglasses."
1.0,Ears were lopsided. The horn was off center and barely attached. I was extremely disappointed.
1.0,"They are definitely NOT optically correct, and I had to take these off while driving because they distorted my vision so much.  Spend the extra money and get optically correct sunglasses."
1.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap! I knew there was something wrong the moment I took it out of the plastic. Another reviewer said Hera was rent-like material, I will agree with that. It‚Äôs terrible. I will definitely be returning and accepting nothing less than a full refund."
1.0,These are so cheap in quality and appearance. I don't know why I bought these. An acorn already broke off from the squirrel and I found it as my toddler almost put it in her mouth (it was the size of the tip of my finger so she definitely could have choked on it). One of the scarecrows posts broke off sometime when I was wearing them. Complete junk. To much of a hassle to return so I will probably just throw away. I'm seriously so frustrated I wasted my money.
1.0,Size is way off by chart and poor quality.
1.0,Please see other reviews about the seam across the front. It really is unflattering and does not look good!
1.0,Too cheap looking and feeling
1.0,backs dont fit on earrings  they were bent
1.0,"I usually wear an XL but I ordered a 3x in this to make sure it was really big and baggy to wear with leggings, but it‚Äôs me perfectly like a normal xl sweatshirt would. Not nearly as big as I assumed a 3x would be."
1.0,"I am a small-busted BBW and the &#34;shelf bra&#34; in this was too small even for my modest bosom and didn't fit. Also, the bottom edge of the tank was not even hemmed, and the suit, overall, fit quite poorly. Do a little more research and find a BETTER suit, this is so not it. I got rid of mine after wearing it a few times, a sad waste of money."
1.0,The romper didn‚Äôt fit and was cheaply made.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:6d6def1584bad10374284356f8452105]] I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it, you have to destroy your OEM key fob in order to get it swapped. The new one does not have metal inserts so if you slightly over tighten it, it will never tighten again. The button press feels pretty solid. The key feels very sturdy, but you must very gingerly tighten the screws, the moment you realize you‚Äôve overtightened it, it will never tighten again. $18.99 down the drain. And your OEM key fob is destroyed, so no going back."
1.0,"Seller says it‚Äôs a mothball smell and I shouldn‚Äôt have washed the dress. Does not smell like mothballs to me and washing had no effect on the smell. Now trying my usual last resort, hang it in the sun for several days hoping that will do it."
1.0,Very thin cheap
1.0,The dress went way below my knees and was way too big
1.0,These are very pretty but they can‚Äôt be worn around the neck without getting caught in the hair on the back of your neck‚Ä¶painful!
1.0,Not the same as the photo. I'm so disappointed
1.0,Cheap scratchy material and nothing like the photos. Do not buy this!
1.0,"These leggings pill very badly with the first wash and impossible to remove the pilling.  Too bad because they are warm and cozy, but after the first wash are too unsightly to wear."
1.0,The earrings are not made well !!!! The London blue topaz stone had falling out of box on to floor when I opened it up Xmas morning!! Very disappointed in quality you get what you pay for!! I guess !!
1.0,these change color and look cheap
1.0,Skirt is extremely small!  I ordered a xxl but the skirt fits my daughter who wears a L.  Unfortunately I'm stuck with the skirt.
1.0,"Material is not my favorite, it looks cheaply made and not my favorite"
1.0,Worse material ever. Super see through. Does not look like picture at all.
1.0,"This stocking is well made, but does not fit like the size it is advertised as.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"I'm not sure what happened but we got this for my husband's dad for Christmas and it was about the size for a little child. Of course we had to buy something else. Not sure what they did with the sweater....maybe gave to a kid that it would fit. I'm  pretty sure we ordered it right, but won't do it again."
1.0,"Returned with a following comment: &#34;If this is XXL product, I must be 5XL and I am only XL&#34;..."
1.0,I wasn't impressed with these at all. The sew line is right on your toes which makes it uncomfortable. The feel like a thick pantyhose type material.
1.0,I returned this due to the lining.  If it had had just a plain lining instead of the ‚Äúfaux‚Äù designer lining it would have been great!
1.0,Not for big hipped girls the bottom has a band on it so it doesn‚Äôt fall like the image like a t shirt. And the fabric is very thin for mild weather
1.0,This dress is 100% polyester. The description says 85% cotton 15% linen. I‚Äôm sending it back. I gave it one star. The color is cute
1.0,This short runs very small. Material is also super clingy.  I had to return iui t. Return process was very easy.
1.0,Disappointed in the green stones.  They look yellow.  Not dark emerald green as the picture depicts.
1.0,My son couldn‚Äôt breathe. It was light he was sucking in a plastic bag. Very dangerous!!!
1.0,Very cheap looking couldn't pull it off
1.0,"I wear a size 9 (men's) and the smaller size is way to small.  They are thin, slippery on flat floors, and don't keep my feet warm.  A regular pair of cotton socks are much better.  They're terrible"
1.0,The chain portion broke immediately.  Very low quality.
1.0,"You get what you pay for here. The material is weirdly thick and cheap, and it's not really shaped or sized like it is in the photos. Would not recommend."
1.0,I normally wear a size 10 jacket  but ordered a XXXL to allow room because it indicated the Jacket ran small. This was beyond small.
1.0,Just received it today tried to put the strap on button fell off.
1.0,"The lights did not work. Replaced batteries and the light on the battery pack turns on, just not the leds for the overall costume. Will be returning for a refund."
1.0,I didn't like the product. It looks really cheap.
1.0,"The colors were great. They are light weight. Cooling‚Ä¶NO! My clients complained of sliding down, during work sessions.."
1.0,"Had previously ordered another color and liked it so decided to get it in white. The dress arrived looking like it was a return with a stain on it so ended up returning it. For anyone considering, the color is off white/cream not white as pictured and they run large."
1.0,"Really cute, but got holes in the toes of both shoes after 2 weeks of wear."
1.0,Very hard to shine cell or any other light into lens. Looks and feels cheat. Super cool idea.
1.0,"This was a Christmas gift from Santa for my 6 year-old.  She loves LOL dolls and was absolutely thrilled with the watch.  However, within 2 hours the watch malfunctioned and started making a high-pitch noise that made every member of my family run away, begging me to make it stop.  My husband is now searching through the garbage to find the original package so we can return this watch.  After reading a few other reviews, no one could make the noise stop and a few resorted to smashing the watch to make it stop (it really is that bad).  I however wrapped the speaker portion of the watch in electrical tape, then put aluminum foil around it and then put it in an air tight tupperware.  The noise magically stopped as I was writing the review and the watch appears to be functioning normally again.  However, the noise and a fear of recurrence was enough to change my daughters mind and she now hates the watch, so it will be returned."
1.0,"Fit nothing like the photos, was itchy rough fabric and the edges were sewn poorly. Would not buy again,  this outfit ended up in a free box I put out."
1.0,XXL fits like a small!!
1.0,I received an empty envelope without anything inside. I can‚Äôt even return anything.
1.0,Way too small and was very thin. Didn't look like the picture at all.
1.0,The first time I ordered these I really liked them but the 2nd time I ordered the same ones and they were pink.  Misleading.
1.0,They unraveled a few hours after I put them on. You could just toss your money out the window and not have to worry with the whole process of being ripped off like this - it'd be so much easier.
1.0,"I was so stoked when I got these, they look amazing on! 2 months in and they look like crap! They have weird staining on the lenses that can't be cleaned off. It's like a permanent fog and discoloration and of course the return time is over. I always keep them in the soft case they provided and take great care of them. I am very VERY disappointed in the quality of these sunglasses!"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:a1471755dfcbd637fd2542394a38be3c]] The quality of the band was not worth the purchase‚Ä¶
1.0,Very short. Can't wrap around neck. Color was nice.
1.0,Strings on the hat are fraying after just 1 month of occasional use
1.0,It was very inexpensive and the ‚Äúopal‚Äù fell off within 2 wearings
1.0,"These were just regular tshirts, there was no ""compressing"" at all."
1.0,Bathing suit type material<br />Cheaply made<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and it was to my ankles<br />Returned it because it was so cheap looking
1.0,This dress is nothing as pictured. Terrible quality dollar store fabric. The shape of the dress is not even close to being the same as picture.
1.0,My daughter received this for Easter and it broke today.
1.0,"Update. Second band lasted 1 month before falling apart. Avoid.<br /><br />I really like the color and design, it fits perfectly my retro Pebble watch, but the strap fell apart after a year of abuse (I wear it almost 24 hrs. a day). I just ordered another one - it's inexpensive, and did I mention I really liked it? Comes with extra pins and a tool to install them."
1.0,Ummm junk fabric. Is this what is for human wear or table cloth???
1.0,Very small. Must be made for a toddler's ear. Item returned and reported to Amazon about the advertisement.
1.0,"Just no. The fabric is cheap, scratchy, and not particularly stretchy. The leggings themselves are poorly made - the waist band is a weird width and doesn‚Äôt fit smoothly, and the elastic within the top of the band isn‚Äôt securely in the right place either. The leggings also have a chemical smell out of the bag. If you actually want to do yoga or work out in you leggings, don‚Äôt get these. I‚Äôm sending these straight back."
1.0,These were not mock turtlenecks.  Returned.
1.0,"Was supposed to be for our 60 anniversary party,"
1.0,De dos lavada qued√≥ as√≠ üò≠üò´
1.0,"I tried this twice and it Didn't work either time. It was charged, but nothing."
1.0,Careful - bottom band is really tight. Also does not wash real well- color fades
1.0,"Fell apart first time I wore it, very cheap materials."
1.0,The metal bands are falling apart that hold the sizing portion of the shirt stays. Lasted about 4 weeks.
1.0,"Bought this for my wife and after a couple of months the band broke and all the stones went everywhere and she was totally disappointed. Do not buy this if you expect it to last. This is a cheaply constructed product designed not to last, just to make profit."
1.0,"Couldn't believe that this dress was unfinished!! There was no hem or finishing of the two armholes.  Impossible to wear an unfinished garment, right?  This dress will be returned.  Other than the major workmanship flaw, the dress fit as expected and was cute."
1.0,Sent back immediately !
1.0,The questions answered said the 32$ option was the corset and the skirt. It arrived today with no corset. Extremely disappointed that this was not sent as the set like it was supposed to. Looks like I am not the only one who did not get both pieces when ordering the most expensive option. Buyer beware.
1.0,Poor construction. Pockets positioned too far high and back making the jacket not to fit right. You have to keep adjusting it. Pockets too should be made of lighter material. Cannot return because I washed it. Waste of money!
1.0,fits snug as a glove.. I will have to return this product.
1.0,Phone carrier arrived yesterday and strap connector completely fell apart when I initially tried to connect.  Would probably work okay with another strap. See attached picture of broken clasp.
1.0,Does anyone know if these come in a set?  Amazon seems only to be selling this as a single and that just won't do during the harsh winter months.
1.0,Bad termination
1.0,Beautiful style but very disappointed in the advertised sizing of these garment. Seller has to correct this mistake and STOP FOOLING THE CUSTOMERS! They are too small for the advertised size. Definitely have to return the item.
1.0,"Only used a couple of times for sunscreen, phone, etc. and the straw connecting to the strap breaking and peeling all around the top. :("
1.0,Product was so small even tho it was supposed to be a large! Couldn‚Äôt get both legs in at the same time. Tried one leg and the pant leg was so constricted that I couldn‚Äôt pull up the legging.
1.0,"Fit was as expected, however the quality was very poor. Both front pockets were not completely sewn requiring my wife to sew them.<br />Will never buy Ochenta again, pathetic!"
1.0,Cute sunflower but broke within 10 mins after i put it on.. horrible
1.0,Fit fine just not the correct color I was looking for.
1.0,Post broke first time I tried to put them on.
1.0,Cheap product not worth the price I paid.
1.0,Thin and way way too big to be a SMALL.  It look like a size US12.
1.0,"I threw it away as photo looks great, what you get is awful"
1.0,Broke within the 1st week.  Chain fell off.
1.0,The shirt fits way too small Bad idea buying clothes through Amazon. First and last time I will ever do that!
1.0,"Not worth it, Its cool for the first few days, but it gets boring, I do regret buying it now."
1.0,"This Isn't what it appears to be, this is actually a tshirt"
1.0,Material is stiff and scratchy.
1.0,"the pink came off, item is a little small"
1.0,Broke after wearing two days
1.0,Nose piece comes off too easy. Cheap quality.
1.0,"Dress arrived dirty, with bad smell and shriveled, it looks used. Very unhappy!! Customer Services want helpful at all"
1.0,"Looks nothing like picture. All beads are same color, a very unattractive orange. Will never wear but not worth sending back."
1.0,"These pants are comfortable enough and I like the pockets, but...<br />The seam below the zipper came apart almost immediately- it may have arrived that way and I noticed it when I wore them about the second time. Recently I wore these &#34;waterproof&#34; pants in some light rain on the beach. It wasn't raining when I left home and started raining while I was walking. My waterproof rain jacket kept my shirt dry but by the time I arrived back home the pants I had underneath these pants were soaked.  So much for keeping dry legs on raining hikes. The quality is questionable due to the unfinished seam and the inconvenience of having to sew them myself now. I do not recommend them."
1.0,Poorly made. Look nothing like the pic
1.0,They had to be returned they came with several scratches on them and I was unable to see through the scratches.
1.0,Horrible!!!  A loop broke in two weeks!!  Then it split right up the back!!!  Save your money!  Unusable in (3) weeks!  thrown out!
1.0,"The material is more like plastic, uncomfortable and cheap looking. Very unhappy"
1.0,Bracelet .. popped within one day if wearing it.
1.0,"Was able to get some lift, but after about 60 seconds the tabs became unstuck. Definitely couldn‚Äôt have lasted a whole night. I was planning to wear under a dress for a wedding and there‚Äôs no way I would have felt confident in this product to stay on. At least the return process is simple. Sending back for a refund."
1.0,Shoes arrived dirty and worn.
1.0,"Absolutely no stretch to these and when you attempt to stretch them, they instantly snap. Waste of money."
1.0,The edges catch on everything & pulls my clothes. Would not recommend
1.0,I'm 18 weeks pregnant and I ordered a size 10 for a wedding that I have coming this Saturday. I received the item yesterday (tuesday) and it was damaged!! There was a hole in the dress and the stitching was awful! It had strings hanging off everywhere on the dress!! I'm so upset and so disappointed! I only have a couple of days left till the wedding on Saturday and now I have nothing  to wear! i definitely won't be able to get a dress by Saturday because the return process takes a couple of days! I will never order from this vendor ever again! The material was definitely cheap and definitely not worth the money!!
1.0,This dress took a month to arrive and it‚Äôs paper thin. I and so disappointed. I was really looking forward to receiving this dress and when it arrived I was like a kid in a candy store until I put it on. It made me look way bigger than I am and it is very thin. I would have to wear a full body suit underneath just to hide my goodies. I returned it.
1.0,Awful turned green in 2 days don‚Äôt do it
1.0,"Bought for my daughter, Does not fit how it should at all"
1.0,"I was really hoping that these worked, but sadly they didn't.  The stick on them didn't last more than 20 minutes before they started slipping down. I tried washing like that instructions said hoping it would help the sticky part, but it was a not go. The flap part that holds you are are not clear like the picture shows. Mine came tan that was the same color as the round part."
1.0,"I really wanted to like these.  I had them on my list for months.  The earring colors don‚Äôt match, one has a third of the stone green and the other had almost no green I returned them."
1.0,Very frustrating. Couldn't even get it to turn on.  I have tried to email the company per instructions with no response.  This was suppose to be my daughters Christmas gift...what a disappointment!  If I get a response from them I will write a better review but for now I am so upset.
1.0,"In 15 years as a barber I've never been more disappointed in a product. Loud, leaky and unreliable in every way. Do not purchase under any circumstances. Mine went into the garbage after a few weeks of frustration trying to get it to perform at all."
1.0,Much smaller than the size advertised. At least they offer free returns.
1.0,The dress and sleeves are way typo small
1.0,Horrible broke apart and warp within days.. Waste of money...
1.0,Too small in the small size and fabric is not the same as described. I returned this. It is much darker than the light purple pictured.
1.0,The stitching at waist was messed up & crooked.
1.0,"This sweater is the perfect color. It is the perfect style.  It fits perfect in the shoulders and just the right length. The fabric is not too hot.  So what is the problem? The buttons are placed in the wrong spots and it causes what my mother used to call, ""The Dolly Parton's"".  In other words, there is a gap in between my breasts and it is very unattractive. I am going to have to get some gray embroidery thread and sew it up and make it a pullover."
1.0,"The waist on these is very high, nothing like the picture."
1.0,Save your money! The gold piece that goes in your completely broke off all 4  before putting it in my ear.
1.0,Transpiraci√≥n buena pero la punta es muy inc√≥moda deber√≠an de ser con la punta m√°s amplia
1.0,"This jacket was advertised as Aeropostle, but it wasn't. The label was different, the fabric was not like other identical jackets I have purchased. I returned it and didn't get a full refund...they subtracted $9.00. Will never order from them again."
1.0,Dropped it and it stopped working
1.0,Item is broken despite barely being used
1.0,Shredded within a few hours of first wearing.  Very poor quality
1.0,"I don't know if I got a bad pin or not, but my mom just called and said the amber just fell off."
1.0,"Broke as soon as i took it out of the wrapping, didnt even open the glasses and the right handle was detached"
1.0,Wore these once and the seams started getting holes in them
1.0,"If you're looking for polarized glasses, these are not. as you can see, i tested them with a pair of polarized glasses on a polarize card test. and you can clearly see how with these, there's no change in the card.<br /><br />also it came in a plastic bag with a generic case that says "" glasses"" it almost feels like these are the Dollger glasses but with less care and false information.<br /><br />I recommend those instead. they are advertised honest, and as stated and come with far more thought out packaging.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/Dollger-Steampunk-Vintage-Sunglasses-Protection/dp/B06XBKKLH5/ref=sr_1_30?crid=1P3784QCZ1M0&keywords=round%2Bsteampunk%2Bglasses&qid=1662676036&sprefix=round%2Bsteampunk%2Bglass%2Caps%2C733&sr=8-30&th=1"
1.0,I was very disappointed when I received this fake leather wristband. Its nothing like the picture and I am convinced those positive reviews are from the seller...won't recommend. You get what u pay for pleather for the price of pleather...
1.0,"It was too big,needed to send it back"
1.0,"Unfortunately this top runs very small. I even sized up one size, and it is still tight. This has no stretch to it at all. Too bad.."
1.0,The shorts didn't last one wash.
1.0,Very cheap shoe. The sole cracked after wearing the shoe the 4th time. To late to get a refund
1.0,Faded after one wash.
1.0,"The fabric was not fleece, and the rainbow effect was poor."
1.0,"Super uncomfortable and way too bulky. Disappointing, I waited too long to return so I am stuck with them."
1.0,These are so small that I cannot hold onto them to get them in my ears.
1.0,Not like the picture UGLY like a sack. Very disappointed
1.0,You get what you pay for. Set does not fit together.
1.0,"Im very disappointed!<br /><br />After one wash this happened.  I had them in a garment bag too and did not put them in the dryer. It became unraveled from the toe!<br /><br />I don‚Äôt see an option for a refund or exchange, can anyone assist?"
1.0,"Not a good product!! It wouldn‚Äôt have fit a ten-year-old!! Cheap fabric, too!"
1.0,"As other reviews have said they can be difficult to take in and out, the black one no longer clasps after removing it once, the silver one doesn't align properly so if it rotates in your nose you can see/feel the seem, and the gold one's hinge was broken upon delivery, never even got to try it"
1.0,Returned cheap material.
1.0,"Ill fitting in all regards. Waist sits lower than expected, resulting in a very unflattering muffin top of a profile. Paired with the skirt which is incredibly long. If you wanna feel like a mermaid while you swim, this is your jam. I was disappointed to say the least"
1.0,"Update: sent the shirt back because the print started peeling/melting. Ordered a replacement and it arrived damage. See photo!<br /><br />Love, love, love!  So soft I could sleep in it and great fit. I need more colors now!"
1.0,"Defective product - The lens optics were wrong. They were returned for refund. Context: I'm nearsighted with presbyopia (varying focal point for close-in vision). The only times that I wear reading glasses are with single-vision contact lenses for computer or reading. Otherwise, I use corrective lenses with a progressive adjustment, in which case reading glasses are not necessary. Product detail: Ordered these reading glasses at the +2.50 correction, matching my progressive adjustment. I knew it was possible that these might correct for closest-in work (reading) and may not work well for computer distance. However, the lenses in the glasses that were delivered were something else all together. With contact lenses in, these glasses simply made everything blurry at every distance. They did not sharpen or magnify anything to any level. If they were actually able to correct any retinal focusing issue, it appeared that they might be useful for farsightedness. But they certainly were not reading glasses. Solution: After returning this product, I went to Walgreens and purchased a +1.75 pair of reading glasses for computer and a +2.50 pair for reading (with contacts). They work well and cost $10 with a buy one, get one free deal. (The Gr8Sight-US product provided 5 pair for $15, including a pair with tinted lenses, but that is not a good deal if they don't correct reading-distance vision.)"
1.0,"The strap broke in less than a week, spend the extra $10 and get real crocs‚Ä¶ they are worth the money."
1.0,"Much dismayed to find this jacket has no pockets of any kind. This day and age a pocket for iPhone is a must on an outermost outfit like jacket or coat. Something is wrong with the designer for this item. Also cuffs are unpractical with loose-fit bands, no buttons or elastic. Again, a design flaw."
1.0,This dress is cheaply made.  Look is not as it appears. I do not recommend this dress
1.0,"If you have any type of cleavage this top will not fit right. At a 32 C cup, this top pools between my breasts. It is to tight around the neck. It is also made of a cheap synthetic fabric."
1.0,They are flimsy and half of them lit up. Not worth buying.
1.0,You get what you pay for here.  Not worth it - tangles uncontrollably and the pieces are centered so they hang funny.
1.0,This is a poor product and should not be posted for sale. The material is very thin amd see through
1.0,No me agrado por que el size small es muy ancho y comparado con las anteriores que he comprado de la misma marca estas son muy grandes y el material es muy sencillo.
1.0,These are the smallest large and extra large capris that I have ever seen.  They seem like children‚Äôs or juniors sizes.
1.0,"This bag is fabulously cute, but made utterly useless by its terrible straps. Unless you are a five year old child or a massive Amazon of lore, this book again is not likely to fit comfortably on you because of its straps. The straps are only adjustable to two lengths due to the button snaps: very short or extremely long. The short setting won't fit my arms/back at all. The long setting makes the bag hang all the way to my rear and pull uncomfortably on my shoulders.<br /><br />I wanted to love this, and did love the appearance and size, but will be immediately returning the bag due to the straps. I don't understand why a bag that seems otherwise so well made does not have fully adjustable straps!"
1.0,"Sent it back because the hooks broke when I was putting it on, poorly made.  Don't waste your money.  I know what you are thinking, I tried to wear one too small, but that wasn't it.  IT WAS THE UNIT.  I have several from other manufacturing companies that fit the same with no issues.  The hooks were not sewn into the unit well, several of them dislodged before I even finished hooking them.  Poor quality."
1.0,The gold started changing.
1.0,"Wore two pairs and both immediately ripped. Let‚Äôs see what the others do. So far, would not recommend."
1.0,"Long story short. I bought a pavlok, it stopped connecting one month in. Then it took one WHOLE month for a replacement to come in. And then 3 weeks into using the new one it stopped connecting again. Garbage! I wasted $150 of my hard earned money during this pandemic for no reason. I despise you Pavlok. I advise everyone not to risk your money here. I'm never one to complain about a product like this either, that means something."
1.0,Very disappointed in these. Frames started peeling within a week. I have several other pairs of these in various styles with no issues.
1.0,Very cheap material! See-through I‚Äôm getting a refund üíØüíØüíØ
1.0,Extremely thin. Not worth the price!
1.0,The sizing was fine on this however it came with a stain on the shirt. Had to return.
1.0,We opened the package and the shirt was already ripping at the bottom and it is not sweatshirt material. It is super thin.
1.0,Zipper broke and had to pay to return it.
1.0,"The pattern looked pixelated, like it was printed on the fabric from a photo that was blown up too much! Horrible."
1.0,Does not have the asymmetrical look!
1.0,Sleeves and bodice are two different colors.
1.0,The chain broke after a week of use
1.0,Love the belts but didn't receive metal ring
1.0,"Waaaaaaaay smaller than pictured.... unless the person in the photo is a tiny pixie.<br />This shirt is a tank top, a short one length wise. It's also not loose at all, like shown."
1.0,Not polarized. Waste of money!
1.0,Simply do not work water gets in and they are poor quality
1.0,Change after few wear
1.0,I was so disappointed when I put this dress on. Comes up short on me and I'm only 5'8. And it's made of this stretchy jersey fabric that does not flatter a full figured woman. I bought this for a funeral for my mother-in-law and had to scramble at the last minute because this dress looked absolutely terrible on me. Even my husband who is a people pleaser and often lies to me about how things look to save her marriage even he said it looks pretty bad. Don't waste your money ...pick a different dress made of a definitely different fabric. If you're plus size that is... I guess if you're a size 2 it'll look fine on you.
1.0,"I was so excited about this belly ring. I'd been wearing a dangly one for months, and I really like it, but I'm trying to expand my collection. This item came rather quickly, HOWEVER. It did NOT come with the TOP BALL!!!!!  I am very disappointed."
1.0,"I bought these shoes for my son for Christmas and after the second time he wore them, the blue (light and dark) lights on one of the shoes stopped working. It's highly disappointing. They now just sit there because he gets frustrated Everytime he thinks about wearing them."
1.0,"I purchased this belt so I could pass through electronic checkpoints without having to remove my belt. The first three times that I used it was at the County Courthouse walkthrough electronic monitor, and it worked perfectly all three seperate times. The other day, I went to the local Social Security Administration office, and I walked through their electronic walk-through monitor, and it did not pass--the buzzer went off. Upon closer inspection, it was determined that it was this belt that was activating the buzzer. They double-checked this with their hand-held wans, and the buzzer went off on the security employee's hand-held wans also. So, I can't rely on this belt to give me the mental security of what will happen next and when and where I may need to use it in the future. I paid dollars for this belt that I would not have paid out had I known about this belt's inconsistent characteristics ahead of time. Is this a scam? Or can there be another plausible explanation that I'm not aware of?"
1.0,Wholes throughout leggings
1.0,Broke after 1 wear. The earrings part unraveled from the tassel..made extremely cheaply.
1.0,Absolutely not sized correctly.  Says 5t much bigger than that.  Sure can't use these now.
1.0,The bathrobe is more of a terry/fleece type of material.  It is light weight compared to a Turkish terry bathrobe I have purchased in the past.  Not worth the money I spent on it.
1.0,This product was awful. It‚Äôs made of super flimsy material and it smells awful. We returned it right away. Don‚Äôt waste your money. It‚Äôs not worth it at all.
1.0,I thought it was a mistake its so tiny.
1.0,"Two different orders, both of them, one leg is shorter then the other."
1.0,Took over a month to receive them and they look nothing like the picture. Too small for me so I gave them to my daughter.

1.0,Gold coat wore off.
1.0,Very small.  More like a kids top.
1.0,Got my leggings and opened them and they had a hole in them. Fit great but not the best quality.
1.0,Disappointed not a sport shirt but more of a pajama shirt
1.0,The right shoulder strap and brest panel seam was completely unraveled right out of the shipping package‚òπÔ∏èNo return slip to mail/exchange
1.0,This thing is made of cheap materials and right out of the package it stunk and already was ripping at the seams. Never buy this shirt you will be disappointed.
1.0,I ordered this dress and ordered two sizes larger than I normally do. It was still far to small. I reordered and got the largest size and it fit okay. I normally wear between an 8 and 10. I also had to add an underskirt as the skirt was completely see through and only one layer.  I would not order from this company again.
1.0,"I received these sunglasses and at first was very happy, until I noticed the arm piece (that goes over ear) on one side was very loose. I took it to a store assuming it just needs a tightening but that wasn't the case. The loose side has a screw that is half the size of the other normal one, and therefore do not stay on your head! I notified them of the defective item and they tried to brush me off to go address this with luxottica! I am not going to waste my time calling/writing/mailing with luxotica when it was C.S sunglasses who sold me the defective item.<br />I am filing a complaint with amazon and demanding this to be addressed."
1.0,They have a hole in the thigh area
1.0,This dress is cute I got a small and I‚Äôm 5 ft 1 in and it was wayyyyy to long for me so I haven‚Äôt worn it out

1.0,These looked somewhat different than the pictures. They are very small and had weird smell.
1.0,Bought for my son. Broke within one week. Very disappointed
1.0,I sent these back because they arrived damaged.  They are cheap and not worth the money.
1.0,Looked like an oversized night dress. The floral pattern was very cartoony-not like the picture. Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,It fit like something extra small and I ordered a medium.
1.0,"I have ever purchased on Amazon. The fabric is sky blue pure elastic, the size 6 pants were 3 inches short for my average height and the waist literally went up to my boobs! üòÇ"
1.0,The jewelry was so cute for my 6 year old but she never got to put it on. It broke right when I took ot iu of the package to wrap it for Christmas
1.0,I ordered an XS and the shirt is extremely long and oversized - it fits like a Medium.  Very dissapointed.  Wish I could return it.
1.0,"I chose these not for the price but because they were individually wrapped.  The low price seemed to be a bonus; however, now I understand why they were priced so low.  These masks are not individually wrapped and I received a package of only 10.  The masks are also pretty thin.  I would not recommend purchasing. I guess the only good thing is that I am only out $3.60"
1.0,This was awful the lights stopped working 1-2 mins after putting them on and the glitter started falling off first wear
1.0,"The skirt was so inexpensive, I figured it would run small, but OMG!  - Cute though :)_"
1.0,I bought two of these shirts same size 4. One fit right but the this one was too small. They do look cheap. Poorly made.
1.0,"It didn‚Äôt even cross my mind to inspect the items for cleanliness upon receipt, however, my shirt happened to get turned inside out and that‚Äôs when I saw the staining in the picture. I understand that things can happen, but I don‚Äôt expect to receive a dirty item that needs to be worn. Although the price point is better than some other costumes, I‚Äôm not happy to have spent $70 on dirty items and am so glad that I happened to see the filth prior to actually wearing the items."
1.0,necklace is so pretty but turned after literally one wear luckily it was cheap ‚Ä¶ you get what you pay for!
1.0,i did not received my item  would have really like a new one but was too afraid too try my luck and it get lost in the mail
1.0,Does not look as the picture. It's a cheap fabric. It looks shiny and small too.
1.0,Completely ripped from all seams. Do not buy!! Had them on for 1 hour and ripped.
1.0,I order a Small and it is way to big it fits my friend who is is a 2Xl so I wasted money on a top that I loved and now can‚Äôt even wear. Sizes are not true at all. Very upset. I would give a -5 star if I could
1.0,"It says one size fits all, but tag on dress said medium and top portion was too big for XS"
1.0,I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt like the case at all. Because it‚Äôs so big in the sides all the tobacco falls into my pocketbook or wherever else the case is. I stopped using it when all my tissues were full of tobacco
1.0,Was so cheaply made. This is something you‚Äôll want to wash after getting it dirty. It became hard after washing one spot out. The neck strap is not adjustable and it sat from my wife‚Äôs stomach to knees
1.0,These shorts are made of cheap fabric and they have no lining so you can see through them üò°
1.0,"Really disappointed. As some have stated, the stripes are missing (not a big deal), but the bigger problem was the fit. There were gaps in the front on the legs with what I can only describe as excess material. And in the back, it barely covered at all with both butt cheeks hanging out and barely coming above the hips. Very uncomfortable even though I did as suggested and ordered a L when I usually wear a M."
1.0,"I bought this, washed it‚Ä¶. And it now fits my 9 year old. The arm length goes about half way down my arm and stops. Fricken ridiculous. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1.0,This is not something to use in place of a mask as it does not seal snugly around the sides.
1.0,"It was sewn off so bad, the fingers  are dis figured. Very noticable and unattractive"
1.0,the lens on the glasses broke right when i took the glasses out. will be returning
1.0,"Bad quality It is not stainless steel, it looks very poor quality as if it were plastic"
1.0,"very cheap product, in the process of returning the item.  It looks like something my daughter would use to play dress-up"
1.0,I returned it.  It was useless to me and I ordered the largest size I could get.

1.0,These glasses broke within a week of wearing them.
1.0,"Its to big,"
1.0,My strap broke in less than a month.<br />Yet another thing gone wrong. Zipper fell apart.
1.0,I asked for rose gold and it looks like old faded rusty gold that was used. Did not like it at all. It almost looked tarnished.
1.0,Dress is very small
1.0,"I did not like the fit, after a few washes they were destroyed."
1.0,"The elastic on the waist twists. Hard to manage.<br />Im usually small, I ordered XL, its snug on the waist and end up too short in lenght. I will be returning this product."
1.0,I wish i would off went one size small
1.0,Only 3 pair sent not 6 pair as advertised in photo and description. Will be contacting seller for correction then I‚Äôll open and review quality.. so far I really like colors.

1.0,Bought for daughter. Terrible quality and short !
1.0,I did not get what was pictured essential
1.0,Not worth it..waited two moths for it..
1.0,Fabric is awful
1.0,"Not as explained, does look as pictured, size is not accurate."
1.0,Ordered a size 9.5 received a size 9. Returned and reordered. Received the wrong size again. Should not list a size you do not carry
1.0,"Slow shopping, cheap quality material, the color not as the listing !<br />Big disappointed:("
1.0,It‚Äôs nice material but it‚Äôs extremely small it might fit my 125lb daughter. It was kind of disappointing because I was wanting to wear them.
1.0,Too bad it came in with a BROKEN strap. It‚Äôs unwearable.
1.0,I had to send this back because even though the measurements should have fit me it was wayyy too small. Very disappointing.
1.0,This mask is VERY THICK & extremely hard to breath through!
1.0,Had to return. Poorly made. Beads unevenly strung so bracelet appears crooked when on.
1.0,These shoes are very poor quality! The entire sole peeled off of the bottom of both shoes after wearing them only 5 times. I do not recommend these and I will never purchase them again!
1.0,It broke within a week on me .
1.0,"Way different then the photo, disappointed"
1.0,This was made of stiff paper with glitter glued on. It was scratchy and cheap. I threw it away immediately.
1.0,All to small and short
1.0,"This was either defective or just completely misleading. This black shirt version size XL was way too short in the front, and not portrayed as the picture in any way. Sending back."
1.0,Really beautiful bracelet that broke the first time I wore it. Sad.
1.0,"I loved until it just broke yesterday, wish I could return for another one"
1.0,"I bought an L size and no only did not fit, also the length of the dress was shorter too, nothing similar to the picture what in my opinion is the only thing that sells because is not the real product. On this days because of the covid situation it is a nightmare the waiting time it took more than a month and when finally arrive before even check on it I washed for security measurements so this dress was not only A total lie about the product, also I couldn‚Äôt returned it. Please do not buy from this seller they are not serious."
1.0,Wore 3 times and the strap broke. It happened on 2 of the 3 I purchased. Not worth the money spent.
1.0,"I have always gotten the Airplus aloe infused socks.  Love them!  But very hard to find these days.  Since Dr. Scholl is national brand I thought I would try these.  The material on these is super thin, not very soft at all,  and the silicon thread on the bottoms is thick so you can feel it on the bottom of your feet.  So much so that if you're walking on hardwood floors it hurts the bottom of my feet.  On top of that they stink of chemicals with absolutely no lavender scent.  They also shed.  I ended up with fuzz all over my feet and in between my toes as well as all over my floors.  These socks are absolute useless."
1.0,The entire sole ripped off after just 1 week of use.
1.0,All tags on the sweater says GIRL KNIT SWEATER!!!!!....NOT BOYS/GIRLS.  Shame on the advertisers just to make a buck...going back tomorrow.
1.0,Wrong sizes and different from the picture don't buy material is not good too
1.0,Not even close to the correct size. Ordered a small. Was at least an XL. Garment had no size tag so apparently it is one size fits all. Misleading.
1.0,Came empty
1.0,Just realized today that both boots on bottom said size 9 but my daughter just noticed on boot is size 9 and the other is size 10 on the inside of boot. Have to figure how to get this rectified.
1.0,They are not stretchy and very large. I cannot imagine they would fit very many large adults. Would not order again. Only bonus is that they are light-weight. They are unwearable with their size and lack of stretch.
1.0,Ordered xl as per other reviews and they are like a medium at best.
1.0,"Got for layers under my scrubs. I'm 6ft female 150 lbs, slim with long torso and slender arms and 34 C. First bought a large in grey. Fit nice and snug as a compression shirt should and was long enough. Sizing is whacked out. Ordered two more next size up (this one and in grey) and they were ENORMOUS. Had to take in 4 inches on both sides and looks low cut due to huge neck. Even with alterations was not compressive or snug in the least. Sloppy big. Rediculous sizing. Not sure if large was improperly labeled or both x-large colors were improperly labeled. The material is warm but these don't do their job even altered."
1.0,So I wore this for less than a week and it broke. I had it in my nose and I turned it. The entire jewel piece broke off of the L part that goes through my nose. The jewel fell and is lost forever and I was stuck with the L piece in my nose. Super disappointed in this piece of junk. Complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,TRASH!
1.0,it came broken.  the rings and the bracelet chain was broke.
1.0,Super sheer and doesn‚Äôt drape kindly. Hung on every lump and bump on my body and made me look huge.

1.0,Very disappointing. Zippers did move smoothly; blue bag as requested but it had brown strap.
1.0,Muy cencillo de muy mala calidad
1.0,I was very disappointed with these. They are comfy and that's not the issue. They were a gift and never got a chance to wear them. The elastic around the top tell apart. My future daughter-in-law washed them before wearing them as you should. She never got a chance to enjoy them. They are cheaply made.
1.0,Got a whole trying to get them on<br />Run small
1.0,looks cool but hand came loose and spins freely<br />dont recommend
1.0,"I like the look, the fabric, the net screen protection, but no directions included in how to go about to assembleüßê"
1.0,Their really cute! But very tight. If you look at the second picture the stitching looks off. Most likely cheap materials.<br /><br />Edit- it ripped within 3 hrs of wearing.
1.0,"I ordered these for my son for Christmas. He chose them. They arrived quickly. However when he opened them the fabric is very much more mesh than expected and picture (very ‚Äúholey‚Äù). This is not his style so we returned it, easily as always with Amazon."
1.0,"These were a joke, they didn't even come in a box, they rolled up in a bag. I dont know what they used to hold the upper in place for the photo because it has no support, it just flops over. I put them on and there was so much slack i could almost double wrap it.  Another reminder, buy cheap get cheap....."
1.0,The soles fell off these shoes the very first time my daughter wore them. I had to hot glue the soles back on and they just fell right back off the next time she wore them.  Very cheaply made!
1.0,the top hook broke immediately. so cant wear them at all
1.0,Ordered a 2xl and it fits my mother who is a size medium. Way too small. I ordered it big because I have a big chest and am pregnant and it barely fit my mom who is a medium. Definitely too small
1.0,Not all of the gauges came. Only like three pairs came. It was disappointing . Thank goodness I bout another pack of a different kind .
1.0,"This item was cheap, low quality material. Totally see through. The seller is in Japan and only wants to offer 10% of the price for a refund."
1.0,Looks cheaply made.  Won't wear them.
1.0,"This is huge for a large.  Should be listed as an Extra-large.  Neck line is extremely low so be prepared to show a lot of boob or wear a shirt under it. Very disappointed in style, size and quality.  I was hopeful but when I received it, very disappointed."
1.0,I did not like this top. I bought two and both were returned. Fit was ok.
1.0,The cookies were all broken and crumbled up !! Should be at least replaced!!!
1.0,Bad material and it through red everywhere!
1.0,in the picture it looks big but it is small and thin
1.0,Nothing like picture its just a hood and leg hols I can't even explain it and cupless really hahaha the holes for string go all the way up the hood ! This is horrible
1.0,This product was thin and cheap. I won't recommend it to anyone.
1.0,"Too loose, my chest was out in the open"
1.0,"Poorly made! These are super cute but only a couple of times wearing them, the canvas is separating, leaving a hole next to the metal loops for the Velcro."
1.0,Sweater is crap don‚Äôt buy it zipper doesn‚Äôt work it literally broke in one minute started unzipping from the bottom and the collar is ridiculous just stabs you in your neck
1.0,Overly priced for what you get. 1 pin came broken. Extremely difficult to put on. Was expecting higher quality for the cost.
1.0,It is OK for a elementary child not for and adult .The quality look very cheap .
1.0,Buckle broke off of belt after a few uses.  Obviously poorly made.
1.0,I got an xl for my husband which is what he always wears and we decided to give it to our 12 year old daughter instead. She‚Äôs maybe 110 lbs and wears a 6 in pants.
1.0,Too small how do I send it back
1.0,The sole came apart less than 10 minutes of wearing.
1.0,It wasn't close to the size indicated
1.0,"After about a week of usage it wouldn't stay tight. The ""strings"" would loosen and the watch would move around."
1.0,The cheetah print color is so dull. Looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Keep coming to lose dislike
1.0,This band is garbage
1.0,"The arm of these sunglasses came in broken.  I was traveling and could not return it on time.  Since this item is no longer available, I request you t"
1.0,No e recibido mi pedido
1.0,It is very it's very bad very small like infant size cumbered with pic  it's look like infant size
1.0,The photo shows a bright red orange  and royal blue print.  It is actually a maroon and dark navy print..
1.0,"The item looked lovely in the photo, but when it arrived the tree/owl medallion was too large (like a 1980s rapper). I wish that it was made smaller."
1.0,Was SO excited to receive this bathing suit until I opened the package and there was NO sanitary liner to try on the garment and it already had NASTY stains all around the crotch and buttocks area!  Gross.  Returning for a refund!
1.0,"Garbage quality... thin white tee, graphic small and placed oddly.  Look at pics for advertised item vs received item."
1.0,Don't buy these. Just two pieces of wire that aren't even round.
1.0,earrings arrived on time and are super cute! However I opened the package and the post was bent. I tried them on wore them for about 3 minutes took it out and it broke! I am going to reach out to seller to request replacement and give them a second shot.
1.0,Material way too thin. Returned.
1.0,My daughter wore these boots 3 times and the heel of the boot came off and is dangling. Very upset!!!
1.0,"I ordered a XXL and got a small. For a big girl, that made me unhappy. Period."
1.0,"This sweatshirt is made of a thinner material and the pockets are just strange. They're not sewn in all the way around, so they fold over and bunch up weirdly. Not good. I returned this."
1.0,This did not hold up. The rivet that held the buckle to the belt fell off.
1.0,The material so cheap
1.0,"First thing wrong is the hat is shipped in a plastic bag so it arrives crushed. 2nd thing its poorly made with an uneven brim and loose strings everywhere and the fit is off not as far as size but the deepness of the hat won't let it go down on your head enough. And 3rd color is off instead of brown the hat looks red. Save your money here, pugs makes a great $13 1 size fits all brown straw fedora that I only tried to replace with this because my ten year old son won't give me my pugs fedora back, its a good 1 size fits all."
1.0,When rcvd they were crushed.
1.0,"La tela es de muy baja calidad, mi hija a penas se lonprobo oara ver como le quedaba y se descocio en diferentes partes del disfraz. No lo recomiendoy menos por ese precio de venta. Terrible<br /><br />The fabric is of very low quality, my daughter barely tried it on to see how it looked on her and it fell apart in different parts of the costume.  I do not recommend it, less for that sale price.  Terrible"
1.0,Product stated Adult and clearly it was a child‚Äôs size!
1.0,Necklace and earrings must be for little girl
1.0,"Do Not get scammed!<br />They keep deleting my review!<br />I do not want the same thing that happened to me to happen to anyone!<br />1. They have hidden cost<br />2. Shipping, you have to pay to receive it & to return it!<br />3. The material is costume like, NOT silk. It wrinkles terribly. I made the mistake of getting it dry cleaned because I thought due to the wrinkles it looks hideous. Boy was I wrong.<br />4. The measurements are all wrong.<br />5. The breast area is flappy , does not stay up like in picture.<br />6. The beaded part is soo cheap it looks like kids plastic toy beads.<br />7. The color was not as shown in picture.<br />8.the corset is just made wrong and makes you look horrible and sticks out from your butt like a tail.<br />9. It‚Äôs been a hassle trying to return the dress first they wanted me to ship it to china which Ups charged $95, which was more than what I paid (85) . After I went back and fourth they gave me an address in Portland and I had to pay $16 .<br />Moral of the story just don‚Äôt purchase from this story it stinks, customer service, quality!<br />*** update***<br />I just realized these guys keep deleting all reviews, mine(previous) and others are no longer visible.<br />***Update****<br />I ended up paying to ship it back. They agreed on giving me a partial return. It‚Äôs been over 6 months and I‚Äôm still waiting! Absolutely HORRIBLE service!"
1.0,This product does not look like the picture I saw when I purchased it.  Old bait and switch.  I wish Amazon would let one know where a product is coming from such as from a foreign country.  I would not purchase the product.
1.0,Top larger than bottoms. Colors did not match once on.
1.0,"Not thick, not roomy, not sized well.  I was loooking for warm (roomy) bed socks.....not what I expected.<br />I gave the socks to my wife.  Would not do this again."
1.0,"I ordered Two pairs of lightweight womens/ladies Reading Glasses.<br />One pair in sea blue finish and one pair in rich pink finish. Optical Power +1.25 (diopter). I did not receive the correct color or strength. I picked these because of the beautiful colors and strength. I received the brown.black with 2.00 strength. I cannot exchange them either. This is very sad and disappointing. I really loved these colors!!!<br />I ateast would like an exchange now stuck with what i cannot use =""("
1.0,The clasp broke as soon as I put it on
1.0,I don't have this item
1.0,I ended up sending this back the material was like a towel not sweater materal and it has no shape to it. Just kinda lays there
1.0,Came with NO instructions as to how to put it together. Wish it came with instruction or ready to go.
1.0,product arrived damaged.  Visible holes in product top.
1.0,Cheapest quality!! I used them twice and they lose elasticity all around. You put them on and in five seconds they are going down!
1.0,The bands do not stay closed so they were pretty much worthless.  Very disappointing.  ‚òπ
1.0,Too big to go through belt loops
1.0,"I just used this bag for the first time. The outside snap pockets were too hard to snap closed. I was only actually able to get one of them to snap shut. After only zipping the top compartment a few times, the zipper just came off in my hands. The metal had bent and I couldn‚Äôt get it back on properly (even if I could have it was bent wide and I was unable to bend it back). Since I was on a trip, I had to leave it behind as I couldn‚Äôt use it without being able to close it and it was too big to pack in my suitcase to bring home. What a waste of money!"
1.0,Within 1 week the elastic separated.
1.0,"At first,I thought these were great! Super cheap, fit great,super comfortable and I liked the bonus extenders.<br /><br />But after a couple of washes, I noticed that almost all of the cup liners (or whatever that extra padding is called) were falling apart.<br /><br />For some,the fabric around the liners came off,so you are left with the foam inside. This makes it hard to put back into the pocket properly.<br /><br />For others, the entire liner disintegrated into tiny foam pieces that gets everywhere!<br /><br />Super disappointed in these bras. I guess I'll stick with the motherhood maternity bras I used to buy. I've had those for &#62;3 years from a previous baby and they are still in great condition. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,The fit around the mouth area is really weird
1.0,"This was a bait and switch. The bag pictured is not even remotely close to the bag they sent.<br /><br />This bag was not weaved like the bag in the photo, it was 3 times as small, and it was terribly constructed. The bag in the photo has button holes that are made with thread. The one they sent had metal holes. And on top of all that, the straps had damage on them right out of the package.<br /><br />It's also cheap, flimsy, and doesn't even have the smaller side bag that it is supposed to come with.<br /><br />How is this seller even allowed on Amazon? This is ridiculous."
1.0,"I was so excited to find these, ordered 2 packs!  Seems like a great deal, but after 2 washes, they are falling apart.  Not such a great deal after all."
1.0,I‚Äôve purchased these WHITE tanks two different times in two different sizes and they have been falling apart at the seams in the waistline. Sometimes the thread comes out so badly that it‚Äôs wrapped around other items in the wash or like in the picture posted and I have to cut them off. Eventually most won‚Äôt have any stitching at all.<br />Oddly enough we have the black ones as well and there are no issues with those ones.
1.0,"Do not even look at this!! it is not worth, the watch does not even turn on, I have read the instruction, over and over again! I have tried to contact the seller and nothing! I will contact Amazon Customer service now! this is a waste of money!!"
1.0,"I cannot say this strongly enough. I will never purchase jewelry on Amazon after this experience. This was a waste of time and money! The necklace broke completely apart when I attempted to wear it. When I opened the package, one of the main parts was broken. FRUSTRATED!!!"
1.0,"The material is a polyester & is cold (silky like) & wrinkles so would have to iron it. Not what I expected, very cheaply made for the money. Keep looking."
1.0,They are quite small for adults. Fits my 7 year old fine
1.0,Way too small!!!! I ordered another suit the same day in the same size that fits beautifully from another company. Will stick with the other company!
1.0,"My son wore these shoes maybe 3 times and one of them stopped working. Messaged the seller and heard nothing back. Don‚Äôt waste your money on them, and I would never buy from this seller again! Poor customer service!!"
1.0,"Doesn't lock into watch, causing my expensive breakable watch to occasionally fall to the ground."
1.0,"These are a pretty color and seemed well made. Just what I thought I was looking for. I got the 2x to be safe and when I opened the package they looked like a kids size. Seriously, they look like they might fit a 10 year old boy. So the sizing is way off. If I had to guess and tried to order a 5x I bet it would fit like a ladies large."
1.0,"The width of the band is not standard, and therefore does not allow the pin to be seated in the watch's holes, making the band unable to be installed"
1.0,"The stripes were too long and you couldn‚Äôt adjust them, it was made very poorly... don‚Äôt buy this product and the seller doesn‚Äôt want give you your money back"
1.0,I returned them - didn't work for a DD cup.
1.0,Supposed to be adult size but was kid size
1.0,It didn't work. We plugged it in and only 1 spinner would work on 1 setting. Could never get the other one to work at all. The instructions are very basic and there doesn't seem to be a lot of difference in turning switches on or off - at least we couldn't tell because the motors wouldn't work right. We returned it.
1.0,They don't stay put!
1.0,"Great gloves but after wearing about 5 times, the stitching on one glove is failing in three places (and not pressure places)"
1.0,This was a joke it was too small no way is it a coat it's more of a hoodie that's all be careful what you buy online
1.0,"This dress was NOT a 3x. I even had someone that wears an XL try it on and it barely fit them right.<br />The material is thicker than what I though and doesn't have much ""give"" ."
1.0,"The Pink/Red bracelet stained my arm and it lasted 3 days. The Purple Bracelet broke the first time I put it on. I never wore the purple, the red stained my arm, and I've never picked up the other one again. NEVER RECEIVED RETURN LABEL & I PAID $30 for these."
1.0,"It is a beautiful bag when you first see it. However, it has a major design flaw. The glitter is like sandpaper, it damages any fabric it touches. My sweater would get stuck to the bag and shed all over it. It destroyed a satin shirt I had for work. I loved the look and style of it but it went back to Kate Spade a week after I bought it. Would not recommend."
1.0,No even 6 months and the straps won't hold.  My watch keeps coming off.  Not worth it.
1.0,"All fingers, almost no palm space, don't even fit my 2 year old who is only in the 19% for height. Not for toddlers, almost look comical, don't buy this crap, I should have read more reviews."
1.0,"Broke less than a week after I received it. Looked great, but had to send back after it broke. Seller refunded so that was nice."
1.0,"I‚Äôm not sure how to rate the sizing, listing says medium, I recieved xxl, I guess it fits like a mediumish. The material and color is not what it looks like. It‚Äôs bright orange and shiny material. This top looked a little more coral and a cotton material."
1.0,No stretch.
1.0,"In addition to this shoe, I ordered the Maris slide and both of them are just far too narrow in the straps--the footbed is the right size and width but way too tight on the top. As a reference, usually my foot is slightly narrower than a medium width!  Cute shoe and great price but you just don't know what you're going to get."
1.0,I am beyond angry right now! I ordered this beautiful sheer romper and received an ugly swim suit that was wayyyyy too large üò° the material very cheap and it looked nothing like the picture. Do not buy üò§
1.0,it was very small it was not what I expected I had to wait 2 months for it and was not satisfied
1.0,Way to small and cheaply made very disappointed
1.0,These masks are such crap!!! They are not cotton!!! Stretchy very skinny material!!! They are not even safe to wear!!!!  JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!
1.0,Stops keeping time...junk !
1.0,This was one of the worst boots I ever owned.  Being geared for diabetics boots are very uncomfortable and left callous on my feet.
1.0,Picture made it look much better than in person. It was also extremely thin material.
1.0,"Much shorter than expected. I'm 5, 9 and the dress comes to my mid-calf."
1.0,The fabric is cheap and after a washing had no shape left. Wish I had not wasted my money on this.
1.0,Size too small as xl
1.0,"If you order the white dress, it is completely see through! I would not recommend. Very cheap and flimsy. I don‚Äôt usually make returns, but there was no way I could waste my money on this."
1.0,Feels like paper shorts!
1.0,Super cheap looking.  Polyester material looks awful.
1.0,I don't have a clue how it fit because I received a shiny gold tank top? Didn't even take out of the bag and just sent back.
1.0,I wore it because I had to.  Nothing like the picture....the cut and fabric were nothing like pictured.  I'm extremely disappointed!
1.0,The outfit was polyester hate that feeling but what haven‚Äôt wore it since I brought it
1.0,I never received refund‚Äî it‚Äôs a fine costume of expected quality but I never received my money back.
1.0,"Not waterproof at all!! My tennis shoes are more waterproof than these boots.  Also, they came FILTHY! There was dirt and dust all over the shoes, inside and out.  Don't buy these!"
1.0,"I am very disappointed and surprised at the positive comments.  From the chain to the top of the necklace, it does not lay flat at all, so i have not been able to wear it.  It looks cheap--a large version of Barbie doll jewelry. I do not recommend it. Total waste of money."
1.0,They don‚Äôt look right. I thought they were supposed to go up the ear and stay put.
1.0,"I bought these hiking boots because they were supposed to be waterproof.  If you want a waterproof hiking boot, do not buy these boots they are not waterproof. My socks got soaking wet just walking through wet grass."
1.0,"First of all, this product arrived later than expected. Second of all, all the stitching in front was loose and the cross straps completely unraveled when I tried the dress on. Cheaply made, for sure. I can't justify more than one star, I'm sorry. But, just no."
1.0,"After reading reviews I sized up from my normal medium to a XL. I couldn't get my arm in, bodice was so narrow, it would have fit a 2 yr old.  Returned, will avoid this brand in the future. It's been 4 days and I still haven't received a credit.üò†"
1.0,Lenses weren‚Äôt glass as advertised.Sent them back without any issues.
1.0,"The boots were not as expected..They didnt come with any information about them, they seemed like if they just threw the boots in a box n called it a day..They are so freaking heavy, not waterproof, i had to return them.."
1.0,"I loved these earrings and read the reviews. When I received the earrings they had completely different posts on them- very cheap hooks. Not impressed, and very disappointed."
1.0,"I originally bought this ring for my daughter as a memory gift for her grandmother passing away (she loved sunflowers). The first one I bought broke, I figured it may have been a dud so I purchased a second one. Within two months of purchasing and of course after the return date, the ring broke. All my daughter was doing when it broke was resizing it to her finger and it snapped. I will not be purchasing again as this is very cheaply made and not worth the cost."
1.0,Very cheap material and the threats were already coming out when I received the package. It's terrible ugly dress it does not look like the picture posted.
1.0,"Cool looking sunglasses, but the lenses are TOTAL JUNK!!! Distorted view, cheap and flimsy. Will return, don't buy!"
1.0,The colors are bright and the material is really cheap and itchy.
1.0,It's not the expected size of cross bag needed
1.0,Didn‚Äôt hold up a thing.
1.0,"If i could leave no star, that would reflect what i really think of these knit legs. The worst, stretch horribly, fall from my calfs. I asked for a refund cuz if this and because from one pair the tread started to rip."
1.0,These are way to small do not expect the to fit. Keep in mind you have to pay shipping to return the items. Would not recommend buying from this vender.
1.0,Had a tear on the side seem
1.0,These were supposed to be nine earrings not a bracelet. What is this some kind of con?
1.0,"The entire inside seam came undone. Buttons fell off, very poor quality!<br />I purchased a pair and originally loved the fit, so after about 2 weeks I ordered another. Within a month the crotch split on both pair. I sewed it back together, and a week or so later the butt split. The buttons on the pockets fell off one pair and the top waste button on the other came off. I've had $12 jeans last longer and hold up better. I don't like to complain, but I want to try and save someone from wasting their money. I'm out $80 and still need new work pants. Very poor quality!!!"
1.0,This is a very light weight long overlay item. I would not consider a sweater.  No weight to it to keep anyone warm.<br />If your looking for a finish look this is not.
1.0,After a couple hours of wearing it the seam in the arm came apart.
1.0,These run very small and now not an option to return yet when you read details it does say returnable. Very expensive for sweatpants!!
1.0,"Does not look like pictures.  I bought it because I loved the bat arms.  Arms were nothing like pics, very short sleeves.Dislike"
1.0,NOT AS ADVERTISED!!! There is NO adjustable M-shaped nose clip!
1.0,"The craftmanship is very poor. Lettering does not line up on seams, doubled some letters, cannot read other letters, sewn into seam. You should spend a bit more and get quality. This was a gift so I will keep it but very disappointing"
1.0,These pants arrived to me with mildew all over them. I purchased ‚Äúnew‚Äù pants and they were obviously used or returned. The tag was off and the black had rubbed off all over the pants. I didn‚Äôt even open the package. It was disgusting. Luckily Amazon has a gracious refund policy.
1.0,flimsy would never buy again
1.0,"I measured my wrist as the seller suggested and my wrist wasn't too big, according to the information on the product page, but there is no way this case/band is going to fit me. Also, the case is super shiny gold colored, not the brass color that is displayed on the product photos. Wish I had bought something else."
1.0,Way too small !!!
1.0,the fabric quality is very poor.
1.0,Bought 2 of these rings for my granddaughters definitely not sterling silver. Tarnished and turned their fingers green with in a week.
1.0,This does not look as chic as in the pictures. Looks more like a mumu- very much larger than expected and kind of cheap looking.
1.0,Way too cheeky
1.0,There is no bust support what so ever. Cute design but without some kind of support it isn't wearable.
1.0,I normally wear a large but this is VERY large
1.0,Wore the necklace for half a day and it came apart. I am not rough on jewelry.
1.0,Do not purchase! Do not stick. Will be returning
1.0,Cheap crap that will hurt your throat and cut your gums.
1.0,Slid under feet in shoes.
1.0,"Don't waste your time - the elastic in the waist is wayyyy too tight, which causes the dress in the front to gap between buttons. Terrible design. The rest of the dress fits just fine and is true to size, but you'd need to size up to where the elastic isn't needing to stretch at all in order to avoid the gaping in front."
1.0,Not true to size if you are a large order 2 sizes up.  Rums very small
1.0,Found an 18 pc set for the same amount
1.0,It is to small and does not feel as it appears to look stretchy and comfortable.
1.0,Horrible!  The blue dye got all over my son's face the first time he wore them.  If I could give zero stars I would.  This shouldn't happen on any sunglasses let alone kids.  Some basic product colour fastness tests were missed.  Horrible!
1.0,Material was thin enough to see thru. Not good quality especially for working out.
1.0,Doesn't fit right and uncomfortable.
1.0,"Meh- the chiffon part of the dress came snagged, but the dress itself was too short. I am 5'8 and carry more weight in my butt and this just wasn't flattering. Back it went."
1.0,"The label said it was an XL, but it was sized more like a medium.  This made them completely useless to me."
1.0,The pants aren't true to size. The length of the pants are for petite women. I'm 5'7 1/2.
1.0,"This top is not the same as the pic. The material an style is different. Poor quality made, the front scoops to low. The back is to short. Will not buy from this Company again."
1.0,Diamonetts are falling out
1.0,Was using it for my phone and it broke off within a couple hours of getting it...not good quality do not recommend
1.0,"Ridiculously small.  Looking for XL and this has 26"" waist.  Must be Oriental sizing."
1.0,"These beads are tiny!  What is this, a bracelet for ants?!  But really, they are small and the string has no stretch so they are impossible to get on even a small wrist.  Do not buy these.  Seller:  Better pics/descriptions please."
1.0,Don't bother...Dollar Tree quality. I sent it back
1.0,"Upate after 2 weeks.<br />A tight fit is not a good thing. After sitting inside for a few days I went to take them with me to the pool and they were broke. Looks like the pressure from the lenses cause them to break apart. I remember one side was a lot tighter than the other. That's the side that broke. I hate giving them a bad review but now I have to throw them away...<br /><br />These are exactly what I was looking for. Polarization is better, lenses are a more natural color and not a grey/blue color.<br />Fitment was a little tight but I feel better knowing that won't come out easy."
1.0,Impossible to get on my feet. Do not buy
1.0,"I'm very disappointed with this purchase. I have ordered before and loved my rings but this one is very light and cheap looking.<br />Very tiny stones<br />Update- 1/6/2020<br />Worn a week- took it off to sleep, shower, wash dishes and a stone fell out already."
1.0,So excited to get these. I have tries to wear them for a few days and I absolutely hate them. They dont stay put and make it so uncomfortable. I would rather throw them in the garbage than ever have to wear them again. I would avoid at all cost. I wouldnt except them for free if that is any indicator.
1.0,Horrible only lasted on month next time you say cargo shorts they better be Carhartt not this crap
1.0,"The fabric is very thin and see-through. I ordered size XL and received size Small, so it wasn't even close to a good fit."
1.0,I would not recommend this shirt.  This shirt is made for Asian Men size. I had a hard time getting returning label from the seller. I would never order anything from the individual sellers.
1.0,Dislike zipper broke
1.0,"Cheap looking, bend easy poor quality"
1.0,Cheaply made return
1.0,Typo in writing in baseball<br />I‚Äôm very disappointed!<br />My son opened this Christmas morning with a typo!
1.0,Mine are also lost in the mail
1.0,I purchased this band on August 8th and loved it up until two days ago when the band started to separate from the mounting bracket. It is only happening on one side of it so I don't know if it would happen again or if it was just this band. I wear it everyday and have been very satisfied until this happened.  I am rating it for a one star for quality because it has only been a month and a half and the band is now falling apart and I believe that it should last longer than that.  This was the first band I purchased so I don't know if this is just a problem with all silicone bands or just this brand.
1.0,"Fabric - yucky  and cheep , construction @ waist not flattering nice print -"
1.0,"These were kinda itchy, and they ripped the first day I wore them."
1.0,Fit as expected and the style is what we wanted. Just sad they used such cheap material for the outer shell. After just 1 use it started to shred for no reason at all.
1.0,Cheap junk.  Won't fit larger head.  Lenses are cheap thin plastic
1.0,Strange fit. Odd material.
1.0,"Came crumpled in a small bag, covered in wrinkles. I could not steam or iron the wrinkles out. Tried washing and drying it per the instructions, and still couldn't get out the wrinkles. It was unwearable and I returned it."
1.0,Dress fit as expected however the bust area had pleated material and it was not flattering at all dropped down low on the sides.
1.0,I don't know  why I haven't learned when clothes are from another country and they are adapting their sizes to US sizes the fit is always off.  I thought these athletic shorts looked good and wanted lightweight.  I went by their bizarre sizing chart and got a XL.  They are huge on me and most importantly are extremely heavy and not lightweight at all.  I got the size they said and I can pull them up to my belly button.  Sadly off to Goodwill these will go.  Cannot recommend.
1.0,Dress us very flimsy- and fit is 2 to 3 sizes too small
1.0,"Only 15 out of 40 actually worked, very disappointed about that. I think they should all be checked or double checked before shipping."
1.0,"Ordered a medium for my husband and it was way too small. Very tight, he could barely get it on. Also it‚Äôs fleece which i didn‚Äôt know before ordering. So it was something that was too hot for him to wear as a sleep shirt. It really looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,The store did not carry size 10.but nice looking shoe
1.0,This product looks cute when opened. But the seams are not even and pull apart within one day.  One side of the seams was on the side of the leg‚Ä¶the other leg seam was behind the leg.  They‚Äôre cheap for a reason.
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt magnify even a little and gets stuck. Sent it back.
1.0,There is a black Mario in this???? These are not like the picture.
1.0,The necklace is so &#34;cheap&#34; looking;  It is overpriced at $9.99.  It is of the quality I would expect to find at a dollar store.  I am extremely disappointed.  It looks a thousand times better in the picture.
1.0,"Unit is small and battery powered which is what I needed to store in my home safe. AC never worked, batteries did which is fine as that is why I ordered it. Worked fine for first 35 days then quit working. Since it was outside of 30 days I couldn't return to Amazon. When I contacted third party seller for repair, replace or return their response was Dear Customer, Thank you for your support! Any question feel free to contact us. Best regards,<br />OLYMBROS. Horrible response. However when I contacted Amazon they provided me with a return label and allowed me to return for refund, as I am a Prime member. As for watch winders, this is my third one and I have yet to find one that lasts more than 6 months. Kudo's to Amazon for taking care of their customers. Not so for Olymbros."
1.0,They are not worth it they are not 1 inch they are way smaller not happy
1.0,Very light weight and they do not hang very well. Disappointed in the quality
1.0,Not good at all. Starts to fall off within 10 minutes.
1.0,Very cheap. Way too small for size expected.
1.0,"Material is sheer and skirt feels very cheap. I ordered from this brand before and was thrilled with the quality, but the skirt was a ruched poly-blend material. This skirt is cheap cotton-blend material with some stretch but the low quality of the fabric distorts the print when you have the skirt on. Honestly, I bought 2 of these skirts and wanted to return both, but I missed the return window. Definitely not worth the price and not the quality I expected to receive from Vivicastle"
1.0,Dislike  the top
1.0,Extremely mis-sized. Xl was like a size 12 dress.
1.0,This is horrible!! The material isn't even denim. It's some funky grey color that resembles medical scrubs. Don't waste your money. It looks NOTHING like the picture!
1.0,This pair of large pants are way too long.  Disappointing. Not sure I'd buy from them again.
1.0,Made very cheap and runs rather snall
1.0,These pants are way to big and way too long I love the color though. RM
1.0,"This ""shirt"" is barely ""made""......the sleeves are unfinished w/no hem at all...and same goes for the bottom area......its like it was just barely done. The fit  is weird...the fabric is so flimsy that the sleeves are like a tissue in the wind...I have never seen a more unfinished shirt........Super poor quality..."
1.0,Love the idea of these but they wouldn‚Äôt stay on my ear right unless I tightened the top around my ear which hurt. Not happy. I really wanted these to work. Super cute just won‚Äôt stay on ears right
1.0,got medium and its nothing like the pic in regards to lengths. too short and im 5.5
1.0,"Too short, too small( like 2 sizes!), NOT pink it‚Äôs more peach, couldn‚Äôt even put my arms down."
1.0,One arm broke off before I could even wear them.  Should have been expected for the price.
1.0,Poorly made. Material wrinkle and distorted
1.0,"Not only is this not seamless, but its made of a felt like fuzzy material on the outside. AND COMES WITH A PULL TIE. UGH. THIS IS NOT WEARABLE."
1.0,"This is the second purse I have purchased from this company. I really like the outside pockets and pouches. I like the over the shoulder look as well. However, the inside of the the purse is terrible. The fabric just falls apart. I‚Äôve had this one for a month and it‚Äôs just shredded. If there‚Äôs one thing to fix it‚Äôd be the inside."
1.0,"Fabric and fit both icky, I returned right away."
1.0,"The stud literally detached from the tail and fell out of my nose. It often unscrews and falls to the floor. It's happened several times, yet this time I couldn't find it so that was a waste of money! The L bend is also super short which makes inserting it a hassle. It took literally more than 30 mins & it left my nose sore & tender. I see why it‚Äôs so cheap!"
1.0,The band separated from the linkage that attached it to the watch within a week.
1.0,"These are fine if you are already skinny and have no need for compression. The compression band is not as wide as other leggings I have found and they fit weird...like the compression band gives you the opposite of a muffin top...in order to get the crotch part pulled up enough the compression part is actually over the part of my belly that I need it to help suck in. Not flattering. Also, I knew they would be thick but these (fleece lined version) are definitely only for fall/winter. They are not for summer time in the south, for sure. I will go back to the other brand I have found from Walmart."
1.0,I was not able to use these laces at all because they are very shoddily made and one of them was completely faulty and unusable when it arrived. They were flimsy and the inside was spilling out of the thread wrapping. I would definitely never buy them again.
1.0,"You definitely get what you pay for! Would not recommend, shirt arrived and was thin, had several spots of holes when held up to light. Will be returning as Company didn‚Äôt even respond."
1.0,My son wore them for one week before they got a hole in the toe!
1.0,I've ordered these handles twice and they have broken both times. They are not worth it.
1.0,i didn't get any of the rings that were picturered. All the rings I received were at least a size eight. They looked like giant O-rings
1.0,Just wasn't what I had expected... :(
1.0,"This is waaaaay too small! I have an average size nose. It hurts my nose while wearing it, so I'm going to have to buy a different one. This clicker is adorable and if it was bigger I would have given it 5 stars."
1.0,These rings are probably a size 4 and do not fit any of my fingers. I do not recommend.
1.0,This is what you get. It‚Äôs not at all what is pictured. Pretty aggravated about this and extremely annoying this is allowed to happen on Amazon. Didn‚Äôt even get a gem with this.
1.0,"I want to return this item. Too small, the material feels like a napkin. I usually wear a large and ordered an extra large. The shirt fits like a size medium. The seller emailed me and asked if I would take a 40% refund with no return. Well that would be fine if the shirt actually fit! I emailed back and offered to exchange it for a different item and haven't heard back from them."
1.0,GOLD PLAY HAVE NO GOLD.NOTHING. GOLD FILLED OK.
1.0,This product immediately fell apart. Would not buy this product again.
1.0,"Loved the dress, to bad it was defected, zipper was bad button fall out, very disappointed."
1.0,"El material denota un producto muy barato, de p√©sima calidad, se deforma f√°cilmente."
1.0,"This loop is very small and the magnification....sucks. In hindsight, it's not worth my time and energy to see if this loop can be of some use....it wasn't and I returned it pronto."
1.0,Too big for a one year old
1.0,"When I got this, I noticed that there was a big white stain on the back of it.  I thought I would put it on just to try it out, though, because I wanted to make sure it fit ok before I ordered another one.  I put it on, and the left side of the neckline was longer than the right side, making it wrinkly and puckered on that side while it laid flat on the right.<br /><br />I returned it, and decided not to re-order."
1.0,Not made for a female looks like a man band
1.0,This is crap. The beads all turned green after one day and it is extremely difficult to open and close. Usually have to use pliers.
1.0,"Overall, disappointed in this hat.  I ordered a medium, but it is larger than my other size large hats.  Additionally, the hat is very lightweight (i.e., flimsy) and is nearly impossible to mold into the shape shown in the picture.  Lastly, the color of the hat is nothing like that shown in the picture.  It is a very golden color, rather than the white or off-white shown.  For the price, this hat is a poor value."
1.0,Bought it son loved it broke replaced it and broke again
1.0,One earring has 3 missing pearls...the design is so pretty and I was really looking forward to wear the earring. Thoroughly disappointed:-(<br />Edit : just noticed the packaging in the picture another buyer has posted for this piece. That looks much better. The piece on the back holding the earring in its place is different too. How can you have so much variation for 1 model? I am returning this right away.
1.0,This watch looks way better in the photo than in reality. I couldn't get the time set or the watch to even work. It went out with the next day's trash.
1.0,"I am ENORMOUSLY disappointed in this purchase. I received this in the mail at 2pm Saturday afternoon, only opened the box and wore it around 6pm, and it is now 2am Sunday morning and there is already a stone that's fallen out! I don't know where and when it happened in the last few hours but I noticed it about 30 minutes ago after inspecting the ring this afternoon. I'm not usually so harsh with my star ratings, but that's just unacceptable. All I've done tonight is eat dinner, and do paperwork!"
1.0,when they are on they stretch to a point where they become very very shear at 4 places on the sock...  This was in the same place with each pair ... you can see your foot as there is barely any thread or material on the sock in these places.  (size 10 shoe )
1.0,To small for an apron
1.0,"Way too heavy.  Poor quality, and way too big"
1.0,It's a sticker on a beanie
1.0,This brand of compression sleeves are not near the quality of other brands.  Sizing not for normal ankle and calves.  Material used is also substandard.
1.0,Too big for me.  Don't bother.
1.0,Way too small. Size chart is completely wrong.
1.0,Run small poor quality
1.0,I received  it and things were opened and missing like it was used before.
1.0,What they don‚Äôt tell you in the description is how small the message is - you need the Hubble Telescope to read the ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù message
1.0,This was incredibly difficult to work around the car seat and didn‚Äôt stay on well. I returned it.
1.0,The key chain was broken and I couldn't open the card pocket.
1.0,This item was poorly made. The clasp broke twice and then I only received 80% of my refund due to post office delays. Bad experience and don‚Äôt recommend.  DEFINITELY not worth the 85 dollars.
1.0,Bought for my TOZO watch but wouldn‚Äôt stay on the watch - didn‚Äôt fit.
1.0,"Have initiated a return as I thought it was 2 aprons and it is not the style that I wanted.  Did not see in the details that the ties loop down from the neck to create the waist tie, not conducive to what it was needed for."
1.0,The product was sized too small and way too long
1.0,"Costs way too much, felt I was rip off and on top of it didn't fit my watch or my wrists."
1.0,"This broke after one year of normal use. It also became warped / bent and the holes have been stretched. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù and ~155lbs. I bought a synthetic / man-made replacement belt from Walmart for $10, which looks exactly like this one. I would not purchase this belt again; it is not worth the money."
1.0,I was under the impression l was buying Tommy Cooper shirts
1.0,cant fit a computer
1.0,PEQUENO MUY CORTO
1.0,"Product says tummy control  that's a laugh they fit nice feel ok but no control, slimming  nothing. Plus I wore before I washed and got a rash. Now I find out no returns. Just wont buy from this seller ever"
1.0,i couldn't walk more than five feet without having to take off my shoes and pull the sock back over my heels.  i don't recommend/
1.0,Cheap doesn‚Äôt stay closed
1.0,CCC...Cheap China Crap.
1.0,Band did not fit on my brother‚Äôs Fitbit as the piece where the metal pins were suppose to connect were too thick of a padding and was unable to fit it. If it was slightly less thicker where the metal pin holds onto the watch it would have been fine
1.0,Adhesive is terrible! So not work it! Can't even contact seller for refund  doesnt work At all
1.0,Returned immediately.  It broke the first moment I tried it on straight from the mailing package.
1.0,jewel was missing from one of them upon arrival.
1.0,These say age 8-16. They are nowhere near big enough. I bought them for my 12 year old who fits in the age range. They do not fit my 8 year old nephew. These would maybe work great for a toddler.
1.0,This was of poor quality but served us well for a one time Halloween costume for baby. Was way oversized. The hat fits my 3 year old.
1.0,Looks cheep and feels cheep. Does not look like a high quality chain it does look like you spent $12 on it.
1.0,The band snapped one day after I purchased it.
1.0,This is an automatic watch has runs based on movement.  This watch was defective as it would not keep running while on the wrist.  I returned the watch and bought a Timex.
1.0,"Very cheap material,  does not look like the picture!"
1.0,I bought 2. The first one broke while trying to put it on. The unicorn fell of the second one within a few days.
1.0,Didn't even glow. Very disappointed.
1.0,Love the T-shirt..however it smelt like vinegar
1.0,Don't buy! Better off with Dollar Store glasses.
1.0,One wear and wash and the seam came undone in the waist . Very disappointed.
1.0,I don't like the material and it's humongous!  Doesn't look like picture.. it's very boxy looking and not flattering whatsoever.
1.0,They lasted less than a month before showing stains similar to rust.<br /><br />Very disappointed.
1.0,"Sleeves extremely tight, out of proportion!"
1.0,"Read the sizing chart and ordered accordingly but they were so small it was like I was wearing a little kids shirt. I‚Äôm a small to medium at forever 21 or top shop, for reference."
1.0,"Poorly made, not as pictured.  Sent back."
1.0,It was to slim
1.0,too cheeky for me
1.0,It bulges in the back and the shoulder straps slightly loose. Item need to be returned however I do not want to pay another $36.70 to have have item returned as before. This is just not working for me. Very disappointed. And to make matters worse instead if the Nivea I paid being reimbursed to me I'm being given done kind of promitional credit and here I am again stuck with with a product I can use. I spend too much at Amazon to have to deal with this kind of treatment.
1.0,"As a size 18 I could've ordered a smaller size, maybe a large instead of a 2X. I didn't notice anymore sweat in my stomach region versus my other body parts.  It rolls up which is very annoying. There are better products out there."
1.0,"Love the color but there is no way they fit a 26 in. calf.  They are way to tight and cut into my calf.  Could only wear for short time.  Don't buy these if your calf measures 20"" or larger."
1.0,son mas grandes de las originales
1.0,I really like the bracelet but after a month and a half its coming apart in 2 places and now I'm passed the return date.
1.0,Hate. I just look like a slob. There is no shape.
1.0,"I like the watch, but it wasn't working upon arrival.  I assume the battery is dead but don't know for certain.  There was no protective tab to pull and start the battery running.  The date on the box is 2012 which may or may not explain things.  The face of the watch is easy to see even when the watch is in the case, so someone could have easily checked to see if it was working before shipping."
1.0,"Despite the low quality plastic, this umbrella works, but maybe they should have removed the price tag so I didn't know that I was boned for an extra $10. I obviously paid for the free shipping anyway."
1.0,"These were supposed to be latex free, they aren't. I am allergic to latex, I put the socks on and right away my legs started itching"
1.0,The quality is bad. Looks so cheap
1.0,This did not work! Fell apart
1.0,Could never use it because one of the screws was missing that locked it to my device.
1.0,Not what I thought it was received the item really late could not even send it back for a refund the shirt itself is extremely cheap looking not worth the 12 bucks more like a $3 shirt that I paid $12 for.
1.0,this item is shown in a short sleeve yet was delivered to me in a long sleeve and looks so cheap. i am so disappointed
1.0,very bad quality you can see your underwear  and the material get sticky to your skin i feel a lot Electricity  wearing this dress i sent back
1.0,its itchy not what i expected
1.0,Wrong size don‚Äôt have them yet!
1.0,"Received these for Christmas because it was on my wish list, but to keep it a surprise my in-laws did not purchase directly from my wish list, so my review is going to show up as &#34;unverified.&#34; Pardon in advance.<br /><br />I know I chose &#34;somewhat small&#34; as the fit, but I wish there is a &#34;awkward fit&#34; instead. I am 5'5, 120 pounds.<br /><br />The toes section fit a bit tightly... the first three toes fit a bit too tightly and the smaller two toes swim in the socks. The material does not conform/stretch appropriately so that the arch section is always &#34;hanging&#34; and there is a pretty big empty gap between my arch and the middle of the socks.<br /><br />But that's not what drives me crazy the most...<br /><br />What's worst, is that the heel section is too low while the top part of the foot is too long, so when I wear it, it constantly feel like the heel is going to slip off, even though it probably won't. Because of this,it appears very lopsided on my ankle,creating a strange gap between my long leggings and the socks on the top of my heels.<br /><br />Functionally, it works in class, but it's very distracting to me.<br /><br />I don't know if it's just my pair or every pair, but I cannot recommend it based on my experience so far.."
1.0,"Demasiado grande la camisa , pedi numero 2 y me mandaron XL , soy peque√±a y delgada x lo tanto no me queda la camisa , ademas estaba sucia la camisa tenia dos mancha de maquillajes de mujer ."
1.0,Bad fabric sheer
1.0,had two different socks in package one short and one up to knee which was right one.. paid $9.99 per pair to get these easy on easy off socks..very upsetting can't wear them
1.0,"This is a nylon material, it is horrible!<br />And the color is bright yellow, and I do mean bright! Not the gold color like pictured. Do not waste your money on this!"
1.0,This is not in women's sizes. I got an xxl and the hoodie fits my sister in law that is a size 2. Do not buy this product!!
1.0,The one I starting wearing right away has already turned gold....
1.0,I received a totally different ball cap. No Oakley symbol and was not a fitted style cap...had to return it.
1.0,snapped in half while i was wearing it. didn't even strain it. cheap metal that is easily snapped<br />aahhh a
1.0,"Ad listing is for 5 masks. A sticker has been placed on the box changing it to 3.<br />Made in China of very thin cheap fabric.<br /><br />No nose wire in masks even though the very first direction on the box is to ""Press and fix the nose wire along the nose shape""<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money."
1.0,This necklace is cute but obviously inexpensive.  It broke the first time I wore it.  I will be able to fix it as the links just came apart but who wants to deal with that every time you wear it?
1.0,Color not right rose gold is tan! Also not good for wider wrist
1.0,The part that's suppose to turn to mark seconds does not work. I've had cheaper watches which it does. The interior dials aren't able to set. I've had better luck with much cheaper watches. The only thing going for it is that it's a nice dress watch.
1.0,terrible fabric. All the color washed out within 1 wash. Very disappointing.
1.0,Super cheap quality. Does not stay on around the biceps and the wrist is super loose. Terrible quality.
1.0,"While this headband is cute, it is basically a loop of stretchy fabric, it is something that should cost no more than $1 and you buy at your local dollar store."
1.0,Dress ripped after 3rd wear. It‚Äôs a pretty dress and I‚Äôll fix it but needs to be better quality.
1.0,fits well. zipper is on the wrong side.<br /><br />Update: liner started falling out in about 2 months. Don't buy.
1.0,"Does not work, peels off easily"
1.0,It turned my neck green within a couple days of having it the chain and the turtle
1.0,these are not plus size
1.0,Mine broke on one end in less than three months and I let them know and they didn't offer to replace it. Also the ends lost the color and look tarnished.
1.0,Muy mala calidad se quebr√≥ el sujetador
1.0,Do to all that going on was unable to return miss my dateline. Very cheap bubble gum jewelry is way nicer.
1.0,"Cheap! Its colorful but its cheap, and doesnt fit well. The chain is crap and broke the first time wearing it...."
1.0,The sterling silver tarnished within 3 days. I took them out before my shower and made sure they were always dry - the part that tarnished was the part that went into my ear. This made my ears swell
1.0,Very cheap and unfinished.  Not at all as described.
1.0,The zipper broke in 4 days and then handles unraveling.  Cheaply made.
1.0,Looked great On website but quality was not good. Made of plastic and has not wheigt making it uncorfortable
1.0,Sparkles fell off just from opening the dress. Not flattering at all. Made poorly
1.0,I bought this as a gift for my niece. It didn't last 3 months. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Worthless.  We purchased these for our 3 year old and her hands where frozen after just 30 min at 20 deg F. They ripped, where soaked, we returned them.  Really poor quality, why don't they make children s gloves with good fabric and excellent insulation, they are tiny kids and there is so little fabric, you would think the cost of cutting and stitching would make it that much easier to absorb better materials.  I am going to take a look at O.R. or someone else that still has a good name in quality."
1.0,I normally wear a medium and chose a size large for roominess in the summer. These were tight across my hips and butt even with the increased size.
1.0,They would be much nicer if they had the pattern on both sides.
1.0,They are advertised as silver but came as gold. I don‚Äôt wear gold. I‚Äôll have to use as gift. Very disappointed.
1.0,This shirt is a yellow gold just awful
1.0,Purse was defective and had to return.  The heart pattern was sideways on the front and correct on the back. I was very dissapointed...was charged a fee for returning.
1.0,I would give this product 0 stars. Didn‚Äôt even wear once and they broke. Cheap cheap cheap metal. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"Bought an extra small and it was way too big. Best way to describe this dress, it could be used as a costume in a stage production in You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. :-/"
1.0,"I bought (3) of them as I normally have travel that requires (3) shirts. The product is made well, but these are too big, they take up far, far too much space in your suitcase and are heavy. Communication with them was great during the ordering process, but I have been trying to return them for a week now and they will not respond. I‚Äôm going back to using the bags my shirts came inas there are no more or less wrinkles than using this item, 95% less weight and (3) shirts will fit in the space of less than (1) of these."
1.0,"This was suppose to be fleece lined and it was just a regulat flannel.  Its great quality for a regular flannel, but I wanted a fleece lined flannel which it was NOT."
1.0,Way bigger than the picture and horrible stiff material!!! It was folded in half when they shipped it and it's stuck like that and when I put stuff in it you see the fold. Do not get this bag!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Tore the first time wearing them. Had to throw them away
1.0,Fits tiny it‚Äôs like for a toddler
1.0,Los venden como amarillos y te mandan anaranjados üòêüòÆüòíüëé
1.0,These are fraying and falling apart after less than a month of wear.
1.0,cheaply made yet expensive
1.0,These are not worth getting. Don‚Äôt work & don‚Äôt stay on glasses at all. Look cheap with the stick on ‚Äúanti scratch‚Äù pieces of tape. Not worth sending back. No issues with seller or fast delivery.
1.0,The foil on the metal chipped away after pinching it closed. I even cushioned the tool. Thought that might help but didn‚Äôt.
1.0,"If you are in the US it takes too long to get products from this company, not worth it!!! Feels like the 1950's again"
1.0,I normally wear a size medium - 28 inch waist - but I ordered an XL going by their sizing chart. It fit more like an extra small. Sizing was completely off.  Dress was beautiful though.
1.0,"This watch died relatively fast, basically in the couple of months, that actually surprised me, because my men watch from the same brand works just perfectly after one year of ownership."
1.0,"I was so excited about these as I spend a lot of time messing with my goggles.  They were willing to try a second time, but at that point refunded saying they wouldn‚Äôt be able to fit my face.  So back to Nike goggles.  If you find it hard to find goggles that fit these probably aren‚Äôt for you‚Äîcontrary to that being the advertised point of them."
1.0,Color is just like the picture but it didn't fall on me like it does on the model. Had to return
1.0,"I did not like this at all, sent it back. The material was extremely cheap and felt like it would rip like paper.."
1.0,Currently own 2 pairs of the boot cut and love them! These pants are not 1/2 as good. Fabric is thinner.  The cigarette legs fit real funky skinny in hip and bottom but the bottom leg portion is flared!  I feel like it looks like I put on a pair of really short bell bottoms.  Just poor fit and poor quality.
1.0,I ordered a large and the tag on the shirt said large but it was way too big for me but the shirt look really nice just too big
1.0,"The color, material, and print of this suit is great.. but the sizing is not so much. I ordered according to the size chart and the top is still WAY too small. Very disappointing"
1.0,Broke almost immediately after being worn once.
1.0,Returned it...too small.
1.0,"Extremely small! I ordered a size larger as recommended, but I should have ordered 3 or 4 sizes larger if I wanted a loose fit...There is no way this product should be advertised as a &#34;Loose Fit!&#34; .....Okay, I'm not a small girl, but I'm not a large one either. I'm 5 ft. 6 in. and 138 pounds. There is no way I'm going to order an XXXXLLLL!......I'm working on returning the product now."
1.0,Unflattering  for my body type- thicker 5'5
1.0,When I got this item it was the short version.  Not what was shown in the picture.
1.0,This watch was very nice to look at. But the time crapped out after two weeks.it has the same japanese movement as the other cheap<br />wood watch that i purchased from a different  seller. I got a refund from the other seller.  The band broke on this one and i threew it in the garbage.<br />My son bought a wood watch made by  Tense. He has not had any problems with it  but he spent around $100 for it. I will buy a Tense watch deplite the fact that it has the same Japanese Miyota movement as the cheaper models.  But it is safer to buy from a reputable companythat hopefully stands behind their product
1.0,silver color came off within a week of buying. Not worth the time to return product. In my opinion stay away
1.0,"I loved the way it looked and was very excited to wear it, but it broke in less than an hour! I fixed it, put it back on and it broke again from a different spot. I haven‚Äôt put it back on since."
1.0,Looked and fit great until the day before Oktoberfest- zipper broke and I had to sew myself in the day of. Then the clasps in the front fell off and it looked wonky.<br />Will be able to wear again after replacing zipper and reinforcing the clasps in front.<br />Received lots of compliments though and so pretty compared to all of the other more ‚Äòbasic‚Äô dirndls.
1.0,Most uncomfortable bra ever wore gets in the front and very hard to see the hooks
1.0,"Very poorly made!  Pocket seam came apart on the first wearing. It looks to me like it wasn't sewn at all.<br />And, where it was sewn the stitching scratches you.<br />Almost like it was melted."
1.0,The material was thin.  Cheap look.
1.0,Not water proof and the soles on both feet came unnattached and gave my husband trench foot.  awful awful awful waste of money.
1.0,Returned them. Way too big on me. I didn‚Äôt like the way they looked either
1.0,Great at first but broke after a couple weeks of wearing.
1.0,Too small I ordered a bigger size still too small
1.0,Too tiny. This is a scam
1.0,"I needed this for a Halloween party, it said it was to be delivered within 2 days. It showed up a day late. My fiance ended up making me a dress that looked 100x better than this one. So, still made it to the Halloween party save looked fabulous."
1.0,Not true to size fits like a size 2
1.0,If you could find a way to hold the dress in place so your bra wasn‚Äôt exposed that would be great. And it‚Äôs see through. So just beware.
1.0,Nothing like product description
1.0,Overpriced for this item
1.0,Dresses and swimsuits are too small for Barbie
1.0,Something went wrong with the knitting at the heel--very tight there.
1.0,"Quality is bad quality. From last 2-3 years, i have bought many items on the US Polo website and product quality is very nice. But this time when i bought few items on Amazon, i realized most of them are of bad quality. Not sure why, as merchant is US Polo."
1.0,Color is not true to photos.  Runs a bit small.  Very cheaply made.  Definitely a one-time wear costume.
1.0,This is not sweatshirt material as described. It‚Äôs thin and cheap feeling.
1.0,Really hurts the ear. Too much squeezing on earlobe.
1.0,Alittle disappointed but you do get what you pay for however perhaps the images should be a little closer to what they are actually selling
1.0,"These weren‚Äôt as long as shown and they‚Äôre not thick. They are pantry house material, to me. I have thick legs and my calf‚Äôs are big and these didn‚Äôt work for me. They kept rolling down."
1.0,Received the item today. Didn't want the wrinkles so I tried to iron it. Cotton and Silk irons fine. This did not probably because its not cotton and silk. Did not have a label of what the material was either and an ugly seam in the middle. BAD BAD BAD product description. Total BS. Sending it back ASAP!
1.0,This seems to be the suggested replacement bracelet for a Pokemon Go Plus but I cannot seem to figure out the configuration the rest of y'all must be using.
1.0,Can‚Äôt wear for a wedding because it would look like I‚Äôm going to the club. Returning. Wish they had bigger sizes. Or I‚Äôm a little too thick. Little bodies/bootys: all you girl crush it.
1.0,Ball on the one with the origami crane keeps snaggin as you try to screw and unscrew it. Took ten plus minute to unscrew the one with the crane too. Big disappointment<br /><br />So the one with the purple opals is a piece of junk too. In less than a week both opals feel out. Do not buy this
1.0,"I bought this to wear for my birthday, but (fortunately) it arrived much later than expected and I didn't get to wear it. I'm athletic, curvy, and don't have much of a belly, yet I look pregnant wearing it. The fit is incredibly weird. Unfortunately I missed the return window and am stuck with a dress that makes me look pregnant."
1.0,Se bajan mucho y es inc√≥modo estar manipulandola
1.0,"Gosh, I seriously hate writing bad reviews but this dress is soo cheap looking! It is equivalent to buying a halloween witch costume where the material and design is cheap. There is no area that hugs the body. The boob area is just black fabric with sheer tulle fabric. It will not support anything because like I said, it's just cheap fabric sewn together. I have a decent body, 5'2 and 100 lbs with a boob job (a full B) and I look like crap in this dress. Not that I expect to  be bangin' in every dress, it's just surprising how cheap and flat this dress is. The other girls who rated this high is tripping, I can't imaging anyone who has bought a dress at an American store, even at a flea market would find this any special. This dress is equivalent to a cheap 13 year old's dress at JC Penney's. The only person I can think of that may make this dress work is Coco, Ice-T's wife because she is just big boobs, big butt, small waist and with that body, you can distract anyone from looking at just your dress. I'm going to pack this ugly baby and send it back. Note to seller: sorry for the mean review, but please find another dress to sell!"
1.0,Sucks the flag wore off in two days
1.0,after only a week the linings tore out and feet hurt worse than if he‚Äôd worn nothing. Worth extra money for better ü§ò
1.0,"I tried to wash this odor away with windex which took the finish off but left the very poisonous smell.  I would return but I ruined the finish trying to get rid of the odor, so I will just throw the wallet away.  I would not recommend product."
1.0,It was a mess
1.0,"Very Cheap, it couldn't make through the first night."
1.0,necklace were broken when i recieved it
1.0,Didn‚Äôt expect much from $12 glasses but these broke in about 2 days flat.
1.0,Poor quality material. Short in length. Too small. Not true to size.
1.0,I ordered these for my teenage sons.  They would probably fit a 3rd grade boy.
1.0,"I washed and dried these in my washing machine and clothes dryer before wearing them, as I would any new under wearing product.  They shrunk so much they are unwearable for me.  There are no English instructions, only Chinese.  Don't buy them."
1.0,Doesn't hang past my bellybutton.  Not good.
1.0,"Expected long sleeves on the robe ,since that is what it appears to be in the picture and only 3/4 sleeves.."
1.0,"Ive ordered several of these heavy cotton shirts from Kola and they fit perfectly but this shirt from Trader Joe's is two small and I don't understand the reason why , maybe someone can enlighten me?"
1.0,These are crap. They're too small to be comfortable. I bought these to do crime watch in our neighborhood.<br />They hurt my head and make me dizzy. They're fine if you're right on top of something so what's the point ?
1.0,Very narrow in the thigh area and gappy in the waist. I had to return them. They don't seem to understand that women have hips and thighs.
1.0,Could not get it on so I gave it to my 14 year old niece.
1.0,Chinese size 2xl fits like a medium
1.0,This did not come in the expected size and the top looks nothing like the picture. My daughter was extremely disappointed and I was disappointed in the quality.
1.0,The product desription and picture was misleading!VERY DISAPPOINTED!I thouht they were SLIPPERS not SANDELS.I had Toe surgery I thouht I was getting something more comfortable.Hopefully the next customer isnt fooled like me!
1.0,Items were nothing like the picture. I should have listened to the bad reviews
1.0,I am not sensitive to any metals that I know of. My piercings are well over 20 years old. But over the past few months all of them have gotten infected for no reason. These are going to the trash. Please learn from my mistake and find something of higher quality.
1.0,"Laced up with pockets what a lie. Does not have any of those, fabric feels cheap, not bad of an emergency dress but I wanted more. I got the grape color, in the picture it looks like dark purple with an ashy look. This dress was straight up bright purple. I had to return it ASAP. About sizing It fit well until it got to my chest area. Too small to zip up. It has padded bra but doesn‚Äôt give a Flattering look"
1.0,The waist band rolled up like a window shade.  Not enough room in the male area. I was looking for a replacement for Joe Boxer brand underwear which are no longer available. These ain't them!
1.0,"They run very wide. My 3.5 year old is a 7/8 and we went with the 8. The length was a little small, and the width was too wide. She has thin feet but that‚Äôs never been an issue with regular shoes. These are overpriced for the quality but we needed them for a wedding. The backs of the shoes started rubbing and hurting her. We‚Äôve never had this problem with any other shoe. Would not recommend these. Weird sizing."
1.0,"Beautiful looking watch, but was losing 20 minutes per hour. Returned for refund."
1.0,Loved color but arrived already cracked not very rugged. Cheaply made.
1.0,I received with white deodorant marks.
1.0,"Keychain??!  These are incredibly fragile thin glass.  One broke even before arriving, despite amazon packing it in a padded mailer. The 24 glass items are just loose inside a tiny bag inside, so of course some will shatter"
1.0,They were pretty but too big for what I needed
1.0,The charm fell off with in 2 days of wearing this.
1.0,Too large and I‚Äôm small
1.0,"Fabric was super cheap, looked like a night gown made of acetate. The straps were too long and it was not appropriate to wear out without looking like you got out of bed. Wasn't even sure it could be ironed because it looked like it would melt. Return!"
1.0,Terrible fit !  I bought a size larger as instructed and way to big but they won‚Äôt let me return or exchange for smaller size. Very disappointed
1.0,"I had to return, these were child sized."
1.0,Product says fits shoe size 5-9 but when product arrived it clearly says shoe size 4-7. This is my second attempt at trying to buy the right size.
1.0,"I ended up not giving this gift because it not only looks cheap but it doesn't really look like anything. If I didn't know already, I'd never guess it was a cap and degree scroll. I would have been embarrassed to give this gift."
1.0,Have had 2 hats. First pop up braid stopped working. Second due to child pressing it repeatedly needed to sew together to mend. Both sides. Not worth money!!! If you make a hat for a child needs to be more sturdy.
1.0,The material is clingy. It‚Äôs a hassle to return even if you have prime. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt order it unless you know you‚Äôre going to like it.
1.0,Did not come with a belt like in the picture?
1.0,Changed colors and now looks like dark rust.
1.0,BUT ARE NOT VERY NARROW
1.0,This shirt was not cut or fit like the picture or description. I wanted to love it but unfortunately it had to go back!
1.0,"Way too small, Fits very very tiny people"
1.0,Might fit your 12 year old daughter!
1.0,It‚Äôs a spandex rough material! Awkward fit
1.0,Trust me...please trust me.  These are the worst pair of glasses I have ever seen or purchased.  I understand I didn't pay much for them...but WOW.  It is a cheaply made plastic/metal construction that will break with a single drop.  I at least expected to have a poorly made glasses that looked decent but I didn't even get that.  These things are so cheap that anybody who sees them will know you either got them out of a candy machine or are wearing them as a joke.  Don't waste your money!
1.0,These ear rings are so small they don't fit me! Was going to give them to someone I know  with a small child but they broke as I tried to put them on the child. The back is so poorly put together it doesn't fit securely when you try to close it. Very cheap almost like jewelry for a doll. So glad I didn't pay more than I did.
1.0,Much smaller than expected I am disappointed
1.0,"Picture is for body description (if yours is similar to mine, read my review) i ordered an XL and it wouldn‚Äôt even go over my arm (same as the large) but it fit my sister (who is a size small-xs) and i‚Äôm a size L in tops and XL in bottoms. so you need to size up as much as possible for it to fit. [im 5‚Äô3, 218lbs, Mostly muscle, bottom heavy (big b00ty and thighs) and 38 D]"
1.0,Do not waste your money this watch ‚åö is NOT waterproof not even water resistant & NOT advocated by ANY Navy seal!  Luminnox dares to state that it has a screw down crown üëë  IT DOES NOT üò° as a result it is NOT water proof not even water üåä  resistant! UNSAT for water all it does is glow sp you can see when you have run out of airüëÄ  Please üôèsave your money & buy a watch with a screw down crown üëë  not a Navy seal watch ‚åö
1.0,"Although there are some minor flaws, I still like it very much. It has a beautiful appearance and a very transparent mechanical movement. It takes time to test the accuracy of the time. In addition, I also sent a small bracelet (maybe leather). If you ask me, I recommend it. Buy it? All by my own feeling! still feel a bit rough in the production process, which does not match the price! The goods have been returned!It took more than two months to receive a refund, very disappointed!"
1.0,The product was very poorly! Runs very small!
1.0,Not at all like pic. No push up . On an A cup the bottom of breast hangs out.. Not happy at all
1.0,The item arrived and did not work. Amazon good to get information to me to return.
1.0,"The width of the bracelet is 2mm, not 4mm. And the garnets are very tiny and more of a golden brown color. This is definitely going back."
1.0,This literally broke the third time I was wearing it.  Super disappointed.
1.0,"There is nothing to be said that hasn't already been said, but just to reiterate, I ordered the adorable sweater based on the photo alone and received a bobo sweater that looked like a joke. It looks like something you buy a coworker that you don't like, just to see their reaction."
1.0,"Very small  it said 7 inches  was 6 inches,And was late in delivery. Returned it.."
1.0,The charging crystal arrived cracked in half. I asked for a replacement but got no redponse
1.0,It was not colored it showed
1.0,This dress is so very ITCHY. it is lovely and fits true to size but why is it so uncomfortable? I did not think that they made itchy clothes any more. The long sleeves are unbearable even after washing.
1.0,Rims bent and do not fit right.  Amazon will not allow return on this product
1.0,Do not buy these! They are listed as Sterling Silver but have nickel in them! Huge waste of money when you have an allergy!
1.0,They didn't fit and I'm not getting any help on returning them for my money back.
1.0,Fell apart with first washing. Don't buy
1.0,"My daughter is 10 years old, bought these for school uniform.  These shoes did not make it past the 3 month mark!!!  the sole started becoming unattached from the shoe, as shown in pictures by other customers.  Now I see why we buy the expensive classic kid shoe brand that this model is copied from!  They may cost over double but they usually last the entire school season!  This shoe not worth the savings as they don't last."
1.0,They do not stick. These fall off every time with in minutes.
1.0,Poor quality broke first day
1.0,Not worth it the hassle to return and reorder such a headache.
1.0,Messed up my order twice. Not a good brand to buy from
1.0,Order adult small. Came in for a xsmall child and shrinks when washed. Very disappointed
1.0,Purchase 2 sizes up. Material is very thin
1.0,"First and foremost, pearl bracelet is kinda hit and miss. Sometimes you do get it, sometimes you don't. In this instance, I didn't. The cuffs themselves are very cheaply made and practically made of plastic. Very same build and quality you would get at the Dollar Store. Just slip a fluffy sock around the cuff and bingo that's what you got. My suggestion: Don't buy them."
1.0,Seem to be too big in thighs and butt area. Feels weird. Ordered smaller size after taking tags off first pair.
1.0,Super disappointed in how cheap this is made and looks. I should have read the reviews before buying. I expected more at the price point. The worst part is I got it as a gift and now I‚Äôm scrambling at the last minute for something nicer. Very bummed.
1.0,"Bought for my son to play with. Although he loved the gift, the stones fell out within the hour. Had to reinforce with super glue. Eventually it turned my son's finger green. Nice idea but poor quality product."
1.0,"Whatever is on these made me,my mom, my wife all break out with a reaction that looked like and felt similar to poison ivy/oak  NOT WORTH IT"
1.0,"The bra is useless, it doesn't stay up. It literally folded down below my chest. In order to return it you have to pay for shipping back to China. Don't waste your money on this bra."
1.0,They are sooooooooo hard to screw in
1.0,Cheap product I sent it back for a refund
1.0,I ordered the 4x size (smaller than I usually wear) but it was plenty long but way too small. I considered returning it but the cost to return it was 10 times what I paid (including shipping). So I'm stuck with  it.  It also was very thin and had a strong smell. Very cheaply made. Don't waste your money. Too bad Amazon will not accept returns from third party companies and return in bulk as they could do much cheaper and keep the goodwill of their customers.
1.0,"Like another reviewer, I received the wrong pattern. It is a very bland pattern with little blue flowers all over. I had really hoped that it was an isolated mistake but apparently not. Do not order these if you are doing so because you want the pattern and color advertised. I will be returning them today."
1.0,ti looks like  rope but is cheap plastic hate it gonna see if i can cancel the others one i have comming
1.0,Disappointed with the fabric. I guess you get what you pay for. #cheap
1.0,Very cheap and poor necklace. The area near the claps is all black and ugly.
1.0,Fell apart at 2 washings.
1.0,One of them broke when trying to put it on. We didn't know they were going to break right away so we didn't keep the packaging. I am going to try to return them.
1.0,"This is a cute pair of boots, but they are very cheaply made. If you need a pair of cheap boots on the fly, make sure you have thick socks. Inside at the bottom where the ankle separates from the leg part, it‚Äôs almost like a cardboard piece that‚Äôs sewn in is sticking out into her feet."
1.0,"The pendant is small and the stone looks ok, yes just ok. The wire is what made me return this item. The wire is very cheap and wasn't closed properly leaving the end exposed which can cut the skin. The stone doesn't look real (that's my opinion)"
1.0,Came with just box no any papers or card even was like bad stuff uncovered with nylon  !!
1.0,Sent this back immediately. NOT suitable for high impact. There was little to no support and would be  better for yoga or Pilates. Too bad because i loved the colors and fun design
1.0,Ordered a 0g and got something way too small. :( Upsetting bc really wanted to wear it this weekend.
1.0,"Hey, I'm an average woman, and not large but not small.  At 149 pounds you would think these socks would have no problem going over my calves!  Holy cow, these things are for Twiggy.  One thing for sure is if you get them past your calves, you'll need a seam ripper to get them off.  Got taken on these.  I have no idea if they are warm or not!"
1.0,"The white ones of these are especially see through, and there is no bra as advertised; no foam padding at all. Sending them back."
1.0,Wayyyyyy smaller than described
1.0,Awful quality!
1.0,These are flimsy. I used 2 of them to clip my hat to my carry-on bag. They both fell off at some point.
1.0,The cut/style on the actual dress is nothing like I expected. Do not buy
1.0,It's sheer and not as pictured.
1.0,poor quality and way too small!!  I contacted seller to return and it would cost more than the purchase price to return.<br />Save your money and don't purchase!!
1.0,"These are so ridiculously small. Nowhere near the size they say. Nothing else really matters since nobody can wear shoes that are too small. Apart from that they are impossible to contact! I have been calling for a week and leaving messages with my number on the customer service line, which is NEVER open. Never a return call. They need to fix their sizing! Now they expect me to pay for the return shipping? Not fair."
1.0,This is not a bra.. Looks like a remnant of lace üôÑ
1.0,"I returned them because the strap end sticks out, ie,  Your watch is not secure on your wrist and can easily be pulled off"
1.0,This does not keep you warm. Just make your toes feel cozy. I live in Chicago and OMG those do not help!
1.0,Terrible quality! Links are so damage ...
1.0,"The quality is very poor, and the dress was extremely large. I am usually a medium, and it felt like I was wearing an XL. To get a better picture of this dress it looked like this was something you would wear to the beach."
1.0,Needed a basic digital waterproof watch for the gym. Read the reviews and like the price and tactical look of this...unfortunately it arrived with a dead battery. Contacted the shipper and they said to send back. They didn‚Äôt offer to send another one or could they detail how long the battery should last. I found another watch which has more features for a few dollars more which better suits my needs.
1.0,Product looks like it showed in the picture only bad thing was the product arrived broken.
1.0,Only had them 2 days. First time putting them on to wear the post fell off one of the earrings. You Don't pay $55.00 for earrings & this happens.
1.0,To small  size  for  me  but  like  colors  and  designed . ....‚ò∫
1.0,What a piece of junk.  I wore it 1 time  and fell off my wrist and lost it. It has the worst way of closing. Money down the drain.
1.0,"I loved the look of these gloves! They are very well made! I bought 2 pairs from different companies. Shallek and winna. Shallek gloves looked nothing like the winna gloves. Winna looks sleek and conforming to your hand but (and here is the but) winna's gloves were a dud right out of the box. I charged the batteries over night and then turned them on. Only one glove worked and the other glove didn't work at all and the lights were glitching. The glove that did work barely gave any heat. It was a Luke warm. I compared them to the Shallek gloves (you know the ugly non form fitting gloves) and the Shallek gloves worked amazing. Super hot and... Just look at my Shallek review. This is my winna review. I wanted these winna gloves to work so much because the gloves are so well made, comfortable and form fitting and cool looking. But the electronics failed out of the box. If they ever fix the problem I'll buy them because I love the gloves. I'm just stuck with these ugly gloves (Shallek) with a better battery and super hot technology and actually work.<br />Sent the item back and got a refund."
1.0,"arrived, pulled the battery protector out and the lights barely flash."
1.0,"I was very disappointed, these earrings were very cheap. They felt like sterling silver painted over plastic. I think I paid like $20 or so for them and I thought I'd get a decent pair of earrings, I threw them in the trash. Really disappointing."
1.0,This is a total rip off
1.0,I ordered this in XXXL (24-26) and it fits my daughter who is a 16...WAY TOO SMALL
1.0,Push button doesn‚Äôt say fastened to the pin
1.0,Awful! Cheap material and looks nothing like the picture when you put it on. I now have a new sleep shirt.
1.0,These did not hold up as depicted in photo. My third grade daughter was quite disappointed to see them ruined within a week of wearing them. I did not contact the seller to ascertain a refund so no information on that quality. I doubt I'll order an off-brand through Amazon again.
1.0,Zipper was broken when it arrived. Didn't want the hassle of trying to return so just stuck it in the closet
1.0,I'm 5'9 and ordered a 2xl. It was too small and not very comfortable.
1.0,It was really small.
1.0,One of my necklaces came broken.. very disappointed
1.0,3 holes total have been ripped into 2 of my leggings. Super thin and the high waist doesn‚Äôt keep it all sucked in. Will not buy again and do not recommend.
1.0,"I wish I could be like the other reviewers who actually received the watch. When my order arrived, I received a men's black watch, and promptly returned it. Thinking it was just a snafu, I reordered. Imagine my dismay today when again, I received a men's black watch! I must have by Tuesday, so I have had to go shopping in town today for a similar watch."
1.0,"Sizing is very small! I ordered a large and it did not even come close to fitting. (5'9, 130 lbs)"
1.0,"Don't buy this product, cheap material!"
1.0,Is smaller
1.0,Very cheap.  Came with &#34;jewels&#34; falling off.  Delivery was about 3 weeks.
1.0,The zipper is defective on this item.  When you zip it up the zipper just comes right back down when you move.
1.0,ordered pink lens received blue enough said !!!!!
1.0,"Dress description says cotton.  It is not cotton, what it is is some kind of synthetic fabric that feels like what swim wear is made of.<br />Not happy."
1.0,Very small. Only B cup sizes.
1.0,"This shirt did not even come with a tag. I know I did not order a small, but it is definately not a large"
1.0,Runs very small and was disappointed to find the material very flimsy although it says linen . Poorly made am giving it to charity.
1.0,Horrible. Started turning my finger green immediately.
1.0,I was very dissatisfied with this purchase. Was not near the quality as the one I had before. The band inside the hat was very uncomfortable. It is being sent back
1.0,Not as vivid abs can not read inscription
1.0,"Ordered them for photos next week, they arrived dented (like creases) up. Also they are very thin and the heel/ankle part is very rough and will give blisters and pain so plan ahead order a size up and wear very thick socks.<br /><br />Too inconvenient to send back so throwing them away."
1.0,It doesn't fit nice.... between the legs is like nothing is holding your staff...
1.0,"Definetly sag a lot in the crotch. Thick, but you can see sweat spots in them when working out"
1.0,At first glance it‚Äôs cute! At second glance the button area has a rip! At third glance the skirt is too small! Tragic!!!!!
1.0,"TERRIBLE PRODUCT! POOR QUALITY!<br />THIS IS A VERY LOW QUALITY PRODUCT.  FOR ONE THING, AFTER WASHING AND IRONING, THESE HEADBANDS ARE 3 1/2&#34; SMALLER ON ONE SIDE AND 3/4&#34; SMALLER ON THE OTHER SIDE THAN STANDARD MADE IN USA HEADBANDS.<br />I have been wearing and using headbands since the 60's so I have a lot of experience with this item.  These are horrible quality.  Worst I've ever seen.  Even after only 3 washing, the edges have begun to fray.  They also come loaded with sizing, stiff, and unwearable.<br />And because the size is smaller, it is very hard to tie a knot."
1.0,The lace was see through and itchy. It appeared this portion was lined in the picture.
1.0,Not for skinny feet.  Cute sandal‚Ä¶the band is way to big.  I wanted to love it
1.0,Lense pops out rendering the glasses useless!
1.0,"Get what you pay for. Comes in a ball, have to stretch it and it still doesn't fit. Kind of looks like steel wool. Not impressed"
1.0,Lost tracker first day using this band.  Looks sturdy but definitely now worth it.
1.0,"TOO SMALL, TOO TIGHT, TOO UNCOMFORTABLE.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1.0,"This was a weird shirt. Weird cut. Arm circumference was tiny. Not sure if it was made for a human being or not. Donated it. Took a log time to get here. Was sent from overseas. Cute fabric/print, though.  =("
1.0,"Product arrived brand new in the box, but the right lense had a large scratch in it. I had to return the glasses and re-order them."
1.0,Can‚Äôt wear it. So dang small
1.0,"Don‚Äôt stay up on your ears at all, slips down and looks like a pair of fuzzy headphones. Just buy a head band from Walmart for 3 dollars if you want to keep your ears warm."
1.0,"These masks feel like they are made of burlap or recycled vegetable sacks, not cotton. They are so rough and hard they have a hard fold that is almost like paper or cardboard. I really regret this purchase!"
1.0,It came broken too cheap
1.0,Wasn't true to size too small. Returned
1.0,Do NOT buy from AtoretTOR!!! The quality is no where near the same as Joteisy dresses. I bought this dress in white and LOVED it the quality was five stars so I  ordered it in another color and didn‚Äôt check the seller. Let me tell you do not order from anyone but Joteisy! It‚Äôs no where near the same dress. The fabric is itchy and there‚Äôs no lining. They also won‚Äôt allow you to return it and haggled with me for days to just take 20% as a refund. Amazon really needs to get better about allowing sellers to piggy back on other brands products because this is not as it‚Äôs described on Amazon.
1.0,"Runs VERY small, after a single wash I could no longer wear. There‚Äôs a reason why you shouldn‚Äôt by clothes online."
1.0,"I don't drive much at night but when I do, these glasses do absolutely nothing different.  They don't help with the glare of headlights at all.  My first clue was the card that came with the glasses.  You're suppose to see something different on the card when you put them on but that didn't happen.  I should have sent them back but like I said, I don't drive at night much so it took awhile before I figured out that they do't do what it says they will do."
1.0,"I liked the style, and the design.  Not the fabric, so I returned it.  Hope they got the credit to my Amazon account.<br /><br />Enid Benda"
1.0,These looked like a plastic garbage bag!! Sent them back
1.0,"Very light, if any, compression and very poor quality. There is also no way of telling what side it the front and back. I havent even worn them for more than an hour and the crotch seams have holes."
1.0,"Cheap for a reason, material started deteriorating during the first week of usage."
1.0,It didn‚Äôt work straight from the package. My son was so disappointed.
1.0,"I‚Äôm ticked. I literally bought this because of the cute saying on the packing. Very misleading and I‚Äôm very upset. This was supposed to be for my best friend, but now I can‚Äôt give it to her bc it looks like it came straight from the factory and was $1. Do not buy this product"
1.0,"The briefs come in a variety of colors.  Despite washing them in cold water, the colors bleed very badly.  Tossing them to the garbage can."
1.0,Two stones fell out within 24 hours of receipt.  I would return it but it isn't worth the bother.  Do not purchase!
1.0,This item isn't as pictured and seller will not provide full refund Beware!
1.0,It broke on the first day I had it. It went in and out of my purse twice and broke.
1.0,You will not get these on or off unless you have very small hand. They should be advertised that way!
1.0,I am 5‚Äô3 there is no reason why this dress should have fallen just under my reason ... so disappointing
1.0,Sizing was off. Bought a size bigger than i needed and shirt was still too small
1.0,sleezy material
1.0,"Cheaply made, falling apart as soon as they were taken out of the package"
1.0,This hat is small and looks way more cheap then the picture.
1.0,Definitely not chubby friendly. I ordered the 5x (I'm a 2x) and I couldn't even get it over my boobs. Complete waste of money
1.0,Doesn't feel like the product I have some to except from copper fit.  2 pair rip and tore apart. The Material is not the same as I am used to with Cooperfit.  Feels like a cheap knockoff.
1.0,"Horrible fit, obviously not Authentic Nike! SCAM!"
1.0,Pretty but it broke off the chain when I picked it up and the so called amethyst crystal had a hole drilled threw it because it was a bead not a crystal and it looks like it isn‚Äôt even real amethyst it looks like plastic.
1.0,"I usually wear a medium in hoodies, but I read the reviews and ordered a large.  I couldn't even zipper this version.  It was good looking but so tiny.  Thank you, Amazon Prime.  It was returned - no hassels.  Thank you, Amazon.  LLAP"
1.0,"Honestly, these earrings are so incredibly small that I could hardly believe I had paid money for them.  I have never been so disappointed in anything I have ordered via Amazon as I was with this purchase.  Don't do it!"
1.0,The color was nothing like I expected and the hat looked horrible in person.
1.0,"It reduced the musty odor from a pair of shoes that has that persistent odor issue.  But even after several 60 minute treatments using this product, the smell persists."
1.0,It broke the first time I tried to change out for another one.  Seller was very good at taking it back.
1.0,Paper thin. One time wear.
1.0,So disappointed. I tried on the leggings and they had a hole in the crotch. Not worth the money.
1.0,"The color blue was everywhere. Stained my skin, my fingernails and any clothes that I wore after it.  So disappointed"
1.0,Pockets r awful. They stick out and make it look wierd. U can really tuck them in. Attracts lint like no tomorrow.
1.0,To be honest I never tried this on. The material is like a see through thin shower curtain. It was awful. I thought about returning but didn't have time before my time period expired.
1.0,There is not any foam around the chin or nose on these masks.  It sits flat against your face and does not provide much room for moving your mouth to talk.
1.0,It has a great fit and is very comfortable. But I wore it for less than a couple of hours and it already had a small hole in the crotch along the seam. Hoping it doesn't continue to rip and get bigger. Very disappointed with the quality!!!
1.0,"The material is not polyester and spandex as descibed, and not soft. This is deceitful. It is the same as hard bedding sheet. One can make this at a local tailor. The pictures are CGI. Super disappointed. Not going to take anything by seriously on amazon.com"
1.0,"It fit ok and the colors were beautiful,  but the colors would NOT stop bleeding. After a dozen washes and trying to drain the color by hand i gave up and asked for help. To which I was told &#34;My supervisor's daughter has many and they all bleed like that.&#34; Be careful when buying."
1.0,"I ordered this thinking the background was going to be a shade of white, opalescent like. It looked like that to me in the photo. When I received it, it was transparent and clear. Because of that, the colors on the hearts did not appear as vivid. Also, the shape of some of the hearts were not well defined as shown on the photo with a pointy tip. Some of them just looked like circles with a little indentation on the top.  I was disappointed. Also, the packaging it came in did not state it was 925 Sterling."
1.0,So terribly cheap looking! Badly made!  The sad part is usually I get quality cases for the same price!  Not this time!  Save your money my friends!
1.0,"I bought these for my mom to keep her calves from swelling up to bad,  well let's just say these socks are so tight I had a hard time even opening the opening to stretch them to get on<br /><br />I wouldn't get these again"
1.0,Smells horrible.  Terrible quality.  I threw it in the garbage.  I would never recommend to anyone.
1.0,Pins kept falling out for no reason.  Returned it.
1.0,The strap is impossible to close with one hand...takes 2 people to put it on...would not recommend
1.0,Wanted to use for golf or walking but the zipper was awful - did not move easily and pulled the fabric
1.0,"returned really not a good quality at all, cannot use., very dissappointed"
1.0,Bought this from another company but it's still the same picture. The one I received was not as wide as the one in the photo. Poor representation of the product. Very disappointed.
1.0,terrible fit.
1.0,This junk broke the first ten minutes I had it! Do not waste your money!!
1.0,Muy lindo el modelo lo estaba esperando con muchas ansias pero no result√≥ muy peque√±o actualize las tallas
1.0,"I love wearing glasses. I have at least 10 pairs, and I really enjoy matching my spectacles to my mood. Unfortunately, the pandemic has forced me to pop in my contacts everyday instead of throwing on my glasses. You see, as soon as you put on a mask while wearing glasses, your lenses become covered in fog and you‚Äôre completely unable to see.  That‚Äôs why I was so excited about this product, and, ultimately, so disappointed.<br /><br />When I opened the the package, I made sure to read the directions and follow them to a tee. I rinsed my lenses with water, dried them off, applied the anti-fog spray to both sides of each lens, and let it sit for 15-20 seconds before wiping them off. I was so sure it would work, I didn‚Äôt even do a test run. I just threw on my glasses, tossed a mask in my pocket, and headed out.<br /><br />I was optimistic. It‚Äôs pretty chilly where I‚Äôm at, and usually my glasses will fog up for a few seconds when I go from a warm environment to a cold one. That didn‚Äôt happen after using the spray, so I was feeling good about my decision to purchase this spray. When I got to where I was going, I threw on my mask before entering the building. Almost immediately, my glasses became completely covered in fog. There was absolutely no difference between the amount of fog that was covering my lens after the spray as there was before it.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre looking for something to stop your glasses from fogging up for that split second when you walk outside, then I suppose this will work just fine for you (although, in my humble opinion, $15 is a little steep to fix an inconvenience so small). But if you‚Äôre looking for a product that will stop your glasses from fogging up when you‚Äôre wearing a mask, this isn‚Äôt it. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
1.0,Inexpensive for sure. Small and tight fit. Might make it through a few days of wearing.
1.0,"I ordered the item and received the incorrect item twice. I returned both of them. I was looking forward to wearing this, but after seeing the quality of the incorrect harness, I don't think I am missing out."
1.0,The bows fell apart days after I got them. I wish I could get a refund for this because I wasn't able to use it but one day.
1.0,They are legitimately crap. Do NOT buy these. It's like someone cut up legging material. Not at all safe!!
1.0,"I purchased this for a part of an outfit for a Renfeast, the clasp broke somewhere throughout the day and I never noticed.  Moreover, all I was doing was walking around and not doing anything for it to break like that."
1.0,These won‚Äôt work well on adult ears. The heart or circles are too small and go right thru piercing
1.0,This hat is ridiculously floppy.  Just hangs down oddly.  Wouldn't recommend at all.
1.0,I ordered a medium but this top was extremely small. It could fit a child. Very thing and cheaply made.
1.0,After 6 months the watch hand broke / dis-assemble inside the case.  Needless to say the watch is useless.<br />A watch repair tech looked at the watch and communicated two points -- watch couldnt be repaired based on how it is design/manufacturered and it wasnt worth it.
1.0,waste of money it did not fit
1.0,These sunglasses lüëÄK good. The AD stated they were petite in size...I must of gotten the largest petite size on the planet. They are SO BIG (wide) they could fit the width of a cows face. They are too big even for the biggest man. They will be returned as soon as I get the printed label and into the mail.
1.0,I had hoped they corrected the mistake since other people reported it in their reviews.  Totally ruins it for Halloween and now it's too late to get something else to wear.  So disappointed. Will be returning this.
1.0,"Just walking the dog and its not raining, just the water on the pavement, the shoes really deformed, and whithin a few days the outsole of the shoes detached<br />Shoe its not leather, material becomes smelly"
1.0,Way too large for my  small wrist... Instructions on adjusting are only confusing pictures... A Chinese product
1.0,"This was a beautiful set of pearls, unfortunately it is not a good setting. I put these on the day I got<br />them went to the store and one was gone before I got home. I never felt it fall out which it shouldn‚Äôt have done. How do you ask for a refund, you can‚Äôt prove it."
1.0,"Disappointed. Print was very nice, but shirt was too small"
1.0,"Trust the negative reviews. DO NOT BUY. Thick felt blanket material, very odd structure, not flattering at at all!"
1.0,"I really wanted this to work, because I own a set of the type with the rubber button you push through the loop and pull tight and it is supposed to stay in place with a friction lock.  That pair slips off regularly so I wanted to try the clamp style and bought a set of these.<br /><br />Literally the first time I unsnapped and then snapped it together it came apart in my hands.  Four pieces that I can't get to fit back together and snap correctly.  Hopefully I just got a defective one but the quality control is disappointing.  Back to the old style I guess."
1.0,Very pretty but no bubble wrap? The stones got all smashed up! I‚Äôm so upset! I love much more I‚Äôve bought so many things from them but I guess not everything will come ok!
1.0,I bought two one for each of my girls one was fine but the pink was missing the top topper and the button on the handle was completely broken
1.0,Ordered 2 X and looked like small junior
1.0,Very light- medium cheap cotton if you don't have some little noticeable curves don't bother to purchase.
1.0,The picture looks like a thick cloth but it's really thin tee shirt  material. Do not like it at all. I keep it but it sucks
1.0,"One sandal was wider than the other,therefore one fits and one fits big"
1.0,It's so ugly that me you wont wear it long..doesn't wash up well either and colours a dull
1.0,This chain broke the first week that I received it. It is very poor quality! Do not buy this product.
1.0,Not the right model
1.0,The necklace is plastic and flimsy. Not real silver. Will be returning.
1.0,The brim is crooked and the product isn't of quality. I would save your pennies and get an alternative.
1.0,One of the earrings came broken. I was really looking forward to wearing these :(
1.0,It was not what I would have expected it was not easy to get the top on
1.0,This is stupid it‚Äôs kinda funny
1.0,Very weird and stretched out face. It does not look like the picture.
1.0,Product went ‚Äúmissing‚Äù in two shipping attempts.  Don‚Äôt waster your time.
1.0,Este art√≠culo nunca llego
1.0,Definitely not one size fits all. I gave it away.
1.0,Poor quality and too small  need to be returned.
1.0,Poor fabric quality .... Way too tight
1.0,Polyester blend with a weird fit. Said it was red sleeves and got an awful orange color instead. Not impressed at all. Only good thing was the price
1.0,"I had received this and just opened last week.  The SS chain was black, so safe to say no rhodium plating over SS. Also the loop on the clasp is too small and the clasp will not go in. I will need to review the return policy on this ."
1.0,"So irritated! Just bought these and have only worn them once,while putting them on the strapped ripped. I returned them and asked for my full refund."
1.0,"1. I ordered a small, and I am always a small. This was more like a Large.  2. The dress had several large dirt/glue stains on it... pretty disgusting if you ask me. Returning."
1.0,Wrong color that came in. It had no extra metal to hold the bands on. The strapes were really thin.
1.0,I wish I had noticed the punctuation errors before I ordered. My own fault.
1.0,Very short post can‚Äôt even screw the ball on one in
1.0,Ordered two sizes up and xxlarge for a woman it fit my 10 year old niece
1.0,"not super happy, the waist was way too tight but then the legs were crazy loose. I won't be wearing these."
1.0,It ripped with first wear...bad quality fabric...wouldn‚Äôt buy again from this seller!
1.0,The bracelet is very cute but it broke within one hour of my daughter putting it on.
1.0,"I bought the following Casio wrist watch (Casio F91W-1 Classic Resin Strap Digital Sport...) in early July, 2015, and about early January, 2016 parts of the numbers on the face started disappearing. Can't always tell what time it is without tilting the watch. I've owned about ten similar Casio watches over the years, and never had this happen before. I will never buy another watch at amazon."
1.0,"The heart rate monitor using the chest belt does not work.  Used it only a couple of times, and started getting totally inaccurate heart rates like 200-300 bpm.  Sent it back for warranty repair, and got another unit.  After couple of uses, this monitor had the same heart rate error issue.  I gave up on the item, otherwise I'll keep paying warranty shipping to get junk in return."
1.0,To small and didn't get full refund
1.0,"The Rush logo is messed up. The stitching goes through it so it says ""RSH"". Complete waste. The only reason I bought it was the logo, otherwise it's just a cheap mask."
1.0,Its actually in the back seat of my car somewhere. IT'S Garbage!!! Unless I lost the piece that makes it fit snug this product is a joke! Gotta buy another . I get so frustrated when I buy CRAP!
1.0,"I return the shirt . I didn't like it, look very different in person, the material seem strange and ugly . I wasn't happy with the look of the shirt."
1.0,Too small and too tight.  I ordered a pair of large like any other pair and they fill too tight.
1.0,I didn't find the cut flattering.
1.0,Shows scratches and turned my finger green after only 2 days
1.0,Very thin--shrinks when washed!
1.0,The shirt came to small
1.0,Large was too small and clean us to big
1.0,Cute & comfy.
1.0,Not 5 holders (10 sides) as advertised! ONLY 4 sleeves + the insert to hold it in the wallet.  You have to destroy the packet to see the problem. Plus there is a $1.50 retail sticker on it!  Found the perfect 5 sleeve unit at Walmart for less money.  Very deceptive advertising here. Not happy.
1.0,"Sstrap was loose from the purse, returned.  Sorry"
1.0,Seller is selling this as genuine leather. Worn about 15 times.... about two weeks worth... coming apart. UGLY. Not real leather.
1.0,The description clearly states the replacement band is NOT for the S2 3G R730 version however the packaging states the band is for the S2 3G R730 version?  What series of the Samsung Smart Watch are the band's actually manufactured for?
1.0,"Not ruffled on both sides, looks cheaply made."
1.0,"I ordered this exact top 2 years ago and I still have it.  I love the top so much i wanted to order a second one so I didn‚Äôt destroy it without having another one.  The one I just ordered arrived and it‚Äôs completely different cheaper material.  I will never order from this company again.  Super sad because the original is perfect.  In my photos the one on the top is 2 years old, the one on the bottom is the new one that made from cheaper materials..."
1.0,one word cheap
1.0,This was the perfect watch until the stones started to fall out and stopped working when I changed to day light savings time.
1.0,"Very cheaply made. It wasn't packaged in a jewelry box, it was loose in with other items."
1.0,This is not what I bought .... diferent color diferent  size.
1.0,Product was nice but too small for a mans head.
1.0,It‚Äôs SHEIN so it‚Äôs cheap
1.0,"instead of the dark brown/black like I ordered, I was sent charcoal/black. the quality of the purse was very cheap looking. I wouldn't wear this purse to the corner store.  that is how dissatisfied with this order."
1.0,Wasn&#34;t worth the money. Very flimsy
1.0,My money went directly to the trash can! On the 1st day I was wearing the wings and tail got broke! This is joke for the price I paid! Never ever will purchase again this product! DO NOT RECOMMENDED
1.0,Looks just like the photo. I liked it for the first week I had it in but woke up one morning and it started to turn my lip green. Made very cheaply. I have never had any body jewelry turn my skin green. Very disappointed.  Don't buy if you plan on wearing it for a extended period of time!!!
1.0,"Too bad these were so small I ordered XL and got what seems like a size M couldnt even get them up to my thighs, materal very thin and see through. Also Im 5'9&#34; and they are more for someone who is 5'4&#34;"
1.0,I am normally a L or XL and this product has no stretch and was made for perhaps a small or medium.
1.0,"Sorry to say, these glasses do not block blue light & they are not anti- glare.<br />Do not bother wasting your money."
1.0,"These pants absolutely suck. They feel terrible, the pockets are uncomfortable if you put anything in them. I tried wearing a duty belt with them and I was not able to. A complete waste of money. I'm giving them away."
1.0,"The size was about half what it should be, the material thin and flimsy. Useful for a dust cloth."
1.0,Too tight. Broke easy
1.0,If I could give it zero I would. Ordered a 14 k gold chain. Received a gold filled beaded chain with circles and blue beads. Sent it back yesterday
1.0,I had to send this back.  Two different colors of the blue were utilized and didn't match making it look very cheap.
1.0,So disappointed. The fit is at least 3 sizes too small. Cheap material.
1.0,I use similar style sports briefs from rebook and those i wear a medium.<br />On the other hand these fit way tighter than a medium than expected especially around the crotch which is unfortunate because they look nice and a tight crotch is uncomfortable.<br /><br />Another thing i noticed is the grey ones fit tighter than the other colors even the material feels different.
1.0,This came broken!! And the heart was way bigger then looked in picture
1.0,"ITHOUGHT THESE BRAS WOULD WORK FOR ME, BUT AFTER ONE WSEARING A SEAM SPLIT SINCE IT WASN'T SEWN PROEPRLY."
1.0,"I bought the green &#34;canvas&#34; like band.  I mention this because it appears that some of the bands available under this item are leather and probably would not be an issue as mine was.<br /><br />The band itself was ok, seemingly well made, but where the bands wrap around the metal clasps and are sewed/glued together is VERY rough and within a few minutes I was seriously itching.  The truth is your wrist is going to be a pretty sensitive area for just about anybody.  I wonder if anyone who made these even put them on for any length of time, they are literally unwearable."
1.0,This hat is big enough to fit my father.  My toddler daughter was so sad when this came and it did not fit her head.  No child has a head this big. Disappointing.
1.0,The costume ripped apart in the crotch area minutes after putting it on.  So we were able or order another one in time for trick or treat but after wearing it for about an hour it too ripped in the crotch area all the way up to the waist.  Would not recommend.  My granddaughter was embarrassed.
1.0,Size XL appears to be a medium.
1.0,COULD-NOT PUT SOCK ON MY FOOT SIZING NOT AS DESCRIBED - OR THE SOCK MADE IRREGULAR?
1.0,"Should have known the price would reflect the quality.  The screen print on the shirt is slightly crooked and off center, the shorts are thin and basically see-through, and the color of the socks don't match the shirt and shorts.<br />Update:  The company reached out to me and offered a refund.  That was an appreciated gesture but does not change the accurate review of the item itself."
1.0,"I cannot express my annoyance with these pants. I LOVE the look, and can't find something comparable, so I ordered until they got it right. I'm a size 6-8 in American jeans, and had to order a XXlarge. The green is ripped along the leg, and they sent me a 2XL, and one might assume the same, but they're labeled as such, and are drastically different sizes. The green is almost too baggy, but it works, and it's long enough. I am 5'10, but the other two colors, white and blue which I received in a XXL are capris. They come to mid-shin."
1.0,Cracked on both sides! ! Not impressed. ..
1.0,The colors are darker than in the picture. Also it runs small.
1.0,"These flip-flops and are very attractive, but after having them for only a month, the clips rubber coverings are already falling off. This is because the clip is extremely non-user friendly. It is next to impossible to pinch the clip open, and clip to one's glasses frames without smearing fingerprints all over the sunglasses. The clip is pretty low-profile and not too visible (unless up close) but the clip is too small for big hands to easily operate, smudge-free."
1.0,"I was very disappointed that this shirt isn't the vibrant colors as shown online. It is very dull in coloring! And I asked to return it, but realize now that they probably would only give me the small amount that they show is being charged because the shipping cost is the major part of the invoice. MY BAD! I should have known this would be a problem if I didn't like the product. I am in hopes that I will be able to maybe make an exchange for something else without having to pay the shipping to return it??? If so, I will REWRITE this review. Have to wait 2 days to get a reply from the seller per Amazon."
1.0,Are these socks made for small children?<br />Good luck getting even a couple of toes into the tiny holes....
1.0,Bought them for my husband; he said they did not help at all; had to return them.
1.0,Snapped immediately when taken out of package.
1.0,Extremely small around neck.
1.0,Looks nothing like the pic. The arms just look like they‚Äôre made too short
1.0,Cheaply made uncomfortable size was 5x smaller then expected and it itched even after washed
1.0,"Thin, runs large, chintzy feel, & no pockets. My bad for but realizing there are not pockets, by the description here before I ordered.<br />This is not worth the price"
1.0,don't make a different
1.0,Just got a set while at Sam's Club for a gift today and while checking the items out at home noticed the clasp was broken on one of the chains. The lifetime warranty states that you have to mail it in with a 5 dollar shipping fee. I got the silver ones and it sounds like tin when you lay it out on the table. First time seeing this the items he showed at Sam's looked of better quality but the ones I got doesn't seem that good. Would not give over the price of 65 dollars.  Time will tell on the ones the clasp not broke on.
1.0,Literally the worst item I've bought from amazon. I was swimming in the chest and the straps are sized for a 2 year old. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,This is the most bizarre piece of clothing I have ever purchased.<br />Do not buy this deceiving item.<br />It seems that the manufacturer ran out of material before they completed the item. It's a badly shaped shawl with wrist loops at the end.<br />You certainly cannot tell that this is the case by looking at the photo.<br />It is cheap and tacky and confusing to even wear.<br />This is getting returned.<br />DO NOT BUY
1.0,that it cheap quality was not fitting as it should wasted 45 bucks i had sent to friend  and it  i got it back late but i wanted to return but i didn't get it till march 4 i couldn't access the locker so huge wasted so if ur small don't get this cuz small is medium they have no small
1.0,First one came broken. Sent it back for a replacement. Wore the second one twice and it broke halfway through the nite. Oh well.
1.0,So disappointed! This dress feels so soft and I didn‚Äôt even get to wear it before it tore. Somehow it torn on the chest where there isn‚Äôt even a seam. Returning this immediately.
1.0,not worth 40.00 had broken button also small face Invicta is a few bucks more but way better
1.0,"Please don't buy it, its the worst material. It looks like it will dissolve with one wash."
1.0,They fit too small
1.0,Product of very poor quality. The dye bleeds to the other socks and the box they cane in.
1.0,My daughter has worn them a total of 5 times before the squeaker broke. Replaced the squeakers with the extra set they provide and they still don‚Äôt work. Must be a defect with the shoe itself. They‚Äôre still very cute as shoes that don‚Äôt squeak tho. But I wouldn‚Äôt buy them again.
1.0,"Returned this product immediately , coat size read 2X not true. Do not recommend"
1.0,The shorts are extremely thin and loose. They also came with multiple obvious loose threads. Super low quality.. I would recommend avoiding this product!
1.0,"Poor design, irregular fit, with loose threads."
1.0,"I got these for my birthday.  The second time I wore them, I looked in the mirror when I got home and the large star stone at the top of one of the earrings was missing.  Very disappointing."
1.0,"Like other reviewer said, the bezel does not rotate. The bracelet is shoddy, as if made of tin. There is no booklet, or instructions included. I am returning it."
1.0,"I thought this would be soft and great to lunge in, i was wrong, it's 'silky' in a bad way, clings to every curve and smells like chemicals."
1.0,"The groove is shallow and ineffective at actually holding a hairband. Since the end is curved outward instead of inward, and my wrists aren't perfectly flat on the bottom, the bangle actually ends up pushing the hairband off to the side, where it inevitably comes off if I move my arm even a little.<br /><br />I mean, it's still very pretty, but I didn't buy it just for it's looks. I wanted it for its usefulness... and it fails horribly in that area."
1.0,These were broken when I took them out of the box. Where the straps snap into the round button piece there should be 2 little plastic pongs that slide in but I only have 1 on each side and the broken piece was in the container in came in. Extremely disappointed. Not good quality
1.0,Didn‚Äôt keep its shape. Waist area to big. Says it‚Äôs slim fit. Not.
1.0,They stuck as advertised but they were filthy dirty right out of the box. You could not see through them or clean them. I returned the product. I would rate this a -10!
1.0,"I was so dissatisfied and disappointed. They are so short, you can barely see them when you put them in. The magnet is weak. It would be WAY better if it was longer with a better magnet. Great idea, poor execution."
1.0,My husband received this as a Father's Day gift.  He loved it but it cracked the very first time he put coffee in it.  Very disappointing.
1.0,After having worn these nearly every day for less than 2 months the left heal cushion has collapsed.<br /><br />Poor quality.
1.0,Size runs extra extra small. Sleeves do t even come to the wrist.
1.0,"NOW the ad clearly states for Asian fit. It did not before. Besides being 2-3 sizes too small, the fabric is see through thin. The elastic in the waist is not attached in any way so it will roll up inside the waistband. The design is tight in the hips and thighs. I am 5'7&quot; and they did not go waist high, nor did they go down to my ankles. I hope Amazon will force a more consistent size evaluation for their website, soon."
1.0,"The neck line in front is much too high while the one in back is too low. The front tends to make you choke, while the back droops much to low. It doesn't fit like it should and looks quite strange."
1.0,After you wear them for awhile (like 2 weeks) they start to rip and tear
1.0,They run small..
1.0,They are cheap for a reason look elsewhere. The material is super thin and they do not stay up I have to keep yanking them up.
1.0,This is not a true fictional search.  Two of the knobs are not real and this one came not working.  Buyer beware!  Nice on the pictures but very deceiving.  Do Not Buy! You 0
1.0,"Crown doesn‚Äôt adjust date, neither second time. It‚Äôs not waterproof"
1.0,Cheap thin.. Not for plus sizes
1.0,The top part around the arms curled up...poor quality
1.0,If you don‚Äôt have a super long beard it won‚Äôt work.
1.0,Not full kit. Had major pieces missing. Earrings broke too easily. Cheaply made.
1.0,"Really cute, but they came broken."
1.0,"I've bought some similar pants like this one, but this one is still waaaaay too big for me and it was an ""XS"" :/"
1.0,I  am most disappointed with my purchase. I ordered a size 8.5 and they sent me an 11. I was going to use this for an upcoming trip and now i have a giant shoe that can't fit anyone. üò§üò≠ its such a nice shoe but its going to waste.
1.0,"Poor quality, poor construction, poor product"
1.0,"This clutch is lovely, but very poorly made. The first time it was used, many pearls and rhinestones fell off making it impossible to ever use again.  We expected more for the price and are very disappointed.  Don't think I would buy from this company again for fear that all of their products are cheaply made."
1.0,Was not a racerback was just a boxy white tank.  Lettering was ok.  Was not what was pictured.
1.0,"Cheap quality, dont waste your money"
1.0,Fake pearl and not sterling silver
1.0,all 3 pairs broke after couple of time using them.the worth quality ever!!!!!!
1.0,"It says small but looks medium to my body, im small, petite small.. asian"
1.0,So this bra was uncomfortable and when I wore it made it seem like I had extra titties on the side and front lower breast area.. sent it back got my money back...
1.0,poor quality. it broke first time worn.
1.0,Cheap. Broke first time trying to put it on.
1.0,Waste of money it looks like the photo another customer put up it is really to big i order medium and it like a xtra large plus it have a stain on the sleeve which look very nasty. I was very disappointing because i was already deceived with the looks then d size and to top it off a stain to really stupes..dont waste your money guys and when i told dem they wanted to give me back 30% of my money smdh and end of giving me 50% i am never buying from them again.
1.0,"Super thin and looks awful. This is not something I would wear out. I purchased it to wear around the house, and I used a discount, because I was not going to pay $17 for it. They should not charge more than $8 for this. I am not disappointed because I expected it not to look like the picture and the quality to be subpar. If you are looking for something to wear around the house, then yes purchase this, but do not pay more than $8 dollars for it. It's as thin as a really cheap sweatshirt."
1.0,Did not work. Was uncomfortable to wear. Very disappointed.
1.0,it showed up broken
1.0,First of all the box was too big so when I received them the box was crushed as insufficient padding. Please use smaller box. The glasses survived and they looked really cool. But they don't work. I am 3.25 strength. Started from one end of dial and slowly moved the right. Nothing. Same for left nothing. My husband tried he is 1.75. Nothing. Totally blurry with no change. Did I get a dud pair? I had to pay $5 us to courier them from Miami as I live on a Caribbean island. I have now wasted $15us. I award no stars but won't let me send without choosing one.
1.0,"I was looking forward to get this dress in a rose color for a photoshop for my birthday, instead I got a very poor quality dress, it was smelly and definitely not a Rose color. I paid for a faster shipping for something that was not it. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this."
1.0,Unfortunately my belly button did not take kindly to these rings. They are made super cheaply which I expected for the price but it caused swelling and redness and I was unable to wear and use them. I have pretty sensitive skin but seeing as to how my belly piercing is more than 15 years old I was not expecting it to cause problems.
1.0,The shirt is the correct size and blend. The picture and description lead you to believe there are two shirts included in the price. Out of the blue and black in the picture I only received the black large shirt. The other seller is selling black for $8 I spent $11 thinking I was getting two shirts. Deceptive seller.
1.0,"Cheaply made and does not fit the description. The description says glitter sequins. There is no sequins. It looks more like a plastic material, just weird. In addition, it has missing and loose threads and a hole was forming in the sticking. It will be returned just horrible."
1.0,"The hat arrived with the face shield separate from the hat. Impossible to get the zipper on, it looked pretty cheap and a bit frayed around the stitching. No way to get the zipper on....just would not slide into the cheap components."
1.0,Dont throw away your money
1.0,Too small for me I somewhat throw it away in the trash was upset
1.0,Horrible chemical smell. When opened the chemical smell made out entire room stink. They are cheaply made and not worth it.
1.0,It runs small. And it looks so cheap! I tried it on and was horrified by how shiny the material looked. What a waste of money.
1.0,Worst product ever with worst package
1.0,Very flimsy break while putting on or dint stay put
1.0,Product looks nothing like the picture. It seems like it was spray painted and smells strongly of spray paint. Something you'd buy at the Dollar Tree and not spend over $16 on.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Sent wrong size.
1.0,No me trajo ni las botas ni el saco
1.0,"These pants are light and the waist fits nicely. However, the crotch is just comical. Looks like I'm about to shoot a porno, or dance in the latest Chippendales show. I have no idea how anyone could wear these.  Maybe it was a bad pair? Either way if you have anything between your legs, I'd recommend passing on these."
1.0,The usb is NOT working..<br />Can‚Äôt charge the lights of the shoes...<br />Crap!!!!!
1.0,The iron on decals peeled off after 1st wash. Progressed even more thereafter.<br />The sleep shirt is snug. I purchased the XL...disappointed it was not as roomy or flowy as indicated in the photo. üòê
1.0,This product arrived to me after one month and it was damaged.<br />This thing very annoyed me.<br />You must have credibility and examination of the goods before shipping them
1.0,"I‚Äôm so disappointed. Worn for the first time today, tied loosely, and simply walking up and down my street, eight out of ten loops in the back have simply torn out. You‚Äôd think I was fighting UFC in this dress with the way the back looks. The dress material itself is very nice, soft to the touch, comfortable, not see through, falls very naturally. But those damn tie loops. Ruined the entire thing."
1.0,hard to put on.  Slip right off the heel.  I don't believe it's silk.  Waste of money.  False advertising.
1.0,"Super long pants. I am 5 foot 3 and they are like 3 or 4 inches too long. Ordered the black and grey flare pairs, received black pants on flare and the grey were like leggings. Ordered the boot cut pair both color black and the sizing was way larger than the first set I ordered even though they were both size large."
1.0,I would give it 0 stars if I could. Purse broke first day I was carrying it! The handle came apart from the bag when I was simply carrying it.
1.0,"Very poorly made, very flimsy SKIP THIS ONE"
1.0,An all black hoodie came not orange and black. Poor material. Cheap costume like clothing at a Halloween store.
1.0,"I'm a big guy and normally wear an extra large, but these were absolutely skin tight. I normally wear the Dickies brand, to which even a Large in those are still very roomy in the shoulders and waist, but I wanted to try something new since these had colours the Dickies didn't have. Unfortunately I've been tricked by the sizing with these and will need to return them. If you're looking to having something skin tight, you can go with these, or you can buy something in a small or medium for $10 cheaper with another brand. If not, stay away from these."
1.0,The silver earrings were bent and unwearable.  The cost was too low to bother sending back.  All earrings were smaller than expected.  I would not recommend.
1.0,"It would have been a flawless beautiful dress but the line right in the middle In front of the dress should have been in the back or at least the sides,  The line In the middle ruined the dress. Maybe the person who made the dress forgot and sewed it wrong, idk."
1.0,"P√©sima la confecci√≥n, hilos sueltos por todos lados, y la tela imperfecta en toda la mitad de la nalga, muy mala calidad no creo que sea beb√© original"
1.0,Did not fit at all and quality isn‚Äôt food
1.0,Quality and value is great but it is the wrong size for Wendell Medallions.
1.0,"This 'US X-Large' fits like a medium, the quality of the vest but way too small to ever be considered an XL. the vest is a dark blue, not black by any means."
1.0,What I received does not look like the necklace in the picture and it's not even metal the necklace I recieved it plastic :/
1.0,"The dress is nice, however i did not like how it fitted me. It was not as long as I expected it to be like it looks on the picture. Im not happy with the dress AT ALL."
1.0,Bought 2 of these. Both of them broke in the exact same way at the same spot within first 2 months. Look elsewhere.
1.0,It took forever to come in the mail.  It does not even stay in my ear.  Can not be used.
1.0,Way too thick
1.0,To small around band
1.0,Material not good.. easily breaks
1.0,I returned this because I ordered much bigger than normal and it's very tight across the chest. It's also a very thin material. I was expecting thicker and higher quality.
1.0,In the item description it says that color could vary because of the monitor. I however did not expect the item to be completely faded and distorted. Very cheaply made. Branches aren‚Äôt even cut out. Learn from my mistake. Please don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,Flattens in the bust and fabric is scratchy.  I returned it
1.0,"The first time I bought this bracelet, it started coming apart and I tried to just be creative and work around it.  And then it finally just fell apart.<br /><br />This was my second time purchasing the bracelet - hoping maybe the first one was a fluke.  Nope - first day I wore it, it started to come unraveled.<br /><br />Very disappointed."
1.0,I purchased this and only liked one ring. And barely at that. Very cheap and poor quality
1.0,broke twice
1.0,"Look, it's not like I'm a connoisseur of Disney pins.  I took 5 minutes to read a website on the internet on how to spot fakes.  Then I looked at this batch that I received.  Out of 30, only 5 could pass as genuine.  And I have my doubts about those.  Did I expect 100% authentic pins for this price?  No, but I did expect a few.  You have to decide whether you want to take these janky pins to the park and trade them to cast members and then have some poor little six year old trade her genuine pin for one.  Ouch."
1.0,Cheaply made & very see through. There's NO way you'd be able to use these to workout in.
1.0,This is very disappointing and frustrating. I ordered something in medium size but I got small. Why? Doesn't any one check the order size before shipping. And the item looks like a cat was wearing it or a dog sleeping on it! It's full of lints. What I'm I supposed to do with this?
1.0,Necklace broke in less than 1 hour of wearing it. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,The back stems were bent. I worn them to match with some of my other butterfly jewelry.
1.0,Pros:<br />- dress seemed well made and comfortable for the price<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Small fit more like a large -- long in all proportions and very wide in hips. I'm 5'3 and the dress came @ 3&#34; below knees; bust and waist curves were low too; had about 3-4&#34; of extra fabric on either side of hips -- plus dress' natural stretchiness)<br />- Red color ordered was very clearly a hot pink color. Pretty color but in no way red.<br /><br />Disappointed because I needed a red dress for holiday family photos.
1.0,Not buying. Less than a week of use and the watch is damaged. I am very disappointed with this watch. I think it came out damaged.
1.0,Too small. No stretch. No give. Cannot wear and will have to give away. However....Nicely woven textile. Well made.
1.0,ai eres de naturaleza delgada te la recomiendo de lo contrario no porque no detiene tus royitos
1.0,The material is not the same as the last neleus.  The size also runs much bigger.  I thought I was purchasing the same workout shirts but apparently it is not.
1.0,"I had posted Avery good rating for these. The black opal is beautiful the design as well. However, they are not sterling! They are silver over copper. The silver wore off and the copper oxidized. I am not happy. I bought this pair and a pair of the tear drops  which I have not worn and I am co Cerberus are the same:("
1.0,When I open the package the studs were bent
1.0,"They look like kid‚Äôs glasses, very small"
1.0,Does not stay together.  Very uncomfortable hard plastic with plastic filter inserts that don't stay in place.
1.0,I ordered the bronze color and received the silver......very heavy pendent
1.0,"The sizes are WAY off, by at least 2 sizes smaller than normal sizing. They would be great if they had correct sizing."
1.0,The screw in threads attached to the stone are way too short and nearly impossible to get them on yourself. I lost 3 while trying to get the stone on 1 earring.
1.0,Very cheap looking. Do not recommend.
1.0,These are cute and seem comfortable but they are NOT for toddlers. More for little girls. My daughter is 16 months and wears a size 6 shoe. These are at least 2-3 times the size of the socks that fit her now. Picture provided for comparison.
1.0,"It looks great, but the rivets are cheesy."
1.0,"The bracelet appears to be good at first, but after just a few months your gotcha will start popping out of it with little to no effort. It appears to hold the Gotcha firmly. However, when the Gotcha falls out, it's hardly noticeable until you go to use it and realize that it's gone, and you have no idea when it fell out."
1.0,Poor quality product. Material feels great but runs very small. Xxl wouldn‚Äôt fit and I wear 36 C. The clasp is poorly made with only 2 prongs.
1.0,The post about the fabric was unclear and miss leading. The print okay. Color not quite right match to a Pee Cher. I guess if you like a thinner shirt it‚Äôs okay.
1.0,Very short - not for those with long upper bodies
1.0,"Love Amazon, this hat was really beat up"
1.0,Bag arrived damaged with huge white scuff!!! I even tried to rub it off and still didnt come off.
1.0,"The rhinestones get stuck together between your legs and don't easily come apart. I had to keep reaching between my legs to tear them apart. They are pretty, but they are a one time wear it even that. I was so upset I wish I would have sent them back."
1.0,Seemed fine at first but even after wearing one day it stretches out too much and had to toss out . - wear in my arm with a work key .
1.0,I bought this for a friend and it never came.
1.0,"The picture of the product shows that it is black and white, but what I received is actually  green and white. Completely wrong color. Would not have ordered it if I had known what color it would be. It does fit on my watch which is good, but still would have liked the color I thought I was ordering."
1.0,I was so excited to get these leggings. I loved the color and the design. However they do not have the tummy control or any sort of elastic in the top of the leggings. I constantly have to pull them up- super disappointed.
1.0,Runs super small.  And material is super cheap. Not at all what I expected
1.0,"For the price they were a deal. I used them for baseball games as an outfielder. Oakleys are great but I hate spending that much $$ on sunglasses.<br /> Inbetween innings the third game I used them, I went to put them on the bill of my hat and they cracked in half with only minimal pressure applied.<br />It was just past the return period and I had more games coming up so I couldn't do anything but try to superglue them. The superglue worked pretty well, but they need to build these better so they don't crack so early"
1.0,So I think I was sent the wrong gauge size. I ordered an 18 gauge but what came looks like 22 as my other ring is larger and is an 18. I‚Äôve alrea lost three due to them falling out so in my opinion not worth the money. They are pretty but the size is just not correct.
1.0,Jeggings were too small and couldn't even go over her legs in order to pull up to her waist.
1.0,I am returning these they left marks on my kids face and ears after only one day at school.
1.0,Cheaply made. Most won't stay together.  Won't order these again.
1.0,Very thin and started coming apart after one washing.
1.0,"Within 2 days of receipt, the interior lining separated from the outer casing."
1.0,They fit my 10 year old granddaughter
1.0,These literally fell apart my first time using them. Honestly just laughed at how cheap they are.
1.0,it fell apart within a day. not recommended.i wish it would have lasted it little longer. i really did love it at first but like i said it fell apart. you get what you pay for :(
1.0,Horrible fit and a waste of money
1.0,This will not fit a regular adult males wrist. It is way too tight. You have to have a very tiny wrist for this to fit you properly and comfortably. The bracelet is made well but there is no give in it which is a little annoying. Was really looking forward to wearing this and buying others
1.0,Wrong number on back from the front. I wish they contacted me to confirm even if it was  my fault.
1.0,Arrive broken
1.0,"It fit too small at the chest, such a cute dress though."
1.0,Do not buy came with weird blue stains
1.0,Two frames showed up with no lenses and no cover on the ear tips!
1.0,chest was way too tight. I wore once and will never wear again.
1.0,Poor quality. Duffle bag arrived the day before our grandson was flying out to visit. All of the outside zippers were broken and did not work. I wonder if this was a return? Very unusual for a product being shipped via Amazon.
1.0,"The craftsmanship is not durable.<br />My granddaughter wore them twice and the rubber on the toe is separated from the sneaker.  She loved the glitter, but sneakers not made well."
1.0,"These are so, so, so small.  They are awful.  Way too small for an adult.  If you buy these as a gift, expect to be returning them, so keep your receipt.  I mean really tiny!!!"
1.0,The shirt was ripped at the seem when it arrived. Poor quality
1.0,Zipper broke after 3 times of wearing it
1.0,"Muy peque√±os, no son como la fotograf√≠a"
1.0,It broke after a week. It worked great when I used it. Just wish it lasted. It caught on clothes and broke.
1.0,"These are poorly designed. The font is too big and with the pleats, you can't read the first word."
1.0,"Light weight, classy-look, comfortable, flowing dress. I really loved it but I wore only 3x and the strap broke off."
1.0,"I specifically bought these because it stated ""Glass lens"" in the title description. After receiving them I found none of them were glass, just regular plastic lens."
1.0,"These shorts are not for someone that a has a real rear (if you know what I mean).  The pad is soooooo thin it feels like a sponge.  I thought the pad would at least cover most of my rear but it only covers a tiny portion of the rear.  I wore them once and of course I couldn't return them.  I wanted them because I ride my bike at least 5 times a week (alternating) as a form of exercise.<br /><br />If anyone can come up with a brilliant idea to give me more cushion, I'm listening.  Already have a wide seat that is good but not enough."
1.0,Stones fell out on the 2nd time wearing this ring.  The larger stone prongs was rough.
1.0,It just wouldn't stay up and the elastic is cheaply made.
1.0,"It‚Äôs horrible and cheap , pretty design ,has no tag inside looks like it came from local hair store imma make it a head wrap because I‚Äôm not finna waste time sending back ."
1.0,side boob is an issue not for heavy-breasted women.
1.0,Bigger than it appears online. Do not buy.
1.0,It is different from the picture. It is a plain silver. Looks cheap. I returned it.
1.0,"turns green after wear, hurt my ears wearing them only wore for a few days not good for sensitive ears at all"
1.0,Everything fit perfectly except for for the length. I am only  5'2 so I cannot even imagine how anyone taller would be able to wear this comfortably. When I am standing normally you can practically see my bottom. I am about 215 and ordered the 3x. I will be returning this dress.
1.0,Received glasses broken. Not Glass pouch either.
1.0,Runs small and it came without the shawl. Returning The first one and I placed an order for another one and the second one came with a shawl. It‚Äôs decent but thin
1.0,"I loved this robe, then I washed it! It shrunk to about a women‚Äôs size small to medium.  It‚Äôs supposed to be unisex, only if you are 12 years old"
1.0,Material is thin and just hangs there showing all the wrong curves lol
1.0,Very cheap made and all the balls on end have broke so easily.  And there was nowhere near the amount they said would be there. Only 64 total.
1.0,"It's awful!!  The main ring doesn't fit inside the ring guard properly at all.  It's so dull, it's awful."
1.0,"I was hopeful for this piece, but it‚Äôs truly awfully made and there‚Äôs no sugar coating it. There really are wires of some kind in between the thin material of the bodice that stick out awkwardly - and no, you can‚Äôt bend them to try and make them slightly more flattering. The ‚Äústraps‚Äù are the thinnest elastic tubes I‚Äôve ever seen on a garment. It‚Äôs truly astounding how the  entire piece is nothing AT ALL like the photos.<br /><br />But the worst is THE SMELL! Holy God. I‚Äôm well versed in textile and garment manufacturing and I‚Äôm used to the specific scents from Bangladesh and Chinese factories, but this is something else entirely! Believe it or not, straight to trash.<br /><br />Spend your hard earned money somewhere else, queens."
1.0,"This is literally a expensive paper weight, complete waste of your money."
1.0,This was made for a doll grrrrrr
1.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for a blazer, this is not it. It came like a shirt with buttons. Very thin. I will be sending it back."
1.0,The slipper was really narrow
1.0,"I‚Äôm pretty sure they only have one size in this. I ordered a medium and received a small, they were AWSOME enough to let me order again in my correct size but when I got the item it was the EXACT same size as the first set they sent. The outfit comes with no actual size on it so you can‚Äôt tell what size it is no matter what. I‚Äôm just disappointed and thought others should know before they waste their money."
1.0,Way tight for 2X
1.0,The photo on this top makes it look loose fitting. It‚Äôs not. It fits tight all the way. It‚Äôs very misreading. I am returning the product
1.0,The dress they sent was NOTHING like the picture. It‚Äôs silk/polyester.  Not even the same style. Shame on them!!  Refund refund refund!!!  Do not buy!!
1.0,Pure plastic not a leather the first day I was trying every thing is came off the don't deserve no star
1.0,"Shirt was a strange material, and looks like the colors were printed on the fabric instead of dyed. It had little green spots in the colors. Not really upset, it was a cheap shirt."
1.0,This is a horrible product. They don't look like the picture at all. I tried my best to make it work but it I just two pieces of sown together!! DONT BUY IT!
1.0,This was a very poor quality necklace! It came out of the package broken. This was supposed to be a birthday gift for my granddaughter who was very disappointed! I live out of state and was very disappointed. The necklace was Definitely not sturdy.
1.0,to small for me.
1.0,The entire emblem fell off while I was walking to my kitchen!
1.0,"Smaller than how they appeared in the images. Blue was so light as to be colorless, no heft or weight to them. Returned."
1.0,I can't seem to get enough room to place the ring guard and/or get the ring over it.  Great idea and it may work fine for some.  It just was a waste of money.
1.0,Ordered a medium and it fits like a XL or bigger.
1.0,I wear a small so i order a medium when it arrive the top was too small but the bottom fits perfect.
1.0,Very disappointed...ordered two and got two of the same. Nothing like on the picture. This was for two elderly women at a church social. Don't have time to send back. Thought it would at least be two different colors...
1.0,broke after I wore it 2 times. get something else
1.0,Beautiful watch. But extremely heavy.
1.0,Fabric is entirely too thin I put it on you can see straight through it to all my tattoos and if you have a shirt under it that is any type of color it shines through more than the actual fabric I recommend you guys use better material
1.0,Pretty too tight at chest
1.0,"Did not even try it on, it came already split at the seams and ripped at the waist. However, it felt very fragile/thin and not well made so I returned it and did not ask for a replacement."
1.0,"My wife said quality was really poor and size ran very small, ordered a large looked like small"
1.0,It did not work and was returned.  Maybe I received a lemon.
1.0,It was not flattering to my figure and I really didn't like the material...
1.0,Can‚Äôt seem to get these to fit our faces. Bad fit. I bought several for all our employees. None of us can. Wear them comfortably. We all went back to paper mask until I can find something better.
1.0,The band is extremely thin and the setting and stones stick far off your finger. It is annoying to wear and unattractive.
1.0,"I ordered two gold pins and so far, all I have received is a silver pin and no word on when the other one will be delivered. I‚Äôm very disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,I bought this at the end of February for my daughters birthday today. Received package and put it in the closet. She opened it today and both tiaras are broken and no option to return or refund since it only had a 30 day return window. She‚Äôs incredibly disappointed as am I. Ridiculous
1.0,"Be careful when buying from them. This dress was too small. I followed the directions to return the dress ( printing out the return label). You have to pay for shipping. I took it to post office to mail with the return label, thinking I would have to pay a few dollars. It came up to $23 ! That‚Äôs almost how much the dress cost! This return goes to China! I would avoid buying from this company. There‚Äôs no way to even contact them. Very disappointed. I‚Äôm stuck with a dress that doesn‚Äôt fit."
1.0,"Beautiful hat but, the creases are so deep I don't think I could ever get them all out.  Even if I soaked it in a hot bath and then reshaped it on a ball, I would still have to iron the brim and try to reshape it to it's original smooth shape.  They've ruined it because of the way it has been folded and stored it for so long.  It's a shame.  I will be returning for a refund."
1.0,This dress looks do pretty hence the reason I bought it but the material is very thin and cheap. I can't understand how because the other dress material was much better than han this one and both was ordered from Homeyee.
1.0,Muy mal echo es una copia del vestido original
1.0,Way smaller than expected.
1.0,Awkward baggy style
1.0,Flimsy black is dark grey white is off white and it's huge
1.0,Does not protect screen if dropped.

1.0,mask was way to big to wear. would not buy or recommend this product to anyone
1.0,"Very very cheaply made , very disappointed would never buy from this person again."
1.0,"When I receive the package it was wet and the package was destroyed when I open up the plastic for the boots water gott inside the boots, and gave them a mildew smell not only did the leather, start to disintegrate because they weren't real leather my gift was ruined"
1.0,"This shirt is far shorter and tinier than I expected from the pictures. I sized up, but it still looked like baby clothes. Way too small."
1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy it, it‚Äôs crap."
1.0,I do not like it. You can't even read what it says. Very disappointed!!!
1.0,"TOO SMALL, IT LOOKS BIGGER IN PICTURES"
1.0,Product dont fit my Fit Charge.  I wasted my money.
1.0,Wore it twice and it fell apart very disappointing
1.0,"Very disappointing. Wanted to return,  but never received an answer from the vendor on how to. I have the large Gloria. When I read 'one size'  I was not aware that they made a small version. My 4 year old granddaughter found it very amusing to having a miniature version of mine. I was purchasing it as a gift for her mother but it really looks like it is made for a small child."
1.0,Chain is eeh the charm sounds like pennies in a empty can of corn.<br />The hollow sounds of the charm and the weight just made me feel like i had just got a price out of the quarter jar twist and turn dispenser.
1.0,"they are ugly but my son loves them. Nothing wrong with them, just my opinion"

1.0,I dodnt Love the material and it was way too big.
1.0,Stone fell out after 1 wear

1.0,They broke right away and difficult to open. Very flimsy.
1.0,A puff and a stain on the the right front side of the dress.
1.0,"Based on the photo and the description I thought I was going to receive a loose, flowing bathing suit cover up. When I received the item is was actually form fitting around my hips. This was because the item was simply a piece of fabric folded, cut, and stitched together. It was very straight with no room. I ordered my correct size. Thankfully, returning it was a breeze. Customer service was very easy to work with. Unfortunately, I would not purchase this item again but I would purchase from this same seller because they were easy to work with and responded quickly."
1.0,Turned...do not buy....so pissed....loved it when I first got it...it was so beautiful üòëüòëüòíüòíüò°üò°
1.0,Not as large as they look in the picture. They're average sized.
1.0,Awful! Couldn't even get over my boobs! I'm usually a large and I had ordered a 2X and it still didn't fit.
1.0,One week after purchasing this key ring the whole mechanism completely fell apart...embarrassing as it was a gift for a friend who had just moved into her new home...
1.0,"A little too snug even though I used the size chart, also wasn‚Äôt a fan of the fabric. Expected a cotton tank but it was more nylon material."
1.0,The photo of this dress makes it look a little bit dressy. I was disappointed when i got it out of the package and saw the material it is made with. It does look like Halloween costume material. It was too loose up top and fit rather snug on the rest of my body. I will return for a refund.
1.0,This is a terrible dress. It does not fit at all like the description. It's way too big and the quality is abysmal. It looks like a toddler sewed it together. Seriously awful.
1.0,Looks frumpy. Wish place went all the way around. Wish color was darker like it looks in picture.
1.0,The material is so itchy and the darker ‚Äúhole‚Äù detailing up close looks super cheap and unflattering. Gymshark leggings may be double the price but at least I can expect quality when I buy them! So disappointed that I returned my order within the same day.
1.0,After you put on glasses it so close to your head you have to undo one side to get around neck the for it to sit on your chest it like chocking you
1.0,I will never buy this product again! The very first time<br />I put a pair on they ripped at the waist. All four pair has torn in in the waist and more embarrassing in the rear end. Please save your money. Do not buy this product.
1.0,"Broke after two weeks, end ball fell off"
1.0,Pretty pattern but fits small
1.0,Don't fit at all!
1.0,"Terrible luggage! The luggage is not sturdy and the zippers broke! I used the luggage once and when I was retrieving it from baggage claim it was wrapped in plastic, courtesy of TSA, because the zipper broke and my items were following out!"
1.0,Cheap Halloween costume material. Like plastic. Horrible material and the size is huge.
1.0,I think I bought a watch but only received a band
1.0,So i ordered a 4xl which is much larger than i would ever order but i was trying to base my guess off of other reviews and when I received it I had to laugh because 4xl fit my size medium sister and was kinda tight. I couldnt believe it but returning was very easy!
1.0,"Terribly made,<br />could see right though areas that seemed like wholes.  very disappointed. I'm adding to this on 1-29-2017. This was an early bought Christmas present. After a month of wearing on and off this garment has tons of wholes around the mid-section.I'm embarrassed for my wife to wear this robe. It's time for a washing and i'm not sure it will hold up. On that note the washing instructions are not in English. Hope to hear from you in a timely manner. Richard Jaffer."
1.0,Too small for tow passports cards and money!
1.0,"Tried several times but after an hour or so, most was 2 1/2 hours, falls off even though pulled on it when put it on each time to make sure was secure. Also design is much bigger than appeared so it just looks like red with white patches."
1.0,The product was was too small nothing close to the size they suggested would fit
1.0,This was disappointing. I assemble it and because of the way it came ( folded flat) it never took in the round shape. It was not worth keeping. The glue/tape didn‚Äôt hold either.
1.0,The black steel did not last. The connection pieces popped out a lot. Even for this price I expected it to be more durable.
1.0,"stitching is terrible,brim is small,crown on hat is huge,looks nothing like the picture...if it did,i wouldn't be writing this...and it's made in china."
1.0,AVOID
1.0,the fit wasn't right in the shoulders.  will be returning it
1.0,I got the navy blue 1st and loved it so I ordered the red one. The material of the res one looks cheap where the ruffles are.  You can see white.
1.0,Too tight. My daughter had it on for about two minutes before taking it off.
1.0,This bathing suit looks like it was sewn by an 8th grader in beginners sewing class. The bottoms were sewn crooked.  It doesn't fit right at all. I do not recommend.
1.0,Way too big. Ordered normal size and it was way too big. Had to return.
1.0,Took it back
1.0,Metal grommets were loose and fell out.
1.0,Sadly my pair tore on my first day wearing them.
1.0,I ordered a large. There‚Äôs no way it was anything less than a small. Runs very small. Material is super thin and not forgiving.
1.0,"I wish Amazon would check how often this happens they say true to size and yet it's  never the right size, and I sized up still wrong size and I needed this for the weekend. So now I have to find something else for the weekend,  disappointed!!"
1.0,This is a terrible quality shirt!  I washed it before my husband wore it and the pattern washed off.
1.0,small not true to size
1.0,Don't waste your money. These were a Christmas gift and they stopped working after 1 very short wear.
1.0,these don't stay up
1.0,They are not worth the price. They were much smaller than what I wanted. I have paid much less for better quality and larger. I will not order jewelry again through Amazon.
1.0,Received this item and it appears to be missing a component(s).  The magnetic closure is missing the magnet as well.  Very unhappy with this purchase and I will return it for a refund.  Don‚Äôt recommend this item.
1.0,Ordered a large because I like it roomy and comfortable. Don't think an extra small could fit into this.  Material not at all pleasant.
1.0,"I was neverous about ordering something that had no reviews, lesson learned. As soon as I opened this a touched it I knew I'd be returning it. It feels like it would fall to pieces in the wash. It looks like there was a tag but it was torn off? I tried it on anyway and it's literally like a sports bra with sleeves."
1.0,This dress is completely see thru!  other than that- it would of been an amazing 4th of july dress.
1.0,It's made of box carton paper! It pilled of after two uses!
1.0,"The balls on this lip ring ended up being a lot bigger than expected. It looks pretty ridiculous on my face so I'll never wear it unless I'm dressing up in some kind of elaborate costume that would require a large, bulky blue lip ring."
1.0,"I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 220 lbs. I bought the 3x and it fits perfectly. However, I had this item for a week and a half one of the metal bones started poking out of the fabric:( I honestly love this item and am very sad that this happened."
1.0,I had to return it. Doesn't fit the 38 mm correctly. Color pattern is beautiful though
1.0,This watch is a piece of crap. It arrived broken and because it's &#34;under warranty&#34; I had to mail it to the manufacturers. I had to pay for postage AND pay for them to mail it back to me. Then it immediately broke again after one day of wear. I finally took it to a jeweler who fixed it properly. But DO NOT BUY IT!
1.0,This shirt is cheaply made.  The sleeves are not hemmed.  Its very big for a small.  Flares out at the bottom so even if you tie it it will be baggy.  I'm returning it.
1.0,Ripped immediately in several places. Awful material
1.0,I dont like this at all...pant design is hillarious...its too open..its full attached set...but it looks like second hand...vry dull colour...not  looks like very new...
1.0,Won't charge... ordered again...Same thing
1.0,I found that the slippers although a great idea and a decent price with very clumsy to wear an inconvenience to plug-in I returned them
1.0,"I didn't like any part of them -- the color was fine, but black is black, isn't it?  I'm afraid they joined some other clothes I am donating to Hospice..."
1.0,this shirt is so thin!!!
1.0,Horrible... my fingers had black circle around them... waste of money.
1.0,The shoes were not in the original box. It looked as if they had been worn and then returned. Soles looked dirty and logo on foot pad looked worn as well.
1.0,"I think it's interesting and sketchy that the picture of these glasses clearly show that they are OD4<br /><br />There is very little documentation here... I wouldn't mess with it, when it comes to a 1.5 Watt laser at 445nm... Too Bad"
1.0,It‚Äôs bent and curved in such an awkward way that it doesn‚Äôt rest right on your stomach. Cute in the picture but in reality I‚Äôm not sure why they would bend it the way the did. Waste of money
1.0,Mask way to small and barely covers my face!!
1.0,"After one day , Grandson complained  he can‚Äôt wear them ... even after adding a cushion to it."
1.0,"Bought 2, same size different colors. Firstly I was disappointed that the fabric is so heavy. Just trying it on I felt hot and uncomfortable. I can‚Äôt imagine wearing this fishing or camping.<br />Secondly, the gray color one is super short! I‚Äôm talking looking like Gus Gus from Cinderella so no picture of that one. Then I tried the olive color one and it is huge! Super long sleeves and comes down to my mid thigh. To make matters worse it has seams with lots of threads coming undone on the inside of the shirt.<br />Not worth it IMO. Great price point, but not a good product unfortunately.<br />For reference I wear L shirts in other similar cut shirts (REI, Columbia)."
1.0,"As soon as it showed up I pulled the reel out to check it out as it was to be a gift for my boyfriend. The reel would not go back in. Also, the pictures were so dark. I do not recommend buying. I threw it away. What a waste of money."
1.0,Liked absolutely nothing about it.
1.0,The color was completely different than in the picture
1.0,I do like the look of the shoes but that is all I can say they are NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL VERY DISAPPOINTED$$$!!!
1.0,If you're wearing a sling the material is such that the sling slides around on it and doesn't stay stable. Runs small in size.<br />Review update - I've washed this shirt 3 times and it already looks terrible. I'm changing the stars from 3 to 1. I do not recommend.
1.0,"They are too short, very thin, snug and baggie in the wrong places. I will not be using them to wear for anything other than sleeping."
1.0,Quality is not good....the fabric knots up and knits up...Very expensive for very low quality.
1.0,Save you money returned
1.0,"Afraid to take out the plastic bag! Anklet is so thin and small, can't tell if there are beads on it! Packaging is terrible, only a plastic bag! To small to even want to wear, I'm sure it will break. Not going to try it! Returning immediately! Don't buy! No Star Rating!"
1.0,This item runs very small. Plus when you request s refund you must pay the shipping to China. Also you only get 1/3 of the price. I got to keep the<br />Onesie but what am I going to do with it?  It won‚Äôt fit my grandson and  half of the purchase price and keeping the item does me no good
1.0,Doesen't work!!!!! Has not batery on!!!!
1.0,Send wrong pants and never heard back in regards to return.  Would not recommend.

1.0,This watch stopped working after 1 month.
1.0,The neck a trap broke after wearing only once
1.0,"Terrible chinese knockoff, the patch is a badly stuck on transfer which looks nothing like the image.  Absolute cr@p"
1.0,One size does not fit all. It is real tight on chest.
1.0,I bought these in January saving them for the summer. I already had a black pair that I love and they are wide and fit me great. They must have changed the sizing because I got this new pair out and they are a totally smaller fitting shoe. They say they are the same size but if you hold them together you can even see the difference. Wish I had tried on before the 30 day return policy was up. Beware if buying a second pair based on old size you have.
1.0,WOW this runs small. I sized up one and even still I couldn‚Äôt even zip it up.  What a waste of money üò≠
1.0,Very disappointed! Way too small for a toddler!
1.0,"It smelled like somebody spray painted a tire, the smell was so strong you could smell it from several feet away. Put it back in the box and sent it back. The smell gave me a headache almost instantly."
1.0,Was to small Unable to wearbuteas nice looking
1.0,It was awful had cheap black ribbon in it cheap material to small was supposed to b a xx lg  look like it's from the dollar store. Never never buy from China  never. Hugh mistake they were hideous
1.0,Arrived quick but was disappointed the extension for the lock was missing.
1.0,not even close to a xxl unless whoever is buying it is looking for a belly shirt!!
1.0,To everyone I DON'T RECOMMEND that you buy this product I am very disappointed and unsatisfied with it all around. I bought the item as a gift for my child and not even a week later the pendant part of it had started to turn black and whatever coating they used on it was all peeling off like someone just painted the silver on it and it ended up being a black heart. Anyways I was so upset and my daughter was heart broken never the less. So I will never buy this again!!!!!! And I hope you that reads this DOESN'T ITHER. Thank you. Donna C

1.0,The pin connecting the two metal parts of the belt broke within two months of usage.
1.0,The silver part was black. It looks burned
1.0,"Was happy to find these Nylon Watch Band Straps as the original watch I purchased had replaceable Nylon bands.  After several years, the replacement bands, that came with my watch, were not available any longer for purchase.  Once I saw these I was happy and purchased two.  I didn't have the band on more then once and it started to fray.  The lock didn't stay in place and the band kept falling off my wrist.  I was surprise that it didn't last even one day before it started to fray.  Not happy at all with these bands and will not purchase again."
1.0,I wouldn't recommend buying. It looks like it would fit a child
1.0,"cheaply manufactured, low quality product, and sizing ran REALLY small."
1.0,My fault waiting till return window closed. The material is so thin and cheap if you scratch your nails will probably go through.
1.0,This top was very small. Maybe sized for a child. Returning

1.0,"does not look like the picture at all - very small, less detailed"
1.0,"The is green and navy blue, NOT black. Was looking for specific colors for our Christmas photo and am disappointed the shirt isn‚Äôt green and black like the description says. The bow tie is black however.. now I have to photoshop my sons shirt in our photos."
1.0,How long did it take for you all to get these?<br />I'm over 2weeks now.<br />I love the print and such and prefer not to be scammed.
1.0,After one trip the middle suitcase has a big gash in the front. I was so embarrassed at the airport.
1.0,It got rusty after wearing it for the first time wow
1.0,I did not like the material !
1.0,Nice box but one of the two winders stopped working after about 6 months. No reply from company. Just waiting for the second side to stop and I'll be left with a big useless box.
1.0,Looks frumpy didn‚Äôt care for it at all
1.0,I ordered an adult XL and it looks like a kids medium so I returned the product.
1.0,This is a waste of time and money
1.0,The dress was very large and ugly.if you do want to buy this dress I would suggest you go down 1 or 2 sizes .
1.0,The quality is not good. It was already damaged.

1.0,Recieved today and it's missing a stone :(
1.0,This is nothing like it appears in the picture... It's terrible so please dint waste your money on this.
1.0,This is a really cheap shirt. Feels like an old hanes t that some one cut the holes out of. Mine was ripped in the arm pit area before I even wore it. Would not recommend!!!
1.0,Super thin and transparent. The cuff came loose after one washing. Cheap material and craftsmanship. Not a good buy.
1.0,"Totally different style than shown.<br />Shows a thigh-length, swing-coat with sleeves that are ruched just below the elbow but are actually plain, rather than ruched below the elbow.<br />Shows a big hood that extends to the shoulders when flat.  Hood is much smaller, extending only to mid shoulder when flat.<br />Length is mid hip instead of mid thigh.<br /><br />Zero ease, but even without considering the ease issues, the sizing is considerably off by an estimated 9 sizes.<br /><br />Color is wrong as well.  Color shows a greyed dark blue, color is just a dark blue.nothing matches.<br /><br />I am just slightly taller than medium heighth."
1.0,"Decepci√≥n,la piedra es completamente incolora lo que hace dudar de su autenticidad lo ped√≠ porque dice genuina amatista verde pero por su apariencia no lo es para nada."
1.0,These shoes rubbed my 3-year-old‚Äôs heels. She got blisters on her heels after wearing them for about 2 hours. I think the seam on the heel is to blame. Not a thoughtful design. We went back to the Keen Newport H2 sandals.
1.0,"These are much smaller than advertised.  I purchased XL and I don't know if they are cut weird, or just small, but they are not a good fit."
1.0,Very disappointing. The wrong label must have been sewn in because I don't think these would qualify as a small size.
1.0,"I am normally a size 9/10 in jeans, thus i went with the large and I couldn't not get it zipped. I se t it back for an extra large and the bottom for snug and the top was any too large."
1.0,The first and second watch we ordered came with a dead battery!
1.0,One of the arms is longer than the other üò¶ and I did not expect the material to be so thin.
1.0,"I finally wanted to wear my new cuff and already felt that the bar screws into the cuff a little loose. Anyway, I put it on, it looked great, I commuted to work and when i got there I had lost the bar and the cuff was in my sweater sleeve.<br /><br />Way to waste my money. I wore it all of 25 min... and 20 of them I calmly sat on a bus. Very disappointing that the bar just wouldn't screw in tight enough to keep the cuff together and on my arm."
1.0,Cute but lobster claw finish starting to tarnish but cross is beautiful
1.0,Low quality.  One pair fell apart on first wear.  Others seem stringy and cheap.  Will not purchase from this company again.

1.0,Company that doesn‚Äôt bother to get back to you if you need to exchange!!!! Sweet thanks a bunch
1.0,Not all how they are pictured...extremely thin and look cheap....I expected them to be taller and much more thick....the writing is small. Not happy....would give 0 stars if I could.....the only thing positive is they were delivered in the time frame!
1.0,Color fit
1.0,You can dress this up or down and it looks great.  Machine washable and holds up well.
1.0,"I ordered 2 pairs and only received one pair. Not amused about my money being spent on something I didn't receive. product itself is just ok, it isn't a wow."
1.0,Extremely thin material and ran a bit small
1.0,Got the shirt NOT the shorts. Little expensive for shirt only!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt the one in the picture description
1.0,The arms/sleeves are super short.
1.0,Way too big for a child that would be of age to enjoy Daniel Tiger.
1.0,Came with one horn.
1.0,Really flimsy material.
1.0,"To small, only size in stock.."
1.0,"They were easy on, after a pair of scissors they were easy off. I wouldn‚Äôt buy these again."
1.0,"Please don't buy this watch. This is just a rebranded version a Chinese watch you can buy on DX for about $7. I know because I bought this watch, for $7, from DX."
1.0,"Way too tight, uncomfortable/cheap material, completely non-flattering. They over priced this dress"
1.0,in less than a week color is flaking off and tarnishing. poor quality
1.0,This was really small and paper thin
1.0,Nothing like the photo..cheaply made..didn't even wear it because it looked hideous..so disappointed
1.0,Junk  Went through two of these in four months.  Quit working right after the 30 warranty.  Pure junk.
1.0,"Save yourself the pain and frustration, and go look at different options, please.<br /><br />I've had the clicker in for about 36 hours, and it is killing me. The pain I am experiencing right now is unbearable! A blanket just brushed up against my nose, and I stafted tearing up. That's how awful these are.<br /><br />&#34;Well, why don't you just take it out?&#34; Yeah, the clicker won't budge. I've been trying for about six hours now, and nothing is helping at all.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today is February 23rd. I STILL am unable to get this ring out. The inside of my nose has swollen, and the clicker is stuck."
1.0,"This fabric is horrible.  Not soft at all, incredibly thin and almost papery.  You can see right through it - definitely would need a slip.  The dress runs large, and the shoulders are ridiculously broad, so the sleeves just look wrong.  It arrived super wrinkled as well, so if you can get past the thin, see-through fabric and bad fit, you would also need to steam it.  I‚Äôll be sending this back.  The price is low so I wasn‚Äôt expecting top quality, but this isn‚Äôt wearable."
1.0,"SHIRT FIT, BUT THE MATERIAL WAS FOR PAJAMAS, THIS IS NOT FOR GOING OUT IN. LOOKS LIKE A LARGE PJ TOP, WOULDNT BUY AGAIN"
1.0,"Defective, ugly"
1.0,Dont waste your time and money Tarnished green with in a week of wearing. Not real silver.
1.0,"HORRIBLE. I ordered the light pink in a size medium. It fits fine but the material is SO thin and SO see-through. I could literally see my belly button (and everything else) through the material with it on. The fabric is so thin and feels so so cheap, like it is going to unravel if one string comes loose. Also, the pictures are not a good representation of color.I will definitely be returning."
1.0,Crappy everything pretty much. The worst thing which I wasn't expecting was the fabric is a really stiff plastic feel so it doesn't fall nicely it's stiff and pokey and the pleats look terrible as a result. Also it's much longer than pictured and the hearts have pins stuck into them in the print so it's kinda creepy versus cute like in the photo. I was really disappointed with this skirt.
1.0,The pictured item is not the item that was sent.  The item pictured is a higher cut sock which is what I wanted.
1.0,It's like someone painted black over stainless steel in a hurry. Unfinished paint job on the edges of each section. You can see silver in between when you wear the watch and the most important part it doesn't have the sharp edges and the deep cut in the middle. Returning it.
1.0,Not the quality I was expecting. The cups are too small for the size ordered and not secured in place. Cheap material
1.0,Fabric was silky curved in toward my mouth which caused the mask to keep being sucked in or shift too much when I talked. Designs where also stretched as well as pixelated.
1.0,Quality was not what I expected<br />Had to return<br />Waiting for refund.....
1.0,"Middle hook loop thingy broke, had to take to a jeweler to fix"
1.0,"I hop d this mask would work well with hearing aids, but my hair stuck out terribly."
1.0,Very cheap. I opened and the lens immediately fell out of the frame. Probably gonna Return.
1.0,"My intention was to use this for the gym. I am a strength/power lifter. However, I do actually wear a 2X or XXL. At this size, these actually fit like a Medium or Large. Beware of this before you buy!"
1.0,Turned orange after 4 wears.
1.0,Description misleading
1.0,The item was way too big and the seller did not want to take them back. They said my child would grow into them eventually. I ended ul filing a claim.
1.0,"Chain came tangled with a million knots and after hours of fixing this, chain broke with little effort. Coin looks outstanding but chain is absolute garbage"
1.0,In the description it says a pair of sleeves but I only received ONE.  Are you going to send me the other one?
1.0,Runs very small. Haven‚Äôt been able to wear.
1.0,Very thin cheap material and the arm length is too short.
1.0,"Only good thing I can say about these earrings is they were very sparkly. But I had to return them because they were missing some rhinestones, I end up ordering the same earrings from another seller on Amazon and they were Awesome!!!!"
1.0,"The trucks have a very short inseam Poor quality  . Buyer  BEWARE , Starting to be the normal on Amazon with a lot of<br />products. MISREPRESENTATION ON A LOT OF PRODUCT."
1.0,"Photos show how HUGE these masks are on my Daughter-in-Law. In what universe would they fit a 7 or 9 year old child? I ordered 2 sets, they arrived at 2 different times.  Amazon refunded the 1st set immediately.  However, they have requested that I return the second set, which is troublesome to me.  Will they be discarded or repackaged and re-sold?  As a responsible consumer I will not be returning them as my grandchildren had tried them on prior to my initial complaint."
1.0,"If they had a rating for -1 star I would use it, this is the same quality jewelry you receive from the 50cent machine at your local grocery store heck you may be better off with that. This junk necklace broke just taking it out of the package!"
1.0,My model is ID115U and it did not fit.
1.0,"Tights didn‚Äôt get to waist height, they were way to short."
1.0,"Bought for my daughter, they look nice, but the first set had one with a very bent post and the other was missing a post.  Sent in exchange and when we received the replacements they were also broken the exact same way. Save your money and order something else."
1.0,"Cheep, cheep, cheep.  You get what you pay for.  Or in this case, less."
1.0,Ok . Talk about bait and switch the waist band on these is a tiny piece of elastic that was bunched when I got it. FAIL . The material is cheap and itchy and overall these are going back. Save your money.
1.0,"just received the boots and tryed them on and they don't fit . I normally wear a 7 1/2 so I bought an 8 and their to narrow now I have to admit I do have fat feet but. I had my daughter try them on and she has narrow feet and wears a 7 and she couldn't fit the either......  I am so blown , I wanted to wear them to a 70's party this weekend"
1.0,eyelets falling out after using 1 week
1.0,NOT ACCEPTABLE. The print on the T-shirt is not straight and is printed terribly askew. I am not pleased with this product at all!
1.0,"Too big, they slide down looking down, cheap!"
1.0,"Cheap, cheap!  Cuter on model in picture.  Deceiving!"
1.0,They arrived on time..but the heel is'nt whats shown on the picture I ordered..They are dirty & very thin like a very cheap material definetly not worth the price advertised at all..as you walk the shoe leans out around the foot..I'm disappointed they were far more appealing in the picture advertisement..I may return these not worth $53
1.0,Fake. Pretending there real Vuarnet sunglasses.  Deceitful.  I am returning them.  Scam.
1.0,It was way too small. The tag said large but I had to give it to someone else because it must have been missed labeled
1.0,I ordered a xl and these gloves are like a medium. Returning them. I can‚Äôt even get them on. My wife who wears a women‚Äôs medium says they are tight on her.<br />Even the cuffs are to small to fit over her jacket.
1.0,they tarnish super fast and they‚Äôre small!
1.0,These jackets are absolutely horrible. So small and cheap. Seller is a absolute nightmare to deal with. Stay clear!!!
1.0,I followed the suggested sizing and it was way too small. I sent it back.
1.0,Will be sending this garbage back to Amazon.
1.0,"Doesn't keep time.... stops when you are still, like when you sleep. It looks nice, though."
1.0,"Would barely fit a Toddler, I lost my money on this thing"
1.0,Really funky fit and not flattering.  Runs large ....
1.0,Smelled like new tires! They fit fine and we're comfortable enough but I couldn't get over the strong rubber smell. I tried airing them out for a few days but it didn't get any better... sent back.
1.0,"This was, quite frankly, a piece of garbage.  It was sealed in a vacuum tight package.  Why I am not sure but it IS NOT SHERPA. It is cheaply made and the nastiest material I have ever seen."
1.0,"It looks pretty in picture but when you get it, its really bad. I was like I wasted money on this.:("
1.0,This is not an authentic Kate Spade bag. Do not waste your money.
1.0,"Horrible!  Rec‚Äôd short sleeve girls shirts instead of long sleeve boys shirts, holes in 2 and beach spot on 1.  These are definitely returns/rejects!!!  One of the tags had a different size on it than the shirt tag."
1.0,Rough material!  Runs at least 2 sizes too small!
1.0,"Color was not ther same as advertised.  In the picture looks very bright,  which is the reason i bought it. In reality,  color is very dull.  Very dissapointed for the price i paid for it."
1.0,NEVER EVER ORDER THIS DRESS!!! It is horrible. Looks nothing at all like the picture. Color is orange copper it feels like Christmas tree tinsel!! It is the worst thing I have ever seen. I might throw it in my closet to use as a Halloween costume one day!! I would have gave 0 stars but it made me select 1
1.0,"Cheap! Pocket had a hole, did not wear yet. Not as pictured üëéüèæ"
1.0,"don‚Äôt waste your money ir time. these earrings are so poorly and cheaply made. they fell apart upon first wear, beginning to unravel almost immediately. requested a replacement pair and the same thing happened. three strikes aren‚Äôt needed for me."
1.0,My son wore these once to the gym and they broke. They look great though.
1.0,"I ordered one of this dress in the beginning of the summer when it was sweltering hot. Dress was very nice and super soft. I loved it. However, it was too large and hanging on me so I returned it and bought another one size smaller. Order was placed back in July and the delivery update said it would be delivered 8/11 - 9/1. It is way past due and still no dress. I've moved on and bought more things from Amazon and this dress got buried deeper in the order history. If I have forgotten about the dress, there goes my money. And unfortunately, similar situations has happened to me at least twice before. That's over $100 of free money, if I hadn't keep each of these dresses in mind. These sellers would always blame the problem on delivery but it seems to be a common practice now."
1.0,These shoes are browner in person they look in the picture.
1.0,beans ate it
1.0,"So I like the neoprene and it definitely holds my glasses, but the snap broke the third time I used it.  The snap on the neoprene just isn't sturdy enough."
1.0,These are cheap shorts. Quality is not there
1.0,Would like to return for bigger  size.
1.0,My friend owned a pair of these sunglasses and had let me borrowed them. After I gave them back I knew I had to have my own. So I ordered them (she also ordered them off Amazon) and I wore them JUST ONCE before the two arms on the side just fell off the frame. I was so disappointed. For the amount of money I paid I expected more from the product. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning them. I want to order them again but afraid of the same thing happening.
1.0,"Shirts fit fine. The padding/lining needs to be more secure. Pad moves way to much. Doesn‚Äôt stay in place. Wore them once and put them away, not to wear again"
1.0,Like just didnt have anyhing bigger then what i ordered .
1.0,Dosent look like cat ears at all. Cheaply mad.
1.0,Fit was weird. Very short torso proportion.
1.0,The pants are awful quality and size
1.0,"Do not buy!! It falls apart fast. I purchased January 2019, and already have a strap coming off, main zipper broken and side pocket zipper split. These are not due to weight or over stuffing. All due to just normal use. I wish I could return it. At first, it was great light weight, lots of pockets and it did what I needed. So glad I didn‚Äôt buy others. DO NOT BUY!!"
1.0,"The beads that are supposed to be black obsidean on this bracelet started peeling. The paint peeled off exposing a clear stone (not sure if they are even real gemstones underneath).  Also, natural hematite is naturally magnetic, the hematite in this bracelet is not magnetic, again not sure what it is or if it is even a real natural stone or color-treated glass. Just know they are not hematite beads. The cat's eye also seems mass-produced replicas as they all have the same pattern, this also would not occur in natural tigers/cats eye. The jury is still out on them unless of course they should start peeling and I will update."
1.0,"I bought socks from the &#34;As Seen On TV&#34; aisle that are supposed to keep my feet extra warm because they are &#34;infused&#34; with aluminum fibers.<br /><br />My review?<br /><br />I've started 2 fires by touching paper, electrocuted my dog, blown 3 fuses by turning on lights, hovered inches off the ground from some weird static electricity hoverboard field, cooked a chicken,  turned the microwave on by walking 3 feet in front of it while tasting battery in my mouth.... And my feet are still cold."
1.0,"Turned copper after 1 weeks wear, it is not real sterling."
1.0,"Even ordering an XL my 10 year old grandson at 115# can,t even get it on because it's so small.  I guess this was somebodies idea of a joke.  Amazon is about to lose a customer.  Save your money this thing is  pure trash and sadly I'm stuck with it. Would coast more to send it back."
1.0,"These leggings are not very flattering. The pictures made it seem like they were thicker but the material thinner than I expected. Also, the material is not stretchy/elastic enough especially at the waist. While these leggings fit at the waist, once you have them on, if you are curvy they have to slide up your hips. So you end up stretching the waist (which really need to fit snugly to prevent them from sliding down during squats and such) just to get them leggings on. I think these leggings need more spandex and a little less polyester."
1.0,The material on this look so cheap! :(  & the size are ways to off.  Need to improved your online Description .
1.0,"Definately not satisfied. One earring broke, and the peice that broke off, I can't find to send it back. The one remaining was difficult to place in my ear, and I can't get it to &#34;latch.&#34;"
1.0,Horrible quality and it completely fell apart the second I clipped it on my wallet. I would like a refund.
1.0,Nunca me llegaron
1.0,Not at all shaped / not true mirror / not true color as pictured with blond model. It did come w a nice case and screwdriver and cloth.  But I purchased for the style first which didn't pan out. üòû Did get a prompt refund.  So thank you Amazon and VivienFang for that.
1.0,The cargo pockets are to small
1.0,Only got 6 out of the 10 pieces I purchased
1.0,Muy feo
1.0,Pulled the hair on my arm as it was uncomfortable on my ankle.
1.0,I was not impressed with this bag. The picture that was posted for this product at the time was misleading and it looked like a cute bag to carry everyday items in made with decent quality. But I found out that the bag had no room to put anything but a tiny computer and that's about it. Plus the quality of hte bag is super stiff and bad quality. I would give this negative stars if I could for the money I paid for it.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:48b5177b4031c70d99b26a5a3421e6d0]] Used, not glass, bent, loose screws.  Not even the same style as pictured.  The only thing they got right was the sunglasses part."
1.0,Have had about a month and the hill has fell off
1.0,Didn't really receive socks
1.0,Not even big earnings hated em
1.0,I had to get it altered at the top. Not what I expected
1.0,Not glittery at all. It‚Äôs more of an orange color with white spots. It looks thin and cheap.
1.0,I was shocked it was only one pair. Not worth the price .
1.0,I am an average sized adult female and these were much too big for my face.  Each ear loop needed to be at least an inch smaller and the facial covering was much too large.  Recommend for men and/or people with wide faces.  I returned this item.
1.0,Product poorly fitting. Too tight on chest and arms. Had to return twice. Button fell off first try on. Poorly made.
1.0,"I was very excited for these, I tried them on at them fit great! I washed them and wore them a few days later and they ripped right where the tag is on the seam and split up my leg. Don't buy if you are active, they do not move well and they aren't good quality. They split the first time wear them."
1.0,This is a COUNTERFEIT/UNLICENSED/PIRATED product!  I'm fairly certain it is illegal to sell this in the USA.
1.0,Thus dress arrived with no size tag and it is very small. No way is it a xxl. My guess is it‚Äôs a large. Not even close to fitting.
1.0,The were cute but broke one hour after wearing them. Poor quality.
1.0,"The quality is about what I would expect for the price. This is just my initial thought on the durability.  I haven't used them.  The printing however was terrible. Perhaps it was the only bad one but I suspect not.  I'll try again, we'll see..."
1.0,The silver wore off after wearing it for one day and my granddaughter s finger turned green.
1.0,They aren't red they are pink. They are cheap and the ear pieces are loose. Could have bought better shades at the dollar store üòÇ
1.0,Way too small..like a training bra for pre-teen.p
1.0,Not worth it.  The black zigzag doesnt go all the way around.  Looks silly and very cheaply made.  Would not recommend.
1.0,I usually am a small but the small was way too small. I returned for a medium and that was also too small.
1.0,This item was returned already because it did not fit.  Thank you.
1.0,I have the same hat in red color same size but the blue one fits 10 times tighter
1.0,"Excellent construction and design but microscopic, this thing is the size of my thumb and gets lost inbetween the keys.  the clip is so small it refuses to fully latch onto my belt loops without messing around, and has multiple times dropped my keys because it wont latch.  If it was made an inch or two larger I would gladly buy again and even pay $30 for this well made product."
1.0,"This was awful.  The necklace twisted up in TWO places and I couldn't unsnap it!  I do not recommend this to anyone.  Clearly, they need to use a different metal or a smooth type.  I didn't return it because I was overly busy during this period and it's too late to exchange."
1.0,Stretched out after a month and caused irritated skin when I worked out.
1.0,"Like the other reviewer said, the whole thing is made of a cheap felt material. Even the hat. Come on... a baseball hat made of felt! When I opened the package, the first thing I thought was, there's no way I would ever were this. It was like something you made in home economics class. Save yourself some time and grief, look elsewhere."
1.0,A complete rip off. It was just a piece of cloth with a piece of tape at the top. No way to attach. No instructions. No anything. Cheaper to go to a fabric store and buy 1 1/2 piece of cloth and tape to sink.
1.0,It looks nice when the model wears it. Its made of poor materials looks very cheap when i wear it didnt bother returning bc its from china.
1.0,bad quality and too expensive!!!!
1.0,The quality of the ring is so bad that the color has been returned after wearing it for a long time. Why are such poor products put out for sale
1.0,"Do not buy this. Very cheap looking, discolored. Very bad that‚Äôs all I can say."
1.0,This is not a proper painting board. Not coated. Shipped in a box smaller than the item so it is bent in half.  I have a pile of cardboard I could have used instead of paying 10 bucks for this piece of junk.
1.0,"Garbage they arrived on time however all broken Len's not even be pink like I ordered,and lens don't fit the frame temple all crooked."
1.0,this came with the logo upside down.
1.0,Great smock for children. Way to small for anyone else. I felt totally ripped off.
1.0,They look nothing like the picture and the size was way to big
1.0,Disappointed to find there were no pink slippers or pink jewelry.
1.0,"shirt is nothing like picture, no camisole in package. returned item"
1.0,"The watch is poorly made. The tool to adjust the band is even worse. The tool kept breaking and i was unable to wear the watch. The pins are thin wires bent in half. If you squint, this watch is mint."
1.0,The material is extremely thin. Feel like craft material not something to wear. Runs small. Not flattering at all.
1.0,One of the Velcro dots came off with the first time use.  I had to glue it with super glue to put it back on.<br />üòû
1.0,"Odd, too small fit with sleeves way too long! Weird fit. Am returning ."
1.0,didn't clean my jewelry hardly at all.
1.0,Not thrilled with the sewing style of these leggings. Run a little smaller than expected.
1.0,We're concerned with potential lead content since the rings are made in China.
1.0,The case and mirror are dirty.
1.0,Fit at the top snug and cut of the skirt was odd and hung funny.  Neither size I ordered was flattering and return shipping cost to China is buyers responsibility. Wouldn't have ordered if I'd realized return/shipping policy.
1.0,"They are okay, minimal compression at best.."
1.0,Old t shirt
1.0,"Sent product back for a refund because it looked cheap, and 2 months later I still haven't received my refund.."
1.0,"This was to small for a womens size, my child ended up wears it to play in."
1.0,Leather was unraveled when it came in.
1.0,Horrible.  They must have used a female blouse pattern to make this thing.
1.0,"I'm so upset right now! Open the box, and it's missing the cuff links entirely!! Now I know u get what u pay for, so I wasn't expecting the tie to be if excellent quality, but to be missing the cuff links? This was a gift for my father, and now it's too late to order another one in time for Christmas!! So disappointed!!"
1.0,"Ill fitted , cheap fabric"
1.0,YOU DO NOT GET 2 - you get one and one filter no directions on who to clean and nothing on how to order more filters.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  I thought I was getting 2 - RGK Aegis 2 Form-Fitting Reusable Adult Safety Covering (Single) - Insertable Filter for Extra Protection
1.0,I came unraveled within days
1.0,"It says that it is a freshwater pearl, it's plastic and huge. Looks nothing like the photo. Very misleading."
1.0,"Save your money $$. This is NOT one size fits all, unless you have a smaller head. It does have a plastic extender in the back, but the crown is the size of a childs ballcap. I wear a 7 5/8&#34; and couldn't get it to stay on the top of my head. My buddy has a Cinch ballcap and this is not even close in sizing. It does look relly nice, just really disappointed it wouldn't fit. Had to send it back."
1.0,"I had left a good review I got the item and it seamed awesome we took it on a trip my five year old was wearing the the zippers got stuck and one of the tabs broke off one of the cables stopped working , do your self a favor go buy the real think for the price we pay I expected quality, super disappointed the bag gave me such a hard time because my kid kept getting frustrated with it."
1.0,I didn‚Äôt like the idea that it broke so quick!! Very upset it was for my great granddaughter she‚Äôs 13 and takes very good care of her jewelry!! So disappointing!!
1.0,"# 1. The colors were not what you displayed on the website. You did give a *Color Disclaimer, but these colors are not even close to the ones I ordered. As I looked back on your website I realize that all of your colors are either 17103 or 17104 perhaps that is what is causing the mix-up in my orders and maybe others.<br />I ordered 17103 purple and received 17104 wine<br /># 2.  I really did not like the quality of fabric, very thin.  I had never bought this brand before because if I had I would not have ordered this product.<br /># 3.  The pockets are also loose on the inside instead of sewn in.<br /># 4.  I gave you 1 star because the fit was correct and received it promptly.<br />I'm returning mine."
1.0,"This dress was a nightmare (to say the least). The design was inspired by the dress in the photo but DOES NOT look like the photo. The lotus design over the breast area was barely visible due to the breast pads being so large. I ordered a XS but the dress was not XS in size. The area that was made to fit the hips was too high. The zipper barely worked. The lace was not transparent, but instead it was a medium brown color. Requested a return within 15 minutes of opening the package."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Hurts to wear. Has lining barely enough to cover your behind. No zipper as pictured. Inseam under chest..which is not pictured. Returning!
1.0,Didn't work at all and looked used when opened not good quality.  Would refer this product would also remove from being purchased. Not happy at all.
1.0,Upon opening package the feathers are falling out all over the place.
1.0,The part that goes through your piercing is too large.
1.0,Not same as the picture shown.
1.0,The cheap 'metal' buckle held up 2 weeks.
1.0,"Paid for the 5"" and prime delivery - received the 3"" - What a rip off. Cheap vinyl too. I know it's only six buck I lost, but that's a nice latte from Starbucks."
1.0,This is nothing like the pics it smells like chemicals & cigarettes üö¨ it is NOT a sweater or sweatshirt it‚Äôs a weird T-shirt material that fits odd NOT true to size it‚Äôs extremely small & odd shape.... it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs china junk because it looked cute in the pics..... VERY dishonest seller
1.0,"Weirdest fit ever, cut bad."
1.0,"I would say if you wanted to order this crap, order a size up.  I ordered for my son for summer camp and his toe bust through after one month.  Cheap. The end"
1.0,Idk why they're made the way they are and the mold doesn't work. Wasted money but I could've just done a horrible job too
1.0,"The listing really made me think this jumpsuit was made out of velvet.  It's made out of an extremely thin, stretchy knit that is unforgiving and shows everything.  The top is awkward because the gathering near the spaghetti straps pull the neckline up so it sits very high which makes it look very odd.  The legs are very wide but a little short and the elastic across the back seemed to be stitched poorly where the straps are.  I'm not sure what kind of weird contrast they had on the picture in the listing but it really looks as though it's velvet. If you look at the leg in the picture, you can see the black.hanger through it because the fabric is so thin.  This was really disappointing even though I thought it was a bargain."
1.0,"Cheap. Twice bought, twice arrived broken."
1.0,"It was ok. I live in WI and was looking for a winter jacket that was long, light weight and had a hood. This jacket has all that. However there was a weird chemical smell and the fit in the shoulders was weird and the sleeves were too short. The wrist area was looser, which I prefer my coats to be tighter around the wrists. I will be donating this coat to goodwill."
1.0,Didn't like the look of it.  Appeared cheap (to me)
1.0,To small poor material quality
1.0,They broke in a week.
1.0,Piece of garbage. The pin is not compatible with a standard guitar standard. 0 stars if possible.
1.0,I purchased 2 packs (4 pants) and first wear on each pants they ripped! Quality is bad for the price being paid.
1.0,It smells very bad.
1.0,I like the jumpsuit color but I did not get my jumpsuit stay away.
1.0,This is made from very low quality pilling fabric. Very dissappointed.
1.0,Okay but not really what I wanted
1.0,Love the sweater in the photo but it‚Äôs not the same sweater I received.  I ordered black and in this photo it appears to have a marbling if lighter colored thread through it. The one I received is nothing at all the same in color or material to be honest.
1.0,Laughable. The shield doesn‚Äôt stay on a tiny head wiggling around. Was expecting it to be attached with Velcro or something else. It‚Äôs suppose to just be tied around the brim?? Threw it out.
1.0,Broke within hours
1.0,The blouse is shorter than it shows in the picture. It also isn't that well made. The floral pattern on top is a separate piece of material and it's not attached properly. It doesn't lay flat on the solid material. I would not recommend it.
1.0,"I ordered the Carmel colored off the shoulder dress for a New Year‚Äôs Eve event. I am a 6 ft tall woman, size 16 up top and 18 on the bottom usually.  Amazon recommended the size XL for me which also seemed to be my size according to the size chart.  The dress was was a good 4 sizes too small.  I‚Äôd say the XL is a small American size 12.  And that would be a short size 12 - this dress is not for tall girls.  Perhaps I could have gotten away with the top half fit because of the stretch, but the bottom of the dress was closing at all. I was also disappointed with the quality of the fabric - it‚Äôs pretty thin and I imagine that one snag might ruin the fabric. Maybe you could get away with the thin fabric with a good undergarment underneath it, of if you want the dress to look sheer and flimsy.  I know the price is low, but I‚Äôm still very disappointed.  I‚Äôm returning the dress."
1.0,Poor quality not at all a Tiger Woods type product
1.0,Wore them once and bottom started peeling off
1.0,Sizes are not true. Runs small.Order the next size up
1.0,Broke after a few uses. But the company did refund my money really quick.
1.0,Not a well made product.  comes apart to easily and gets runs in it like nylons
1.0,way too thick for a normal watch
1.0,"Cheap material, was expecting better  quality than this. Looks beautiful in the picture"
1.0,I received the wrong item but it had the sticker for the robe I had ordered weird!
1.0,"Unfortunately we purchased this for my brother's wedding and it did not fit at all. There is no stretch to this material, even though we ordered the correct size, not sure if we received one in error."
1.0,Muy mala calidad para el precio.
1.0,Very poorly fitting
1.0,"They're so stiff and have barely any stretch to them. I can barely walk in them let alone work out. I washed them hoping that would loosen them up a bit, now I can't return them. Disappointing and unwearable."
1.0,The material was super cheap.
1.0,"I would not recommend this; bought this since it is her birthstone, but it is really cheaply made, not really worth the price, even though it was pretty cheap anyway"
1.0,"Eso no es piel, eso es un enga√±o, es  piel sintetica."
1.0,Way bigger than a size newborn
1.0,It was a little boys shirt literally would maybe fit a 4 year old boy!!! NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!!!
1.0,"Tight fit where the top of the foot meets the laces, if you have a &#34;thick&#34; foot. This shoe is not for you. Also not wide as other boots or Nike sneakers. Fast shipping & good CS, also it didn't meet the expectations I had when I saw them up close, they look great in the picture."
1.0,"After the first wear, this overall bib ripped. I did a single squat to change a sprinkler head and the inner seam instantly tore. If you need to bend down or move about, I do not recommend this product."
1.0,Material is awful. Took forever to arrive. Fit and fabric are NOT as described. Now I am stuck with this blouse since the seller is not responding to return requests.
1.0,Bought in May and it has broken already. Very disappointed. I was not rough on it nor did it get caught on anything. I was simply loosening it to take it off and boom! Beads everywhere. My daughter will be very upset when she finds out as she and I wear them every day so she can feel close to me when I'm at work. Hers is a different model which seemed more cheaply made to me at the time but I guwss not. Sad day.
1.0,"I am sure I can glue it, but it came in cellophane in a thin mailer, and was broken upon arrival.  Needs better packaging."
1.0,"Terrible, it broke in the first attempt to put in a mask. Very fragile."
1.0,It didn't look like I expected and it wasn't a wrap around dress.
1.0,I ordered these specifically because they said they were a PLUS size XXL. There is nothing plus sized about these pants. I wear a size 16/18 and I'm about 5'8. These didn't even make it up my thigh. It's more like a child's size small.
1.0,Leather tab disintegrated under normal use.  Will be useless in the near future.
1.0,The material is super thin. Not worth the money. Please pass up.
1.0,Arrived with dead battery. Fell apart when attempting to replace battery.
1.0,"I don‚Äôt understand the positive reviews. This short is definitely full of puckers, so much so that unless it‚Äôs ironed it looks like you slept in it. I tried the was and hang suggestions as well as the low dryer and it still ends up looking sloppy. If your looking for that slept in look, or it was balled up on the floor before I wore it look, this is your shirt!"
1.0,Extremely small and some are broken. Size would be okay if you wear multiple earrings and don‚Äôt mind if they are barely seen. Had the pack been 6 bucks I‚Äôd probably keep it and suck it up but for $16 they will be returned.
1.0,Very short and thin material.
1.0,The color is not like the picture. Stays wrinkled
1.0,I would give this no stars! Way to small! Extra large was so small that I ended up giving it to my daughter who's only a size 3 ! I don't recommend anyone buying this junk!
1.0,Not sterling silver as stated. It made her finger turn colors
1.0,Does not look like the picture at all! If you're 5'3 and under this dress is pass knee length. The fabric is really rough. Overall it's not as cute as the pic.
1.0,Cheap quality that fell apart. Wish was better.
1.0,"They are cute, but the tops run 2 to 3 sizes too small. Size up!"
1.0,quality is very bad . it fallen apart
1.0,"It is not 2 bands, it is only one.  Also- I bought this for my husband, who is a normal size guy, and this barely fit around his wrist.  He cannot use, as  it is too tight on the last hole."
1.0,"Was missing a stone when received,quality looks cheaper in person"
1.0,This dress was too long. I am 5‚Äô3 and it landed below my knees. Because of this it was very unflattering. The color is not the same as the photo.
1.0,The material is almost like a thicker swimsuit material. Very unflattering. Went by the size chart. Wasn't even close.
1.0,This shirt is very ugly in person please do not bye
1.0,"It was very disappointed to find out that the feathers on this are real. Most people think that the feathers used in these products are just collected off the ground or something. But that is not the case:<br /><br />Undercover video footage shows employees on goose farms pulling fistfuls of feathers out of live birds, often causing bloody wounds as the animals shriek in terror. The frightened animals are often squeezed upside down between workers‚Äô knees during the painful procedure‚Äîin one instance, an investigator photographed a worker who was sitting on a goose‚Äôs neck in order to prevent her from escaping.<br /><br />Live plucking causes birds considerable pain and distress. Once their feathers are ripped out, many of the birds, paralyzed with fear, are left with gaping wounds‚Äîsome even die as a result of the procedure. Workers often sew the birds‚Äô skin back together without using any anesthetics.<br /><br />That‚Äôs not all‚Äîbuying down can also support the cruelty of the foie gras and meat industries because many farmers who raise birds for food make an extra profit by selling their feathers as well. At the slaughterhouse, many of these birds are improperly stunned, which means that they are still conscious when their throats are cut and they are dumped into the scalding-hot water of the defeathering tank."
1.0,Wore it one time and the skull fell off and I was unable to reattach. Very disappointed):
1.0,EXTREMELY TINY. Picture is deceiving. Can fit only one chapstick in it.
1.0,The extra-large is more like a large
1.0,This is on wish for $2. Looks like toy
1.0,I am not happy at all . These are very tight on the groin area . No room at all to really be comfortable .
1.0,Made horribly and now I am stuck because the return option didn‚Äôt work.
1.0,Belt teeth to hold buckle on barely held the belt together.  With a little force it comes apart.
1.0,Chain broke within a week of receiving necklace...
1.0,When I originally ordered this was listed as  jumpsuit/romper.  Somewhere between me ordering it and me getting it it changed to 2 piece
1.0,It‚Äôs great if you are a small frame person!!!!
1.0,This is just a piece of plastic.  Not representative of the photo at all.  Very disappointed.
1.0,The earrings are junk they was bend when I got them and the backs will not stay on
1.0,Too big and cheaply made.
1.0,"Love these pants, probably the most comfortable I‚Äôve owned. However the material seems to be defective, second time I wore them they spilt at the seam along the pocket. Really a shame."
1.0,The pattern of the hat was cute. The hate look cheaply made and could not be turned inside out because of the different color stitching that did not match the hat at all. I guess you get what you pay for. üôÑ The hat did not look like the hat on the site at all. üò´
1.0,"Love the green color with the stars. However....maybe I don't know what a ""sweatshirt"" is....this is weird fabric that doesn't feel like sweatshirt material. My fault for not reading what the fabric was. Anyway, it feels weird and I'm sending it back. Bummed because it's so cute in the pictures."
1.0,"Raises way to high on the chest, and way to long"
1.0,Quality is bad..
1.0,This is a flimsy rip off imitation. I finally found the real thing at Costco for 1/2 the price! Sturdy and 5x heavier... difference was like night and day!
1.0,"The product was listed as Land's End, long down coat.  It came, was an Amazon Essential all polyester coat.  VERY unhappy.  False description."
1.0,Very disappointed! Arrived in a timely fashion but with a pearl already loose in the package. Lost several more pearls as I wore it the first day. Poorly made and cheap looking.
1.0,This was supposed to be a cute jumper on my 2 year old and it was way too small. It barely went up to her belly button. How am I supposed to tie a jumper around her neck when it barely goes up to her belly button?! I bought size 2-3t which she fits perfect in everything else.
1.0,Good Quality Material
1.0,Bad fit and cheap material
1.0,These jackets do not come with the battery packs
1.0,All 3 shirts had holes in the lace
1.0,"This piece pictured right here is NOTHING compared to what actually is received. I have an exact slim-fit physique and no clothes I have found that says &#34;slim-fit&#34; have dissapoint. Well until now. The fabric is not &#34;rigid&#34; just to call it. I ordered &#34;small&#34; and it still was about a size larger, incredible. You won't like the material if you are expecting an actual blazer to fit over a decent shirt, it wears more like a long-sleeved t-shirt."
1.0,They are not red at all! More orange‚Ä¶
1.0,The color is not what I  ordered! I wished got what I ordered.
1.0,Poorly made. Looks and feels Cheap!
1.0,"I am 4‚Äù11 127lbs and ordered the XS and it‚Äôs huge, fits fine on top and arm but the length is like a foot bigger than me .. the XS fits my boyfriend who is 5‚Äù10 150lbs. Had to return it"
1.0,"I normally wear small... I ordered the medium and it's still way too tight.  Buttons are holding on for dear life in the chest area... And I'm not big in that area in any stretch of the imagination. The material is really bad.  Item came smelling like vomit.  Too bad because it is a very pretty print and looks exactly as pictured . Nice on a hanger, bad on a body."
1.0,"Heavy canvas, looks very sturdy and has an adjustable (and mandatory) shoulder strap.  Two open and one zipper pocket inside. Two snap, two zipper and two open pockets on the outside. This is the perfect size for a &#34;personal items&#34; on most airlines.  I was able to get my MacBook 15&#34; computer, major camera, sunglasses case, inflatable travel pillow set, phone, earbuds and various chargers and still have room left over for lunch.  Bought another one for my husband.  There was a kind of strong rubber-y smell when first unwrapped, but they has gone away after a week of airing out.  The colors aren't vibrant, but about what you'd expect for canvas.  Much better price than comparable items on Amazon.  Haven't traveled yet, but will re-post if there are any problems.  UPDATE: We bought two bags.  The main zipper on mine broke on our first trip, my wife's broke on the second trip.  This would be a great bag if not for the inferior zipper."
1.0,Ordered a size 7/8 received a 3t. Daughter was so disappointed. Great quality outfit though.
1.0,Bought a small. For like a large. Runs extremely big. Quality is also not great.
1.0,Unfortunately I missed the return window. The sweater looks as if it had been worn many times. There are little balls of fabric near the sides of the breast area. Complete rip off. Very disappointed.
1.0,One band was fine the other was the wrong size.  I kept them since I was happy with the one.  How can a 2-pack come with 2 band of different sizes???  Wish I had noticed it before I wore the one that was correct.
1.0,"Very fragile, broke almost instantly, never got a chance to wear it"
1.0,Poor quality and the fit is uncomfortable
1.0,"wowie zowie! a 34 inch inseam on ""tall"" pants!!! gosh you sure have to be a giant! maybe even SIX FEET tall to wear pants THAT long! I'm guessing the company owner is a short round guy who just can't IMAGINE anybody who's lean and tall - We all gotta be short and way overweight!!<br /><br />here's a tip - tall thin guys will pay EXTRA for the experience of pants that fit! I'll pay DOUBLE whatever the short heavy guys pay!<br /><br />wake up to a business opportunity, will you please?? look around and see how many tall thin guys are out there! Duh!"
1.0,Was paper thin & broke the first time it was worn.<br />They refunded me AFTER deducting shipping.  Lame.<br />üëéüëé
1.0,the item is not true to size it runs really small.  The material is shiny and not denim.  It is all one color and not the two color as shown.
1.0,Horrible!! Came ripped.
1.0,"I purchased this item this year, you can no longer tell it's a medical alert bracelet not can you read what it says. When doing anything with my hair it constantly catches and pulls. Seriously dislike this bracelet!"
1.0,"I ordered a size up after reading reviews and looking at the sizing chart. Item was way too small! Could barely get it on. Quality seemed good enough for the purpose of purchase, but it was useless since it didn't fit. Then when I returned it, I was shorted $6. I would just skip buying this item."
1.0,I bought a size up from what I usually wear and it was still too small.
1.0,Description said belt fit 32 to 35 inch waist. The belt was huge. Sending it back.
1.0,Ordered 3xl....it fit my twelve year old 120lb daughter nicely
1.0,"Shirt has a medium sizing in the collar, but it is barely a small."
1.0,"Save your money.  This shrunk so much after one wash that I am now rolling them to make them capris.  I'm only 5'5"" and after one wash, they were well above my ankles from shrinkage.  Cold water wash too.<br /><br />They're great...if you do not wash them."
1.0,The top was the perfect size but the bottom was really really big. I dont really use this item that much.
1.0,This is the worst dress ever..the material is poor...after paying so much for a dress..i was totally disappointed..<br />I contacted the supplier and told them about this..and up to this day nothing was done.<br /><br />After trying on the dress the lace started stretching off and a whitish elastic started showing from the lace...
1.0,"I bought size medium for myself and they were way too small, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 145lb. They are super tight on my daughter who‚Äôs 5‚Äô3 98lb. They would probably fit my 8 y/o better than anyone else."
1.0,"Tried to avoid paying for the higher priced Luminox rubber  watch band and bought a cheaper alternative.  Probably too cheap. Got this product on December 6, 2018 and the band fatigued and broke January 15, 2019.  Only wore the band 5 or 6 times.  Rubber quality is not good."
1.0,Ripped second wear
1.0,Posts are way too short. They wouldn't even go all the way through my 8 yr olds ears.
1.0,Very disappointed in the product.  Advertised as a large and label said large.  Tried it on and could not even button it up as it fit like a medium size shirt.  If you order this type of shirt order a size lager or you will be disappointed in the fit.
1.0,"This piece of crap had to have been made for a small child as it doesn't fit any finger, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  JUNK......."
1.0,After less than a year of occasional wear 80% of the crystals have fallen out.  Very dissapointed. Hoping to be able to return them.
1.0,Cheap product.  Worth less than the price.  Very small fitting.
1.0,I order 3x and it too small
1.0,"Much larger than the Medium I ordered, it was somewhere between a L-XL.  It is also not a tapered cut like the photo would have you believe."
1.0,"I tried... but no thanks. There would be some major bottom boobage... not my idea of a good look! The skirt is somewhat salvageable, but I ordered the set mainly for the top!"
1.0,never got but one
1.0,Doesnt fit well<br />The lower part is smaller than upper part
1.0,"Was a bit yellow, the silicone from this brand  made my ears itch so couldn‚Äôt wear"
1.0,I purchased these for a party and the clasp and the end come right off.  They come apart very easily!  This can be dangerous for little kids!
1.0,Always late otherwise great
1.0,I should of expected this ring not to last. Sadly the black color faded and now its an ugly silver color.
1.0,"The first time I used this bag to fly across country, the zipper broke before I even got off the plane.  Useless and a waste of money, even though I like the size and style"
1.0,Product rolls up
1.0,This is not for curvy girls. i‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and a size 12. got an xl.  I was shocked when i opened the package. It looks like a juniors. shame because its cute. i tried it on for the heck of it.  return!!
1.0,"Bought it a year ago and it is falling apart, the leather is unraveling."
1.0,"Do not buy this item, it's not what the picture shows!!!! It is a tiny  little thing, a decoration, not the full sized umbrella pictured. what a disappointment."
1.0,"The skirt looks nothing like the nice photo! Its cut is more like an A line than a pencil skirt. The cut and the fit makes the material look cheap. There‚Äôs no slit on the back unlike the photo. Bottom line, these are two different skirts. I returned mine."
1.0,"Love it , but the size runs smallüò©"
1.0,Ordered gold and you‚Äôll see doesn‚Äôt match.  Style of shoe is also different than picture.
1.0,Broke after 1 day of wear band fell apart where it connects to actual fit bit.
1.0,Took a long time to arrive and it's not good quality. Would NOT recommend!!! Doesn't look like the photo.
1.0,Tears werent even printed on my crying face emoji
1.0,"1 star for the product, 1 star for the seller BigtimeTeez, 5 stars for Amazon customer service ...<br /><br />The shirt itself is too short.  I ordered a medium and when wearing it, if I lift my arms, it shows stomach.<br /><br />The lettering is very different from the image.  The letters are smaller and they're so faded it's hardly what the image here shows; they are dark, not bright.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and received no reply.  But Amazon's customer service was, as usual, impeccable."
1.0,Not for this price! I'd pay $15-20. The leather is thin. It arrived folded and the creases haven't come out yet. Cute for a $20 bracelet but for $50 I expected more.
1.0,"Horrible fabric, looks like curtain material"
1.0,"I am SOOO disappointed with this dress. I would like a full refund.  The material is like plastic; but the label says NOT to dry-clean the dress, but to iron it.  It was so wrinkled on arrival that it needed ironing.  So I stick my very expensive iron on the dress and INSTANT burning.  The fabric melted straight on to my dress!  I thought my iron was ruined, but I managed to clean it.  The dress, however, is RUINED.  I am truly throwing it into the garbage.  I should have returned it as soon as I opened it when I felt the fabric.  It is SOO cheap.  Won't make this mistake again."
1.0,WAY too small! The sleeves have a band around the edge that is WAY too tight & the sleeves themselves are way too short. The length of the cover up is a lot longer in the picture than it really is. So bummed!
1.0,It‚Äôs blue. Not what I wanted
1.0,Too short to wide made for fat person! Size chart inaccurate
1.0,Instead of an XL it fits like medium size
1.0,They don‚Äôt have stretch around the stitching and the color bleeds bad. They dyed all my clothes blue.
1.0,"Missing any tummy control and they roll up on the legs, making it look like your wearing underwear, verses shorts.  I would not recommend."
1.0,Dress was two sizes too small
1.0,"The material is plastic like, not soft or warm. Wish it was well made because the color scheme is great but it feels so cheap I‚Äôll never wear it"
1.0,Didn‚Äôt like it I wanted to get my refund only got a few cents back sold it to another friend they seemed to like it
1.0,"This shirt is NOTHING like pictured. The fabric is awful, it‚Äôs not comfortable... I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 about 175lbs and the Lg looked like a potato sack.. extremely unflattering. Returned the next day."
1.0,Cons:  very lightweight.  the verticle seam that comes down to the center of the bill was nowhere near centered which made the cap look silly.  Very slopily done.<br /><br />Pros:  At least I didn't lose a lot of money.
1.0,Very cheaply made.  The black material has already shifted of of the steel on the bracelet.
1.0,"I guess its a cool design, but I ended up not really likely the design in the end. Chain broke two seconds after I opened the package. Very cheap. I wouldn't buy again."
1.0,Strange fit/sizing if you Large & up
1.0,Very cheaply made. I understand it's not a real metal/expensive piece but you could at least out both wings on right side up! I'm afraid to try to twist it because it might break!
1.0,Appeared black and made with significantly poor quality. Bent and reshaped at the slightest touch. Completely different than what was advertised. (Different earring in one image to compare color)
1.0,DID NOT FIT!
1.0,This was okay when i received it but after washing the shrug got very small.
1.0,"Okay I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very common for people to come review stuff after it‚Äôs been used for a while, but this pair of pants deserved it. All I do is wear these to work, I take good care of them... BUT THEY SUCK! I have two pairs of the small size, and it‚Äôs a completely different texture and I love them. But the medium is completely different and ALL of the seams are breaking apart and leaving little pieces that look like I have thick gross hair growing out of my pants‚Äô seams. It doesn‚Äôt shave off with a razor, and it just gets worse the more you try to fix it. Not to mention, the crotch area hasn‚Äôt ripped yet, but I can tell it will- or would‚Äôve, if I still wore these pants, rip soon. I was literally embarrassed by the first month and a half or so to wear these to work- they were already my last resort pants. Take my word for it- don‚Äôt waste your money. Also, the picture does not do it justice at all, just saying."
1.0,"Was too small and nerow , I can't wear it even<br />I'm thinking of return it , could you help me to return it?"
1.0,"This is a crew neck cheaply made top, like a nylon sweatshirt. It‚Äôs not designed as an off the shoulder shirt. You can force it off a shoulder but it‚Äôs not slouchy enough to stay off the shoulder. Very disappointed as the print is really cute"
1.0,This is just a tee shirt. The sleeves are not long like the models.
1.0,My child wore them one time in the pool and the seam came apart in one of the toes.
1.0,"I bought this and was very excited based on all the reviews read, but was highly dissapointed when the necklaces I received was different from what was advertised, I have decided to return it. Guess I'll have to shop for a different Christmas gift."
1.0,Looks good from the photos but the quality felt off and it is rather small to store items.
1.0,The product is nice but if your son/grandson is over 10 yrs old this bracelet will not fit him. It's length is for a small child or a female.
1.0,Horrible!<br />Runs way too small.
1.0,This dress should be $5 considering the material that is it made out of. When I first put it on it looked awful not only because it came so wrinkled but for some reason the top part of the lace was super stretched out looking and not elastic at all. The bandeu part that is supposed to cover your chest is not attached at the front so unless you have a larger bust or use a safety pin it will slide down. Will be returning so I can buy a different dress that's not horrible quality for $26
1.0,Loved them till I washed them and now there's a hole in them first wash poorly made.
1.0,Fake shirt. Compared quality with real thrasher shirt. I had to repurchase at a skate shop. Write to me if you don‚Äôt believe so I can show you.
1.0,Looks cheap. Feels cheap. Looks like I would be going to a club.
1.0,My daughter loved these shoes but the sparkle wore off after the first wear. Not a good value for the cost.
1.0,"The ‚ÄúR‚Äù in the word ‚Äúyear‚Äù fell off as soon as I put it on my baby. Other than that, the Cotton is soft and fit well."
1.0,"If you buy this, you better be ready to put some effort into styling this because it looks like a bag!"
1.0,I am super bummed out about this dress. After opening and throwing away the packaging I realized it was much too short to be a dress on me and has a hole dead center in the front. - can I return this item without the original wrapping?
1.0,"Honestly, these pj's were something I was really looking forward to wearing when I bought them. I was excited when I finally got them, only to find that suspicious stain on the pj bottoms.<br /><br />I don't know what it is, but it could be dried blood, and it makes me upset to think someone could have worn these and returned then.<br /><br />It's too bad because they are really soft and seem comfortable."
1.0,"Beautiful earrings, but they were broken"
1.0,"The earrings we received were not what was pictured. The picture shows dangle earrings which was the reason we ordered them. When we received them, they did not have the dangle. It was the snowflakes only. When we looked at the item number on the packing list, it was the exact same item number so it does not appear to be an error. Simply not selling what the picture is showing. Very disappointed."
1.0,"I have purchased JMS panties in size 13 or 14 at Walmart in white only.  They have always fit me nicely..I am a large lady.  This product through Amazon, a 5 pack variety of colors, do not fit, even before washing.  I have the white ones from WM at home that have gone through numerous washings and drying, and they fit me fine.  So, are you selling seconds, or skimping on materials or just plain cheapening this product, because I certainly will not be buying them again."
1.0,"Inexpensive, but also cheap. The coating is bubbled up in several areas. Unless you can get it for about $1.50, don't buy it. It belongs in a Cracker Jack box."
1.0,It‚Äôs cheap and didn‚Äôt work right. These things are a waste of money
1.0,"best bracelets i have had for a 1/2 day!  till they fell apart.  not very well made at all, there was even a cheap office supply-styled staple holding something on it together!  oh well!"
1.0,"definately not like pictured,poor quality was very disapointed"
1.0,I never received this item. However I ordered another pattern as well. The ither coat had very different colors than the picture. Much brighter. Construction and fabric is reasonable for the price point.
1.0,Package was not crushed or damaged in any way. Mask is made from brittle material
1.0,I received it rusted-sent it back. That was a waste of time.
1.0,Yo small for me is size Xl
1.0,Pants are pinstriped.
1.0,not a good quality terrible.
1.0,20 degrees outside and my fingers got cold they did a really bad job making this pair
1.0,This is a free shirt you get when you sign up for a subscription to the magazine . Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,I had high hopes from the other reviews but unfortunately I was sent a used costume. The dress reeked of old perfume and armpit odor. Super disgusting and disappointing. The accessories were also clearly used which is unsanitary especially with Covid. Cannot recommend this at all.
1.0,Not at all what I anticipated. Will box up for miscellaneous/spare christmas present.
1.0,Like but wint stay on stretches out and comes off
1.0,Cheap mess
1.0,Extremely small. Not buying clothes from Amazon anymore. Hideous
1.0,I've bought 4 pair of these two under men's briefs and every pair seems to have little tiny holes to large holes with runs in them already for the price I paid I expected them to last longer
1.0,It only lasted 6 moths :( don't buy!
1.0,It broke within a day of receiving this item
1.0,totally different from picture.
1.0,"Sizing is great. However, this is NOT a bathing suit, it has a snap crotch. It's a BODYSUIT."
1.0,Cheap material! Not worth the buy.
1.0,Very disappointed. I am a big girl and need a 3 x so I had to purchase a mens shirt. Still too small.
1.0,"I wanted to love them because the style is pretty, but my usual size L is too small and the next size up is too large; the waistband has very little give and I feared ripping it trying to get it up over my hips; and the material is itchy. They‚Äôre going back."
1.0,Dimensions and photo in model with given height are either wrong or the product is wrong<br />It's no longer than a shirt<br />I'm 5'3 and it barely covers my crotch area !<br /><br />Biggest waste of money EVER
1.0,Turned green immediately.
1.0,"Not worth it, just spend a few extra dollars and purchase a nice quality wallet."
1.0,Lmao just save your time and don‚Äôt buy. Looks nothing like the photo.
1.0,"This has no give to it at all. Felt like the seams were going to rip putting it on and taking it off, bit fit like a garbage bag when on"
1.0,No me gusto llego diferente ala muestra de la fotograf√≠a
1.0,To be honest it's very cheaply made  i wanted to love this but I actually hate it
1.0,The little lock broke right when I opened it. Weak material.
1.0,"Quality is not the best as it broke, my wife wore this brace for about a month total time. She sometimes used this one vice a less fancy looking straight metal one. but this one broke. I thought I might be able to remove or replace a link but where it broke is not replaceable.  Cheap pot metal casting. would not recommend for high/everyday use."
1.0,This is very cheap and I threw away. Wasted my money.
1.0,Metal is very thin.  Not sturdy.
1.0,"Bad mistake the cost should have let me know better, just wasted material"
1.0,Too small and seller not sending return lable
1.0,I love the makership of these and the presentation. My first pair were too small the second too large. Bummed me. Wish the came in half sizes though I am a straight 9
1.0,Could not even get my glasses into this small holder. What a waste!
1.0,"Was broken and no return policy ,  bad buy"
1.0,The word color was spelled golor.
1.0,"VERY POOR STITCHING, BULKY ON THE SIDES, PATTERN NOT LINE UP, VERY POOR QUALITY. I AM RETURNING THIS PRODUCT!"
1.0,"Very dissapointed, on the photo is all brown but what i received has cream colars and cream colored details everywhere which made it look so cheaply made. The worst part are the buttons are not centered. So bad i hate this. I strongly ""DONT"" recommend this coat, a waste."
1.0,It looks like a child's toy because it is so small.
1.0,It is a 2 piece mask. It doesn‚Äôt look like the picture.
1.0,I got a 3X.The sleeves fit like a 3X but the rest of it fits like a XL üòÇ WASTE OF MONEY!
1.0,These angel wings were very large and would not screw in correctly therefore the angel wings never lined up
1.0,Didn't fit way to small
1.0,Do not waist your money on this decal! Its way too small!!!!
1.0,"tried a pair, they did not hold the earring as stated and one even broke."
1.0,It's sized a bit small.  The fabric chafes.  This was a waste.
1.0,size is no where near accurate
1.0,The clip is weak and doesn't stay on the shirt!
1.0,"after only 3 times of being used the thumb part of the gloves is coming apart and the pu leather is also just coming off of the gloves, only buy if you plan to use very little and dont plan to do much with your hands."
1.0,Very small doesnt fit
1.0,Why not write the truth in the description?  SYNTHETIC FLEECE!  POLYESTER 100%.  Is it really that hard to make a description!  I would never have bought it if I had read this.
1.0,I wear a medium normally so after reading the reviews I ordered a large. It is very small on me. It fits like an extra small. It's a pretty shirt. But It doesn't fit and the material is very thin. You get what you pay for!
1.0,Bag is garbage first time I went to zip it the zipper broke definitely wouldn't recommend this bag to any body ! Bag is garbage!!
1.0,It is to short in length. I am short and it seems like a belly shirt on me.
1.0,"Socks were WAY THIN, not at all what I expected based on the description.  If the description had been clear on that point, I wouldn't have a basis for giving a one-star rating.  But here we are."
1.0,"sorry- I don't like it, feet burn and itch"
1.0,I can't use it because he gaseous smell it has makes me nauseous after a couple minutes. I have soaked it in everything I can think to eliminate the odor. I would not purchase.
1.0,It turned colors after wearing it a few times. Not happy with it.
1.0,Earrings broke in to days  today
1.0,"These are nickel, I had to cut mine off due to so much swelling."
1.0,Lasted one use in a pool. Had holes afterwards.
1.0,"The nipple pasty worked fine, unfortunately, the boob tape ripped off several layers of skin when removed. Despite removal having been done slowly and carefully. Skin was left unsightly,  raw, and painful to touch in those areas. I am hoping the scarring does not last long‚Ä¶I would recommend searching elsewhere for a tape that has good hold but is SKIN SAFE."
1.0,"This bra hurts so much I have to rush home to change, it hurts so much I wish I could just rip it off!!!! Thanks for ruining my 7@$@ing morning, I‚Äôm in so much pain I could cry, I‚Äôm 34d and I ordered a large by the way because that‚Äôs the size I always order in sport bras"
1.0,"Its a cheap watch that only fits a huge persons wrist. Plus, the bog bulge on the timepeice part doesnt really blend in with the rest of the watch."
1.0,"First and foremost this product listing says 3-5 hr your lucky if you get 2 hours out of it , after multiple times reaching out to the seller they give me the general information that‚Äôs on the product description the finally says why it‚Äôs working as intended ... The mask itself is super thick and because of the multiple layers it actually looks fuzzy on the led screen it self I found you have to pin it back to make sure the screen look good ... nothing but a waste of money if I‚Äôm being honest you will get customer service at the local fair and probably a longer battery with one of those make"
1.0,Ordered largest size available but dress was tiny. Had to give away üôÅ<br />Took several weeks to be delivered as well.
1.0,These doesn't look like the picture.  I sent them back
1.0,Looks absolutely nothing like the picture. Doesn‚Äôt fit that way. Doesn‚Äôt see it that way. I don‚Äôt think that even sizing up would give it that oversize off the shoulder look. Will be returning
1.0,Pretty cheap stuff. Don't do the job well unfortunately. Go check another brand.
1.0,Prongs started prying apart and I lost gems during the first day of wear.
1.0,"Avid lingerie shopper here . I went against the negative reviews & ordered it anyways being that I‚Äôm super petite in the chest area . Oh god it‚Äôs horrible lol . The sleeves are barely stitched on, once you have your arms in there is no way you are tying the back corset . Also let‚Äôs talk about how the photo shows the matching gstring but it does NOT come with it . Returning asap."
1.0,I liked it but it unhooks very easily and the color fades.
1.0,Paid $10.99 and it didn't include the strap!  Luckily had a strap from another purse that I could use for a concert with a clear bag policy.  No time to return and get a new one.
1.0,The entire shoe sole is in skulls and a skull in the back of the shoe. They went right back. Pathetic!
1.0,"Not a very nice quality, poor cheap fabric."
1.0,Smelled like gasoline. Couldn't get the smell out.
1.0,I was under the assumption that all 110 pieces would be black but I was wrong.  Only 25 pieces were actually black!  Very dissatisfied!
1.0,Color tone more orange not yellow gold.
1.0,"UUHHH, THEY ARE NOT BLACK, THEY ARE NOT BLACK  !!!!<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I  WAS EXPECTING  !!!!<br /><br />I'M NOT HAPPY AT ALL."
1.0,"The fabric is cheap, it has no shape to it. Save your money and wear a 30 gallon trash bag instead. It‚Äôll be the same result."
1.0,"The hard plastic surrounding the lenses pinches much too close together behind the hinge and bites painfully into the bridge of my nose.  It's too bad, because otherwise they seem quite nice.  They might be fine for a wide, relatively flat face, but for my narrow and moderately angular face they are completely unusable."
1.0,This product is too small for an adult costume. The apron barely fits and the accessories are too look small on. As soon as I took out the duster a feather fell out. Poor quality
1.0,"I do love the style, the pattern and that it's a cream color and not completely bright white but I thought it was a a mid thigh high it reaches just above my knees and that's if I really pull them up which I really really don't like they're also very uncomfortable and too tight above the knee. I usually read comments to make sure of this but i really liked the style so I took a chance. The material is not very nice either a little bit rough for my liking and its also a little too thin as the socks stretch you can kind of see through it. I weigh 130 and I'm 5'3 I'm not too thick I'm very average so it's definitely the socks them selves either way thigh highs are always nicer with a softer stretchy material that you can always throw on these socks in particular are very uncomfortable and unattractive. I have attached a photo the lighting is very bad in my room but in the photo you can see how ugly they look as they dent in tightly above my knee."
1.0,Broke after 1 week. Now I can't wear it and I'm out the money.
1.0,Only used two times and back seam separated. Plastic is too thin. Product is not durable.
1.0,"Complete rip off.  Worked 5-6 weeks.  Replaced both batteries and guess what?<br />You get what you pay for, that's right. Can I give  1/4 star?"
1.0,Looks like a clown costume. Not cute at all.
1.0,"Pretty style, look great but poor quality. The plating came off within a week causing irritation. They are now useless."
1.0,Works well one month then right shoe won't light up<br />Bought twice problem with same shoe<br />First one full return next one I just did a review and contacted seller waiting on response<br />Son was very upset he was so excited for his shoes but well this happened
1.0,"The necklace arrived damaged - the charm was falling off the chain.  But, the item is also very, very cheaply made - bubbles in the &#34;silver&#34; coating, a cheap bright green &#34;gem&#34; at the top - glued in askew, and the cheap chain very likely wouldn't have withstood even a few wears.<br /><br />Thank you for the prompt refund."
1.0,Love the earrings themself. Good quality and look nice. Problem is I can't get them in my ear. Even had 2 other people try to help. No luck! They are so small and the post has so much curve on it. Sad but I'll have to return.
1.0,metal is very thin.  not srong
1.0,Very nice looking watch however I put the time on it and a couple hrs later when I‚Äôd check on it was completely wrong yet it was still ticking. Tried it several times and continued doing it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it‚Äôs not trusted time. Possibly I got a defective one idk but very disappointing. Bought it for a cruise since my phone battery is awful I wanted a watch for the time and this never worked for me. Never matched the actual time minutes after readjusting every time.
1.0,"Descriprio says it is cotton in the title for this mask, however it is actually polyester. Image is printed all the way to edges, so it is distorted when you fit the mask onto your face. Still recognizable as California flag though."
1.0,"It was too larger than I thought. I was so disappointed with this product. The quality was not what I expected. I order m at first but was too big,  I have to return it and or small but still poorly designed. I'm not order from them again.  I should give them F grading."
1.0,Comfortable. But ripped when I tried to put it on!
1.0,This product is not as seen on Amazon it has  Absolutely no material hanging.  The product they said it won't even droop on that very petite young lady. It is POORLY MADE. I Do Not Recommend this product.  It gets No Stars!!!! but I HAD TO SELECT A STAR TO INFORM YOU'LL.  SO REMEMBER NO STARS!!!!!!
1.0,No es piedra de verdad
1.0,doesnt lay so nicely on the ear and the closure is really not secure!
1.0,I have had this purse for 5 days now.  When I opened it up it smelled like something died in it.  I have aired it out for days and sprayed air freshner in it several times and it still smells.  It is a cute purse
1.0,will be returning this top because it makes my girls look 3 times as big.  Not flattering at all!
1.0,Too small!!  Literally couldn‚Äôt connect the strap. Made for a boy or woman‚Äôs wrist.
1.0,"This is the second one and this onbroke within a month, days after the return policy. Breaks on the piece of plastic that swivels to change colors (which I didn't even use). Everything else was great and metal, horrible design to make a critical piece so weak. Can't even get a refund on them."
1.0,"Nothing like the pic, and the weird pointy hem is terrible"
1.0,"Hace 1 mes ped√≠ esta falda y ahora dicen ,el producto se ah perdido ,,no me dan raz√≥n como pueden hacerme un reembolso ,, necesito mi dinero para atr√°s"
1.0,"I have two pairs of these and they seemed good at first, fit well. But the strap on the first pair broke after a few weeks and so I bought a second pair to give them another try because you know, kids. But on the second day, only the second time wearing them, the strap broke. And no theyre not too small or anything like that."
1.0,"The fabric was extremely thin. I plan to return.<br /><br />The style and fit were great, but the material is much too shear--paper thin."
1.0,"Not happy at all made my boobs look like a uniboob i don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs a real word, didn‚Äôt hold anything and my boobs were all over the place."
1.0,"Admittedly, I didn't take a close look on my phone at the sock before ordering but it is unfortunately as it's pictured. We were wrapping gifts and we were both said what does that say? HOLL ----?<br />I know I ordered the Hallmark socks and thought they must be a mistake or defective since that is the most important word. Went online, zoomed in and that's the way they looked. My bad. I'm giving them 1 star because they were very inexpensive and wearable but just can't givng them as a ""I'm watching Hallmark"" gift unless the recipient had way too much wine and could decipher it."
1.0,Sizes run way to small.  Had to return.
1.0,Size .
1.0,It's cute but broke right away
1.0,These are not a typical stretchy swim suit material. Not sure what they are or what you would use them for.
1.0,Received swimming trunks instead of a flag
1.0,"Product arrived with split seams ,returned and refunded"
1.0,Runs small around the hips and is too short for a dress. The company tried to send me a new one and it was even tighter than the last one they shipped
1.0,"Will be returning. The velvet is very cheap and the dress is very large. I got a small. 5'2, 120lbs"
1.0,Pesimo producto la tela super mala.
1.0,Just didn't fit like the image or the measurements. Felt like the fabric would rip pretty easily. Didn't even wear once.
1.0,Too thick to wear living in coastal sc. If you stay cold you could use..I can't
1.0,The dress looks gorgeous in the pictures. Its cheaply made. Thin material. Pajama like material. Very disappointed as I wanted to wear this in the 4th of July parade
1.0,Did not fit at all- size didn't match at all! I ordered a 16/18 and it was more like a 3x!! Not true to size!!!!
1.0,These pants had no stretch. Not comfortable at all.
1.0,2 of 3 were broken. Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,"These earrings looked nothing like the pretty picture of brillant emeralds. The wire looked like brass with no electro plate gold and the ""emeralds"" looked like large ,green bulky rocks. I returned it and got my refund right away.  I do not recommend."
1.0,Disliked that it took a month to get. And size was HUGE
1.0,Way to small got the 3xl it fits like a med an it cost more to send it back than it's worth so will not ever buy from them again
1.0,After only a few months the belt buckle broke. What a waste of money
1.0,I purchased many cheap rings from Amazon this one was the most expensive and is garbage
1.0,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù 200 pounds. Kinda lengthy. A large (which I usually buy, fit me like an extra small)"
1.0,I bought 2 of them and they both broke after wearing about a week!<br />Can I get my money back or send me two more?!
1.0,"I would have left a 3 or 4 star rating due to an issue I had but the one thing I hate most is poor customer service.<br /><br />We received the outfit and although I thought quality was poor my wife loved the way our son looked in it.  The one issue we had was that the hat was too small.  So small it fit our 6 month old perfect (we bought a 3T).<br />I contacted them and told them that I believe they sent me a wrong size hat.  They told me that's impossible.  I told them OK, maybe this hat is defective and I'd like to exchange it.  They said fine but all the hats are identical so I would basically get the same hat back.  I told them that it made no sense that it would fit my 6month baby perfectly and too small for my son that isn't even 3 yet.  They told me that they've sold thousands and no one has ever complained of the hat size.<br />Maybe I'm wrong.  You be the judge. See the pics."
1.0,No le quedaron ..tienen algo que estorba que no se pueden usar
1.0,"Very stiff, I received a cuff like this a few years back and I‚Äôm replacing it. This one is not mailable at all, very durable but not comfortable."
1.0,watch wasn't working when I received it. Bought a new battery for the watch and it still doesn't work. Not a good purchase
1.0,Had 1.5 months and the zipper just broke. Was worn maybe 4 times.  He loved the sweatshirt but cheaply made. Of course outside the return window.
1.0,"Runs very small, cloth quality wasn‚Äôt good and the stiching was off in many places. Had to return it back obviously!"
1.0,AWFUL. It was completely see through even when I put on light pink undergarments to try and match the dress. I returned it.
1.0,Everything was perfect about the dress except the color was not what was shown in the picture was very disappointed
1.0,That they are very small pebbles. Not what I was looking for
1.0,This dress is unwearable unless you are wearing something under. The V neck is so deep it nearly goes to my belly button.
1.0,Stiff as a board and not long enough to wrap around your head.
1.0,"I really like the concept of a light weight metal card case that displays the cards so clearly.  However, the clasp is so flimsy that within a very short time the clasp breaks and the case is gone.  I have used it for about 6 weeks and it is broken."
1.0,"I purchased these boots for my 6 and 8 yr old granddaughters for Christmas gift. They did not last a month before they started peeling at the toes and the so,e and ties area came apart. Had to throw them in the trash. Save your money. Will never purchase again. Stated they were leather but that was false."
1.0,Nothing like advertisement
1.0,Don‚Äôt waste your money on these because they break easily unfortunately.
1.0,Didn't  like the fabric.
1.0,"I had to go buy something else.  The face of the locket was scratched and no wonder the small box it was in had no protection so during shipping or before the face of the locket was scratched.  For the price not going to return, my granddaughter did like the rosary inside.  For future reference please put some protective cotton in the box."
1.0,It's very heavy and has no cushion on the skin side. Buy a different one.
1.0,"Well, the pants were very pretty, I liked the colors/pattern and the fabric feels nice but the seems on the inner thigh ripped within an hour of wearing them!! So disappointing...."
1.0,Thought it was gonna be long and wide enough for it to be hijab wear but it‚Äôs great for underscarf
1.0,"One of my favorite bras is a Danskin Now Seamless Sports Bra. It's in XL. That's what ALL my bras are. XL.<br /><br />These two bras are much much much smaller than XL. (I'd guess they're more like MEDIUM...) Very difficult to get on and pull down. They come with major padding (thankfully it's removable) I didn't want, but I was trying to buy a Danskin NOW sport bra because my other is such a spectacular bra.<br /><br />These seem well made enough, but IMO, the sizing is way way off. Too bad... I always tried to buy Danskin due to quality."
1.0,Not to happy
1.0,"WEIRDLY small!<br />While normally I‚Äôd chalk it up to being a big gal, the issue wasn‚Äôt that it didn‚Äôt go over my head (it did), but rather it, hung like a (very) heavy necklace with barely enough space between the epaulets to sit on my shoulders.<br />So I‚Äôll echo another comments sentiments about how this is best for the ultra petite, but specifically for people with a very, VERY narrow chest & shoulders.<br />Anyway, I bought this to wear over my wedding dress and I‚Äôm pretty bummed to have to return it."
1.0,I got this jacket for my daughter and loved it so I ordered in M. A totally different style jacket arrived. I am returning and hoping when I re-order I get this specific one but it's a great jacket
1.0,I ordered these because I thought they look so cute but unfortunately there 2 sizes too small
1.0,"I purchased a XXXL. Thinking it would be a bit big on me, instead it‚Äôs about the size of a typical XL."
1.0,"Material is very thin, not as pictured"
1.0,These run very very small and the fabric is not great
1.0,"The dropdown size selection says XL/US-L. This is NOT true. The actual size chart says XL is a US size 8. That is the smaller side of a US Medium. When I tried it on, I first thought it was a child's XL!!!!!!!! WAY too small. Returning!"
1.0,Top fit but bottom too big
1.0,"Absolutely very bad product. They just stuck all these stupid size stickers on them. The shoes only good part was they are super lightweight. However, every thing else about them was horrible. They are crooked, and the labels are glued on crooked."
1.0,"These boxers were very inexpensive in bulk, now I know why. The pattern is cut for the crotch to hang about 3-4 inches below where it should. If you pull them up to where the crotch fits, you have a very short boxer and the waist band is near your armpits. It really makes one wonder. Are these seconds? Designed for another species? I don't know, but they are going back as a return."
1.0,I liked the style but it was way too small and the material was a little cheap for the price.
1.0,The flare on these is HUGE. There‚Äôs no way to get them in your ear if you order the correct size. I‚Äôm a 0g so I‚Äôm not able to order a size down :(
1.0,So disappointed it was very cute...
1.0,These are so stretchy and soft gluing pads on would be more useful. The pads are oddly thick but the bra itself is less supportive than nylon stockings. Just wear body paint or glue pads on instead.
1.0,Not what I expected. Not a leather flip flop as described.  Uncomfortable the size is correct but overall fit is tight.
1.0,"This watch band is rose gold & is pictured as pink, I reached out to the seller & they blew me off telling me that this band is pink which is incorrect!! They offered me a discount & I didn‚Äôt take it because I was going to return it & forgot to return it & now the return window is closed, it is comfortable & appears to be durable but the color description is extremely misleading‚Ä¶..the all clear one maybe a better choice"
1.0,I found the glasses too narrow for me.  My hat size is 6 7/8&#34;.  The description should have some reference as to it's size.
1.0,Another cheaply made product from china<br />Clasp in the back will definitely wear out fast<br />They don't show that on the ad<br />Material is of but u get what u paid for<br />I can buy this hat at any flea market for 5 bucks
1.0,After the 1st time u wear it is pretty much a Dred lock waste just a waste...<br />It is cute tho n the color is a little of its not pink it's a salmon color
1.0,Horrible I paid $15 for this one balloon and it arrived with a hole in it
1.0,Red Moose is far superior. This one didn‚Äôt provide a shine and was dry and cracked when I opened it.
1.0,Broke after using for about 20 minutes. Sliders quit.
1.0,I wanted to love these. The face is too heavy and they slide out your ears. You can't bend it too much in fear of breaking them. I wish they came with a back
1.0,"First, these rings do NOT come in different sizes. I bought the largest option so that I could wear it on my middle finger, but it barely fits on my pinky. Second, one of the rings broke within 2 minutes of me opening the package. I strongly suspect I could make a better armillary sphere ring by myself out of aluminum foil‚Äîdo not waste your money here."
1.0,First day wearing them and the stitches are coming out of the moto ribs and after a few hours the button popped off and they're not even tight around the waist.
1.0,"Cheap plastic material,  too small, had a horrible odor. I returned it."
1.0,"Band seems to be nice but nice but once attached to the watch it is very difficult to remove. It defeated the purpose of having several bands. I had to rip it off very carefully to remove it.  Seller offered me a new band to try but it never arrived. He just didn't want me to leave a bad review but truth being told the item is a piece of cheap chinese trash. I just can't comprehend why there are some manufacturers that don't care about wasting Earth's resources, their time and money, my time and money. Don't buy this tras. You'll regret it."
1.0,Pure trash. I tried putting one on after another and it they just snap in half as soon as you try to adjust it so now I am stuck with useless items
1.0,Just not a flattering top.
1.0,NOT LIKE PICTURE  SKIRT MUCH LESS MATERIAL THAN SHOWN  NO THE SAME COLOR  NOPE
1.0,Not for large chested women.  Did not stay up.  Asked for a return and nothing.  Very mad about this purchase.
1.0,way 2 small
1.0,Piece of crap broke after 2 days.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,My neices Never got to use it. The hook/clamp broke while putting it on for the first time. Two little girls were very disappointed
1.0,"Fraud. The product show the socks up over the knee. These socks do not stand up over the knee even when standing still. These socks are not as advertised or I was sent a pair of no quality checked, defective socks."
1.0,"This shirt, isn't even the same shirt that is in the picture. That shirt is clearly some sort of chiffon and this one is polyester. It is not very well-made, and the elastic around the top is too tight, making it almost impossible to wear off the shoulder. The print isn't quite the same either. But very similar."
1.0,Cosmetically beautiful but broke within less than 1 week. Returned.
1.0,"I REALLY LIKED THIS A FIRST, THEN TE FRINGE STARTED UNRAVELLING. IT WAS MADE VERY CHEAPLY. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND BUYING TYHIS PRODUCT."
1.0,It is a very long top
1.0,I bought what was supposed to be a toddler size 11 and what I received fits like a toddler 9. They were way too small.
1.0,"At first, I was very happy with this purchase. It seemed and looked waterproof. I go to a college that gets a good amount of rain that is usually cold. So, with an umbrella, this kept me dry. Or so I thought. Since I would also use an umbrella, I usually only got water on the bottom part which doesn't really hug my body. Today, my friend and I were walking back from the dining hall and it was raining, so I let him use my umbrella since I had this jacket. On the brief 1/4 mile walk to my dorm, I noticed that I felt something wet on my back and head. But I thought it was maybe perhaps that the water was just cold. But in reality, the jacket did not keep the water out and instead leaked onto the clothes I was wearing. I am very disappointed. If you use an umbrella with this jacket, then it works fine. But if you are looking for something that is actually waterproof, then I do not recommend this product."
1.0,"This outfit is hideous not flattering at all, cheap material<br />I immediately returned the item"
1.0,I was expecting it to be full and sit out like the photo and it did not. Its just drapes . I didn't like that.
1.0,"Ordered sizes in XL . Glasses very small, had to give them to my 10 year old."
1.0,Terrible quality and horrendous fit. I highly suggest skipping this item.
1.0,"These have no compression at all, so they show everything! Had to return"
1.0,i just used it 4 times and now it doesnt work. pressure doesn't come out or heat and its completely unuseful.
1.0,They don't stay fastened.
1.0,They lucky I even gave them a star. That fake gold almost messed up my both my ears. Both my ear reacted but only one got  keloid and messed up my sizing. STAY AWAY FROM THE FAKE GOLD
1.0,"Cheap, do not hold up tight, no good...I prefer the Zensah brand for for quality, price, and durability.  I use them daily to cover my tattoos at work"
1.0,The light on the watch is defective and of no use. No wonder the price is so good. Do not wish to go through the troubke un returning/
1.0,did not looklike photo
1.0,Ripped after first wear. Horrible.
1.0,"This was a gift, she put it on and it broke within a minute of wearing"
1.0,DO NOT BUY!  This company is under Investigation by Amazon. I asked many different questions got this response please be patient. I asked I will pay them to alter boots. I got please be patient. The ankle to knee is HUGE I can gather more than an inch of material. To get it close to my calf. Save your sanity. Don't buy.
1.0,The print was place incorrectly so I returned it
1.0,Terrible zipper broke
1.0,I have another pair I love but this pair immediately broke in my purse despite it being in its bag and very little in the bag. $50 out the window.
1.0,These shoes look like they're well made and they look cool enough...but these size 12s are smaller than the 11 1/2s they were meant to replace for my 5 year old grandson.  I'm returning them.
1.0,The ring is not smooth it has sharp edges and it is sized incorrectly. Waited to long to return it and now it will catch dust in my jewelry box
1.0,I would not buy from this seller again. The band was extremely stiff and would not lay flat on my wrist. I went to return the item and was going to have to pay to ship it back. It is not worth returning.
1.0,"i want to love these, i love the shape but they sit VERY crooked on my face and their design wont allow me to shape them"
1.0,If I could give it no stars I would looks. O thing like the picture. Basically a rough Hanes t shirt not good material at all looks soft and flows in the photo. Someone just took a pair of scissors and cut slits all over. Not happy I have now spent $13 for a shirt to sleep in also I usually wear l/xl and I ordered a xxxl so it was baggy....it was not! The &#34;choker&#34; band lays acrossed my chest no where near my neck don't waste your $
1.0,"Do not waste your money! Arrived with a dead battery which I begrudgingly replaced.<br />After 2 weeks of wearing, the plastic round rim fell off. Very cheaply made."
1.0,Trashy and the opposite of liberty.
1.0,"Poorly made and extremely cheap feeling, these are $5 glasses at most."
1.0,The gold one broke on arrival and that was the only one I really wanted.
1.0,Disliked everything about it. Doesnt feel good and is very cheap. Horrible quality
1.0,Sizes are nowhere near true. Thin poor quality and WAY overpriced. Will not order again
1.0,Beautiful necklace it broke within the first hour that I had it
1.0,Will be returning. The bows aren't so much bows as something half resembling bows. Even trying to pull out the other side. They are sewn only on one side and so the fabric won't look the same on each side
1.0,This only looks nice for a short while. Turn the colors and looks like junk now.
1.0,This is latex but said thermoplastic
1.0,I thought i was buying 2 glasses and only got one plain one<br />AWFUL
1.0,"Save your money, they noted the wrong size and these are WAY too small."
1.0,One of the earrings broke the 2nd day my wife wore them
1.0,Adjustable piece very uncomfortable and doesn't grip pant legs well.
1.0,these arrived and were so big I couldn't even put them on. they were big enough to fit my room mate and she didn't even want them because they were made with a weird fabric. not itchy but also did not feel like jeans
1.0,Very thin and cheaply made Chinese product.
1.0,"The fabric is extreamly thick, feels bulky."
1.0,Nothing like I expected!
1.0,"I read the directions very carefully that the sizes given were Chinese and not US sizes, so I was very careful to refer to the provided sizing chart to determine what size I would need. To be on the safe size, I ordered a size 2X which is the equivalent of US 18/20 according to the sizing chart the seller provided with the listing. I don't normally wear this large of a size, but I figured better to be safe than sorry and I'm ok with a winter coat fitting a little big. To my total disappointment, this coat was way, waaaaaaaaay beyond off in size, and I'm talking about the sizing chart provided by the seller. When I put this coat on, that the seller called a plus size, it was honestly like trying to put on a child's coat. That's truly no exaggeration. My 15-year-old daughter who weighs 100 lbs and wears a woman's size extra small fits in this plus size size 2X like a glove. Their size small must be made for an infant and I'm not even joking! When I requested a return because of their extreme sizing errors and discrepancies, I was told I would have to pay return shipping of $10-$12....or I could get a menial $8 off and try to resell it myself or give it away. What a joke! Why should I have to be out of pocket because they have their merchandise mislabeled? I will be adding pictures of myself and my daughter wearing what the seller calls a size 2X plus size coat."
1.0,Very cute bathing suit but it arrived with one strap missing a clasp.  You get what you pay for I guess.  Took several weeks too receive so I'm not even going to try and return it.  Don't buy this if you want quality
1.0,"I bought these for Kundalini yoga. When they arrived I tried them on and they fit well  - nice and loose, perfect for yoga. (I am 5'7"" and about 130 pounds). I washed them on delicate and hung to dry (I always wash new clothes before wearing them) then hung in my closet. I went to put them on tonight and they seemed too big around the waist. I took them off and that was when I noticed what looked like a thin elastic band had broken and was ""swimming"" inside the waist band (not sure how else to describe it). I got online and I missed the return date by two days! I don't think it is worth taking to a seamstress because they were so inexpensive. I suppose you get what you pay for?"
1.0,I got XL but the bra cup is toooo small. It would fit cup A or B top. The skirt was ok for someone who were L but it is ok for me.
1.0,"Was very upset, my earrings started to change color, when I cleaned them."
1.0,"These shorts are very uncomfortable and scratchy, poorly made and very tight on me even though I am small and I bought the large size. I prefer to spend more money and get shorts that are well-made and comfy."
1.0,Waaaaaayyyyyyy tooo small! Buy it two size above
1.0,"I loved the color! However,  the fit of pants was completely off."
1.0,We were fans BUT now they aren't worth the time it takes to order.  I ordered 2 at a time as my mother lost them.  The last 2 wouldn't hold the correct time for a day.  I put them upside down in the window.  Then I set the time manually.  It didn't hold the time.  Very disappionted.  Customer service is NO help.
1.0,"Ordered this dress for a wedding as it had great reviews, was long and elegant. However I am sad to say that the dress I ordered was not the dress I received. (See pictures) the dress I received was the correct size I ordered however it short and sleeveless. And a dirrent design, order with sufficient time to return/replace ‚Äújust in case‚Äù."
1.0,Stinks like gas.

1.0,"Very sheer, runs very small"
1.0,They have all broken at the cuff....poor quality.
1.0,I ordered the Black Butler Sebastian Seal necklace as a gift for my daughter and instead received a Star Trek necklace. VERY disappointing especially since this seems to have happened to many customers.
1.0,"Tested this product and it does nothing to your EMF levels. Complete fake, if you are getting benefits.<br /><br />I don't know if shungite itself is all a hoax made up by Russia or this specific shungite is fake. It's either one or the other."
1.0,Clasp pin brokin
1.0,Picture and description had a hoodie with a front pocket. I received a plain sweatshirt....no hood....no front pocket.
1.0,In order to fit into this dress I would have to of ordered two sizes larger.
1.0,"Although they seems to be cute and quality material, the The part where you tight them broke after one week and now useless."
1.0,The sizing was off by 2 sizes
1.0,"very thin fabric, and looked cheap"
1.0,I forgot to write this and return these but my pants split right down the seam.  No reason for this as it's on the leg just above the knee
1.0,The size did not seem to be accurate to 1 ct.
1.0,Frame on both pair broke in the same spot after 1 day. Unsure of cause but the only thing I can think of is that they are such poor quality that they couldn't handle the forces applied during cleaning them.
1.0,"We ordered these, the size small. It is sized 10 -11, NOT the larger size advertised."
1.0,"Completely plastic feel, uber cheap sunglasses"
1.0,What a joke.  It was super small.  There is no way it was what I saw on line.  It is a big pain to send it back too so there is that.
1.0,"I bought these glasses a year ago and they've been fantastic. 13 months after purchase, one of the screws broke off in the frame and cannot be fixed at an eyeglass store. I've now written to Soxick 3 times to ask about the lifetime guarantee, but have not received any response. I'm very disappointed in the customer service."
1.0,Sending it back ! Doesn‚Äôt resemble the picture on the model at all. Looks like a hospital gown.
1.0,Have bought similar ones before that I really liked but these are the worse! The elastic on the waist is really tight and has no stretch to it. Super uncomfortable! Wish I could return these!
1.0,Esto no me lo han entregado. Y dice que lo entregaron ayer y a mi no fue
1.0,It did not state what the material was. It's  thick lined polyester. Not what I expected. Color is very vibrant not muted as in the picture.
1.0,The metal teeth of the clasp frayed the belt on the first day
1.0,It smell bad when I got this
1.0,"I received this in a soft folder package. When I opened it up the butterfly was bent up so much it was unusable. It's made from thin cardboard, so the folds had made lines across the color."
1.0,Broke as soon as I picked it up.
1.0,For me its completely useless.  This is not even good for kids.  I bought this by looking at the picture.  Its not ultra stretch and not fit to all sizes.  I wasted my money.
1.0,"This is not a bra for larger breasts. Honestly i can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs any better for any size breasts. . My shoulders killed me after DRIVING for 6 hours. I did nothing but drive. Nothing that should have made the bra kill my neck and shoulders, but kill them it did. This thing made me feel like i had a flipping injury. Please do NOT Waste your money!"
1.0,I wore this once for an entire day.  I don't have oily skin but when I took it off the inside of the chain had tarnished on the part that was against my forehead.  Definite junk and waste of money for only being able to wear it once.  I don't recommend unless you plan to throw it out after one use.
1.0,The blouses wasn't made for big size brought the biggest size an yet as a size 14 it wouldn't come cross my bust an was very dispointed  because they're nice blouses but even with your xxxxl no fit so please don't cut  the material so skimy make some blouse for PLUS SIZES.
1.0,Liked style dislikes band broke
1.0,Awful knockoff. The khaki color as stated in the description is not what I received. It was a nasty ugly mustard color. Also the fit in the picture is the same fit down the torso. Well the fit of this one was loose and baggy in the middle of the torso but incredibly tight fitting at the bottom of the shirt. Also the sleeves were way to short even though I‚Äôm incredibly short armed.
1.0,"Item pictured is NOT the item you will receive!<br />- This top is completely sheer, and from the photos you are lead to believe it is at least somewhat opaque. This is nothing but lace, completely see through. I expected it to at least be lined, maybe not in the most high quality black fabric, but something so that you cannot see every little pore and hair and freckle, but at least a fabric lining to add some opacity. Nothing of the sort, not at all like pictured. There is no lining of any sort, it is just simple lace, nothing else.<br />- Top does not have gap between panels on the sternum as pictured, the two lace panels are actually touching. In the photos it looks to have almost a 3cm gap between them. This is the design element I was purchasing this top for."
1.0,It's too tight I'm at work hat is not available
1.0,Bought multiple pairs of these shorts in different colors. They are true to size and fit well but this pair ripped after only wearing twice. The rip isn't even the see. I can't return them and have to trash them.<br />Too bad because I really liked them. I hope it doesn't happen with the other pairs.
1.0,I received this product but it did not come with a drawstring so they just fall down so they‚Äôre completely useless it was for a birthday present for my mom and I was so embarrassed that I had nothing to give her. I would like a replacement or a refund please and I will send these back
1.0,First one fit. The next 2  were super small.  Crazy sizes ? I was out of town and stuck.
1.0,"These leggings are NOT fleece lined. Don't get fooled, they are lying on purpose. These are totally normal leggings WITHOUT A TRACE OF FLEECE."
1.0,Packaging was partially open already with the parcel packaging. 2 of 4 shot glasses missing and the 2 remaining were broken already.
1.0,Product arrived without pins which are not standard. Unable to use product.
1.0,"I WOULD NEVER wear these without leggings underneath. I wish the seller would realize that these are almost unwearable. I paid with my own money to buy these, so you can believe that this is a real review. I hate when people do this. Why do you  have to lie in your reviews?<br /><br />The length and the sizing is workable, just wear wedges and they will be off the floor. The most deceiving part is the sheerness of the material. I do not recommend at all. Not only are they sheer, but they get so wrinkly and would look like PJ's after wearing them for a while sitting down. I wore these on a Sunday to church, we went out to lunch after, I was embarrassed when I checked myself in the mirror. If the material is of better quality, this would be worth it.<br /><br />20 dollars for this quality is a rip off.<br /><br />I am 5'2"", 160ish lbs, bought a Large. The pants are on the floor as you can see. However if I bought a medium they would be too tight and would not look like they do on the model."
1.0,Pedido incompleto
1.0,The item is described as a two piece suit. It‚Äôs only the jacket that shipped.
1.0,These weights look like what I need but the delivery time of 5 to 7 weeks is too long for my needs.
1.0,"Cheap, gaudy, ugly, and not even the pattern or color I actually ordered."
1.0,i did not like the glasses they are very light and made of cheap material that is easy breakable. Mine are broken already and I had them for less then a week.
1.0,"The first one was ripped, threads flayed everywhere, but I bit my tongue and tried the others, and they worked, were not water resistant, and a few days later each apron flayed out, pockets fell off, RIPP-OFF, will not buy again"
1.0,They broke... in under 10 minutes. Total garbage.
1.0,Its a Good Shirt but i Ordered a blue and gray one and I good a gray one‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è. Please explain this
1.0,"It is well constructed. It just looked awful on me. I'll stick with my racerback speedo. I took the sizing and reviews into consideration, and I think I ordered it too big. It fits. It just doesn't fit like a swimsuit. Too loose. I take partial responsibility for the sizing, but it's just not an attractive swimsuit. Just my two cents."
1.0,"Was beautiful when I received it. Within just a few weeks, the stones started falling out. At least 3/4 are gone and this is no longer wearable."
1.0,"Mildew, the garment reeked I had to return"
1.0,"The dress was pretty cute, but poorly made. The lace material shrunk up about two inches above the slip after one wash. ‚òπÔ∏è"
1.0,Might as well have purchased glass crystal or cubic zirconia. This is so cheap looking. I returned it ASAP.
1.0,Runs super small. No sequins!  Unfinished seams; just very cheaply made. Returned.
1.0,Big sloppy and tacky. I returned this mess
1.0,This was such an unusual sweater. I had high hopes after viewing all the pictures online. The waistline fit really weird. The arm pits didn‚Äôt fit right and it was way to short. Even with high waisted jeans.
1.0,Received today. Product is truly a piwce of s***.  And should only be sild in gumball machines.  Not even woeth returning. ...truly not worth even the 1 star.
1.0,Is wrinkled even when washed by hand and hanged to dry
1.0,"Shirt very short and wide. I'll wear it around the house, but not in public."
1.0,"The strap came twisted up which doesnt make for a good, comfortable fit. The strap also came with a small tear which doesnt allow for adjusting on that side cause the strap hangs up on the eyelet. The goggles I got were poorly assembled and falling apart straight out of the package. Also the vanquisher 2 is supposed to come in a cardboard box with a mesh storage pouch. This came in cheap plastic with no storage pouch of any kind."
1.0,"I never write reviews, but I wanted to make sure no one else bought this. There is some sort of weird stitching that makes the bottom go out in a semi-circle as if to add about 100 layers of lower-hanging thighs! Terrible, terrible! Do not buy. See the picture!!"
1.0,not good weak bend so easy. the only dog this would hold is a life less dog.
1.0,I should have read the review before purchasing. We were at party city and was looking for one and decided to look one up on Amazon instead. I should have bought the one at party city for $22 ( was a real size Toy Dino supercharge sword) not this little play knife. Plus I try to do a return and says it not for refund.
1.0,It fit like a potato sack.  Not flattering at all and just horrible overall
1.0,"I really thought these were going to be awesome.  They had a bad smell out of the bag, but washing them took care of the problem.  However, I  don't sew, so the tear in the seam after wearing them for 2 hours is super disappointing. Was planning on buying another set, but nope.  Sad because the fit was excellent.!"
1.0,had to return. the pockets were backward
1.0,"Horrible. Material was not what I expected, the cold shoulder flaps of material hung nothing like the picture, and I ordered the size recommended, which is my normal size (medium) and it was huge. Will be returning."
1.0,do not buy from this company. its made in Honduras  and they dont understand how to make.<br />freaking super tight in the crotch area. If you buy from them get 3X the size you normally get
1.0,Love a product that is usually sold in pairs going for one up
1.0,Very very cheap quality. My son didnt get a chance to wear them and the nose fell off
1.0,The hottest thing I ever wore
1.0,Smelled like fish
1.0,"Just wish this pattern were printed on a really cheap polyesther worsted yarn instead of a really cheap polyester jersey.  Yes, it is ugly enough, but because it's only printed on cheap and thin jersey, it prompted the comment, &#34;Oh!  It's not a REAL sweater so it won't qualify in ugly sweater contests.&#34;  I know that it was presented as what it is so it's my own fault for getting it anyway.  I still feel stupid for buying it and kind of ripped off.  How much more money would the manufacturer have had to spend to print this on a knitted sweater?  Even a thin knit would still be a sweater.  The profit the manufacturer is making is probably 90 to 95%.  (S)He's entitled to a profit and to benefit from stupid suckers like me, but it would be nice to, at least, get a sweater when something is called a sweater (even though it's presented as &#34;Faux Real&#34;  (What is faux real?  Either it is faux -- a fake -- or it is NOT a fake, in which case it is real. But it cannot be a &#34;faux real&#34; product.  That is the same as saying I am buying a white black sweater.  Which is it?)"
1.0,"This suit does not fit as shown or described online. The top portion is so narrow, it‚Äôs not suitable for public unless you hang at a nude beach. The bottom of the suit was perfect but the top portion of the one piece is so small and narrow, it‚Äôs just embarrassing. Sorry but this is a bad suit. Really bad."
1.0,This is a very lightweight coat and has no lining.  Disappointed with the quality.
1.0,I received this and the bar was extremely huge for starters. And the bar itself was not curled. I had to shape it. As I was doing so it snapped in half! NOT recommended as a good buy. Not happy with this purchase at all!
1.0,Product is not as advertised coloring is muddy and muted.
1.0,Poor quality. Wore it once and it snagged easily causing it to tear. I ordered it in white and it was a bit shear. It is not cotton as anticipated. Not worth the cost for a one time use. Also too big.
1.0,I ordered up a size and the waistline on this skirt was still way too small.  Also the fabric is not very nice.  I returned this and ordered another brand.
1.0,Already broken...cheaply made...think they would have been otherise fine
1.0,I have had a couple of these now and the buckle keeps breaking on them.
1.0,wore it once and it rusted. very poor quality
1.0,Y received the six dresses that I ordered one was damaged and really need the dress by next week have tried to get in contact with seller but useless. I don't need to return all the dresses just the one that is damaged but scared that I won't have time to return it and have a new one out. The dresses are so beautiful more than what I expected my issue is tthe one that came damaged so sad that the dress was not inspected before they send it.
1.0,Awful. I had such high hopes for this item because it was a birthday gift for my niece. She would look adorable. No such luck. My brother pulled it out of the packaging and it would appear the sewing machine this was made with had difficulties. It is falling apart because there are gapping holes all over. Cheaply made. So now I have to go back over each seam myself and properly sew it.
1.0,"Ordered 2 - XXL T-Shirts 3/4 sleeve... They fit like a Large Size... XXL should be XXL, not just regular large"
1.0,Cheap and just ugly
1.0,"Sorry Daxi Pin people....this is a pretty bad piece of jewelry...the pin does not stay in the clasp...it fell off my coat several times. I sent it back today. I didn't expect much for the price, but this was not worth nearly what you charge for it!"
1.0,Was shipped a different jacket. Different style and size. Returned
1.0,Go up at least 2 sizes. Normally a medium/large and it wouldn‚Äôt zip all the way. There‚Äôs no stretch to it. And the fabric is a crinkly material not super similar to what is shown. P
1.0,Turned my finger green after 2 hours of wearing it. Didn't get it wet or anything.
1.0,"Very dissapointed. These lenses do not fit the nose piece or the si ballistic m 3.0 frames as I would have thought. There is no hole in the center of the lense to secure it to the frames, the secure fit holes for the nose piece are non existent as well."
1.0,it broke when i got it within the first 2 days
1.0,"After waiting for 3 weeks for this product to arrive, I opened it to see that there is not ONE Russian Letter on this keyboard... What a waste of money :("
1.0,Cheap crap. Save your money. I can't read or see what is on these things with my eyeglasses on.
1.0,It's not a breakaway. The shipping to return it cost mote than the product. Completely disappointed.
1.0,"Within. 3 days boots completely fell apart, never buying again. Complete ripoff"
1.0,the sizing on this is ridiculous. i ordered a size larger than i usually wear and it was still 2 sizes too small.
1.0,Doesn't work. Not worth the money.
1.0,Nadamas basura.
1.0,"no instructions, no introduction to explain the function of the device, no operating procedure. very displeased. the alarm went off prematurely and I did not know how to shut it off. so I took it apart and disconnected a wire. I can't return because there is no return procedure included."
1.0,Kept slipping off my head while i ran.
1.0,I put it in the garbage
1.0,"The peter pan collar is floppy, the fabric is a gross metallic plastic, and the fit is awful. I've ordered Allegra K before, but apparently their products are not sold by the same people ..<br />I love peter pan collars but don't waste your money on this"
1.0,It does not stretch. Not good for bulky hairdo or big head
1.0,"the material, very disappointing"
1.0,"[[ASIN:B00HUU892E HDE Women's Shiny Leggings Metallic Wet Look Stretch Pants Clubwear (Hot Pink, XX-Large)]]<br /><br />I am sorry to leave such a negative review, but these leggings did not fit the sizes shown the size chart. I know there is an disclaimer in the description but I ordered the largest size for maximized comfort and still not a great fit. On the other hand, the color was perfect, exactly as shown."
1.0,Update: I don‚Äôt like these at all. The material is thin so it shows all my dimples and butt crease. It bunches weird at the bottoms even though it is the correct length and I am constantly having to pull them up. I‚Äôm glad I only paid $10 on sale for these or I‚Äôd be sending them back. House pants it is!<br /><br />I‚Äôm 140 lbs and 5‚Äô3 and finding leggings that fit and are short enough is tough for me. I ordered these because the inseam was short enough and these would have been a great length for me if they weren‚Äôt baggy in the ankles. I like the color and material. It is thin but not see through. Guess I‚Äôll just have to wear these around the house due to the ankles. I got a size small because other reviews said they ran big. Usually I‚Äôm a medium
1.0,This is completely opposite of what the picture shows! It's a rag!
1.0,"The material was nice, odd shape to them in the front.  The super came broken unfortunately! My daughter loved them and normally wears size12 ordered and and for normal, so order up size for sure!"
1.0,They tore when tried to put them on.
1.0,"Very misleading on the size. I'm a size, I ordered the Medium. They were so unbelievably small I couldn't get 1 leg into them. It's a shame I likes the fabric and color. I gave them to my 14 year old niece who is a size zero and they just fit her."
1.0,I was excited to receive these beautiful gloves but I was terribly disappointed when I tried them on. I ordered a size small but there was a half inch of glove at the end of each finger making them impossible to wear.
1.0,Broke the first time I used it. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Clearly I have been smoking crack because no review on this site mentions the fact that this mask DOES NOT CHANGE A PERSONS VOICE. Everyone mentions the stupid straps. Who care about the flipping straps or even the uneven weight of the mask when it doesn't even perform it's sole purpose of voice distortion. Everyone in my family from me, my husband, my five year old, my two year old twins, our cat, some random dude loitering in our street and my grandmother tried this mask in the hope it would make someone sound even slightly different to their usual speaking voice.....no, big ass fail. The only voice altering happening in my neighbourhood was the silly voices we made when we were trying to sound like death troopers. I give this mask - ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è. I bought it for my nearly 3 year old who is obsessed with troopers. Everything troopers. He eats with them, bathes with them and sleeps with them.  He even love trooper fridge magnets, yet even he thinks this mask is rubbish. Thanks mask, you Rui ed my little boys Christmas. My trooper worshiping lad preferred to spend his Christmas clinging onto his brothers minion doll......shame on you for promising voice distortion and instead delivering broken dreams."
1.0,The color was perfect. Too Too Small!!<br />Cheap price. Shipping more than item.<br />To send back cost 14.00. Unbelievable!!! Decided to keep and give away.
1.0,"I didn't order the green one, but that's what I got."
1.0,It's very very pretty but turned my finger green
1.0,Insanely large. Have to return
1.0,The quality seemed good until one of the clasps broke immediately.
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture, different color and print"
1.0,Tje watch did not work and i want to return it!
1.0,Poor quality. Broke before I even got a chance to wear it.
1.0,Pay attention.  This is trash.  Picture is even misspelled<br />Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,Makes a very loud creaking noise when you move! Do not buy!
1.0,I thought these socks were cushioned but they are not. I have had several threads loose. I put 1 sock on and my toe caught a thread and pulled a hole in one sock.
1.0,Broke within one wear.
1.0,Sizing was too small and sewing was terrible one side of bottoms thicker than the other. Bought for a gift. Had to return.
1.0,There is a inner fabric lining in the chest area that only comes about an inch down so end of the lining creates a line in the fabric right across the middle of my chest giving a very unpleasant look... I‚Äôll never wear this dress with the line showing across the middle of my chest.
1.0,Ordered a 3X so it would fit loose and it fits like an XL. Had to give it to my daughter.
1.0,It is very cheap looking. The boot has no structure and the heel wobbles. I wound up donating them without wearing them out. Would not recommend.
1.0,"OH FOR THE LOVE...!!! How can anyone justify trying to pass off a plain, solid grey bra to customers who purchase a bra CLEARLY advertised in photos as a lovely grey bra with pretty pretty black lace? VERY NAUGHTY! And NOT in a good way. Rude!"
1.0,Received bracelet with missing stones. Very disappointed.
1.0,I'm really hurt because it was for a special event and it wouldn't stay straight and closed on one of them.
1.0,too small by a lot.
1.0,"Bought this as a birthday present, he used it for a week and the inside lining cane undone and he can't use it anymore"
1.0,Faded for being sterling silver. I purposely only buy gold or sterling silver so it won't discolor. This was a gift and extremely embarrassing
1.0,Complete scam. The shorts are boxy and have no curve for a butt....and I barely have one! They are NOT low rise at all and there wasn‚Äôt even a button hole cut into them. Scam part is that it costs way more to return than to keep the crappy shorts!
1.0,Not at ALL what the picture portrays. Just buy a black watch band because this one has no gray in it at all.
1.0,I ordered a 3X and it was so small I couldn‚Äôt get the bottoms on.  The top was very tight.  I normally wear an 18/20 2x.  It‚Äôs a shame because the pattern is so cute!
1.0,"Ok, I bought this dress in the vibrant tie-dyed (TD) print and the white with blue at the bottom print. The TD one fit great and look great. The white one just fit off? I couldn't decide whether to pick somewhat large or somewhat small because the arm holes were big and fit awkwardly, and the dress from the back looked awkward, like the cut was off. So basically I am returning it. I am keeping the TD, which had none of these issues. But also the white is somewhat see through. You have been warned."
1.0,Sizing way off. Ordered 3 sizes up and it still didn't fit..too much of a hassle.
1.0,These things suck cheap plastic feel. Feels like i bought them at the dollar store
1.0,Need I write more?
1.0,Material very cheap looking. Fall apart on the bottom part. Lace starts to detach. Not very well made.
1.0,"Cut earrings,but way too heavy for my ears!"
1.0,Update without the button my glasses would stay put. They kept sliding out into my purse which completely defeats the purpose. If didn't matter if I used the front or back pocket. Which makes the front one useless to being seen because only the back one had a button. I ended up returning this.<br /><br />I've only had this a couple of days and the button already broke. Doesn't really bother me because I don't need it to hold my sunglasses in. The red color is a bit light but still ok. I was looking for a lightweight case to keep in my purse and this certainly does the job so I'm keeping it despite the button flaw.
1.0,It was awful! Completely unsewn on the seams.
1.0,"The suitcase description is incorrect.  The straps are not brown.  They are black and do not match my other Brics suitcases.  I would have returned the suitcase, if I had not needed it immediately when it arrived."
1.0,Poor qaulity and small fit. The shirt ripped before I even had it out of the packaging!
1.0,Cut weird.  Therefore it hung weird and the sleeves were extremely long. I wanted this shirt so bad yo match some pants I had purchased.  Had to return it  :(
1.0,"35 Below, maybe 35 above. Not warm socks."
1.0,Wrong size. No logo. Returned.
1.0,extremely cheap fabric! Don't waste your money. The material was itchy and it looked like plastic. I ignored the comments and went ahead and bought it. But this shirt was and cheap and I wouldn't recommend at all.
1.0,"Received the dress opened the bag and there was a 3 inch hole at the seam from poor stitching, fabric is very thin and looked like a night gown..."
1.0,This is my second one I‚Äôve ordered. The first was great. This one however falls off immediately- the magnet doesn‚Äôt stay together. Waste
1.0,Was too big because I ordered the wrong size but the material was cheap and it bent really easily. Do not recommend.
1.0,"I am so disappointed that although the ring looked beautiful , the stones are not held securely ! Within 1 hr of wearing the ring one of stones came out!"
1.0,Does not work to prevent glasses from fogging. I was in a hurry and didn't stop to read the reviews. Esson learned.. Don't buy these if your looking for masks to use with glasses.
1.0,"Medium sized, not xl"
1.0,Not padded at all. barely covers your nipple. Not a good purchase
1.0,"Low cost,poor quality.<br />1pair earrings missing,1pair earrings broken,fading quickly too"
1.0,"Good day to all.<br /><br />Truly I love to hail the accolades of a product.<br />By vast majority, the quality of items I've purchased on Amazon far exceeded their price<br />This sadly is not one of those times.<br />Altogether the manufacturer, Amazon and I lose in this endeavor.<br /><br />15 minutes ago I received this item in the mail<br />Before reading or opening it I noticed it was rather heavy to be earrings for my girlfriend who also holds an Executive Position.<br /><br />After seeing what was inside the package, I was instantly appalled and repelled.<br />These earrings look like something to be won at a County Fair and not worn in an Executive Office.<br />Even a child would be ashamed to wear this in any earnest venue. The only places I see fit for this item to be worn is in a Burlesque Show or donning the inside of a trash container.<br /><br />To say I cannot return this ghastly, gaudy, garishly ostentatious piece of offensive guffawnery too soon is the greatest understatement of creation.<br />If I could hurl them back to Kentucky from here I would.<br /><br />The other sad thing here is there are no negative star-ratings available.<br />Minus 5 stars is far too good for this item as based upon by its description of so-called ‚Äúquality, craftsmanship, durability and appeal.‚Äù<br /><br />I actually considered making them into what they look most like which are fishing-lures.<br />Based upon the fact that no one enjoys true scorn, mockery, ridicule and being laughed-at as I can imagine the fish doing to me when seeing one of those things, I quickly changed my mind.<br /><br />So; do I recommend this product?... Something is very wrong if anyone has to ask that question; that is, unless you perform Burlesque or live in a haunted house where hanging them on the door is likely to remove and keep out those evil spirits.<br /><br />I want my money back with the same dispatch with which I spent it PLEASE!"
1.0,This design was cute but the fabric was not breathable at all! You just sucked the fabric into your moth or nose.
1.0,"I was so excited about receiving this swim suit based off of the reviews/pictures...however, it was a huge disappointment! First off, the swim suit material is not great, very thin and the bottoms are see through! The padding in the top was all dented up and made my top half look super awkward! I ordered a small and the top was HUGE... hanging off of me big. Bottoms fit fine but not great quality- Overall, I would not order this swim suit. Quality is terrible and sizing is way off!"
1.0,Runs small and very cheaply made compared to other similar slips and gowns I bought.  Lots of pulled threads and broke one strap.  I'm returning this.
1.0,I ordered these before and liked them.  This order smelled like mold. I cannot wear them
1.0,"It was cheap and the qualify is not good. Also, the product doesn‚Äôt answer what i am looking for."
1.0,Ripe the third time time wearing
1.0,Pretty shirt just terrible materiel. I itch like crazy in it. It is a touch small for my regular size also. Maybe off a half size.
1.0,Cheaply made.  Can‚Äôt return even though I‚Äôm amazon prime member
1.0,"Totally different jacket than picture . Kept cause needed for edvent , still want the one in picture much nicer than item I received ."
1.0,"I agree with prior review. Bellbottom legs, very wide. They look nothing like on the picture. Nice slimming top of the pants but starting knees and down they are super wide. I‚Äôm a fan of Columbia pants and shorts but I disappointed with this product due to incorrect image and actual product. Girl on the picture wears different pants for sure. Im returning mine"
1.0,Horrible product I ordered 2 sizes bigger and it fit two sizes smaller then my normal size. Would never recommend this product I wish I could get all my money back. Wouldn't let me give it no stars so had to give it one. But would rather give it zero
1.0,"Not worth buying straps were way to long need they are double what they should be I donated them thur amazons give back program. Product is no where what is shown in the picture, the picture shows a trim at top and at top, what a recived was thin materal that I could have tore about by hand."
1.0,Its really cheap In quality was not happy with it at all.
1.0,Product don‚Äôt close anymore after 1 month of use
1.0,I needed small tops as I have medium and they all look too big on me. Got this because it looked nice and was reasonably priced. Ordered small size. The small fits like a medium! It‚Äôs still long where it has to be rolled under. I‚Äôm not even small or skinny and I need extra small. Small should be short and tight fitting. Very disappointed and a waste of money!
1.0,this jacket is always - not available. every year its the same story.maybe I should order one in july or august.
1.0,Very small and the material is very uncomfortable and unflattering
1.0,Didn‚Äôt come in the size I ordered.
1.0,Highly disappointed
1.0,Losing elasticity
1.0,The pin is actually quite beautiful and looks very professional. What's very unprofessional is when the back of it comes smashed and melted together so it's completely useless. I'm returning it as soon as possible.
1.0,I brought this large. it look like size xs for me. not even fit me at all
1.0,"Bad, bad, bad, I only received 2 sets of inserts not three. They arrived in a plastic bag that wasn't even sealed. It looks like some random bag that was laying around. I asked someone who purchased these before and was told no, that is NOT how they are supposed to arrive. They look as if they have potential but not going to try them out because of how they arrived to me. Very disappointed."
1.0,If you are a size 10 buy a size 11
1.0,Made cheap . I returned. The bands were not attached or finished. Very disappointed I own 8 Sweaty Rocks leggings but this pair was not their normal quality
1.0,"The clasp is plastic, not metal. Rip off."
1.0,"That one shoe might have been okay. If you're only looking to buy one shoe, this is probably the place for you. I need two shoes, one for each foot. I realize that is my journey and it's not like that for everyone."
1.0,Made in China Beware different size charts. Terrible fabric!
1.0,Fits larger than expected...
1.0,The fit was fine but the material was not like a sweatshirt. It was shiny. But not like wicking athletic material. Did not like it. Returned it with no concerns.
1.0,my wife did not  like it. she thought the stone was extremely small and the clasp difficult to handle. when I told her the price she felt I was ripped off.
1.0,"If it had a negative star option I would pick that. Thin, see through, cheap, and scratchy material. Returned it immediately."
1.0,"these are NOT a soft silicone which is what I was looking for so that they would be comfortable for sleeping, they are a cheap hard plastic and have extra plastic bits left on some of them making them not smooth at all. they are very abrasive and I had one in my ear for maybe 5 minutes and my ear is still irritated and itchy the next day. NOT WORTH IT"
1.0,bigger than expected and it takes up too much space
1.0,This dress is not flattering at all.<br />It is box like and stiff. Not what is pictured at all!<br />I bought it for a wedding and had to run out and buy a new dress.
1.0,"I ordered XL - I am a size 14 - when the dress arrived I couldn‚Äôt even get it on, let alone button it up, I gave it to a size 8 co-worker"
1.0,I returned these. They just weren't what I wanted.
1.0,Belt was completely missing!
1.0,Lost it‚Äôs color and shine quickly and magent doesn‚Äôt stay in one place. It slides around making my fit bit looser as the day goes on.
1.0,Jacket is odd too loose in the body and length too short.
1.0,"It looked cute in the pictures. But when I got it, it was made of the kind of cheap material you would use for a kid‚Äôs Halloween costume, very rough and thin."
1.0,Crap!!  Don't buy!!!
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt like it at all, it was way too big. The pockets were by my thigh, the dress has no form to it. I look like a potato sack in it."
1.0,It runs small. Had to return.
1.0,Horrible! Don't purchase.
1.0,I have Dupuytrens  syndrome in both my hands with my right hand being worse so I bought these because of the ratings and the fact that had gel padding inside. Well unfortunately if there‚Äôs any gel padding it is so minuscule that it can‚Äôt be felt. These gloves do nothing to aid The palms of my hands when riding my bicycle. If I could send them back I would. Do not recommend.
1.0,The lenses turned funny odd colors after a month..
1.0,Didn't fit my watch. Every time I tried to attach it it would pop right back off cause it was to big.
1.0,Not even going to bother to call Amazon about this product.  It only starts ticking if I tap on the glass gently the batteries must be dead  Sign in concert this minus the head is so big that it keeps  Wasting on my wrist doesn't stay in place  wasting on my wrist it doesn't stay in place
1.0,the little Handel for the pin broke off and was extremely hard to take off and I'm not putting it back on.
1.0,"Hot glued, felt decorations started separating from the actual headband after one use. I like the festive design and color of the product. It fell apart so quickly that you might as well buy some quality hot glue if you plan on purchasing this. I do not recommend."
1.0,Looks great and felt great BUT it fell apart  after  3 weeks of wearing  and mind you I don't wear it all day....... I would never order for this person again
1.0,This Item was described as being a Linen Suit but it's a Polyester suit.
1.0,"I knew this sizing would suck, so I got the biggest size...like a 5XL or something insane like that. It JUST fits my 12 year old daughter who is a size 12/14. Its thin and weird material. Do not recommend."
1.0,"Too short for Maxi, but able to use around the house"
1.0,I ordered a  medium because I wanted it to be loose as it is pictured.  Well it doesn‚Äôt fit as expected.  I guess I should have ordered a large.  The sleeves bludge up at the seems which may not do this on bustier women they seem to sit better if I pull the shirt out a bit but I do not have a large busy area.  This material is thicker than I imagined and soft but overall I‚Äôm not pleased with the fit.  I would return it for a larger size which I think would be better but it took a while to get to me in the US as I think it was sent from China.  I would say size up if you want the look in the picture.
1.0,This is a piece of junk! This belly ring completely fell apart after about a week of wearing it. It's very pretty and I liked the design a lot but the bottom piece just fell off when I tried to adjust it. Do not waste your money.
1.0,"Ordered up 2 sizes and it would barely go over my chest, I'm a D so not some outrageous size."
1.0,"So the construction of the items is on the economic side of the spectrum. But the size is wayyy small. Abnormally so like the person in charge of the posting was give the wrong chart for the US. The size is more a boys sizing if that is the case I believe it would fit well... I got a 3xl thinking that some people have said they run small but this is crazy small. The price is right but ""the size wrong"""
1.0,Silent.  Doesn‚Äôt ding.  Clappers are malfunctioning on both that I ordered.
1.0,"I purchased this bathing suit from beachsissi as well as four other suits. Most of them did not fit as described. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 145lbs. 34C. I don‚Äôt expect to look like the model wearing it, but I do hope for it to be flattering in some way. It was not. Shoulder straps too long even after fully adjusted. I‚Äôve read some of the reviews and I agree with them that the v neck is way too low. Whether big chested or small chested, it just doesn‚Äôt work. And to top it off, Beachsissi‚Äôs customer service was terrible to me when I tried to return for refund.  It was going to cost me more to ship them back than it cost for all 5 suits! It was crazy. So I kept them and basically had $100+ stolen from me. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Amazon and most of their vendors, but this ones a bad one if you have one thing go wrong. Good luck!"
1.0,The bra itself is beautiful. Doesn't look cheap but since it was way to small I cant really say. I wear a 38C normally and ordered a 2 sizes larger than what the sizing chart recommended. Still was way to small
1.0,The goggles broke before my son even put them on. We had to get replacement pair.
1.0,"Ordered #55, received #19; huge disappointment for my daughters xmas present"
1.0,Need to return asap
1.0,"Great dress if you want everyone to see your under bits! It does fit as expected, but the material is super cheap feeling and very much see through. I don‚Äôt even know that a full body slip would help because even that would be seen."
1.0,"Glasses wouldn't focus, all was still Blurry, ant worth buying!!!"
1.0,"Definitely not the size it states, it's not a DDD according to the size scale in the USA.<br /> I have DDDS made in USA and I compared this bra to them and it's much smaller. Clothes and bras made in China are much smaller than the size in the United States if it is a large than the United States is going to be a extra large according to China's size size.<br />People seem to be thinner in China but also the women seem to in general, have smaller bodies and breast than women doing westernized Nations.<br />I would love to buy bras from China but they need to make them larger in cup size according to the size scale and westernized Nations not the size scale in China because the sizes are smaller.<br />Americans eat too much junk food."
1.0,Shirt dit good. But arms were way short. Shiping took a month
1.0,My product was defective.
1.0,"The necklace was cute and as advertised. However, the second I removed it from the packaging it immediately broke. I went to get a new one and they were unavailable. I‚Äôm super disappointed."
1.0,"I received my coat,  I love it until I saw the small tearüòï do I need to send this back for refund, please help üòï"
1.0,"[[ASIN:B01N5LHAEW Women Summer Casual Cotton Short Sleeve Purecolor Tee Shirt Tops]]<br />I've been buying on Amazon for more than a decade and have never had to leave a negative review before, but... I bought three of these shirts, and to be fair, the black one and the red one are fine, but the green one has white patches on it in several places and a hole right in the front. The material on all of them is thinner than I expected it to be to begin with, but the green shirt it unwearable. A little better quality control before shipping may be in order. I am returning it."
1.0,I returned this dress as the fabric was shiny.
1.0,Not a speck of glitter on it. Disappointed.
1.0,Heavy and awkward. Disappointed.
1.0,"I bought this purse for those times when you need a smaller bag to go to certain venues plus some require clear bags. I like that this will fit my phone, keys, and wallet plus a little more. It's also cute which doesn't hurt.<br />*** Update 10/15/19 I took this on vacation and the strap connection broke while on an excursion. I only used it for a week before it broke so can't recommend."
1.0,"I bought this product the classification was different when I got it, it‚Äôs not 42 mm it‚Äôs only 36 mm and said it‚Äôs made in Japan but it‚Äôs not."
1.0,Ordered the 29th of November won't receive until the 7 of january. Not happy  i feel by reviews it will be junk and either sent back or burned. I'd give half a star of i could.
1.0,Nice glasses but weak material. They broke after the third week of use. Not worth the money.
1.0,My husband used it only 5 times and the strap got broken!!!
1.0,Stone came loose after a few days.
1.0,Received this bracelet and it broke the first time my done put it on. Do not purchase.
1.0,This bracelet is not ted
1.0,"What they send is definitely NOT the same product as pictured on the model.<br />I am 5'8&#34; and 140 lbs.<br />The lace isn't &#34;v&#34; in the back, not as long as pictured, and not as baggy as pictured. The sleeves were barely loose. It looks more like a cardigan. Disappointed.<br />I am returning it."
1.0,"Cheap material, your ‚Äúheadlights‚Äù will show all night & provides absolutely no support at all."
1.0,"Waterproof??? Are you kidding me? They're made of mesh, and not even tight mesh! At least an entire side of each bag was loose mesh material!  Sad! (Returned!)"
1.0,The print on this is so small you can't read it.
1.0,this product shouldn't be recommended for men.  It is far too small for an average to above average man's head.
1.0,"The size 6 (EU37) fit perfectly; however the rainbow colored straps were not even. Therefore, one sandal fit okay and the second was very loose. Also, the black piece of material that goes between the toes were both different sizes. One was 50% longer than the other. All this makes these sandals impossible to wear. However, shipping them back to China is not worth it.<br />Also, the rainbow strap on my sandals were not brightly colored as advertised. The description said it was nylon canvas weave. I expected more of a yarn material. However, the material seemed to be like a rough & faded paper straw or paper film raffia...made into a friendship bracelet & sewn onto the strap. I could probably deal with the material if both sandal straps would of been made/measured properly at least."
1.0,Sent back  First of all it barely fit my nephews 4 month old head and was extremely poorly made  Ply 9 weeks for delivery
1.0,It is cheap and the band size it a lot smaller then shown.
1.0,"The description seemed to imply the finger covers were protective - those orange things are essentially latex glove tips, and exactly as flimsy as that.  One use and they tear."
1.0,unless you are using it for a Christmas party I would not recommend this bag it is multi colored with different colors red blue yellow green not at all appropriate for a formal evening
1.0,wrongs glasses came in box. square and black is what i got. lol
1.0,Fits super tight or was sized wrong
1.0,I purchased this thing because it was super cheap and i had a faint hope that it could do something it is a good gimic and nothing else.
1.0,Not rose gold at all. Also not assembled properly. The lock release is on the wrong side.
1.0,very poor quality fabric. it's black but you can see through it. this is getting returned.
1.0,JUNK!!!! wore them once and after washing they look like rags
1.0,Terrible product. Like a child‚Äôs size. I would return it but it would prob cost me more $$$
1.0,It was so small and uncomfortable it made me mess with my mask more. I ended up returning.
1.0,These are made for the little people.  This product is from China and made to fit small people.... Doesn't come close to fitting US sizes.  Disappointing.
1.0,Too tight in the arms
1.0,"Broke and can't shock after two months, became useless, support made it a hassle to get it replacing by requiring you to schedule a meeting with someone on meets, wtf does that, waste of money"
1.0,The strands pulled out of clasp first day!!
1.0,The dress is a much thicker fabric than expected. Not light and airy for a summer dress. We had purchased for a pool cover up but the dress is much too heavy cotton for that purpose. The waist was also rather thick. My daughter is very lean and fit but she and I both felt the waist band was rather thick. The picture is cuter than when the dress is on.
1.0,"Crap quality, do not recommend at all! Purchased for my son to wear 4 days a week to swim team and within 2 weeks they were almost gray in color from fading so much and stretched out in the waist. Had to then buy something else within only 2 weeks. Not worth the low price when thed wua little is so terrible!"
1.0,"UPDATE!  Tigrade contacted me saying sorry for the stones falling out and offered me a refund/replacement for a more favorable review.  I was ok with a refund and to change it saying something regarding their willingness to help only to get this message from them: (direct quote from email) Ok, we can refund a half to you first, then you changed your review, we will refund another half to you. Waiting for your reply. Thanks very much.  ALL that for a 4 or 5 Star Review. I of course said this is not acceptable in any manner or fashion this is now how customer service is done.  This company ONLY wants 4 of 5 star ratings they don't care if their product is flawed or not as long as you give them 4 of 5 stars that is what matters to them.  Once I made them aware that is not how I will go about there final message was and I quote: Ok, we have refunded to you. Hope you can help us leave 4 or 5 stars.  Of course if I could I would give them -5 stars for this do not bully me for your ratings rather make sure your product is of good and above standard quality and you will be those ratings to but say half for a star is not good in any fashion of business.<br /><br />Got it and was like WOW this is awesome and it fit just a little snug but I prefer that don't have to worry about it falling off my finger but then after having it for about 3 weeks I took it off when I have to do some cleaning with chemicals and noticed that 2 small stones had fallen out...that really bummed me out as it was so pretty just hate that stones didn't stay. (Have since this original post had another 3 stones for a total of 5 stones fall out)"
1.0,"I ordered the black one, arrived promptly,  and I loved it.  So I ordered the white and the purple ones.  They took weeks to arrive from China and are not the same - very tight in the shoulders.  Very disappointed!<br /><br />Two different sellers: black one from vansop - loved it.<br /><br />White and purple ones from Pig Paige - unwearable."
1.0,"After wear several times, the glass fall off. Don‚Äôt bother to buy it,  If you don‚Äôt want to search the car up and down to find the glasses"
1.0,Definitely not champagne coloured. Very definitely silver.
1.0,Material felt like paper. They recommended i wash it to soften that DID NOT WORK.<br />The did give me an $8 credit<br />Not a good purchase.
1.0,Received it. Tried it. Threw it away (because sending back was too much of a hassle. I usually wear XS or S (5'5 & 120lbs... and pretty typical dimensions). Ordered a medium (to account for length): waste is TINY and skirt is SHORT (above ankle). Don't buy.
1.0,It's heavy.  The flowers around the arms are just big and look weird. Not what I was expecting.
1.0,"Solo una lavada y lleno de motas qued√≥, terrible"
1.0,"Wasn't impressed. The ""Stargate"" is thin and cheaply made. If you're a real SG fan you won't be happy with this."
1.0,I purchasedXL but it was way too tight
1.0,Not shiny at all very dull looking not as pictured
1.0,I gave up after 20mins trying to get the strap to fit.  The original one took 2secs to be put back on.
1.0,So these horns are really well made and substantial feeling. Very elegant and weighty. Plus they look amazing. But the horns are so much heavier than the headband that they slide around and slip off. I couldn‚Äôt take three steps without them falling forward. Ended up returning them.
1.0,It‚Äôs awful material! Super cheap scratchy material. Like the super cheap tee you get screen printed! Look cheap even!
1.0,Fabric (polyester/spandex) makes this dress feel very cheap. Flattering cut but too loose on top and bottom hit the floor in the back. Disappointing considering reviews.
1.0,Cheap and the rubber left little blisters
1.0,RIP OFF!! DO NOT BUY!!! Came the size for a toy doll
1.0,"So far so good.  a little firmer than the original, but i got used to it.  Now lets wait and see how long it will last.<br /><br />8 months later, the screw holes have become bigger and the belt keeps coming off."
1.0,Too short and too small. I am normally an xlg and I ordered a 2x and it was way too small!
1.0,Returned because the fit was not good.
1.0,The rings are cute but opening and closing are a hassle. I had the silver one on and I couldn't get it off. I ended up having to cut it off.
1.0,Material is terrible. Ripped after 1 month. Fits very small
1.0,"I ordered this item, then AMAZON sent me another model (BALET TYPE) shoes... I returned it, tried to explain the reason (but I think nobody even reads what we write)... I ordered AGAIN the same shoes, and guess what? AMAZON sent me AGAIN the same Naturino Balet Model.<br /><br />Too time consuming... Keeping ordering and returning products. I understand there is something wrong with the CODE of this product with the whatever catalog they use to send the item... But I gave up ordering this product."
1.0,The material is too thin. See right through it. Not a good look.
1.0,"These pants are nothing like the pants in the picture. They arrived super wrinkled, and the fabric is weird.  I had my skinny child try the pants on to see if maybe it was a sizing issue,  but no.  These pants are a bad cut and won‚Äôt look good on any body type."
1.0,Great design but changed colors after a week
1.0,The dress does not fit as it should. It has a weird extra flap that I can't figure out where it goes Of course I missed the return date so unfortunately I am stuck with it. Save your money and buy else where
1.0,These shoes appear to be men‚Äôs shoes. They‚Äôre very big! Not true to size.
1.0,band broke by July 6.....don't waste your money!
1.0,Not what I expected but could have been me not reading the description
1.0,"Picture shows as a Kelly Green, it came<br />As a dark forest green color!"
1.0,It is very thin..<br />You need to cover your buth  with your thisrt when u are were in it...
1.0,"The watch came in a plastic bag inside a cardboard shipping box. No original Seiko box, no manual, no warranty card!!!!  Watch appeared to be used. Bought this as a gift, but now I am embarrassed to present it.  I have no choice but to return it."
1.0,"Bad, I used during the day and on night stoped, next day some times it stop or get ahead, and now I  can't return it, what a nightmare. So what to do."
1.0,"Not good material. You‚Äôll have tons of issues with static cling. Nothing like your eye lashes wanting to stick to the lenses, irritating."
1.0,"do not buy the red one, the colors are all wrong, red is so light you couldn't tell it was supposed to be red, black is very faint almost like a dark bluish grey, the white is egg shell, false advertising and no return policy"
1.0,"No metal nose bridge. Large enough to be worn over another mask that has one, if you are looking for an accessory."
1.0,A seam split on the first time wearing these gloves. Hands are average size. Unacceptable
1.0,Infected my ears
1.0,This is not flattering at all and its uncomfortable. The fit is super awkward.  I should have gone with my gut and trusted the negative reviews I read. I'll be returning this.
1.0,Seams at bottom of legs fell out.
1.0,its &#34;okay&#34;
1.0,Not cute. Looks nothing like the picture. Has ugly side patches and is not long. Is a light grey. Just looks like a regular ugly sweater for the sports section
1.0,Returned to seller as I agree with Marc B and the watch(s) Bluetooth did not function at all. Now I'm being charged a restocking fee by the seller for a product that was defective - so will be contesting that.
1.0,Received wrong size. Ordered size 11 and received a 13. Couldn't use them and I need to return them. Pls instruct me on how to do so
1.0,They are not true size and are made in China
1.0,The shoes are too small for my daughter. I ordered a size 13 which is what she wears and they are too small. Go up a size or 2.
1.0,Tangles very easy.
1.0,Not what I expected. The whole in the back looks funny on in my opinion. I returned.
1.0,"Wore it for the first time and didn't even realized it fell off, cheap material, waste of my money."
1.0,Felt cheap and low quality
1.0,Read reviews that this was about one size smaller than normal.. Try about 2 sizes or more...
1.0,"The magnet isn't all that strong, so I was constantly pulling it tighter for fear that my watch would fall off my wrist. I maybe wore this a total of 15 or 16 days out of the past four months since owning it, and it's already broken. The band nearly came completely apart on the non-looping end, and it was hanging by a thread by the time I noticed it. Luckily for me I did not lose my watch, or have it fall off my wrist and get damaged as a result. This is not an Apple product, but a knock-off, so buyer beware. You get what you pay for in this case."
1.0,"Material is not like the description. It is very similar to paper scrubs you receive in a hospital. The cut is also off, which is hard to do with ‚Äòloose‚Äô shorts. Just awkward.l"
1.0,"The item pictured is not what I received. Ordered the mini snap pendant necklace, was sent standard/chunk snap pendant necklace. :("
1.0,It was missing the Moon as you can see in the picture!<br />I tried sending a message but I suppose it didn't reach the place. All I wanted was for them to send the missing part if I had gotten a response I would not have left a negative review.
1.0,when I opened the package it looks like somebody already wore the top
1.0,"Material of shoe was as ghetto as possible!! Everything sticks to these shoes especially wood chips from the playground!! The wiser part is that the tongue is held on by 2 stitches on each side, do it flips inside out every time I open it up to put my sons foot in and to flip it in after his foot is in is impossible!! Cannot rats this shoe lower than one star unfortunately!! No padding either it's just like a few colors of 23¬¢ felt glued together & called a shoe!"
1.0,"Thought this was adult size, but very evident it is for skinny teenagers. Will have to send it back.  It was purchased through Amazon from ESY Bride.<br />It was nice quality and if I had a teenager that could wear it, I would recommend it."
1.0,"I'm 5'1, 139 lbs, 34A bust. I ordered a small. The fit was weird. I like the A-line cut, but it's tight from the bust up. Returned it."
1.0,"It was advertised as SOFT, they are NOT soft."
1.0,Never had sock tear.  This one did.  Never buy again from copper fit.
1.0,"Returning item - horrible quality. I took it on a short hike (4 hours) and was very unhappy with how it performed. I experienced multiple drawstring failures, the straps constantly slipped (loosened), and the fabric on top of the main compartment is tearing at the seams. Not worth it if you plan on actually using it, even if it is cheep."
1.0,Not a good buy. Quality is poor and it does not look like pic
1.0,I'm not impressed with the product. It looks much better in the photo. The bag looks cheap and I'm still trying to get rid of the smell.
1.0,These types of masks are super thin and they don‚Äôt have a way to insert a filter. Doesn‚Äôt protect at all.
1.0,"I bought this item the first of month, it is now Dec. 27th and I sill have not received it even though I received an email saying it was shipped on Dec. 3rd so you get a bad rating for this one."
1.0,Posts are too short!
1.0,I love this key so much that I ordered 2 more when we got a new lock. Although it says universal it is not. It‚Äôs for a 68. New key is KW1 or 66. I am so bummed. It can‚Äôt be made into new key üò≠üò≠üò≠ I hope this helps someone.
1.0,"I thought this would feel elegant and Victorian, but it had more of a little house on the prairie vibe. Also, the skirt is very thin and see-through and it was small in the bust area."
1.0,"They send things that simply can't fit, and then let you know that shipping back is expensive. BS BS BS BS<br /><br />I weigh 190 and wear size Large in virtually everything. I ordered XXL and it needs another 6 inches.<br /><br />They offered a 10% break. BS BS BS"
1.0,"The day I put it in, i went to the gym and worked out thinking nothing of it & the dangling bow and pearls had already broken off. Better off just going to hot topic or piercing pagoda"
1.0,"I bought three colors in this similar style made by AX Paris. This style is not flattering at all on me. But of all three, I thought this color was the worst. Doesn't look at all like the picture. It was supposed to be a &#34;Rose.&#34; This color is UGLY. Looks old and dirty. From some of the other reviews, it seems that this color can differ per lot.<br />The nude color is prettier. Runs a bit small in the chest area and tightest at the empire waist seam. Below that, its huge and flow-y. Didn't look good on me at all; added 20 pounds. For reference, I am 5'8 and wear a 12-14 but ordered a 16 for some reason. Length was to the floor needing at least a 2 inch heel to keep off the ground. A 14 would've been better, but then the bottom half would have been enormous. I ordered a 12 in the other 2 colors."
1.0,"My daughter loves the color patterns of these and the size is perfect. However, a majority of the masks are broken or the string snaps off within minutes of putting it on rendering it completely useless. I do not recommend buying these."
1.0,I ordered a XL I'm normally a medium I couldn't even get it on. I do not think it's meant for anybody that's taller than 5'5 . I have a small waist little butt size d38 breasts and this was not even big enough to pull over both my arms. I followed the size chart and even ordered up a few sizes to be safe and fail! On top of that the sewing quality is horrible material is cheaper than i expected. Very sad I have to return something to a amazon seller for the first time i normally find any reason to keep it or give it to someone else but not this thing. Ps. It also isnt like in the picture its different in material and sleeves are different
1.0,Feels like it‚Äôs going to fall apart it‚Äôs so crunchy.  It good quality at all üòí
1.0,TERRIBLE product.
1.0,I just opened the bracelets. I went to put it on my daughter‚Äôs wrist and the lobster clasp broke! Not happy with it!
1.0,Bought for the wife. The dangle part broke the first day she wore it. Do not recommend.
1.0,Item was twice as small and it took almost two months to get here would not recommend seller.
1.0,Size runs too Small
1.0,Didn't like it at all.
1.0,"I'm an average size man and have had good luck with other arm sleeves. I thought these might be nice just to be different. Well, I was so disappointed. They were flimsy, large in the wrist area, too small of a thumb hole (although the hole was stitched nicely), upper arm slipped down to my elbows in a matter of a few minutes of golf. These were such a disappointment since they looked nice upon opening the package."
1.0,Sleeves are way too tight and it's way too small
1.0,Look at the photo and then read the description. I ordered and received the wrong item.
1.0,"Was 2 to 3 sizes to small. Material was very thin and could see through it. Seams looked as if they were worn, they were pulled apart and in some places the seams were busted open.<br />Wasn't worth the money at all."
1.0,"VERY poorly made. The picture is completely crooked and it looks terrible. And it smells awful too! AND it says ‚Äúanything‚Äôs is,‚Äù which is an absurd typo (but I will admit the picture says that so it was my failure to read closely on that)."
1.0,By the writeup on this product I expected an actual winter coat.  It is not unless you live in Hawaii LOL...... material is cheap and flimsy..... i could have gotten a better deal and nicer coat at wal-mart
1.0,"Had to discard, wouldn‚Äôt snap shut"
1.0,problems with size chart
1.0,Product is trash.
1.0,Was supposed to be able to block rdf ID readers I have moved my pass card around in it even all the way inside and the reader at the gate can see it from 3 feet away it does not do what it's supposed to do not trust it to provide you with any security . I am still looking for a compact RDF ID wallet that works
1.0,"Weird design, I didn‚Äôt care for the wrap, it was awkward, it wasn‚Äôt flattering at all. I ordered an XL I‚Äôm 5/4 170, it fit like. Potatoes sack, ordered a large fit okay but just weird."
1.0,"Material is very thin! Its not like the thicker athletic material you would typically expect.  My husband wears a 42 pant we got XXL and it was a little tight.  My husband is working to loose weight and these will do.  He is going to keep them and use for swim shorts.  They are that thin im telling you!  They also make noise when you walk.  Like ""cheap material"" noise.  He compared them to a garbage bag."
1.0,Ordered two of these and when they arrived both didn‚Äôt have pockets and that‚Äôs what I needed. Bummer as these looked nice.
1.0,It‚Äôs given me allergic reactions both when I tried two separate ones on nose and tear piercings. Turning green slightly also on only week two of wear
1.0,Runs short at the waist and the hood is too large and dopey.  Not a good looking sweatshirt.  Fabric is really cheap too.
1.0,This XXL Fits like a true medium!! Very disappointed to say the least. It was the largest size available... needless to say that I will be returning the item.
1.0,Way too big. Sizes do not correlate
1.0,"I opened this package yesterday and when I tried it on and looked at myself in the mirror, I found a large hole in the back of the dress. Very poorly made and kept, through it arrived in a sealed plastic bag. Quality control was not well done for this dress."
1.0,Definitely not made for large busts or long torsos. I got a 3X like the size chart suggested for my size and this fits more like a S. I ordered this because it showed up when I was looking for plus size lingerie so I gave it a shot. I was left feeling like absolutely dog doo doo when I put it on. Was not the confidence boost I was hoping for.
1.0,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend! Unless u Want material that has been cut not hemmed and just sent to u! Really. Very unprofessional
1.0,I don‚Äôt like the way is designed. Is kind of tricky to put it on
1.0,Claims to be mens XL but looks more like a kid's.
1.0,I truly wanted to like this shirt but stitching coming loose after first wash terrible quality I'd ask for them to send another but I know that ain't happening if they read this and make good I'll change the review
1.0,Need to return unbelievably small and inexpensive In appearance
1.0,This outfit reeked of smoke. It was so awful. And it was way too big for my 6 year old who is extremely tall for her age.
1.0,Had to return this item due to a nasty odor.  I tried to clean the leather but the mold/mildew odor was there to stay.
1.0,Super disappointed in this product. It is not water proof at all. Super cheap material and hard to access items in bag .
1.0,The dress is beautiful in person but runs pretty small. That‚Äôs allü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1.0,Very disappointed in this product.  Ordered a second one in different color And sent both back.  The fabric Didnotlook like<br />traditional Linen!
1.0,Much too small for a 2X
1.0,I bought this for someone who is 5'6&#34; and 170 pounds and a medium in every single shirt he owns. He couldn't even get this shirt to button it was so small on him. The material was also very thin. I ended up throwing this in the goodwill bin. Don't waste your money on this shirt.
1.0,"Real cheap materials for the price.  The magnetic clasp is pretty cool, but the plastic they use looks cheap.  I wouldn't pay more than $25 for this.  If they want to charge $60, then they need to use higher quality materials."
1.0,This dress has no shape and is wayyyyy to big. The picture is deceiving because it will not fit on your waist as shown. Please do not waste your money.
1.0,Bought it for my grandson and it was sewn funny in the sleeve area. Have to return it.
1.0,"I know it's too late to write a recommendation after years, but let me say that it's a waste of money. Push up is too big and it's uncomfortable. Also, after a few washes, the iron below the bras would come out and the laces curls away. Don't buy it all."
1.0,"Very overpriced and ineffective. These are not substantial enough for cold weather, they are very thin and I noticed no difference with these worn over my gloves. Also, there is a grip ""hole"" in the palm which was unclear in the listing - the entire palm is missing. The palm hole also prevents the glove from helping warm your hands. The way listing is setup currently you can't pick a size either. I buy a lot on Amazon and this is probably the most disappointed I've been in years. I would have returned them, but I foolishly thought I would try them even with the thin material and palm hole. They were ineffective and a waste of money."
1.0,I bought the shirt on sept 9 so I could wear it for tomorrow when hocus pocus 2 come out so tonight I finally decide to open the package and try on the shirt and that's when I see there's a huge hole on the side üôÑ definitely returning it üòë
1.0,"loved the earrings and the sparkle but after wearing 2 times, the entire post broke off of 1 and I had to return for refund."
1.0,The battery on one of these shoes died less than 3 days after he got them for Christmas.
1.0,This item should be described as for kids size. Too small and not worth the money even though it is on sale. This is my opinion.
1.0,Not worth it. They fall off your head because the headband isnt long enough to compensate the antlers being so big.
1.0,Too large and the original advertised picture was not what I expected.
1.0,The stitching starts coming out after the first washing
1.0,"you will get a set of size 1 and size 2 temple shocks. but they don't fit very good. they are supposed to seat inside the frame and stay, these are formed too thick and will not stay in the frame.actually. of each set i have lost of of each.  the ear socks fit well"
1.0,I was shocked at how very tiny the earrings are.  The picture of the earrings on the model is very misleading.
1.0,Quality is very cheap. Threading was loose. Wore one and after ting it; it fell a apart.
1.0,"**i received these at a discount for my review**<br /><br />these are WAY too big for a 3yr old girls face.... probably going to send them back.<br /><br />update: Already broke within a couple hours, lens scratched easy, daughter kept popping lens out too. Sending back for refund. I hope the boys ones are more durable."
1.0,"These are great looking, but impossible for my son to get his foot into"
1.0,Can‚Äôt wait to return these
1.0,Very Cheap material. Like dollar store table cloth. Also very small in size
1.0,MATERIAL was cheaper than I expected.  Real flimsy
1.0,Really narrow shoulders. No stretch in fabric. Poorly made. Don‚Äôt bother
1.0,This shirt was very thin and poorly constructed.
1.0,"Runs large, doesn‚Äôt wash easily."
1.0,"I am disappointed in this bag in its quality and design so much. Zippers are lute duty and their design insured when your bag comes out of luggage at least one zipper has opened and that‚Äôs on 20 flights...every time!!! Bad stitching on the zipper liners, side zipper is arched which makes it prone to open Very Easily, inside close strap are attached to the bottom of that bag instead of the sides so the structure of the bag hangs open...quality and design leave much to be expected...i thought i found an alternative for my FUL bag but this isn‚Äôt it and if you fly a lot this won‚Äôt last"
1.0,Broke them trying to straighten the right temple/arm before realizing the hinge itself was crooked. Never worn
1.0,It says it's M but it fits as if it was an xlarge on me
1.0,"Cute shirt but runs small. I washed it once in cold water, hung it to dry and it shrank about 2 sizes!  I was so disappointed."
1.0,It isn‚Äôt a wrap.  It‚Äôs a regular dress sow together all around .  I bought it thinking it was a wrap.‚òπÔ∏èDesapointed
1.0,The balls don‚Äôt screw on tight enough to stay together on the ear. I lost a few earrings already. Also some of the pieces aren‚Äôt even earrings just metal rings that are very flimsy
1.0,I have literally just with this the first time today and it fell apart with 4 hours of use and I'm at a desk job. Nothing crazy it strenuous or that could potentially damage it snag the cord. I'm disappointed with this product due to the polycarbonate card holder I have from them is awesome I expected the same
1.0,The dress pattern is cute but if you have any boobs the top becomes very small and awkward looking. The skirt part attached to the elastic is not down properly and looks awkward as well.
1.0,"I bought these because the seller states in description multiple times that these pants are made out of a cotton blend. In the questions and answers, they state that thry are 95% cotton. This is totally and comepletely untrue. They contain ZERO percent cotton. They are 90% polyester and 10% spandex. What a waste of time and money. DO NOT buy from a company like this that flat out lies to its customers."
1.0,See through and flimsy.
1.0,This bracelet was beautiful I brought it as a Christmas present for my sister. However after less than a week the silver turned to a nasty red color and she wasnt even wearing it on an every day basis.
1.0,Did not keep the time. I suspect some type of mechanical problem.
1.0,Not even close to regular American sizing. Way too snug for my American breasts!
1.0,I don‚Äôt know how this fits since I didn‚Äôt try it on. It‚Äôs advertised as 95% cotton but it is obviously cheap looking polyester. I will be returning promptly. What a hassle that you can‚Äôt rely on the product details on Amazon to be accurate!
1.0,I bought these for a gift for my daughter.  These were horrible.  The quality was terrible.  I was ashamed to even gift them.  Please do not buy these.
1.0,"That when you pull one thread, the whole thing becomes unraveled and you're standing there naked.  That's this sweater. Does it feel nice and soft, sure.  But that's where the good times stop.  I've had it for a week.  And it arrived with both pockets having holes.  Which, I guess for the price, isn't that bad as I know how to use a needle and thread.  But then it all started to come apart, literally.  The zipper is separating from the material and there are more holes in seams.  Save your money and get something that will actually cover your body for more than 1 week."
1.0,"Fabric is lightweight and not bad for a costume, but Stitch‚Äôs face is jacked up! The sides are misaligned but the fatal flaw is the ear flaps sewn in the middle of the eyes."
1.0,I bought this to wind my self wind watches but it doesn‚Äôt work
1.0,I got bright green not dark green color.
1.0,This was an awful purchase. These are literally just t shirts that are poorly cut with scissors and called ‚Äústringers‚Äù they fit awful. Do not buy. I train and where stringers from all types of brands and have never had ones fit this bad. I could‚Äôve cut my t shirts up and they would‚Äôve fit better on top of not spending money lol
1.0,It's for a preteen
1.0,"Coat seems like it is a good value for $30. I ordered a 3xl, when I opened it, tag said 6XL. The funny thing is I think it was actually a XL! Couldnt even get into to it. My other coats are 2xl but wanted some extra room for layers."
1.0,Cheaply made. Item appears to be irregular or flawed. Cheap material.
1.0,Already torn
1.0,I got a size 2X and could not get it past my ankles. Must be for kids. Maybe a woman size zero could wear the size 2X
1.0,These are very small not as listed large. Again if you need a large glove these will not fit the are very small. I gave them to tump sized hand people
1.0,"I was so excited for this sweater to come and when I pulled it out of the package I just laughed.  It was so short!  Basically a crop top.  The sleeves weren't even long enough to reach my wrists.  I usually wear a size small and that's what I ordered.  Even if I'd sized up to a large or xl I doubt this would fit the way it looks in the pictures.  The stripes were cute but the material was cheap.  I was so disappointed because the picture is super cute.  Don't get this sweater, does not look cute or like it is advertised to look."
1.0,They fit over my prescription glasses.  They are great to use except they snapped in half.  I was being careful since this was a comment made by other reviewers. The plastic is very brittle.  I will look for a different manufacturer.
1.0,"It came in folded so now all sides are not straight, they look clumsy. Not what I was expecting that was in the description. Not happy at all."
1.0,"so bad, i hate it"
1.0,This set was very disappointing due to the cheap fabric. i had to return it.  LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTO.
1.0,This item is very cheaply made my son asked for it for christmas and it broke it one day
1.0,"This product is lovely, just the down side is that is totally transparent. It did not work for me at all."
1.0,The pants have a more loose fit then in the picture and are more of a high rise then I like. The print on the pants was supposed to be camo and looks nothing like the picture!
1.0,"There is a seam at the top of the toe. If your child complains about seams at the toe, they will probably complain about the seam at the top of the toe. Photo for reference."
1.0,I ordered a size large and it fit my petite 13 year old niece.  I was so glad that they arrived so quickly.  I thought ‚ÄúGreat.  I have them on time to start going to the gym next week!‚Äù.  How disappointing to open the package and see how small they were.  Fortunately they fit my niece and I don‚Äôt have to send them back.  Very disappointed.
1.0,This product is completelly useless and does not perform as advertised. It definitely does not create the allusion of shapliness.
1.0,came broken !! =(<br />tuned green the next week<br />wore it twice
1.0,The neck fits like a stretched turtleneck sweater and the arms are way to big you have to wear something over your bra or it will show
1.0,The front pocket was sown on crooked. I initiated an exchange. So I returned the one I had the day of back in November. To this day I haven‚Äôt recurved a replacement or a refund for this.
1.0,The worst float ever<br />Terrible<br />What a waste of time and money
1.0,"This dress has a nice pattern pretty lovely, although cake with a big hole on the dress pocket. Super disappointed about this.."
1.0,"It‚Äôs fall apart while I am trying to wear it, I don‚Äôt how to fix it, because I saw a note state this is not Eligible to return."
1.0,"The size was too small and my girlfriend has a small ankle, broke when stressed too much"
1.0,Had to return dress was too big for a size small
1.0,This suck!!
1.0,"Received a powder horn from this seller. It was shipped only in a padded envelope, (totally inadequate) and arrived scratched and the cap broken off.<br />Also the leather strapping was very thin and of poor quality. I returned the item and bought another elsewhere of far superior quality for the same money as this poor quality powder horn."
1.0,I ordered two pairs of these. In the pics the shorts look thin and soft - but the fabric was thick and uncomfortable.
1.0,Item has holes in it.
1.0,The metal disks were very small the engraving with smeared to appoint you could not even recognize the Greek letters. It was a complete waste of money and had I not become very ill I would have asked for a refund
1.0,This bracelet is way to big and will not bend to fit my wrist.
1.0,"I bought it because my first impression was like &#34;it looks cool&#34;, but for my suprise the product was very small, the sizes was like for a child"
1.0,La talla no es correcta
1.0,Well you definitely get what you pay for which was 1.99 and they look like they came out of a gum ball machine.
1.0,Ordered black and received white
1.0,The hoodie I received isn‚Äôt the same brand as the one listed. Also the one I received has a tag on the font that I don‚Äôt like. Requesting a refund.
1.0,"I originally bought 2.00 reader safety glasses and these were ONLY safety glasses, VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
1.0,Very cheap looking.......
1.0,Pendent much smaller than the model was wearing in the picture.  It was about the size of a dime.  Poor quality chain and the clasp was to small for the necklace.  It was not worth the price.
1.0,"This apron is so small that the waist was at my breasts rather than my waist. It fit my 6 year old (in photo), so I kept it for baking with her."
1.0,It broke on day two
1.0,My daughters received these today - they are no where near aqua blue - royal blue and you can see the netting through the hair - save your money
1.0,Waste of money!!! Product was damaged when Itook it out of package. Feather was bent and way too long. Did not look like picture. Jewel on the side was completely missing.
1.0,For something that is advertised as gold (not plated) you‚Äôre so far off the mark!<br />I would have loved to keep it but it was already tarnished when I took it from the beautiful gift box.
1.0,"being white on the inside just looked strange to me. beautiful colors on the outside, though."
1.0,This is an Asian size Large. Order 2 sizes up. Nice jumpsuit but it was extremely small.
1.0,TOO LARGE and way TOO long almost came to my knees. Shirt was returned for refund
1.0,Terrible material and horrible shape. It is nothing like the picture.
1.0,"I bought these to use as nipple rings. I put them in, fine.<br />The ball came off the metal piece that screws onto the threading. So there‚Äôs an extra metal piece in the ball and that‚Äôs so irritating to a piercing. Anyways, it took me an hour to get them off, the metal piece stayed so it felt like my nipple was being gutted when I tried to remove it.<br />I‚Äôm still in pain, the entire right side of my body hurts.<br />Don‚Äôt trust these for nipple rings at all. Be super careful."
1.0,"Ordered a size 7, received a size 9. After submitting a return request, the message said seller would send a mailing/shipping label within 5 days. They did not but instead said it would be expensive for them to have them shipped back. Instead they said I can pay an additional $20 (after paying $90+ for these size 9s) to get the corrected pair or get 20% return plus get insoles to wear the boots that are two sizes too big. The last suggestion was to give them to a friend or family member.... I cannot make this up. Makes me think and feel the wrong size was sent on purpose just to make the sell and keep the money. Very unfortunate and extremely disappointing as the boots look nice and they were for my graduation..."
1.0,Returned. They sent me wrong item the picture shows sleeve length to the elbow I received very short sleeve . Thin material but I kinda liked the fit very figure flattering
1.0,Dress is disaster... got something else only.. Picture and dress are not matching at all. returning on the same day itself
1.0,I got what looks to be grease on my
1.0,Ok I was suppose to get it jan 16th I bought it December 3rd it is now the 24th of jan and I still haven't seen it contacted the seller and they gave me a tracking number that no one seems to have any information on this has been way more aggregation than it's worth and if I could redo my purchase I would find a different seller. I honestly wouldn't give one star but you have to. Use another seller
1.0,"Ordered this shirt, when it arrived it had two thick black stains on it that did not come out with washing."
1.0,"I only had the shoe for 30 days. Shoes does not last over 30 days, the bottom leaks in water and wear out."
1.0,Product was returned.  Product was to long in fingers and hands.
1.0,This outfit looks cute but seems to sized for a child. I ordered a large and would actually need to size up 2 or 3 sizes to fit an adult large. I returned
1.0,The dress is beautiful but it was too small.
1.0,Knock off garbage.  It's not made of the same material as the original.  Probably my fault that I didn't read the fine print.
1.0,"It looks like magnetic hematite, but it's not. If all you want is a pretty black earring, this is nice enough. But if you want real hematite, look elsewhere. Also, came in flimsy packaging so that the earring backs were destroyed during shipping."
1.0,So so so small
1.0,"The mask looks good in the pictures. But, there is no way it can be worn for more than 30 seconds...It flattens your nose and is a very hard plastic.. Do not buy."
1.0,The material is very thin. The seam tore the first time I wore them to class.
1.0,"Pants were rough material and ran small, t-shirt was cotton but also ran small"
1.0,"Disappointed  really.  They aren't even sewn well. There's a weird, uneven  widows leek thing going on with the ones I got. Plus, maybe I have a small head, ( I really don't ) but they don't fit tight at all. I had to keep pulling it out my eyes when I used it."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Bright orange sole (hunting clothing orange)
1.0,Cheaply made. Ripped same day.
1.0,Terrible fit. It looks nothing like the picture that is posted. Difficult tonwear on as well.
1.0,"Don‚Äôt waste your money. Ordered this twice. First time, the pink rope fell off while I was hiking. Returned it to Amazon and received a replacement. Fell off again. Just don‚Äôt even bother, this is cheap."
1.0,"With the memory foam in the description I really expected them to be more comfortable. There must have been a very thin piece of memory foam in the sole.  My worn out Walmart house shoes feel better than this. they are nice and warm, but i really wanted something that would be comfortable wearing in the house.  Just got them today and ready to send them back.<br />I guess it is back to the drawing board on finding a different pair of comfortable house shoes.-----------<br /><br />UPDATE: THESE HOUSE SHOES DID NOT EVEN LAST 2 MONTHS. THEY HAVE BIT THE DUST AND ARE NOW IN THE TRASH. I WILL NOT BE BUYING FROM THEM AGAIN."
1.0,"BUYER BEWARE: Worst purchase I‚Äôve made in a while. Cheap garbage. You can find a better product from a single use Halloween store. It looked so tacky and everything was fraying.  Only buy this if you want to turn somebody OFF.<br />Would give ZERO STARS, but I had to give at least one. Spend the extra money and get something that looks better and will last longer."
1.0,You have to wash this t-shirt separately. Not buying then again.
1.0,Problem only wore it for a week can't keep time and then it stopped working
1.0,"39.5 cm is about 1-1/2"" wide (girth)....too small for my 6-3/4"" wrist...get it together sellers...we need circumference measurements in bracelets  or length if bracelet opens up and lays flat...  nice looking bracelet...wanted to buy it but too small and no other sizes offered.."
1.0,This is nothing. 2 pins and 2 blocks that aren't even necessary to replace the band. $64 is Ridiculous for $6.00 worth of crap. Pictures Show a Band and the price suggest a Band is included. Shame!
1.0,"I ordered the pink color and it was absolutely see through. Even though I ordered two sizes larger than I usually wear, the shirt cling to my midsection in a really unflattering way. I tried layering with a cami underneath, but the rubbery shirt rubbed it and caused the cami to ride up so my white belly was visible plain as day through the shirt. Had to return."
1.0,"This cheap DW rip of is a complete joke. DO NOT BUY THIS, it is not as shown in the pictures and it is already falling apart after a couple hours of wear. Really disappointed especially because I only bought this, because it at the time had almost 5 stars and not a single comment about being a direct copy of a brand"
1.0,This product is absolutely horrible.  It looks exactly like a night gown.  Cheap material and flows just like a nightgown.  Cannot wear outside.
1.0,This apron is much shorter than pictured and the fabric is very thin.
1.0,"Everything, cheaply made way to big just junk"
1.0,"Cut wrong on most, cheap & crappy materials. Easily damaged & ripped"
1.0,"It's not true to size,doesn't stretch."
1.0,It screwed up my 22k pure gold bangles. thank god i had started from the inside.
1.0,Horrible cheap fabric
1.0,Very disappointed with the color.  The shoes that arrived look nothing like the picture.  They are very dark in color.
1.0,This item was returned. It did not stay up and was VERY thin.
1.0,"I really like the quality of the sweatshirt - its fluffy and warm! However, the print on the sleeves are printed on the INSIDE  crook of the arms, not the OUTSIDE so to see them, you need to hold your arms out in front of you with your palms up. ALSO the print on the right sleeve is a mirrored version (so Haikyu!! is backwards). It's upsetting because I had such high-hopes for this sweatshirt since I love Haikyu!! so much. The main print on the chest seems to be fine."
1.0,Just received today. So disappointed. The clasp is terrible. Junk. Will not stay fastened. Keeps popping open. Sending back
1.0,looks like a refurbished item ..product is not matching
1.0,I'm a size 8 and it's to small to go around my hips.
1.0,"So disappointed.  Loved the look, color, super soft feel and size, was a perfect light weight.  It wasn't hard to miss a single yarn that wasn't sewn for about 12 inches.  Sorry to have to return it as it hit all my needs."
1.0,I put it out for the first time...mild wind blew and snapped the tilt mechanism and fell on my head with a hot cup of coffee
1.0,"its made for medium sized hands, so it didn't work for me {small hands} or my boyfriend {large hands} the shape is awkward and stiff and it doesn't sit comfortable on the hand, the ring your finger goes through is thick and uncomfortable and doesn't sit correctly on the knuckle."
1.0,They snap in but don't fill the frame
1.0,I can't believe that Amazon is even selling this and promoting what that idiot did. He is a disgrace to the Alabama team and fan base. He does not represent what Alabama fans are. All this is doing is encouraging his criminal behavior. He is nothing to the tide and never will be!!!! Shame on you for selling this.
1.0,"Feels awful on and is too tight, I ordered the size I usually would order, the shoulders were too small. I didn't get a chance to return it in time, and now I'm stuck with something I cannot wear. - - My fault, I know. But to everyone who purchases it, you might want to try a size up. Having the top button, felt like it was going to choke me."
1.0,I work in very cold conditions the glasses are always fogging up where I cannot see. False advertisement very disappointed wasted of $11
1.0,Fell apart the first time I used it.
1.0,I loved this dress the 3 times I got to wear it. I followed the washing instructions and if faded terribly. I'm so bummed. It was a favorite. Poor material.
1.0,Very pretty..nice size..good materials..runs inconsistently
1.0,"Failed to work after a few days, made of cheap plastic, and makes terribly annoying noises whenever you press the wrong  button."
1.0,Loose and baggy and way too big.
1.0,Poor quality and does not feel nice. Main complaint is the fur sheds. Not happy with this purchase. Will probably return if I have time to go to the post office.
1.0,We returned them. Way too small.
1.0,after getting this for my fiance she asked to return it because its simply cheap and not worth the money.
1.0,This shirt was two sizes too small. I will be returning it and not reordering because I don‚Äôt want to play a guessing game with sizing.
1.0,False advertisement!!!! This is the second bag I have purchased through Amazon that is for a &#34;laptop&#34;.  I have been burned twice!!! This second time I try to put my avg laptop into bag and it doesn't come close to fitting!!! Don't waste your money.  Buy a bag in PERSON!!!
1.0,"Irritated my skin, half of them were like hella huge, and turned my nose green to top it off."
1.0,Not a nose ring way to big!
1.0,XXL & it's too short?!? I went up two sizes too... must not be fit for 5ft9in women..
1.0,"Band ‚Äòwas‚Äô nice. Not even two months and a lot of the camo coating has come off. From normal everyday wear. Not worth the money to last not even two whole months. Other than the coating, the band has remained tight.<br /><br />Update: band started falling apart after three months. Went to try to get my money back for overpriced junk. No luck."
1.0,üëéüèø
1.0,"I ordered a size medium after reading the other reviews.  I am 5'6&#34; and 128 lbs, and usually wear sizes 4-6 or Small.  Even the Medium was way too small.  I'm a 34A and the Medium smashed me.  And don't get me started on the skirt; on me it looked like a clown costume.  Maybe in the water it calms down, but I didn't care for it at all.  Returning."
1.0,Cheap junk. It looks cheap. It‚Äôs hard to tell if it‚Äôs plastic or metal. I‚Äôm leaning towards plastic. I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased it.
1.0,"Only wore these inside my home, on carpet mostly and they still ripped apart within 2 weeks. I'm not a big man nor did my pair fit wrong. No excuse and this was my third pair to blow out within the 2 WEEK mark. Never again!"
1.0,"Ordered M, it's my size  but,  it is too big"
1.0,From the second day was not working and dead!
1.0,I got so many compliments on the necklace but man does it turn! After first wear I was in love after second time wearing once I got hone and took it off it looked a bit tarnished the third time I wore it I had to take it off it was brass. No beautiful gold I was mad üò©
1.0,SOME CHOKERS WERE TOO SMALL FOR MY NECK
1.0,"It fits really really weird how is it to wide, but the waist area is really high I mean I really don‚Äôt know how to explain it üò¨"
1.0,There is no finishing of the seams on the outside of the tank top. Looks very cheap and will probably unravel after just a few washes. Definitely do not recommend (and I purchase a lot of tank tops through Amazon).
1.0,"I Like the way they fell but terrible quality, they broke after 3 months of use"
1.0,"was supposed to be for my kid, but was for a full sized adult"
1.0,The sleeves are tight and the cotton a little heavy.
1.0,Solo que es un poco caro y despues de dos meses el reloj paro de funcionar
1.0,"First of all: Delivered with (deodorant?) stains. Gross. See picture.<br />Secondly: There is no way this shirt is the flowy, long tank top pictured. Much too short and too tight."
1.0,This white is completely sheer. When requesting a refund they offered me a partial refund. I declined and they never responded nor did they refund me. Filing a claim.
1.0,"Not as nice as the pictures. Jesus is engraved on the cross, but he is cut off and you can't see all of him."
1.0,"I wanted a purple replacement band.  This was the only one available at Amazon that fit my watch.  In reality it is more an ox blood color than purple.  Brownish with a hint of purple in a bright light.  The old band was no longer usable, so at least I can wear it, but not with my purple clothes.  My spouse is the only one who thinks it is purple, but he thinks teal, turquoise and aqua are all the same color!"
1.0,This shirt seems very poorly made.  The stitching is so bad that the fabric doesn't lay well.  I returned it.
1.0,"I had to return the product. I could not fit it over my calves and the shoe portion felt cheap. It is a great looking boot but not practical. If I walked out in the heavy snow this boot would probably not make it. If the Seller makes a heavier boot with a solid insert, then I will purchase it."
1.0,The pictures are way blown up and distorted and they are way too big around to use as a mask. Don't buy them. They suck.
1.0,Not AT ALL CLOSE TO the color I requested... went with the blue camo and got green/grey camo. Very upset with this purchase.
1.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 115lbs, and the medium was way too tight. It's a stretchy, see through jegging material."
1.0,"Clasp never stayed shut to keep my badge on there, then the retractable mechanism broke after a few weeks of use. Sucks because it was cute."
1.0,Took forever to get to me. It‚Äôs like wearing hard plastic
1.0,Cheap crappy Don‚Äôt Buy!!! Falling apart as soon as I opened the package. If you pull slightly on the fabric the seams come apart. Would. Not last one use. Very small. Total junk.
1.0,This is not a hoodie!  It's a zip up turtleneck.<br /> I bought two. I am returning both shirts I ordered. Very disappointing because the colors are pretty.
1.0,The material and inner padding seemed wayyy too thick; the straps did too.  The bottom strap came lower down on my rib cage than I like it.  Overall it just seemed like way too much material and I felt like I would just overheat when working out.  Returned the items.  I really liked the colors so I wish it would have worked out.
1.0,Product is very thin quickly assembled; looks nothing like the picture. Must be returned to China for refund and the buyer pays the return shipping fees.<br /><br />Not worth it at all.
1.0,Poor quality broke the same day of use.
1.0,Turned my ear green after 4 days.
1.0,I liked the concept
1.0,"Runs very small, the material is very thin. The color was correct though."
1.0,Order description for ages not accurate at all it runs very small
1.0,"The band did not snap into place on the watch, so it was completely unusable.<br /><br />I gave it one star because 0 isn't an option."
1.0,I purchased them lately for my parents and in-laws to protect them from Blue Light and harmful glare (as advertised) but sadly after they arrived I have discovered that they are simply reading glasses with no Blue Light Blocking whatsoever. I have ran several tests on them (you can simply test them at home using a couple of online images) and found out that they do not block anything.
1.0,Waistline is too high. Doesn't fit right at all. Didn't return it in time so i'll give it to someone who might like it.
1.0,"Quality equals to zero, this item should be removed from the stock. Please don't buy you will regret"
1.0,I have several Myra Bags and have been very happy with the quality. However this bag was purchased in February and have used on one trip and it has a big hole in the bottom of the bag.
1.0,"Right out of the bag it looks great.<br /> It was missing a latch on one side.<br />The other latch won't latch on at all.  From past experiences with that type of latch I have learned that if you squeeze the middle part of the latch a bit it will latch on. So squeeze a little and try to see if it is not too hard to open.<br />Diamonds are pretty. (Cz) the size is not very believable unless you can afford a 30-40,000.00.<br />I am disappointed. I have bought other ones from different companies throughout the years here on amazon and they have always been great quality.<br />I think that now that amazon has grown so much they forgot about quality products!<br />Now they just let any company sell here!"
1.0,Not as expected the look wasn't pulled off the way I expected.
1.0,Does not fit the Five Squared even slightly. Don‚Äôt waste your time. I even went to Oakley to test these on a different pair and to no avail.
1.0,The operating system is horrible
1.0,Sent me a completely different dress and it‚Äôs so see through and the material looks cheap
1.0,Unusable. Ordered a size 2. They don't fit at all. Not a smooth surface either. Do not recommend at all.
1.0,"Made of cheap material and does not look sexy when you wear it like the picture,  had to return"
1.0,"The pattern finish is very close to that raised iron-on quality feel that most of us hate on cheap T-Shirts.  We wasted time (prewashing, washing, ironing) these to have something that is barely costume quality (one sided print, frayed edges after one wash) and would be a joke to use for a &#34;real&#34; bandanas.  They are fine if you can use without ever washing (although they do bleed - so keep that in mind if they might get wet.  Slight oily smell before washing.  I would try the cheaper ones at Walmart first if you are just looking for costume ones.  They deducted ten percent from the refund - not sure I've ever had that happen before when the quality was below par - I would have kept but not even good enough quality for us to justify using for rags."
1.0,I returned it to small!
1.0,"Don't fix..looks small,"
1.0,It did not fit the person I bought it for.
1.0,Smelled like cigarette smoke. Poorly put together and fits awkwardly. Will never wear it.
1.0,Very small!!
1.0,Received not what was pictured or discribed in description. Needless to say I returned them. Cut out for shoulder wasn‚Äôt as pictured.
1.0,"very poor material, ripping strings, ordered an extra large that does not fit a US size 33 waist and can barely get my feet through the leg holes. Just a really cheap product that does not sit very well either even on somebody for whom it does fit."
1.0,Stone fell out after two days of wear.
1.0,Mal√≠sima calidad para el precio q tiene es tela de pulloverüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
1.0,Nothing like the picture this is a streatchy fabric and looks like a sack.
1.0,"Listing says 60/40 polyester and cotton, it‚Äôs 100<br />Percent cotton, also the fit looks<br />Super short for a large.  Lacked quality."
1.0,Lack just feel apart into pieces first time I tried to put it on. Waste of time and money
1.0,Jamas llego al destino del comprador
1.0,poor quality not what I expect
1.0,The material is peeling already! Thumbs downüôÅ
1.0,"Does not work for nose snorers.  Does not stay on, unless stapled to head."
1.0,Is this really silver???? Turned my daughter's finger green within 24 hours?!?!
1.0,"""Moon phase"" watch does not display moon phases. Don't be conned."
1.0,It's so see threw very thin  material...
1.0,These are not a good every day earring. The  clasp won't stay closed.
1.0,Ugly. Heavy and was shocked at the gross fabric. Weird color.
1.0,There fit of this is too short. Was fine everywhere else. But didn't even come down to my belt line.
1.0,This top was poorly made. The fit was terrible!
1.0,way way to small didn't match the sizing chart at all
1.0,The earrings are nice looking.  The post only lets you screw the backing up a short distance.  This makes the earring fall forward and several people tell me my earring is about to fall off.  The backing is so small it is difficult to put the earrings on.  They are a closed backing so you can't fit the earring to tighter fit even if the post had been etched more for screwing the backing on tighter.
1.0,Very thin and see-through
1.0,"Well if the manufacturer had used larger, more clairvoyant photos of his product I might have recognized the design was an iron on cheap skin patch that was so thin you could still see the hat material below. This hat would not last a week under normal washing wear and tear before falling apart. I purchased this hat for a veteran in my family and was really looking for the quality of an embroidered patch. Do yourself a favor and go to an military base or local military organization and get the real thing. This is a rip off and deceiving and not worthy of giving to a veteran who served in both conflicts."
1.0,it broke while putting it on.
1.0,I purchased this item for my wife. Unfortunately it was much too large for her wrist with all possible links removed. She is an average sized American woman.
1.0,Broke the second time I wore them.  Nothing rough happened.  I took them off and they fell apart.  Terrible quality.
1.0,Not worth the money. Would not buy again.
1.0,I didn't like the look of the shoe when it arrived.  I didn't even try them on both pair I requested to have them returned.
1.0,The item didn't fit and the company didn't allow ample time for me to return it.
1.0,Returning. This is a cheap printed tee on what seems like shiny dry fit material. Not cotton what so ever.
1.0,"Eleg√≠ las mismas medidas para 3 pantalones y me enviaron una media por cada color, uno me queda super peque√±o y los otros dos super grandes, no obstante a eso mientras intentaba ajustar la cintura se abrieron en ambos huecos, son de muy mala calidad"
1.0,"Cheap quality. Tangled all together when arrived. Looks discolored. Very disappointed. I was going to put it in my teenage daughters Easter basket, she‚Äôs in to pineapple themed items, but it‚Äôs already falling apart after I got it de tangled. Do not waste your money."
1.0,It is too tight in the stomach area
1.0,"I was so excited to wear this dress to a fall baby shower and out for date nights and girls trips, but when it arrived I was disappointed. The material was not breathable and very scratchy, the buttons (which was one of my favorite features;) did not function, which meant the slit at the front of the dress was shown shut all the way to the hem. Also, the chest area was tighter than the waist and skirt making it hard to raise my arms and was just overall too tight to be the care free dress that was pictured. I returned it as am so disappointed that it didn‚Äôt live up to my expectations."
1.0,Recieved with many broken and count was not correct!
1.0,"This beard hat was supposed to be a gift for a friend. The tiny almost shriveled looking yarn of a beard was of no value. Thankfully Amazon accepted my return for a defective item. Either the item was defective or this beard hat is just poorly made. I have not one good thing to say about this product.<br /><br />_Bottom Line_ No, I would not recommend this to a friend."
1.0,"I am not happy with this watch.  I specifically bought it to be able to tell what time it was during the night when I would wake up.  The lighting feature is poor, next to useless.  I remember when these watches backlighted the entire screen, making them easy to read.  This one does not do that - has a light over at one side that only lights enough to see what hour it is - can't read the entire watch face.  Very poor, and I am greatly disappointed."
1.0,After 1 year 1 of the 2 motors stopped working. It is really disappointing the low quality of this product.
1.0,Losing color on the belt buckle and also on the belt itself
1.0,Too thin.... never wore them
1.0,I bought these over the summer because they looked so cute the forgot about them till today.<br />The images are nothing like the picture. They‚Äôre super distorted and don‚Äôt even line up right. When you put them on they get even more distorted because this dark color is printed on white.<br />They‚Äôre also not compression socks and the dot could not be much worse. They bunch in the front of the ankle and the foot is loose. Plus they‚Äôre a crew sock. What kind of compression sock is a crew sock?
1.0,Hopefully you can tell that the elastic has been folded and stitched over. Is it suppose to be like that normally? In my opinion that does not look comfortable for all day wear. Sent them back.
1.0,Doesn't fit to size. Way too small. Difficult to return.
1.0,"Very disappointed with sun glasses, it‚Äôs not what description says don‚Äôt like them"
1.0,Cardboard earrings - really cheap = not worth fifty cents
1.0,Arrived in plastic wrap with both posts broken off. Have to go find proper glue to glue together.
1.0,"My wife and I really wanted this dress to work out, but like a previous reviewer it came in and was super big, like a poncho and not cut to fit like the picture. We would love to order this again if it actually fits and was cut the way its suppose too.  The good part is the material feels great! Its lite and soft; but not to thin. Its thin enough to feel good to the touch."
1.0,I broke mine.  I did not realize it was so delicate.  The belt is beautiful.
1.0,"I have purchased four of these very nice looking watches, one about a year ago.  It worked well for the year and when it failed recently I bought another. When that one didn't word, I returned it. Then I saw where the price of the<br />watch had been significantly, so I repurchased two (an extra in case of failure. However neither of these watches<br />worked."
1.0,"Item material was cheap quality, did not resemble picture at all. Very disappointed."
1.0,The problem was that it was way to small. It runs small for its size. Color was wonderful true to what it showed online. So yay for that! But I was not happy with it. I have it to a friend who is much smaller than I. And it fit nicely on her.
1.0,The watch stopped working 2 weeks ago... I've been to busy to return it.. I'm very dissaponited.
1.0,Absolutely beautiful.  Unfortunately the second time I put them on the arm fell right off the glasses.
1.0,Very Sleek and comfortable but breaks easily now it is tearing away from the leather. Completely useless now. It will break off of watch in a day or two from now.
1.0,Too Small; nice design BUT Asian size beware
1.0,"Material is very poor quality, the pleats were slanted and it started to fall apart before I ever tried it on."
1.0,This product is Cheap in quality! I should have known given the price. They are so thin. It has no support. I have had plenty of shape wear and this is aweful
1.0,Crap do not buy broke within an<br /> hour
1.0,"It was so small I could barely make out the name ""BELLA"" on it. Had to actually use a magnifying glass to read it. Would have sent it back but sadly it's too close to Christmas now."
1.0,"I ordered a pair of these sunglasses that were a Lightning Deal on Amazon.  The sunglasses arrived today and when I opened them up, one of the nose pieces was severely bent.  The frames in general were not even, but sort of crooked.  These sunglasses are of very poor quality and workmanship.  For the brief minute I tried them on, the lenses did seem to be very crisp and clear.  I regret this purchase and cannot in good conscience recommend these sunglasses to others.  I am returning these sunglasses for a refund."
1.0,Do not buy this jacket! My package came in the mail today and mikasas leg is faded! This was a waste of money!
1.0,Shirt moves and shows bra unexpectedly
1.0,way to small. do not like these socks.
1.0,"I am very disappointed in this item. The first week 4 of the snaps came off and I had to resew them on. The problem with this coat is the snaps, if you move at all they come on snapped which makes this item useless to keep you  warm. If the snaps were buttons it would be perfect, but if  you have a coat that you cannot keep closed what is the point?<br />Wish I never would have purchased this...."
1.0,I like the fabric and the look. I do not like the fit.
1.0,"Purchased a small and this dress is much, much too big for me.  Verdusa - Really?  Return address on package was Mr. Liu in China.  It came in a used plastic bag that did not look clean.  Kind of creepy.  Dress went straight into the washing machine.  Hope I can find someone who can wear this dress because I definitely can't."
1.0,Worse buy ever!
1.0,No es √∫til
1.0,"I ordered the large which just about fit a size 7.5-8 foot, so these run extremely small. Any average foot will need a large. I'm not sure what happened to Sheec, but their slingback toe socks are not a fraction as good as the older products (no longer available, that I can see). And this product is far too expensive. This slingback broke as I pulled one foot out of a shoe. and--as in all the new Sheec slingbacks--the toe sock is still too small.  I most definitely do not recommend it. It would be great if Sheec returned to their older style, non-slip, slingback...but I'm afraid they just won't. I DON'T recommend the purchase, too expensive, too poorly designed."
1.0,"I am 5f.5in tall and 160pound, I ordered the jean pant of 32w and 30 L that perfectly fitted to my body. I love the pant very much, I wish to buy more when I have more money"
1.0,"Fell apart in one day, dont even know where the pieces are anymore..."
1.0,stole design from charlieandclaires
1.0,"The product was not long enough, cheaply made, and hung towards the back. Horrible purchase and fit."
1.0,"Unless you have small boobs OR your boobs squish together directly in front of you, this dress is a no go.  I was so excited until it gave me side boob for days.  Sad."
1.0,"Not even the same dress. The color matched, that is literally it."
1.0,"Purchased this for My dad who just got a Corvette. Opening it, it was all fogged out like it has already been used. Then there was scratches and dents all over it as well. Disappointed in the purchase, you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Wasn‚Äôt flattering, didn‚Äôt fit as expected"
1.0,I want to return it so bad. It's only been a few days since I had it. I still didn't even rip open the plastic it was held in.
1.0,"Very cheap, came tarnished. The links were open. Angers me mire because i accidentally bought It.. decided to give It a try once It was already processed!"
1.0,Save your money and spend it with a BLACK OWNED brand. This company originally advertised with a non melanated woman then photo shopped her skin to be darker. I took a screenshot weeks ago because I thought it was bizarre they weren't using a black woman for advertising. Hope this saves someone's coins!
1.0,"Gloves in general mediocre, the thumbs are 3 sizes too small. Gloves are unwearable."
1.0,"This honestly doesn‚Äôt look like the photo much, the face is very flat and looks bad. The nose is also stitched on sideways... it also sheds really badly and I cut my hand on the key ring part. Not a happy customer here"
1.0,Fits funny and it looks really cheap
1.0,"I wear a 16 in real life so I ordered a 3X because I wanted them to be super baggy and comfortable and according to the website size chart they should have been.  When they arrived I was absolutely astounded! The waist is about 12 inches wide, hips might be 24 inches wide in a 3X .... the x must mean something else to this seller."
1.0,Part of it broke right away..not happy
1.0,Will not clip in and I‚Äôve been trying for about a half hour. Don‚Äôt seem to be great quality as they already look tarnished.
1.0,The chains will pop in the thigh area as soon as you sit down. I got these for my daighter and she‚Äôs a size 2. They are a little loose in the waist but otherwise they fit nice...until you try to have a seat. The chains are not attached well and there‚Äôs no stretch for you to have a seat. The chains popped on each leg in the thigh area as soon as she sat down.
1.0,Bah
1.0,I ordered one and was very disappointed to find it was made in China although advertised as Peruvian.
1.0,To small because I can t figure out how to do the sizes
1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy these. Look great, but lenses are horrible. Seems like the prescription is only a dime size section in the center. It‚Äôs like looking through a funhouse mirror all the time. The first set I purchased had this issue, so I replaced. Second set had the same issue."
1.0,I followed the size guidelines and the suit was too small. Approximately 2 sizes too small
1.0,"When I first received this, I was excited because it is very pretty. The reason I gave it 1 star is because after 2 wears, it turned very dark."
1.0,"Product is cute and fits nicely, but I‚Äôve worn it twice and it‚Äôs already torn. It ripped right at the shoulder and I‚Äôm going to have to throw it away which is disappointing. What a waste of money!"
1.0,I revived this product and went to put it together and one of the clasps came off right away.
1.0,"Toe stitching came apart after 2 or 3 wears. I would return them, but my son filled them with bark. Very difficult to remove from fluffy lining."
1.0,Wwaayy too big for normal ear piercings
1.0,Overpriced rubber band
1.0,Cheaply made. Right nose piece fell of the first time I wore them.
1.0,I only received the skirt and it looked nothing like this!
1.0,"Not good product, flimsy clip that would not adhere to eyeglasses ...."
1.0,"This product is not as pictured. I ordered 4 of these: 2 green, 1 light blue, 1 black. The badge portion is the same texture as the picture, but not the same colors. The green is not lime green but more of an emerald/turquoise tone. The lanyards are not the same color as the badges (see photos) both the green and the blue lanyards are noticeably darker than the badge. The product shots in Amazon show the lanyards being the same material as the badge and they are not. You can even see a seam, but the ones I received are just a thin, cheap-looking plastic."
1.0,"After just a very few uses the stitching began to fray.  After one months use, the belt's cosmetic appearance was so poor, it had to relegate its use to outdoor and work related jeans and work pants.  My attached pictures tell all."
1.0,Horrible dress does not look like the picture at all.
1.0,Size is no where near accurate.
1.0,"This is my fourth pair of Bed|Stu shoes, and I've always loved the products. On this one, however, after barely five weeks of light usage, the sole of one boot just peeled away from the rest of the boot. The stitching disintegrated. I don't know if someone forgot some glue, or what. This isn't typical of my experience, so I contacted Bed|Stu customer service to see about repair or replacement. They only do it by email. The first service rep I got connected with was super helpful and asked me to send photos, which I did. That was a month ago. Since then I haven't heard a peep from them. I've followed up a number of times and even opened a new ticket, and not one word in four weeks. At this point I'm going to take them to my local shoe repair place, which will probably cost as much as the boots did in the first place, and not buy any more products from this company.<br /><br />It's too bad, bc the boots are lovely, comfortable, and fit well, and they seemed high quality before the one fell apart."
1.0,"The shirt is definitely not worth the price,  the shirt was too small , material is thin and feels cheap , and shirt looks longer  on the picture than it actually is , very disappointed,  will be sending back"
1.0,Cheap garbage and material last one good day in the sun doing hard work. Better to buy something with more reviews and quality material. This garbage rips easily
1.0,"These socks are not true no shows, they show in every pair of shoes that i own."
1.0,Doesn't work like the picture at all. Difficult to manipulate.
1.0,"Not at all what I ordered.  The necklace I received was a single chain with pearls, not the multi-chain necklace that was pictured.  Very disappointing!  I will be returning!"
1.0,Cheap feel which was to be expected but its just blah. Returned it.
1.0,Totally see-through. Sent it back.
1.0,These boots look comfy and plush but they are thin and obviously very cheaply made. The boot is misshapen and they are so uncomfortable. they arrived in the package DIRTY and already scuffed. Do not buy.
1.0,"All the middle stones are almost black, JUNK"
1.0,Too smalll.  Bought for an adult and my slim 6 year old can wear it. Too much trouble and cost  to send back. The last time I buy from China.
1.0,"Beautiful design, but poorly made. Seams were all off...did not wear well."
1.0,This product broke the second day after I bought it. Very disappointed.
1.0,I like the pattern but it‚Äôs see threw
1.0,pretty on the model but totally not wearable. its completely see through.
1.0,"While the width is the right size, these keepers are soo tall that there is far too much space between the straps that it's rendered useless. Quality seems okay, but a keeper that doesn't ""keep"" is utterly pointless, especially for $1 a piece."
1.0,Difficult to put on without directions.  Ran kinda small.  I ended up not even using it.
1.0,"The material is not good dress material and because of the type of material used, it doesn't matter that I ordered a size up just in case. The pockets stick out and it looks funny. My plan is to sow the pockets shut just so I could at least try to wear it."
1.0,The fit did not match the size printed on item
1.0,The fabric is super thin. No weight to the fabric at all
1.0,"Like other cotton boyshorts I have bought, these tend to separate at the waistband. The quality is okay, but these are not panties that will last or endure daily wear and wash. I use them to support a colostomy bag, and they do a good job of covering and supporting the bag.<br /><br />My previous review is above. I ordered these a second time and ordered a large thinking they would fit since I ordered a medium last time and they still fit (I am a US size 10 in clothing). This order is awful! One pair was clearly a couple of sizes smaller than all the rest, and the larges aren't even as big as the mediums I had before. I can't even get on the smallest pair, and the pair I wore yesterday separated at the seams around the waistband after one wear. The gray color seems to always be smaller than the other colors, and I had two gray pairs in this shipment (including the one that was obviously smaller than the rest). With two gray pairs and one that separated after only one wear, I now have only half of what I paid for, and I haven't even worn the other three pair."
1.0,COLOR WRONG.  PICTURE MISLEADING.  i HATE THIS COLOR.
1.0,Got a larger size then suggested<br />It was way short<br />Then I eased it<br />I think my 8 year old granddaughter can use it now<br />I sew so I'm going to take off the lace piece and add it to another white shirt.<br />The model in the pic must be a size 0 and maybe 5 feet tall
1.0,"When my son put them on for his Halloween costume he had to take them off about 5 minutes later, he pulled them off and when he did the inside of the gloves got so messed up that I tried for an hour to put the inside of the gloves back in the holes where the fingers go and could not get it fixed. Needless to say he didn‚Äôt have gloves with his Halloween costume and he was very upset."
1.0,Good looking watch but they gave me a defected one the date wont spin all the way i just noticed it on my 2nd day of wearing it... im very dissapointed.
1.0,"This is fabric that is made to look embroidered but is not embroidered. Unfortunate, as it is not returnable.  Falsely represented!"
1.0,I ordered this same bracelet twice in less that one week and both times it arrived already broken (one side was not attached to the heart center). This is very disappointing because it is such a pretty bracelet.
1.0,"Cheap looking, but I was able to return it with no problem."
1.0,Not the same color as picture ! Nice had I just didn‚Äôt want the color not in the picture
1.0,Very small and the picture is blue with dark blue suede the pure that came is only one blue.
1.0,Looks unreal and cheap not as described.
1.0,t-shirt arrived on time. shirt was the size I ordered. However shirt is not even close to the color pictured I will keep shirt but I will never order from these people again.
1.0,Product description totally inaccurate. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
1.0,"If I were handy, I would have made this myself for 75 cents.  I knew it would be pretty basic, but for $6, I was expecting it to higher quality than this.  Very disappointing.  I would return it, but it hardly seems worth the effort.  But I am a bit shocked by all the good reviews.  Please see the picture of the handle.<br /><br />UPDATE - they have a no-return policy.  Do not buy this."
1.0,Feels like the same fabric used on cheap costumes and the straps kept sliding off my shoulders. I bought a size 4-6 when in reality I fit a size 8 and it was still loose. I originally bought it for a friend and she was even more disappointed. ‚òπüíî Never buying from this company again...
1.0,"Looked really cute right out of the box and color looks exactly as shown. I wore it once and loved it. Went to put it on this morning and there is a tear in the seam down the back of the shirt. It is a very baggy shirt - so it wasn't stretched or pulled to tight. It is just cheaply made. I wish I could return, but I just missed the window to send it back. Disappointed."
1.0,The first pair I wore literally fell apart in my ear when it wasn't even being touched and I wasn't doing anything.  It was pretty disappointing.
1.0,Very cheaply made.  The silver piece that connects to the pink leather strap gave away and all the beads literally went down the toilet!
1.0,Only one ring came in.. its so cheaply made but like they say you get what you paid for. Its a no go for me.
1.0,Not woman's size was child's size
1.0,Broken before I got it out of the box. Going back!
1.0,This product is made out of very thin bathing suit material. The stitching was haphazard when removed from package. The dress was very cheap looking; it obviously was very cheaply made. The dress was an awful fit it was as cut way too low yet landed at the waist. Was baggy in the waist and the pleating was matronly. Skip and avoid!
1.0,It was cheap and arrived broken.
1.0,It's way to small.  XXXL may be about a woman's size 2-4
1.0,"I‚Äôve only worn these leggings a handful of times. They are already pilling. I‚Äôve followed the wash instructions, but the quality of the fabric is not as expected."
1.0,This claims to be a LED light up mask‚Ä¶ this is a joke!! Nothing lights up and the sound of this thing is EAR PIERCING!!!!  Not worth the buy!
1.0,This purse fell apart. Non usuable
1.0,The quality of the hat wasn't what it looks like in the picture when I got it... It looked ised
1.0,Shorts that were received were labeled 2XL but were clearly not.  They were between an adult medium and large.  Nice shorts for the price but poorly labeled for size.  Had to return for refund.
1.0,First pair only one lens darkened. Sent back for another pair. Second pair both lenses barley darkened at all. Don‚Äôt even use for sunglasses.
1.0,Within the first month the black bled onto the white and it became very dirty looking. Eventually in the first 3 months it broke.
1.0,I was very narrow
1.0,It Does Not Come With The Paw Feet At The Bottom
1.0,I tried to show this off to someone and learned that the cool design was only on the inside. It's a weird black plastic material on the outside! The packaging was over the top and cool.
1.0,This hat is not worth the price it‚Äôs something you would buy at a 99cent store. Not worth the price I was expecting more from this seriously don‚Äôt buy unless your putting on a stuff animal
1.0,Very cheaply made with awkward fit.  They look great in the pic but feel like dollar store slippers.
1.0,Cheaply made.  Will not buy this brand again
1.0,Broke after less than 3 weeks of use.
1.0,These were way too big for my child.
1.0,"Look good but fall apart after few weeks of daily wear. All pastic construction fails at pivit point, makes them un usable."
1.0,Dress was see-through. Wanted something that I didn't have to wear leggings with.
1.0,This product needs to be pulled from Amazon. I wore it to sleep and woke up to this amulet stuck to my sweatshirt like a used lollipop and it REAKED of urine. I'm almost positive it's made of male urine. I am absolutely disgusted with Amazon and this product.
1.0,Already missing eyelets
1.0,"These where tiny, almost like doll glasses. Much to small for my toddler. Glad they where cheap so I'm not out much money. My son put them on his teddy bear."
1.0,"I ordered a large and was sent a 3XL.  It probably was true to size for a 3 XL. It was an easy return, I just took it to Kohl‚Äôs and was done. I liked the color and material."
1.0,No spandex at all
1.0,Terrible product.  Wouldn‚Äôt open properly and very confusing. Just had to throw it out
1.0,metal
1.0,Very cheaply made and price reflects it.
1.0,I bought these for a photography project involving reflections.  There is no reflection... how can they be called &#34;mirrored&#34;?!
1.0,"Bad workmanship - I am returning this right away.<br /><br />The hat is not made for an adult - my dad has a small head for a guy and this had to stretch to it's absolute limits to be pulled on - to the point where there were big holes in the knitting.<br />The back seam is crooked.<br />The buttons, to connect the beard piece were completely wrong. When the hat was laid flat on the table, with the back seam &#34;dead center&#34;, one button was on the front of the hat and another was on back of the hat. This forced the beard to be crooked on the face to the point where one of the mustache points had nowhere to go but up a nostril.<br /><br />This is a very disappointing purchase. We needed this hat to fit for a funny family picture."
1.0,Didn't really like it and was to big
1.0,"I was sadly disappointed with this dress! It was suppose to be bodycon and it‚Äôs not true to size! It wasn‚Äôt flattering anywhere on my body,so I‚Äôm definitely returning this dress!"
1.0,not good for several keys.....doesnt spring back to original shape.....returned with no problems
1.0,Super thin. Returned
1.0,"I've purchased many versions of these knockoff sunglasses, but these are by far the worst. Lenses loose in the frames (yes, even when seated in the groove in the frames), poor overall quality on the frame mold. It's telling that they don't allow returns."
1.0,Definitely a 1x or large not 2x
1.0,I didn‚Äôt even get to wear it once it broke as I was putting it on! Wtf! It‚Äôs so cute so disappointed. Don‚Äôt waste you‚Äôre money
1.0,"I am an average size person, but these Dickey collars were so tight they  honestly felt like hands around your neck choking you. The opening is SO small the material they are made out of rubs around your neck and burns every time you move your neck back and forth or up and down all day. I ended up stretching everyone of those collars over a kettle from my kitchen to widen the opening. The material aways looks bunched up and wrinkled, and the collar is so tight it curls down. This is a really bad product."
1.0,"I don‚Äôt know if this is supposed to be a gag gift? It is thick, skin tight, and barely stretches and has NO breathing holes for mouth or nose!! I almost had a panic attack trying to get it off my face realizing I couldn‚Äôt breathe AT all in it!! Bad bad bad!! This was for my 10 yr old!!"
1.0,"Save your money. This is a piece of junk. The fit is odd, a little short, a little wide, sleeves are odd. Mine was missing the cuff on one sleeve."
1.0,Bad not comfortable at all I will not use it
1.0,I ordered them for a few men in the Masonic Lodge
1.0,Very small . Only come slightly over ankle
1.0,"Do NOT buy! I just checked this thing out and I wouldn‚Äôt even buy it if it was $50. Seriously, this a total rip-off."
1.0,"If I knew it was from china I wouldn't have ordered it.  This is not a adult size its a small child size, very thin material. I don't think it would keep anyone warm.  Very disappointed. I would give it no stars."
1.0,It's made how mask started out when the pandemic first started with the pleats.  I don't care for pleated mask. Also it's way to big cheap material.  I would return even though I had not tried it on. I'm not due to it being a mask I just have to take a L on this one. Smh
1.0,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, we live now overseas, such a disappointment the whole left sleeve was torn quality control at its best I was so ashamed"
1.0,"Heal lining material is folded over, taking up room for heal. I could not adjust the excess material to allow my foot to slide in. I will say that I like the design, the buttons allow you to open the leg.  But I can't comment on Toe Box, Width or Arch support, because I could not get them on.  I need to return them."
1.0,the strap fell off after 1 time of wear.  and 2 pom poms were already fallen off when we got it.
1.0,Do not buy at all! Not worth the money at all! Very very very bad! Do not buy! It does not stick...And it does not stay in your mouth at all. Badly made.
1.0,"It is marketed as a ‚Äúgirls‚Äù bra. In my mind that means not a woman, and yet it has a Demi-cup that seems a bit inappropriate for a young woman. It Covered the side of her breast although it‚Äôs the cup size she normally wears.<br />I don‚Äôt consider myself or my parenting ‚Äúold fashioned‚Äù but, I don‚Äôt see the point of this type of bra marketed to ‚Äúgirls.‚Äù<br /><br />üìå‚ö†Ô∏èdƒìLiA please consider marketing and/or design options for girls and young ladies to have a full-support bra."
1.0,"The band does not fit on the gear 2, the attachment mechanism is not correct."
1.0,Cheaply made. Took a month and a half to get to me. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Cheaply made, fabric was coming off upon arrival."
1.0,"I purchased these cufflinks as a gift, and I was let down by the quality of their product. The cuff link themselves are a generic low end product, but the image quality of the decals was terrible. The photos provided are unrealistic, the areas which are supposed to be a grey? were greenish, and yellowing... shoddy quality.<br /><br />Save yourself some time, and headaches and look elsewhere for a nice gift idea."
1.0,The package is missing the bow tie and cummerbund that is listed in the product details. The only thing that arrived was the tuxedo shirt and cuff links.
1.0,Bought this for my daughter and took it out of mail package. Was very disappointed. Way smaller than what's advertised. Sorry this is false advertisement!!!! Sending back for refund
1.0,"These sun glasses came on time but they were junk, of course what do you expect for the price? So I guess that is my fault for thinking they would work for a quick pair of sunglasses. Highly recommend you saving your money and finding a pair of sunglasses much more quality."
1.0,Not what I expected at all.  Rather large and not this color at all.  These were actually ugly
1.0,"liked this purse alot, until I washed it. the liner simply fell apart...shredded. I have bought denim purses forever, mostly because they are washable.  Fair warning, this purse is not washable and the liner is much less than good quality."
1.0,very cheaply made.  so disappointed the words cannot describe how I feel.  I feel cheated out of $12 bucks for sure
1.0,This was supposed to be a gray outfit but it looks purple so unfortunately my grandson won't be able to wear it for my daughter's wedding. The color is way off.
1.0,I rinse it in cold water to get off wrinkles before I wear it. But it shrink a lot. I can‚Äôt wear it. I bought this one in June. It already passed the return date. It‚Äôs terrible experience.
1.0,Very disappointed dress I really wanted did no fit.  Please do better getting 3X size right.
1.0,Stone broke off in a week
1.0,I ordered these as part of a end of the school year gift for my students last year.  A lot of them were already broken when I took them out of the box.
1.0,"We loved The product for a couple of weeks.. It started shred.we tried to sew it back together, but it still didn't work..my granddaughters  heart brokenüò≠ can I get a replacement for her? It was only used about 8times.. I would appreciate any help you can provide me with.. thank you so much.. Melanie Ulicky.."
1.0,"Buy what you need and don't plan on using this months, or even weeks later. There are better, longer lasting products out there. In fact, I added some of this left over solution to some other that I had for over 10 years (still working) and it ruined the batch. I couldn't figure out what went wrong until I came back here and read the reviews."
1.0,"After a few times wearing these, they won't stay up."
1.0,Did not fit right and were not helpful. I did not like these socks.
1.0,"I just received this item from UPS this evening and opened them to find that the hoop and loop lace is coming unraveled and breaking off, this was not damage done by me they were shipped to me like this... i like the shoes and i want them replaced, disappointed that i cant wear them and there payed for already..."
1.0,Sizes are both true
1.0,"Do not waste your money.bought as a gift for my son.usually wears a 3xl..big,tall guy.so as described went one size up,! Waste of time & money.arrived,right away knew it was AWFUL.NOW I HAVE TO WAIT FOR PERMISSION TO RETURN.BEWARE. ZERO RATING"
1.0,This nightgown is paper thin and no where near the quality I expected. It will be fine for possibly two or three wears but I can't imagine it will last more than two washes. Also runs small.
1.0,"The material is not strong , was delivered btoken"
1.0,Lousy piece of toy masquerading as a watch. Poor customer service
1.0,I was so excited about buying this sweatshirt and it‚Äôs the worst quality ever. The material is cheap and thin. I ordered a medium but it looks like a small. It‚Äôs so cheap and not as pictured. It also smelled when I opened the package.. not worth it! Save your money!
1.0,The letters and words were faded and dingy. It looked like it had beem washed multiple times before I received it. Very poor quality. Faded picture and definitely not worth the price! Returned immediately!
1.0,Cardboard.  Would not wear.  Gave to kids to play with.
1.0,I didn't even get to use this more than a few days.  Magnet wasn't strong enough and the band kept slipping open.  Waste of money.
1.0,"this top is sold in one size only- it is NOT one-size-fits-all. This is a child-size top sold as  women's size. I could not button the top button in back! I am a medium sized woman and  there was a gap of 8 inches that could not be closed with the button! I can only imagine this fitting a flat chested, stick thin woman!"
1.0,"Didn't love the fabric, and fit did not look like what the bloggers wearing it showed.  It's much more boxy."
1.0,The poncho is too short...barely reaches my waist. The picture and description are misleading. The poncho is not made of cashmere.
1.0,Super frumpy.  Not figure flattering
1.0,I thought that this set would look like picture. Not at all!!! Lavender stone barely visible.  Pieces are tiny. Very disappointed. I placed a U.S. penny next to necklace and earrings for comparison. Hope this helps.
1.0,returned not even true to size.  returned
1.0,For kids I thought it was for adult it was too small for me had to give to lol cuz
1.0,Not what was advertised. Was given second pkg just as bad don't buy buyer beware. This company needs to be banned from selling on Amazon
1.0,"This is not NFL approved. I bought it specifically for a game and I wore it to a KC Chiefs game. They took it, saying it was not compliant."
1.0,No dur√≥.  Se rompi√≥.  Mala inversi√≥n
1.0,I liked the number of pockets but the zippers started sticking after 2 weeks so we returned it.
1.0,"I just received this dress in green color today and I'm speechless.<br />1. The color is great, but the lace design is atrocious. Imagine a doillie paper plate went rouge for this dress<br />2. I couldn't the zipper up because it got stuck. The zipper was already funny sound when I unzip it to begin with<br />3. Here is the killer, the doillie lace rubbed on my skin and it was super itchy!<br /><br />Shoppers, please take all of the 5 stars reviews from people that got the products free for exchange for their &#34;honest&#34; reviews with a grain of salt.<br />That is actually a job, people get paid to write good reviews!<br /><br />I'm returning this dress by the way."
1.0,"I read all the rave reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. And since it had such great reviews, I decided to buy 2 so I could alternate. When I opened the packages, I saw there were some odd stains on one of the wraps. The other one was not stained, so I'm not sure if I was sent a used one. I tried several times to put on the wrap, but each time, it immediately rolled up on itself and dug into my back. I am going to have to send them back. Super disappointed in this product."
1.0,There is no way this shirt is a 3x. Cute shirt but have to send it back. Only reason I gave it one star is because it is cute.
1.0,Not even worth $5
1.0,"I bought these because they were supposed to be compression tanks.  I bought XS because I wanted them to really be snug around my stomach. They are not even close to being snug. As a matter of fact they are loose. I am not a big person by any means,  but I am certainly not so small that they should be loose. I'm 5'3"" and weigh 115 lbs. I would not recommend these if you are looking for compression.  They are cute and I will wear them, but I will have to wear a tighter cami underneath."
1.0,Broke on delivery. Felt fragile and cheap
1.0,Came already running and soon did not run at all. One of the sets was floating around inside the watch face upon receipt.
1.0,"They said this was supposed to be marked down from $100+ and this is absolutely a $1 quality bag- super cheap, don't bother."
1.0,"A seam opened after one wearing within 2 days of receipt from Amazon. Also, these were worn by a 100lb 5'2 girl, minimal stretching. Seriously poor quality."
1.0,Took less than 2 weeks for them to break. The screws that keep them together almost immediately fell out as soon as i started wearing them.
1.0,"this thing was maybe 4"" wide"
1.0,Fell apart within weeks...not pleased at all.
1.0,"2nd time they sent me garbage, they will not clasp. Junk... dont buy"
1.0,"First one came as a pink scrunchie band, second one came as a rubber material NOT stainless steel. Terrible company, sends wrong products"
1.0,It's youths medium not adult medium. I returned product
1.0,I ordered purple and pink the ‚Äúpurple one came but it looks nothing like the photo are the other reviews have their shoes but where are mine?they look like concha‚Äôs
1.0,Not the material I thought at all. More of a tshirt dress
1.0,"This band sucks. I wanted a cute pastel color and this was the only one I found anywhere. ITS SO POOR QUALITY! I got mine less than aml month ago, and already had to throw it away. I wish I still had it to take pictures of; the quality feels gross, not at all nice like the real Fitbit bands, the 'metal' of the hook is just plastic, and the biggest issue is it gets dirty and gets stained! I couldn't clean mine off when it started turning black, I thought it was dirt-nope. Just started staining somehow from the desk i sit at, and my hand happens to lay on whole i work.<br />An actual waste of money. I had to throw mine away. And pushed out the money for the real deal Fitbit brand band-expensive but it will actually last longer than ONE MONTH!"
1.0,"Mala calidad en el punto de soldadura, se nota a simple vista, esta desalineado, osea mal acabado, los lentes tienen desajustado los soportes de la nariz, al colocarlo se ven de lado, no est√°n derecho, no vienen en un estuche sino bolsita, devolv√≠ el producto al momento que llego, no me gust√≥ su acabado dorado muy malo"
1.0,This shirt will make you look like a 70s pimp. The material/fabric is terrible. Please do not buy.
1.0,"This shirt is way too small. I'm not sure a nine year old would fit into this, let alone an adult. It is also very short. My entire mid-drift was showing. On top of all of those negatives, this shirt is made out of a see-through, cheap material. The only positive about this shirt is the picture online. Nothing was good or right about this shirt. I do not recommend buying this product."
1.0,Poor fabric quality. Seams weren‚Äôt smooth. Gave it away. I‚Äôll do better research next time.
1.0,The neck of the shirt is very wide and the shirt color is orange not pink
1.0,2 of stones fell out.
1.0,Much too small but very cute
1.0,Not a good quality shirt. On first wash the snap fell off...couldn‚Äôt return after washing.  Not a good product.
1.0,"The color looked totally different  than the band I received. I love the band itself, good quality and fit, but never would have selected this color."
1.0,It was way too small. And i got size L.
1.0,"yea... at 55, my body does have that classic triangular shape... just has the wider side at the waist and not the shoulders."
1.0,Power cord does not fit into the port on the battery. Very disappointing. Great quality jacket but for the price I'd expect everything to work.
1.0,"I ordered the 4 inch inseam shorts and they are only about 3 1/2 inches.  There is one small pocket.  I ordered large, but received a size 10.  Large is usually 12 - 14."
1.0,"LOVE these!!!  One fell out the first time I wore them.  It was an evening dinner occasion, and when I got home it was gone :(.  Lots of compliments though!"
1.0,"CAN I GIVE -100 STARS?<br />Honestly, one of my worst purchases to date. Upon opening a tiny sliver of the package, I notice how horrendous the fabric quality was. The fabric is of such a low quality I assure myself that if I were to wear it, I'd chafe immediately. Infact, if blind folded, I would think it is made out of tissue paper. Nevertheless, I was willing to overlook the texture until I pulled the remainder of the set out of its package. I consider myself thin on top and thick on the bottom. I expected the bottoms to fit snuggly around my butt area because it is quite an area to cover. For reference, in pants, I usually wear a size 12...and on a good day, I can squeeze into a 10. Per size chart suggestion, I ordered an extra large. This is the smallest extra large I have ever seen in my 19 years of living. Growing up, I had American girl dolls and the &#34;extra large&#34; that I was sent, would not even fit them!!!!!!!!! I am out of words to say, I hope nobody has to endure this pain ever again. And company, please allow the future customers ample pictures of what really shows up to the porch!!!!!"
1.0,Returned this it wasn‚Äôt at all as appeared in the picture
1.0,I purchased this item to work out in. It is not flattering and extremely comfortable.
1.0,Did not fit. Top was too small & bottoms were too big
1.0,This sweater does not look anything like the picture.  The color is wonky and doesn‚Äôt lay anything like the picture.  Really disappointed.
1.0,I've only worn this hat a couple of times and it has already torn and it's too late to return it. Very disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,I bought a 3-pack. I received only one mask. Unacceptable.
1.0,The ‚Äúset‚Äù button has stopped working. Have to pay For repair
1.0,My boobs aren‚Äôt too big but The too really felt like a small. I usually do well with a size large. They really need to rethink their sizes for this one. I love the thing bottom part and hate I will have to return this item.
1.0,"Good as glove only. The touch screen doesn‚Äôt work after one day of wear. These sizes run small, if you have small hands they are ok."
1.0,I realize that its not a lot of money but 11 out of 40 do not work!  Pretty high percentage of failure!
1.0,Smell does NOT go away. I left it in the sun for quite some days now but still stinks!!!!!
1.0,"Poor quality, broken frame. Returning this item."
1.0,Received a Fitted hat? Was way to large!  Was to received a adjustable hat with snaps on back!  Which was shown in add as adjustable?
1.0,"From the moment I got the package I was disappointed. When I first examined the socks I noticed they all had somewhat of a blue tint which was not expected, I was expecting white socks.  I can feel the seams around the socks which makes them comfortable.  Most importantly the socks slip more than my regular socks, this might be due to the weird texture in the material used  to manufacture the socks."
1.0,"Doesn't fit everyone. Wish it were a little wider. There's plenty of nice fabric, but the stitching down both sides is done in a way I couldn't pull it on comfortably. Trying to do that at the beach with water and sand, not gonna happen. Colors are exactly as shown, very pretty but sad it's sewn on the sides for a slim body type."
1.0,The pants I received was not the same as the picture. There aren‚Äôt any belt loops which was a major seeking point for me and the material was closer to velvet than corduroy.
1.0,"Way, way too small for size indicated. Would not fit an adult. Maybe a small child."
1.0,It have a spot on it I don't like that at all i will not next time make sure it's clean
1.0,Junk broke the second day I want a refund
1.0,"Completely see through, nothing like the picture."
1.0,hard to wear
1.0,"The glitter strip fell out in the wash, fits way too small"
1.0,"Broke right away, but great customer service.  Got a refund right after I processed my return."
1.0,Strap broke within the first week.
1.0,"I bought before this model in a different size but this brand is not like the one I have.. low quality, the belt is not attached to the dress ... i don't like it."
1.0,The boots are way too NARROW. Medium width  foot size or wide width foot size can not even get the boot on. Buyer beware!!!
1.0,"The tote did not come with the pouch shown or the decorative metallic hardware shown in the item description and the photos. I got just the reversible tote, with a hole in the side where the tassel should be and nothing else inside. As I see no way to contact the seller, I will have to return it."
1.0,SOOOOOO itchy!  Terrible to wear for any amount of time!
1.0,The set I received was not a matched set. It had the mermaid tops and rainbow unicorn bottoms. They are sold out of that size now so I cannot even get a replacement.
1.0,My necklace came broken
1.0,"This is a fine shoe-horn, but it can with a chip in the paint and sending it back would require a special box.  Just disappointing."
1.0,Me queda corto. No es lo que esperaba.<br />Estoy insatisfecho!!
1.0,Do not buy. The clasp broke in half the day after Christmas and this was a Christmas present so my friend literally wore it for a day and a half before the clasp snapped in half.
1.0,No where near 100% cotton. That's total BS. It's some sort of poly/cotton blend. Your feet will sweat and smell - exactly as happens with polyester socks.  Super elastic; stretches like poly. Nubby bottom material is a constant irritant. For men - these look feminine; like what your wife or girlfriend might wear.
1.0,"Ordered two pairs had to return  the first due to the poor condition they arrived in.  Just got thr second pair, they are all bent up like the first pair and sit all side way in my face.  Very dissapointed. Will order some other another pair from someone else."
1.0,"Horrible quality. It was literally falling apart at the seems. Nothing like what is pictured. Come wrinkled, making it look used. Don't waste your money."
1.0,One start because it turned my finger green.
1.0,Broke before I even wore it after opening. Weak product
1.0,[[VIDEOID:cdceafc5d94edf22f582ccc9a1e482d4]] Very disappointing<br />Only wore twice
1.0,"Product arrived less than a month ago. They've been used inside for a few hours in the evenings. They're already falling apart. I'm returning it for a refund. Aside from the shoddy workmanship, the fit is okay, nothing special but not uncomfortable either."
1.0,Fit as expected however the color is not really black they are brown!  Wish I hadn't worn them I would have returned!  Disappointed with the color!
1.0,The material is extremely cheap. It broke the next day
1.0,i got the size i usually wear and i couldn‚Äôt even pull it over my head it was so small
1.0,"They ripped the first time being worn. They are water proof, but what good are they when they rip the first time using them? Not what expected for the kind of money spend!"
1.0,"It looked cool. I ordered 2 bands...1 from 2 different merchants. 1 for myself, and one for my brother. Both of our bands broke  this month. His broke in Illinois, mine broke in Washington state. You get what you pay for in this particular case"
1.0,Sooooo small wouldn‚Äôt even fit on my 7 year old daughters head.
1.0,Should know if medium is size 10-12 or what.
1.0,Seconds hand fell off after a few days.
1.0,I open the bag put the earrings on and they broke. Very poor quality
1.0,I constantly have to keep it from riding up.  My hair is very fine so there was no grip.  Tried making them work but no luck
1.0,"The item stretch and starts to look funking after wearing it twice and after 4x wearing it the stretch of the material looks even worse, especially by the cuffs. Not of good quality. If you're ok aith the cuffs being stretch then its an okay buy."
1.0,Overall they are okay however they are extremely see-through! This limits what/when I am able to wear them which is not what I wanted.
1.0,"LOOKS VERY CHEAP WHEN I RECEIVED IT,SORRY I ORDERED IT"
1.0,Two of the four ties had snags in the silk.
1.0,"Cheaply made , material is pretty but that's about it, looks like a sack, I got a return on it"
1.0,Wore once. Wrinkles easy and not great for workout
1.0,"Apesta a hierro, no se parece a las fotos, no le sirve a mi Pandora, ni siquiera se ve c√≥mo se le pudiera poner."
1.0,"Backs of earring a are cheap plastic, I can't go a whole day of wearing a pair without loosening one, or both. I only have 3 earring left from this set none of them the same pair"
1.0,Very disappointed was supposed to be white gold and jeweler says it is just Silver plus a couple of the sets fell out after only a few wears.
1.0,This is is discerned as BLACK but color is BLUE<br />FITSvery loosely and elastic breaks easily.
1.0,"Purchase for an elderly mother with disability, wanted to have something for her cell phone to have Kelly on her, having the phone in, it‚Äôs pretty heavy and bulky."
1.0,"These glasses started out fine for the price, but as others have mentioned (and shown in pictures) after a few months you'll notice that the coating on them starts oxidizing, leaving a whitish flaky residue. On mine it hasn't reached the center of the glasses, but it looks ugly enough that I don't use them anymore. Bad purchase."
1.0,"What was once great comfortable shorts are now cheap and uncomfortable. Company must have switched manufacturers. Material is light and stiff, the waist is now low rise making these uncomfortable to wear and throws the sizing off. Sadly I will no longer be a customer anymore."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:442a545b67f08816e20e178c1103c08b]] This jacket is a hot mess I put everything in the video for you to see if you were here you need a new designer this right here is not gonna work we find my money back please I would love to retire  merchandise thank you thank you
1.0,Very cheaply made. Extremely thin fabric used even for the straps.
1.0,"This is by far the worst pair of leggings I've ever purchased on Amazon. They run extremely small, are very high waisted in the front, and low in the back. If you have big glutes, forget about it. Your tush will not fit in the back and they are not squat proof at all. There is also an obnoxious white logo in the front that is not pictured in the photos. Very obnoxious and unattractive. The fabric is horrible, it is Itchy and scratchy and causes static everywhere. Oh, and your pets hair will cling like crazy. I don't understand these positive reviews, I bought three pairs since it was a good price and obviously I got what I paid for. I am returning it today."
1.0,"Nice sweater but not as pictured. In the image, this is a ribbed knit, however, I received a wool blend and an ‚Äúoversized‚Äù style. The overall fit is very large and the material is thick and heavy, not ribbed as shown."
1.0,"I wear 34&#34; Levi's and went with the size 34 and it was a perfect fit.  The leather is nice and soft.  The design/embroidery looks great.  I bought this to wear to an Oktoberfest party and to have to wear to two Oktoberfest celebrations in my state.  It looks great on me.  Tapers around my thighs with a little room to spare.  It is not baggy at all and very comfortable.  I got tons of compliments.  The issue here is quality!  There is a leather tie on the back of the waist band.  I tied it and the very thin leather cord broke in three pieces.  It came with a back up piece (apparently this must happen often) which I decided not to use and tied it with a piece of leather lace I already had.  The buckles on the suspenders look cheap (not a big deal).  The straps of the suspenders are paper thin.  they ends of the strap in the front (the part that goes through the buckle) looks silly because they keep curling up. I kept rolling them back the other way so that it would lay somewhat flat and it always returned to sticking straight out and a little up.  Then, I'm at the party for 30 minutes and someone tells me that one of the buttons holding the suspenders on the back popped off.  When I took it off a little later, I noticed that some of the stitching on the seams inside are coming apart and while this part isn't important, the &#34;lederhosen4u&#34; label inside came unsown and was hanging down.  All this and I was only at this party standing for two hours.  No dancing or anything.  If it were only $80, I'd be okay with it, but I paid $145.99.  I'll be sending this back and getting a quality pair.  (I'll try to upload pictures before I send it back)"
1.0,I am usually very pleased with products purchased through Amazon but this one is a loser and I am disappointed.<br />I wanted something that I and/or my dog could wear to increase our visibility when we walk when it is dark.  The bands are way to large to fit around my wrist.  I do loop a band around my dog's harness so that works.  The battery life is very very short!  Each band only lasts about 2 weeks before brightness of light fades.  It is not worn for hours and hours so I think battery life is extremely short.  Will not purchase again.
1.0,The lens quality is so poor that it is a constant strain to read.  I use them to read at night in bed and the fall off easily.  They are abrasive on my nose.  Would not recommend them.
1.0,The item arrived late and with a faulty zipper. I literally didn‚Äôt even try it on! Opened the package and it was already like that with threads poking out. Waste of money honestly!
1.0,"These were the weirdest shoes.  They looked great, but as soon as I put them on, they started slipping out from under my feet and to the side.  I gave them to my daughter (ordered 2 pair) and they did the same thing to her feet.  Don't waste your time, unless you need foam for another purpose.  Then they might be worth the price for cutting apart and using as foam blocks."
1.0,"The shirt itself was nice quality. However, it was packaged while the screen printing was wet. The package was vacuum packed which meant that everything was tightly compressed and the printing stuck to itself and other places where it wasn't supposed to. No way to pull the shirt apart to wear. Sending back."
1.0,"These things are extremely difficult to bend so you will end up losing these. Do not undermine when I say these are difficult to bend because they are. If you have Hulk fingers then sure you can buy these and bend them, but chances are your don‚Äôt so don‚Äôt buy these."
1.0,Split in pieces
1.0,No me gusto mucho me queda muy largo no a los tobillos como se mira en la foto encargu√© un L i soy5‚Äù4 de estatura . Muy caro para el material y estilo y me quedo apretado de los brazos :(
1.0,Inferior product!! Very unhappy since it fell apart during first use! Thought it would be a great travel bag. 1st buckle broke during 1st leg of my journey. Luckily I carry spare caribiners!! Other buckle on shoulder strap broke at next airport.... Then the interior zipper gave way. Didn't last a dozen unzips!! Not a sturdy bag to say the least!!
1.0,"Exact knock-off of the Australian brand &#34;Stock Watches&#34;.  Even though on box says &#34;strap is genuine leather that will patina overtime&#34;,  the strap is made of faux leather. Second hand does not align with minute marks, that bothered me a lot. If you don't care about these two things, it overal has a good minimal look."
1.0,Junk !! If you have a choice by something else
1.0,I was getting ready to wrap this robe as a Christmas present. Saw the hole in the sleeve fabric. The hole is not on a seam it‚Äôs flawed fabric. My grandson picked this out in April and I‚Äôve had it since then. Too late to send it back now. Will mend as best I can. Due to poor quality would certainly not recommend anyone else  purchase from this company in China.
1.0,"There is no way what I received was a XL,yet that is what it was marked."
1.0,"I ordered a black jacket and got purple. The hemline hangs unevenly, shorter on the left than the right. It‚Äôs going back when I return from my vacation. What a disappointment!"
1.0,I did not find the red on and purple on
1.0,Returned twice the order is still not correct.<br />First time missing key chain second time the mug was the only thing delivered.
1.0,Terrible product. Broke as soon as I got it out of the package.
1.0,I loved how it looked but two  of the snaps broke after trying it on him one time.
1.0,Was expecting red like picture.  These are more rust color
1.0,"I can't find a contact number or address to write to them about this or get credit.  But upon receiving this dress, I noticed what appears to be a blood stain on it.  I can not return it due to the fact that I won't go into a P.O. right now with the virus out there.  I am very disappointed."
1.0,Waste of money. Falls off easily. The wire shows with whatever you are wearing. Don‚Äôt waste your time or many
1.0,The jacket was too small. I ordered a 2XL and it seemed like it was a large or XL. The words fox racing we‚Äôre missing.
1.0,Zipper broke on the first trip.  We also bought a more expensive brand called eBags and wanted to see how they compared. Unfortunately these didn't stand a shot
1.0,One earring broke the first time my daughter wore them.  Not very happy!!
1.0,do not buy this. they look nothing like the photo and do not fit at all. if i could rate it 0 stars i would.
1.0,The sole separated from the shoe on the first wear. The VERY FIRST time ever wearing.
1.0,My son is Colorblind both ways and doesn‚Äôt see a difference at all
1.0,Save your money. Headband Snapped in half after 1 wear
1.0,I BOUGHT A SIZE 6 THEY FIT MY DAUGHTER WHO WEARS AN 8
1.0,"My husband likes 1/8 inch waxed shoe strings and they are hard to find locally. So he found some here on Amazon. We purchased these and received them only approximately 2 weeks ago. His job is manual labor in the grounds department, so dress shoes are what he wears after work hours. Not all day. In just these short couple of weeks, these shoe strings have already worn significantly as you can see in the picture. And, really, they don't feel waxy. There is a slight sheen on them, but certainly don't feel waxy. Don't buy these."
1.0,"These are advertised as cotton, but they are predomintly polyester.  They're gone into the trash."
1.0,I ordered this because I was searching for kids masks but this turned out to be for adults.
1.0,"Not sure why these are so highly rated. They are made of a very thin, bendy plastic. Lightweight is great but you have to consistently try to reshape them so they lay straight on your face. Not durable and the plastic lenses are not easy to clean, even with the provided microfiber wipe."
1.0,Hole in the back of the dress and the dress was too short. Would not buy again. Very disappointed. Getting refund.
1.0,"There are so many things wrong with this garment I don't even know where to start. It is very very thin poor quality fabric. I'm talking like the stuff they make child's Halloween costumes out of.  The measurements aren't true to size. I ordered a 3X and it would be a stretch to think that it would actually be more like a large. It is also very short, would fit more like a crop then a wide leg floor length like depicted in the picture. I ordered this thinking it would be a fun date night outfit so disappointed."
1.0,Money down the drain! The clasp on the back didn't attach well and fell off the first time I wore it.
1.0,Not a good item.  The ends constantly slip off the glasses. And the chains are way to small.  Tossed them in the trash.  Dollar store has better
1.0,"Purchased this hat for a cruise to the Bahamas!  It  actually fell apart before I even got to wear it on the cruise.  It had arrived with a small rip in the seam that grew and grew over one afternoon of wear, until the entire visor fell off.  Not cute or functional when you‚Äôre trying to shade your face and chest at the beach."
1.0,Pretty hat but much too smsll
1.0,"Item was NOT as described! I expected amber (cognac) lenses... they were Smokey grey. Also the materials were quite cheap, and the fell off my head due to it feeling WAY too big!<br />Instead of a |_| shape... the temples (the bit that goes along your face to the ears) were more open like a \_/ shape!<br />The seller did give a prompt refund including the return postage I had to pay."
1.0,"The second hat was supposed to be a red color, but instead it was a cheesy looking mauve color. And the cat head was like a sticker and not embroidered like my first hat order."
1.0,Just not flattering on me
1.0,Very disappointed in the quality of the necklace.  Locket and chain look like plastic.  Stone had fallen off in the packaging and had to be super glued back on.  Would have returned it but my granddaughter ‚Äòloved‚Äô it and she lives it inspite of its quality.
1.0,"loved how this looked and was very excited when I first tried it on.  unfortunately, after wearing just around the house for a couple of hours the elastic started to stretch around the chest band and became very loose.  Poor quality and I could tell it would only get worse."
1.0,Way too small. Ordered a large for my 8 year old. It barely fit my 4 year old who was wearing XS. It also took way too long to arrive. And after the first wash the entire image came off. Terrible product
1.0,It fits and all but the rings are HUGE. Looks nothing like picture...
1.0,"Siren song is a joke!!  The alarm would not deter anyone.  In fact , it is made so cheaply that mine would go off in my as it hung on the outside of my purse.  People ( if they noticed it) barley looked at me.<br />Also , it is made so poorly that in a few weeks after my elderly mother gave it to me as a Christmas gift the back fell off!!  I did not even notice the back was gone as well (as the battery) for a few more weeks I am sure.<br />When I contacted the company, asking they send me the part, they said they would just send me a new alarm.<br />MONTHS later and 3 long phone calls, today I was told there was nothing they could do.  And all the &#34;service representatives&#34; who said they would reship one to me....was all a lie!  I was very unhappy the last couple of phone calls to them I asked to speak to a manager.  Guess what??!!  They would not allow me to talk to one.<br />This is a scam, this product is a waste of money. What is sad is my 90 year old mother thought it was<br />believable, she spent her social security money to buy several for Christmas gifts.  To be honest, this piece of junk is not worth having , but to be sure my mother thought she had bought a great gift I wanted to be sure I had it on my purse for her.  They are a terrible company!  Thought I should let people know so they do not get<br />taken advantage of.!!"
1.0,Not flattering!
1.0,"This product is definitely not what the picture shows. I bought this as a gift for my sister and she hated it, even though she was the one who picked it out. I had to return it."
1.0,"I purchased these to get a little more wear out of my regular pants before switching to maternity pants. These work, but are extremely uncomfortable.  The small metal disc on the back digs into my stomach.  After a couple hours of wear I finally took it off.  Much happier with my pants unbuttoned!"
1.0,Tore up right away.  Bought the Calvin Klein Texting Gloves recently and they are a much better quality.  I would not recommend these gloves.
1.0,They definitely don't fit like the description. They roll down..
1.0,"My husband and I love game of thrones and I got this for us to put on our keychains as a Christmas stocking stuffer. We loved them they look just like the picture. We immediately put them on our keychains, however only after 2 days my husbands fell off. Husband said he even clamped down the chain bethel saw that they were cheap but it still didn‚Äôt help :("
1.0,"Complete waste of money. Terrible quality - the ""leather"" broke down, cracked, and began peeling off the first time I used this. Unusable after three wears."
1.0,"Easy on, easy off?  Not even close!  I'm keeping them & maybe, in time, I'll be able to get them on after a few washings."
1.0,Hated this blouse. Sent it back
1.0,I literally got a whole different dress it was so ugly compared to the picture it looks nothing like what I was ordering.
1.0,It arrived broken and beyond repair.
1.0,oof
1.0,At least two of the bras had stains. Buyer beware.
1.0,I forgot to return these . So I‚Äôm stuck with earrings I never got to wear . They are not well made at all . Very disappointed.
1.0,Did not fit at all :/
1.0,"Boot cuffs were defective.  The tags on the side of the cuff were wrong, one was on the inside and one on the outside.  Seller kept saying there was nothing wrong with shoes.  I ended up throwing the boots away, no one was going to wear a pair a boots that were obviously defective."
1.0,"Do not buy this. The pants are not high waisted at all ,and it arrives with a tiny hole on the front on the pants. I received it about 10 mins ago tried it on ,and I am taking it back.  Very misleading.  I bought pink ,and red both are going back never again."
1.0,these leggings were very disappointing the child had them on less than an hour and the fabric split and started to peel
1.0,"i had read the bad reviews and picked them up anyway. they were the exact measurements i was looking for, the lenses, frames the whole works, so i went into it with some optimism: maybe the other reviewers were just total sourpusses.<br /><br />they arrived damaged and are the most cheaply made glasses i've ever seen. they wouldnt be a bargain at $1, let alone $9."
1.0,Does not work. Waste
1.0,Returned twice. Runs small.
1.0,Very uncomfortable. Light shines in through nose piece. Spend the extra couple dollars to get a nicer one. These are terrible
1.0,These shirts are nice for what they are but in no way should they be considered compression unless you buy three sizes smaller than your actual size and for that you can just go buy any shirt.
1.0,This was too short leg length and torso length or maybe there was supposed to tons or cleavage...
1.0,It broke on my little fingers üò†
1.0,"Fit weird and it's horrible. Def not corduroy. Not even cotton of any sort. It's all man made material, so a static nightmare. The shoulders were wide on me, but the bust was small. It's shiny material. Instantly hated it and returned."
1.0,One of the two key chains arrived in 3 parts.  The pin connecting the parts was broken and cannot be fixed.
1.0,The pockets of this dress flare out and make you look wider than expected.  Not flattering at all!
1.0,Very cheap sunglasses . They broke almost immediately.
1.0,Wish I had read the reviews before buying this earring.  My ear turned green!  Looked great but at what cost?  An earring should not cause your ear to turn green and get infected!
1.0,Returned very cheap fabric
1.0,Was to receive multicolored bands...waited awhile to get them. Only I got just 1 band.
1.0,These shorts feel like they are made out of plastic zero range of movement. If there was a zero star that is what I would‚Äôve given it.
1.0,"This had a rip on each arm, and the ruffles are poorly finished."
1.0,"Got these on a Friday before I went to work, so I put them in on Saturday morning before I went grocery shopping, and three of the four balls were missing by the time I got home less than three hours later."
1.0,I needed this to wear with flats and it covers way more than the shoe so it looks terrible.
1.0,Failed after a few times wearing them out.. The plastic  loop that holds the strap closest to the toes was not even sown in.. Basically some adhesive was all that was holding this together. Very disappointed poor quality control for sandals of this price range. The cheapo ones I purchased from bobs have held up much better under much more wear and tear...
1.0,These shoes gave my son the worst case of stinky feet. I can't get the smell out and my whole house smells.  It was a waste of $20 as I had to buy him new shoes to replace these.
1.0,It came with a broken zipper and a snap missing.  I returned it.
1.0,"Too for great, bottom was weird fit. Also, swimsuit turned a different color when I went in the pool."
1.0,Very flimsy very sheer ripped as I was putting them on the very first time
1.0,"The item I received was nothing like the picture. The picture is blues & purple, with 3/4 length fitted sleeves. The one I got, was a similar pattern..........but was blue, green & orange, with short wide sleeves.<br />I am 5'4"" and weight 165, with 36DD chest.  This was HUGE on me!<br />I  returning it."
1.0,Cheap and don‚Äôt stay in place
1.0,Fog like hell
1.0,Didn't work. Plastic dissolved
1.0,You order something expecting to get what is in the picture. That is not what happened!!. The digitally printed image on the tie I received has a lot less detail than the one on the product page. I will be returning this ASAP!
1.0,I got the black leggings in the mail today and they ripped within just a couple hours wearing them. Very bad quality.
1.0,Chain tarnished after wearing it twice
1.0,One star for being cute but way too small.  I wear a US size 12 and couldn‚Äôt even zip it up.
1.0,This was the second one I bought.<br />Fell apart in less than a month<br />The first one fell apart at 3 months.<br />No good.
1.0,The cut of the snowsuit is for a very thin child. I ordered the exact size my child wears and couldn't even zip the snowsuit up all the way.<br />I planned to return the suit until I figured out I would have to pay shipping which cost almost as much as the suit itself.
1.0,"This is cute but see through. I followed the size guide,  but it‚Äôs a size too small. I got it bc it said it was 95% cotton, but it‚Äôs 95% polyester!"
1.0,Garbage..broke first time I wore it
1.0,Unfortunately one zipper broke the 2nd day of use. We continued to use it best we could. Then about a month in the other one broke off. It‚Äôs very cheap and not well made.
1.0,One use and they change color
1.0,Waste of money don't buy
1.0,Awkward fit‚Ä¶.I really wanted to love this suit but had to return.
1.0,The measurements for the size chart are not accurate at all. I couldnt get this over my chest. Not worth it at all.
1.0,Poor fit. Extremely uncomfortable and constrictive.
1.0,Cheap and not at all what the picture looks like. Not to mention the belt was seriously 5 feet long. I returned it
1.0,Garbage.. Defeated the whole purpose would not stay on the glasses kept falling off
1.0,"I  did not like this item at all.  The moment I opened the package and felt the material, I sealed it back and processed the return within 10 minutes and shipped it back the same day."
1.0,This sweater is really poor quality. The threads we're coming out when I opened it. Each of the wrist holes were different sizes -the right sleeve looked like it was made for a toddler. The whole thing was unsymmetrical. It looks really junky.
1.0,"Horrible... Does not fit... Gaps in the front, feels cheap"
1.0,"These took forever to get here, just one of the two pair ordered.  The fabric is cheap, itchy and isn‚Äôt ply able at all.  I would recommend you make your own out of tree bark to match the quality.  Don‚Äôt bother with these!"
1.0,As i write i ddont even know where these are in my jewelry box. they are that small. way smaller than the picture . I am afraid they may even pass through my ear holes when i decide to wear them. Beautiful but way too small. But if you like them that tiny... then you may buy
1.0,You can get better quality bracelets in the toy department of the dollar stores.  Very cheaply made.
1.0,Videos are to be used only in region 1 USA and my purchase was for Xmas present to be used in Mexico which is region 4
1.0,Terrible material....its made out of sweatshirt material!!!! In addition  you have to have a long torso for the curves of the dress fit on a persons body !!!
1.0,"Bought twice.  Sent both back.  First one, pin was too long to fit into watch. Second one, only one pin fit; other was too short. Would not recommend."
1.0,Runs real small. And its a mustard yellow.
1.0,"The item is metal not sterling, they turned black. Picture attached."
1.0,No me agrado se muestra fragil y el cierre no es el esperado
1.0,The tshirt looks different than what was recieved.  Shirt was dull and flat.
1.0,Made very strange. I sized up for my 7 year old because she's tall. It was extremely large on her around the waist and arms but was way to short on her torso. The fit is very odd . I don't think exchanging it would matter.
1.0,This dress does not fit like the description or the model. It was way too long and way too big.
1.0,Looks like a trash bag. I got a small and it was huge
1.0,"Nice, but the setting is a bit big for me.  I'm sure a lot of others would love the size of it though."
1.0,"Two lenses were scratched, and one set was missing a rubber grommet for the nose piece. One would think that out of 3 sets, one would come functional and unblemished.  Wrong.  The ones I ordered in single pairs didn't have this problem and work great, although the lens is a little dimmer than I would prefer."
1.0,Akward fitting arms I had to return
1.0,False size and shipping is to much to send back
1.0,"Thin scratchy fabric.  Lace more like fringe that does stand up. Brand new, never worn, yet has dark spots like it came in contact with something oily. The drape is like wearing a sack. I will only be able to wear this under a jacket or sweater."
1.0,The straps were to loose on my foot. This item was returned
1.0,Didn‚Äôt last a month and the color was gone ... this was a bad idea
1.0,"Terrible. Not sneakers, at best they are even thinner and flatter than water shoes. Only as pictured with something stuffed in the shoes. USB Connecter is exposed and very cheap wiring. Very cheap."
1.0,States oversized...definitely not.
1.0,Broke within a month of use. Same as other people have reported the buckle-arm broke off. Do not purchase!
1.0,"The coat I received looks nothing like the picture, no fur around the hood, no drawstring.  I'm sending it back for a refund."
1.0,So with everyone‚Äôs  rating this product a 5 star and saying how comfy and soft they are‚ÄîI came to a rude awakening to find that they are not soft at all. The bottom part is so hard!! I bought them for the comfort not even the look because I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre that pretty I just wanted that fluffy soft cushion feeling for the home but I‚Äôm disappointed that the reviews mislead me. Ugh! Don‚Äôt buy if you want comfort. They don‚Äôt even bend so when you walk you pull the straps on top and eventually might pop by how hard the bottom platform is. So this is a no. Good for little girls maybe.
1.0,smoke test failed worse then any other --
1.0,It had holes in it and it felt like it was made from a plastic bag.
1.0,Had to have a tailor completely remake this ill fitting dress.
1.0,"Very, very  disappointed. I was hoping too get the same color as the picture shows.  I received  Completely different,  not even similar color.  I have a outside  wedding coming up and thought these would be nice too have for our guests. Very thankful too myself for not ordering all of it. Will not order from Spring fever again"
1.0,Shirts are very small. My child can wear a 10/12 but I typically do buy a 14/16 in at shirt that I plan to dry. These 14/16 did not fit at all. Very short and small.
1.0,Quality is not good. Color was suppose to be black; it was dark khaki green in appearance...<br />not eve. A charcoal color which would have been closer in color. Big disappointment.
1.0,Cambio de color en la primera puesta.  Se puso de color gris oscuro.
1.0,Two-piece not jumpsuit
1.0,"Poor quality shirt. Tried to return, but would only issue a gift card. There is nothing appealing in the store to redeem the gift card. Useless."
1.0,Very cheap material dont waste your money
1.0,its not worth it the price and its so small and did cut very fast üòï
1.0,"I  feel absolutest  cheated, the product is of extremely poor quality and the print is even worse, cheap and smelling is quemicals ..."
1.0,El art√≠culo nunca llego
1.0,The quality is too poor. The Zipper is not easy to use. I expected something nice for the price I paid. I was totally disappointed.
1.0,Nice print and fabric however the shirt fits weird smh sp I give it away
1.0,Cheap cheap ........cheap....how could you! !
1.0,"Absolute junk and a waste of money, lenses didn‚Äôt fit, had gaps between frames and lenses. Nose pieces are crap, wouldn‚Äôt stay on. Center bridge insulators (I guess that‚Äôs what they were supposed to be) are crap."
1.0,"The loop on the end of one of the cords was broken, that is the thread that forms the loop was unraveled and disconnected, so no loop on one end to hold my glasses. The other cord was ok."
1.0,"It Smells awful, defect from mold has split seam.<br />I tired washing it but the smell just won‚Äôt go away.  Inside has a sort of oily coating not even dawn dish soap can wash off."
1.0,"Unfortunately, the only thing that was right about these no tie shoelaces was the color. They were definitely Navy. They are advertised as being for children and adults , I am an adult woman with an 8.5 wide foot. The smallest tie was way too large for my shoe. You could stick your index finger under the loop that was made when it was installed in the smallest eyelet. When I tried to remove them (so that I could return them), but unlike other silicone shoelaces I have used, they could not be pulled out without cutting them. I cut them, so I cannot return them. Please be aware and do not make my mistake."
1.0,"This does not look anything like the photograph and the fabric felt weird.  It was slinky, but scratchy."
1.0,"Horrible, color no era el que muestra y la tela demasiado mala calidad..."
1.0,"De muy ma la calidad, en menos de un mes cada art√≠culo se ha roto en el mismo lugar... ya perd√≠ mi dinero."
1.0,"Would have loved it, but it REEKS of cigarettes.  Tried washing, airing, still STINKS!!"
1.0,Broken. The posts are thin and fragile.
1.0,"These definitely run small, and I even ordered a couple sizes up hoping they wouldn‚Äôt be too small. They still were, and the lace is pretty cheap. It doesn‚Äôt hold up well to normal use‚Ä¶I got holes in the lace the first time I wore one."
1.0,Never purchase from them again dress is horrible sizes sucked
1.0,Fabric split in just 3 months of wearing
1.0,"Runs small, very thin material so it's completely see-through. Didn't expect the body-con style for a sundress either. Super disappointing"
1.0,"Way too small, meaning the sizes aren't even close to correct.  Material is not comfortable either.  Pretty to look at, but either the shirt was mis-marked on size or they are about 2 sizes off."
1.0,"False advertisement, product is printed not embroidered. Very disappointed."
1.0,Too large and felt cheap.
1.0,"The two unicorn caps are cotton and the other are made of some shiny, thin polyester material, not cotton. Disappointed they weren‚Äôt as described."
1.0,"Pictures stolen from The Velvet Acorn, where this pattern originated."
1.0,Not true to size. Might fit a kid
1.0,After a few weeks stone fell out
1.0,this top was not true to size. it fits like a 3x. very uncomfortable. will not reorder. I do not recommend this item
1.0,The shirt I got was not the shirt I ordered. It's far inferior quality.
1.0,it didn't work for the lens that said it was useful so I lost my money
1.0,"This is nothing like the picture. Wrong color, fit and the fabric even looks completely different. Not worth keeping even."
1.0,"Cute outfit but the bow came off during the first wash.  It‚Äôs unraveled so much, there‚Äôs no point trying to reattach it.  Shirt would be ok without it except there‚Äôs a very noticeable glue stain where it used to be.  Yep, glue - not sewed on.  My granddaughter hasn‚Äôt even worn this yet.  Just washed it for the first time so it would be clean for her to wear."
1.0,Very cheap and looks nothing like the photo
1.0,"This is a stretchy material, and runs extremely small.  I like oversized tees, I ordered an XL, I normally wear a medium.  This tee was too tight, like, skin tight."
1.0,Ugh...super thin sock that did not keep my feel warm at all in 40-degree weather.
1.0,"They split apart after 3rd time wearing. While. At. Work. Don‚Äôt do it... if you are unable to purchase a name brand, go to goodwill or wait for a good sale at your local department store. No good. I‚Äôd give these negative 10 stars, if I could."
1.0,"I am too lazy to return these or I would have. I am so very disappointed with these. I couldn't open a single one without the aid of pliers. Pliers!! I refuse to put one in because I can't imagine how hard it would be to take it back out. Clickers are my preferred jewelry type because they're so easy to use, and these are just terrible. The clasp is ridiculously hard to open and recluse. Don't waste your money."
1.0,The zipper broke after a few months of wearing the jacket.  No information for returns or warranty.
1.0,"While the bead work is very nice, I was only sent one earring of the set instead of two for this purchase"
1.0,The material felt so cheap the joggers looked Nothing like the picture very disappointed in these I wouldn‚Äôt purchase these. Bought a small and were very tight in the butt area.
1.0,Maybe worth the 1.00 from wish but not the 10 bux from amazon complete crap.
1.0,Doesn't work. Send me something that will take the wrinkles out.<br />JOHN
1.0,"I ordered what showed on their website, but I just received plain black Aviators! Absolutely horrible."
1.0,"I have some many bracelets by Amandastone, and was looking forward to this piece.  However, it was so small that I couldn't get it over my wrist and it had neon pink elastic threads holding the pieces together that showed through the stones.  Additionally, this piece had very little of the colored stones and was mostly a yellowish clear color.  Sadly, I had to return this."
1.0,Poor picture quality
1.0,Really cute and fit perfectly but completely tore after the first use
1.0,By far the worse boots I have owned in 35+ years of hunting....literally the 1st time I wore them...they leaked so much that they could not be worn again while on vacation....actually looked to see if the soles had holes in them....boot look good but performed horribly...spend your money on a different boots...or buy a boot dryer like I am using in the photo...
1.0,We received the same design and color in 28 inches instead of 29 inches as mentioned in the product details. We have returned it!
1.0,"The optical quality of the lenses are terrible to the point text is unreadable. The adjustment knobs are stiff, but with significant care, adjustable. I removed the protective film from the front of the lenses and spent ages trying to remove it from the rear, to cure the optical quality issue. Only to find out that there is no protective film on the rear of the lens and the optical quality can't be improved. Will return product."
1.0,Bodice too tight and see thru length 6 inches too long
1.0,"HA! The second I took this out of the package I knew it wasn't going to fit. I tried it on anyway, not a chance of getting it on. I think they made this out of scraps...I could be wrong though."
1.0,"I read the reviews and so I purchased a 3x even though I only wear an American XL, but even that no wear near fit over my boobs. The arms are cut really small at the joint even though they flare nicely at the end.  The waist is very short.  Overall sadly the dress is not sized for Americans unless you're very petite.  On the more positive side I really wish it had fit because the dress is beautifully made.  The bright white and embroidery make it the perfect summer dress.  If only....."
1.0,"Very uncomfortable, the holes for the eyes, the nose and the mouth are very small, they are not like the ones in the picture. No space for the goggles, difficult to breath through the tiny holes. This is for a 6 year old child, not for an adult."
1.0,Frames are so tight they gave me a headache.
1.0,They are no sliver at all and the finish looked horrible
1.0,Stones are falling out of ring
1.0,The band fits nice but after about a week it no longer stayed snapped into place and slides in and out of the apple watch. Mine is also slightly the wrong size so it does not sit flush inside the watch. If these weren't an issue it would be great but it makes it impossible to wear not and I have one had it on for about a week.
1.0,"do not follow the size chart, it‚Äôs so small! if you are a small or medium get a 2XLARGE. Ordered a 2x and it‚Äôs tiny!"
1.0,Bought these a couple months ago.  One of the lenses has become lose and can not be worn.
1.0,Very cheesy. Sorryüò•
1.0,So the waist is real stretchy like in the picture and would have fit... except there is not enough stretch in the legs!!!! Could barely get over my knees! Bummed üôÅ
1.0,I normally wear a medium but when it comes to dresses I do a large because my legs are 75% of my height! I decided to be extra careful with this dress and get an extra large! Well it fits like a medium I wanted this dress for a funeral this weekend so it was kind of a quick decision to buy but still not cheap for it to not even fit!! Don‚Äôt waste your money
1.0,This is the worst piece of fabric I have ever been near. It shead EVERY WHERE ON EVERY THING.
1.0,Didn't know the brand name at all... But it feels like a cheap brand with little attention to detail.
1.0,"Broke after wearing it for one day! What a piece of junk for the landfill. Very irritated because I almost lost the watch. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money, this is garbage."
1.0,"I am from Venezuela, I bought these sunglasses because the model like me, to my surprise when they arrived what they sent me does not look anything like what was advertised, the worst is that I wanted to complain and as time went on, should change photos and thus not cheat customers (soy de venezuela, compre estos lentes de sol ya que el modelo me gusto, para mi sorpresa cuando llegaron lo que me enviaron no se parecen en nada a lo que anuncian, lo peor es que quise reclamar y ya paso el tiempo, deber&iacute;an cambiar las fotos y as&iacute; no enga&ntilde;an a los clientes)"
1.0,AWFUL!...Purchased some months ago however just wearing it and the material is awful!..It rises as u walk which most sweater material  is stationary!.
1.0,Totally see through
1.0,"I can't recommend Chocker Necklace, more suitable for little girls, and for what you get, and the price is offensive, I probably won't order from this vendor again,save your money you won't like what you get Paz.<br />Cookie"
1.0,"The mask looks nothing like the mask form the show. The jumpsuit is ok, not the best either. But the mask is literally horrible. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it and now I‚Äôm very disappointed:/ it says returns allowed when you buy but they‚Äôre not letting me return. Please don‚Äôt waste your money, the mask looks nothing like how it‚Äôs supposed to and it‚Äôs very small"
1.0,Came with missing buttons looked like it was a returned item. Requested a new one. So we will see how that one is. Other than that it looks nice.
1.0,XL is NEVER too small but this one definitely is.  I was looking for loose and comfy and sadly this is neither...
1.0,Fit and cloth material
1.0,Bought for my husband who had surgery on his head and could not wear his reading glasses as temple rested on the wound. the teeth that hold the glasses bit into the bridge of your nose and hurt. We returned them
1.0,Looks very cheap and fake. I wish I never purchased it.
1.0,To small for plus size 3x.
1.0,A joke.....this is a rubber band....no leather in it.<br />Scam
1.0,The description and the product picture are not even close. The metal is silver in the picture and the description says bronze.
1.0,"This came way to small and it‚Äôs from shein, if I wanted a cheap bathing suit from shein I would of went to that website and bought it for 1/2 the price. Sizing was off because once again it‚Äôs from shein not amazon"
1.0,These are terrible.. We are on a European trip and all zippers broke right away.. We will trash these before packing for our return home.. We bought around same time from other companies .they are all good..
1.0,Wasn't the thick material I was thinking it was going to be so I immediately got rid of them. They were somewhat silk like. I just didn't like them.
1.0,Hooks come off from their base. Cheap soft metal.
1.0,Dislike feel and fogged quickly.
1.0,Worst product<br />My daughter ended up having blisters in both the feet
1.0,"I was exciting to receive sunglasses for 2 year old. What I received after a long wait is something a doll would wear. I don‚Äôt think these glasses would fit any child. Too much hassle to return, we‚Äôll keep it for a doll."
1.0,They look very cheap. I will not wear this.
1.0,Not true to size. Way small!
1.0,Easy to lose
1.0,The watch didn't come in a box. The fake gold color  looks like it will turn green while your wearing it. This was a Christmas gift. I'm too embarrassed to even give it to my husband. I The face of the watch looks as if it's plastic. I wouldn't not recommend this product for purchase.
1.0,Disappointed...the hat is very small like for a third grader.
1.0,I got a medium.. seemed to be a 2x. would def size way down
1.0,The top piece that is supposed to screw on to stay in place just pops off. It doesn't hold on to the main bar piece. I've never been able to wear it. Shouldve returned it for a refund when I had the chance but lost track of time to send it back. Waste of money. Hugely disappointed.
1.0,"very badly cut piece, the front is very short, very small on the shoulders and sleeves. Could not use it"
1.0,This dress runs small and is made of weird material. It also looks somewhat childish. Not what I expected from the photo at all.
1.0,these are not as good as in picture- they are poor quality and will not buy again
1.0,Esta bonita pero corre muy peke√±a pidan una oh dos talla mas
1.0,"Runs so extremely tiny it's not even funny.  I typically wear a women's medium, sometimes large in gloves ordered the large hoping the bigger size would be okay, it's nearly child size it's so laughably small.  There's no way it would fit on my hand, but it would cost me more to ship it back than I paid so no point in even trying to return it.  What a waste of money."
1.0,"I ordered them after seeing the reviews but I am disappointed with the product. I have flatfoot and was looking for slippers with good arch support. They are very uncomfortable, the strap loosened in a week causing pain in my feet  I must say the material used is substandard). Not recommended at all if you are looking for a comfortable product."
1.0,Don't buy !!! Had these for two days and the glass fell out. They are very light and don't fit right. Trying to return.
1.0,Yuck! The top fit horrible
1.0,Fabric was extremely rough even after two washings. Very poor quality
1.0,Make a person look like a house
1.0,The material is the cheapest quality of anything I‚Äôve ever bought from Amazon. It‚Äôs like that cheap material you see in those Halloween costume packs. Weird sew lines on the back too. Definitely sending back
1.0,Not what I expected. ..not true to photo
1.0,Cheap! Don‚Äôt waste your time and money.
1.0,"When I opened the package the tiny part of the clasp fell off in the box. AND, the back of the necklace was so rough in two places that it snagged my shirt. I would like it to be replaced or refunded please."
1.0,"The watch is very pretty.  Unfortunately, it does not work. We tested the battery and it is fine so it is the watch itself that does not work.  I am returning it for a refund."
1.0,No es bueno
1.0,The description I thought was for 2 outfits a little bro and big bro . When I received the outfits I only received the big bro and not little bro.
1.0,Suppose to be a dress but it fit like an oversized top. Poor stitching and straps were coming loose.
1.0,"In the past 4 years, I've placed 330 orders with Amazon and with the exception of very, very few, all have been for multiple items.  I've never had the cause to write a product review other than a couple of 5-star praises for items beyond the worth of the sale value.  I have a 34-inch waist.  I ordered the XL and they are smaller than medium shorts I purchased from WalMart.  They obviously run much smaller than stated, or they are boy's sizes.  Additionally, they are very cheaply made.  I ordered two packages of these and have opened only one so far.  One pair had an unstitched 4-inch hole in the side.  They all have fraying seams and the unraveling threads, especially in the waistband.  My sincere advice is don't waste your money on these shorts."
1.0,"Horrible product, so cheaply made like cardboard slippers. What a joke. Don‚Äôt waste your money!"
1.0,Mine came broken at the top and the seal for the lid is hit or miss and only if screwed on tighter than my eife can. Would have loved this mug except for that.
1.0,Run very small I brought a large and a x large and it was like a medium
1.0,This looks like a polyester nightgown üò£not what I expected at all
1.0,Didn't like the front plastic part of it.was no  was as it seen in the picture...
1.0,does not resemble photo at all. chain is poor quality. clasps aren't even closed completely. Do not waste time waiting for this product or others resembling it. Sadly disappointed.
1.0,They really look cheap and the fit just didn't work for me
1.0,Buckle broke same day
1.0,The shirt was very short. The pictures make the shirt look like a bodysuit.  Even with high waisted shorts the shirt was soo short.  It was also made with very thin material.  I do not recommend buying it.
1.0,Was very upset !! They were broken!!
1.0,"I had also bought a jacket, same issue, terrible quality, no style, not well finished. I should have know based on the price. returned it for full refund."
1.0,Fabric was extremely wrinkled and of very poor quality.
1.0,Made my ears green üòë
1.0,"horrible quality, one clip fell apart almost immediately- the metal bits appear to have been glued together with a semi-opaque, cheap glue."
1.0,Ordered a set of two. Both left tons of blue marks all over my pillows. They fit and feel nice but ruin white pillows.
1.0,"It is a cheap crinkly material. I purchased this on clearance and now I know why, it was. I thought it was a cotton fabric but is well...I am not sure. It is definitely not a breathable material which at least I could feel good in knowing that I could wear this dress as a nightgown but would rather wear a glad trash bag"
1.0,"The elastic waist band does stretch a great deal, but it still pinches your body creating a muffin top if you're over a size 2. I'm returning these. I'm an athletic size 8 and these pants create an unflattering silhouette.  They bunch at the crotch, pinch into the waist, and give me hungry bum (wedgie)."
1.0,"Was WAY too small (2-3 sizes too small). I previously ordered the exact same dress in the same size but different color, by same designer and that one was fine. Zipper was broken upon arrival. SUPER cheap material. Won't be ordering from the designer again. MAJOR disappointment!"
1.0,Unless your calves are completely noticeable different lengths do not purchase these socks. The socks I received were about 2 inches different in length. I washed them and tried them on each leg to be sure and one was drastically lower down on my leg.<br /><br />About the rest of the sock:<br /><br />These did not provide arch support like I expected and the foot part is significantly thinner material. There were spots that were almost see through once applied to legs because those areas stretched too much compared to the rest of the sock.
1.0,"These are great looking, but broke 2 days after they arrived."
1.0,It's a piece of junk!! Broke off my arm after only a month!!!! Don't waste your money!!!!
1.0,"Wanted to like the band.  It's very pretty and seems like good quality silicone, however, I had to send it back since one end of did not clasp into the GearFit2 securely enough.  It was on but it would wiggle and just fall off - which is obviously dangerous.  I may have just gotten a faulty product but it's worth writing a review to let you know that this is possible.  Thankfully with Prime there is free returns for this product."
1.0,I bought 3XL which are usually loose fitting for camping. My son where‚Äôs a Large in men‚Äôs and they fit him perfectly. That‚Äôs a big difference!!
1.0,The chain was received broken and the pearl is not pink as pictured.  Disappointed as was looking forward to getting this
1.0,"I ordered two of the same size and 1 fit way too big and the other was too tight. For some reason, I didn‚Äôt feel like they were authentic. I‚Äôd rather order them from a sorel store instead of here bc this was a 3rd party seller."
1.0,This appears hand sewn by a small child or someone with less sewing skill than a beginner. Material is super thin and horrible texture.
1.0,Color was more of a light green not olive.
1.0,This was waaaaay too small for a 5-10 woman. Not flattering at all.
1.0,So the ring is cute and comfortable but the gold plating on one of them came off completely after one week of normal wear. And the rings were both worn on the same finger. To me that is a dealbreaker quality control issue. I have included a magnified photo of the rings.
1.0,Nice belt until it fell apart at the buckle after 6 months of use.  Wouldn‚Äôt by this type of buckle assembly ever again since ther was no clear way of putting it back together again
1.0,The tank tops are not worth the money very cheap.  Can‚Äôt remove the wrinkles looks like you slept in them
1.0,Not worth the price. Poorly made . Very desapointed!!
1.0,Cheaply made.  Top does not fit properly to bottom and easily comes off even when removing the plastic lid.
1.0,"Product not as advertised. Soldering is very sloppy, silver knots are difficult to get in and out of cuff holes."
1.0,"Too small in some places, too large in others will be sending back"
1.0,This anklet broke 2 hours after I had it on. I didnt have socks on or doing anything that would have made it break. Getting into bed it broke.
1.0,Nunca me llego el producto
1.0,Screen did not stick to my 8+ at all. Was rather bummed but this same issue has happened with 3 out of the 4 screen protectors i've purchased. I believe it is due to the curved screen.
1.0,I am disappointed in these ear coverings. They don‚Äôt snap shut and won‚Äôt stay on. I wanted them for my high school and college-aged grandchildren for walking across campuses in the winter. But these won‚Äôt work because they don‚Äôt snap and stay on.
1.0,It looks worse than the picture. The clasp was rusty. Size is too big
1.0,"These are not all cotton/ flax.  Also, after a month of wear the inner sole ripped a little and is piercing my foot.  These are worth 5 dollars at most for the quality!"
1.0,"I‚Äôm very disappointed in this purchase, without redress. The watch came without a tool to adjust links. The wood has defects and seems very poor quality. Furthermore it irritated my skin."
1.0,Hoook missing no good
1.0,First trip and the adjustment buckle broke. Now is worthless
1.0,"These are constructed such that if your hands are wet (common for my wet winter outdoor activities) when you take the gloves off, the inner fingers get pulled inside out and then they are impossible to get back on with wet cold fingers.  Useless for my winter activities.  Probably fine for walking or driving but not safe for outdoor adventuring.  Many gloves suffer from this problem including these."
1.0,These are insanely hideous. Way bigger than I expected and cheaper looking than the picture. Wish it was possible to leave a review without having to give any stars.
1.0,It did not fit me at all it was extremely to small. I returned the product
1.0,Terrible quality.  Nylon.  Looks like the lining of some cheap dress.  Don‚Äôt bother- unless you‚Äôre a genie in a bottle.
1.0,This is my second time purchasing this chain. The first one I lost and would have given it a 5/5 rating. This second one has rough edges that pinch and scrape my skin. It snags on my clothing. It has ruined some items. I‚Äôm not happy at all. Not sure if I should chance buying another one.
1.0,Fell apart after only 3 hours!
1.0,"Horrible- super itchy, not long at all.. super short. Do NOT BUY"
1.0,"This is just a basic $2 dress. Runs small and I actually bought it larger. The color black was a bit washed out, faded. I kept it to sleep in, but I won't purchase another."
1.0,The cut is horrible and the color is nothing like the image. I returned right away out of displeasure. NEXT!!
1.0,These are definitely made for kids!  Did not fit at all! I‚Äôm normally a size 9 and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5
1.0,I‚Äôm done
1.0,The eye is too big where it doesn't fall in the center.. It's cute just wish it would fit better. Started rusting after a month
1.0,Not at all what I expected very poorly made.
1.0,"Poor quality, many threads were loose. Had to return. Love the style, wish it was better."
1.0,I bought the size 11/12 and I wear a size 10 but wanted to be sure they were big enough.  In what world are these sized 11/12?  They are more like an 8/9.  Wasted purchase.
1.0,Not user friendly at all! Extremely differing icult to put on!
1.0,THE QUALITY OF THESE HEADBANDS IS POOR. THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP.
1.0,"Very inaccurate sizing. I ordered 2, 34D and what I got looks more like a 32B and the cups are waaaaay too close together. Returning immediately"
1.0,Clasp is poorly designed and doesn't work. It took me 10 minutes to take Watch off last night. Returning.
1.0,"The American size equivalency are completely unrealistic.  So the dress will not fit.  On top of that, the return is not through amazon. You yourself have to pat the postage to return it to ""China"". The postage costs more than the dress. So be prepared to be stuck with a product that you will not be able to use and will probably have to give to someone else.  Very dissatisfied with this process!  It is a one-way deal."
1.0,Barely worn and are already falling apart!
1.0,"The discription is confusing. One sentence says 2 pack, and the next sentence says 3 pack"
1.0,"Even if you order two sizes up, it still won't fit."
1.0,"Looked cute, did not fit well once I tried it on. It's transparent and way too big. Wasn't worth $20."
1.0,if i could give thing ring no stars i would. it's already broken after a few weeks of wearing it.
1.0,Melts very fast while handleing and turns sticky
1.0,one of the zips is giving a lot of problems to open and close
1.0,"Don't waste your money. The product you will received will look nothing like the photo.  Also, item is coming from mainland China."
1.0,so disappointed. I had a baby 4 months ago and wanted some NON-maternity PJs and a size small fit me like a size LARGE. Im 5'2 125 lbs and these were WAY to big.
1.0,Es para una ni√±a. Demasiado peque√±a
1.0,Broke within a week. Not durable
1.0,Runs very small and it was a crop top instead of a full length top as shown in the picture.<br /><br />Would have given no stars or better yet minus stars but you have to give some type of rating.
1.0,WAY SMALLER THAN EXPECTED. CHEAP FABRIC FROM CHINA.
1.0,Color rubbed off in two days and they just looked cheap from the time i opened them
1.0,Not a good belt. Separated and broke within a few weeks.  Sent back
1.0,Purchased because I though that it was beautiful. Worst purchase ever. Turned black within 3-4 days of it being in my belly button :(.
1.0,"The print on the  shirt is completely off center. Not just a little bit, because a little bit I could live with; but this looks like I was wasted-drunk and decided to print my own t-shirts."
1.0,It wasn't even glitter all the ones that i ordered didn't come back glitter
1.0,Broke after a few uses. Nice design but not a quality product
1.0,Cheap material. Awful design. This looks nothing like the picture. The straps are cheap plastic and the paint is chipped. Do not buy this product.
1.0,Did not really fit. I gave them away. Product not what it said it was.
1.0,Nice looking hat but the clip on the back broke and if you sweat when wearing it forget about it the hat will stain. I have tried everything to get the stains out and all of my other hats shout works no problem but not with this hat. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the material or what but nothing gets it out.
1.0,"was recommended this product, because the Hanes I normally get have been out of stock for awhile, but when I received them they have no control at all, and they were actually too small (3x) and I still had no control. I would not recommend this garment if you are looking for something with good firm control."
1.0,Okay. This is not a $200 whatever dollar watch. It's listed at regular price. To imply it's a $200 watch is deceitful and makes it look like it's made out of better material than it is. Most of their other products have terrible reviews- people probably just like the color and look more than anything.<br /><br />If you still want to pay $50 for the watch you might as well go to the website where they automatically offer you a 10% discount if you give then an email address.
1.0,"beautiful, but hurts at lot and falls ll the time. impossiblento have in your ear..i do not recommend veramoraes from brazil"
1.0,Very poor product I am sure. I do not recommend this to anyone. The delivery was fantastic!  Really it was.  I received it never and wish I could get my money back.  Photo is of my empty kitchen counter. I wish I could take a nice picture of the shirt stay as it would be cool to have something like that last week when I needed it.
1.0,"Bout shirts for work, out of 4 2 of the arms were too small to wear and the other two are tight."
1.0,TRASH..TRASH...TRASH...NOT PLUS SIZE DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY AND WHO RETURNS BRAS NOONE... JUST GIVE ME MY REFUND PLEASE A 4X HAS 46 ON THE TAG BUT MY MOM IS A 34 AND ITS ALMOST TOO TIGHT ON HER....REFUND ME PLEASE
1.0,Did not fit at all!!!
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:371f161c27a5db8c50d1ad96f3def7f6]] The design that attaches these little cuties to the metal links on the key chain are so flimsy. It‚Äôs only a matter of minutes before these guys will be torn right off the links. Very disappointed, I bought these for the girls at work and there is no way I can give these away without knowing they‚Äôll be lost almost immediately. Sad sad moment‚Ä¶"
1.0,I own this bra in black and it is great. Ordered it in white and the zipper broke WHILE wearing it the first time. Will not order anything else from this company-I will pay a few dollars more and get something that doesn‚Äôt break almost immediately.
1.0,Got 2 of them one worked one was broke as soon as i got them.
1.0,I was very unhappy and dissatisfied. The product was not what I expected and had hard time getting them on my top ear cartilage.
1.0,The size was way too small. I couldn‚Äôt even get my feet in the socks. I gave them to my granddaughter who has very tiny feet.
1.0,"Did not whole anything in, Also, panties way to tight around the top of the inner thighs."
1.0,My daughter couldn‚Äôt read the message
1.0,"I purchased a large size, but this item is very small is not to fit American women."
1.0,"When this dress arrived, it was rolled in a ball and very wrinkly. The fabric looks inexpensive. I wear a small and ordered a medium. It‚Äôs still too small. I would never have purchased this dress had I known."
1.0,turned my neck green within the first three days.
1.0,"The nose plugs are made of great materials. However, it is a 90 degree angle on the L. Which, hurts like no other to get into my nose and getting out. I will be getting something else instead. Most of my L's are curved to help get the ring in; however these are a hard 90 degree turn like a legit L shape."
1.0,"I really like the design and the clasp. However, after 6 months of ownership, both of my necklaces became sticky; I tried leather cleaner on them but to no avail; they were so sticky that they became unwearable.<br />One of them had to be discarded because it was so sticky."
1.0,Cheaply made.  Very thin.
1.0,it wont stay adjusted its hard to open pockets maybe 5 bucks<br />fairl sh  ty
1.0,"Didn‚Äôt fit but if you return this, YOU PAY POSTAGE TO  C H I N A.  That is much more than the cost of this cheap looking dress.üò£"
1.0,Material is great but the size is not true. Also they are short ( just below the waist ) will use them as undershirts
1.0,"Horrible dress! It looks cheap and the material is thin. I wish I would have read the reviews first, because they were right. It also doesn't look like the picture."
1.0,"The hooks on the picture appear to be lever back, but my earring I received have fish hooks that are very uncomfortable to me. The earrings I received have a red stone in the middle, are triangular, and really don't look that ethnic."
1.0,"It was hard to adjust . The ball didn‚Äôt want to slide. The second time I tried to adjust it, it broke!  I was so disappointed !  Not a good buy for me."
1.0,"I bought it for someone as a gift. It looked beautiful but when I held it in my hand,  I was embarrassed that it was gold plated and not real gold. If you like GP stuff then buy it. If you want real gold, this is not the chain."
1.0,Wasn‚Äôt what I expected‚Ä¶.. Repurposed and used for another outfit.
1.0,This product looks nothing like what is advertised. Would give zero stars if I could!
1.0,Typical clothing from China. Cheaply made and wayyyy to small
1.0,The bracelet arrived broken
1.0,Disappointed with material and fit.
1.0,Item is a lot smaller than photo
1.0,This item is made overseas in a country where women are generally small-framed......this product should be labeled for juniors not women. I am 5'6&#34; 140 lbs....I ordered size large jackets that are short and too narrow...I bought 3 total recently dx'd with sun toxicity from medications. These jackets are flimsy and not worth the $15 each I spent. Don't waste your money........sadly I did.
1.0,"I have searching for the last few years for underwear that provides support without pinching or binding.. These are not the solution for me.  Although I ordered two sizes up these were still uncomfortably tight, did not support but rather compressed and the rise was too low to be comfortable for any male over 12 years old.  I understand theses were  made in China so I think if you have the physique of Bruce Lee they might work for you but I do not."
1.0,junk made in china
1.0,Fell right off the gem wasn't attached properly
1.0,Badly put together. Fits awkwardly. Very square not at all like the picture
1.0,The concept of reflexology in slippers is great but I'm so sorry I bought these.<br />I've had Walmart flip flops that last longer.  I don't know what these are made of but they tore apart in a short space of time.  Very disappointing.  Not worth the money.
1.0,"Super small, thin plasticity feeling fabric. The print doesn't resemble cats."
1.0,"super cheap - i expected the tassels to dangle more, but they were really stiff."
1.0,Cheap Hard Plastic..
1.0,Turns skin green don‚Äôt buy! Made the back of my ear swell abs turn green!! Cheap !
1.0,Size is way off. Too small. . Sleeves are really tight and too long. Zipper is backwards.
1.0,Lace eye hole broke before actually tying shoe. Never got to wear them.
1.0,Looks good but not confortable to wear. Borders are sharp and I got blisters after one day.
1.0,Too cumbersome to wear under clothes
1.0,This picture leaves the buyer under the impression that it is somewhat of a long shirt...like a tunic. Yet...it is VERY short...NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE DIPICTS and I am extremely unhappy with this product! I will no longer purchase tops from this site as this is not the first time the product was not properly pictured! Actually...almost every top I have purchased from this site is either way too short or looks poorly made when wearing. If they are long enough...they hang horribly. Super unhappy customer regarding your tops!
1.0,Fake reviews. What are the odds of every reviewer not being able to put a space after a period when starting a new sentence? If you're going to fake reviews at least change up the way you type. Pathetic.
1.0,The glasses seem ok but they are NOT. They look good but after 3 days one of the screws fell out and the arm came off.
1.0,"Way too small.These were supposed to be adult gloves.Thought it was one size fits all,but I guess you need to be under 2 years old for these to fit.My son actually had to cut a few stitches to even get his fingers or thumb in here.Material does not stretch or move.Don't buy these!"
1.0,"After only using these shoes 3 or 4 times, the front of both pair is worn and completely torn! Very disappointing! Hoping to hear back from the manufacturer and get a replacement pair."
1.0,Please don‚Äôt waste you‚Äôre money. Very cute but 3 of the 4 items broke within an hour of wearing.
1.0,"Purchased for my son to use with his halloween costume. This product is described as a ""sword"" when it is more like a dagger (big disappointment to my child). Additionally, it is probably more cheaply made than a toy you would find at Dollar Tree. It broke at the handle within about 30 minutes of my son playing with it. Seller apparently knows that this item is not worth what they are charging people because the item is non returnable to begin with. Spare yourself the trouble - go with another product!"
1.0,"I really don't like this. The product image for the black version is misleading. The image shows texture or a pattern of some sort. What I got is an all black version with no pattern or texture at all, made out of material that feels like what you would get buying a witch costume at party city or somewhere. For the price, I wasn't expecting something luxurious, but I was expecting it to at least look like the image displayed. I will wear it around the house or to sleep, it is too ugly and cheap looking to wear in public."
1.0,The material is cheap. The arm parts are made poorly. One side is big and one side is small. So weird. Return immediately.
1.0,All have been given to the homeless.  Not anything what I want.
1.0,Fades quickly
1.0,The glasses shown in picture are not the glasses that were shipped.sending this item back dissapointed.
1.0,So small!!!!!
1.0,Material unforgiving.  Shows all curves wanted and Unwanted
1.0,This is a terrible product - the pins fell out in multiple places almost immediately - I took it to my jeweler but was told it was too costly to fix.  I am sadly returning it :(  Amazon should not allow this seller on its site as the quality is so very unacceptable
1.0,so so so so bad
1.0,"It was a beautiful ring, however I received it dented and therefore wasn't very impressed"
1.0,Was happy with band and it is as described. But I guess you get what you pay for. The metal clasp on the watch broke after using for 5 days with normal use very disappointed.
1.0,"I love how comfortable these were but a seam seperated the first time I had them on. It didn‚Äôt rip, just literally came apart while walking. Very disappointed as I had ordered two pair and instead I‚Äôm just sending the unworn pair back and hoping I get back money on the pair that did rip. I had plans to buy a lot more too as they are one of the few pairs offered in 3XL and 4xL plus.<br /><br />The 4xL is what I had on the separated and they were loose on me so it wasn‚Äôt a fit issue. I just didn‚Äôt have time to return them and get a new pair in time for when I needed them and I had ordered both sizes to try on.<br /><br />Very disappointed."
1.0,"The extra material that you see in the photo is non-existent in the real product.  The only way I see this working is if someone is a size zero, maybe a size 2 with no boobs at all."
1.0,Broken zipper upon arrival it will not zip shut at all. Completely useless. If I want a refund I have take the time and money to send it back when its defective. Terrible customer service in that regard.
1.0,These glasses do not work.  Waste of money.  Do not buy.
1.0,"In the picture it makes it look long, but it is actually very short. I got a bigger size so it would hang down a bit, but it is pretty much a short tent."
1.0,"This is literally NOTHING like what I ordered. Bought in size large and my little sister doesn‚Äôt even fit and she‚Äôs a small! Wrong design, size, and model."
1.0,Look very cheaply made for the price
1.0,I did not like the size
1.0,Extremely rough & smelled weird. Returned.
1.0,Nice. Just not a good fit for me.
1.0,These shrunk on one wash and dry even though the garment instructions were followed ‚Äî gave them to my girl because they became yoga pants on me. Prior to the wash they were great and like this company but disappointed in this particular pair of joggers.
1.0,I was super excited to receive these and couldn't wait to wear them.  They looked awesome on but after one wear the velvet started to wear off.  For the price I paid for these leggings I expected them to be a better quality than what they are.  Very disappointed in this purchase.
1.0,This sweater is no where close to being as cute as it was in the picture.  It is definitely not worth the purchase.  The elbow patches don't line up on my elbows they are more inside and they feel like they might just end up ripping off at some point.  I would not recommend this
1.0,I didn‚Äôt like this dress. I was planning on wearing this for fall with legging and boots but the fabric was too thin and the color was also now how it was shown in the pics. I got the blue one. It somehow makes you look boxy. Does not enhance your curves. I returned it.
1.0,No where near 11.5 wide. More like 8 youth.
1.0,Very cheap looking in person. I can‚Äôt give this as a gift. I had to return it.
1.0,"The elastic band around the legs is glued, not stitched. After very light use, the band detached. The seller (The Gear Attic) refused to accept a return."
1.0,Does not lock in. Ordered a replacement...2nd one also didn't lock in. So it's absolute junk.
1.0,Single sided design. Very flat and thin. Not as good as similar priced charms.
1.0,"The finish was not good. The post was not filed down so it had a a thick, jagged edge which made it impossible to insert into my ear. Bought both gold and silver. The gold ones had no ""polished"" finish on one side.<br />I guess you get what you pay for. Disappointed."
1.0,Mi pedido no lleg√≥ quisiera me reembolsaran
1.0,"Can see right through it. Material very rough, not very comfortable. Fit a little small."
1.0,way too small and the sequins are all over my floors.
1.0,it looked pretty.  it didn‚Äôt fit very well and the color completely faded because the material and the color was not very good.  so i paid for one time wear.  not worth it and badly made
1.0,These were too heavy and one earring broke off at the post....useless..trashed.
1.0,"Plain, but fits okay - looks nice.  Material flimsey.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The first time I wore this dress the tag was soo itchy that I had to return home to change (was out that day and as time went by my skin was getting progressively itchier as time went by).  So of course I told myself to remove the tag the next time I wear it.  Lo and behold today I decided to wear it and tried to remove the tag.  The stitching is tiny so I used the point of my tweezer to get under it), but by the time I was able to remove the stitching, there was a hole.  I did not have to tug hard or anything to remove the stitching, but still there is a hole.  Now this dress is worthless.  Don't buy this dress.  Save your money.  This is just my experience - other folks might have had a better experience with this dress.  I shop a lot on Amazon and I depend heavily on reviews before I purchase anything at all, no matter the price.  So I'm just leaving thus here for anyone wishing to purchase this dress.  Like I said in my first review, the material seemed very flimsey - and indeed it is.  Besides, this dress looks a lot nicer in the picture than it really is.  The construction is very basic, there is no layering at all, and if you have a sewing machine you could purchase the cloth and make this dress yourself even with the most basic knowledge of using a sewing machine."
1.0,The chain just broke on half
1.0,"Fake!<br />Unsatisfied customer, nomore"
1.0,"Disappointed with the quality, clasp broke almost immediately"
1.0,made in China - really small
1.0,Size cart way off
1.0,They were too small. It cost too much to send back. I would not buy another.
1.0,"The watch does not keep accurate time ! Its good looking, but unreliable. What a disappointment. A $ 20 Timex is better"
1.0,Porfavor no compren este jeans . Queda espantosos y no viene como en la fot
1.0,Seller could not exchange for larger size per request.  Waste of my money.
1.0,"This product ended up looking absolutely nothing like in the photos. Apart from being purple everything else was different, and much cheaper looking. Oh, and they were not knitted. At all. They're some sort of thin polyester material, or similar. And the dragon's wings (as seen in the product photos) were non existent.<br /><br />At this price point I don't expect anything great, of course, but the product they sent us was a completely different one than the one they advertised, and very cheap looking and feeling."
1.0,This product is nothing like the picture. It is much shorter thank the picture shows.
1.0,"I purchased this item one month ago and after the first used one of the beads came off,"
1.0,This blouse was too small and the material was very thin. I was very disappointed üòî
1.0,When I recieved this product the bathing suit was stretched out and had no hygiene protective barrier on it  is located in the bottom of the bathing suit  so disappointed will not order it again. Lot my money on this product!
1.0,It looks completely different from the picture. No fake rhinestones it's just metal with a pink piece of plastic in the middle. I wasn't expecting something fancy for the price but it's nothing like the photo
1.0,Seriously scratchy at the mesh part
1.0,This was a pretty looking costume but it was delivered defective the hood was completely detached from the outfit and we purchased it one size larger to be safe and it was still too small
1.0,"Put the first one in my press to flatten before sublimation, it melted to the paper in 6 secs.  What a fraudulently title.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT."
1.0,Started unraveling in a month
1.0,Too small in the bust and too big around. The material that is supposed to keep the fat in check is too weak but the rest of the bra is made with the sturdy fabric that should have been used on the sides.
1.0,"Too tight, won‚Äôt keep hands cool while working with hot water"
1.0,This item looked like it was made by a two year old. Horrible!
1.0,The Garment fits as expected but it stinks to high heaven. I have tried everything to get the smell out of it. It is worthless.
1.0,Cute purse but didn't last. I only got 2 uses out of it before the lobster claw on the strap broke. It also took two weeks to stop smelling enough to carry it.
1.0,"This corset does not offer any compression whatsover. My extra large latex corsets were getting a but bug, so I ordered this to work myself down a size. I would say this corset is a disappointment but as the worst corset I‚Äôve ever purchased, latex, steel-boned or ‚Äúfashion‚Äù and the non-exisant compreesion - I can‚Äôt help but laugh at how horribly this thing was designed or the fact it‚Äôs even called a corset.  Ladies, if you want to wear something sexy for your partner, but can‚Äôt stand corsets, give this a go."
1.0,"The Clips don't stay clipped very long, it's a pain to have to keep reclipping them over and over all day. Usually it one of the two clips on the shirt side that let go.<br /><br />Update: after owning these awhile, I am dropping them to a one star. The Clips DO NOT hold. It's a bit embarrassing to walk into the bosses office and feel them let go, and end up walking out with them hanging out of your pant leg only connected to your sock.  Every time you move, stretch, bend, or climb into a car, you have to drop your pants and reattach these."
1.0,Button is slightly loose from manufacturing facility.
1.0,The second I opened the box I knew the dress had to go back because it smelled terrible. I don‚Äôt know what the smell was or why it smelled but it was bad. I did try it on to see if it was worth trying to reorder. The dress was very loose at the waist and the bust was extremely tight. The photos make the dress look like a fit & flare style but it was cut with no shaping.
1.0,"This sweater is absolutely awful! Do not buy! Soooo itchy! I swear it has little pieces of plastic in the yarn? Literally the worse sweater I have ever bought and now I can not get a hold of the buyer to return. Not worth the money! Again, do not buy!!!"
1.0,The women's medium fit more like it was made for a young girl. Reordered an XL.
1.0,This product is so easy to mess up. You can only ware it once before it Tears up. I was so excited for Halloween but the pants ripped before I got to put them on completely and the jacket ripped the second waring. It fit perfectly. But it is just so Delicate. Don‚Äôt buy this product if you plan to ware it more than once. The whole outfit is poor quality. The hat doesn‚Äôt look right at all. The belts don‚Äôt look right and the chain is on the wrong side.
1.0,"I‚Äôve never written a review for anything I‚Äôve bought on Amazon but was so shocked at how thin and cheap this material was and how off the sizing was I‚Äôm writing this one!  I ordered an XL and it was more like a small, maybe a medium if I was being kind."
1.0,I bought these for the first week of school so students could see my expression. The clear mouth piece fogs up. I tried putting hand sanitizer on it because reviews for similar products suggested that helps but it didn‚Äôt help.
1.0,To snug!!
1.0,Had to send back due to length. I am 5'3 and these were about 5 inches past the bottom of my feet.
1.0,The clasp on one of the earrings was broken you couldn't  even close it. Total waste of money
1.0,When I got my earrings the beads were broke in areas and strings hanging out everywhere
1.0,It runs small and much shorter than I expected for a 'tunic'!
1.0,"Hoops were not very durable, broke before I could get them to close"
1.0,These run very small. I got a 2xl and I usually wear an xl. They are too tight and not very long.
1.0,"This dress was very baggy and unflattering. The cut (high in front and back) gives it a very awkward look (it reminded me of a kilt). The material is thin, is quite sheer, and feels cheap. It also arrived very, very wrinkled, so I imagine that this would wrinkle very easily during day to day wear."
1.0,Waiting for three weeks and finally get those marks for children go back to school. But I feel so disappointed. They said pack individual. Want to know u guys understand what is the individual pack meaning? They pack one style in one bag. Not one pack by one. This mask is so thin .thinner than 3 layer mask. How can you said it 4 layers filtration. Come on seller stop make lie to person. Those masks are for kids . For our safety.please Don‚Äôt Buy from this seller. You are not even qualified for one start
1.0,The stitching isn't even secure. I am afraid to put this in the washer!
1.0,"I Usually take a medium, but I ordered a large size and it was still too small."
1.0,"Much much smaller than sized.  Couldn‚Äôt wear, ended up throwing away."
1.0,These are definitely too small if you usually wear Large/Extra Large
1.0,"Clearly these cheap masks were causing me to inhale whatever they're made of, as both times I wore them I got a sore throat after about 30 min.  I thought after the first time it was a coincidence, but the exact same thing happened the 2nd time. I don't know what type of particles or fibers these masks may be shedding while worn, but I definitely don't want to be inhaling them for extended periods of time. Seems dangerous and I would highly recommend staying away."
1.0,"I love the style and how light weight they are, but my FOURTH pair just came apart. All four pair, the bolt holding the screw has come off. The screws and bolts are so small I have been unable to find them. They only last a short time. Very disappointing. I will not purchase again. Fooled me once, twice, trice, quince‚Ä¶.shame on me. Not getting me a fifth time though."
1.0,"Really disappointed! I wanted to replace my moms favorite earrings for Christmas, decided on these which are a little different but close enough. I was willing to pay a little more expecting them to be nice....<br />100$ For a pair of earrings and they come in a small baggie no hinged ring box or even a cardboard box.... just a dime bag ...<br />and they are damaged.<br />Most likely I will be returning them but I‚Äôm going to let my mom decide."
1.0,"Beads have been falling out for months,  very disappointed"
1.0,Not as sturdy as the other ones I bought from a different seller.
1.0,"I wore these yesterday. Yes, they were smaller than I expected but still pretty. I had a hard time getting the plastic/metal nuts on them. When I removed them at bedtime, one of the backs was missing. This morning I went thru the many nuts that I have as backups and NONE of them would go on the post. However, the posts bent badly. Then the stones started falling out.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I am glad that they only cost as much as they did.<br /><br />So I probably won't wear them much. Wish that these description pages gave the size or showed the earring on an ear."
1.0,I didn't like anything about this product didn't come how it was described and in the wrong finish on the rings and buckle. It just looks cheap and arrived a day late I won't be purchasing this again
1.0,This hat is big enough for an adult.
1.0,"Way to long and baggy, material stiff"
1.0,I sent them back.
1.0,Super thin and flimsy. Weak chain and tiny pendants
1.0,"I specifically was looking for a 100 % cotton shirt.  Fabrics that are not breathable cause me to experience a skin reaction.  The product did not contain any cotton.  I believe it was spandex, rayon, polyester blend.  Product details were misleading.  Luckily, I noticed the issue within the return window and was able to go to a return site to ship it back.  It was a bit inconvenient since I did not receive the 100% cotton shirt that I ordered."
1.0,piece of junk.  turned in like a week after wearing.
1.0,Size not true to destription.
1.0,"Band was oddly loose in comparison to the actual cup sizing. Tight fit up top, too loose of a band... made for an odd fit overall. Not sure if it'd be considered too small or large??"
1.0,Way too small. I wore instead as a shirt with leggings. Order 1-3 sizes larger if anything.
1.0,Not impressed. Poor quality.  Very thin material. May be returning it.
1.0,This broke the second time I wore it!
1.0,Bought this and loved it but that was short lived. The first thing was the color chipping off the band. Then to add insult to injury the hold band just broken on me I could have lost my Apple Watch. I will never buy this cheap stuff again.Wondering if it not to late to return I purchased on 3/2/2018 today is 4/15/2018
1.0,Bifocal area is too small - these do not work for me.
1.0,These jeans have a lot of elastic material in the denim. The material bunches between each rip. This makes the rips gap open.
1.0,"Nice Length, well made, heavy fabric-polyester."
1.0,"The boots looked nice when I opened the box, but when I went to tie them one of the eyelets ripped right out. The eyelets seem to be held in only by a small rivet and can be pulled out with very little effort. For the price they are a good deal, but the quality control needs to improve."
1.0,"I didn't  like that the opal is like a piece of PAPER covered by a clear resin, the which doesn't  look aesthtic.<br />Also, once you open the package you will see  some GOLD sparkles or PARTICLES in color gold  that came apart from the chain.<br />So, it means that it will have a bad color after wear it and it is not made with  a good metal / material.<br /><br />I gave to this product one star because  of the materials and the misleading  information about the product description.<br />Also the price is expensive for a necklace that could not last a couple of weeks, specially because the color of the chain will come out after you wear it.<br /><br />By the way, it looks cute in the pics but how many times you can wear it in good conditions ... I will let you know after a month."
1.0,Esta demasiado peque√±a parece talla de ni√±os
1.0,"Bar too small in width and too long, looks dumb on me. I'm very disappointed. :("
1.0,"Fraying ends of material at every corner and pocket.  I'm not sure what the material is, but I wouldn't get it next to an open flame."
1.0,"Every single one of these lanyards frayed and lost the snaps within 5 days of the students using them! The fabric frays with pressure, so when the kids tried to pull the apart the ends would just fray until the snap completely came off. Very disappointing because the lanyard length was perfect for primary age kids."
1.0,I didn't want to give it tone starFlimsy material didn't like it at all . I returned this item
1.0,I forget the average adult Asian is the size if a small child. I ordered a 3XL and it wouldn't fit a 5 yr old. Sending it back.
1.0,When I opened the package I was so disappointed! It looks terrible and NOTHING like the picture! I will be returning this asap!!!
1.0,The eyeball fell off in four hours of wearing it.
1.0,"This dress seemed like it had already been washed, and the blue was faded and almost pilly. Other than that, very comfy and I've gotten lots of compliments on it!"
1.0,"The lenses appear to be of decent quality, however, they do not fit into the frame of Bolle Vigilante sunglasses.  They are a slightly different shape, but the real problem is that the retaining slot on the lenses are in a slightly different position than the OEM lenses and do not engage on the retaining bump in the frames. Because of this, the lenses will pop out with the slightest movement."
1.0,Returning. The black between the pieces is horribly visible and there is debris metal in one of the openings. Highly disappointed. On sale or not these belong at a dime store
1.0,Orderd a medium still way too big normally wear a large. Very thin material as well. Disappointing.
1.0,Item not as pictured. The color and material are different from the picture. I just wear it as a house dress.
1.0,The shorts are an odd material and indicate dry clean only. Unrealistic for pajama shorts which I had intended to wear more frequently. The top is great fabric and fits nicely.
1.0,If I can find it I like to send it back
1.0,dislike the size
1.0,"What a disappointment these earrings were! The ""blue"" part at the top was all broken and uneven - not wearable and not worth the trouble of sending them back for a refund. Waste of money!!!"
1.0,"This is a fragile piece. It looks nice, but it is so fragile, it arrived with damage to the purse's cloth exterior."
1.0,"Original review : I love this ring! Got it yesterday along with the London blue quartz one for stacking. They are lovely, sparkly and comfortable. I feel like I'm channeling my inner Lisa Eldridge! I'll be reporting back on durability as time goes by. I'm a size 8' Got an 8 and the fit is a tad roomy. The London blue I mistakenly got in a size 9 and it needs to be kept in place by the amazonite one.<br /><br />Update: The metal went absolutely coppery, almost rusty looking and it leaves a green tinge on my fingers if I use the rings. I know they are inexpensive but still, disappointed. I threw them out üòî"
1.0,I ordered a 00g and received maybe a 2g. Would not stay in my ears..
1.0,Very disappointed with my watch it has barely been a month and the buckle for the it came out already. Not a good long term investment at all.
1.0,"Falls off , magnets are not strong enough"
1.0,"You get what you pay for, wore the watch for about 2 hours and it broke, band fell apart. Don't waste your money"
1.0,It might fit a small child but it certainly isn't an adult large
1.0,"I have several Natori bras.  Natori is one of my two go-to brands.  The quality of this bra is typical Natori, which is very good.  I know my size of bra in this brand, obviously.  This bra is huge!  Not even close.  I can only surmise that this particular  bra‚Äôs size has been mismarked due to a quality control issue.  Too bad.  The style is great, especially the J-hook to convert to a racerback.  But I will be returning this and don‚Äôt intend on reordering."
1.0,"This tank top runs ridiculously small. I usually wear XL when I workout because I prefer looser more flow-y tops. I saw the reviews that said it runs small, so I bought the 2X, and couldn't believe the fit. It's practically skin tight. I would return it, but the price makes it not worth it."
1.0,This dress feels like it‚Äôs plastic it is so weird. I don‚Äôt mind the fit of the dress it‚Äôs a little big but that‚Äôs fine but I just can‚Äôt get by how the material feels and looks. Very cheaply made imo.
1.0,Bought this a couple of months back for my granddaughter. First one came with a broken handle. they replaced it no problem. It has been sitting in our attic for a couple of months waiting for our Disney trip. My son was carrying it in from the car and the handle broke on this one too. I get much better use from the ones at Bed Bath and Beyond and they only cost me around $70.00.
1.0,"You'll have to go up two-three sizes if you want it to fit like the model (ex: if you wear a medium top, order XL). My wife ordered this and the sleeves weren't as long as she wanted, and the back of the high-low hem curled up under her butt. The neckline was also a scoop, not a wide V like the picture shows. Do not recommend if you are busty! It will hang in an unflattering way."
1.0,"The shoe while nice and light is constructed of very poor quality rubber which deteriorates at a rapid rate. I received the shoes 2 days ago on monday and the heel has almost gone bald in one spot. When i walk, i do not drag my heels nor feet but do roll my heel as i step. I will attach images for all to see but understand that while they are nice and light, they are not worth the price. I wish i could return then but i doubt amazon would accept the return. I will contact then and see if i can return then because these shoes are aweful."
1.0,Cheaply made. Doesn't hang correctly.  But you get what you pay for. Just don't expect quality and you'll be fine.
1.0,This is the worst fitting bra I've ever bought and it's not comfortable or sexy.
1.0,It was not like the picture
1.0,"Braceless are not sturdy, the band's bent all different ways."
1.0,Pilling is terrible after one wearing.
1.0,"It was already broken when I recieved it.Looks like its made of cheap material, and is larger than expected. Not worth it."
1.0,"Everything about it SCREAMs CHEAP. The feel, the look even how it lattles like tin. Dont buy"
1.0,This bracelet has turned every color of the rainbow. Poor Quality and a waste of my money. I‚Äôm so glad I tried it out before giving them to my Pharmacy Tech students as a graduation gift!
1.0,"Another clothing item from a questionable country that is known for poor quality. These blew holes in them within 5 times of wearing them. Save your money and spend it on a better quality water shoe, these do not hold up, and the waste created by having to constantly replace these types of clothing items is terrible."
1.0,"I loved these glasses, I bought them to wear where I work, in a very busy operating room. I‚Äôve worn them for one week and have gotten many compliments, and they fit nicely. However I went to clean them with rubbing alcohol and it completely ruined them. I can no longer see through the lenses clearly. I‚Äôm so upset. Very cute I just wish they were more durable.<br /><br />Edit ok, I bought a second pair only to have the same thing happen weeks later. The lenses are just cheaply made. If you need goggles and are in the healthcare field invest in something more durable and scratch resistant."
1.0,"The bra material itself is very soft and the band is very comfortable.  I love those parts of this bra.  However, the way the cup makes it completely unusable.  The top of the cups stick out and gap.  Does not at all fit close to my skin.  Very disappointed in myself for waiting too late to return this bra.  I wouldn't ever buy it again."
1.0,Very lightweight. I love with the material however it was very disproportionate. I ordered a small it was very wide and very short. Too bad.
1.0,Way smaller than it appears. Very disappointing
1.0,"Print was super cute. Ordered a small... couldn't get the bottoms past my thighs and the top was WAY too large. Tied it up as tight as it could go and the cups hung off my chest, made for someone with a much larger chest and smaller waist than I have. (5'4, weigh 110 lbs)"
1.0,Very cheaply made. Will not buy again. The only nice part is the crystals. The rest looks like cheap fake jewelry. It was so thin and fragile and ugly. I don‚Äôt suggest you buy these.
1.0,"Bra piece broke the second I put it on for the first time. Mind you, I put it on right after getting home from pulling it straight out of the mailbox.. super disappointed.. I was supposed to use it for a shoot and won‚Äôt be able to now"
1.0,"Cheap material, pants extremely long, smell funny out of the package."
1.0,"The order took along time about two months,then when I received it it was too small"
1.0,I ordered according to the measurements and it was entirely too big!!!!
1.0,The necklace is one week old and the coating is falling off.  It's adorable....but perhaps it should be made without the polish
1.0,The top comes off completely
1.0,"I had high expectations for this jacket, but it ended up looking like a sack of potatoes. The material feels and looks cheap. The jacket is lightweight and does not look warm.<br /><br />I would suggest getting a size down, considering if you zip up the jacket.<br /><br />For the price, it ain't worth it. I would go with a better-known brand for $100.<br /><br />I gave up these jackets to my dogs as padding.<br /><br />‚úÖI hope you‚Äôve found the information and my review helpful.‚úÖ"
1.0,Tarnished quickly.
1.0,"Watch arrived perfect. However , the moment you want to put it on your wrist , you realised you cannot open the clasp. It needs a small object to lift the clasp. Have to return , totally disappointing. I actually contemplated for a month before pulling the trigger."
1.0,"I purchased a set of these over a year ago and fell in love with them. So much so, that I wore them all the time. With that in mind, I decided to order more, because I wanted a variety of colors. When they arrived, they looked exactly the same as the ones I previously ordered. The problem is, the new set does not tighten enough to be secure. Within a few weeks of having these, of the original set of 6, I‚Äôve already lost 4 screw-on backings because they are always loose. Now, I have to be hyper-conscious of them and check to make sure that they‚Äôre screwed all the way down every 15-20 minutes.<br /><br />As I said, I purchased these because the first set was awesome, but I‚Äôm guessing that this new set was made by a new manufacturer or has some sort of manufacturing defect that won‚Äôt allow them to firmly tighten.<br /><br />Will not be purchasing these again."
1.0,Its cosmetic simply reveals its cheap
1.0,Not waterproof! Shape change very quickly
1.0,"I definitely DO NOT recommend this product. This is definitely not intended for right handed wear. I wear a watch on my left wrist and my fit bit on my right. I have a job where I sit at my desk all day either on computer or phone taking notes.  With the way the clasp opens/closes, it would come open constantly.  Now, my bangle AND  fit bit look scuffed up due to it falling off. DO NOT BUY IF YOU WEAR ON RIGHT WRIST. I wish I could return this."
1.0,WAY WAY WAY TO small ordered my size compared to the US size chart and still 10 times to small!! it was unreal! Unimpressed and I knew to order up and I did and like i said still WAY to small
1.0,If possible order about 6 sizes larger than your actual measurements. Couldn't be more disappointed.
1.0,Assuming that I could put a credit card IN the space---I would require a TWEEZERS IN ORDER TO REMOVE IT !
1.0,The material looked very cheap it felt itchy and was poorly made
1.0,This broke very easily. It‚Äôs a beautiful piece but not worth it.
1.0,Returned the dress because it didn‚Äôt fit and was refunded a penny! After I spent an additional $30 to ship it back to the seller! Be careful where you buy from.
1.0,junk dont waste your $3
1.0,Rolls down doesnt stay
1.0,This fit so awkward. If I sized down it‚Äôd be too small. If I sizes up it would be too big. This wasn‚Äôt flattering at all. I looked like a busted can of biscuits
1.0,way too small and I did not like the material I returned it
1.0,It stretches to much for wrist size5‚Äù or below
1.0,Ordered twice and receive the wrong color both times.  Returned item and had to request refund multiple times.
1.0,Does not fit right. I am a medium but very curvy and this is not for curvy girls. Don‚Äôt buy it if you‚Äôre thick like me
1.0,The sleeves were super short.. will be returning..
1.0,"The scarves are ok. I have no problem with the scarf. However, I would absolutely not buy from this seller again. Just days after receiving my scarf, my credit card was mysteriously charged $2200+. I cannot prove that it had anything to do with this seller or customer, but considering this was the only slightly &#34;unusual&#34; purchase I had made in months (......this seller is in China), my bank and I have come to the conclusion that is is probably connected to this purchase. So do yourself a favor and spend you $3 elsewhere. It's not worth it to have to deal with fraudlent charges/cancelling cards, etc."
1.0,I would give it zero stars if it were possible. My wife purchased this to replace one that was broken in shipment. No matter what she tried it would not work so on my day off I had look at it for her. I'm am industrial mechanic so trouble shooting a problem is what I do. This was simple it is total junk. I opened the dial that controls dimming and the potentiometer (dial) looked like it was made 40 years ago. The solder joints were very badly done and the board looked like it came from a 40 year old warehouse. I tested each component and none of the resistors worked at all... see pictures and decide for yourself.  This would not have passed American safety standards 40 years ago. Amazon should have inspected this much more cloesly.<br />If I owned Amazon I would puill this from my warehouse and never allow it to be sold on the site at all. And ypu should at the very least refund my wife's money. Really you should compensate her handsomely for asking me to check. Pull this before it starts a fire or various other problems that will happen. Just a matter of time. Show the pictures to an electrician or some with the skills to verify what I am saying.
1.0,"This was my first time ordering clothing from Amazon, and I was very excited about this dress. It was so pretty on line.  But I was let down.  The first thing I noticed was that I ordered a Mismay dress, but I received a Miusol dress. I don't know their affiliation but that was the first thing I noticed.  I ordered the Royal blue dress, but the lace was lighter in color than the dress. According to the measurements this dress should have fit. The dress felt very awkward.  Just as others said in the reviews, the waist was very high, right under my breast.  My breast size is 40D I am only 5'1'' tall.  The seams in the arms felt like they were cutting into the back of my arm.  It will have to go back!"
1.0,Super ugly and short. Awkward fit.
1.0,"The suit is very cute but made for petite women.  I ordered a large in the top and it seems like it would not fit above a B cup.  Returning is a pain, I tried to initiate the process but the seller wants photos.  I would not recommend buying this unless you are a very petite, small breasted woman, then it would be very cute."
1.0,"These are 100% not real Sperry‚Äôs. Really poor quality shoe, made from China. If you‚Äôre fine with a knockoff, spend your money. If not, head to to Sperry website and purchase instead."
1.0,Does not fit as shown very cheap ships from the slow china boat. Save your money
1.0,The bat that connects the band to the watch is to long it does not work. Am super upset as this was to be part of a Christmas present. Now it‚Äôs to late to fix.
1.0,"I was so excited about it, but it came totally different necklace like a shell!!!I hate it, i will return it for sure!"
1.0,This looked like a clothing factory slapped it together.<br />No size tag on it. Almost like its home made but sloppy.
1.0,But turned color and started turning my fingers green definitely not pure sterling 925
1.0,This bra was nothing that expected.  I will be returning it.
1.0,Cheaply made and backs don‚Äôt fit
1.0,"Ordered white shirt, it showed up pink color as if white shirt washed with red shirts. Otherwise I like the material."
1.0,"This was a terrible purchase. I should've returned it.  Poor stitching, very thin and ridiculous fit. Going to goodwill."
1.0,Put it in then I had taken a nap when I woke up it was no where in sight.... it had broken off of the post
1.0,I ordered an xxl just to be safe because if the shirt shrinks it would work perfect but this damn shirt is like a women's medium! I'm so irritated!
1.0,Cheap quality fabric. Top wasn't even doubled. Can see everything. Ribbon print in front only.<br />This is going in the trash!! Poor construction
1.0,"These glasses are a waste of money, All they are are cheap dollar store readers. Can‚Äôt believe I ordered these and waited over 4 months for delivery."
1.0,The material and cut were weird and i went by the size chart and it was 2 times to big.
1.0,I loved it but it didn‚Äôt last very long. It broke.
1.0,"These are all studs that you put in through the back, which is good. However, the ends of them are so tiny as to be hardly useful at all. They dont cost much, but they surely cost patience."
1.0,Ordered double d<br />DD .. fits a B
1.0,Had to mark one star because it makes me pick one in order to post the review. They  are poorly constructed and I have been unable to wear. They do not hang correctly! So disappointed!
1.0,This blouse had cheap material didn't drape well at all. Color was pretty but that's it. And it was very boxy.
1.0,It fits really weird. the sash is really weird. I have no idea what to do with it.
1.0,Super cute shoe but didnt light up
1.0,"These dresses are poorly constructed, seams coming loose, pockets flare out at hips, and pieces are sewn together so the prints look very bad.  Terrible quality."
1.0,"it's not worth the money at all.<br />it's cute, but it's so awkwardly placed on the wrist.<br />shouldn't have ever got it."
1.0,The fabric is terrible and flimsy. I bought them based on size charts and they were huge.
1.0,"Bs product, do not order"
1.0,"Fabric is really soft and chiffon-y and the pants are ok but the top is a disaster. It fits on top, but balloons out on the sides, and won‚Äôt even tie at the bottom because the lower hem is way too tight. (I have a fairly slim figure. 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 125lbs, 32C) Pants are a bit tight too even though I sized up (M). I‚Äôve attached a photo.<br />Also, the button holes were too small! I had to wrestle the buttons into them. I will be returning. It‚Äôs a bummer because it would have been super cute if it was designed correctly :("
1.0,"Looks great, but needs an allergy warning. It must have a large percentage of nickel. I had a dramatic reaction after prolong use."
1.0,"The shoulders were really tight, so when I tried to take it off I ended up tearing the seam and the collar. The quality is not great if it tears that easily."
1.0,"I ordered this band for my Charge 5 and had to return it, as it was not compatible. I receive the correct item, as the packaging even says Charge 5 on it, but it does not attach to the Charge 5."
1.0,The zipper was so bad. It caught as I was putting on the costume and then as soon as I sat down it unzipped and was super embarrassing!! It would not stay zipped!  Order up so that this doesn't happen to you
1.0,Silver is too bright and looks cheap.<br />Do bot recommend.
1.0,left in bag because it was smaller than what I order just a waste of money
1.0,"This product does not match the description. Instead of wool it is more like a cheap craft store felt, including childlike buttons. I don't think this is even worth $5. It is a complete waste of money"
1.0,Not as pictured. Super duper small. Doesn‚Äôt have long sleeves. The sleeves are short. Would be good for a child as a cover up.
1.0,It was not the color I wanted ..
1.0,Terrible quality. Had to return.
1.0,I ordered the USA Flame and was sent Los Angeles Rams Football. The box was printed correctly but had wrong bracelet in it. Amazon was awesome and even credited my account as soon as I took it to UPS. Thanks!!
1.0,Cuff links are nice especially the pearl but I received 2 different sized letters!
1.0,This came completely crooked and if I try to bend them to fit they will break
1.0,This broke after 1 week of use
1.0,Complete trash broke second day
1.0,Will probably return
1.0,Way too small and too short.  Go a size or tow up from what you actually are.
1.0,Made out of cheap horrible itching material
1.0,Not like the pic poor material i sent it back
1.0,Cheap and 3 sizes too small.
1.0,Worst most tacky plastic ring I've ever seen. Worse than A bubble gum machine ring! It's not silver and the 'opal' is plastic and looks ridiculous. It's also crooked and the prongs are either missing or bent the wrong way. Zero quality in this product. I purchased 3 of them for myself daughter & grand daughter but unfortunately they're too embarrassing to even show them. Granted they were under $1 a piece however the product description is false & the shipping cost was almost $11.00. Never again!
1.0,Nice shirt. Just faded fast in the wash.
1.0,"Clasps wobbly, appears dirty old and used- returned!"
1.0,Fabric quality is awful!
1.0,The design wears off after a couple weeks of use. Also the prints are crooked
1.0,Lost a stone the first. Amazon sending another
1.0,"I was really excited about the style of this dress.  I ordered according to my measurements and when it arrived I was really disappointed.  The fabric is a cheap, thin, tent-like polyester material that just doesn't feel right against the skin.  Besides that, it was too small and had zero stretch."
1.0,Doesn‚Äôt slim anything out
1.0,Came in unacceptable condition
1.0,"This is grey, pretty sure the one i got is stainless steel not sterling silver....bought from Amazon Were house most likely mine was labled wrong...."
1.0,"too flimsy, not much compression happening with this."
1.0,"The ad for this shirt said it was made of linen.. its not, it is made of 85% cotton. This is false advertisement and if I had known it was not linen I would not have bought it."
1.0,Too small and ripped almost immediately and I'm not that big. I don't even have a butt and these didn't last. Not the typical leggings material
1.0,"While the quality and gauge of the item were correct, the two pieces did not fit. When I leaned forward the front piece fell out because it was too small."
1.0,did not fit at all.
1.0,"It looks ok I guess, but it loses time.  Maybe I got a dud?"
1.0,Muy grande. Es medium pero parece un L
1.0,"Came on time BUT had a rancid/spoiled shrimp smell that filled up the room in a matter of minutes of opening the bag. Not same color as advertised. Poor stitching, very ill fitting material. Waist band on pants cheap and unflattering, made like sweatpants. Looks nothing like what the model is wearing, I included a recent pic of how nice my curves are so if the item was made correctly it would fit me same as the model pic on product page."
1.0,Cheap. Hinge didn't hold up very long.
1.0,XL was childlike size. Very cheap material and the image was small/crooked.  Nothing like the image shown.
1.0,It was obvious that the band had previously been worn. Band was faded and dirty.
1.0,Ordered this toddler hat for my grandson and received a spiked dog collar on instead. Sucks because I am making him a fishing gift ‚Äúbasket‚Äù from his grandpa for his birthday and now I don‚Äôt have the hat. Thumbs down.
1.0,Returned. Looked too cheapy. Its looks better in the pictures.
1.0,cheap-didm;t hold up
1.0,The stones fell out and the beautiful tugs on anything! That‚Äôs how I noticed the stones were missing!
1.0,It was really small compared to the picture. The item barely covers my chest!
1.0,Size was way to small.  If your ordering make sure you size up it. I order a 22 and when I received it was about a 16.
1.0,Looks cheap and broke right away.
1.0,"It was the ugliest thing! The holes in the dress looked like someone just cut them in random, weird circles. It looked really cute online and when it got here I was just embarrassed to show anyone and I definitely never wore it. Way to small for a dress too."
1.0,They were broken when I got them
1.0,"The skirt is much smaller in the waist than listed.  I ordered a similar one from a different seller and it had larger measurements.  When it arrived, it is the same exact skirt as the 1st with the same small measurements, they each put their own tag on."
1.0,"Too small, even ordered 2 sizes bigger than I normally wear and SO long. Not above the knee like in the photo. Really ugly material. Just overall a terrible dress. Don‚Äôt waste your money"
1.0,"They do not look like they are advertised, they do not arrive on time, the are cheap and would not buy again"
1.0,It doesn‚Äôt look nothing like it in the photo. The shirt kind of looks like a men‚Äôs shirt the bottoms are nothing like leggings. It was too big. Trust me don‚Äôt buy this you will be disappointed.
1.0,They do NOT stay in place.  Not a good product - would not recommend them .
1.0,Too small and didn‚Äôt expect the writing to be the way it was
1.0,It's a beautiful necklace diminished by a plastic bag. I've purchased Bryan Anthony jewelry before. It should include a gift box. This is a tacky presentation.
1.0,It looked nothing like the photo. The material is rough and none of the continents are defined. I should have returned this
1.0,"Cheaply made, uncomfortable."
1.0,THIS WAS LISTED AS A BRACELET SET. IT IS NOT A SET. IT IS ONE CONTINUOUS WIRE. I EXPECTED THREE OR FOUR SEPARATE BRACELETS. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. WILL NOT BE ORDERING AGAIN
1.0,more trash
1.0,Too big of my daughter
1.0,"It‚Äôs very cute busy oh so short,,, I tried getting a size bigger too but it didn‚Äôt fit good on me... I am 5‚Äô8 and 160lbs ... made me very self conscious on how short it was"
1.0,Necklace broke after 1 hour of wearing
1.0,jagged edges. Scratches nose
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap! Material is super thin
1.0,"top too small, skirt too small"
1.0,"'Way too small - their XL is a S. Pads NOT removable, so fits only a B cup at best, maybe an A. Not stretchy enough to stay in place. Most of the cost is in the shipping, so not worth returning.<br /><br />Update: I did finally get the pads removed. But it still doesn't fit more than an A+ or MAYBE a B cup."
1.0,As I open the package I tried to turn them on.  Half of the lights don't work. They are very poorly made.  I would never by these again.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:499b75446abb3ce4fa7d8012b41ab64f]] Bought this for my daughter but when i open the package looks like they return it and i got it..
1.0,Did not get the dresses as shown.

1.0,Massively uncomfortable when worn.
1.0,Came in no box just in a open amazon plastic bag soles were out of shoes when I opened my packageüòî discription says runs small but it runs extra big
1.0,"No idea how it fits, the dress arrived with some kind of moisture in the bag- when I opened it the garment was damp and reeked of mold. Took a few washes to get the smell off my hands. It was returned, without ever leaving the bag."
1.0,The dress was tore on the right side imagine having to sew a new dress
1.0,The bracelet is very nice but I have being using it for only 3 days and the knots  already came out  I don't have the energy<br />To go through the exchanging process
1.0,"Fiat of all this order took three weeks to arrive. I unwrapped it and threw it in the washing machine so I could wear it the next day, and after remember f‚Äôing it from the dryer noticed a very distinct onion like BO smell all over the neck and hood area. Thinking maybe it rubbed on something funky in shipping I washed it again, but after pulling it out of the dryer and STILL smelling it I decided to throw it away. I contemplated returning it but beings that it took so long to arrive I figured I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time and you shouldn‚Äôt either!!"
1.0,Bad fabric. Too small.
1.0,Very displeased with this item I liked it so much but only within 1 to Chili's in metal faded and turning my wrist green and turned a copper color.
1.0,"Too Big!!! I am so sick and tired of claims that something fits small or is meant for a teenager or small adult. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù 115 lbs woman. This was huge on me. It was too big from top to bottom. It went so high that it was in my eye. When I pulled the toggles to adjust the ear straps, it made a big gap on the side of the cheek.<br /><br />In short, it does nothing for smaller people. Only recommend for 5‚Äô6‚Äù 150lbs +"
1.0,Very disappointed. Everyone of the balls are cracking and breaking
1.0,These things were way way too small. I have a 38 waist and got their 3x and it didn't come close to fitting.
1.0,"Tried these on and they were very uncomfortable - the center seam rides up! I even ordered and XL when I'm normally a size M. Maternity wear is supposed to be comfortable, and this definitely misses the mark."
1.0,Horrible quality. I would have sent them back but I was leaving for vacation and didn‚Äôt get a chance to send them. Do not buy! I wouldn‚Äôt give any stars if possible.
1.0,"Intended to wear this top today, but what I thought was a bit of lint turned out to be one of two holes melted into the fabric over the right breast, with a extended melt line nearly 2.5‚Äù long!<br />I‚Äôll be demanding a refund, but it makes no sense to send back, it‚Äôs ruined, and I don‚Äôt want it sold to another unsuspecting woman!"
1.0,Didn‚Äôt fit at all you have to be like a size 5 to put these pants on in a large
1.0,It's bad
1.0,En la primera puesta se rompi√≥ (y fue regalo) quede re mal
1.0,The color is off and the picture when ordering the breat area looks to be pleated on both sides. Don't order so disappointed. The dress looks unfinished in the breat area.
1.0,"Not recommend, practically broke after three days"
1.0,"Item not as described or as pictured. Item states ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù mesh flowers but there are no pearls. Also, headband shows 3 flowers with pearls. Item arrived with just 1 flower and no pearls. Very disappointed and poor quality."
1.0,Calidad fatal
1.0,üò†üò†
1.0,I bought these and sent to my aunt in New York so I could pack them for my trip back home from New York to trinidad.Suitcases looked great and was very impressed with how they felt and rolled when I compared to my husbands samsonite brand. When I got to Trinidad I inspected my suitcases and the zipper had broken off on the middle size. Very disappointed as I took a chance on this new brand based on the reviews.
1.0,"Cute but thin. After washing, the lint from the animal print material gets all over the pink cloth and is hard to come off."
1.0,cheap quality. you get what you pay for
1.0,I was so excited to get this product. Both my daughter and I we're going to use one since we both tend to fidget a lot. However when I opened it hers was more like a slap bracelet and mine used velcro to keep it shut but both of the velcros were the same side. They both had the hard side so it wouldn't attached. Sending it back sadly.
1.0,The jeans were very very cheap looking they look nothing like the picture  and the chains came off they fit funny not worth the money they are asking and they also have a funny smell to them
1.0,doesn‚Äôt really work stretches and will not hold your laces up shoe in place
1.0,size runs 2 sizes smaller
1.0,Awful!  Sleezy cheap material. Total waste of money.
1.0,"Would not recommend. I bought them because they said the jewelry was high quality stainless steel and I have a severe nickel allergy. Not even 10 minutes after putting one in, my entire nose is itching, burning, and my piercing is swelling and closing up.<br />After 30 minutes of trying to take it out because it's a giant pain to undo, I finally got it out and my piercing was bleeding and there's a rash inside in my nostrils.<br /> Will never trust this company again."
1.0,Not a fan. Too large and expensive.
1.0,"Ordered yellow with timer for $19.99 but received black with no timer...(priced at $15.99)...Yet I was charged $19.99. Attempted to exchange, called to speak with someone about this matter but only spoke with a man who barely understood English let alone spoke it!  As far as the product quality itself, not really impressed. Feels very cheap & toy like. It's just ok, nothing to write home about.<br />I would not recommend this product."
1.0,"Wrong color, cheap cap! Could have gotten the same thing @ Walmart much cheaper!"
1.0,This bracelet shown is a paved astor bangle and is not the bracelet youll recieve. A toggle chain is what you will get.
1.0,Cheap  Not soft like one i have just like it
1.0,"Ordered two of these, one for my daughter and one for myself.  My daughters zipper broke while still within the time line of returning for a refund.  Now the zipper in my coat broke, past the return time.  Very nice coat, but the zippers didn't last even 60 days."
1.0,IT DOES NOT WORK
1.0,It said fit as expected.  X large was more like a small.
1.0,There is no way the sizes are accurate
1.0,These don't do the job they are meant for. They don't stay up over the nose and mouth so don't buy them. Waste of money.
1.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù athletic build, the open sides didn‚Äôt fall on the right part of my torso‚Äî it was made for taller women with long torsos.  A shame because I was looking forward to wearing on vacation!"
1.0,The star is in the wrong position. I am not satisfied
1.0,They were way too big for me .. I had googled small brown dangle earrings ... nice quality for the price but large .. not my style
1.0,paper wallet the clip or flap isn't even magnetic. It holds one bill. Unacceptable
1.0,So uncomfortable it‚Äôs not even funny I send it right back
1.0,Wow i bought a large because i saw it ran small. i'm 5 1 and 130 pounds and it barley fits over my boobs. looks terrible! very sad
1.0,I am a size 10 or 12. I ordered a large. The top I received was labeled large however it was so small I couldn't even close it... My granddaughter is assized 7 I gave it to her...
1.0,Cheap looking--would not order if I had a second chance. Gold color dull.
1.0,"Did not have the message written, just said ‚Äúfashion jewelry‚Äù I wanted it mostly because of the cute message. Disappointing and not happy with the purchase. Don‚Äôt advertise the packaging if it‚Äôs not going to come with it? Is that too much to ask for?"
1.0,Absolute garbage. $32 for a bracelet that broke after 3 days. My girlfriend was wearing it just walking around the house over the weekend. I expect a replacement.
1.0,"The price substantially changed shortly after purchased.  I was ripped off.  They won't refund the difference and won't allow me to return it.  Horrible customer service.  The quality was also not of a good standard, especially not for what I paid for it.  I am very angry at the seller and at Amazon.  Their guarantee was worth nothing."
1.0,I returned this dress because it looks nothing like the dress in the picture.
1.0,"We left them on the table immediately after unpacking as part of our covid precautionary mesures. After 5 days, one  glass fell off. It turned out the frame around it broke without being touched or used for 5 days. Anohter one broke on first use. I'm not sure what the frames are made of but the quality is extremely bad. They are worse than the kids toy glasses which you can buy for $1. Save your money and time. Dont't even think about buying these glasses"
1.0,"This is not the color of the item!!!!!!! We have looked at it in the sunlight, led flashlight, bright room light etc. it is a dull blue gray from any angle. Beware!!!!"
1.0,These shoes were hard as rocks. Not flexible at all. My granddaughter hated them. Just stick with real crocs
1.0,They look great. Very light weight. If you have even a slight athletic build you will not like the fit. Tight on the legs and butt. Maybe a size up will fix that. These would probably be categorized as a Chino or slim fit.
1.0,"I was very excited to give this to my daughter for Christmas, since her loom bands are all over the house.  When I received the package, there was a large crack in the plastic and loom bands were EVERYWHERE!  They were in the shipping box, all of the colors had mixed together...  I lifted it by the handle (after ensuring the lid was clasped on) and the lid popped off and the loom bands went flying.<br /><br />This will not help contain the mess, this is going to make it worse.  Besides the fact that it's broken, this is a horrible product with a poor design."
1.0,"bad material, cheap"
1.0,Om is auspicious and shldnt be in anklet
1.0,I was excited about these shirts but the material is stiff and cheap feeling. They are very wrinkly and I‚Äôll fitting. I would not buy these.
1.0,Knockoff Chanel bag don't waste your time buying this! The logo is called Ohanel. If that wasn't on the purse I'd actually consider keeping it.
1.0,These sagged in the front for me and we‚Äôre not squat proof.
1.0,"We sized up as we were supposed to do, and it is still way too small. There was no way it was going to fit."
1.0,Didn't expect much from the price but immediately broke after taking it out of the package. Recommend wasting $5 on a hat or literally anything else instead
1.0,3 were broken when they arrived and they are heavy. Not sure if paying for postage is worth the hassle
1.0,I‚Äôm so disappointed of this item it‚Äôs not what it look like.
1.0,"I wore several pairs, and it's ok. I wouldn't repurchase them or give them as a gift. Disappointed!!"
1.0,It say 4 pack I only received one pair?
1.0,Cheap jewelry
1.0,Did not fit my Fiat key...and $5.99 to return...not even worth returning
1.0,"Beware, these are NOT men's t-shirts.  They are v necks that are very feminine and the fabric is very unusual- like a silky rayon.  They are more of a blouse than a men's t-shirt.  Extremely dissatisfied with this shirt- very disappointing."
1.0,Came untouched. The nose piece just didn‚Äôt feel right.
1.0,"Looks like a legit product but upon closer inspection, the gel padding inside is not the same."
1.0,"I had this on my wishlist for a little while and received it for Christmas as a gift. I was so excited! Then, I got home and opened it. It looked nothing like the photos. The material looked different, it didn't have a pocket on the front, it was sewn together crooked, there was a hole in the side of it, and it fit extremely awkward. Needless to say, it is on its way back to the vendor. üòï"
1.0,I dont believe it was a real sweet sweat. The box was opened when i received it. No gel. And the material was nothing like the one i had before. It didnt stretch. Cheaply made
1.0,Poor quality and color looked very different in person. Had to return.
1.0,"I saw they ‚Äúfit to size‚Äù unless your but doesn‚Äôt exist your crack will show. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 165 and ordered a medium, they did not fit, my wife who is way smaller than me said they were tight in her thighs, 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 135 and didn‚Äôt fit her butt either. I was disappointed."
1.0,I gave one star because the bag is super cute and a great size. I had to deduct 4 stars because the bag reeks of fish. I don't know any woman who wants to walk around smelling like fish. I tried half a bottle of Febreeze and washing it in my washing machine but the smell persisted. I will  have to return it.
1.0,"These were one of deals of day and I purchased them for $60. Few days ago saw them as groupon special for $10, same exact earrings. Be very Leary of the today's deals, some should really be labeled today's rip offs!"
1.0,This is a horrible dress don't waste your money.. im normally a size 4 and ordered the 8-10 based on the reviews of the dress running smaller and it still fit all wrong. It was loose in the chest but so tight around the waist and the buttons on this dress are made terribly. The fabric was not great either. Save yourself the aggravation and don't purchase this dress!
1.0,Product supposed to be 8 fits more like a 5-6 very disappointing.
1.0,This product was poorly made and too small. I ordered a size larger than I usually wear. Extremely disappointed.
1.0,"Using USB Mini B, really??"
1.0,"I don't know why I have made these foolish, unwise purchases"
1.0,None of the body jewelry was like the photos on line I didn‚Äôt get anything that could possibly fit me.
1.0,"Very cheap, the charm is big and the chain is tiny."
1.0,Broke within 1 hour.  Thankfully at home so I didn't loose my gear fit!  Not impressed
1.0,TERRIBLE ! CHEAP! SAVE YOUR MONEY !
1.0,Product is as describe. Shipped very fast . I‚Äôm displease at the selection . No matching colorful pairs. Gems and stone have fallen out .
1.0,very cheap Material
1.0,Very poorly made. The skirt is paper thin. Feels like you can rip it with little effort
1.0,Arrived broken with no option to return
1.0,not as depicted on line
1.0,"These came, I was really ecxited, but they are way too small. Luckily my kid could wear them"
1.0,The zipper broke the first time I tried to zip it. Very poor quality. Avoid.
1.0,"I loved the idea of this dress however the material is T-shirt like. Too causal to wear at events and it‚Äôs not flattering on my curvy, busty body."
1.0,This purse is nothing like I expected. I thought it would be a cute summer purse but it is a lot darker than the pictures. More of a fall/winter bag.
1.0,I‚Äôm normally a L/XL. I purchased XL & it wouldn‚Äôt zip. So I then returned it and purchase a 3XL & that one STILL wouldn‚Äôt zip. Sizes are not accurate at all!!
1.0,mehhhhhhhh
1.0,Odd fit.
1.0,Really weird fit... the shoulders don‚Äôt sit right and the sleeves open way too wide so they look goofy
1.0,"Not even close to being the right size...""Don't trust it!"""
1.0,The material is stiff and it's too large. I can't even wear this. It looks awful.
1.0,Was not what I expected this pendant was discoloured and did not reflect good quality.
1.0,"Very disappointed,  the clasp is made of plastic.  Same day after switching bands on my new smart watch (only had 2 months) I was leaving a concert once on the road 20 miles out I noticed my watch was missing from my wrist. Obviously the clasp was not durable.  I should have went with my instinct and returned back.  Don't buy!!"
1.0,"I ordered a MEDIUM size for me, 5‚Äô2 135lbs. Imagine my face when I took it out of the bag!! Then, the print and material quality is sooo cheap. Extremely cheap. I returned it ASAP."
1.0,"The picture shows more of a knit fabric, buts it‚Äôs actually more of a polyester that looks and feels a lot cheaper then the picture looks. I returned instantly"
1.0,"I wound the watch but could not get it to run.  Perhaps it just needed a new battery, but I am sending it back"
1.0,That it won't cover your private part so we'll the panty is uncomfortable to wear and the bra doesn't cover the boob properly.
1.0,Cup is no deep tried deep sizes and none fits good
1.0,This product if defective. I can‚Äôt slide the string to wear.
1.0,Quality of fabric was very poor looks nothing like the picture very cheap looking
1.0,Way to large and does not appear like on Amazon. Very cheap!!!
1.0,Bought for my sister's birthday but it was too cheap looking to give her .
1.0,[[VIDEOID:51c823645bc028e57bcb77ea6bbc7c3]]
1.0,"Watch doesn't work.  I wound it the first day and it worked for a while and I put it back in the box.  The next day, it wasn't working so I wound it a bit.  The second hand doesn't move.  Hasn't moved ever since.  Totally worthless as a watch."
1.0,Broke as I was putting it on for the first time. Too cheap. Not really worth it. I'd rather make my own.
1.0,wore it two days and already starting to fade
1.0,"Ordered a large and it barely fit a babydoll. Size up times 50,000! Returned"
1.0,"It‚Äôs true it‚Äôs too tight around the eye area. I couldn‚Äôt picture it and thought I would try since for most things I seem to have a small head. Also, the ears don‚Äôt line up and it came dirty. Yuck!"
1.0,"Picture looks 3d but keychain is actually flat. Not well made, broke the first day after light use. Put it on my shelf to try to fix at a later date, a few days later I noticed it was warped and mouth is peeling off. Not worth it."
1.0,"Good idea, extremely poor execution and cheap materials. Came no where near to resembling the advertised photo."
1.0,"I didn‚Äôt like the fabric, to flimsy. The skirt was uneven and it had slits on the sides, one side was higher then the other and I wanted a RED skirt and received a Burgundy color instead. The Black skirt I thought would be okay, but again it too was uneven and not enough material in the hem to be fixed. Sadly to say I threw than both in the Garage Can."
1.0,"I was hoping this would be a hidden gem, I couldn't find any other good leather bands for my 5s so I hopped on this bandwagon. The leather itself was pretty bad, very thin glued onto a thin sheet of plastic, and the actual metal clips ceased to be reliable yesterday after not even two weeks of use so, I cant even cut the sad leather off and repurpose them. Guess a metal band it is for me :("
1.0,Too big. Patterns are wrong. The skull face is sideways to the opening so it looks dumb
1.0,"Once again the size chart is way off. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù6‚Äù 220 mostly ass! I usually wear a xlarge in jogging suits. This xlarge was more like a medium. I gave it to my 15 year old daughter. The top runs super small it isn‚Äôt measured correctly far as size. The bottom looked super cheap, although it does have stretch. They were a lil big on my daughter around the waist. She likes baggy clothes so it was perfect for her. This seller need to update the size chart accordingly. These are ladies junior measurement. Very disappointing! FYI it won‚Äôt let you post weight over 215."
1.0,"This sweater is made of the cheapest, itchiest yarn - seriously used better stuff for arts and crafts as a kid. AND the ""brown"" one that is supposed to be a camel/cognac color...IS MADE OF ORANGE AND BLACK YARN. Sent back immediately, will find better for less at a local Old Navy or even Walmart."
1.0,Lense popped out the second I put them on!
1.0,I‚Äôm a 34 C wear a size small or extra small and this didn‚Äôt come close to any kind of support.
1.0,Too too small. You can't even return it back.
1.0,It was two sizes too small.
1.0,Stitching was ripped away from the shirt when I first got it.  It was cute but did not hold up to normal wear. Disappointed
1.0,Not designed for women with breast.
1.0,I am 6ft and it is really short on me. I returned it..
1.0,I was disappointed due to the size. One size fit most would fit a child not an adult.
1.0,"When my wife put it in a sink of cold water (no soap) as a first wash, it came out blotchy. It lost the color in several areas. Disappointing"
1.0,Beautiful fabric wish it fit! Runs small
1.0,Horrible.<br />It has been months and I have yet to receive this item. Don‚Äôt recommend.
1.0,"More Chinese Junk clothing.  A piece of junk, do not like it at all. Terrible.  It fist, so what?  It is otherwise useless.  Hood blows off in the wind.  Chin straps to supposedly hold hood on in windy weather NO GOOD, DOES NOT HELP.  Will never buy from this seller again.<br />Sorry I did.  Oh , not to mention , it took forever to get to me.  A DEFINITE NEVER AGAIN."
1.0,"Very short, not what I expected at all and I‚Äôm pretty petite, size 4, 5‚Äô0."
1.0,It broke within a week. VERY disappointed
1.0,"I thought this would be a pretty dress. But there is SO MUCH FABRIC in the arms and the top has an awkward fit. It's not flattering at all. I ordered the small and the fit is fine, just not flattering. It comes across as frumpy. The ruffle detail on the bottom of the skirt is cute, but I'll be returning this one."
1.0,"These are like a cardboard picture, I thought they were a plastic 3d item from the picture.  Disappointing"
1.0,DID NOT GET WHAT WAS ORDERED.
1.0,The fit was weird like the armpits were too low.
1.0,After being on for a few hours the button broke off my daughters top.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e7a2b7c404302c7ee563d044abe6380d]] I understand the shirt was only $22 but there‚Äôs better things on Amazon for 22 bucks<br />It also runs small not good for big and tall
1.0,Very thin & not good quality. üò¢
1.0,Too tight to put on.
1.0,Shirt wasn't what I expected... Especially the material. Shirt would look way better on a Skinner person than on someone trying to hide they're love handles or tummy.
1.0,"my wife bought these glasses and wore them for 1 day and they broke, on the left bottom right frame. dont buy!!!"
1.0,Didn‚Äôt notice it until I wore it but it had a hole around the armpit and I just noticed another one.
1.0,Earpiece fell off in the first 30 seconds. Apparently just pressed in place. Very fragile. Do not buy. Would give zero stars if possible.
1.0,90% of the rings broke.  Trash.
1.0,Today I received my order and was really excited about these earrings. I only received a clear bag with the product missing.
1.0,Way to small I ordered a med front too long back way short looks ridiculous
1.0,"Cheap material, poorly made. Not worth"
1.0,I bought this for my daughter who is having a hard time at school cause she misses her family. I thought this was a great way for her to have us with her. The chain broke the 1st time wearing it and she was devastated to say the least!! Luckly I had another chain but if you buy this you may want to by a better chain to go with it
1.0,Bad sowing of chest part. Some part are too tight while the other are loose and the sawing break loose at first try
1.0,The photo in the picture is Misleading. It fits like a small blouse
1.0,i didn‚Äôt like it at all ! size is too small !! not recommend
1.0,"Came all knotted up , don‚Äôt buy . This thing won‚Äôt undo from the knot It came in . It‚Äôs cheap and it‚Äôs worthless"
1.0,"The photography for this dress is somewhat misleading. Its more of a faded black. That and the material is very thin and thentype of material that wrinkles like crazy. Its listed as a retro rockabily type style, but really its more of sack. Its stitched well, but Im prolly going to seam rip it and create my own dress in the end. I recieved this product at a discount for my honest opinion"
1.0,"You get what you pay for.  My ankles had been swollen for several weeks to the point you couldn't see my ankle bone and compression socks were recommended by my physical therapist and family doctor.  The compression on the legs was about what I expected since I looked for ones that did not have the highest compression rating. The ankles were way too big, even for my swollen ankles.  Compression socks should have more compression at the ankles and gradually less as you move up the leg.  These socks barely touched my ankles.  Looked more like the &#34;elephant ankles&#34; I used to get with tights as a little girl."
1.0,they are to small for my feet and im a large according to you chart.
1.0,This dress fit nothing like the picture implies. In fact it didn't fit at all. I'm 5'5&#34; 150pds. I got a medium yellow. I would have needed to get an xlarge to even make this remotely possible. It looks like a Halloween costume.
1.0,"Broke within a couple of days.  Beautiful, but cheaply made."
1.0,Never got to wear them. Took out of package and it was broken.
1.0,"Wow are you kidding me?! Spoiler alert these dice are maybe 1/4 the size of the ones from the movie, not even kidding they're hilariously small. Do not buy. Ever."
1.0,The material was horrible!! It was paper thin it‚Äôs true you get what u pay for üòÇüòÇ
1.0,"Too small and cheaply made. I wear a size 12/14 and the one I got wouldn't fit a size 4! And, to get a refund, you have to pay shipping costs. Will never order from this company again!"
1.0,"So poorly constructed that I had to partially disassemble it to make it adjustable.  I could not be bothered to return it, so I am now in the process of sewing it back together.  An OK hat otherwise, kind of a faded indigo color.<br /><br />ETA:  The original problem was a blessing in disguise.  As I began the reconstruction I realized that my fingers now share the hat‚Äôs faded indigo color.  I am extremely fair-skinned with light-colored hair, so I can only imagine the result had I donned the cap and left home immediately.  I will see how many washings are required to stop its color-bleed.<br /><br />ETA:  One washing removed the excess blue dye."
1.0,"This item is very, very poor quality. It is ill fitting, and made of the very cheapest materials (It's dollar store bad). My clapped out 20 year old camel back with a leaky bladder is in better shape than this brand new item. Even the stuff they sell at wally world is much better fit and quality AND costs less than this. The elastic bands are very weak, like they are already stretched and worn out. It doesn't sit on the shoulders or chest correctly. Even when the chest strap is cinched all the way in, it is still too wide, and I am a very wide man. The &#34;nylon&#34; is stiff and loud. The bottom of the shoulder straps attach over the belt strap, so the zipper pockets are blocked. The belt strap adjustment is awkward. the bottom of the bladder pocket isn't insulated, so heat will rise into the bag and warm the bladder. The bladder lid is hard to screw on. Even the stitching is poor.<br /><br />I'm shocked that ANYONE gave this piece of junk a positive review. It actually makes me question the efficacy of Amazon reviews."
1.0,the post were curved  more than shown in picture and something is not right about the sterling silver as I can wear sterling silver but these bothered my ears from the moment I put them on --Would Not recommend --The only positive is they are very pretty and small like they said- to bad they cannot be worn
1.0,"I Purchased The Garnet Earrings, Received Them On Tuesday, October 23, 2018 And When I Went To Put Them On Today (10/28/2018) The Post Broke."
1.0,Item is not as described in picture. Not a round Steelers logo but one the says Steelers. Very misleading.
1.0,Cheap material and poorly made. Looks nothing like this photo! I rarely give a poor rating-but this was awful.
1.0,"The metal bars that insert into the watch are too long for the watch face and after having it for 1 month, 1 side busted off."
1.0,It just pulls apart does not stay locked.  Very disappointef
1.0,they run really small. First time I wore them the tap tore off.
1.0,"Took it out of the box, went to put it on for the first time, and the metal clasp instantly came off. If you‚Äôve seen the movie ‚ÄúJingle All the Way‚Äù, it was like the scene where Howard opens the Turboman from the Santa Black Market and it completely falls apart."
1.0,Got a totally different style
1.0,poor thing
1.0,Returned...to small
1.0,Might fall apart the first time I wash it!
1.0,The bracelet didn't even last 3 months. I was jogging and the bracelet broke. Poor quality
1.0,"I HATE THESE!<br />They sit on my face unlike any other sunglasses that I have ever put on.<br />They tilt backwards at the top, making it possible for me to put my hand under them on the bottom while touching my eyebrows.<br />I know that they are only $10, so I shouldn't expect them to be AMAZING, but I didn't expect them to be complete garbage either.  I will be going to Marshalls and buying a pair for $10 that is actually worth the $10.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE!"
1.0,"I could not get this to stay on.  I have another brand of adhesive bra that works just fine, but this one slips off after 5 minutes."
1.0,glasses are junk lenses fall out very easily poorly built.
1.0,Cheap and cheesy - very small
1.0,"I've ordered these glasses twice. The first time they were great. Several months later, the frames smell like some sort of noxious petroleum product I find many cheap sunglasses smell like. Since they sit right on my nose, I can't avoid the smell and it begins to make me nauseous. I returned the second pair I bought, but the first pair were fine. Too bad they started using inferior plastic in the frames. Very disappointed."
1.0,I received this item yesterday in the mail. A plastic billy club for my son who is 5 and likes to dress up as a police officer. Package was handed directly to me. Nothing damaged on the box. I opened it up he was so excited and it was broken. I had to put black electrical tape around it. For me to get refunded I would have to send this one back and it‚Äôs so not worth my time and energy. Highly disappointed!
1.0,Don't Buy. It arrived all wrinkled in a bag. The fabric is terrible. I ordered XL and they sent XXXL but the sleeves are small.
1.0,Shirt had a hole so I'm sending it back
1.0,More like silicon instead of leather. Not the same as shown in the picture.
1.0,The watch & packaging are visually aesthethicaly impressive. Not as impressive once you actually held it in your hands. The knob feels like it's partially slipping as you turn it. Not as solid as a real Japan made seiko 5.
1.0,The item is too small and tight on my face.I need a bigger size.I opened the item first time yesterday since I bought.I don't need refund only exchange.Seller is not understanding.
1.0,broke immediately.  Returning
1.0,IT took almost a month to get from the seller.  This is an iron on transfer and it wasn‚Äôt even center in the short.  There were stains on the short as well.
1.0,"when I got the it the zipper was broke, and it was horrible"
1.0,This description  was not at all correct. This was too dainty  for a man to wear..chain was not 24inches. It was not even comfortable on my neck. Sorry do not recommend.
1.0,I cleaned them with some tissue now they're all scratched up. Lasted about two weeks.
1.0,It smelled  horrendous like trash  it looked  it was big it is small
1.0,I got a ugly grey jersey.....so annoyed
1.0,Not at all like pictures. Too small and terribly made
1.0,"Way too baggy, flimsy and cheap."
1.0,Ridiculously small like for child arm
1.0,"Cheap, awful and uncomfortable. The fabric is chinsey, the print is poor quality and it‚Äôs even messed up. Not worth $5 let alone $20."
1.0,"I bought these for my daughter and I think within a week all of the socks have wholes in them! She‚Äôs just a typical kid, but this thin material didn‚Äôt last! I wouldn‚Äôt buy them again!"
1.0,"SUPER thin, good for summer I guess, pocket, no polo logo.  Not questioning its authenticity, but without the iconic logo, might as well be a $10 Walmart shirt."
1.0,Awful. Size was WAY too small. It looked like a children‚Äôs shirt. And it came in blue instead of black like it was advertised. -2/10
1.0,Not velvet and doesn't tie correctly. Substandard product. Sorry do not recommend!
1.0,"Awful! After ONE wear tarnished , on all of them! Very sad because they are super cute."
1.0,These are really bad.  They cause blurriness and headaches.  Really poorly constructed too.  Don't waste your money
1.0,I wear a size 26/28 so I figured a 5x would be big enough. I ordered the green and white but what I got was blue and pink. The dress size was more like a 1x. I was very disappointed. Just make sure you know when ordering the clothes they're sizes are in Asian.
1.0,"Lacking in many ways:  no users manual (but there were 2 band link removers), the hands were not glow in the dark, the watch lost 3 hours every night, although I did not take it off at night.  I loved the look and feel of it, but hey....it didn't keep time and I require that of my watch!  With no user's manual, I am not sure if I was supposed to do something special to it to make it keep accurate time.  It had lots of clear plastic tape protecting the band, so I know it was not used.  Be careful...they do sell used ones and I would not want you to get mine."
1.0,Well made but size is way too small
1.0,It looks good. Colors are vibrant.  Very thin material.  There isn't ounce of elastic anywhere in that shirt.  Women with hips should shop elsewhere.
1.0,breaks the fasteners almost every time regardless of care taken or fabric type.  Just not a durable/usable product.
1.0,Feel cheap and disappointed.
1.0,"Material is horrible, returned it."
1.0,I don‚Äôt know if is because the bar is to long or the hand is too big. Maybe a combination of the two but it does not stay upright with the hand over the lip and I do not have small lips. I didn‚Äôt even wear it a full day.
1.0,The idea of the dress is cute a bat print a line with a wrap top you‚Äôd think the material would be cotton but you get it and it‚Äôs a shiny stretchy and thin almost swimsuit material fabric very reminiscent of a WISH dress very cheap fabric for 18$ you‚Äôd expect something decent mine came with loose strings and an odd smell
1.0,[[VIDEOID:770c3d3d5ab2f12e2b59fea836fb56ea]] I haven't even tried the product yet! As when I received and opened to try hair started falling out & both my husband and I looked at each other like was this uses?? I pulled it out more & more black long human hair & gray hair coming out I pull out more and see the velcro is covered to! As if someone used it or tried it on? Idk? But it's pretty gross!
1.0,The fabric had several vey noticeable flaws. I was sadly disappointed.
1.0,"I am 5‚Äô3, 130lbs and ordered a medium for my athletic build. I have some muscular thighs but these just did not do them any justice. The top was fine, but the shorts were crazy small."
1.0,"This vendor is using a stock photo and the actual item looks nothing like what I received. Returned immediately.<br />Cheap, misshapen, unappealing, used?<br />Just NO"
1.0,Tie is not light grey.  Its very much beige.  Went up to Kohls and grabbed a light grey tie for comparison.
1.0,"I'm 125 pounds, 5'2, usually a size small or 4.<br />I bought a size up (medium) as previous reviews suggested. But this is basically a children's skirt. It stayed up around my thigh!!! When I sucked in and pulled it up over my hips to my waist, I could hardly stand it. If you are going to order this anyway, AT LEAST get two sizes up, if not three!"
1.0,"Very hard, small inside.. looks stylish but very impractical"
1.0,The design is completely blacked out and can‚Äôt see the design clearly
1.0,So from everything I have read Andrew reviews about these Oakley‚Äôs they are not the real official Oakley‚Äôs they do not have the Oakley stamp or serial number on them so why would you sell these thats faults advertisement
1.0,LOOks cheap
1.0,light stop blingking
1.0,Very disappointed in the size differences!! Not near as pretty as the pictures
1.0,Did not make sound or light up! Back of tie was already frayed when opening the package.
1.0,"I saw this bag and thought the black camouflage was as cute as could be.And it was when it arrived. But imagine my disappointment when the bag broke the first time I used it. It wasn't overloaded. In fact, the tiny bag is surprisingly roomy and the bag wasn't even full. The stitching for the gold ring that the strap attaches to wasn't done well and gave out. It was just poorly constructed. And it would probably cost as much as I paid for the bag to return it. Hopefully, my shoe shop can stitch it back together. I would not recommend this product or even this brand."
1.0,Unfortunately this watch was just to small for my 10 year old.  I had to send back and order a men's watch.
1.0,I got the light pink one and it came in white. After just a couple of days using it the longer strap broke.
1.0,It says 6 pairs and I only got 3.
1.0,It broke the next day. :(
1.0,Watch broke after 11 days. Which was really disappointing because it was a special watch from Santa Claus.
1.0,This coat was just not a good fir. Think it was designed on an Asian model.
1.0,"Can't use the sunglasses, the nose pads have caused indentations and scrapes on my nose."
1.0,"When they finally arrived it was clear that the size the sent was going to be way too small.  Before buying I checked the size chart which is clearly for very tiny people, and even then they would have to go up several sizes.  I will be returning and not buying again."
1.0,The masks eyes were cut out by scissors and very poorly at that.  The pants had runs in them not even wearable.  Three different sizes when I ordered one size I got a extra large a 2X and 3X..... The shirt was a 3X... the best ways a L.....the pants were 3x....the jacket was a 2x.  Do not recommend buying this outfit from this seller
1.0,"These pants are very poorly made.  The material is extremely cheap and see-through.  It is poorly sewn, and there is absolutely no stretch at all in the material.  The size chart is completely off as well."
1.0,Ordered 1 size up from my regular size after reading the comments.  The 2X I ordered was more like a medium.
1.0,When I washed these the rubber lining shredded away.  A total wreck.  Seller unresponsive to me.
1.0,"Can't recommend this one.  Fabric is super thin, seams don't match up at all."
1.0,I'm pretty sure these are made of sweat suit material. Felt fine when tried on inside. Wore outside in 80degrees and my instantly started sweating profusely.
1.0,Love the look and fit was perfect for Xmas day but the red is bleeding all I‚Äôve the Whitley ball tassel..... I‚Äôm sure if I wash it will all become pink<br />Very disappointed!
1.0,Got BLACK
1.0,Waist belt pockets was upside down but I did not have time to return it before our hiking trip.
1.0,Way too big! Should have paid attention to measurements.
1.0,"very small top, large pants<br />Awful purchase<br />Do not recomend"
1.0,very thin and hood does not stay on
1.0,"This item didn't even come completely done.  The straps to put them on are not even connected.  You either have to sew it or tie it, which the former takes a lot of time and the latter looks horrible."
1.0,Does not even begin to fit can‚Äôt find how to send it back
1.0,This makes me look like a chef..
1.0,Picture was very deceiving.  It's very cheaply made. Hat is felt-like & flimsy. My teenage daughter did not like it.
1.0,"This bra is the best fitting and most comfortable bra I have ever had.  I ended up buying 6 of them.<br /><br />That said, after about 2 months the wires on all of them started coming out.  My husband snipped the wires to make them shorter and I sewed them back in.  I wont be buying them again."
1.0,Got an XL and all the tags match up but it's at XS like my little sister could wear this. Really disappointed because it's so cute but sports bras are to keep everything together I ordered one size bigger just in case and it was 4 times to small do not recommend unless your so flat chested you don't need it for its purpose and just for the cute looks!
1.0,Item very very small.  Bought 4x for layering nope  fit like xl 18-20.  The item arrived dirty.  Husband thought I bought used coat.  Was terrified of the journey this coat had and repackaged item for next day pick up.  Rate a zero
1.0,It‚Äôs pretty but hold only for few days as the stone easily detached from the ring.
1.0,The smell was horrible. I could not use it nor could I sell it because of how bad the odor was. I tried to wash it and do what I could to get rid of the smell but it still came through.
1.0,Shoes keep falling off the velcro won‚Äôt stick
1.0,I purchased a large an it fit like a small. Also when you put it in it looks faded when stretched. Not worth buying unless you‚Äôre extremely small otherwise don‚Äôt waste your money.
1.0,Received wrong color but kept it anyway
1.0,"I loved this kimono in the picture and wanted to love it in person. Chiffon? No. The material is awful. It is 100% polyester. I have other kimonos that are polyester and they are still sheer, light and flowy. This material is not sheer or flowy at all, nor is it breathable. It  was full of static when I took it out of the packaging. It is also short and boxy. On the model, it looked like boho perfection. On me, it looked like a grandma episode of What Not to Wear. This was a real boho no-no for me.<br />Would NOT recommend."
1.0,Watch ALL clothing on Amazon!  It all comes fron China & is made VERY small or VERY large.  I get exercise clothing that is 1/2 size it should be & dresses that are 2x the size they should be.  I'll NEVER order clothing from Amazon again.  They are running tight with the Chinese & I'll NEVER be OK with that!!!
1.0,These shorts BARELY qualify enough to be considered ‚Äúhigh waisted‚Äù
1.0,"**UPDATE: After 2 months of use, the shorts have some seam unraveling, and runs in the material. You‚Äôre better off spending more $$ to get a name brand**<br /><br />For the money, these are good shorts. The fit is ‚Äòas expected‚Äô except in the rear. The tend to sit a little low in the caboose. The fit everywhere else is great and they are comfortable. No issues with seams or rough areas. They are quite thin, which is one of the reasons I tried them. They are great for those hot days."
1.0,I have always worn a XL dress. This one was way to skinny and small.
1.0,Not happy with my purchased<br />Glasses still gets foggy.<br />Very dissatisfied with my purchased
1.0,"The looks of the purse is underwhelming, In the picture it looked like the outside of the bag was like suede. It is actually faux leather looking.<br /><br />Very cheap looking"
1.0,Fits very tight. Lost feeling in my fingertips.
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this.  It was a father's day present for my husband. However, within a week it started falling apart; I fixed it and thought it was no big deal.  But now within less than a month all the charms have fallen off at least twice and now there almost no charms on it."
1.0,"The watch is not suitable for kids, I would even say it‚Äôs dangerous... it gets really hot, not safe.<br />I don‚Äôt know if I got a defective one, but I‚Äôll be returning as soon as I get home from out Christmas vacation... also, it turns on and off by itself"
1.0,It's not very bright and polished and indeed it is very small. I have tiny eats and it scrunched it up and pulled the lobe up wards.  It is for a young child. I even tried to bend it nicely to see if I could  expand the size. .......hah.....a Crack immediately appeared right above the x. Very disappointed
1.0,Inaccurate product description.  Ran large not small and only received one of the 3.
1.0,Of o could give negative stars I would. The color is not black is like A very dark faded horrible green and the colors are not vibrant at all. The quality is like someone stitched this in the bathroom with no lights on. The neck collar is missing stitching. It‚Äôs just poorly made and not actual representation of the picture.
1.0,I purchased a large since it said fit smaller but I couldn't even button the jacket. Came folded in a plastic bag and was deep wrinkled. No way that the sizing is correct. Very disappointed!
1.0,Lens began to delaminate and now are cloudy after 2 months. Would not recommend.
1.0,Horrible shirt. Looks like a child made it.
1.0,"These glasses are extremely cheaply made. I realize they are only ten dollars, but the lenses came scratched and then the frame around the lens cracked within 10 hours of wearing them. I would not recomend these to anyone, pick up a crappy pair of glasses off a street corner for 5 bucks instead."
1.0,fell apart on my face and when I contacted QUAY's customer support they said they could do nothing
1.0,"Didn‚Äôt come with the belt. Very unfortunate, as you need the belt to style the dress. Looking through other reviews I see this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened. Seller should be ashamed of themselves."
1.0,"Too short, had a &#34;run&#34; first time wearing them.  Useless."
1.0,Bonito el modelo pero la calidad de la tela es demasiado fina.
1.0,It was not at all what I expected!
1.0,These pants are not made for an adult.
1.0,No they did nat. They are extra to thins and the robber bans ateto week for the recuirements in Rh OR.
1.0,Strap retention loop broke first day.<br />Entire strap seems flimsy
1.0,These pants are not palazzo pants! I don‚Äôt remember their fit in relationship to your questions above.  They were pretty much straight legged. No way palazzos
1.0,It's way too big for me even on the smallest loop
1.0,Pretty dress but its too thin you can see thru it.
1.0,Would be great jacket if spelled right
1.0,Yo miro 1.66cm ypeso 70kg y la talla L es grande .. es mejor una talla M.. es muy grande y la tela no es dura ... no da una forma bonita y la el√°stica es muy d√©bil ...no es muy c√≥moda para correr ya que no tiene un buen soporte el√°stico
1.0,This top online looks perfect but ithe lace n the material have two diff navy color
1.0,The material these shirts are made of are cheap looking and of similar texture as women‚Äôs panty hose. They are nothing like the shirts seen in the photos. Don‚Äôt waste your money on them.
1.0,Does not fit well at all.  Makes you look very heavy.  Not pretty like it shows in your picture
1.0,"The pendant is very small, certainly not worth the price I paid for it"
1.0,Horrible very poorly made. Super cheap material and terrible cut.
1.0,"Of the 40 units that were sent, less than 1/2 worked and even less than that stayed together.  It isn't worth the money or the product that was used to put together.  No one should spend their money on these!  I'm just sorry that we did.  Never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"Nice jacket, but...‚Ä¶..My daughter instructed me to buy a SMALL for her, and when she got it, it was a little too tight.  I figured I could simply exchange it for a MEDIUM, and move on.  Nope, had to return it for credit ($179.95), then REPURCHASE it ($239.95)! For some reason, this just doesn't seem right to me.  Thanks, a lot."
1.0,So ugly and cheap looking.
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture... no jogger bottoms, color was WAY off, look and felt like pj pants! I do not advise!"
1.0,I returned it. I‚Äôm a plus figure (Size 16) and this felt like I had a bed sheet on. It probably looks cute on small girls.
1.0,Bought the items i tried to use on Sunday for the first time and it wet my entire kitchen floor<br />It is leaking
1.0,The material is easy to wrinkle. And it‚Äôs not very flattering to my body type. Not great quality
1.0,product is not true to size and is smaller than what I normally wear.
1.0,"The fit was big on me and the material cheap cery costume like. Think like polyester fabric. Not good quality, I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,"I got the wrong style and color, I ordered the blue one the cold shoulder shirt sleeves,  and I got an spaghetti strap brownish color dress.üò•üòîüòï"
1.0,I thought I returned this item!  My husband is in a Nursing Home and the material was too heavy.<br /><br /> Please check to see if it was returned.<br /><br />Thank you!!!
1.0,I bought this for my daughter for Valentine's day she's 11 so this ring didn't see any harsh cleaning products and within 2 days all the silver besides the top had faded off and left a rusty looking color ring underneath...
1.0,"Advertised as size 13. Yeah, maybe size 13 in China, way to small for my big American feet! Returned."
1.0,"Do not get these!! They are extremely hard to put in, they are even harder to get out. Do not waste your money!"
1.0,i thought these looked realy nice. wen i got tem i tryed taking the back off of one. the back was on there tight. te whole stud broke off and i never got te back off
1.0,Used them once and the crotch ripped out.  Very low quality!!!  Very disappointed.
1.0,It came ripped and the size was too small.
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy this product. It doesn‚Äôt work. It falls apart  only hours after used. No worth the money. They look pretty but quality is very bad.
1.0,Ordered this product and its entirety too small. Contacted seller about returning it and the seller seems more interested in emailing Amazons policies rather than taking it back.
1.0,"I thought these were so cute. I bought them last year, but they got put away in the attic before I could even wear them. Brought them out this year. Wore each of them THREE times only, and look how much pattern has worn off. Very very disappointed."
1.0,"its just ok. Not much give to it. washed in cold and shrunk . Was hoping to at least be able to maybe wear it for everyday, but not now. I would say order 2 sizes up."
1.0,Very disappointed. Loved them at first but they didn't last a week. The lens separates from the shell and leaks water.
1.0,NOT sparkly.  Satiny fabric with purple splatter pattern to give illusion of sparkles.  Photo is very deceiving.  It is so big from top to bottom that it can cover your entire face.  Total waste of money.
1.0,The knife  is tio big
1.0,Much smaller than I thought it would be
1.0,"I‚Äôm a big guy, 18‚Äù neck<br />These are ridiculous<br />Made for a child‚Äôs neck"
1.0,Couldn‚Äôt pull it over my chest! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1.0,"This is my 2nd review. Turns out the the dress did not fit. I took it to the cleaners to see if I needed any alterations on it and it would not close to allow her to zip it up. So that was money wasted. It is definitely not ""True to Size"" it was way to small. It's too late for me to return it. So, I will take that loss and never order from you guys again. I'm very leary on ordering clothes off of Amazon now. You just can't trust the description on these clothes on this website."
1.0,Quality of ink print is bad and fits small
1.0,Its not real sterling silver. I was disappointing with it. I bought 2 and my husband tried to polish his and it tornished.
1.0,Sent it back. Fit was horrible and terribly difficult to put on.
1.0,This jacket keeps licking all the fiber.  I have tried everything and unfortunately I threw out the return bag so I‚Äôm stuck with it.  This is one of the worst products I‚Äôve ever bought on Amazon.  My car is filled with the duck fiber and the other material they put inside.
1.0,Was so small wouldn't fit a small 45 year old woman
1.0,My hair was a mess after sleeping with this cap.  I have very curly hair.
1.0,The bands to hold tightly with the watch. They come unhinged easily.
1.0,I had this charm for about a week and the ring part that goes on the necklace bent and then broke.
1.0,I was REALLY hoping this would be a cute dress.  The pattern is great but the size and fit are horrendous.  The fabric is so thin it doesn't lay well and the wrap ties don't even work.  There is a snap that forces the neck together at an odd location and it doesn't lay well.
1.0,The liner ripped after 3 weeks
1.0,"The material is horrible and very itchy. I tried washing it since sometimes that helps, but it did not."
1.0,I ordered an XXL and it would fit like a regular small. I‚Äôm giving it to my mom who is 5‚Äô2 and 110 pounds. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Gave as a gift to 20 year old daughter.  Item handled with care,  however tail snapped off within first few hours."
1.0,Im usually too lazy to write reviews on stuff . But this bag smelled a bit bad when i first opened it. Also the material its made from felt a bit cheap . Its almost like a faux leather material and i was just left with little holes as soon as i put my pins in it then tried to remove so i can move them around. Definitely not worth 20$.
1.0,I couldn't use any time. For first time it's belt brokeüëé
1.0,The only reason I bought these laces were because they were supposed to be &#34;bright lime&#34;.<br /><br />They are more like army green. A very dark green. Similar to that found in camouflage.<br /><br />Not worth the money!!
1.0,Smaller than I thought and the colors are not flattering. Will be returning.
1.0,they fit real small and tanglely on the inside.  Not a good buy for me.  I tried one pair and now they are all sitting around waste of money
1.0,This hat came squished in a box and is deformed and the size is for a giant adult head. Looks ridiculous.
1.0,terrible! cant believe anything could be so cheap. as soon as i got them i opened them to 3 already broken<br />thinking it was just shipping i put them in and they were breaking as i was wearing them . the cheapest plastic iv ever seen<br />do not purchase unless u want junk.
1.0,They are very cute just they break very easy when I first got mine I put one on and i stretched it a little to put it on and immediately broke also the butterfly‚Äôs keep falling off so i would not recommend
1.0,I was so disappointed when I received these socks (I ordered the dog ones) which were a gift for a friend and opened them up to find out they had numbers stamped on the tops of the feet. This is not displayed in any of the product pictures. They look so tacky with those numbers!!<br />I had bought this same design previously from a different seller for my daughter and they did not have the tacky numbers on them so I'm not sure why these do?! Very disappointed!
1.0,"If you want to purchase this piece of fabric, order one size up if you are curvy.<br />This is now swimsuit material. It feels like a silky shirt or table cloth. Just horrible."
1.0,"They were nice, but they came with different saying instead of mother and daughter"
1.0,"Way too small, maybe a size 6 and I am a size 14! I couldn't even put one leg in it."
1.0,They look worn. There are indents in the materials. One ankle fits tighter than the other with the same buckle placement. Unacceptable.
1.0,Clasp is too small/tight for me to latch.
1.0,Poor quality. Inside lining ripped after one month.
1.0,"Unfortunately the old rule my mom used to say, you get what you pay for. These are great for one or two time use. My four year old son loves bow ties for some reason so he wanted to wear them a couple times a week but two have already come untied after being worn once . :( if you are looking for an outfit and consider the other a bonus, go for it but if you want some solid kids bow ties, find another."
1.0,Too small for price.
1.0,Caused irritation in my daughters nose.
1.0,This is absolutely ridiculous ! I wore these maybe 3 times at the most! Today I look down and notice the entire piece that felt like blown glass and what I thought I was getting was actually just a sticker that was extremely poorly stuck on the ear ring obviously! I thought it was a single piece of blown glass but instead it‚Äôs a poor imitation that has plastic stuck to them .DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I may have gotten eight hours of use out of these ear rings and now I have two clear ear rings that are absolutely worthless and a piece of plastic that fell off that‚Äôs the supposed blown glass part!
1.0,"Got a small, still too big.  Not a dress for petites ladies"
1.0,Arms too short.  Fit is not good.  Around the collar is weird.  I am unhappy that I have to pay to return it.
1.0,Great design - awful quality.
1.0,Turned my finger green. Very cheap ring
1.0,The only thing I like is the color! I normally wear a 2x so to be safe I ordered a 4x. I ordered it on 9/27/22 & just received it today 10/20/22! It was truly not a 4x and is half as long as the picture presented on Amazon! I sent two emails and asked for a refund one time I believe but haven‚Äôt got one. So disappointed.
1.0,"These shirts are light weight, NO SUPPORT, they are junk"
1.0,"very ugly, do not resemble the photo so I had to return but they fit true to size"
1.0,Waaaay too tiny
1.0,This cardigan feels like it was made from steele wool.
1.0,The model is beautiful as I expected but the size is too big.
1.0,Hard to get credit card out. Didn‚Äôt like it at all. Who ever made it should of tried it first.
1.0,wont fit...too tight
1.0,This is a plated item as my skin literally got hot and spit it out by melting it through the skin. This MUST say plated and not charge you 100.00 for something that is really cheap in comparison and now my belly button is ruined from being burned through by CHEAP metal.
1.0,I'm glad we let her wear it before we washed it so we at least got a good picture of her in the dress...before the color completely faded after the first wash. We wash all out clothes in cold water with gentle detergent...never seen any clothes lose color immediately like this. She is heartbroken because she loved her Buzz dress.
1.0,I love the soft material and they fit my post-baby body fairly well. My complaint is that after two washes tiny holes started to appear in the material. I‚Äôm very disappointed.
1.0,"Impossible to put the ball on, it rubbed my lip sore and made a line indent in my lip that bleed, buy cautiously."
1.0,"I had read a few other reviews and I thought I'd still give these earrings a try despite the negative comments. But they are very sharp. The posts are square, and when I inserted them into my piercing it was painful. I was hoping that wearing them for a bit would make it better, but my ears were sensitive the entire time, and it hurt to take them out as well. I will never wear these earrings. It's too bad because they look exactly like what I wanted."
1.0,"Fuzzy texture to the photo and the backpack is the absolute CHEAPEST material you will ever see. Bought this for my elementary school child and I can say: the only way this backpack is gonna last until December is because we aren‚Äôt even having school in session (thanks Covid!) Otherwise, it would rip and tear within the first week. Absolutely not worth the money."
1.0,100% would not recommend.
1.0,One of them (i order 2) fall apart. The 2nd one i am afraid to use cause it may fall apart to. Pay a little more for a better bracelet
1.0,ripoff
1.0,This is a hat for a chilly day. Not for a sunny day
1.0,The ring is not a solid circle. Has a separation on the base. Pictures DO NOT reflect the actual ring. Not worth it.
1.0,It was not a large.
1.0,"Nice product, just wasn't true to size."
1.0,Pretty but cheap looking -
1.0,Received the top with no bottoms. Big boobie girls- these cups are very small and will expose you.
1.0,Not good quality returned very satisfied with customer service and hassle free return
1.0,Bought an XL. Just barely fit over my chest and is very short plus tight. Was told I looked like I was wearing a kids shirt.
1.0,"It runs really small. Waited a long time to get this white sports bra, then I was very disappointed."
1.0,"The product was not as described. It was suppose to come with a set of 5. I very specifically looked for the set of 5. Only received one. Seller quickly refunded my money and only charged for 1. However, I was bummed...it was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. Anyway, the SINGULAR sushi cat is cute and well made. It is used as a keychain and does well. Just beware that you will never get an order of 5, even if it says it comes with it."
1.0,"Jeans are definitely not as pictured. They run huge, the fabric is cheap and not cute at all when you get them."
1.0,Very different color than it looks.  Waistband is unattractive.
1.0,Didn‚Äôt work and no option to return them.
1.0,"This ""wrap"" is a cheap piece of white fabric with a blurry photo of leaves printed on it. There is no black, just various degrees of purple. Not at all what is represented in the photo. I would not recommend."
1.0,"Bought this for a mother day gift !  But low and behold it's the Wrong Color,  I thought it looked good"
1.0,Didn‚Äôt get them received an empty package.
1.0,I used them for my teeth but they are fake o didn‚Äôt really know until they start tuning sliver
1.0,Very disappointed that this is not real leather at all. That was the whole reason I purchased this item. It‚Äôs clearly vinyl and looks super cheap.
1.0,"Weird material, looked and felt like it was made from a tablecloth. Nothing like the photo. Waited over a month to receive this item as well."
1.0,"Purchased an 8 pack. Two of the bands were broken. The other 6 are very hard to slide into the watch. Contacted Amazon for a replacement, unfortunately this seller does not provide replacements. Only option is to return the product."
1.0,Waaaaaaay undersized. I ordered by the sizechart and the pants aren't half as big as they advertised. The pants are also very short.
1.0,Needed this asap and it‚Äôs incorrect.
1.0,"The top is not meant for a women with breasts, anything more than a 32C and you  should look elsewhere."
1.0,The top is too large to be a small.
1.0,"Materials and workmanship is low level even for low level jacket. Sized for short chubby person with tiny hands. I am 5.11 167 lbs and since jacket runs small, I ordered one size larger to what I normally wear. Hand sleeves are too short and torso is too wide. Pocket holes don't fit my average sized hands."
1.0,why
1.0,Terrible quality....so disappointed...
1.0,The shirts were marked 2x but they were actually size large they did not fit we ended up giving them away
1.0,Gloves didn‚Äôt work as they were too wide for child hands
1.0,"My son got this for his Halloween costume. We made sure it worked when it arrived, which it did. We turned it off and put it away until Halloween. He put it on for Halloween and it broke. Garbage. Buyer beware."
1.0,"Returned this after a day of wear, it had sharp edges along the inside where the nylon for the keeper was joined and where the main strap was connected to the buckle, both of which scratched the inside of my wrist."
1.0,"returned: to small fit funny, and was see through!!"
1.0,"One fell off me and I didn't realize, so now I am without a pair. Disappointed with purchase."
1.0,I ordered a large and received a 2x much to big. Wrong size.
1.0,"I bought to replace the flimsy, easily slipping buckle on my backpack waist strap, but there isn't enough clearance to pass any webbing through on one side of the buckle! I have pics, and will post as soon as I can figure out how to."
1.0,when i got it the lunchbox zipper was placed upside down so i had to unsew it and sew it again. the backpack strap thread kept on ripping off so i had to sew it multiple times. its not the best quality
1.0,The color is ugly
1.0,Looks very cheap and fit awful
1.0,Don‚Äôt buy from this company or the product. It took 2 months for my product to arrive and when I revived it it doesn‚Äôt fit right at all. Cheap product and company
1.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but it's too big. I wish it came in an extra small. Beautiful color"
1.0,"Shirt has two very very very narrow lines for the ered stripes and six inches of white space, Lazily put together and uber uber deep blue not a washed faded look like the photo nor are the stripes proportioned like the photo"
1.0,Don't waste your time. The item is not a brown recluse as claimed. False just as other reviewers stated.
1.0,"Poor Quality!!!! Lasted one whole day with back falling off and disappearing along with battery!!! RIDICULOUS....MIGHT AS WELL CARRY A BAT, more reliable!!!!!"
1.0,This dress has a really odd fit. the skirt part seems to  be sewn incorrectly. It is unwearable
1.0,Stones were not even all around and overall looked cheap. Returned them.
1.0,This charm doesn't look like the picture of it.
1.0,I don‚Äôt have a giant head but this was tiny. I hate when they‚Äôre so tight. Yes they‚Äôre supposed to be when working out but this was so tight it even triggered a migraine from the pressure. I like the buttons on the temples for masks though.
1.0,Well don't wipe them off or there goes the picture on them! I guess they worth money if you don't care about choosing not to wear in the rain because I don't think they'd survive.
1.0,"The gold is molded over some type of material -with a density as heavy as concrete - which makes them too heavy to comfortably wear.  I wore them while shopping, but removed them after 30 minutes because my earlobes ached.  Had they been hollow I would have kept them."
1.0,2 out of 4 had holes in the side seam area.
1.0,Terrible DO NOT BUY<br /><br />looks nothing like photos<br /><br />Can use this dress as a table cloth‚Äî on it looks similar to a red hospital gown / super cheap material
1.0,Window fogs from breath.
1.0,"My wife is average height and healthy weight.  These cut into her thighs and aren't ""thigh high"".  They stretch to be thin and see through above the knee.<br /><br />If you're shorter than 5'5"" and your calves are about the same diameter as your thighs, these could work for you.  If you're average or above - avoid."
1.0,"I loved this purse, got tons of compliments on it.  I have only had it since January 17, and the strap has already broke and the whole inside liner has already torn/come apart however my return time expired on February 12 I am completely disappointed!!"
1.0,It came tarnished. I opened the box and didn't even have to open the plastic to see the gold color ruined by brown brassy splotches. They gave a refund so I'm not upset. But beware of the cuffs or bangles.
1.0,"The material is not rugged, the high waist is the picture is misleading as to what the high waist actually is."
1.0,"fits extremely small, not what was expected. for very small tiny woman."
1.0,Its very tight and very thin
1.0,"I like the look of this watch. However, the first time I put it on, I was walking around my home getting ready to go out, and it fell off my wrist ... the clasp that connects the band to the watch popped out.  (I guess I should have read the reviews that warned that this might happen.) I only had the watch 1/2 an hour before it broke, during gentle use. Don't waste your time and money on this item."
1.0,"The lining inside for use is much smaller than the bag, leaving half of the volume of the bag unuseable."
1.0,The zipper was broken on arrival. The bag will not hold up. Disappointing!!!
1.0,"Poor quality, uncomfortable. Cheaply made."
1.0,The material should be cotton not polyester
1.0,"My pair of pants ripped after one use during my workout. I was so excited to find these pants because I used to wear shorts for warm ups when I danced, so I‚Äôm sad these didn‚Äôt live up to my expectations"
1.0,Cute sweater ordered a med for like a very big large
1.0,Poorly made. Broken zipper on the first wear...would never purchase again. I can't return because the return date was 11/14/2016. My mistake was not trying it on upon arrival. Hard lesson.
1.0,"This smelled so bad of chemicals I hung it up for 3 days in the garage to see if the smell would disappear, nope! Husband came home and asked if I spilled something? Will return! Second item I purchased not knowing it was from China, and both were poor fabric and strong chemical smell. I am returning both!"
1.0,Broke in the first week.  Cool style though.
1.0,The length is huge . Looks that is design fir a 6 ‚Äò woman
1.0,The sizing is not correct.
1.0,"Cheap is the breast way to describe this watch, but it works and wears nicely."
1.0,would not buy again  material  not really linen  heavy and  color is very bland  the pink is more orange than pink very disappointed  good enough around the house but not for work or play.
1.0,"The material is cheap and the stitching on the top is way off. You would expect a high low hem to be long in the back and short in the front, but this top is stitched log in the front and short in the back. I would not purchase again."
1.0,Stones are so small I can barely see them. And I definitely can't see the names of my children
1.0,There are no shoelaces....it is some goofy expandable thing. Shoes fly off your feet and you can't add normal laces
1.0,"I sized up for an over size fit and it ended up being way too small. It‚Äôs extremely short, has no stretch and is overall very tiny even with sizing up. Definitely do not recommend and I‚Äôm not pleased by any aspect."
1.0,Maybe I was confused b/c it said women's. It was more like girls size or jr. Way smaller than I expected. Gave it away. Took so lomg to come in I forgot I ordered it. Quality was ok for thr price...1 star b/c I had to.
1.0,They don‚Äôt even stick to my nose. They just fall off
1.0,"Both side edges (3/8"")are stiff and curved outward.  So this pale pink lace mask does not look good. Amazon.com said ""Made in U.S.A"" but the actual package stated clearly ""Made in China""."
1.0,Least compression of any socks I purchased.  One pair completely unraveled at the heel within a month of receiving.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Was just like a cut piece of clothing
1.0,"Thin cloth, too big, looks uncomfortable"
1.0,Was looking forward to buying the watch until I discovered it has carcinogens in it
1.0,"One of the nose pads broke,  just after a few times  I have used the glasses."
1.0,This product was the worst of anything i have ever purchased thru Amazon.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
1.0,"Will tun your fingers green, do not bother with them<br />If you want"
1.0,Feel apart immediately. One seam wasn't sewn shut at all . Couldn't even use them.
1.0,"Haha this item is SO cheap. Its see-through first of all. Its literally a couple of layers of tight(ish) mesh. The front is way shorter than the back. Its just cut strangely. I purchased a large because I have a bigger bust and im of average to large size of an american woman (size 12 in pants, usually a large in shirts and dresses, 36D in a bra), and the top of this dress -where the straps met the top seam and the v neck part- came about 3 inches in from my armpits on my chest. It looked ridiculous and the v cut was nowhere near my boobs. Sat weirdly up high instead. Just.. dont waste your time trying this on, let alone your money."
1.0,"So this is mixed review.. everything looked great, quality was good but the valves came detached and were very difficult to attach to the mask, I never succeeded so I returned them after several attempts."
1.0,"Holy mannn! I was so excited to use these. I opened it today and tried to use for my workout, but before I got a good workout, the medium red band snapped! I wasn‚Äôt expecting much cause it was cheap but I expected it to last at least a couple of workouts! Not very happy!"
1.0,"Looks cheap,"
1.0,Way too small! Does not fit
1.0,No cubre y puede llegar a respirar el hijo mucho pelusa de el mal material -0 no recomiendo
1.0,"Tail broke already, ears are extremely flimsy."
1.0,The shirt that was sent to me does not look nothing like the one in the picture.. in the back you cannot see a line but the one they sent me there is a line right in the middle of the back. Also material looks cheap and the thread is coming out and its visible
1.0,"This dress was said to be robbed as the black one, yet isn‚Äôt."
1.0,This necklace is so gaudy. It came in broken and looks (and obviously is) cheap! I‚Äôm disappointed.
1.0,not sized correctly
1.0,"This skirt is truly unwearable. I bought a large and while it fit, it was so short that my behind was almost hanging out. I really wanted to love it because it seems to be good quality but there is no way that I could wear it. For reference, I am 5‚Äô1 and wear an 8S in Old Navy."
1.0,This is deceiving and hilarious! This is satin and they are selling it as silk!
1.0,Very pretty but beads started falling off and then it fell off the keychain part and got lost 1st day of using it. Very upset!!!
1.0,"Quality not what I would expect from the picture. It is not as long as it shows, and it's see through."
1.0,"This dress was not as expected at all. It came to mid thigh on me, and was super tight. I'm a big girl, so I ordered a 2X, it was way too small, no room to move in it. It was too short. I did not like this dress at all."
1.0,Way too small and I went by the size chart!
1.0,This was the second try with your socks.  Once you get them on they are wonderful. However trying. To get them off is a nightmare.  I live alone my legs were bruised trying to get them off.  All the other things I have bought were great.  Copper fit clothing was Wonderfull i have had nine back surgeries those thing helped me recover.  I do not want this published. It‚Äôs for your eyes only.
1.0,I was very disappointed with the material very cheaply made.
1.0,the charm is so so small did be a little bigger than what it was not happy
1.0,It's alright.... But I don't think I will actually wear it.
1.0,"Timely delivery after ordering but beware. The quality is quite poor, feels flimsy and just doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll will endure the rest of time. Definitely get what you buy in this case"
1.0,Terrible sizing (much too small) and aweful quality.
1.0,Watch face came out almost immediately. (1 day)  You get what you pay for.
1.0,Unfortunately the fabric developed runs like pantyhose would upon first day of wear
1.0,Only gave 1 star because I had to. Normally wear 3X ordered 5X because I wanted it to be loose and flowing.  It's WAY too small. Tag says 5X but probably more like 2X.
1.0,Inconsistent sizing between styles.
1.0,very low quality fabric
1.0,"Rubbery plastic, and obviously so."
1.0,Fit was weird.  Bottoms way to big compared to top
1.0,"Way too small, not made well."
1.0,"Love the bag. However, the handle broke in less than a month."
1.0,Shocked and disgusted by this ad.  So sad to see such a young girl posing in such a sexually charged manner.  This ad belongs on an FBI watchlist
1.0,Tarnished fast and didn‚Äôt really go with the watch style.
1.0,These were much bigger than all of my other plugs of the same size.
1.0,"I ordered a medium rhinestone bikini. The shipping was fast which was great. However, when I received it there was a SMALL bottom. I‚Äôm very disappointed the wrong size was sent because it is very cute. I will have to return."
1.0,Very nice shoe but didn‚Äôt fit
1.0,doesn't do what it is intended to do.
1.0,It is not the same mask shown in the picture
1.0,They shipped the wrong glasses. These are nothing like the gold and clear lens I was looking for.
1.0,"My septum immediately had a reaction from the metal as soon as I put it in. Total waste of money. It is so harsh with chemicals even after cleaning it this happened. Absolutely misleading description, not worth risking an infection or further allergic reaction."
1.0,Feels like lead.  Gave it away
1.0,I am very careful keeping my jewelry protected and clean but this is made poorly and the gold tarnished very quickly and the gem dulled too‚Äî don‚Äôt buy these studs or any other color they have.
1.0,I bought this shirt for me but I knew if I wore it in publice I would get arrested. so I'm giving it to the old lady in the family
1.0,The cut/angle of the eye holes don‚Äôt seem to be standard to the face. Not a comfortable fit around the eyes. And the item is non-fundable as I assume for health reasons. Overall not worth the money.
1.0,"Definitely not made for taller people.  Based upon description, very disappointing"
1.0,"When I bought these socks, the picture showed 4 pairs. When the order came it only had two pairs. If it shows 4 pairs it should have 4 pairs. Very deceptive advertising. On the return it showed two pairs. I‚Äôm very disappointed and wouldn‚Äôt recommend these socks or this company to anyone! Don‚Äôt be deceived!!"
1.0,"It‚Äôs like they took the most pixelated, worst quality image they could find and did an iron-on application on a cheap, scratchy shirt. I took a chance and wish I hadn‚Äôt. Do not buy from this seller."
1.0,Fits small and very thin material
1.0,washed 1 time it fits my 8 yr old
1.0,It is absolutely hideous it looks like a huge shower curtain
1.0,Disliked. It wasn‚Äôt compatible with my Michael Kors.
1.0,This ring looked to me like one of the 25 cent rings you buy out of a gum ball machine. The ring is extremely light and I firmly do not believe that it is sterling silver. I hope amazon takes this product off their website. I can not imagine one person on earth spending almost $200 on this ring and actually being happy with it.
1.0,I would return these but I bought them for vacation and I was out of town when the return window expired. Unwearable because the pads fall off constantly
1.0,Crap.<br />You deserve more. Keep swiping.
1.0,Broke with in a couple days üòï
1.0,"I was sad when i saw the kate spade brand name as if it was just written compared to the original Kate spade it's no way the same. Though the quality is kinda okay but still the kate spade name and logo should be embossed. So, this is not original."
1.0,"I was careless enough not to read the reviews on this product, so now I am writing one more similar one.<br /><br />When you open the package, you don't find any certificate anywhere, either in the packing, or engraved in the glasses. They don't even have the brand engraved on them. When  I have purchased safety glasses before, they always come with some indication of the standards they meet, in the glasses themselves. I decided not to risk it, and lose the $15 rather than my eyesight. I'll be buying proper, certified glasses, say, from Uvex, and so should you."
1.0,It had line that went down the legs and looked like a stain
1.0,Purse looks prettier on the picture then in person. The gold buckle was already chipping when I received the purse.
1.0,The pattern is great but this is a really tiny and ill fitting hat
1.0,I ordered the 3X bc it says US size 12-14. OMG. There's no way!! Its SO big on me it's laughable. I definitely need a smaller size.
1.0,"CHEAP...CHEAP...CHEAP!!!  I wish these Chinese knockoff companies would would 1) make clothes that actually fit, and 2) use actual pictures of the product THEY make and not what they are copying.  The dress was cute enough that I would've worn it, but it was too small!"
1.0,The button fell out of one of the straps and now I lost it and the spring. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS.
1.0,"When I put this dress on, my husband said ‚Äú It kind of looks like a polyester pillowcase with a ruffle on it.‚Äù<br />He is not wrong, as indeed it did.‚òπÔ∏è<br />It‚Äôs a very cheaply made dress,even the material is cheap and like...sweaty?<br />I got hot putting it on, so the material definitely doesn‚Äôt breathe.<br />Regarding the cheaply made comment,the print is not on the back of the ruffle or tie parts so that you can see the weird stretchy white side of the sash when you tie the bow for the faux wrap.<br />It‚Äôs also rather large in the chest area, but drastically less in the waist so it looks ... bizarre.<br />It‚Äôs like someone made a mini dress for Jessica Rabbit or something.<br />It‚Äôs not even that the dress is too big, which it is, its that it‚Äôs sewn with weird body dimensions so even if it was my size, it still wouldn‚Äôt fit right.<br />I‚Äôve mentioned the cons so I should probably mention the pros.<br />The pro‚Äôs of this dress are... well, it‚Äôs stretchy. Also, if you have a very large chest, this probably would fit you, it might be a bit tight in the waist area, but it‚Äôll definitely fit the girls.<br />Um... the back zipper is a nice feature?<br />Listen, they tried. If the dress were $12-15 dollars, I‚Äôd say give it a shot,  because maybe I just got a faulty one or something but at the price it is now, it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.<br />For your reference, I am 5ft, 103lbs, 24 waist,30 B/C chest. The dress was 3 inches above my knee, about 4 inches bigger in my waist and the bust would have fit a 36-38 chest.<br />I purchased a small. I figured it would be a little bit too big based on the measurements provided in the listing and I could simply sew it smaller, but it‚Äôs already sewn so weirdly that I‚Äôd probably have to take the whole thing apart, recut it, then sew it back together!<br />Not worth it.<br />I returned the dress and paid the $6 to have it picked up and sent back to whence it came.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1.0,i ordered this necklace and they sent me a ukiss necklace and almost waited 2 months for the necklace to get home to find out it was what i didn't order then i tried to email them to see if i can get my money back or get what i wanted but they said they were in vacation and never answered me again
1.0,"Was broke when arrived in the mail, cute frames but not durable"
1.0,Junk it falls apart when washed
1.0,I am a med and so I ordered an extra large and it still didn't fit!! so mad
1.0,They will not stay together
1.0,"I am a size D/DD, and these definitely do not work for me. They are too small in circumference, and make weird lines. Did not feel like there was enough support to go out in public. Also...have fun peeling very sticky material from very sensitive skin. I do not recommend these lifts."
1.0,Hair came out everywhere! Very cheaply made
1.0,Poor quality and cheaply made
1.0,Worthless -  the snaps are so tight you cannot snap or unsnap them.<br />It is a very nice looking duster but I would like one I could wear.
1.0,"It fit, but the zipper made the waistline stick out"
1.0,I was going to use this for my daughters first birthday party. However it looks like this was previously worn and another baby spit up on it.
1.0,"It says ‚Äú12‚Äù fangs, but the package arrived with one set of fangs inside."
1.0,"It runs small, but it looks amazing"
1.0,El producto nunca lleg√≥
1.0,"This neck strap is too short to be useful to me.  I'm average height (U.S. adult male) and this strap is too short to use with my alto.  In my opinion, it would be useful for a child playing alto, no one on tenor.  I will not be able to use this."
1.0,Lasted just over a month before getting a hole at the toe.  Just had to toss them out
1.0,had to give away
1.0,"The sling lasted only for 5 days, poor quality."
1.0,"The watch is clunky, set button is huge, seems to lose time and the companies customer service is horrible."
1.0,It started falling after washing
1.0,WAY too much material at bottom. Looked like a tent. Had to return it.
1.0,They ripped after the first wash on the waist area. Fit a bit smaller then my other larger underwear.
1.0,Material shiny thin and see through. I returned this and a few other ones.
1.0,I can only get small toe in
1.0,It was supposed to be one size fits most.  I have rather small arms and they were way too tight and too short for me.
1.0,the neck opening was to large
1.0,It said plus size but it was way to small
1.0,This is the worst sports bra I have ever worn!! Wish I would have returned it a long time ago but now just throwing it in the garbage. This bra is SO UNCOMFORTABLE. The straps are made of this bizarre heavy plastic-like fabric and sealed on the side which makes it extremely itchy. Do not buy.
1.0,"Size too small, gave it to my granddaughter!"
1.0,Runs small & it torn open on the arms seems
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:639821916a6078c8c87b5dd3d274f96]] Really fell in love with the design so i decided to order. But once I received the necklace, the ‚Äústone‚Äù was completely see-through. Nothing like the picture. Sadly, I will be returning this."
1.0,It does NOT fit like a dress at all. Fits more like a long shirt. Very disappointed.
1.0,Just wasn‚Äôt pleased with the material at all.
1.0,"For the price, this dress was looking really good. But, after reading other's reviews, I was concerned about the skirt riding up and making the skirt overlay look awkward. Also, there were no fabric care instructions, which just really irritated me. Especially after trying it on and my hands turning black from the dye. ugh."
1.0,it fits for me! but cheap quality! in photo flowers design is silver but i received in gold colour! looks very cheap@
1.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet...when it arrives.  I wore it for a couple of months and by the end of that time it was no longer silver, but a hideous coppery color.  The prayer is engraved deeply, but it doesn't help if the bracelet is too ugly to wear."
1.0,My daughter can wear a size 3 and i bought a size 140 and it was super small very disappointed
1.0,eh. Too big. Too heavy and chunky for teens.
1.0,It won't let me return this thing its weird and awkward its got like little wings on the end or curved out all weird.
1.0,The shorts were MUCH smaller than in the picture and I'm a fairly slim person. Returned it.
1.0,"The dress is so pretty, but if  you are anything over a b or c cup, I wish you luck. I'm a size 10 American. 5'8"" 155, 36C and I got the XXL and it fits everywhere. I washed it twice and now it fits shoulders, waist, and length, but does not fit my boobs at all."
1.0,I laughed when I took it out of package. It's huge! Looks nothing like picture. Please don't waste your money. Returning
1.0,"Small than size, cheaply made. ZIP came off after first try on."
1.0,This necklace arrived much smaller than shown. It appears to be poorly made and its not attractive at all. Looks like a dollar store item. Very poor quality. Definitely a horrible buy
1.0,"Product arrived late. Dress looks nice on, BUT...the material is very scratchy, no padding in the bra area, sequin falls off with slight touch, underskirt barely covered the bottom of my butt."
1.0,"Way too small. I ordered the XL and it is only 28‚Äù in the waist and hips with very little stretch. It says it‚Äôs for juniors but it‚Äôs more like for children. It also smells weird, like some sort of chemical. They did offer to take it back but I would have to pay the shipping to China. I‚Äôll stick it in a donation bin instead."
1.0,Well honestly I don't like that thev14kt gold was mix with resin
1.0,"I have some great, does not help me to improve my posture"
1.0,"Within the first 15 min of wearing them the buttons fell off. Cute, but cheaply made"
1.0,Bought what I thought would work as advertised and it did not fit. I sent it back. It does not look at all as what it does in the picture either.
1.0,This shoe was exactly what my grandson wanted. But within about three weeks the velcro came off the straps (both shoes) and the shoes began to stretch out across the toe area. Not very satisfied with the quality of the shoe.
1.0,Not as pictured. I‚Äôd love an ALL purple mask. Not this white strip. They get fuzzy fast. Smells of dye when you first put them on but I fanned them out and it‚Äôs not as pungent if only taken on the pack.
1.0,Cheaply made. Not sure if this is really a Barstool Sports shirt. Would not buy.
1.0,Seconds not working.. And I bought it with gift üåØwrap  .. When I recieve it it was no gift wrap and broken box
1.0,What a cruel April fools joke&#34;...did this happen to anyone else who bought this watch?..really disappointing...I don't even own a guitar and watch is sold out...
1.0,chain went black in a couple of days.
1.0,"The ring cuts into your tongue, I think the gem is too heavy for it to be on your tongue."
1.0,"Not only was this hoodie too large, after one washing the zipper fell off."
1.0,they didn't even stay in. but they cute for a picture.
1.0,Piece of CRAP!!! Material is so skimpy better off going naked.
1.0,The post broke first time I tried to wear them. Very disappointed as they are super cute.
1.0,The pockets are very oddly placed. Makes your butt look square.
1.0,"This item was very hard to put in. If you bend it too far, it's  very hard to bend it back. I'm  a very unsatisfied customer."
1.0,It gives you a very uneasy feeling specially right now.
1.0,I bought these for me adult son and for myself. Very disappointed. Even being wide calf size they go on so hard and just do not work for him. I have all of them now and I feel the same way. I have had to wear compression socks for years and these are terrible! They are my last resort if all others are in the laundry.
1.0,The shirt is not same material as in photo or description.
1.0,Wouldn't fit a newborn!
1.0,Tan horrible que mejor me toc√≥ que tirarlos a la basura por que no es lo que mostraba la imagen mostraba algo peque√±o no esto tan grande tan feo  üò£
1.0,Was a lil tight to be a 3x must be the way the material made but it was a very beautiful shirt.
1.0,Tore after 20 minutes
1.0,"If I could give zero stars I would!  It's not even a swimsuit.  It's more like a cheaply made bodysuit!  There is no lining, it is completely see through and the straps are nothing more than cheap bra straps with plastic clasps.  It feels like cheap costume material.  DO NOT ORDER!!"
1.0,"Way too small! I don't think these things could fit on a small child. Then wash and hang dry and they get even smaller... Put them around a mason jar while wet and it feels like I'm waiting for the watermelon rubber band trick... Won't buy these again.<br />Side note, I'm a 6ft woman not plus sized and the xl is a joke. Reminds me of when I was a child and I'd save the creamer containers for Barbie trash cans for a size comparison."
1.0,These fit terrible the ends of the fingers are stitched so badly. I cut the fingers to see if maybe I can use them as fingerless. Didn‚Äôt work at all. Straight to the trash. Save your money.
1.0,Wore it once and where the rivets are in the belt are already tearing in several places. Even once that i have not used.
1.0,Washed once and following instructions and wonder woman logo lifting not happy
1.0,I bought this band in May and already some spots  around the main frame the color<br />is removed and underneath color is exposed. Very disappointed.
1.0,Not what I was expecting.. it's super stiff and hard to look natural. It's a beautiful print though
1.0,"This is stupid. It‚Äôs right and uncomfortable. It either falls off my nose or blocks my eyes, seems to be no in between."
1.0,Very flimsy.  First pair ripped out on back.  Fits small.
1.0,"Cute shirt. But, its way to tight on the bottom.  The fabric is not what the description says. Im 5""9 and 124 pounds. I do not like this top."
1.0,The mask/with clear view shield 'arrived' in a timely matter however I NEED a replacement as you can see in photo above it arrived almost used in my opinion its<br />smudged & scratched. Very disappointed
1.0,Broke before I could wear it
1.0,"I opened my pack of beautiful snake earrings 3 days after delivery and find one of the little hoops broken. I wanted to wear them today, but... I'm disappointed."
1.0,"Horrible. Top rolls down, bottom rolls up. The pads are the size of round jar lid - looks ridiculous and does show through everything. Arrived with holes in the side fabric and seam threads loose and unraveling."
1.0,It was way loose for a small. Overall it was very cheap made and cheap looking.
1.0,"I was so excited for this until I tried it on. It‚Äôs too tight and the built in bra is a remake of Madonnas pointed bras in the 80‚Äôs-90‚Äôs. However, the material is soft. I wasted my money on this."
1.0,I ordered two of these because after I ordered one I found another one for like 1/3 of the cost. Ended up returning both of them because one of them came with no hole for the wrap dress. ( like they don‚Äôt know how a wrap dress works .  You would literally have to make a hole in your dress yourself  to be able to wrap it and wear it like it‚Äôs supposed to be worn .)  And the other one was just poorly made the top part of it was too big and some places in to small and others.
1.0,Broke within days.
1.0,Material cheaply made.  I tried returning and seller only wants to give me 70% of my money back and I have to pay for return!!  Not happy at all
1.0,Disappointed with the entire fit altogether. I‚Äôm 114 lbs and the small fit like a large. Not just the torso area but the sleeves were unnecessarily large and wide as well. My bf could probably fit into this ‚Äúsmall‚Äù
1.0,There is no spoon. I got the outer package still sealed but no spoon.
1.0,Thos does not look as its advertised.  Way to low cut...looks bad with a tank under also.  Extremely disappointing
1.0,These earrings were way too small. Could only fit a baby.
1.0,"I love this, it makes me feel so ethereal. Nice fabric, fits perfectly, would definitely buy again!!!<br />**edit: after wearing 2 times for an hour each the elastic or whatever fell out and now it‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs grip. Literally unwearable- it falls down the shoulders and has nothing to support it!! Do NOT buy! Waste of cash."
1.0,The vinyl print was bubbled and lifting from the shirt and we ordered a size up and got an XL for my daughter who wears a MD loosely and it was tight on her. Sizing is incredibly wrong! Very disappointed with this purchase!
1.0,"NO COMPRAR, un enga√±o, estafa, Pobre calidad, tama√±o extremadamente peque√±o, parece de juguete."
1.0,"I returned this, it was short and very wide, didn't look like the picture"
1.0,NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The picture is a beautiful light brown color. What I received is a red/orange brown. Certainly not what I was expecting and not what I wanted.
1.0,"I don't like the material at all and the design arrived very faded, not bright or vibrant at all.  I do not recommend this t-shirt."
1.0,the pendant was so tiny; hard to make out the design
1.0,I got a price of material it had not been sewed at all
1.0,"They have obviously changed who they get to actually manufacture the shirts . They run way too small in the arms, even the XL.  I have bought several white shirts that fit fine, and the black color fits great.  For some reason, the blue shirt is way off in size.  FIX THIS!!!!!"
1.0,Very disappointed. The top was to big and the bottom was to small. I missed my return window.
1.0,the wrist band broke the same day i got it other than that it looks good but just cheap.
1.0,Ordered a medium and received an XL. Love the shirt but would‚Äôve loved it more if it was the correct size.
1.0,Chain snapped in less than two months. Feel cheated.
1.0,"The model in the photo is clearly a size 0 petite, short female.  I ordered a small which is what I normally wear. The shoulders fit fine but the lower part is snug. Now I'm not skinny but the photo makes it seem as if the top flares out into a nice flowy fit. It does not. It is also much shorter than the photo. The length of this top does not cover my pelvis and nowhere close to covers my butt. It's a very short top. I'm 5'5&#34;."
1.0,"This is the fourth time i wear this t-shirt, inside the house, never washed. Today i noticed the print is coming out. Such a really bad quality print. Never happened this to me with any other t-shirt. I will not recommend to anybody to buy this one. I have the pictures but for some reasons i don't know i can't post them."
1.0,Run too  large
1.0,I hated giving it one star. Picture is very misleading. Could kick myself for forgetting to read the reviews. I was under such pressure for something for Christmas for my brilliant college age nephew and he loves Dr. Who. This looked like metal. Sending it back. DON'T waste your money unless you're buying for a six year old. :(
1.0,They do not close properly at all. After struggling to try and fit the hinge in the tiny home my ears became irritated and sore. They are weak material and been the wrong way.
1.0,Worst product I have ever purchased on amazon
1.0,Broke the band within one week of wearing it. Glad I saved my iPhone band. Stock band apparently is much stronger
1.0,Really big for me! I could'nt use it!
1.0,"Just over a year after ordering these glasses, the bridge on two of the three pair have split in half. Had to throw them away."
1.0,This looks a lot better then it is. We got it for party and head would not blow up. Totally dissipated.
1.0,"I'm sorry, but this dress looked like a cheap polyester dress to me. I returned it immediately."
1.0,This was one of the cheapest materials. I ended up returning this. It is see through and cheap made.
1.0,I review two sides of each earring without the front piece.
1.0,The dollar store version of a vest. Horrible.
1.0,"Worst candle ever...didn't even offer another one to try, just refunded me:) very disappointed!!"
1.0,Did not fit me well.  I am 5'0&#34; and the waistband was way too low.  Sent it back.
1.0,The measurement chart is way off!!! It's way way way too small!
1.0,please be aware that returns are at the customer's expense even when the product is defective.  the one i received was defective and i wanted a refund.  they said return it for a replacement.  wrong answer.  be sure you want whatever they send. i think its a very bad return policy.  good luck.
1.0,"Very disappointed! Inaccurate description! I bought this because the description stated 14k Italian Gold. My daughter has allergies to custom jewelry, therefore I always purchase gold jewelry. This necklace arrived and she loved it, put it on her neck right away she was so excited. I guaranteed her it was real... Next morning she woke itchy & scratching her neck. I got so worried and took this picture.  Needless to say it's going back. It is a lovely necklace. But please don't mislead customers. In our case it can lead to medical emergency."
1.0,Would not buy again. My little one didn't even like or want it. Would not recommend
1.0,Very large and heavy not what I expected
1.0,Broke when came
1.0,doesn't fit at all
1.0,I Returned this product. The color of the actual item looks nothing like what was being shown.
1.0,Pretty but really poor quality.  I've had it 2 weeks and it's already broken.
1.0,Would not recommend it to anyone. The box itself started to separate on every corner. Girlfriend had it for not even a month.
1.0,The sticky heel didnt survive a single wash. Ive had other liners for like 2 years and they still stick.
1.0,I don't use them. I thought they would fit in my ear and they're too thick and gauges. Cute idea but I have to buy a pair that isn't thick so it fits in my ear bc I love the design
1.0,"this of course just tickles by little goth girl heart. fits awesome on my thumb and is sturdy.<br /><br />UPDATE: This is a far more brittle ring than it looks. It just sorta...split in half when I went to go put it on. I know it's not super fancy but I always take care of my rings (don't get wet, remove for any cleaning/sleeping) so I am a bit sad it broke so quickly."
1.0,broke first time I wore it.
1.0,"It is not finished inside, it is very rough and tore my scarf. The opening to pull the scarf through is also<br />very small, only OK for small thin scarfs. I was very disappointed and not able to use it. My scarfs are not<br />thin."
1.0,Said it was a helmet and it was a mask
1.0,Don liked
1.0,"I purchased a few of these and after a couple of washings, the boning came through all of them.  Terrible purchase.  Dont waste your money!"
1.0,Garbage it's look nice in the pictures but it turns color after 2 days . Wasting
1.0,"The face lace is not designed the same way it appears on the photo above.  Very disappointing.  And the Lace is already detaching from the wire on the ears.<br />Some of the photos that people have posted. Above have the correct lace of the face and others dont, like I have, with the long strings in face. This is not what I wanted. I wanted the fave lace to be like the picture above.  And they sent me something with a different design Of lace face. Disappointed"
1.0,This seller is wrong for selling a size small this big. Ridiculously big.
1.0,The glasses are cheaply made and came broken and bent. When printing out the return label I decided that since these were $18.00 glasses I wasn‚Äôt going to pay for postage to return them.
1.0,"Liked the robe when I received it.  However, after the first  washing two of the seams came apart.<br />The seams cannot be resown.  Very disappointing!"
1.0,"Very unhappy. The fabric was extremely poor quality. Also, I ordered a small and the size I got looked like an extra large or bigger. Not even close to wearable"
1.0,Material was a huge disappointment.  Would not be caught dead in it.
1.0,"At least 2 sizes to small, flimsy and poor quality.  Soooo disappointedüò∂"
1.0,"My mom got me these earrings for Christmas and the second i take them out of the box I notice they aren't what the photo makes them look like. The back of the planet is flat and isn't fully round and while I was HOLDING them not even putting them on yet, the planet fell out of the earring. They weren't even glued on. I thought "" oh I can just have me and my mom put them back and stuff. But then, when I go to put them on, I accidentally drop the back of the earring and because its so extremely small I can't find it. This is a nightmare product and please be warned not to buy this and to put your money towards something good and to only buy this for someone you hate as a passive aggressive gift."
1.0,The snap connection bent 2ND time i used them and so does not stay connected
1.0,Returned it. Not flattering.
1.0,Two seperate pieces. The ring came apart
1.0,"Bought 2 bracelets. The first one, the chain broke within 30 mins of wearing it. The second one, the gold is wearing off within the first week. How do I contact seller for a refund??"
1.0,Thin like a piece of a paper. The leather smells like it's been dipped into a tub with chemicals.
1.0,"When I put them on, they were comfodable, but too big in the lower tummy area. When I sat down they bunched up...other than that fun pants!"
1.0,Very cheap material! Not as I expected it to be.
1.0,The fact that this item will not measure the average seller will not accept the return of fictional measurements
1.0,not recommendable.
1.0,"Packaging was correct, inside was the wrong keychain. On top of that, it was misspelled: ‚ÄúPhlehotomist by day, vampire by night‚Äù. I think they meant ‚Äòphlebotomist‚Äô, so that‚Äôs funny at least."
1.0,"The color of the jacket is not the same as in the picture, and the smell of the jacket is terrible.  The jacket fits perfectly, and although the color isn't a pictured, it would still be cute if you don't mind smelling like crap."
1.0,Not true to siZe. Runs smaller.
1.0,Paper sack!! No thanks!
1.0,"The print is poorly placed, not like the picture, the circles were over my boobs making it look funny. It also just hangs on my body type like a potato sack. It looked awful. I can see this looking really good on someone very thin but with me it looked really bad (and I'm not that big of a person weight wise, though I am 5' 9"" with hips). This just literally has no shape to it."
1.0,I received the product and they were rusted and used looking. I was so disappointed since it was a gift I sent to my granddaughter.
1.0,I‚Äôve tried three different versions of this bracelet and they all either get frayed overtime and snap or just burst at random. Not worth the money.
1.0,Cheap stitching and done badly
1.0,Too small and I ordered a size up
1.0,"Pretty but, 2 sizes too small.  Will be returning."
1.0,"I will be returning this item, not same as picture fit is way off very small."
1.0,It came off the chain and I lost it.  I submitted a claim but can't get refunded until and if I find it.
1.0,cloth wash them once then they are useless
1.0,Not good quality jewlery. Nice design but wished it looked better. Pieces were moved and fallen off.
1.0,The shorts were shaped extremely weird with bad material. The shirt was cute but disproportionate.
1.0,"Just recently purchased these and loved them at first because they are comfortable... until, after wearing 4-5 times and they started pilling badly! The material on these are so so cheap. Will have to throw away as they already look worn and it hasn‚Äôt even been a month since I purchased them! Total waste of money. I do not recommend."
1.0,"I just received my bag today and though I love the concept of it, I'm disappointed that the metal clip on the strap is broken.  Even when I pop the hook back into the tab, it won't stay.  I'll have to send it back for a replacement.  Bummer!"
1.0,"I was a little upset when I opened the package and it did not include the colors it shows in the picture. It only included black, red, clear and pink.  The biggest reason why I bought these was because there was so many different colors not just the four."
1.0,I have almost paid for this hat twice because I have had to send it back 2 times.  Before I ordered it I looked at the sizes and measured my head to pick the right size.  It was not only wrong the first time but the next size down was too large.<br /><br />So far I am VERY DISSAPPOINTED!  I have wasted money on this and am not likely to buy hats or clothing again from Amazon.
1.0,"This rubber is hard and low quality.  Its stiffness makes it impossible to get a good glue-up on your shoe, because you have to hold 100% of the surface in contact with the sole while the glue dries, it will pull away even with good contact cement.  Vibram rubber is way more flexible and easier to install, in my opinion it's worth the few extra bucks to buy Goodyear or Vibram half soles."
1.0,"I bought this belt a month and a half ago, and it is already falling apart. I didn't know what I expected, but I thought that it could at least function as a belt some amount of time.<br /><br />I will keep looking for a good vegan belt, but this is not the one."
1.0,Not yellow more like burnt orange
1.0,hard to pull it up and keep sliding down after few minutes of walking
1.0,"I bought this wallet and loved it. I used it for about 3 weeks, then I noticed my cell battery was draining really fast. I would charge it in the morning and a few hours later my cell was dead. I could not figure out why this was happening. then it dawned on me that it had to be my new wallet. So I fully charged my cell and put the wallet on the counter by my cell, and sure enough it drained it with in a few hours completely dead. Now I have a wallet this is completely useless. and when I realized what had happened it was to late to return it. Past the 30 days. I will never buy this kind of wallet again. I emailed the company and amazon and neither of them have gotten back to me and that was 9 days ago."
1.0,Terrible! Does not fit well around the arms or legs.
1.0,"don't waste your money on this, doesn't control the tummy. It actually made my stomach look bigger than it actually is. Couldn't return, no payment slip in package."
1.0,"Sadly, this dress is just awful. I ordered this to wear on or family vacation, and unfortunately for me I didn't open it prior to the return window closing. It is just awful though. It looks like you are wearing a giant potato sack."
1.0,This product seemed great for the first week or 2. The first time I bought this band the connector fell apart within the first week. I thought it was just an unfortunate accident and decided to give the band another shot. So I ordered it for a second time. I have worn the watch with the new band for maybe a total of 9 days since the second band came in and the exact same problem happened and the connector fell apart. I am not rough on my watch and haven't done any activities in it that could have possibly caused this to happen.
1.0,"Small, ugly horse mark, strings from buttons sticking out(all of them!!!!).<br />This is completely a waste of money.<br />I will give one star for the bottom pants are ok."
1.0,"I love the look of the band but I am glad I was home when the pin fell out of one side and since it wraps around the iWatch was safe and I could put on another band! I have heard of things happening from another person that is a firm believer of only getting Apple watch bands. I am disappointed, I purchased it on Jan. 19th, 2019. The window for returning closed on Feb. 22nd. I have used it 5 times! I bought 7 other bands so I switch out.  Just disappointed."
1.0,Bought 3.  All 3 arrived with the flower head snapped off the stem.  You cannot ship fragile jewelry wrapped in bubble wrap inside an envelope and expect it to arrive intact.  A pity.  The pins are pretty..
1.0,Can't use so not worth the money
1.0,Very large. Not suitable for small waist. Doesn‚Äôt hold elasticity.
1.0,My daughter loved the belts but one broke the first day she wore it. Disappointed
1.0,"Husband got a grey pair and absolutely loves them! They are a nice material and holds everything in place. Reason for the one star is because he ended up buying a black pair a few weeks later because he loved his grey ones so much. When he recieved the second pair, the material was so thin you could see through them! When he would place anything in them, they would sag so far down he would have to attempt to pin them up and it didn't work. When he walks the objects swing around in his pants. We had ordered the same soze too...They're absolutely terrible. Biggest waste of money. Sad they can't keep their products consistent!"
1.0,"Gave this to my son. Gorgeous tie and he loved it. Today he wore it for the first time and it fell apart after 3 hours. It is actually a great quality tie, but was not sewn together on the back side. Odd thing is, there are some holes like it was stitched but no thread was used. No thread anywhere."
1.0,They just don‚Äôt look at all like the photo. Still kept them to not go through the hassle with the return. Just totally whitewashed pieces that look unfinished.
1.0,WARNING: Do not purchase anything from this company or Modlily. This is not like Zulily. This is a cheap Chinese manufacturer whose clothes are at least 3 sizes too small and made of very cheap material. Nothing is like they advertise. And once you get your order (which takes forever) you can't return it. They don't return emails and make you pay for shipment back to China. I learned my lesson the hard way. BUYER BEWARE unless you just want to throw away your money.
1.0,Make the cash card work!
1.0,The soft ones are really nice and comfortable but the other set was incomplete I only received one so I can‚Äôt wear them unfortunately
1.0,Arrived broken and would have been certainly too big to even wrap around my ear. Disappointed. Sometimes you get what you pay for.
1.0,"Don‚Äôt buy !! I returned it , very thin and you can see straight through it and the fabric is very clingy ."
1.0,Very very very cheap material
1.0,I have nothing to say I returned it NOT WORTH WHAT IT PRICED CHEAO
1.0,"Very cheap quality. Can get the same on eBay, from China, for about $3."
1.0,One of the bows snapped right behind the hinge after using them for 2 days. Very disappointing. It is outside the return window.
1.0,Wish I returned this piece of **** don't get unless you want to waste money.
1.0,The front design (vertical needle) is pretty u comfortable no matter how loose or tight it was set to. My little one could not wear it but for a second.
1.0,I AM LARGE BUT AND I BOUGHT LARGE BUT I WILL SAY IT IS AN SMALL MEDIUM
1.0,It was for my wife... wrong color and irregular size..i got a whole size up..the top was definitely too small but could  fit the pants
1.0,This romper was too small but there are no tags on it to check the size. It also came with a pen mark on it. It seems unfair to have to go through the trouble of returning a defective product.
1.0,"The entire backpack was horrible, the straps wouldn't fasten properly so when I put it on they would loosen up, made hiking horrible. Alot of the zippers where messed up was able to fix some but others where completely useless. Overall the worse backpack I have ever owned. Unlike other packs I have had this one doesn't adjust to different people's heights. Wouldn't recommend this backpack to anyone."
1.0,I ordered my regular size after reviewing the size specifics but this blouse is way too small. It doesn't even have the size written on so that I can confirm whether they sent the actual size that ordered. I'm disappointed!
1.0,The neckline is really low and the material looks super cheap
1.0,Turned my sons nose green within 2 hours.  Total garbage.  DO NOT BUY.
1.0,Arrived with a bent post. Tried to straighten and it just broke off.<br /><br />Luckily I ordered 2 pair- however they were completely different sizes.
1.0,"Item took a long time to arrive, once it arrived the quality was horrible.<br />The buttons aren‚Äôt even aligned and the button line is not even straight."
1.0,Absolutely nothing like it describes except for the color and design. The material is cheap polyester crap and the hands or completely gaping open around the neckline. Absolutely do not order this!
1.0,Too small and I ordered a size up!
1.0,It's really but product I never buy anything about dress
1.0,I bought a second pair thinking that maybe I just had bad luck with the first pair breaking after 1 week of use.  I was wrong. The second pair cracked in the same location above the lens.  Cheap product.  Would not recommend this brand to anyone.
1.0,The beanie hat was too small and snug for my head.
1.0,The material is stuff and scratchy and it looks cheap. I was ‚Äúinfluenced‚Äù to buy it and patiently waited 8 weeks to receive it. Definitely not worth the wait (or the money).
1.0,Arm holes way to small
1.0,The edges r so sharp u could use as a weapon and the change was broken. Another one for the garbage.
1.0,I gave it away. Poorly made.
1.0,It fits like a night gown more than a dress
1.0,This is a nice little watch that comes with a big fakey plastic band that makes little sense.  I've waited since it was announce at CES and I can't believe how disappointing they were.  All the photos look spectacular and I'm a Diesel fan but embarrassingly cheap plastic watch.  Move on.
1.0,Was ok FOR 5 MONTHS BUT now  the watch SMALL PIN FOR THE SECONDS COME OFF
1.0,See through fabric
1.0,Only 2of them is ok other one garbage
1.0,"Sent it back, way too small.  Poor quality"
1.0,"The shoes are made with a sparkly material, not good for boys as advertised."
1.0,"I was unhappy!! Color of pink not so true, but the deal breaker is that the purse strap was more Orange. Returning product!"
1.0,CHANGED COLORS.
1.0,"Nice when they first arrived; but not so nice after eight weeks of use.  One arm became so loose at the hinge that the glasses no longer sit horizontally - the left side sits about one inch below the right side.  I have Dollar Store readers that are over 16 months old and are still fine.  However, bifocals would be more convenient, but not these.  I cannot recommend using these glasses."
1.0,The quality of these boots are terrible. My son has only been wearing them off and on for a little over a month and look at them. He only wears them to school... And now the stitching is coming undone and the laces are coming apart!
1.0,Horrible!!! I ordered the large since they said to order up. It was like a sack and the straps were so tight you couldn't even attempt to get it on. If you have a long torso it def won't fit
1.0,"The pads bunch up so I took those out. I can wear it with the pads out, but it is still very small."
1.0,We were disappointed at the appearance of the shoes & they will not stay on our 1 year old nephew we got them as a gift & were embarrased to give them to them üòè
1.0,Ordered a medium and they were way too small. Size up several sizes.
1.0,lasted two months before clasp broke off and was lost.
1.0,"Bought these, loved them, then the seam ripped a little after a month. Returned those, bought another pair to give benefit of doubt, they ripped worse in little over a month (and they refused a refund this time). Horrible quality, considering I usually wear a smaller size than I purchased. Don't buy these unless you are rail thin, as they don't care if their product fails you after a mere thirty days. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"I bought this top in the wine color for vacation & it arrived the day I was flying out. After a day at the beach, I started noticing pink hues on my body, clothes, beach bag. I finally realized it was this swim top color bleeding onto everything! I washed it twice in the sink and even after showering it stained the white hotel sheets just from residual on my body. I dried it in the dryer & it stained the white dryer basin pink at our hotel!!! I scrubbed & couldn't get it off. Everywhere it‚Äôs left to drip dry it‚Äôs stained those areas. I‚Äôm so not happy! Buyer beware!<br />Besides the color transfer nightmare, the top is not breathable fabric & super hot. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get it off. The only only plus is that it makes the twins look good."
1.0,Purchased this to wear after a double mastectomy as I needed a fully buttoned down nightgown. Received it the day before surgery. Home from the hospital today and out it on for bed-IT IS MY ONLY BUTTON DOWN OPTION-and it is missing a button at the top of my stomach area near the mastectomy. Now I am laid up for 4 weeks with nothing to wear unless I want my caregivers to see everything. This is 100% junk and I am so sorry that I chose it to wear post surgery.
1.0,It falls off and isn't great quality at all.
1.0,Description said 20 % spandex however there is so stretch or spandex to to denim.  Waited a long time to get these and I‚Äôm so disappointed!
1.0,"Broke after second time wearing them. So disappointed because they are cute, but not fun having to walk into a store without a shoe to buy another pair of sandals because these broke while I was out the house."
1.0,"Cute, but small inside to hold items..  Wish I had returned.."
1.0,Ordered wrong size :( but it looked pretty
1.0,The fit was too large. Cant use it as formal wear. Material is decent
1.0,Useless. Does not lock into the M frame.
1.0,"Always slips! I was hoping it would sit still on my head, but it doesn‚Äôt even last one minute."
1.0,Love the style ... way too small. The size options shown is that for children.
1.0,It's super short which I was already expecting but the reason why I sent it back was the static was SOO bad it was suctioned to my body plus you could hear and feel the electric static every time you moved.
1.0,Runs small order up
1.0,Terrible quality it looks cheap
1.0,"Poor Quality.  I waited a month for it and when I got it I could not believe what I saw.  The worst was that when I tried it on the side seam came unraveled.  At first I thought it might be a side seam notch but as a pulled the sweater on it started growing.  In addition,  It has lots of flaps of sweater around the neckline that look thin, cheap and out of place.  The sleeves are not lined and are tight.  The pocket lining fabric is too big for the pocket area the extra fabric shows as a bump when the sweater is zipped.  The hood is styled poorly so looks like it's made for a cone head.  It's pointy.  I would never wear this.  The awkward fabric around the neck it hidden in the picture by hair and cropping."
1.0,"This was a gift for my 5 year old nephew, and it was a bust! Nothing opens, no buttons to push, nothing much to speak of, unfortunately!"
1.0,Elastic was way way way too tight.  Returned
1.0,"I bought this product for a Halloween, it states it comes with 2 hats, 2 eye patches, and a set of earrings which was perfect. The ONLY thing that came were the two hats. and they are extremely flimsy hats. Extremely disappointed that I didn‚Äôt get my full order."
1.0,Can‚Äôt breathe through it!
1.0,"My mom purchased a 3-pack of X-Small, as I needed compression shirts for medical reasons. I received Small. Cute, love the material and cut, but doesn't serve my purpose.  So after letting the seller know about the mixup, we bought another 3-pack of X-Small.  AGAIN, I received Small instead.  I kept all 6 as tanktops, I didn't want to bother my mom just because the seller is unresponsive. They're ok and I needed new tanktops, but just so you know, X-Small doesn't exist!5"
1.0,"Ordered a small and it was HUGE! I tie it in a knot in the back and wear it to work out now, but that was not the intended purpose when i bought it."
1.0,riped immediately
1.0,I liked the t-shirt but hated the time that it took to get it.  they changed the delivery date  three different times.  I wouldn't buy from this company again.
1.0,"Cute dress -- in the picture.  But in real life?  Let's just say when the fabric in a dress is so stiff it can stand in the closet all by itself, it's not -- well, comfortable to wear.  It would be great to use for a sail on a boat though.  Not so great next to your skin.  I've washed it without it being dirty, just to get the sizing out of it, SIX times and it's JUST NOW beginning to soften up.  Bottom line.  If you want a dress that doesn't itch and scratch and give you hives from all the dye and sizing, then this isn't the dress for you.  If you want a dress that looks cute and only looks cute.  Go for it!  P.S.  Reminder to self.  NEVER buy a dress on-line that requires that it FIT your particular figure, because this one sure didn't!  I'm 5'6"" -- 189 lbs, size 44DD.  I ordered a Size LG and the top is way too big.  Word to the wise -- I can't recommend this dress, not for practical, go out and wear it and feel good in it purposes.  Wear it and feel like you can't move in it purposes.  Well, that's not for me.  P.P.S.  I also bought a net half slip.  Total waste of money.  The skirt on this dress flares out all by itself."
1.0,"I was very disappointed with the product, no iridescence and minimal shine, white was the only pearl like characteristic. The shipping cost was outrageous."
1.0,Material cheap and flimsy
1.0,Much smaller than expected and books were blurry. Returned.
1.0,"i am very upset dose not look anything close to pic, and horrible quality"
1.0,Cheap material and nowhere to tie it closed.
1.0,Well it was great until about a week later when the emblem fell off in my pocket and then got lost. Its clearly just hot glued on. (And not very well.) Now Its just an ugly folded metal clip. Definitely not worth 24 dollars. More like 2 dollars. This company is ripping people off. Spend your money on a different one this is not a valuable gift at all.
1.0,way too small. a 5x is more like an xl I was very upset I needed a jacket had to give it to my kid  very bad sizing chart. :(
1.0,"The product looked ok til I opened the package and only got 1 of the tuck-ins, so for that reason I'm out"
1.0,These masks were too big for my face.
1.0,Looked nothing like the pic
1.0,Originally I got size XL &amp; it fits perfect but since I was only 19 weeks pregnant so I decided to get a bigger size. I got XXXXL and it is tighter than the XL.
1.0,In my elation at finding the perfect watch band I didn't pay attention to the size. And was absolutely brokenhearted when it didn't fit my watch. Totally my fault. I've sent several emails begging COOKIVER to please make this in a smaller size. I would buy them all but as it stands I am left to hope & pray as I admire & covet this watch band on someone else's wrist.
1.0,Broke month and a half later. Junk.
1.0,Ped√≠ una unida me cobraron 2
1.0,I ordered a size large (normal size).  I bottoms fit perfectly but the top would barely accommodate a small B cup if I had to guess.  The band is similar to a 34 or 36 bra but there basically are no cups just one squished roll of boob (nobody wants that!).  So maybe if you are looking for something to accommodate a big booty and small on the top half this is for you.  For reference I wear a size 10 or 12 in jeans and a 36 D bra.
1.0,This advertised as fitting my Garmin Forerunner 15 but it is simply too narrow to fit the watch.  Totally misleading product description.
1.0,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù, athletic build. Waist size 32. The inner leg portion of shorts rubs against inner thigh bad. Trashed them."
1.0,Cloth was like raincoat...
1.0,Clearly this product was developed in China to fit Asian women's body type not American women
1.0,worst item i ever  purchased from amazon. it was achristmas present for my grandson.pegs were stuck in side holes. could only remove three using a pliers. fourth one broke off in the hole. as for the board the holes were drilled at different depths. pegs would fall out due to the holes being too shallow. very cheap board. do not buy from this seller.
1.0,honestly terrible LOL the quality is so bad
1.0,stud is bent as shown in my 1st photo so I hope it doesn‚Äôt break later. The piece is gorgeous but it‚Äôs different than the advertised piece and doesn‚Äôt stay on my ear well.  Will probably wear it on my shirt instead of my ear since it‚Äôs cute.
1.0,I bought another brand of double stick tape and it worked perfectly: stayed on tight and didn't budge. This stuff unstuck almost immediately! Didn't work at all. I'm throwing the rest out.
1.0,Ordered mermaid print. Received a bag that was part mermaid print and part bird print! Had to return. Super disappointing.
1.0,They had a hole in the toes.
1.0,"The item is gray not black and the size doesnt fit I ordered a 2xl , please fix this"
1.0,Runs super small but it‚Äôs cute
1.0,One of the ugliest dresses I've ever seen. I honestly have no clue why I even ordered it. I guess I thought the trumpet sleeve shape was nice. But it wasn't. Looked like a sack with trumpet sleeves.
1.0,It is a very nice bracelet but after wearing 3 times the colors started to fade. Now all o have is a black bracelet with a silver lion head when originally the lion was gold.
1.0,Way too tight.  We cut off the elastic (top and bottom!) to get it on but it rolls down now.  Worthless.  In this COVID world we are so used to not being able to return anything.  But how about you send us a free pair of XL!!!????  We don't have the packaging.  They don't even stay on as footless knee socks.
1.0,Going to be returned - too small
1.0,"Hahaha. These are not men‚Äôs sizes. The resting waist for large is 13‚Äù (28‚Äù) and if I stretch them as far as possible I barely get 19‚Äù (38‚Äù). They won‚Äôt even get past my knees. To return them, I have to drive 17 miles to a ups drop off location. So this purchase was a waste, get it?"
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes up as directed. Still way too small. Can not use
1.0,just use once and it‚Äôs brokenüëéüèº
1.0,The setting was so bad that the stone fell out the second time my wife wore them and thene was no stress put on the setting.  Just a waste of money.
1.0,"It's pretty but the cover for the FitBit insert can fall off, which means you would lose the FitBit"
1.0,Nada que ver com√∫n el de la foto
1.0,Dislike this ring.. Looks fake and cheap
1.0,"I was so very disappointed in this, please don‚Äôt buy!! We had a Halloween wedding to go to so we chose to dress up with a game of thrones theme. It was too late to send back so I had to wear it! The dress is held together by 2 thin ribbons so the first time you sit in it, it rips off you! I was so embarrassed but continued to fix until after the wedding was over and then had to change out of it."
1.0,"When I got it, it was all bent up couldn't wear it"
1.0,"I am 6'6 and I tried using this. Was very excited. But when it came to measurement time Amazon lost a customer. I tried placing the phone knee height, waist height, etc. It didnt matter. My body fit within the crime scene doodle perfectly. It would then tell me to backup and then never give me any more input again."
1.0,Didn‚Äôt come with the belt‚Äîreturning
1.0,I received my order with broken glasses and a hat that was unraveling. Very disappointed. I know it was only 13.00 but that was my 13.00 and it was wasted on a subpar product.
1.0,Beautiful ring my wife said but it broke the same day!
1.0,I really Like it<br />It just come broken in the neck area
1.0,Product was totally unacceptable.<br />It was &#34;rusting&#34;.<br />Returned and got money back.
1.0,Way too big. Pucture not accurate.
1.0,"This is listed as a hoodie, but that‚Äôs only it‚Äôs shape. This is some kind of Lycra, like a spandex workout material. It‚Äôs thinner than a tshirt. You‚Äôre spending for the brand, but it‚Äôs on the cheapest and most useless material for clothing imaginable."
1.0,The glue holding it together came undone. Went back to my original black band
1.0,Broke the second I took it out of the packaging. Didn't even wear it once.
1.0,"This romper is awful. Took forever to get it and is horrible. The make is super cheap looking and is gigantic on me. I am 5'2 115 pounds, athletic build and got the smallest size. Requested a return/refund, waiting a response."
1.0,This outfit was made out of very thin and cheap fabric.  I don‚Äôt think the sizes looked accurate as I purchased 2 sets for different granddaughters.  I was very disappointed in my purchase.
1.0,I ordered a 2x in this shirt and it fit like a Large. I gave it to my granddaughter. Would not recommend due to sizing being way off.
1.0,Product isn't even the same style shirt as pictured. Very cheap iron on decal as well.
1.0,Super expensive $90.00 for basically a t shirt with a Corvette logo I sent it back
1.0,"Seems like nice material and everything, but fits Myrtle sizes to small. Bought an XXL; fit in the chest/stomach seems more like a M or L, as it's 3-4 inches away from remotely being able to button. Opened the Cindy on the back all the way. I'm a large guy, and am used to stuff fitting tight, but this was just a joke."
1.0,"At first I was so excited because they seemed much better than the last set I had.<br /><br />But now I know why they sell them in a pack.<br /><br />The little rubber part that grabs the glasses arm, breaks within a week of wearing! Super lame garbage product!"
1.0,This is a cute watch but doesn't keep time.  I would not recommend. I threw away the box because it appeared fine.  Now it doesn't work.  Save your $ and buy a different one
1.0,Put this on a sieko 007 and was shocked at how small it was. Small really means small. Like for a child small. I have a 7 inch wrist and I couldn't even use the last hole on the strap.<br />Size aside the strap was wonderful. Nice thick leather with a cool pattern. Not sure it's worth $50 bucks with all the cheaper options out there plus in pretty sure that it can only be used fur a child. Price seems high to be for a kids strap but if you know the size going in and the price doesn't bother you then it's a georgous strap.
1.0,Green is the new one I got today Too short not fitting good and really thin<br />Not good product
1.0,Cute shirt but fit way smaller than other clothes I own in this size. Will be returning it.
1.0,"This bag is beautiful. This bag is fun and I really like it. However like others have said it is packaged BAD. The feather is bent badly. There are indents on his face and A LOT of loose strings on the back where Iago is. I DO NOT recommend you buy this bag from this seller. Go and get it straight from the website where you know it will be packaged right. I am not going to return this or get a new one because it was a wedding gift, but I am not happy with the quality of this bag at all. For the price you pay for Loungefly bags they should NEVER come like this. If you buy this, like myself, after seeing the reviews I will simply say this....Buy at your own risk."
1.0,Looks like a girls watch. Forgot to return it so i have a christmas gift for someone.
1.0,Makes your feet smell very very bad.
1.0,Polyester feeling cheap material. Better off hitting up  üéØ for a better quality sweatshirt.
1.0,Started falling apart after 3 days of use
1.0,"I brought a size bigger 3X and its so tight on my hips , tummy & the top pluckers out on side arms, wait and if that's bad enough, its see through outside. I feel so fooked and angered by this company."
1.0,I was so excited to get this leather strap that I immediately put it on my purse. Within about 3 seconds it broke. Buy at your own risk.
1.0,"The first time I wore them I got hit by a big wave as I was swimming it pulled off my glasses, I had this on it they did not float in my brand new prescription sunglasses were gone."
1.0,Not worth 10 cents.
1.0,Not as good of quality as expected. Logo was yellow and not orange as it should be.
1.0,This bracelet broke when my niece tried to put her charm on it. The clasp broke. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk!
1.0,I had this arrive twice...the first I had to return as the box it came in was crumpled...leaving a crumpled hat....<br />the second hat came ripped! I returned it for my money...flimsy and looked like a party favor
1.0,Took forever to arrive and material very cheap. You get what you pay for
1.0,"I really like these laces. However, I was disappointed that they only lasted a few months before one of them started breaking.  They are much pricier than other shoe laces and I assumed they would last longer.  When they worked I really liked how they worked and stayed tight during my runs.<br /><br />I tried emailing the company as these are supposed to have a lifetime guarantee.  I never heard back from them."
1.0,Came apart in less than a week. Wont buy again
1.0,"Shipping took forever and they ended up being way too small. Had they of fit, I would have been happy, as they are cute and they are soft inside. They stretch like a jegging, which I would typically order a small in, so I sized up and ordered a medium in these. I couldn't even get them all the way up. The company was quick to respond though, and I ended up getting a full refund."
1.0,"These are way to big for an earing.  I bought these for my daughter thinking she would really like them because they light up and came in several different colors.  She hasn't even worn them and she got them for Christmas and here it is the middle of February.  I tried a pair on and they are bottom heavy, meaning the back is too heavy to even out the weight and so the earing leans upward and makes your earlobe bend forward toward your face.  The diamond part of the earing is too large, they extend from the earlobe way too far to look nice.  The battery pack that is the back of the earing is also rather large.  I could see wearing these at night just for fun, but you would never wear them during the day if you wanted them to &#34;look nice&#34;.  They are also a little challenging to put on.  The back has a tiny hole that is hard to line up.  When my daughter tried them on, I had to help her and when I tried them on, I had to look in the mirror to get them on.  Not worth the cheap price."
1.0,Elastic wrist tighteners snapped right away on first time putting gloves on.
1.0,"The ties loose stitching combined with various stains, is nothing short of laughable. I thought Dan Smith was the child who put this tie together but it's actually the brand name. Hands down, the most ridiculous and comically produced tie I've ever seen. It's so bad that Stevie Wonder can see it."
1.0,"It is basically a sticker over a white shirt. If you wash the shirt, the sticker will begin to peel at the edges. Would not recommend."
1.0,like a small when xxl
1.0,Wish I could find these socks larger. I am a female who wears a 7-1/2 shoe. I can only wear them for a short time as they are small.
1.0,"Do not order from this seller. I purchased 3 Halloween mask in September and here it is in the middle of October and I have not received them. The seller claims the delay is due to Covid. Umm, none of my other packages from amazon are held up by Covid. Seller hasn‚Äôt given me a refund either."
1.0,"The dress fit fine, but it was too short. Im 5'8, and the 4x came above my ankles."
1.0,The hands didn‚Äôt work properly
1.0,This makes my foot have arthritis and make my foot itch
1.0,Belt was not patent leather at all as described ! Disappointed üòî
1.0,I don't even know any kids this would fit. :-/
1.0,"TINY!!!  Would fit a toddler, not even a 5 year old."
1.0,"I ordered these because my grandson loved the tiger motif. These shoes have a number of features that seem designed to ensure that the shoes will be uncomfortable to the point of painful,  ignoring that the size 9's  were also smaller than size 8s that my grandson was outgrowing. My grandson kept saying ""Ow!Ow!Ow!"" the first time we put them on his feet. I looked inside the shoe and there is a wide stiff band of elastic  that goes over the top that ends in a raw stiff edge, and the inside of the shoe in the toe box has a bunch of raised bumps. I could also barely stuff his foot in them. They are going directly into the garbage - I wouldn't even donate them, the design is so poor, and I don't want someone else to buy them only to find out how awful they are.  They are very cute, but completely unwearable. I received another pair of size 9 shoes by Osh-Kosh the same day  that are a bit loose on him, but socks will make them fit. There is no way that he could wear any socks with these."
1.0,"This item is extremely poor quality, and was ripped before even opening the package. Not worth the wait at all. The size run way smaller as well."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Disappointed
1.0,It fit but I couldn't hear nothing when it was on my phone
1.0,Received product without tie so looked huge. Not a common fabric so it‚Äôs not like you can use another tie. Returned.
1.0,"These run way to big. I ordered M size, the size that I always wear, and it feels like XXXXXXXL."
1.0,"It was very beautiful when it showed up, but it left my bellybutton infected , even after I soaked in alcohol before use :("
1.0,This does not stay tight on my sun vizor.  Also the shades do not stay in place.  I wish I could return this item.
1.0,"It worked for about a month.... now we can no longer set time/date/alarm, so its useless... DO NOT BUY"
1.0,They fit great but they aren‚Äôt distressed like the picture. Literally just a few blunt cuts across some normal bell bottom jeans.
1.0,Not a good product...would not buy again...
1.0,"This suit runs EXTREMELY small. I wear a size 12 and ordered an XL.  When it arrived, I could tell this suit wasn‚Äôt going to fit me from the moment I took it out of the packaging. It was the equivalent of a small!!!!  I ended up giving it to my daughter. If you buy this, order 4 sizes bigger than what you actually wear."
1.0,Color was very off from image. Will be returning for refund.
1.0,Son wore these for a couple hours and half of the right shoe won't light up. Returning for a full refund!
1.0,"They don‚Äôt stay on, they seem to be cut off."
1.0,"These boots look much prettier when you have them on. However, there are extremely uncomfortable. I couldn't leave the house in them on."
1.0,Didnt work for me and I have used multi- focal glasses prior. These are blurry. I will be returning.  Disappointed because the frame is super cute.
1.0,Not real size
1.0,Way bigger than advertised
1.0,opens all the time
1.0,Within one week the lights no longer work
1.0,Came brooken..
